{"id": "8613151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8613151", "title": "Business economics", "text": "Business economics\n\nBusiness economics is a field in applied economics which uses economic theory and quantitative methods to analyze business enterprises and the factors contributing to the diversity of organizational structures and the relationships of firms with labour, capital and product markets. A professional focus of the journal \"Business Economics\" has been expressed as providing \"practical information for people who apply economics in their jobs.\"\nBusiness economics is an integral part of traditional economics. It is an extension of economic concepts to the real business situations. It is an applied science in the sense of a tool of managerial decision-making and forward planning by management. In other words, Business economics is concerned with the application of economic theory to business management.\n\nBusiness economics is concerned with economic issues and problems related to business organization, management, and strategy. Issues and problems include: an explanation of why \"corporate\" firms emerge and exist; why they expand: horizontally, vertically and spacially; the role of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship; the significance of organizational structure; the relationship of firms with the employees, the providers of capital, the customers, the government; the interactions between firms and the business environment.\n\nThe term 'business economics' is used in a variety of ways. Sometimes it is used as synonymously with industrial economics/industrial organisation, managerial economics, and economics for business. Still, there may be substantial differences in the usage of 'economics for business' and 'managerial economics' with the latter used more narrowly.\nOne view of the distinctions between these would be that business economics is wider in its scope than industrial economics in that it would be concerned not only with \"industry\" but also businesses in the service sector. Economics for business looks at the major principles of economics but focuses on applying these economic principles to the real world of business. Managerial economics is the application of economic methods in the managerial decision-making process.\n\nMany universities offer courses in business economics and offer a range of interpretations as to the meaning of the word.\n\nThe Bachelor of Business Economics (BBE) Program at University of Delhi is designed to meet the growing need for an analytical and quantitative approach to problem solving in the changing corporate world by the application of the latest techniques evolved in the fields of economics and business.\n\nThe Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB), the Universidad Pública de Navarra (UPNa) and the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB) developed an official Master of Science in Management, Organization and Business Economics focused on management and business topics to train professionals in the study of organizations, on a conceptual and quantitative basis. To achieve this, advanced analysis tools are used from the fields of Neoclassical economics, New institutional economics, Statistics, Econometrics and Operations research. This focus is complemented with contributing ideas and theories to develop the necessary instruments to facilitate the management of sophisticated and complex organizations.\n\nThe program at Harvard University uses economic methods to analyze practical aspects of business, including business administration, management, and related fields of business economics.\n\nThe University of Miami defines business economics as involving the study of how we use our resources for the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. This requires business economists to analyze social institutions, banks, the stock market, the government and their relationships with labor negotiations, taxes, international trade, and urban and environmental issues.\n\nCourses at the University of Manchester interpret business economics to be concerned with the economic analysis of how businesses contribute to welfare of society rather than on the welfare of an individual or a business. This is done via an examination of the relationship between ownership, control and firm objectives; theories of the growth of the firm; the behavioural theory of the firm; theories of entrepreneurship; the factors that influence the structure, conduct and performance of business at the industry level.\n\nItalian Universities borrow their concept of business economics from the tradition of Gino Zappa, for example a standard course at the Politecnico di Milano involves studying corporate governance, accounting, investment analysis, budgeting and business strategy.\n\nLa Trobe University of Melbourne, Australia associates business economics with the process of demand, supply and equilibrium coordinating the behaviour of individuals and businesses in the market. Also, business economics extends to government policy, economic variables and international factors which influence business and competition.\n\n\n\n"}

The CCI aims to educate the public about copyright law; coordinates with copyright owners and Internet service providers (ISPs) about issues related to online copyright infringement; assists with the design, implementation, review, and promotion of an online infringement notification and mitigation system (the Copyright Alert System); collects and disseminates online infringement data; and promotes lawful means of obtaining copyrighted works. The organization was created as a partnership between industry associations, including the Motion Picture Association of America, the Recording Industry Association of America, and five major American Internet service providers.\n\nThe Center for Copyright Information was formed in September 2011 to coordinate efforts between the television, film and music industries and service providers to curb online copyright infringement and educate Internet subscribers about the issue. The RIAA began negotiations to create the Center for Copyright Information and its Copyright Alert System in December 2008, after it ceased a five-year litigation campaign against individual file sharers. Between 2003 and 2008, the RIAA adopted a practice of suing individual file sharers; previously it had focused on efforts to shut down peer-to-peer file sharing services.\n\nThe MPAA and RIAA, along with the Independent Film & Television Alliance and American Association of Independent Music, as associations representing independent producers in their fields, reached an agreement in July 2011 with five large ISPs to create the Copyright Alerts System. The trade groups argued copyright infringement was costing the U.S. economy hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in lost earnings and tax revenue annually. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo helped bring parties to the table as part of his 2008 work with Internet service providers to block access to online child pornography. Under the July 2011 agreement, several U.S. Internet service providers, including Verizon Communications, Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Cablevision Systems and AT&T agreed to send alerts to customers who appeared to be using their accounts for illegal downloading. At the time of the agreement 75% of all broadband internet usage was provided by one of these five companies. The Memorandum of Understanding established that copyright holders and ISP’s would split the costs of the system 50/50. According to the CCI’s first tax filing, chronicling the first 8 months of the companies operations, CSA operation costs were $1,377,633.00. In July 2011, the Obama administration praised the formation of the CCI on the official White House Blog as \"a positive step” and consistent with the executive branch’s strategy of encouraging voluntary intellectual property enforcement. In 2011, the CCI had its corporate status revoked according to the Columbia Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs for failing to file the proper paperwork, which they quickly resolved. In 2013, the CCI announced it would be supporting iKeepSafe’s pilot program. iKeepSafe, is an independently created curriculum designed to educate children about copyright law and fair use in the digital age.\n\nCCI is led by an executive committee, with Executive Director Jill Lesser as its head. Lesser was previously the senior vice president of domestic public policy for AOL, as well as the deputy director of public policy at People for the American Way.\n\nIn addition, the CCI has an advisory board which \"consults actively on issues the Executive Committee is considering.\" The CCI's original advisory board includes consumer advocates Jerry Berman, founder of the Center for Democracy and Technology; Gigi Sohn, president and CEO of Public Knowledge; and Jules Polonetsky, director and co-chair of the Future of Privacy Forum. Leslie Harris, former President of the Center of Democracy and Technology replaced Gigi Sohn when she was asked by the Chairman of Federal Communication’s Commission, Tom Wheeler, to run the FCC’s External Affairs branch.\n\nThe Copyright Alert System uses third parties to identify when copyrighted information is shared via peer-to-peer services. These third parties inform Internet service providers, which then send an alert to the relevant customer. The Copyright Alert System was launched in February 2013 by the Center for Copyright Information. The CCI has stated that the primary goal of the system is \"to make consumers aware of activity that has occurred using their Internet accounts, educate them on how they can prevent such activity from happening again, and provide information about the growing number of ways to access digital content legally.\"\n\n\n"}

He founded and chaired the Evergreen Group.\n\nChang was born in Su'ao, while Taiwan was under Japanese rule. When he was seven, the family moved to Keelung. After graduating from Taipei Commercial High School at the age of 18, he went to work in the Taipei office of a Japanese shipping line. He continued his education by taking night classes at a vocational school in Taipei.\n\nAfter World War II, he joined the seagoing staff of a local shipping company as third officer. His subsequent career was spent with various local companies and he progressed through the ranks to captain.\n\nIn 1961, Chang and some friends jointly established a shipping company and, having helped this company to develop, he decided to branch out on his own, establishing Evergreen Marine Corporation on 1 September 1968 with just one secondhand 15,000 ton vessel, Central Trust.\n\nOver the next four years, Chang built his fleet up to twelve, running them empty when necessary to convince his customers his services were regular and reliable. Within a year, he had expanded to the Middle East. Within three, Chang was dispatching Evergreen ships to the Caribbean.\n\nIn 1975, Chang realised that containerisation was the way forward. He built four advanced S-type container ships and launched his US East Coast service. Fifteen months later, he added the West coast of the United States to his network. Europe followed in 1979.\n\nBy 1984, he started his most ambitious service yet- two 80-day round-the-world services, one circling the globe in an easterly direction, the other westward. Departing every 10 days, the 20 G-type container ships he employed had a capacity of 2,728 containers each and could travel at a speed of 20.5 knots.\n\nThe Evergreen Group has expanded beyond the shipping industry to encompass operations in heavy industrial development, air transport, hotels and resorts services.\n\nThe Evergreen Group, with over 27,000 employees and more than 220 offices worldwide, now comprises about 30 major corporations worldwide, 3 of which are listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. During the 2012 Republic of China presidential election, Mr Chang expressed his disapproval of the so-called Taiwan Consensus. The China Post reported that he said that the \"\"Taiwan Consensus\" smacks of Taiwan independence\" which the paper said was \"not his cup of tea\". In February 2012, it was reported that Chang had pledged \"to give away all his wealth\" (approximately US$1.69 billion), primarily via the Chang Yung-fa Foundation.\n\nChang was married twice, first to Lin Chin-chih, with whom he had four children. His second wife Lee Yu-mei bore him one son. On 20 January 2016, Chang died at the age of 88.\n\n\n\n"}

The diversified business empire he created played a key role in helping to link Argentina with the trading and financial systems of the first world. Amongst many other achievements, he founded the Tornquist Bank, the Plaza Hotel in Buenos Aires, the partido of Tornquist and Tornquist its main city, in the south of Buenos Aires Province.\n\nBorn in Buenos Aires in 1842, Ernesto Tornquist was the seventh son of Jorge Pedro Ernesto Tornquist (1801-1876), a Lutheran born in Baltimore, United States and whose parents came from a German family in the city of Hamburg with roots in Karlskrona in Sweden. The father was consul of the city of Bremen in Montevideo, Uruguay, and was an importer and property investor in Buenos Aires. His mother, Rosa Camusso Alsina, a Catholic, was born in Buenos Aires in 1805 and died there of yellow fever in 1871.\n\nTornquist started his schooling at Escuela Evangélica Alemana and in 1856 was sent to study in Germany in the city of Krefeld for two years. On his return to Argentina he took up a job working for a company directed by his brother-in-law which exported wool and leather and imported agricultural machinery. In 1872 he married his niece, Rosa Altgelt Tornquist in Buenos Aires, and in 1874 took over the running of his brother-in-law’s company which was now renamed, \"Ernesto Tornquist y Cia\". With the help of Belgium capital the company diversified its activities to include investment in the sugar, meat-salting and cold-storage industries. The company also invested in railways and acquired land in the provinces of Santa Fe and Entre Rios, previously occupied by Indians. In the 1880s he set up a large sugar refinery, \"Refineria Argentina\", in Rosario. Other initiatives included founding the \"Bieckert\" brewery, the \"Seeber\" margarine manufacturer and the \"Bianchetti\" scale manufacturer.\nOn 17 April 1883 he founded Tornquist, the main city of Tornquist Partido, in the south of Buenos Aires Province. From the beginning the town was organized as an agricultural colony for German and Volga German immigrants. After the economic crisis of 1890 he took charge of organizing the recovery of the company \"Sansinena\" and its cold-storage plant \"La Negra\" in Riachuelo and set up the plant \"Cuartreros\" in Bahía Blanca.\n\nAmongst other activities the Tornquist group organised the hunting of whales (not controversial in those days) around the South Georgia Islands through the \"Compañía Argentina de Pesca\", oil exploration in Mendoza, the exploitation of quebracho in Santiago del Estero and the construction of the Ferrocarril del Norte de Santa Fe with the help of Belgium capital.\n\nErnesto Tornquist played a crucial role in helping to avoid a war between Argentina and Chile in 1902 by managing the British mediation in the border dispute, and by strongly opposing the bellicose Foreign Minister Estanislao Zeballos. He represented the German armaments group Krupp in Buenos Aires where he organised a strong lobby for the armaments industry, whilst on the other hand he helped to resolve a conflict with Brazil.\n\nIn 1903 he built the estancia, \"Sierra de la Ventana\", in Tornquist, designed by the German immigrant architect Carlos Nordmann in Gothic style typical of German castles in the Rhine Valley. The grounds were designed by the French immigrant landscape architect, Carlos Thays.\n\nHe maintained a close friendship with Argentine presidents Julio A. Roca and Carlos Pellegrini and tenaciously opposed the militaristic plans of the War Minister Estanislao Zeballos during the presidency of José Figueroa Alcorta (1906-1910).\n\nIn 1909 he built the Plaza Hotel (today called the Marriott Plaza Hotel), designed by the German architect Alfredo Zucker, in Florida street, overlooking Plaza San Martin in Buenos Aires.\n\nHe died in 1908 in Buenos Aires and since 1980 his remains are buried in the local church in the town of Tornquist.\n\n\n"}

She was a great patron of the arts and parts of her collection became the object of a lawsuit following her death.\n\nRockefeller was born in New York City, New York on April 3, 1882 to Almira Geraldine Goodsell and William Rockefeller She grew up at Rockwood Hall, her father's estate in Mount Pleasant, New York.\n\nShe married Marcellus Hartley Dodge Sr., president of The Remington Arms Company and, she brought into the marriage an estimated personal fortune of $101 million. They were married on April 18, 1907 in Manhattan, where both resided, in a small ceremony at the residence of the bride's family, following the contemporary customs dictated by a mourning period after the death of the groom's father in February.\n\nThe couple had only one child, Marcellus Hartley Dodge Jr., whom they called \"Hartley\". He was killed in an automobile accident on August 29, 1930 in Mogesca, France. In his memory, his mother purchased a large parcel of land for twenty thousand dollars and gave Madison, New Jersey the property and the Hartley Dodge Memorial Building which was dedicated on Memorial Day, Thursday, May 30, 1935 and used as the borough hall. \"The New York Times\" published that the building cost $800,000. Mrs. Dodge also donated the train station. These structures became the core of the Madison Civic Commercial District, which is listed on the State Register of Historic Places and the National Register of Historic Places. They made many other significant donations in his name. During the early part of their marriage they resided together at \"Hartley Farms\". Eventually, while in New Jersey, they resided on separate, but abutting, country estates: \"Giralda Farms\" and \"Hartley Farms\" hers fronting the main route from Madison to Morristown and extending to his that faced south and fronted on Spring Valley Road in New Vernon. A long private path extended for miles from one house to the other with gates at either side of Woodland Road, which defined the southern boundary of her property.\n\nShe died in 1973, and was buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery.\n\nGeraldine R. Dodge judged at major dog shows in every American state as well as the premier shows in Germany, Canada, Ireland, and England.

Rine.\n\nShe was recognized as a philanthropist, a benefactor to communities, the arts, nonprofit and natural resource efforts, as an author, a judge of dogs, a breeder of dogs, the founder of the Morris and Essex Dog Club and its internationally recognized annual exhibition in May that was considered the most prestigious dog show held in the United States of America for decades, and the founder of a refuge for injured and lost animals.\n\nAt her death she left $85 million to establish the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation, which continues her work, including the Geraldine R. Dodge Poetry Festival.\n\nUnfortunately, the historic residence of Geraldine R. Dodge was demolished by the insurance company that bought the estate following her death. The grand home was built in the style of Giralda in Seville. She had purchased it in 1923 from Charles W. Harkness, the third largest holder of stock in Standard Oil while she and her husband were assembling properties that adjoined. Mr. Dodge's property extended to the edge of the Great Swamp that is a remnant from the Glacial Lake Passaic. His property has been preserved through a conservation easement and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThey were instrumental in helping those in the \"Jersey Jetport Site Association\", which began the campaign to save that vast swamp from development as an airport, by providing funds for the initial purchases of core properties in 1959. Acquisition of a significant area of land was required for it to qualify as a large enough gift to the federal government that could be set aside, forever, as a federal park.\n\nHer husband was one of the first trustees of the \"North American Wildlife Foundation\" that completed the acquisition.

Since the GAO is accountable only to the legislative branch, it is in a unique position to investigate the military; no other agency can audit Federal departments with the same degree of independence from the President. However, the GAO is still subject to influence from powerful members of Congress. As of March 2016, the DoD was the only government agency to have failed every audit since all government agencies were required to pass such audits by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990.\n\nTwo examples of major GAO investigations in the 2000s were the audits of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Defense Department airline reimbursements.\n\nGAO investigations into Operation Iraqi Freedom revealed a number of accounting problems, ranging from the mundane to the severe. Pay irregularities were a chronic problem. In 2004 the GAO reported that 450 of the 481 Army National Guard soldiers from six Special Forces units had at least one pay problem associated with their mobilization impacting 94 percent of the soldiers. The report found that the DoD's inability to provide timely and accurate payments to these soldiers, many of whom risked their lives in Iraq or Afghanistan, distracted them from their missions, imposed financial hardships on the soldiers and their families and may reduce retention.\n\nProcurement irregularities included Halliburton charging the government $5 for hot meals they got from a Kuwaiti subcontractor, Timimmi, for $3 each. In one camp in July 2003 they \"billed the government for an average 42,000 meals a day but served only 14,000. In a seven-month period, alleged overcharging in that camp totalled $16m.\"\n\nAs the investigation into Iraqi Freedom progressed, it began turning up worse and worse procurement problems. GAO auditors caught the Department selling new chemical and biological protective garments on the Internet for $3 each. At the same time, the Pentagon was buying identical garments elsewhere for more than $200 apiece. Other accounting snafus resulted in the Army losing track of 56 airplanes, 32 tanks, and 36 Javelin missile command launch-units. In May 2003 SFGATE reported $1 trillion missing.\n\nThe GAO found that the waste encountered in Iraq is symptomatic of a wider inventory-control problem. More than 200 inventory-control systems at the Defense Department still are not integrated.\n\nThe GAO notes, \"Poor communication between services within the Department of Defense and improper accounting results in the disposal of needed spare parts and the purchase of duplicative parts worth millions of dollars.\"\n\nA more recent GAO investigation revealed $100 million in wasted airline fees. The Associated Press notes that the Defense Department spent an estimated $100 million for airline tickets that were not used over six years and failed to seek refunds even though the tickets were reimbursable. The Department also reimbursed employees for airline tickets that had been purchased by the Department. To demonstrate how easy it was to have the Pentagon pay for airline travel, the investigators posed as Defense employees, had the department generate a ticket and showed up at the ticket counter to pick up a boarding pass.\n\nThe GAO also uncovered several incidences of airline-related fraud. One DoD traveler used a Department account number to pay for more than 70 airline tickets totaling more than $60,000. He then sold them at a discount to coworkers and family members for personal travel. Another employee admitted to \"accidentally\" claiming reimbursement for $10,000 worth of airline tickets that had been paid for by the Department.\n\nThere is evidence that GAO investigations are encouraging the Department to reform. The Halliburton contract was re-negotiated and assigned directly to Timimmi. And Dov Zakheim, chief financial officer for the Pentagon, said, \"We are overhauling our financial management system precisely because people like <nowiki>[</nowiki>GAO Comptroller General<nowiki>]</nowiki> David Walker are rightly critical of it\".\n\nThese audits appear to have been more effective at prompting reform than the Defense Department's own initiatives. In 1989, the Department began attempting to unify more than 2,000 overlapping systems used for billing, inventory, and personnel. But after spending $20 billion, the initiative was abandoned. Gregory Kutz, director of GAO's financial management division, noted the Pentagon's weak fiscal control over its subsidiaries – the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines – saying, \"The [Pentagon's] inability to even complete an audit shows just how far they have to go.\"\n\nScholars believe, however, that the GAO's authority could be undermined in the wake of a landmark case, Walker vs. Cheney. This Federal lawsuit pertained to a GAO investigation into the Bush Administration's Energy Task Force. Vice President Richard Cheney refused to disclose which individuals and groups met with the Task Force, prompting Walker to sue for the information in Federal court. In December 2002, the court ruled for Cheney.\n\nCongressional pressure persuaded Walker to abandon appeals. Having vowed to \"go to the mat,\" he originally planned to pursue the case further. But according to the Center for Effective Government,\n\nThe Center for Effective Government reported that, \"Sen. Ted Stevens (R-AK), chairman of the Appropriations Committee, met with GAO Comptroller General David Walker earlier in [2003], and sources have reported that sharp cuts in the GAO $440 million budget were threatened if the lawsuit was pursued further.\n\nThe GAO was designed to be independent, and Walker cites several factors insulating his agency from political pressure. In a Roll Call op-ed, he remarks, \"To begin with, our location in the legislative branch gives us some distance from the executive branches we audit and oversee. Moreover, the head of GAO serves a 15-year term, which gives the agency a continuity of leadership that is rare in the federal government. GAO's independence is further safeguarded by the fact that its workforce consists of career civil servants hired on the basis of their knowledge, skill, and ability.\"\n\nHowever, the GAO, like all federal agencies, is subject to Congress' budgetary power. According to \"The Hill\", \"Walker did say . . . that several lawmakers have threatened in the past year to cut agency funding if it persisted with the controversial lawsuit. He also said the budget threat was among a number of factors that tipped his Feb. 7 decision to halt litigation.\"\n\nIt is difficult to tell whether curtailed GAO independence will threaten Defense Department reform. Some aspects of Defense Department accounting have resisted reform for decades. Danielle Brian, director of the nonprofit Project on Government Oversight, says, \"Waste has become ingrained in the Defense budget because opposition to defense spending is portrayed as unpatriotic, and legislators are often more concerned about winning Pentagon pork than controlling defense waste.\"\n\nBut even Representatives who generally support Defense spending seem to be getting fed up with the problem. Representative Thomas M. Davis, R-Virginia, asked the Pentagon to present 11 documents relating to contracts in Iraq, among them papers that would prove whether Halliburton benefited from its association with Cheney. And Rep. John Duncan, R-Tenn., of the House Committee on Government Reform recently said, \"I've always considered myself to be a pro-military type person, but that doesn't mean I just want to sit back and watch the Pentagon waste billions and billions of dollars.\"\n\nSupporters of the GAO investigations like to point out the disparity between the GAO budget and military expenses. The GAO's Fiscal Year 2016 annual budget was $555 million, with \"Measurable financial benefits from GAO work: $63.4 billion--a return of about $112 on every dollar invested in GAO.\" In contrast, GAO reports show that the Defense Department's 2,200 overlapping financial systems cost $18 billion a year to operate.\n\nIn March 2016, the Project on Government Oversight reported that, \"The Department of Defense remains the only federal agency that can't get a clean audit\". DoD sources said, \"I think we are on the right track [but] it will take a couple more years.\" However, \"unless efforts to hold the Pentagon accountable become law, it's unlikely that the largest government agency will be able to be audited any time soon.\n"}

In 1912 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his \"invention of automatic regulators for use in conjunction with gas accumulators for illuminating lighthouses and buoys\".\n\nDalén was born in Stenstorp, a small village in Falköping Municipality, Västra Götaland County. He managed the family farm, which he expanded to include a market garden, a seed merchants and a dairy. In 1892 he invented a milk-fat tester to check milk quality of the milk delivered and went to Stockholm to show his new invention for Gustaf de Laval. de Laval was impressed by the self-taught Dalén and the invention and encouraged him to get a basic technical education. He was admitted to the Chalmers University of Technology where he earned his Master's degree and a Doctorate on leaving in 1896. Dalén was much the same type of inventor as Gustaf de Laval, not afraid of testing \"impossible\" ideas, but Dalén was much more careful with the company economy. The products should have a solid market place before he introduced a new product.\n\nIn 1906 Dalén became chief engineer at the Gas Accumulator Company (manufacturer and distributor of acetylene) and in 1909 when AGA was founded, he was appointed the managing director for the company. During his life, AGA was one of the most innovative companies in Sweden and produced a large variety of products that grew every year. Finally in the early 1970s AGA was forced to reduce the number of markets it was involved in and concentrate on the production of gases for industrial use.\n\nIn 1909 he ascended to the position of Managing Director of the renamed company Svenska Aktiebolaget Gasaccumulator (AGA). AGA developed lighthouses using Dalén's products. In 1910 the company bought a large real estate in Lidingö and built a production plant that was completed around 1912, when they moved out from the facilities in Stockholm.\n\nInitially Dalén worked with acetylene (IUPAC: ethyne), a flammable and sometimes explosive hydrocarbon gas. Dalén invented Agamassan (Aga), a substrate used to absorb the gas allowing safe storage and hence commercial exploitation.\n\nAcetylene produced an ultra-bright white light which superseded the less bright LPG as the fuel of choice for lighthouse illumination.\n\nDalén exploited the new fuel, developing the Dalén light which incorporated another invention, the sun valve. This device allowed the light to operate only at night, conserving fuel, and extending their service life to over a year.\n\nThe 'Dalen Flasher' was a device that, except for a small pilot light, only consumed gas during the flash stage. This reduced gas consumption by more than 90%. The AGA lighthouse equipment worked without any type of electric supply and was thus extremely reliable.\n\nTo a rugged coastal area like Scandinavia, his mass-produced, robust, minimal maintenance buoys were a significant boon to safety and livelihood. AGA Lighthouses covered the entire Panama Canal.\n\nIn 1922 he patented his invention of the AGA cooker. Most of the testing for the cooker was made in his private kitchen in his Villa Ekbacken that was built when AGA moved to Lidingö in 1912 but that he never actually had a chance to see with his own eyes. His family helped him with the development work, checking temperatures, airflow etc., as the development work proceeded.\n\nHis parents were Anders and Lovisa Dalén. He married Elma Persson in 1901. They had four children, two daughters and two sons;\n\nEarly in 1912, Dalén was blinded in an acetylene explosion during a test of maximum pressure for the accumulators. Later the same year he was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics. Too ill to attend the presentation, Dalén had his brother, ophthalmologist Professor Albin Dalén of the Caroline Institute, stand in his place.\n\nThe presentation speech praised the quality of sacrificing personal safety in scientific experimentation, a compliment that compared Dalén with Nobel himself. Despite his blindness, Dalén controlled AGA until his death in 1937. He received over 100 patents during his lifetime.\n\n\n\n"}

Thus information is not adequately shared but rather remains sequestered within each system or subsystem, figuratively trapped within a container like grain is trapped within a silo: there may be a lot of it, and it may be stacked quite high and freely available within those limits, but it has no effect outside those limits. Such data silos are proving to be an obstacle for businesses wishing to use data mining to make productive use of their data. \nInformation silos occur whenever a data system is incompatible or not integrated with other data systems. This incompatibility may occur in the technical architecture, in the application architecture, or in the data architecture of any data system. However, since it has been shown that established data modeling methods are the root cause of the data integration problem , most data systems are at least incompatible in the data architecture layer.\n\nIn management the term silo mentality often refers to information silos in organizations. Silo mentality is caused by divergent goals of different organizational units. It can also be described as a variant of the principal-agent problem. Silo mentality preferably occurs in larger organizations and can lead to a decreased performance and has a negative impact on the corporate culture. Silo mentality can be countered by the introduction of shared goals, the increase of internal networking activities and the flattening of hierarchies. \n\nPredictors for the occurrence of silos are \n\nThis should not be confused with a data silo in computing, like application virtualization, operating-system-level virtualization, or a separation kernel.\n\nThe term functional silo syndrome was coined in 1988 by Phil S.

B.\" Pritzker (born January 19, 1965) is an American businessman, philanthropist, and politician who is the Governor-elect of Illinois. He is a private business owner based in Chicago and a managing partner and co-founder of the Pritzker Group. He is a member of the Pritzker family who own the Hyatt hotel chain, and has an estimated personal net worth of $3.5 billion.\n\nPritzker was the Democratic nominee for Governor of Illinois in the 2018 gubernatorial election. He defeated Republican incumbent Bruce Rauner in the general election on November 6, 2018. As governor, he will hold more private wealth than any other governor in U.S. history and will be the second-wealthiest U.S. politician to have ever held office, after Michael Bloomberg.\n\nJ.B. Pritzker was born in California, to a Jewish family prominent in business and philanthropy during the late 20th century. The Pritzkers are consistently named near the top of the \"Forbes\" \"America's Richest Families\" list since its 1982 inception. One of three children of Sue (née Sandel) and Donald Pritzker, elder siblings are Penny Pritzker, 38th United States Secretary of Commerce, and Anthony Pritzker.\n\nHe attended Massachusetts boarding school Milton Academy and then graduated from Duke University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science. Pritzker went on to earn his Juris Doctor degree from Northwestern University School of Law. He is an attorney and a member of the Illinois State Bar Association and the Chicago Bar Association.\n\nPritzker served as chairman of ChicagoNEXT, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel's council on innovation and technology, and he founded 1871, (named for the year of the Great Chicago Fire), Chicago's digital startup center. He played an important role in the creation of the Illinois Venture Capital Association and the Chicagoland Entrepreneurial Center. He also co-founded Chicago Ventures and funded the startup of Techstars Chicago and Built in Chicago.\n\nTogether with his brother Tony, Pritzker co-founded Pritzker Group Private Capital, which owns and operates middle-market companies. The group includes a growing family of companies including pallet rental leader PECO Pallet and medical device maker Clinical Innovations. In 2008, Pritzker received the Entrepreneurial Champion Award from the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce for his efforts to promote economic development and job creation.\n\nIn the 2008 presidential election, Pritzker served as national co-chairman of Hillary Clinton's campaign. He was a delegate to the 2008 Democratic National Convention and the 2016 Democratic National Convention. He supported President Barack Obama in the 2008 general election and helped bring the Clinton and Obama campaigns in Illinois together.\n\nPritzker founded Democratic Leadership for the 21st Century, a national organization dedicated to attracting voters under the age of 40 to the Democratic Party. He also served on the Washington, D.C., legislative staffs of U.S. Senator Terry Sanford (D-NC), U.S. Senator Alan J. Dixon (D-IL), and U.S. Congressman Tom Lantos (D-CA), for whom he handled multiple domestic and international issues.\n\nIn 1998, he ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in Illinois's 9th congressional district, spending a half million dollars from his personal fortune on television ads in the Chicago market. Pritzker finished last among three candidates in the Democratic primary, receiving 20.48% of the vote, to then State Representative Jan Schakowsky's 45.14% and State Senator Howard W. Carroll's 34.40%.\n\nIn May 2017, the \"Chicago Tribune\" published an 11-minute FBI wiretap of J.B. Pritzker and then-Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich in 2008 discussing campaign contributions and options for Pritzker to be appointed to statewide office. At the time, Pritzker was described as a \"businessman with political ambitions\". On the tapes, Blagojevich asked Pritzker if he would like to be appointed state treasurer, to which Pritzker responded, \"Yeah, that's the one I would want.\" The tapes have raised questions of \"pay to play politics\", with both Republicans and Democrats, including incumbent GOP Governor Bruce Rauner and Pritzker's Democratic primary opponents, taking issue with Pritzker's conduct. Pritzker has responded to the allegations by stating: \"I've not been accused of any wrongdoing. I have not done anything wrong.\" No allegations of wrongdoing were ever made by law enforcement against Pritzker, and Pritzker has said: \"over decades of my life, I have been doing public service, and the opportunity to continue to do public service as treasurer of the state was something that had been brought up, and so there was a conversation about that.\"\n\nOn April 6, 2017, Pritzker announced he was running for the Democratic nomination for Governor of Illinois. His campaign received the endorsements of Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White, Illinois Congressman Luis Gutiérrez, former Illinois Congressman Glenn Poshard, more than a dozen members of the Illinois General Assembly, twenty-one local labor unions, and the Illinois AFL-CIO.\n\nOn August 10, 2017, Pritzker announced that his running mate would be State Representative Juliana Stratton. By December 2017, Pritzker had spent US$42million of his own wealth on his campaign, without significant fundraising from any other source. On March 20, 2018, he won the Democratic gubernatorial primary. In the November general election, Pritzker defeated incumbent Republican governor Bruce Rauner. Pritzker received 54% of the vote, while Rauner received 39%. By the time of his election, Pritzker had spent US$171.5 million of his own wealth on his campaign, primarily on digital outreach, television advertising, and staff.\n\nPritzker supports Syrian refugees and has criticized the Trump administration and Rauner for \"turning a blind eye on them\". He also supports enhancing funding for immigrant and refugee services, increasing health care options for undocumented adults, improving the U-Visa certification process for victims of violent crimes, and providing access to financial aid for undocumented students such as DACA recipients. Pritzker has said he would sign the \"Illinois Trust Act\", a pro-immigration bill.\n\nPritzker has been a long time advocate of LGBT rights and has actively participated in the Chicago Gay Pride Parade. As part of his 2018 gubernatorial race, Pritzker has stated that his administration will address anti-LGBT hate crimes, expand LGBT access to healthcare, and oppose anti-LGBT legislation.\n\nPritzker is a supporter of legalization of cannabis in Illinois.\n\nPritzker is a supporter of abortion and abortion facilities. During the 2018 gubernatorial Democratic primaries, Planned Parenthood supported Pritzker along with Kennedy and Biss.\n\nPritzker is a supporter of net neutrality and has stated on his gubernatorial campaign website: \"As governor, I will ensure that all internet traffic is treated equally so that everyone can continue to use the internet to grow their businesses, further their education, and enjoy the freedom of expression.\"\n\nAs president of the Pritzker Family Foundation, he funds research and programs focused on children in poverty. Under the leadership of Nobel Prize-winning economist James Heckman, he supported the creation of the Pritzker Consortium on Early Childhood Development at the University of Chicago.\nAlong with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Buffett Early Childhood Fund, the Irving Harris Foundation, and the George Kaiser Family Foundation, the Pritzker Family Foundation is a founding supporter of the First Five Years Fund, an organization focusing nationwide attention and resources on comprehensive, quality early care and learning programs for children from birth to age five.\nIn 2013, Pritzker teamed with Goldman Sachs to fund the first ever social impact bond for early childhood education.\n\nAs chairman of the Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center, which opened in 2009, Pritzker successfully led the capital campaign and planning to build an international institution in the Midwest dedicated to teaching the lessons of the Holocaust and other genocides. Pritzker is the principal funder of Cambodia Tribunal Monitor, the most significant online source for news and commentaries regarding the international criminal tribunal created to bring to justice the perpetrators of Pol Pot era acts of genocide. He served as chairman of the Illinois Human Rights Commission, and was succeeded by former White House counsel and Federal Judge Abner J. Mikva. In 2013, Pritzker received the Survivors' Legacy Award for his leadership in the creation of the Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center.\n\nIn 2007, Pritzker and his wife donated $5 million to the University of South Dakota to build the Theodore R. and Karen K. Muenster University Center in honor of his wife's parents. In 2011, Milton Academy dedicated the Pritzker Science Center for which Pritzker provided the lead gift. Pritzker is a trustee and serves on the investment committee of Northwestern University and is a member of the Board of Governors of Northwestern University School of Law. He is a member of the Economic Club of Chicago and the Commercial Club of Chicago.\n\nOn October 22, 2015, Northwestern University School of Law announced that J.B. Pritzker and his wife, M. K. Pritzker, had made a $100 million gift to the law school in honor of Pritzker's great-grandfather, Nicholas J. Pritzker. The 156-year-old school became named the Northwestern Pritzker School of Law.\n\nHe received the Spirit of Erikson Institute Award for his creation of the Children's Initiative.\n\nThe Better Government Association, an Illinois watchdog, has criticized Pritzker's charitable giving practices, saying he funneled the funds offshore tax havens. \"The result is that Pritzker's philanthropy, and any accolades that go with it, have been bankrolled with what is essentially found money. He did little to earn the proceeds and paid no taxes on the bulk of it before giving it away,\" the BGA article states.\n\nIn 1993, he married Mary Kathryn \"M. K.\" Muenster of South Dakota, whom he had met in Washington, D.C., when she worked as an aide to U.S. Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota. She is one of three children of Theodore and Karen Muenster. Her father unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in 1990. They live in the Gold Coast neighborhood of Chicago with their two children.\n\nThe \"Chicago Sun-Times\" reported that Pritzker had purposefully directed a mansion that he'd purchased next door to his multimillion-dollar home to become uninhabitable by removing the toilets from the residence. He then appealed his original property tax assessment, claiming that the newly-built residential property was thus \"uninhabitable\"; the Cook County assessor reduced the home's value from $6.25 million to about $1.1 million, which granted Pritzker an 83% property tax reduction, equal to about $230,000 per annum.\n\n"}

He attended the \"Thomasschule zu Leipzig\", a public boarding school in Leipzig. Later he studied law at the University of Leipzig - he was member of the Corps Saxonia Leipzig fraternity. He received a doctorate on the economic use of waterways and shores according to Saxon state law. Later, he established himself as a barrister in Leipzig .\n\nAfter the death of his grandfather E.T. Reichel (1748–1832), Karl Heine bought the shares of Reichel's Garden from another heir, took these pieces of land and from the medial of the 19th century on, he gradually built what is today the inner western suburb of Leipzig.\n\nIn 1854, Heine also expanded his estate in the \"Gemeinde Plagwitz\" district of Leipzig; in 1856, he began the construction of the first section of a navigable canal connecting the rivers Weisse Elster and Saale, which today bears his name (\"Karl-Heine-Kanal\"). The excavation of the canal reclaimed which was later to become the western suburb of Leipzig. To institute his plans for construction and industrialization, Heine established an \"economy\" in Plagwitz.\n\nWhen the western suburb was connected to \"Gemeinde Plagwitz\", Heine constructed the \"Plagwitzer Straße\" (today named \"Käthe-Kollwitz-Straße\"), a street to the south of the old highway from Leipzig to Lindenau, which ran parallel to the new street. Against the opposition of the Leipzig council, he also built the Plagwitz bridge, which connected to the \"Leipziger Straße\" in Plagwitz (today: \"Karl-Heine-Straße\").\n\nKarl Heine was a member of the Saxon Diet from 1870 to his death. He was also a representative in the Leipzig city council.\n\nIn 1874, he moved into his newly built villa in Neuschleußig (Karl-Heine-Villa, \"Könneritzstraße 1\"), where he resided until his death.\n\nIn 1876, a construction scheme was approved which encompassed merging Karl Heine's meadows and fields in the northern part of Schleußig (\"Neuschleußig\") with Bernhard Hüffer's (1824–1904) estate and extensive undeveloped forest land. These areas would be designated as new residential areas. \n\nOn May 24, 1888, Heine founded the \"Westend-Baugesellschaft\", a construction company, to continue his work in developing the Leipzig economy after his death.\n\nSince 1854, Karl Heine had also been a member of the Leipzig masonic lodge \"Apollo\". He died on August 25, 1888, aged 69, in Leipzig.\n\nIn 1897, the city of Leipzig honoured Karl Heine with a monument. The monument was melted down in the Second World War but was renewed in 2001. Many streets and one plaza are named after him. (\"Erdmannstraße\", 1891; \"Karl-Heine-Straße\", 1904; \"Karl-Heine-Platz\", et al.)\n\nIn 2003, a Leipzig vocational school adopted the name of \"Karl-Heine-Schule\".\n\n"}

A leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood, as the Deputy Supreme Guide, el-Shater was the initial candidate of the movement's Freedom and Justice Party during the 2012 Egyptian presidential election before being disqualified by the election commission. Previously, he was the deputy chairman of the Brotherhood.\n\nBorn in Dakahlia, el-Shater joined the youth wing of the ruling Arab Socialist Union party at age 16, during the presidency of Gamal Abdel Nasser. He studied engineering at the Alexandria University. There he participated in the February 1968 student protests against the government. After serving in the military for two years, el-Shater studied for a master's degree and worked as a lecturer at the Mansoura University. After the then president Anwar Sadat's assassination in 1981, el-Shater was exiled as an Islamist dissident, and left for England. After returning in the mid-1980s, he became an active member of the Muslim Brotherhood. In 1995, he became head of the Brotherhood's Greater Cairo branch.\n\nEl-Shater led a successful furniture and textile business with branches in Cairo's luxurious shopping malls, which earned him a fortune of several millions. He is considered a main financier and chief strategist of the Brotherhood. Under the Mubarak regime, he was imprisoned from 2007 until his release by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces in March 2011. Following the victory of the Freedom and Justice Party (parliamentary wing of the Muslim Brotherhood) in the 2011/12 parliamentary election, el-Shater was tipped as a likely candidate for Prime Minister of a coalition government. The Middle East researcher Avi Asher-Schapiro considers el-Shater to be a strong advocate of privatization and free market.\n\nEven though he is the nominal number two in the Brotherhood's hierarchy, some consider him its actual leader. In the eyes of many analysts and activists, he is one of the main reasons behind the anti-revolutionary style of politics the MB followed since the fall of Mubarak. He is also claimed to be responsible for the expulsion of the dissident Brotherhood member Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh and his supporters.\n\nOn 31 March 2012 the Freedom and Justice Party named him their candidate for the presidential election in May. El-Shater formally resigned from the Brotherhood in order to run for president and to avoid violating the Brotherhood's pledge not to field a candidate. The announcement of Shater's presidential candidacy was a historical first for the 83-year-old group, which originally pledged that none of their members would run for president to calm secular and western governments' fears of a complete Islamist takeover by the group. Earlier in 2012, Khairat El-Shater had denied any intentions for entering the presidential race on Al Jazeera, after Ahmed Mansour, host of the show \"Without Limits\" (\"\" ), had subtly questioned the sequence of events which later took place on 31 March 2012. The Egyptian Supreme Council of the Armed Forces barred El-Shater from the presidential race on 14 April 2012, stating that he was only released from prison in March 2011, in violation of election rules stating that a candidate has to be released from prison for 6 years before he can become a candidate.\n\nEl-Shater was arrested on 5 July 2013, following the military coup d'état which unseated the Brotherhood-led government and President Mohamed Morsi. On 14 July 2013 Egypt's military-installed prosecutor general Hisham Barakat ordered his assets to be frozen. On 29 October 2013, a three-judge panel at Cairo Criminal Court stepped down from the proceedings, citing \"uneasiness\" over the trial. On 11 December 2013, a second panel of judges withdrew from the trial. On 28 February 2015, he was sentenced to life in prison. On 16 May 2015, another court issued a preliminary death sentence against him in a separate case. Both verdicts can be appealed.\n"}

Since Kodak did not have its own line of lenses, Kodak digital SLRs have all taken either Canon EOS or Nikon F-mount lenses; most have either been based on Canon or Nikon 135 film SLRs. PixPro has seen its kind of revival, but manufactured by JK Imaging instead of Kodak.\n\nKodak DC260 Pro Edition\nKodak EOS-DCS 1 - converted Canon EOS-1N, released 1997.\n\n\"DC-Series Cameras\" were the earliest consumer digital cameras released. For more details, see Kodak DC Series\n\nEasyShare was Kodak's line of consumer digital cameras compatible with \"docks\" also manufactured by Kodak, simplifying the process of interfacing with computers for editing and printing.\n\nThe DX series cameras were the first EasyShare models released, beginning with the DX3215. It was originally a very basic point and shoot camera series, compatible with the original EasyShare Camera Dock. The CX series eventually replaced the lower-end DX models, and the newer DX-Series models had more advanced features and higher megapixel resolutions and zoom. The DX series is now discontinued. The higher-end of the DX-Series (higher zoom, megapixel) eventually became the Z-Series. Select DX models were the last Kodak consumer digital cameras to use CompactFlash external memory cards.\n\n\nThe CX series is now discontinued, replaced by the C series. The CX series grew out of the DX series. At the time, it was the range of the lowest-priced, most basic point and shoot cameras, typically with no more than a 3× optical zoom.\n\n\nThe LS series was the first EasyShare range to emphasize small form factor, pocket-size cameras. The LS series has now been discontinued. It has been replaced by the V-Series cameras that emphasize small, stylish design with advanced features. Select LS-series models used custom docks.\n\n\nThe C series is the current point-and-shoot series for entry-level digital camera owners, replacing the CX series. CD and CW models are simply derivatives of mainstream C series models.\n\n\nThe Z-Series is the current high-zoom and performance-oriented range of consumer digital cameras, replacing the original DX series.\n\n\nThe V-Series is the current style-oriented range of consumer digital cameras, replacing the original LS series. V-Series had a number of innovations, such as dual-lens technology.\n\n\nThe P-Series was Kodak's performance series which has recently been discontinued in favor of higher-end Z-series models. These were the only consumer models to leverage an external flash (the Kodak P20 Zoom Flash).\n\n\nThe EasyShare-One series were the first consumer Wi-Fi Digital Cameras, that used an SDIO card to automatically upload pictures in wi-fi hotspots. The EasyShare-One series is now discontinued.\n\nThe EasyShare M series are a blend between point-and-shoot cameras (C series) and thin and stylish cameras (V series).

She later remarried. She owns the rights to his name, image, trademarks, and other intellectual property. In 2010, Santiago-Holly co-founded, with Peter Bradley, \"The Buddy Holly Educational Foundation\" also known as TBHEF.\n\nSantiago-Holly (birth name: María Elena Santiago) was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico. María Elena's mother died when she was 12 years old. In 1953, her father sent her to live with her aunt (Provi Garcia) in New York City. Santiago worked as a receptionist for music publisher Peermusic. As a receptionist Maria Elena probably first met Buddy in August 1957 when as rising stars he and the Crickets first visited Peer Southern Music in the Brill Building at 1619 Broadway to meet their publishing manager Murray Deutch who was Maria's boss. Then a day or so before Thursday, June 19, 1958 when he recorded 'Early In The Morning' in New York's Pythian Temple, Buddy asked her out. Santiago had never been out on a date and told Holly he would have to ask her aunt for permission. Holly promptly got her aunt's permission. Five hours into their first date, Buddy handed a rose to Maria and asked her to marry him.\n\nOn August 15, 1958, less than two months later, they were married in Buddy's hometown of Lubbock, Texas. They settled down in Lubbock until Buddy broke up with his band, The Crickets, and they moved to New York. Santiago-Holly went on one tour (October 1958) with her husband and took on promotional duties. Buddy Holly also formed the Maria Music publishing company with which \"Stay Close To Me\" was filed. Holly produced Lou Giordano's version of the song which was issued on Brunswick 55115 on January 27, 1959.\n\nIn the early morning hours of February 3, 1959, Buddy Holly was on tour when he, together with Ritchie Valens and The Big Bopper, died in an airplane crash. Holly and Santiago had been married for only six months at the time of his death. She learned of his death from the reports on television. A widow after only six months of marriage, she suffered a miscarriage shortly after, reportedly due to \"psychological trauma\". Buddy was interred in Lubbock. \n\nSantiago-Holly did not attend the funeral and has never visited the grave site. She told the \"Avalanche-Journal\": \"In a way, I blame myself. I was not feeling well when he left. I was two weeks pregnant, and I wanted Buddy to stay with me, but he had scheduled that tour. It was the only time I wasn't with him. And I blame myself because I know that, if only I had gone along, Buddy never would have gotten into that airplane.\"\n\nFollowing the miscarriage suffered by Santiago-Holly and the circumstances in which she was informed of his death, a policy was later adopted by authorities not to disclose victims' names until after their families have been informed.\n\nSantiago-Holly eventually remarried and had three children. Now divorced, she is a grandmother living in Dallas, Texas, and promotes her first husband's legacy. In 1989, The Smithereens paid honor to her with the song \"Maria Elena\" on their album \"11\". Actress Maria Richwine played Santiago-Holly's role in the 1978 movie \"The Buddy Holly Story\". Jill Hennessy portrayed her in the Broadway production of \"Buddy – The Buddy Holly Story\".\n\nSantiago-Holly has spent most of her life protecting Buddy Holly's legacy. She controversially wanted to charge the city of Lubbock to use Buddy's name in various ways, including in relation to a music festival, a street named the \"Buddy Holly Walk of Fame\", and a terrace named \"Buddy Holly Terrace.\"\n\nIn 2008, Santiago-Holly threatened legal action against Peggy Sue Gerron, the subject of the song \"Peggy Sue\", after the publication of Gerron's autobiography \"Whatever Happened to Peggy Sue?\"\n\nWhile visiting New York City in May 2008, Santiago-Holly visited Washington Square Park, where Holly often played his guitar. She observed musicians singing there, and later told the \"Avalanche-Journal\": She also visited the apartment building where she and Holly had lived. Santiago-Holly remarked it was the first time she had been back to the building since Holly's death.\n\nIn 2010, Santiago-Holly co-founded, with Peter Bradley, the Buddy Holly Educational Foundation. The foundation is a charitable corporation whose mission is to keep Buddy Holly’s legacy alive by providing musical education to new generations regardless of income, ethnicity or educational limitations. Among the areas in the musical education provided are songwriting, production, arranging, orchestration and performance education. The Buddy Holly Educational Foundation co-hosts worldwide songwriting retreats with Chris Difford. They are organized by Peter Bradley Jr, board Director of the Buddy Holly Educational Foundation.\n\n\n"}

New York City is given a baseline score of 100 and other cities are rated in comparison. Important criteria are safety, education, hygiene, health care, culture, environment, recreation, political-economic stability, public transport and access to goods and services. The list is intended to help multinational companies decide where to open offices or plants, and how much to pay employees. For nine consecutive years (2009–2017), Mercer ranked Austria's capital Vienna first in its annual \"Quality of Living\" survey, a title the city still held in 2016.\nSince 2006, the lifestyle magazine \"Monocle\" has published an annual list of livable cities.

Although similar thoughts have been proposed in the early 1970s, oriental management gained traction in the early 1990s having been launched Su Dongshui. The concept is generally based on the unique traditional culture of eastern countries, especially China, and has integrated the essence of management thoughts from both the east and the west, after decades of study. \n\nThe theoretical foundations of oriental management are \"Chinese Management\", \"Western Management,\" and \"Overseas Chinese Management\". It adopted an approach that is people-oriented, with a strong focus on \"human morality,\" and \"human behavior.\" The framework prioritizes learning, ideal behavior, governing, action, and harmony.\n\nAside from serving as a form of management standards for Chinese companies, oriental management can be useful for managers and organizations that encounter specific challenges involving ethics, conflict, and poor performance. Since it incorporates elements of Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism and Western management theories, it is capable of creating a culture of accommodation, transformation, learning, teamwork, and respect for hierarchy, among others. An understanding of oriental management can also provide people interested in doing business in China meaningful insights into the Chinese business practices and norms. \n\nThe research scope of oriental management is not confined to business, but extending to almost all fields of management, including individual governance, management analysis, family governance, business governance and state governance. By exercising and implementing the \"Fifteen philosophical elements\", including rules of governing a state, flexibility against changes, human orientedness, application of power, pragmaticism, regarding harmony as priority, attaching importance on using tools, state governance by law, embarking on a business with credit and good faith, being well planned, stratagem in decision making, subtle using of tactics, being highly efficient and uncorrupted, being industrious in making a fortune, and entelechy with reason, the highest purpose or ultimate value of oriental management is harmonious society in which everybody fulfills his comprehensive and free development.\n"}

The most common goals are minimizing cost and maximizing throughput and/or efficiency. This is one of the major quantitative tools in industrial decision making.\n\nWhen optimizing a process, the goal is to maximize one or more of the process specifications, while keeping all others within their constraints. This can be done by using a process mining tool, discovering the critical activities and bottlenecks, and acting only on them.\n\nFundamentally, there are three parameters that can be adjusted to affect optimal performance. They are:\nThe first step is to verify that the existing equipment is being used to its fullest advantage by examining operating data to identify equipment bottlenecks.\n\nOperating procedures may vary widely from person-to-person or from shift-to-shift. Automation of the plant can help significantly. But automation will be of no help if the operators take control and run the plant in manual.\n\nIn a typical processing plant, such as a chemical plant or oil refinery, there are hundreds or even thousands of control loops. Each control loop is responsible for controlling one part of the process, such as maintaining a temperature, level, or flow.\n\nIf the control loop is not properly designed and tuned, the process runs below its optimum. The process will be more expensive to operate, and equipment will wear out prematurely. For each control loop to run optimally, identification of sensor, valve, and tuning problems is important. It has been well documented that over 35% of control loops typically have problems.\n\nThe process of continuously monitoring and optimizing the entire plant is sometimes called performance supervision.\n\n\n"}

He is the co-founder of Wealth Migrate, a fintech company that offers real estate investments on its online marketplace through crowdfunding. He began offering real estate investment solutions at the age of 26 when he founded International Property Solutions. \"The Huffington Post\" named Wealth Migrate as one of the top 60 real estate crowdfunding solutions in the United States in 2014.\n\nPicken is the author of \"Property Going Global\".\n\nPicken grew up in South Africa, before he moved to London to study. In 1998, Picken wrote his dissertation on how he expected technology to change the way we invest in property. He moved to London to continue his education. Picken graduated in 2001 with a masters degree, also studying the effect of technology on real estate investing.\n\nAfter leaving University, Picken setup International Property Solutions (IPS) at the age of 26. The company assisted people with overseas investments in his native South Africa. During the next few years, Picken helped thousands of people invest in property on four different continents.\n\nDuring an interview, Picken recalled the opportunity to invest in property after the 2008 financial crisis hit. He stated that there were incredible buying opportunities in Wimbledon, London at the time. In order to capitalize on these opportunities, he required £10 million but didn't have the time to raise the funds. He decided that after missing the buying opportunity, he would be interested in creating a vehicle that allowed investors to have quick access to buying power.\n\nFollowing the development of the idea, Picken co-founded Wealth Migrate with Hennie Bezuidenhoudt as his co-founder. The company was launched to assist people to invest in real estate assets, through various partnerships. Picken took the step of using a number of existing partners to launch the crowdfunding platform. Picken was interviewed in the media on a regular basis following the launch of the innovative company. The platform allowed individuals to invest in property around the world.\n\nThe idea was further developed by Picken after he studied the figures behind small investments made in real estate. Using equity companies as an example, they would often invest a small percentage of their funds into real estate. Serious investors would likely use a middleman for these transactions, which would dramatically affect the return on investment. Wealth Migrate's margins were not only lower than traditional charges, but it also made larger projects more accessible to the common real estate investor.\n\nPicken stated in an interview with CNBC that investors could make both residential and commercial investments. Individual investors would normally struggle to invest in larger projects, as they would have to either find the partners themselves or find other ways to raise the full capital amount. Wealth Migrate would allow capital investments as low as $10,000 for investors. The idea was launched in South Africa, before expanding abroad.\n\nAfter five years in operation, Wealth Migrate was selected by The Huffington Post as one of the top United States Real Estate Crowdfunding Platforms. The selection likely came off the back of the growth of the real estate crowdfunding market, which grew to $2.5 billion in transactions in a single year in 2014.\n\nPicken featured in the news during 2015, discussing how he felt crowdfunding would radically change the way real estate transactions take place globally. He raised $4 million in capital for Wealth Migrate for further expansion in the same year. The Wealth Migrate brand expanded its operations to Asia in 2015, under the leadership of Picken.\n\nDuring an interview with CNBC, Picken discussed his investment strategy for Wealth Migrate in the London-area. The commercial real estate opportunity was based on converting abandoned pubs in the United Kingdom into convenience stores. The moves received coverage in the British media, as many supermarket chains used this as a method to open convenience stores in the country in recent years.\n\nPicken suggested in an interview with GQ (magazine) that investments made by his firm are 70% commercial and 30% residential. The platform was developed to give serious investors the opportunity to make alternative commercial investments when compared to more traditional routes.\n\nOne of the major examples that were quoted on CNBC Africa, was the investment made in the medical market. Picken stated that Wealth Migrate invested close to hospitals geographically, which allowed a steady return on the investment. Another example given was the investment and purchasing of commercial property around London, where they would then rent the property to a convenience store company once it had been purchased.\n\nPicken is the author of the book, Property Going Global.\n"}

Drafted under the leadership of the former European Commissioner for the Internal Market Frits Bolkestein, it has been popularly referred to by his name. It was seen as an important kick-start to the Lisbon Agenda which, launched in 2000, was an agreed strategy to make the EU \"the world's most dynamic and competitive economy\" by 2010.\n\nThe Bolkestein Directive was harshly criticised by left-wing European politicians, who stated that it would lead to competition between workers in different parts of Europe — hence the expression \"Polish plumber\" — resulting in social dumping. After the 2004 original draft had been substantially amended, the proposal was approved on 12 December 2006 by the European Parliament and Council, and adopted as the Directive 2006/123/EC.\n\nDevised by the European Commission in March 2004, the first draft of the Services Directive propounded several important changes in the EU services market. Assuming every piece of regulation to be burdensome by default, the Directive required member states to justify all existing legislation on the grounds that it was non-discriminatory, necessary and proportional.\n\nHowever, the changes proposed in the Directive would have not affected the professions, to which the rules of the country where the services are provided would continue to apply under the Directive on the Recognition of Diplomas. Nor, contrary to the popular belief that, for example, a Polish plumber could work in France under Polish labour law), would the changes have affected social legislation or health and safety at work (HSW). In these social fields the Posting-of-Workers Directive requires that short-term social protection, such as minimum wages and HSW, is governed by the rules of the country where the services are provided (the host country), while long-term benefits, such as pension and unemployment benefit contributions, remain with the country of origin (to which the posted workers returns after the service is over).\n\nLegally the Directive did not bring anything into EU law that was not already in the EC Treaty as interpreted by the Court of Justice. The \"country of origin\" principle had been gradually introduced into EU law on the freedom of movement of goods in the Cassis de Dijon case (1979) and into other areas, notably services and establishment, soon after. Secondary legislation cannot introduce rights and obligations that do not already have a basis in the Treaty. In this respect, the original draft of the Services Directive was not a novelty, but a clarification of the case law of the European Court of Justice, and a continuation of the \"country of origin\" principle, which had already been applied in the TV Without Frontiers Directive, the Second Banking Directive, the Third Insurance Directive, the E-Commerce Directive and others.\n\nThe first version of the Bolkestein Directive provoked intense debate and mass protests in various EU countries, including France, Belgium, Sweden and Denmark. On 21 March 2005 nearly 100,000 people marched in Brussels to protest against the Directive. Critics argued that the Directive would erode many of the Member States' regulations governing industry and the environment, and would lead to competition between workers in different parts of Europe, resulting in a decline in income levels. The expression \"Polish plumber\" became famous during the French debate about the Directive, referring to the fear that under the Directive a Polish plumber would be able to work in France under Polish labour laws. Critics also charged that the Directive was a sign that \"Anglo-Saxon\" economic policy was running rampant over the EU and claimed that the Directive would inevitably lead to \"social dumping\" as companies and jobs were relocated to the lower-cost and less regulated economies of eastern Europe. They also claimed, falsely, that the Directive would have an adverse effect on social legislation and HSW (when, as mentioned above, it would have no effect on either).\n\nOn 22 March 2005 EU leaders agreed on a \"far reaching\" revision of the Directive to preserve the European social model. French President Jacques Chirac told an EU summit in Brussels that the changes planned by the Directive were \"unacceptable\". Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg declared: \"If France wishes to eliminate the risk of social dumping, this will be addressed in the framework of the legislative procedure and of co-decision, which has been initiated.\" Modifications to the Directive were introduced at a later stage, in the normal course of the EU legislative process.\n\nOn 1 July 2005 the UK, which was in favour of the Directive, took the chair of the EU Presidency. In Tony Blair's speech to the European Parliament on 23 June he committed the UK Presidency to try to \"resolve some of the hard dossiers,\" of which the Services Directive was one. However, agreement was not achieved during its Presidency.\n\nFrom 14 to 16 February 2006 a plenary session of the European Parliament carried out its first reading of the Directive in Strasbourg. On 16 February 2006 MEPs (Members of the European Parliament) voted 391-213 in favour of a proposed revision to the Directive, although it had already been \"watered down\" from the original version read to the European Parliament on 14 February, so much so that Socialist MEP Evelyne Gebhardt said that the Directive had been \"turned upside down,\" a claim contested by labour organisations. The majority of members of the two largest groupings in the Parliament, the conservative European People's Party (EPP) and the centre-left Party of European Socialists (PES) voted in favour of the revised draft. The Party of the European Left, the European Green Party and the French Socialist Party voted against the new revision. Meanwhile, about 50,000 people demonstrated against the \"country of origin principle\" in Strasbourg.\n\nThe proposed Directive would have covered:\n\nThe following, however, would have been excluded:\n\nThe controversial \"country of origin\" principle was explicitly left out, but there was no \"country of destination\" principle to replace it. The European Court of Justice would therefore be charged with deciding, through its jurisprudence, which country's labour laws would apply in each case.\n\nBusiness groups stated that the new Directive would limit the benefits that the early version of the Directive would have provided.\n\nThe European Commission estimated that this proposed version of the Directive would have created an additional 600,000 jobs in the EU, would have boosted economic growth, and would have increased product quality and choice for consumers.\n\nThe \"Wall Street Journal\" estimated that the revised Directive would have failed in its objective: the liberalisation of services at the heart of the EU.\n\nD. Godefridi of the Hayek Institute wrote in \"le Figaro\": \"Services represent 70% of the European economy. In not liberalising these the EU remains below the objective of the founding treaties of 1957: there is no common European market. For ten years European economic project has moved backwards. On 30 May 2006 the European political elite buried the very essence of the European project\".\n\nLeft-wing and labour organisations maintained that the new version of the Directive was not as favourable to workers as it was made out to be. There was also concern that the \"country of origin\" principle would most likely still be applied by the European Court of Justice, as previous jurisprudence seemed to suggest. In particular, it was pointed out that member states would be prohibited from applying any kind of restricted authorisation to businesses in the fields covered by the Directive, which would, they claimed, make administration of labour laws close to impossible.\n\nOn 5 April 2006 the European Commission presented a new version of the Directive to the Council of Ministers, including most of the modifications voted by the MEPs, in accordance with the codecision procedure. On 29 May 2006 the Council approved the revised text, which subsequently was resubmitted to the Parliament for its second and final reading.\n\nThe Directive, after being substantially amended from the original proposal, was adopted on 12 December 2006 by the Council and the European Parliament, and published on the Official Journal of the European Union on 27 December 2006 as the Directive 2006/123/EC. Therefore, the Directive on services in the internal market should have been completely implemented by the Member States by 28 December 2009.\n\nAlthough the final version did not include the \"country of origin\" principle, the Directive instead reminded Member States of the principle of free movement, while accepting inroads when free movement collides with other public interests. However, before making such inroads, authorities have to verify and recognize any protection already provided in the country of origin - under the mutual recognition principle, they need to take into account what takes place in other countries before proceeding.\n\nThe Services Directive, which came into force on 28 December 2009, requires all EU Member States to establish web portals so that anyone who provides a service will have a \"point of single contact\" where they can find out what legal requirements they need to meet to operate in the country in question. Service providers can also use the web portals to apply for any licence or permit they need.\n\nThe Directive should make it easier for EU service providers to operate in any other EU Member State. The UK's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (Services Directive implementation team), working with marketing consultants, created the EUGO brand for use on point-of-single-contact portals across Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "668326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=668326", "title": "Sole proprietorship", "text": "Sole proprietorship\n\nA sole proprietorship, also known as the sole trader, individual entrepreneurship or proprietorship, is a type of enterprise that is owned and run by one person and in which there is no legal distinction between the owner and the business entity. The owner is in direct control of all elements and is legally accountable for the finances of such business and this may include debts, loans, loss, etc. A sole trader does not necessarily work 'alone'—it is possible for the sole trader to employ other people.\n\nThe sole trader receives all profits (subject to taxation specific to the business) and has unlimited responsibility for all losses and debts. Every asset of the business is owned by the proprietor and all debts of the business are the proprietor's. It is a \"sole\" proprietorship in contrast with partnerships (which have at least two owners).\n\nA sole proprietor may use a trade name or business name other than their or its legal name. They may have to legally trademark their business name if it differs from their own legal name, the process varying depending upon country of residence.\n\nRegistration of a business name for a sole proprietor is generally uncomplicated unless it involves the selection of a name that is fictitious, or “assumed”. The business owner is required to register with the appropriate local authorities, who will determine that the name submitted is not duplicated by another business entity. Furthermore, the business owner must complete a form submitted to the governing authority to acquire title as a “DBA” or \"doing business as”. The authority in some US states is the Secretary of State.\n\nThe license for a sole proprietary business entitles the owner to hire employees and enlist the services of independent consultants. Although an employee or consultant may be requested by the owner to complete a specific project or participate in the company's decision-making process, their contribution to the project or decision is considered a \"recommendation\" under the law. Under the legal doctrine \"Respondeat superior\" (Latin: \"let the master answer\"), the legal liability for any business decision arising from such a contribution remains upon the owner and cannot be renounced or apportioned.\n\nThis is transposed by the unlimited liability attached to a sole proprietary business. The owner carries the financial responsibility for all debts and/or losses suffered by the business, to the extent of using personal or other assets, to discharge any outstanding liabilities. The owner is exclusively liable for all business activities conducted by the sole proprietorship and accordingly, entitled to full control and all earnings associated with it. The general aspect according to the general business law is that this type of business owner does not embody a “legal entity” Furthermore, any attempted and unreliable distinctions of the business do not change the classification under this title.\n\nIn Ireland, a sole trader who wishes to use a business name must register that name with the Companies Registration Office (CRO).\n\nIn Malaysia, there are three different laws governing the registration and administration of sole proprietors:-\nIn West Malaysia, the registration of sole proprietors come under the purview of the Companies Commission of Malaysia (\"Suruhanjaya Syarikat Malaysia\", or abbreviated as \"SSM\"). In Sabah and Sarawak (with the exception of Kuching), the registration of businesses are done at the local authorities (e.g. municipal councils or district offices) while in Kuching, sole proprietors are registered with the Kuching Office of the Malaysian Inland Revenue Board.\n\nSole proprietors, which includes the self-employed, must register with the relevant authority within thirty (30) days from the commencement of their business. Sole proprietors may register their business using one of two names: (1) their legal name following the registrant's identity card or (2) a trade name. Registration of a business lasts either one or two years, and must be renewed thirty (30) days before its expiry. \n\nIn the event of termination of business, the proprietor has thirty (30) days from the termination date to file the notice with the relevant authority. If the termination is caused by the death of the proprietor, the administrators of the estate has four (4) months from the death date to file a notice of termination.\n\nSole proprietors must register with the Royal Malaysian Customs Department to charge and collect goods and services tax (GST) once their taxable turnover within a 12 month-period exceeds RM500,000.\n\nSimilar to other Common Law jurisdiction, proprietors may enter into contracts of employment and/or apprenticeship with their employees. Sole proprietors, as employers, are responsible to:-\n\nIn 2016, the SSM took legal action against 478 online businesses who fail to register their businesses whether as sole proprietors, partnerships, or private limited companies. As at May 12 2017, a total of 50,882 online businesses have registered with the SSM since 2015.\n\nA sole trader is the simplest type of business structure defined in UK law. It refers to an individual who owns their own business and retains all the profits from it. When starting up, sole traders must complete a straightforward registration with HM Revenue and Customs as self-employed for tax and National Insurance purposes. They are responsible for maintaining the businesses records and submitting an annual Tax return for all income from self-employment and other work.\n\nIn Britain, anyone who begins work for themselves is considered by the Government to be a self-employed sole trader, regardless of whether or not they have advised HM Revenue and Customs. A sole trader can keep all the profits of their business after tax has been paid. They must lodge a self-assessment tax return each year, and pay Income Tax as well as National Insurance. If revenue is expected to be more than £83,000 a year, they must also register for the Value Added Tax. A sole trader can employ staff, but is personally responsible for any losses the business makes.\n\nBecoming a sole trader is relatively simple compared to other business structures. It can rapidly enable a business to begin trading; the requirements for record keeping are far more straightforward than other business structures. Sole traders make all operational decisions and are solely responsible for raising business finance. They can invest their own capital into the business, or may be able to access business loans and/or overdrafts. Unlike limited companies or partnerships, it is not necessary to share decision making or the profits.\n\nThe simplicity of this structure also has its limitations. Unlike forming a limited company, it lacks the clear cut definition between personal and business income from the perspective of the tax authorities. The business owner is personally liable for income tax and National Insurance contributions due for the business profits in each given tax year. They are also personally liable for any debts the business incurs. Business analysts may advise sole traders to form a limited company in order to access greater levels of financing, for example for expansion plans. This can limit their personal liability; business lenders may be more inclined to co-operate with a limited company. It can also be the case that within certain industries it is easier to secure work if presenting potential business partners with a limited company structure.\n\nIn the United States there are no formalities that must be followed to start a sole proprietorship or commence business as a sole proprietor. However, depending upon the business activity of the sole proprietorship, sole proprietors may require licenses and permits in order to conduct business.\n\nAccording to the Small Business Administration (SBA) a sole proprietor and their business are considered as one and the same; therefore, the business is not subjected to separate taxation and regarded as the direct income of the owner. Income, losses and expenses may be listed on a Schedule C, which is then transferred to the personal tax return of the owner. It is the responsibility of the owner to ensure all due income taxes and self-employment contributions are paid.\n\nA permitted exception to the sole proprietor (single owner) stipulation is made by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) permitting the spouse of a sole proprietor to work for the business. They are not classified as partners in the enterprise, or an independent contractor, enabling the business to retain its sole proprietorship status and not be required to submit a partnership income tax return.\n\nThe setting-up process of a sole proprietorship to comply with local laws and regulations, is obtainable from the Small Business Development Center (SBDC), using their locator facility. A sole proprietor must be prepared to devote their time, utilizing business methods towards establishing a sound and appropriate foundation. Doing so may contribute to increased turnover, profits, minimize taxes, and avoid other potential adversities. \n\nSole owners are engaged in many varieties of industry and commerce and a comprehensive list of the primary categories, is found in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The selection of a business type by a new sole proprietor is in many instances, motivated by appropriate business experience in a particular field, especially those pertaining to enterprises involving the marketing and selling of defined products and services.\n\nA crucial component of a sole proprietorship within a business plan is the provision of an inherent guideline, for actions that require implementing for a business to achieve growth. The business name and products are critical aspects in the founding of a sole proprietorship and once selected, should be protected. In the event of a determined brand name being legalized, information regarding trademark protection is available from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nFor the sole proprietor there are a variety of options in obtaining financial support for their business, including loan facilities available from the U.S. Small Business Administration. The loans are not originated by the SBA, but the administration does guarantee loans made by various independent lending institutions. The primary loan facility for small businesses offered by this agency is the 7(a) loan program, designed for general applications. Sole proprietors are able to finance legitimate operating expenses; for example, working capital, furniture, leasehold improvements and building renovations.\n\nMany and varied private organizations and individuals seek opportunities to invest and fund a business that may not qualify for traditional financing from institutions, such as banks. For the sole proprietor, seeking to take advantage of this facility, there are various factors that must be understood and adhered to regarding the loan application.\n\nThe Small Business Administration (SBA) advises there are traditionally two forms of financing: debt and equity. For any small business owner seeking funding, they must consider the debt-to-equity ratio of their enterprise. This means the inter-action between the sum of dollars borrowed and the financial dollars invested in the business. The mathematics are simple; greater the finance invested by sole proprietors in their business; easier the obtaining of finance! The SBA statistics show that the majority of small enterprises favor the use of limited equity financing; for example, friends and relatives.\n\nAccording to the SBA, there are various private organizations prepared to fund sole proprietor business operations that do not qualify for traditional financing from banks. These private investors can provide loans, credit lines, leasing facilities for equipment, or other forms of capital, to sole proprietorship that have exhausted alternative financial resources. It is also possible for these owners to obtain financing by way of business partners or others, with cash to invest. Financial partners are frequently “silent” and although they do not participate in any business related decisions, they generally receive a percentage of the profits, generated by the business.\n\nTo assist sole proprietors, there are business grants available from the Federal Government or private organizations, providing certain criteria are met. To qualify for Federal grants, small businesses must comply with determined business size and income standards. For consideration regarding various grant opportunities, sole proprietors may apply for a grant in their capacity as an individual. Local governments and state economic development agencies, frequently make grants available, for businesses that stimulate their local economies.\n\nFor any sole proprietor applying for a loan, before starting the loan procedure, it is essential their personal and business credit history is in order and up-to-date. A personal credit report should be obtained from a credit bureau; for example, Trans-Union, Equifax or Experian. This action should be initiated by a business owner well before starting the borrowing process.\n\nThe Small Business Administration specifies that all credit reports received from any source should be carefully reviewed to ensure that all relevant personal information is correct. Other content in the report should also be examined particularly that related to the past credit obtained, from sources such as, credit cards, mortgages, student loans, as well as details pertaining to how the credit was repaid.\n\nAn exact translation of \"sole proprietorship\" is unusual, because the focus of the concept can change. An example is the Brazilian concept of \"sole business\" that was split into two main kinds of formal freelancer:\n\nGerman and Austrian tax laws also differentiate between sole professionals and other sole proprietors.\n\n"}

He was a son of Henry Foulis of Colinton and Margaret Haldane. As a financier to the mint and crown his business partner was Robert Joussie, or Jowsie (d. 1610), an Edinburgh cloth merchant who later became Groom of the Chamber.\n\nFoulis was made a master of the Edinburgh Incorporation of Goldsmiths and burgess on 18 June 1581 after submitting an essay of silverwork. His master had been Michael Gilbert. A son David followed him into the craft. In February 1581/2 he made new dies for minting coins, following the designs of Lord Seton's painter.\n\nJames VI sent Foulis and Joussie to London in July 1589 to buy clothes and ornaments for his marriage to Anne of Denmark. James gave him a pleadge of two cut rubies and three cabochon rubies set in gold \"chattons\" or buttons from the crown jewels for these purchases and new work. Foulis supplied jewels to James VI and Anne, while Joussie supplied clothes and fabrics (Foulis also had a stock of fabric at his death). In 1590 he made a silver-gilt and engraved basin and ewer for Queen Elizabeth's christening gift to Elizabeth Stewart, the daughter of Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell, and advanced the English ambassador Robert Bowes £20 sterling to reward the servants and musicians.\n\nIn April 1594 he received a grant to prospect and mine for gold, silver, lead, tin and other metals, in Lanarkshire. He became known as Thomas Foulis of Leadhills.\n\nFoulis became involved in the administration of the Scottish exchequer by the group knowns as the Octavians. They gave him a role on 29 December 1597 overseeing royal expenditure. However, Foulis was bankrupted by the scheme on 17 January 1598. Roger Aston wrote that Foulis was treasurer in all but name and after twenty days \"fell by his wits\" and lay \"in great extremity\". David Calderwood called his distress a frenzy, \"phrenesie\". He recovered and on 2 August 1598 Foulis and Joussie obtained a contract (a tack) to operate the mint for six years in recompense of their losses.\n\nJames Hudson wrote in May 1598 that Foulis was involved in pawning a gold lion set with a ruby worth £400 in London, which he suggested belonged to James VI.\n\nIn 1613 Foulis had the contract for a silvermine at Hilderston near Linlithgow. He died in Edinburgh in 1628.\n\nFoulis married firstly Jean Francis, who died in 1623, then Rachel Porteous.
