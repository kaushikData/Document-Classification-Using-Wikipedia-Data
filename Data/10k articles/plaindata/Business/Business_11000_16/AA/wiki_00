Industrial parks are usually located close to transport facilities, especially where more than one transport modalities coincide. Sk Hwy 16, the Yellowhead, Sk Hwy 11, and Sk Hwy 11 are all accessed directly from Agriplace. The Saskatoon John G. Diefenbaker International Airport is southwest of the Sk Hwy 16, the Yellowhead highway.\n\nThe land was annexed from the rural municipality of Corman Park between 1980 and 1984. The agriplace subdivision is nestled between three major trucking routes. Sk Hwy 16, the Yellowhead departs Saskatoon to North Battleford to the north west. Sk Hwy 11 to Prince Albert via Warman, and Sk Hwy 12 to Blaine Lake via Martensville mark the eastern boundary. 71st Street is the northern perimeter of the industrial park.\n\nFirst laid out in the early 1980s, Agriplace became well known to Saskatonians through the decision to replace the original downtown Saskatoon Arena with a new indoor arena facility. Three major locations were considered: on the site of a decommissioned power plant just west of the original Arena location (lands now part of River Landing), a site in the North Industrial district east of Idylwyld Drive, and a site in the south portion of the yet-to-be-developed Agriplace. Ultimately, Agriplace was chosen for the location of Saskatchewan Place (later renamed Credit Union Centre), an initially controversial decision due to Agriplace's remote location relative to the rest of the city and the fact accessing the area requires driving on freeways (it was not until the extension of Marquis Drive in the early 2010s that motorists from Saskatoon were given a non-freeway/non-service road option for accessing the area).\n\nAt one point the City of Saskatoon also pursued plans to relocate the city's exhibition grounds onto lands adjacent to the new arena and north of 60th Street West, but public opposition and lack of space led to this plan being dropped by the late 1980s.\n\nAgriplace also received some additional notoriety when it first appeared on City maps. One of the area's major streets carries the name \"Thatcher Avenue\"; it appeared on maps the same year former MLA Colin Thatcher was on trial for murder, a sensational case that attracted international attention. In this case, however, the street wasn't named for Thatcher nor his father, former Saskatchewan Premier Ross Thatcher, but rather for a species of wheat, in keeping with the general naming conventions in the area.\n\nIn 2003, Saunders Avenue, one of the access roads into Credit Union Centre, was renamed Bill Hunter Avenue in honor of the hockey manager and promoter who attempted to get the St. Louis Blues National Hockey League team transferred to Saskatoon in the 1980s. The renaming was noted with irony as Hunter opposed the Agriplace location of the arena.\n\nThe agriplace industrial park is a mix of commercial and industrial concerns. Costco, a members only bulk grocery and department store, is a major employer in the agriplace district. Sasktel Centre formerly named Credit Union Centre, and Saskatchewan Place is a 12000-seat arena hosting sporting, concert and large events to Saskatoon. Canlan Ice Sports Agriplace Centre is located on Apex Street. The Husky truck stop has relocated from Circle Drive to Agriplace. Motel 6 an Tim Hortons have opened near the Husky.\n\nIn the Agriplace subdivision are located 48 sectors giving employment to 780 full-time employees and 221 part-time employees.\n\n"}

Subsequently, Constitutional Amendment number 19 relaxed this requirement by establishing the possibility of adopting the statutory regime or Hired Under Employment Laws, but was reinstated after the foregoing assessment of ADIn 2135.\nThe regulation of the legal regime of civil servants federal government, local and federal public foundations is carried out in Brazil under Federal Law no. 8.112/1990. Are not included in the legal regime established by this Act that federal employees are governed by the dictates of the Consolidation of Labor Laws and Federal Law no. 9.962/2000.\nIt should be understood that under the Federal Constitution of 1988, both regimes must respect constitutionally established rules, for example, all accepted by the public employer shall be subject to a tender or selection process.\n\nThus, in Brazil so-called statutory servants (connected to the system of Federal Law no. 8112) and servants called \"celetistas\", which obey the Consolidation of Labor Laws.\nHowever, in order to grant interim with \"ex nunc\" effect on the date of August 2, 2007 ADIn in 2135, which suspended the effectiveness of EC 19 in that it modifies the chapeau of Article 39 for violation of the CF/1988 Article 60, II, of CF/1988 (vice-initiative), the Legal One has been restored.\n\nThe term \"civil servant\" and \"tenured servant\" appear in the Constitution of Brazil. Article 41 of the Federal Constitution states that \"Servants who, by virtue of public entrance examinations, are appointed to effective posts, acquire tenure after three years of actual service.\"\n\nCivil servants are listed as a category of public servants: they are permanent staff, professionals in the service of public administration. The Brazilian Penal Code, however, refers to a public official, which has a broader scope than the public servant. A board member, for example, who exercises a public function (help in the electoral process), is a civilian employee (in respect of acts performed as a board member), despite a transient and unpaid public role.\n\nFilling is the administrative act of filling public office in Brazil regulated by Law No. 8112 of November 11, 1990 [1].\nUnder the legislation, the provision may be given by appointment, promotion, rehabilitation, recovery, recovery, reintegration and renewal.Each of these forms of provision has a special significance in public administration and specify the legal form of access to public office in Brazil.\n\nThe fee payment for services rendered to the state civil servant is given as follows:\nEarning. \nCF/88 Article 39 § 4: The State of Power, the holder of an elective office, Ministers of State and Municipal and State Secretaries shall be paid exclusively by fixed allowance in a lump sum, sealed the addition of any bonus, additional allowance, award, grant or other type of representation remuneration, obeyed in any case the provisions of art. 37, X and X\nAny salary within the public service may exceed the value of allowances paid to Justices of the Supreme Court (STF) and the salaries of the offices of the Legislative and the Judiciary can not be higher than those paid by the executive. Despite these rules exist, many people are wondering if they are indeed obeyed.\n\n"}
{"id": "168387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=168387", "title": "Business intelligence", "text": "Business intelligence\n\nBusiness intelligence (BI) comprises the strategies and technologies used by enterprises for the data analysis of business information. BI technologies provide historical, current and predictive views of business operations. Common functions of business intelligence technologies include reporting, online analytical processing, analytics, data mining, process mining, complex event processing, business performance management, benchmarking, text mining, predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics. BI technologies can handle large amounts of structured and sometimes unstructured data to help identify, develop and otherwise create new strategic business opportunities. They aim to allow for the easy interpretation of these big data. Identifying new opportunities and implementing an effective strategy based on insights can provide businesses with a competitive market advantage and long-term stability.\n\nBusiness intelligence can be used by enterprises to support a wide range of business decisions ranging from operational to strategic. Basic operating decisions include product positioning or pricing. Strategic business decisions involve priorities, goals and directions at the broadest level. In all cases, BI is most effective when it combines data derived from the market in which a company operates (external data) with data from company sources internal to the business such as financial and operations data (internal data). When combined, external and internal data can provide a complete picture which, in effect, creates an \"intelligence\" that cannot be derived from any singular set of data. Amongst myriad uses, business intelligence tools empower organizations to gain insight into new markets, to assess demand and suitability of products and services for different market segments and to gauge the impact of marketing efforts.\n\nOften BI applications use data gathered from a data warehouse (DW) or from a data mart, and the concepts of BI and DW combine as \"BI/DW\"\nor as \"BIDW\". A data warehouse contains a copy of analytical data that facilitate decision support.\n\nThe earliest known use of the term \"business intelligence\" is in Richard Millar Devens' \"Cyclopædia of Commercial and Business Anecdotes\" (1865). Devens used the term to describe how the banker Sir Henry Furnese gained profit by receiving and acting upon information about his environment, prior to his competitors:\nThe ability to collect and react accordingly based on the information retrieved, Devens says, is central to business intelligence.\n\nWhen Hans Peter Luhn, a researcher at IBM, used the term \"business intelligence\" in an article published in 1958, he employed the \"Webster's Dictionary\" definition of intelligence: \"the ability to apprehend the interrelationships of presented facts in such a way as to guide action towards a desired goal.\" Business intelligence as it is understood today is said to have evolved from the decision support systems (DSS) that began in the 1960s and developed throughout the mid-1980s. DSS originated in the computer-aided models created to assist with decision making and planning.\n\nIn 1989, Howard Dresner (later a Gartner analyst) proposed \"business intelligence\" as an umbrella term to describe \"concepts and methods to improve business decision making by using fact-based support systems.\" It was not until the late 1990s that this usage was widespread.\n\nCritics see BI merely as an evolution of business reporting together with the advent of increasingly powerful and easy-to-use data analysis tools. In this respect it has also been criticized as a marketing buzzword in the context of the \"big data\" surge.\n\nAccording to Forrester Research, business intelligence is \"a set of methodologies, processes, architectures, and technologies that transform raw data into meaningful and useful information used to enable more effective strategic, tactical, and operational insights and decision-making.\" Under this definition, business intelligence encompasses information management (data integration, data quality, data warehousing, master-data management, text- and content-analytics, et al.). Therefore, Forrester refers to \"data preparation\" and \"data usage\" as two separate but closely linked segments of the business-intelligence architectural stack.\n\nSome elements of business intelligence are:\n\n\nForrester distinguishes this from the \"business-intelligence market\", which is \"just the top layers of the BI architectural stack, such as reporting, analytics, and dashboards.\"\n\nThough the term business intelligence is sometimes a synonym for competitive intelligence (because they both support decision making), BI uses technologies, processes, and applications to analyze mostly internal, structured data and business processes while competitive intelligence gathers, analyzes and disseminates information with a topical focus on company competitors. If understood broadly, business intelligence can include the subset of competitive intelligence.\n\nBusiness intelligence and business analytics are sometimes used interchangeably, but there are alternate definitions. Thomas Davenport, professor of information technology and management at Babson College argues that business intelligence should be divided into querying, reporting, Online analytical processing (OLAP), an \"alerts\" tool, and business analytics. In this definition, business analytics is the subset of BI focusing on statistics, prediction, and optimization, rather than the reporting functionality.\n\nThe Business Intelligence landscape reflects the complex system which data goes through in order to get processed into information. One of the first steps of starting a BI program, is to understand all components of this landscape. The particularities of this system tend to differ based on the industry and organization, but at a macro level, all BI landscapes have the same format. It’s usually composed of five pillars and five foundation blocks:\n\nThe five pillars:\n\n\nThe five foundation blocks:\n\n\nBusiness operations can generate a very large amount of information in the form of e-mails, memos, notes from call-centers, news, user groups, chats, reports, web-pages, presentations, image-files, video-files, and marketing material. According to Merrill Lynch, more than 85% of all business information exists in these forms; a company might only use such a document a single time. Because of the way it is produced and stored, this information is either unstructured or semi-structured.\n\nThe management of semi-structured data is an unsolved problem in the information technology industry. According to projections from Gartner (2003), white collar workers spend 30–40% of their time searching, finding, and assessing unstructured data. BI uses both structured and unstructured data. The former is easy to search, and the latter contains a large quantity of the information needed for analysis and decision making. Because of the difficulty of properly searching, finding and assessing unstructured or semi-structured data, organizations may not draw upon these vast reservoirs of information, which could influence a particular decision, task or project. This can ultimately lead to poorly informed decision making.\n\nTherefore, when designing a business intelligence/DW-solution, the specific problems associated with semi-structured and unstructured data must be accommodated for as well as those for the structured data.\n\nUnstructured and semi-structured data have different meanings depending on their context. In the context of relational database systems, unstructured data cannot be stored in predictably ordered columns and rows. One type of unstructured data is typically stored in a BLOB (binary large object), a catch-all data type available in most relational database management systems. Unstructured data may also refer to irregularly or randomly repeated (nonrepetitive) column patterns that vary from row to row within each file or document.\n\nMany of these data types, however, like e-mails, word processing text files, PPTs, image-files, and video-files conform to a standard that offers the possibility of metadata. Metadata can include information such as author and time of creation, and this can be stored in a relational database.\nTherefore, it may be more accurate to talk about this as semi-structured documents or data, but no specific consensus seems to have been reached.\n\nUnstructured data can also simply be the knowledge that business users have about future business trends. Business forecasting naturally aligns with the BI system because business users think of their business in aggregate terms. Capturing the business knowledge that may only exist in the minds of business users provides some of the most important data points for a complete BI solution.\n\nThere are several challenges to developing BI with semi-structured data. According to Inmon & Nesavich, some of those are:\n\n\nTo solve problems with searchability and assessment of data, it is necessary to know something about the content. This can be done by adding context through the use of metadata. Many systems already capture some metadata (e.g. filename, author, size, etc.), but more useful would be metadata about the actual content – e.g. summaries, topics, people or companies mentioned. Two technologies designed for generating metadata about content are automatic categorization and information extraction.\n\nBusiness intelligence can be applied to the following business purposes:\n\n\nIn a 2013 report, Gartner categorized business intelligence vendors as either an independent \"pure-play\" vendor or a consolidated \"megavendor\". In 2012 business intelligence services received $13.1 billion in revenue.\n\nA 2009 paper predicted these developments in the business intelligence market:\n\n\nA 2009 \"Information Management\" special report predicted the top BI trends: \"green computing, social networking services, data visualization, mobile BI, predictive analytics, composite applications, cloud computing and multitouch\". Research undertaken in 2014 indicated that employees are more likely to have access to, and more likely to engage with, cloud-based BI tools than traditional tools.\n\nOther business intelligence trends include the following:\n\nOther lines of research include the combined study of business intelligence and uncertain data. In this context, the data used is not assumed to be precise, accurate and complete. Instead, data is considered uncertain and therefore this uncertainty is propagated to the results produced by BI.\n\nAccording to a study by the Aberdeen Group, there has been increasing interest in Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business intelligence over the past years, with twice as many organizations using this deployment approach as one year ago – 15% in 2009 compared to 7% in 2008.\n\nAn article by InfoWorld's Chris Kanaracus points out similar growth data from research firm IDC, which predicts the SaaS BI market will grow 22 percent each year through 2013 thanks to increased product sophistication, strained IT budgets, and other factors.\n\nAn analysis of top 100 Business Intelligence and Analytics scores and ranks the firms based on several open variables\n\n"}

With the arrival of British and French coastal settlements, the Beothuk were forced inland, and the lack of their normal food source contributed to a decrease in the Beothuk population. Beothuk numbers began to dwindle rapidly due to a combination of factors directly relating to European, Inuit and Mi'kmaq migration, and by the 19th Century, the tribe no longer existed.\n\nAfter his voyage in 1497, John Cabot's crew reported that \n\nthe sea there is full of fish that can be taken not only with nets but with fishing-baskets.\n\nand around 1600 English fishing captains still reported cod shoals \n\nso thick by the shore that we hardly have been able to row a boat through them.\n\nIn the early sixteenth century, fishermen from England, France, Spain and Portugal discovered the best places to fish for cod in the waters off Newfoundland, and how best to preserve the fish for the journey home.\n\nThe French, Spanish and Portuguese fishermen tended to fish on the Grand Banks and other banks out to sea, where fish were always available. They salted their fish on board ship and it was not dried until brought to Europe. The English fishermen, however, concentrated on fishing inshore where the fish were only to be found at certain times of the year, during their migrations. These fishermen used small boats and returned to shore every day. They developed a system of light salting, washing and drying onshore which became very popular because the fish could remain edible for years. Many of their coastal sites gradually developed into settlements, notably St. John's, now the provincial capital.\n\nIn the late sixteenth century the Spanish and Portuguese fisheries were terminated, mainly as a result of the failure of the Spanish Armada, and thereafter the English and French shared the fishery every summer until 1904 when the French agreed to relinquish it to the Newfoundland residents.\n\nIn 1951 factory fishing began with new super-trawlers such as the 'Fairtry'; 280 feet long and 2,600 gross tons.\n\nThe cod catch peaked in 1968 at 810,000 tons, approximately three times more than the maximum yearly catch achieved before the super-trawlers. Approximately 8 million tons of cod were caught between 1647 and 1750, a period encompassing 25 to 40 cod generations. The factory trawlers took the same amount in 15 years.\n\nThe industry collapsed entirely in the early 1990s owing to overfishing and debatably, greed, lack of foresight and poor local administration. By 1993 six cod populations had collapsed, forcing a belated moratorium on fishing. Spawning biomass had decreased by at least 75% in all stocks, by 90% in three of the six stocks, and by 99% in the case of 'northern' cod, previously the largest cod fishery in the world.\n\nAfter a 10-year moratorium on fishing begun in 1992, the cod had still not returned. It was thought that the local ecosystem might have changed, one possibility being that greater numbers of capelin, which used to provide food for the cod, might be eating the juvenile cod. The waters appeared to be dominated by crab and shrimp rather than fish. However, by 2011 it became apparent that the fisheries were returning to their original abundance, just more slowly than had been anticipated.\n\nThe \"Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement\" (CETA) between Canada and the European Union is a Free Trade Agreement which is still under negotiation as of May 2015. The provincial government has argued that the Federal government of Canada in Ottawa reneged on a deal to pay $280 million in exchange for its relinquishment of minimum processing requirements as part of CETA. Those rules helped protect jobs in fish plants, especially in rural areas hit hard by the cod moratorium since 1992.\n\n\n\n"}

He was Depute Leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) from 1971 to 1973 and from 1979 to 1981. He served as a Scottish National Party Member of Parliament (MP) for East Aberdeenshire from 1974 to 1979, and held virtually every national office in the SNP, short of party leader. His political style has been described as \"no-nonsense\" and \"very blunt and forthright\". He was also known for his forceful public speaking, which former SNP leader Alex Salmond described as \"messianic\".\n\nHenderson was born in Edinburgh, the son of a railway porter. He won a scholarship to attend the Royal High School and was then awarded a bursary which allowed him to attend the University of Edinburgh from 1952 to 1957. He graduated from Edinburgh with an MA and an LLB.\n\nHe worked as a management consultant in the UK and overseas. He married Maureen Ferguson in Johannesburg in 1960 and had four children, but they were later divorced. In later life, his home and business partner was English fashion designer Betty Davies; together, they founded Scottish Fashion International.\n\nIn later years, he regularly attended St Giles Cathedral, where his funeral was held on 7 October 2006.\n\nHenderson became a supporter of Scottish independence at an early age, and joined the SNP aged 14. He was President of the Edinburgh University Nationalist Club. Henderson became heavily involved with the SNP after he returned to Scotland from South Africa in the mid-1960s. He was also the director of programmes for Radio Free Scotland from 1963 to 1965, and was Senior vice-chairman (depute leader) of the SNP from 1970 to 1972. He was selected as the SNP candidate for East Aberdeenshire in 1972, and moved to live in the constituency, developing links with local fishermen, farmers and businessmen. He was elected at the February 1974 general election, and re-elected in the October general election later that year. The SNP were in the ascendent, campaigning on the basis of \"It's Scotland's oil\".\n\nHenderson served as the whip and was a leading member of the group of 11 SNP MPs in the House of Commons. In 1975, he negotiated a position for the SNP's Winnie Ewing in the British delegation to the European Parliament, where she became known as \"Madame Ecosse\". He was later the SNP spokesman on employment and industry. He was instrumental in the SNP's decision to lay down a censure motion in the House of Commons, criticising the Labour government of James Callaghan after 1 March 1979 referendum vote on Scottish devolution failed to be approved by the required 40% of the electorate. At the time, the Labour government were reliant upon support from the SNP. The motion was carried by one vote on 28 March and Callaghan immediately called the general election which brought the Conservative Party led by Margaret Thatcher to power. Callaghan described the actions of the SNP as \"turkeys voting for Christmas\". Henderson lost his seat to Conservative Albert McQuarrie in the 1979 general election by less than 600 votes, and only two MPs from the SNP remained in the new Parliament.\n\nHe returned to his business career, but with less success than the 1960s. At the SNP Conference in 1979, he was elected the party's Senior vice-chairman (now described as deputy leader) (to leader Gordon Wilson), defeating Margo MacDonald for the post. He remained in this position until 1981, when he stood down on health grounds.\n\nHe fought the new seat of Banff and Buchan, which had largely replaced Aberdeenshire East in the 1983 general election, again losing to Albert McQuarrie by less than 1,000 votes. Future SNP leader Alex Salmond would represent this constituency from 1987, and it has since become a somewhat safe SNP seat with four-figure majorities over the Conservative and Unionist Party. He also suffered in his private life, being divorced in the early 1980s.\n\nHe was out of active politics for a long period as a result of misdiagnosed illness. He had a major operation in 1998 for cancer, and then several months of chemotherapy, before he was able to resume his political duties for the SNP.\n\nHe contested the 2004 European Parliament election for the SNP but was not elected as he was placed fourth on the party's list and they gained only two seats. He also contested the Dumfries and Galloway seat at the 2005 general election, finishing third behind Russell Brown, the Labour candidate and Peter Duncan the Conservative candidate.\n\nIn September 2005, following the retirement of Winnie Ewing, he stood for the post of SNP President, polling 129 votes (30.00%) compared to 235 votes (54.65%) for Ian Hudghton, Member of the European Parliament, and 66 votes (15.35%) for onetime president William Wolfe. He was however successful in being elected as one of six ordinary members of the SNP's National Executive Committee.\n\nHe was selected to fight the Falkirk East constituency for the Scottish Parliament election, 2007, and was ranked fourth on the SNP's Central Scotland regional list. He died after a short illness in 2006, before the election could take place.\n"}

He is best known for directing the science fiction film \"Moon\" (2009), for which he won the BAFTA Award for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer. He has also directed \"Source Code\" (2011), \"Warcraft\" (2016) and \"Mute\" (2018).\n\nDuncan Zowie Jones was born in Bromley, London, on 30 May 1971, the only child of English singer-songwriter and musician David Bowie and his first wife, Angela \"Angie\" Bowie (\"née\" Barnett), an American model and actress who was born and raised in Cyprus. His mother also has Polish ancestry. His maternal grandfather, George, was a United States Army veteran and mining engineer who ran a mill for the Cyprus Mines Corporation, while his maternal grandmother, Helena, was a naturalized Canadian. His birth prompted his father to write the songs \"Kooks\" and \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" for his 1971 album \"Hunky Dory\".\n\nMostly raised by his Scottish nanny, Marion Skene, Jones spent time growing up in London, Berlin, and Vevey. He attended the first and second grade at the Commonwealth American School (now the International School of Lausanne) in Lausanne. When his parents divorced in February 1980, his father was granted custody of eight-year-old Jones (who was then known as \"Zowie Bowie\" to rhyme with his father's stage name) and he visited his mother on school holidays until ending contact with her at age 13. At age 14, he enrolled in the Scottish boarding school Gordonstoun. At the age of 12, he decided that he preferred to be called \"Joey\", and used this nickname until shortening it to \"Joe\" in his later teen years. The press reported that he went by \"Joe\" in 1992 when attending his father's wedding to fashion model Iman, where he was the best man. He reverted to his birth name around the age of 18.\n\nJones is the half-brother of Alexandria \"Lexi\" Jones (born 2000), the daughter of his father and his father's second wife, Iman. He is also the half-brother of Stacia Larranna Celeste Lipka (born 1980) from his mother's relationship with musician Andrew Lipka, better known as Drew Blood. He has a stepsister, Zulekha Haywood (born 1978), who is the daughter of Iman and former NBA basketball player Spencer Haywood, Iman's second husband. By 1995, Jones graduated with a bachelor's degree in philosophy from the College of Wooster. He then pursued a Ph.D degree at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, but left before completion to attend London Film School, where he then graduated as a director in 2001. Whilst growing up, Jones dreamed of becoming a professional wrestler, and his father frequently praised what he called Jones' \"natural strength\".\n\nJones was one of many cameramen at his father's widely televised 50th birthday party directed by Englishman Tim Pope at Madison Square Garden in 1997 and also at two BowieNet concerts at Roseland Ballroom in New York City in June 2000. He was also the in-game cinematics director for the political simulator \"\", as well as scripting elements of the game.\n\nJones directed the 2006 campaign for the French Connection fashion label. The concept of 'Fashion vs Style' was to re-invigorate the brand and move it away from the former incarnation of FCUK, which style pundits believed had become tired and overused. The advert debuted in the week ending 20 February 2006 and featured two women (representing fashion and style) fighting and briefly kissing each other. The advertisement generated 127 complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority.\n\nJones's first feature film, \"Moon\", was nominated for seven British Independent Film Awards in 2009, and won two, Best British Independent Film, and the Douglas Hickox Award for Best British Director on their debut feature. It was also nominated for two BAFTA Awards at the 2010 ceremony, winning Jones the BAFTA Award for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer. The film has received 19 other nominations from film festivals and societies, including the BAFTA Carl Foreman Award.\n\nHe directed the Summit Entertainment project \"Source Code\", a science-fiction thriller from Vendome Pictures, which was produced by Mark Gordon. \"Source Code\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 26July 2011 in the United States.\n\nJones directed and co-wrote \"Warcraft\", based on the video game series of the same name, which was released in the summer of 2016. Jones next film would return to the science fiction genre and be called \"Mute\", starring Alexander Skarsgård and Paul Rudd. Jones had been developing the project for years and described it as a \"spiritual sequel\" to \"Moon\", and was inspired by Ridley Scott's \"Blade Runner\". The film, set in Berlin forty years in the future, follows a mute bartender investigating his lover's disappearance. The film was produced and released by Netflix, and became available to stream world-wide in February 2018.\n\nThrough his social media, Jones announced his next project will be a superhero movie, centered around the Rogue Trooper, based on the 2000 AD Comics character.\n\nJones announced his engagement to photographer Rodene Ronquillo on 28 June 2012. They married on 6 November 2012. On the same day, Ronquillo was diagnosed with breast cancer. The couple have been campaigning to raise awareness for the disease and for early diagnosis since then. On 10 July 2016, Ronquillo gave birth to their first child, a son. On 1 October 2017, Jones announced that he and Ronquillo were expecting a second child. Jones announced the birth of their daughter on 18 April 2018.\n\n"}

He worked in his uncle's chemical factory from the age of 21.\n\nIn 1861, he developed the ammonia-soda process for the manufacturing of soda ash (anhydrous sodium carbonate) from brine (as a source of sodium chloride) and limestone (as a source of calcium carbonate). The process was an improvement over the earlier Leblanc process.\n\nHe founded the company Solvay & Cie and established his first factory at Couillet (now merged into Charleroi, Belgium) in 1863 and further perfected the process until 1872, when he patented it. Soon, Solvay process plants were established in the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany and Austria. Today, about 70 Solvay process plants are still operational worldwide.\n\nThe exploitation of his patents brought Solvay considerable wealth, which he used for philanthropic purposes, including the establishment in 1894 of the \"Institut des Sciences Sociales\" (ISS) or Institute for Sociology at the Free University of Brussels (now split into the Université Libre de Bruxelles and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel), as well as International Institutes for Physics and Chemistry. In 1903, he founded the Solvay Business School which is also part of the Free University of Brussels. In 1911, he began a series of important conferences in physics, known as the Solvay Conferences, whose participants included luminaries such as Max Planck, Ernest Rutherford, Maria Skłodowska-Curie, Henri Poincaré, and (then only 32 years old) Albert Einstein. A later conference would include Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, and Erwin Schrödinger.\n\nHe was twice elected to the Belgian Senate for the Liberal Party and granted honorary title of Minister of State at the end of his life.

{"id": "13012677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13012677", "title": "Essential facilities doctrine", "text": "Essential facilities doctrine\n\nThe essential facilities doctrine (sometimes also referred to as the essential facility doctrine) is a legal doctrine which describes a particular type of claim of monopolization made under competition laws. In general, it refers to a type of anti-competitive behavior in which a firm with market power uses a \"bottleneck\" in a market to deny competitors entry into the market. It is closely related to a claim for refusal to deal.\n\nThe doctrine has its origins in United States law, but it has been adopted (often with some modification) into the legal systems of the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, and the European Union.\n\nUnder the essential facilities doctrine, a monopolist found to own \"a facility essential to other competitors\" is required to provide reasonable use of that facility, unless some aspect of it precludes shared access. The basic elements of a legal claim under this doctrine under United States antitrust law, which a plaintiff is required to show to establish liability, are:\n\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in \"Verizon v. Trinko\", 540 U.S. 398 (2004), in effect added a fifth element: absence of regulatory oversight from an agency (the Federal Communications Commission, in that case) with power to compel access.\n\nThese elements are difficult for potential plaintiffs to establish for several reasons. It is quite difficult for a plaintiff to demonstrate that a particular facility is \"essential\" to entry into and/or competition within the relevant market. The plaintiff must demonstrate that the \"facility\" must be something so indispensable to entry or competition that it would be impossible for smaller firms to compete with the market leader. Likewise, the plaintiff must show that compelling the dominant firm to permit others to use the facility would not interfere with the ability of the dominant firm to serve its own customers.\n\nThe first notable case to address the anti-competitive implications of an essential facility was the Supreme Court's judgment in \"United States v. Terminal Railroad Association\", 224 U.S. 383 (1912). A group of railroads controlling all railway bridges and switching yards into and out of St. Louis prevented competing railway companies from offering transportation to and through that destination. The court held it to be an illegal restraint of trade.\n\nSimilar decisions include,\n\nThere is controversy about what exactly constitutes an \"essential facility\". While the doctrine has most frequently been applied to natural monopolies such as utilities and owners of transportation facilities, it has also been applied in situations involving intellectual property. For example, it is possible for a court to apply the doctrine in a case where one competitor refuses to sell materials protected by copyright or patent to potential competitors.\n\n\nSullivan, E.

He rose through the ranks of this company and became head of EDP in 1990, where he was responsible for the implementation of a transport administration IT system across Europe.\n\nIn 1994, he moved to Carlsberg, serving in various key senior logistics roles before he moved on to the electrical wholesale company Storel in 1998, where he eventually became managing director. In 2002, he became the CEO of logistics firm Schenker North, where he later became a board member in 2005.\n\nIn 2006, Bushke joined the German energy company E.ON’s Swedish division, E.ON Sverige, where he served as senior vice president before being appointed as president and CEO of the entire Nordic region. It was his successful time here that made his reputation as future candidate for Saab’s leadership.\n\nIn September 2010, Bushke was appointed as CEO of Saab Group, with the chairman Marcus Wallenberg choosing him for his breadth of expertise and focus on the high-tech field.\n\nBushke is married with three daughters. The oldest daughter Katrine (b. 1988) lives in Gothenburg.\n"}

The road runs from Patung Pemuda Membangun at the south end to the bridge of the West Flood Canal at the north. The road had been built between 1949 and 1953 to connect Central Jakarta with Kebayoran Baru. The historically-prominent road is located in one of Jakarta's central business district area, marking the western side of Jakarta Golden Triangle and the eastern side of Jakarta Platinum Triangle.\n\nSudirman is one of Jakarta's most prominent main roads because of its location in the city's central business district. Sudirman Road was constructed in the late 1940s and was the foundation of the modern image of Jakarta. The road was named after a National Hero Sudirman, whose statue was erected near the north end of the road in September 2001. The entire length of Sudirman Road marks the boundary of Central Jakarta (north of the road) and South Jakarta (south of the road).\n\nSudirman Road suffers from Jakarta's heavy traffic congestion. In June 2016, an odd-even traffic scheme was implemented on Sudirman, replacing the \"Three-in-One\" scheme which was introduced on December 23, 2003. The replacement was deemed necessary in order to eliminate the informal profession of car jockeys, which caused more problems than solutions. The odd-even license plate scheme is ti serve as a transitional regulation before an electronic road pricing system is implemented in 2017.\n\nSudirman Road and Thamrin Road were built between 1949 and 1953 with the purpose to connect the suburb Kebayoran with Central Jakarta. The plan of Sudirman Road has been laid out at least since the colonial period in the 1930s as part of Batavia's street network expansion plan to the south of the west Flood Canal. The street planning that would become Sudirman Road is probably the only street planning south of the canal from the colonial period that was actually implemented after Indonesia's independence. The area where Sudirman Road would be laid were mainly kampung settlements, with rice plantation along the west bank of Krukut River and patches of coconut and fruit tree plantations.\n\nWith the development of the Kebayoran suburb to the south of Jakarta, there was a need to construct a road connecting the new suburb with the city center. Construction of the road started immediately in 1949 and was largely completed in 1953. This nameless road was dubbed \"Kebayoran Road\" or simply \"weg naar Kebayoran Baru\" (Dutch \"the road to Kebayoran Baru\") The new road is rural in quality, lacking planned development on both side of the road. With the nationalization of road names in late 1950s, the road received a name Djalan Raja Djendral Sudirman (General Sudirman Main Road) after a National Hero. Some high-profile events were held in Sudirman Road e.g. the \"Pekan Raya\" or international trade and entertainment fairs, held between 1953-1955 on the site where Atma Jaya University now stands. The \"Pekan Raya\" event was the precursor of the Jakarta Fairs that was held at Medan Merdeka Selatan from 1968 to 1991, before it was relocated to an area of the converted Kemayoran Airport in 1992, where they are still held today.\n\nDevelopments along Sudirman Road was relatively slow compared with the fast development of Thamrin Road. In the 1960s, the only apparent development along Sudirman Road were the residential neighborhood of Benhil and Setiabudi, which was mostly planned for government workers. These residential neighborhoods was designed with access to Sudirman Road. Other than these residential neighborhoods, Sudirman Road was devoid of any commercial developments. In 1963, the sports event GANEFO was held using the Sudirman Road as the main access to the new stadium.\n\nOnly during the 1970s that the Sudirman Road began to experience signs of development along the road, which first appeared north of Semanggi. Among the first office buildings to be built at Sudirman Road were Wisma Arthaloka (1976), Toyota Astra, Wisma Harapan, Wisma Benhil, Atma Jaya University, Wisma Metropolitan I, Hotel Sahid Jaya, Balai Sarbini, and Gedung Veteran (Graha Purna Yudha, 1973). There was also a GKBI \"batik\" cooperatives building on the northwest corner of Semanggi; which would be replaced by Wisma GKBI office tower.\n\nThe late 1970s saw the construction of Gedung Panin, S. Widjoyo Center, and Ratu Plaza shopping complex.\n\nThe 1980s saw construction boom in Sudirman Road, among them were Prince Centre (Gedung Pangeran), Chase Plaza, Wisma Indocement, Wisma BCA, Summitmas Tower, Mid Plaza, Sentral Plaza, and Wisma Bumiputera.\n\nOn December 23, 2003, a \"3-in-1\" scheme was introduced for Sudirman Road by Governor Sutiyoso to deal with the worsening traffic. In February 2004, the Corridor 1 of TransJakarta Bus Rapid Transit was commercially opened. The new line transformed one lane of the Sudirman Road into a dedicated bus lane unaffected by traffic.\n\nJakarta Mass Rapid Transit project which commenced in the end of 2013 would transform Sudirman Road following a transit-oriented scheme. MRT entrances will be constructed at the widened sidewalk, which was done by transforming the slow lane into wider sidewalk. To reduce the congestion, an electronic road pricing system will be introduced in 2017 to Sudirman Road.\n\n\n"}

John Ames was born April 7, 1738, second son of Thomas and Keziah Howard. He married Susanna Howard in 1759 or 1757. Their children were: David, Keziah and Susanna, Huldah, Abigail, Cynthia, John, and Oliver Ames, Sr.\n\nAmes was a blacksmith in Bridgewater, Massachusetts. After the \"nail and splitting mills\" were outlawed by the government in Great Britain to give iron manufacturers in Britain a monopoly in 1773, Ames switched to making shovels. Despite having only a crude factory, he was able to make shovels of notable quality. In fact, he was said to have developed a shovel \"so perfect that further improvement seems impossible.\"\nThe remains of his trip hammer stone and man-made weirs and dams can be seen at War Memorial Park (West Bridgewater, Massachusetts).\n\nJohn Ames made guns for the Massachusetts army during the American Revolutionary War.\n\nDuring the war, Ames served in the Massachusetts Militia. In December 1776, the Militia was sent to Newport, RI to try and prevent British troops from securing a stronghold. John served 15 days alongside two of Washington's generals (one being Benedict Arnold). In June 1778, they returned to Newport to assist a French fleet in attacks against the British but were sent home after 24 days when the Continental Army under Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette did not arrive. The last documented service was in July, 1780, when Admiral de Ternay (Charles-Henri-Louis d'Arsac de Ternay) landed 6,000 French troops in Rhode Island and the Militia was sent to protect them from the British. He served as captain in Colonel Edward Mitchell's Regiment in 1776; as captain in Colonel Wade's Regiment, 1778; captain in Major Eliphalet Carey's Regiment, 1780; and Second Major of the 3d Regiment, 1780. Despite being promoted to major, he was known as \"captain\" for the rest of his life.\n\nCaptain John Ames died July 17, 1803 in Bridgewater, Massachusetts.\n\nThe Ames family eventually became a very influential and wealthy family in Massachusetts, establishing two factories as well as having influence in the American railroad expansion and government.\n\nCapt. John's son David Ames (born 1760) was appointed by George Washington to be the first head of the Springfield Armory.\n\nTwo factories were started by descendants of Capt. John Ames, in different regions of Massachusetts. Ames' son Oliver Ames, Sr. went on to found the Ames Shovel Shop in Easton, Massachusetts. Ames' descendants (grandchildren?), brothers James Tyler Ames and Nathan Peabody Ames, went on to found the Ames Manufacturing Company in Chicopee, Massachusetts in 1835.\n\nHis great-grandson Oliver Ames became governor of Massachusetts, 1887–1890.\n"}

Kohler founded what later became known as the Kohler Company, a large producer of bathroom and kitchen products.\n\nKohler was born on November 3, 1844 in the Alpine village of Schnepfau, Austria, the fourth child of dairy farmer John Michael Kohler Sr. (1805–74) and his wife, the former Maria Anna Moosbrugger (1816–53). After his wife's death, the elder Kohler remarried, and he and his large family emigrated to the United States. With help from a relative, the Kohlers built up a promising dairy business.\n\nAfter a limited formal education, John Michael Kohler found work in St. Paul, Minnesota. In 1865 he moved to Chicago, Illinois and became a traveling salesman. In Sheboygan, Wisconsin, 56 miles north of Milwaukee on Lake Michigan, he met Lillie Vollrath (1848–1883), the daughter of local steel and iron industrialist Jacob Vollrath (1824–1898). The couple was married in 1871.\n\nShortly after his marriage, Kohler worked at the steel and iron factory his father-in-law partly owned. He took over the company two years later during the Panic of 1873. By the early 1880s, the firm was producing a variety of iron and enamelware products. In 1883, Kohler put ornamental feet on a cast-iron water trough and sold it as a bathtub. Four years later, more than two-thirds of the company's business was in plumbing products and enamelware. In 1888, Kohler and two partners had the firm incorporated.\n\nIn 1899, Kohler purchased 21 acres of farmland four miles west of Sheboygan, intending to move his entire company to the location. Shortly after the new factory was constructed, in 1900, Kohler died at 56, likely of heart failure.\n\nFive years later, 30-year-old Walter J. Kohler assumed his father's corporate presidency and began to guide the firm. In 1912, it was officially designated the Kohler Company, and the property surrounding the plant became the Village of Kohler.\n\nFrom 1880 until his death Kohler served in several governmental offices. In 1892 he became Mayor. Citizens also admired Kohler for his generous contributions and leadership in the areas of art and culture, symbols of Sheboygan's desire to be more than a factory town.\n\nThe John Michael Kohler Arts Center, which occupies a square block in downtown Sheboygan (containing Kohler's restored Gilded Age home along with modern buildings), is named for Kohler, as is John Michael Kohler State Park, established on land donated in 1966 by the Kohler family.\n\nThe Kohlers had six children, including Walter Jodok Kohler, Sr. (1875-40), who would later be Governor of Wisconsin. In 1887, four years after his wife Lillie's death, John married Lillie's sister, Wilhelmina (Minnie) Vollrath (1852–1929), and they had one child, Herbert Vollrath Kohler Sr (1891–1968). This Kohler was to become the dominant force in the Kohler company for many years, presiding over the longest strike in American history.\n\nThe large and fashionable Kohler family home in Sheboygan was filled with music, books, and constant lessons in ethics and public service. The entire Sheboygan area mourned Kohler's 1900 death. John's three daughters remained in the Kohler house, unmarried, for the rest of their lives, frequently wearing black.\n\n"}

His late brother Joe also went into construction in London, trading as Murphy Ltd and using grey vehicles, but that company went into administration and closed in 2013.\n\nMurphy was born at Loughmark, near Cahersiveen, County Kerry. He left school at 15 but found work hard to come by. He travelled to London and started up as a subcontractor in the building trade. The Second World War offered him a golden opportunity. New airfields were urgently needed and later on runway repairs were needed also. He was successful in providing this service and at end of the war was well placed to help with large-scale reconstruction. Other ventures included electrification, cable installation, water facilities and road-building.\n\nAt his death in 2009, his worth was estimated at about £190 million. He valued his privacy and was known to spend little on luxuries, instead preferring to spend time with his own workmen and other Irish friends.\n\nIn the 1970s a specialist division of the company worked on the development of natural gas.

{"id": "247409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=247409", "title": "Lien", "text": "Lien\n\nA lien ( or ) is a form of security interest granted over an item of property to secure the payment of a debt or performance of some other obligation. The owner of the property, who grants the lien, is referred to as the \"lienee\" and the person who has the benefit of the lien is referred to as the \"lienor\" or \"lien holder\".\n\nThe etymological root is Anglo-French \"lien\", \"loyen\" \"bond\", \"restraint\", from Latin \"ligamen\", from \"ligare\" \"to bind\".\n\nIn the United States, the term lien generally refers to a wide range of encumbrances and would include other forms of mortgage or charge. In the US, a lien characteristically refers to \"nonpossessory\" security interests (see generally: Security interest—categories).\n\nIn other common-law countries, the term lien refers to a very specific type of security interest, being a passive right to retain (but not sell) property until the debt or other obligation is discharged. In contrast to the usage of the term in the US, in other countries it refers to a purely \"possessory\" form of security interest; indeed, when possession of the property is lost, the lien is released. However, common-law countries also recognize a slightly anomalous form of security interest called an \"equitable lien\" which arises in certain rare instances.\n\nDespite their differences in terminology and application, there are a number of similarities between liens in the US and elsewhere in the common-law world.\n\nLiens can be consensual or non-consensual (also termed voluntary or involuntary in different states). Consensual liens are imposed by a contract between the creditor and the debtor:\n\n\nNonconsensual liens typically arise by statute or by the operation of the common law. Those laws give a creditor the right to impose a lien on an item of real property or a chattel by the existence of the relationship of creditor and debtor. Those liens include\n\n\nLiens are also \"perfected\" or \"unperfected\" (see perfection). Perfected liens are those liens for which a creditor has established a priority right in the encumbered property with respect to third party creditors. Perfection is generally accomplished by taking steps required by law to give third party creditors notice of the lien. The fact that an item of property is in the hands of the creditor usually constitutes perfection. Where the property remains in the hands of the debtor, some further step must be taken, like recording a notice of the security interest with the appropriate office.\n\nPerfecting a lien is an important part of the task of protecting the secured creditor's interest in the property. A perfected lien is valid against bona fide purchasers of property, and even against a trustee in bankruptcy; an unperfected lien may not be.\n\nIn the United States, references to an \"equitable lien\" is a right, enforceable only in equity, to have a demand satisfied out of a particular fund or specific property without having possession of the fund or property. An equitable lien is actually a legal remedy, rather than a security interest created in contemplation of or in support of a transaction. In U.S. law, such liens characteristically arise in four circumstances:\n\nMovers are typically entitled to a mover's lien under UCC § 7-307/308, to withhold a customer's goods to secure payment. This is a possessory lien, and is the non-consensual type of lien (because it exists automatically under a statute instead of being affirmatively agreed upon). However, the concept of a mover's lien is often abused in a moving scam known as a hostage load, whereby the moving company will fraudulently extort money not owed by the customer by refusing to deliver the goods unless the customer pays money inflated beyond the contractual estimate. Because the customer has an interest in obtaining their own goods, they are under duress to pay the ransom. Hostage loads in at least the interstate context are illegal under 49 U.S.C. 13905. The FMCSA regulates the moving industry and sometimes takes enforcement action by fining and/or delicensure of offending moving companies. Moving companies that deliberately engage in hostage-loading may also be considered to be engaging in racketeering in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.\n\nDisputes between legitimate lienholding of chattels vs. hostage-loading can sometimes be averted by the customer including an advanced (before-the-fact) consensual waiver of the mover's right to a lien in the written contract, obligating the moving company to deliver the goods with reasonable dispatch regardless of disputes over payment, and failure to do so would constitute conversion or trespass to chattels.\n\nOutside of the US, a common-law lien may be defined in general terms as a passive right to retain a chattel (and, in certain cases, documentary intangibles and papers) conferred by law. Modern law has generally left the legal lien to cases where it has been historically established without any real effort being made to make it applicable to modern conditions. In \"Tappenden v Artus\" [1964] 2 QB 185 Diplock LJ referred to a lien as a \"self help\" remedy, like \"other primitive remedies such as abatement of nuisance, self-defence or ejection of trespassers to land\". Equitable liens are an unusual species of property right, usually considered \"sui generis\".\n\nCommon-law liens are divided into \"special liens\" and \"general liens\". A special lien, the more common kind, requires a close connection between the property and the service rendered. A special lien can only be exercised in respect of fees relating to the instant transaction; the lienor cannot use the property held as security for past debts as well. A general lien affects all of the property of the lienee in the possession of the lienor, and stands as security for all of the debts of the lienee to the lienor. A special lien can be extended to a general lien by contract, and this is commonly done in the case of carriers. A common-law lien only gives a passive right to retain; there is no power of sale which arises at common law, although some statutes have also conferred an additional power of sale, and it is possible to confer a separate power of sale by contract.\n\nThe common-law liens are closely aligned to the so-called \"common callings\", but are not co-extensive with them.\n\nA common-law lien is a very limited type of security interest. Apart from the fact that it only amounts to a passive right to retain, a lien cannot be transferred; it cannot be asserted by a third party to whom possession of the goods is given to perform the same services that the original party should have performed; and if the chattel is surrendered to the lienor, the lien entitlement is lost forever (except for where the parties agree that the lien shall survive a temporary re-possession by the lienor). A lienee who sells the chattel unlawfully may be liable in conversion as well as surrendering the lien.\n\nIn common-law countries, equitable liens give rise to unique and difficult issues. An equitable lien is a nonpossessory security right conferred by operation of law, which is similar in effect to an equitable charge. It differs from a charge in that it is non-consensual. It is conferred only in very limited circumstances, the most common (and least ambiguous) of which is in relation to the sale of land; an unpaid vendor has an equitable lien over the land for the purchase price, notwithstanding that the purchaser has gone into occupation of the property. It is seen as a counterweight to the equitable rule which confers a beneficial interest in the land on the purchaser once contracts are exchanged for purchase.\n\nIt is a matter of conjecture how far equitable liens extend outside of the unpaid vendor's lien. Equitable liens have been held to exist in a number of cases involving choses in action, but not yet in relation to chattels. The Australian courts have been the most receptive towards equitable liens in relation to personal property (see \"Hewett v Court\" (1983) 57 ALJR 211, but a review of the cases still leaves a lack of clarity in relation to the principles upon which an equitable lien will be imposed.\nBut overall, there is still perceived to be a lack of central nexus.\n\nAlthough arguably not liens as such, two other forms of encumbrance are sometimes referred to as liens.\n\nCertain statutes provide for a passive right to retain property against its owner as security for obligations. For example, section 88 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 of the United Kingdom permits an airport to detain aircraft for unpaid airport charges and aviation fuel. Although this right has been treated as a lien under UK insolvency law, it has been argued that such statutory rights are not in fact liens, but rights analogous to liens, although some might say that this is a distinction without a difference.\n\nIt has also been argued that an agreement by contract that one party may retain the goods of another party until paid is not a lien, as under the common law, liens could only be non-consensual. However, it appears that under insolvency law, such rights will be treated as liens even if they are not expressed to be liens.\n\nA maritime lien is a lien on a vessel, given to secure the claim of a creditor who provided maritime services to the vessel or who suffered an injury from the vessel's use. Maritime liens are sometimes referred to as \"tacit hypothecation\". Maritime liens have little in common with other liens under the laws of most jurisdictions.\n\nThe maritime lien has been described as \"one of the most striking peculiarities of Admiralty law\". A maritime lien constitutes a security interest upon ships of a nature otherwise unknown to the common law or equity. It arises purely by operation of law and exists as a claim upon the property concerned, both secret and invisible, often given priority by statute over other forms of registered security interest. Although characteristics vary under the laws of different countries, it can be described as:\n\nThroughout the world, there are a large number of different types and sub-divisions of liens. Not all of the following liens exist in all legal systems that recognise the concept of a lien. The following are descriptions that are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Types of lien include\n\n\n"}

He held different cabinet posts in the 1950s.\n\nPrince Misha'al was born on 5 September 1926. He was the thirteenth son of Ibn Saud.\n\nHe was the full brother of Prince Mansour, Prince Mutaib and Princess Qumash who died on 26 September 2011. Their mother was the Lebanese-born, Shahida, (died 1938), who reportedly was the favorite wife of Ibn Saud.\n\nPrince Mishaal served as the Minister of Defense from 12 May 1951 to 1953. He replaced his full brother Prince Mansour as minister of defense when he died of alcohol poisoning after a party hosted by then-Riyadh governor Nasser bin Abdulaziz in 1951. Until that date, Prince Mishaal served as deputy minister of defense. When he became minister, his younger full brother Prince Mutaib was appointed his deputy. As minister of defense, he became one of the most affluent princes in the Al Saud family. He bought state land for very cheap prices and yielded extraordinary profits. But because of his lack of education and experience, Prince Mishaal let the ministry remain completely unorganized. He leaned heavily on advice and recommendation from foreign counsel. He wielded significant influence in Ibn Saud's government. Because of Mishaal's considerable power, Ibn Saud countered his influence by appointing Abdullah bin Faisal as minister of health and interior.\n\nAt the same time, Ibn Saud established the ministry of air force under Prince Mishaal to prevent flight-related matters from going under Prince Talal, the then minister of communication. Since Mishaal and Talal could not agree, Saudi Arabia was to have two airline fleets. But in April 1955, Prince Talal resigned and the ministry of communication was merged with ministry of finance. In May 1955, King Saud created a renewed modern National Guard. This was led by Saud's son Prince Khalid who replaced a commoner. This move weakened Prince Mishaal because he had often used the old National Guard's resources.\n\nMishaal and his full-brother Mutaib were ousted from the office under King Saud but they returned to favour in 1963 under regent and later King Faisal who entrusted them a key governorship and deputy governorship, respectively. Specifically, Mishaal served as Governor of Makkah Province from 1963 to 1971. Both Mishaal and Mutaib resigned from their posts in 1971 for reasons that are not entirely clear. Prince Mishaal was appointed chairman of the Allegiance Council on 10 December 2007.\n\nMishaal bin Abdulaziz protested more than once that he should have been crown prince since he served as both a governor and a minister and was older than some of his brothers. Mishaal's firm, Mishaal International, along with its German and Chinese partners, is the leading contender to build much of the Kingdom's new multibillion-dollar railway system. On the other hand, it is argued that he was immediately excluded from the competition for the title of crown prince by the Sudairi brothers.\n\nMishaal bin Abdulaziz was impartial in family politics, although he was known to incline towards King Abdallah or be one of King Abdullah's close allies. His neutral stance made him the perfect choice to be the chairman of the Allegiance Council.

His company constructed the first theater of Üsküb (now Skopje) and participated in the development of the railway line that connected Kosovo with Skopje – a project which he personally financed.\n\nAn active Albanian rights activist, he was also the only Catholic to be elected to the city council of Skopje. Bojaxhiu died in 1919 in obscure circumstances, which led to reports that attributed his death to poisoning by Serbian agents. His children included Lazar, and Agnes Bojaxhiu (Mother Teresa).\n\nNikollë was born in 1874 in Prizren to Lazër and Çilja Bojaxhiu. Bojaxhiu moved to Skopje in the Kosovo Vilayet (present-day Macedonia) after 1900, where he first worked as a pharmacist and later became a partner in a construction company. He was a polyglot; as well as Albanian he also spoke French, Italian, Macedonian, Serbo-Croat and Turkish. In the early 1900s, he married Dranafile Bernai with whom he had three children: Aga (b. 1905), Lazar (b. 1908) and Agnes (b. 1910), with the latter becoming later better known as Mother Teresa. Nikollë Bojaxhiu's company constructed the city's first theater and part of the railway line that connected Skopje with the region of Kosovo. He was also the owner of a wholesale food company and the only Roman Catholic member of the city council of Skopje.\n\nOn the day of the Albanian Declaration of Independence (November 28, 1912) he hosted a meeting that was attended by Bajram Curri and Hasan Prishtina among others. After the region's incorporation into Serbia, Bojaxhiu joined various Albanian rights political organizations. He died in 1919, a few hours after he returned from a political meeting in Belgrade. Several biographers have attributed his death to poisoning by Serbian agents. The location, purpose and participants of the meeting remain unknown. His son Lazar considered the theory of poisoning to be a certainty, while his daughter Agnes described it as unconfirmed. \n\nHis funeral process was attended by large numbers of people and representative of all the religious communities. As a sign of respect, that day all school children were given dedicatory handkerchiefs and jewellers' shops remained closed. After his death, his partner appropriated the entirety of their companies' assets and left nothing to his widow and offspring.\n\nNikollë Bojaxhiu was born into a Kosovar Albanian family. In 2003 Albanian scholar claimed that Nikollë Bojaxhiu could have been of Aromanian origin, mainly based on a document, found by Macedonian author Stojan Trencevski, which asserted that Mr. Bojaxhiu was, at some point, the representative of the Aromanian community of Skopje. However this hypothesis has been rejected by scholar Albert Ramaj, who, based on the testimony of a contemporary, Lalush Lalevski, argues that the representative of the Aromanian community at the time, whose last name was Boiadjijev, was another person, and entirely unrelated to Nikollë Bojaxhiu. Ramaj's position was later endorsed by scholars Ukshini and Xhufi. Mother Teresa had said: “By blood, I am Albanian. By citizenship, an Indian. By faith, I am a Catholic nun. As to my calling, I belong to the world. As to my heart, I belong entirely to the heart of Jesus.”\n"}

{"id": "51119912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51119912", "title": "PinpointBPS", "text": "PinpointBPS\n\nPinpointBPS is a methodology for process improvement in laboratories. It is underpinned by eight principles that form the basis for decision-making in a laboratory. While its application is mainly in healthcare — particularly medical laboratories — it has also been applied in other industries. The methodology has been heralded as \"groundbreaking\" in the field of laboratory performance improvement.\n\nMedical laboratories operate in highly regulated environments that demand consistent quality of patient outputs. The external environment’s impact on the broader global healthcare industry is also dictating the need for ongoing improvements in quality and delivery while using fewer resources that leads to cost savings. Among other regulations, the Carter Report in the United Kingdom dictates that GBP£200-million in cost savings must be achieved by 2020, while the Affordable Care Act in the United States, also known as Obamacare, imposed further taxation requirements on medical laboratories, reducing cost saving ability. Dr. Jonathan Berg stated at The Royal College of Pathologists' annual meeting in 2012 that \"We need to be creative and innovative in the services we offer, and we need to get our finances under control\", indicating the critical need for innovation within pathology and a stronger focus on financial controls and performance. Within this context, PinpointBPS was founded as a methodology focusing on innovation, risk reduction and financial impact relating to laboratory performance improvement.\n\nThe PinpointBPS methodology is centered on the following process of discovery that highlights current performance, expected future performance and the means to achieve it. The methodology has also been aligned with ISO 15189 requirements.\n\nThe steps below provide a high-level overview of the methodology in practice.\n\nWhile all effort within the laboratory is put into value creation, from turnaround time improvements to quality output and cost savings / profit increases, it is important that the performance of each of these can be quantified and their relationship with the financial performance of the laboratory understood. This enables the laboratory to understand current performance needs while at the same time establishing the key performance indicators that are important and should be measured.\n\nUnderstanding the current performance of the laboratory provides the necessary context to highlight performance improvement requirements as well as areas of excellence. This should be conducted by looking at sample turnaround time and resource utilization, and should be considered on a holistic basis, creating a virtual model of the whole laboratory by mapping out all processes and activities in detail. This provides an end-to-end perspective on current performance and forms the basis for future performance improvement initiatives.\n\nThe expectation for future performance should be done through business process modeling, with current performance as the foundation. Using LIS data as well as data from workforce scheduling, and combining this data with the process model of the laboratory, creates an environment where changes to the laboratory can be simulated and the impact to performance understood in quantifiable terms. It is important to validate both the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the model. Once a desirable outcome for future performance has been found, the difference (or delta) in performance is evaluated to understand future performance requirements.\n\nThe difference in performance between current (baseline) and future (expected) performance highlights the necessary process changes and related initiatives that are required to achieve the future performance. This impact should be measured according to finance (cost or profit), quality and turnaround time. For these changes to take effect, each change initiative is prioritized based on a quantified understanding of its impact to the laboratory 'bottom line', while also improving turnaround time, quality or both.\n\nWhile the PinpointBPS methodology can support Lean (and other continuous improvement methodologies like Six Sigma) in that it ultimately aims to provide patients and other stakeholders with quality outputs, its approach differs from other methodologies like the Lean Laboratory in various ways:\n\nPinpointPBS has been based on eight practical principles that allow laboratories to take ownership of the methodology and performance improvement initiatives.\n\nAs with any organization, value creation is the ultimate goal, however purely focusing on quality output may neglect cognizance of financial value. Understanding the ultimate financial impact of any value creating activity is critical for ongoing sustainability.\n\nEnsuring that everyone in the organization (and value chain) has the same understanding of value creation and how it links to financial performance\n\nContinuous innovation requires us to draw from the same knowledge and speak the same language. We establish a universal truth that enables us to work together seamlessly.\n\nWe value a clear line of sight into our strengths, our weaknesses and the connections between every process, person, and piece of technology.\n\nWe believe in making decisions based on evidence. In our quest for bottom-line impact, every business action must be supported by real, tangible proof.\n\nWe are empowered through understanding our performance and what shapes it. This allows everyone in our organization to make decisions swiftly, with understanding and certainty.\n\nClose is not close enough. Every decision we take is based on fact, and our execution must be accomplished with the same precision\n\nWe believe in following the big opportunities that significantly impact the bottom line, rather than wasting time and resources on those that do not.\n\nWe are only as good as the collective we represent. We fundamentally believe in continually imparting knowledge and learning from each other to move the industry forward.\n\nVarious tools have been developed to enable the methodology in laboratories, including performance overviews, standardized process mapping using BPMN (business process model and notation), as well as simulation and scenario modeling.\n\nPinpointBPS professional certification can be granted to both laboratories that practice the methodology, as well as people who have successfully completed further study of the methodology. Two levels of PinpointBPS professional certifications exist. These certifications have been accredited by PACE, CPD, and the Royal College of Pathologists.\n\nA PinpointBPS Champion is a professional who is able to interpret laboratory performance improvement metrics, map out all processes within a laboratory and make improvement recommendations.\n\nA PinpointBPS Master builds on the PinpointBPS Champion certification and is a professional who is able to simulate changes to a laboratory and interpret performance outputs, to make performance improvement recommendations and manage initiatives from start to end.\n"}
{"id": "55525745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55525745", "title": "Preferred metric sizes", "text": "Preferred metric sizes\n\nPreferred metric sizes are a set of international standards and de facto standards that are designed to make using the metric system easier and simpler, especially in engineering and construction practices. One of the methods used to arrive at these preferred sizes is the use of preferred numbers and convenient numbers such as the Renard series, the 1-2-5 series to limit the number of different sizes of components needed.\n\nOne of the largest benefits of such limits is an ensuing multiplicative or exponential reduction in the number of parts, tools and other items needed to support the installation and maintenance of the items built using these techniques. This occurs because eliminating one diameter fastener will typically allow the elimination of a large number of variations on that diameter (multiple thread pitches, multiple lengths, multiple tip types, multiple head types, multiple drive types, and the tools needed for installing each, including multiple drill bits (one for each different thread pitch, material, and fit combination).\n\nInternational agreements, including 75/106/EEC, specify 0.1, 0.25 (), 0.375 (), 0.5 (), 0.75 (), 1, 1.5, 2, 3, and 5 litres as the capacities of liquor bottles allowed in international commerce.\n\nIn the United States, the alcohol industry switched to metric bottle sizes on October 1, 1976, abandoning the existing 38 sizes of bottles and instead adopting the following sizes: \n\n\nSee Also:\n\nSystem 32 is a standard for the design and manufacture of furniture, most commonly used in the design of cabinets, wherein the major parts (sides, doors, etc.) are available in increments of 32 mm, and shelf supports consist of columns of 5 mm holes on 32 mm centers.\n\nThe ISO 2848 basic module is a unit of 100 mm, often represented by a single capital \"M\", along with 300 mm and 600 mm groupings, that is widely used for the widths of furniture in Europe.\n\nISO 216 standard specifies the A sizes of paper, including the very common A4, wherein the base size of A0 is one square meter, and the ratio between the height and width is , which results in all sizes of paper having the same aspect ratio.\n\nAlso related is the set of pen thicknesses for technical drawings (0.13, 0.18, 0.25, 0.35, 0.50, 0.70, 1.00, 1.40, and 2.00 mm).\n\nISO 261 defines a set of preferred metric machine screw/bolt sizes, and ISO 262 defines a subset of those; both are based roughly on Renard series as defined in ISO 3, ISO 17, and ISO 497. Given that even ISO 262 specifies a fairly large set of diameters, a much simplified set of preferred diameters was developed by one of the lead designers of ASME Z17.1 and ANSI B4.2, Knut O. Kverneland, to reduce the list to 6 preferred sizes, and another 6 intermediate supplementary sizes.\n\nFor each size bolt or screw and type of head, there is a corresponding size driver prescribed by various ISO standards, including:\n\nFor each size bolt or screw and type of head, there is a corresponding size driver prescribed by Acument, the designer of the Torx drive system. , there are no ISO standards for hexalobular drive sizes.\n\nFor each size bolt or screw and type of head, there is a corresponding size driver prescribed by Acument, the designer of the Torx Plus drive system. , there are no ISO standards for hexalobular drive sizes.\nIf using just the 1st choice bolt sizes, the list of drivers and wrenches needed for all hex and Torx sizes are:\nISO 1307:2006, Rubber and plastics hoses—Hose sizes, minimum and maximum inside diameters, and tolerances on cut-to-length hoses specifies nominal diameters for four different types of plastic hoses, including \"Type C\", which includes the typical garden hose. Each nominal diameter specifies different ID minimum and maximum values. Notice that the nominal size is a Renard Series.\n\nNominal diameter, abbreviated DN, is the designation system specified by ISO 6708 for specifying the diameter of trade sizes of metric pipework components, and is the metric equivalent to Nominal Pipe Size. It is among several ISO specifications that formalize preferred numbers, and is referred to by numerous other international standards, including ISO 7598 and EN 10255. The complete set of DN values allowed by the standard are:\n\nThe number following the DN is a nominal value that is roughly the number of millimeters of a circular feature on the connection point of the pipe, fitting, coupling, etc., but often differing by a noticeable amount. If the DN value is related to the internal bore diameter of the feature, the size should be represented by DN/ID (for Inside Diameter), and if the DN value is related to the outside diameter, the size should be represented by DN/OD (for Outside Diameter).\n\nThe relationship between DN and NPS pipe sizes are as follows. Note that the actual internal diameter varies depending on the pipe wall thickness.\n"}

During the 1990s, Hammam failed in an attempt to relocate the club to Dublin, Ireland.\n\nIn 1997, Hammam sold 80% of his shares in Wimbledon to Bjørn Rune Gjelsten and Kjell Inge Røkke. He sold the remaining 20% to Gjelsten and Røkke in February 2000, three months before the club's relegation from the Premier League. In 2004, Wimbledon F.C. was relocated to Milton Keynes and rebranded as the MK Dons, with the newly formed AFC Wimbledon often considered the successor club to the original Wimbledon.\n\nHammam purchased control of Cardiff City F.C. at the end of 2000, where he picked up where he left off with Wimbledon. After taking over at Cardiff, Hammam controversially pledged to get the entire Welsh nation to support Cardiff by renaming the club \"The Cardiff Celts\" and changing the club colours to green, red and white.\n\nAt Cardiff he became a cult-hero with fans for taking part in their head-patting 'do the Ayatollah' chant. One such game saw him performing the celebration during an infamous 2–1 home win in the FA Cup against then-Premier League side Leeds United in 2002. This, along with other aspects of his behaviour during the match, was blamed for contributing to the subsequent violence between Leeds and Cardiff fans at the end of the match.\n\nAfter failing to get the new stadium plans agreed by Cardiff Council due to concerns over financial security in 2006, Hammam agreed to a takeover by a consortium led by new chairman Peter Ridsdale and including local businessman Paul Guy. In March 2008, Cardiff City began a court case against financial backers Langston over the repayment of a loan believed to be worth around £31 million. During the hearing the barrister representing the club named Sam Hammam as the man they believe to be behind the company. No settlement was reached in the case.\n\nIn July 2013, following Cardiff City's promotion to the Premier League, it emerged that Malaysian businessman Vincent Tan, who had taken effective control of the club in 2010, was in advanced talks with Hammam – confirmed as Langston's spokesman – about repayment of the loan, then thought to be around £24 million. Four days later, on 18 July 2013, Tan announced that an \"amicable resolution\" had been reached between Cardiff City and Langston over the debt issue, with Sam Hammam becoming a life president of the club. Hammam confirmed this in an interview with the BBC on 24 July, requesting that fans of the club back the Malaysian owner.\n\nHammam has achieved a level of notoriety in English football for his unusual antics at matches, frequently walking around the pitchside during games, and his eccentric methods of publicising himself and his players. On at least one occasion he made a player eat sheep's testicles prior to signing with Cardiff City.\n"}

He was Roman Catholic. He received his early education at parochial school in\nMontello, Wisconsin and the Montello High School. He attended Marquette University for one year. He was a welder who became a maintenance\nforeman for A. O. Smith. Schmidt was active in his labor union, serving as chairman of the bargaining and coordinating committees of his local. He was a member of the Knights of Columbus, Fraternal Order of Eagles, Holy Name Society of St. Michael's Church, Badger Fisherman's League, and Montello Rod and Gun Club.\n\nIn the 1948 Democratic primary election for the Sixth Senate District, Schmidt (a former Wisconsin Progressive) won the nomination by 22 votes from incumbent Edward Reuther, and went on to win the general election in a four-way race against Republican Assemblyman Paul Jaeger, as well as a Socialist and a Wallace \"People's Progressive\" candidate. During the 1951 session, he served as assistant floor leader for the Democrats. He was re-elected in 1952; unopposed in his primary, he again defeated Republican Jaeger, whom he had faced in 1948.\n\nSchmidt would remain a member of the Senate through 1956, but did not run for re-election, but instead ran for Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin; Schmidt and gubernatorial running mate William Proxmire lost in the general election. (The man who beat Schmidt for Lieutenant Governor, Warren P. Knowles, would eventually become governor himself). Schmidt was succeeded in the Senate by fellow Democrat William R. Moser.\n"}

To begin with, World-Check's intelligence was used by banks and financial institutions as a comprehensive solution for assessing, managing and remediating risk. However, as legislation has become increasingly complex and its reach has become increasingly global, the demand for such intelligence has grown beyond the financial sector to include organisations from all sectors.\n\nWorld-Check's research team monitors emerging risks in more than 60 languages, covering over 240 countries and territories worldwide. All information used is in the public domain and research analysts profile individuals and entities using open-source research methodology (OSINT) while adhering to strict protocol such as that laid down by the Data Protection Act (UK).\n\nIn 2011, World-Check received independent assurance under the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE 3000) for the internal processes and controls that govern its global sanctions platform and dataset.\n\nA dedicated team of research analysts correlates sanction and embargo lists from around the world, including lists such as OFAC, UK HMT, EU, OSFI, FATF and the Australian DFAT. Regulatory and enforcement lists are monitored as well as lists of debarred and banned parties.\n\nSpecific areas of interest, such as terrorism, organised crime and the Middle East, are covered by specialist research teams.\n\nRegistered in London, World-Check was founded in 2000 by David Leppan to address the risk mitigation requirements of the Swiss banking community. During 2008, World-Check launched Country-Check, an index that ranks over 240 countries and territories worldwide in terms of risk. A statistical algorithm is used to aggregate various information sources across political, financial and criminal factors and this quantifies risk attached to customers and transactions according to their country of origin. Based on statistics and not perception, Country-Check provides practical intelligence for informed decision-making, useful for mergers and acquisitions, security of supply chain, cross border expansion and exploration, and production.\n\nIn 2009 World-Check increased its offering by acquiring IntegraScreen, a provider of enhanced due diligence reporting services. IntegraScreen reports are used when a detailed background check on any entity or individual is required, and research can be carried out no matter where the location.\n\nIn a reddit post, a user declared that he had acquired a copy of the World-Check database with information up to 2014. This leak online apparently was possible due to an incomplete assessment of the security, and was downloaded through the website Shodan, a search engine that lets the user find specific types of computers connected to the internet using a variety of filters, raising questions about the allegedly privacy and security of the service.\n\nIn 2017, World-Check admitted that the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) should never have been placed on their database at all and, specifically, should not have been associated with \"terrorism\", stressing that there were no grounds to suggest that PSC were either associated with terrorism related activity or that the organisation presented any kind of financial risk. The PSC and World-Check have reached an agreement to address the harm done to the reputation of the PSC and its chair, Mr. Hugh Lanning, and to resolve the matters between them arising from that profile.\n\nWorld-Check was forced to pay compensation and apologise to Finsbury Park Mosque in 2017 after falsely claiming that it had a current association with terrorism.\n\nIn 2011, Thomson Reuters acquired World-Check as a key component of their Governance Risk and Compliance (GRC) unit.\n\n\n"}
