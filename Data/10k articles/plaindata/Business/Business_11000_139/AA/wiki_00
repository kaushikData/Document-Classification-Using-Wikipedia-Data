He was a younger brother of former Crown Prince Otto of Austria, who predeceased Felix by two months.\n\nArchduke Felix was born in the Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna the third son of the then heir presumptive to the throne of Austria-Hungary the Archduke Charles and his wife Zita of Bourbon-Parma. He was christened at Schönbrunn on 8 June 1916 in the presence of his great-grand uncle Emperor Franz Joseph while his godfather was his great-uncle King Frederick Augustus III of Saxony, brother of his grandmother Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony. On 21 November 1916 the Emperor Franz Joseph died and Felix's father succeeded as the new Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary.\n\nArchduke Felix was less than three years old when Austria-Hungary collapsed following its defeat in the First World War. As a result, republics were declared in the now-separate countries Austria and Hungary which led to exile of the Imperial Family. Originally exiled in Switzerland the Imperial Family were taken to Portuguese island of Madeira in 1921 after Archduke Felix's father's failed attempts to claim the throne in the Kingdom of Hungary from the regent Miklós Horthy. On 1 April 1922 his father Emperor Charles died in Madeira.\n\nIn the autumn of 1937 Archduke Felix was permitted to return to Austria, entering the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt. He became the first Habsburg since the abolition of the monarchy to pursue a career as an officer in the Austrian Army. With the Anschluss approaching Archduke Felix, his sister Archduchess Adelheid and Archduke Eugen fled Austria crossing the border to Czechoslovakia.\n\nDuring the Second World War while in the United States, Felix and his brother Carl Ludwig volunteered to serve in the 101st Infantry Battalion known as the \"Free Austria Battalion\". However the battalion was disbanded when a number of exiled Jewish volunteers who made up the majority of force ultimately declined to confirm their enlistment.\n\nFelix, unlike his brother Otto, always refused to renounce his rights to the Austrian throne and membership of the Habsburg family, saying that doing so would violate his human rights. As a result, he was banned from entering Austria except for a brief three-day stay in 1989 in order to attend his mother's funeral. On 10 March 1996, after Austria had joined the European Union and the concurrent dropping of staffed border checkpoints between Austria and other EU countries, he crossed into the country from Germany and held a press conference the next day to announce his illegal arrival. After his presence became known, he was warned by the Austrian government that he would face prosecution if he ever tried to enter the country illegally again. Ultimately, a deal was reached between Felix, his brother Carl Ludwig and the Austrian government whereby they declared their allegiance to the republic without any reference being made to their rights to the throne or to their membership in the Imperial Family.\n\nIn June 1998, in a joint action with his brother Carl Ludwig, Felix attempted to have the properties which were given to their ancestor Maria Theresa of Austria by her husband Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor restored to them after the properties had been taken from the Habsburg family by Adolf Hitler during the Anschluss.\n\nFelix built up a number of successful businesses in Mexico and Brussels and worked as a marketing consultant.\n\nDuring his time in exile Archduke Felix lived in Portugal, Belgium, Mexico and the United States. He lived in the \"colonia\" of San Ángel in Mexico City where he died 6 September 2011. He was interred in the family crypt in Muri Abbey, near Zürich. The abbey is a favoured burial place of the Habsburg dynasty, and also contains the remains of his wife and the hearts of his parents.\n\nFelix was married civilly on 18 November 1952 at Beaulieu, France, and religiously a day later, to Princess and Duchess Anna-Eugénie of Arenberg (1925–1997). They had seven children, and twenty-two grandchildren.\n\nAs they all lived in Mexico, and some still do, they are called by the Spanish equivalent to their names.\n\n\nAlong with his brothers Otto and Rudolf, Archduke Felix was a patron for the revived Almanach de Gotha.\n\n"}

It was captured by the German navy during the Venezuelan crisis of 1902–03 and put into service under a German flag as part of the blockading squadron.

{"id": "9034057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9034057", "title": "Atlas Shrugged: Part I", "text": "Atlas Shrugged: Part I\n\nAtlas Shrugged: Part I (referred to onscreen as simply Atlas Shrugged) is a 2011 American political science fiction drama film directed by Paul Johansson. An adaptation of part of Ayn Rand's controversial 1957 novel of the same name, the film is the first in a trilogy encompassing the entire book. After various treatments and proposals floundered for nearly 40 years, investor John Aglialoro initiated production in June 2010. The film was directed by Paul Johansson and stars Taylor Schilling as Dagny Taggart and Grant Bowler as Hank Rearden.\n\nThe film begins the story of \"Atlas Shrugged\", set in a dystopian United States where John Galt leads innovators, from industrialists to artists, in a capital strike, \"stopping the motor of the world\" to reassert the importance of the free use of one's mind and of \"laissez-faire\" capitalism.\n\nDespite near universally negative critical response and commercial failure, grossing just under a fourth of its budget, a sequel, \"\", was released on October 12, 2012, albeit with an entirely different cast. The third installment, \"\", was released on September 12, 2014, again with an overhaul on production.\n\nIn 2016, the United States is in a sustained economic depression. Industrial disasters, resource shortages, and gasoline prices at $37 per gallon have made railroads the primary mode of transportation, but even they are in disrepair. After a major accident on the Rio Norte line of the Taggart Transcontinental railroad, CEO James Taggart shirks responsibility. His sister Dagny Taggart, Vice-President in Charge of Operations, defies him by replacing the aging track with new rails made of Rearden Metal, which is claimed to be lighter yet stronger than steel. Dagny meets with its inventor, Hank Rearden, and they negotiate a deal they both admit serves their respective self-interests.\n\nPolitician Wesley Mouch—nominally Rearden's lobbyist in Washington, D.C.—is part of a crowd that views heads of industry as persons who must be broken or tamed. James Taggart uses political influence to ensure that Taggart Transcontinental is designated the exclusive railroad for the state of Colorado. Dagny is confronted by Ellis Wyatt, a Colorado oil man angry to be forced to do business with Taggart Transcontinental. Dagny promises him that he will get the service he needs. Dagny encounters former lover Francisco d'Anconia, who presents a façade of a playboy grown bored with the pursuit of money. He reveals that a series of copper mines he built are worthless, costing his investors (including the Taggart railroad) millions.\n\nRearden lives in a magnificent home with a wife and a brother who are happy to live off his effort, though they overtly disrespect it. Rearden's anniversary gift to his wife Lillian is a bracelet made from the first batch of Rearden Metal, but she considers it a garish symbol of Hank's egotism. At a dinner party, Dagny dares Lillian to exchange it for Dagny's diamond necklace, which she does.\n\nAs Dagny and Rearden rebuild the Rio Norte line, talented people quit their jobs and refuse all inducements to stay. Meanwhile, Dr. Robert Stadler of the State Science Institute puts out a report implying that Rearden Metal is dangerous. Taggart Transcontinental stock plummets because of its use of Rearden Metal, and Dagny leaves Taggart Transcontinental temporarily and forms her own company to finish the Rio Norte line. She renames it the John Galt Line, in defiance of the phrase \"Who is John Galt?\"—which has come to stand for any question to which it is pointless to seek an answer.\n\nA new law forces Rearden to sell most of his businesses, but he retains Rearden Steel for the sake of his metal and to finish the John Galt Line. Despite strong government and union opposition to Rearden Metal, Dagny and Rearden complete the line ahead of schedule and successfully test it on a record-setting run to Wyatt's oil fields in Colorado. At the home of Wyatt, now a close friend, Dagny and Rearden celebrate the success of the line. As Dagny and Rearden continue their celebration into the night by fulfilling their growing sexual attraction, the shadowy figure responsible for the disappearances of prominent people visits Wyatt with an offer for a better society based on personal achievement.\n\nThe next morning, Dagny and Rearden begin investigating an abandoned prototype of an advanced motor that could revolutionize the world. They realize the genius of the motor's creator and try to track him down. Dagny finds Dr. Hugh Akston, working as a cook at a diner, but he is not willing to reveal the identity of the inventor; Akston knows whom Dagny is seeking and says she will never find him, though he may find her.\n\nAnother new law limits rail freight and levies a special tax on Colorado. It is the final straw for Ellis Wyatt. When Dagny hears that Wyatt's oil fields are on fire, she rushes to the scene of the fire where she finds a handwritten sign nailed to the wall that reads \"I am leaving it as I found it. Take over. It's yours.\"\n\nWyatt declares in an answering machine message that he is \"on strike\".\n\n\nIn 1972, Albert S. Ruddy approached Rand to produce a cinematic adaptation of \"Atlas Shrugged\". Rand agreed that Ruddy could focus on the love story. \"That's all it ever was,\" Rand said. Rand insisted on having final script approval, which Ruddy refused to give her, thus preventing a deal. In 1978, Henry and Michael Jaffe negotiated a deal for an eight-hour \"Atlas Shrugged\" television miniseries on NBC. Jaffe hired screenwriter Stirling Silliphant to adapt the novel and he obtained approval from Rand on the final script. However, in 1979, with Fred Silverman's rise as president of NBC, the project was scrapped.\n\nRand, a former Hollywood screenwriter herself, began writing her own screenplay, but died in 1982 with only one third of it finished. She left her estate, including the film rights to \"Atlas Shrugged\", to her student Leonard Peikoff, who sold an option to Michael Jaffe and Ed Snider. Peikoff would not approve the script they wrote and the deal fell through. In 1992, investor John Aglialoro bought an option to produce the film, paying Peikoff over $1 million for full creative control.\n\nIn 1999, under Aglialoro's sponsorship, Ruddy negotiated a deal with Turner Network Television for a four-hour miniseries, but the project was killed after the AOL Time Warner merger. After the TNT deal fell through, Howard and Karen Baldwin, while running Phillip Anschutz's Crusader Entertainment, obtained the rights. The Baldwins left Crusader, taking the rights to \"Atlas Shrugged\" with them, and formed Baldwin Entertainment Group in 2004. Michael Burns of Lions Gate Entertainment approached the Baldwins to fund and distribute \"Atlas Shrugged\". A two-part draft screenplay written by James V. Hart was re-written into a 127–page screenplay by Randall Wallace, with Vadim Perelman expected to direct. Potential cast members for this production had included Angelina Jolie, Charlize Theron, Julia Roberts, and Anne Hathaway. Between 2009 and 2010, however, these deals came apart, including studio backing from Lions Gate, and therefore none of the stars mentioned above appear in the final film. Also, Wallace did not do the screenplay, and Perelman did not direct. Aglialoro says producers have spent \"something in the $20 million range\" on the project over the last 18 years.\n\nIn May 2010, Brian Patrick O'Toole and Aglialoro wrote a screenplay, intent on filming in June 2010. While initial rumors claimed that the films would have a \"timeless\" setting—the producers say Rand envisioned the story as occurring \"the day after tomorrow\"—the released film is set in late 2016. The writers were mindful of the desire of some fans for fidelity to the novel, but gave some characters, such as Eddie Willers, short shrift and omitted others, such as the composer Richard Halley. The film is styled as a mystery, with black-and-white freeze frames as each innovator goes \"missing\". However, Galt appears and speaks in the film, solving the mystery more clearly than in the first third of the novel.\n\nThough director Johansson had been reported as playing the pivotal role of John Galt, he made it clear in an interview that with regard to \"who is John Galt\" in the film, the answer was, \"Not me.\" He explained that his portrayal of the character would be limited to the first film as a silhouetted figure wearing a trenchcoat and fedora, suggesting that another actor will be cast as Galt for the subsequent parts of the trilogy.\n\nThough Stephen Polk was initially set to direct, he was replaced by Paul Johansson nine days before filming was scheduled to begin. With the 18-year-long option to the films rights set to expire on June 15, 2010, producers Harmon Kaslow and Aglialoro began principal photography on June 13, 2010, thus allowing Aglialoro to retain the motion picture rights. Shooting took five weeks, and he says that the total production cost of the movie came in on a budget around US$10 million, though Box Office Mojo lists the production cost as $20 million.\n\nElia Cmiral composed the score for the film. Peter Debruge wrote in Variety that \"More ambitious sound design and score, rather than the low-key filler from composer Elia Cmiral and music supervisor Steve Weisberg, might have significantly boosted the pic's limited scale.\"\n\nThe film had a very low marketing budget and was not marketed in conventional methods. Prior to the film's release on the politically symbolic date of Tax Day, the project was promoted throughout the Tea Party movement and affiliated organizations such as FreedomWorks. The \"National Journal\" reported that FreedomWorks, the Tea Party-allied group headed by former House Majority Leader Dick Armey, (R-Texas), had been trying to get the movie opened in more theaters. FreedomWorks also helped unveil the \"Atlas Shrugged\" movie trailer at the February 2011 Conservative Political Action Conference. Additionally, it was reported that Tea Party groups across the country were plugging the movie trailer on their websites and Facebook pages. Release of the movie was also covered and promoted by Fox News TV personalities John Stossel and Sean Hannity.\n\nThe U.S. release of \"Atlas Shrugged: Part I\" opened on 300 screens on April 15, 2011, and made US$1,676,917 in its opening weekend, finishing in 14th place overall. Producers announced expansion to 423 theaters several days after release and promised 1,000 theaters by the end of April, but the release peaked at 465 screens. Ticket sales dropped off significantly in its second week of release, despite the addition of 165 screens; after six weeks, the film was showing on only 32 screens and total ticket sales had not crossed the $5 million mark, recouping less than a quarter of the production budget.\n\n\"Atlas Shrugged: Part I\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on November 8, 2011 by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. More than 100,000 DVD inserts were recalled within days due to the jacket's philosophically incorrect description of \"Ayn Rand's timeless novel of courage and self-sacrifice\". As of April 2013, 247,044 DVDs had been sold, grossing $3,433,445.\n\nThe film received overwhelmingly negative reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 11% based on 47 reviews, with an average score of 3.6 out of 10. The site's consensus was: \"Passionate ideologues may find it compelling, but most filmgoers will find this low-budget adaptation of the Ayn Rand bestseller decidedly lacking.\" Metacritic gives the film a \"generally unfavorable\" rating of 28%, as determined by averaging 19 professional reviews. Some commentators noted differences in film critics' reactions from audience members' reactions; from the latter group, the film received high scores even before the film was released.\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film only one star, calling it \"the most anticlimactic non-event since Geraldo Rivera broke into Al Capone's vault.\" Columnist Cathy Young of \"The Boston Globe\" gave the film a negative review. \"Chicago Tribune\" published a predominantly negative review, arguing that the film lacks Rand's philosophical theme, while at the same time saying \"the actors, none of them big names, are well-suited to the roles. The story has drive, color and mystery. It looks good on the screen.\" In the \"New York Post\", Kyle Smith gave the film a mostly negative review, grading it at 2.5/4 stars, criticizing its \"stilted dialogue and stern, unironic hectoring\" and calling it \"stiff in the joints\", but also adding that it \"nevertheless contains a fire and a fury that makes it more compelling than the average mass-produced studio item.\"\n\nReviews in the conservative press were more mixed. American economist Mark Skousen praised the film, writing in \"Human Events\", \"The script is true to the philosophy of Ayn Rand's novel.\" \"The Weekly Standard\" senior editor Fred Barnes noted that the film \"gets Rand's point across forcefully without too much pounding\", that it is \"fast-paced\" when compared with the original novel's 1200-page length, and that it is \"at least as relevant today as it was when the novel was published in 1957.\" Jack Hunter, contributing editor to \"The American Conservative\", wrote, \"If you ask the average film critic about the new movie adaptation of Ayn Rand's \"Atlas Shrugged\" they will tell you it is a horrible movie. If you ask the average conservative or libertarian they will tell you it is a great movie. Objectively, it is a mediocre movie at best. Subjectively, it is one of the best mediocre movies you'll ever see.\" In the \"National Post\", Peter Foster credited the movie for the daunting job of fidelity to the novel, wryly suggested a plot rewrite along the lines of comparable current events, and concluded, \"if it sinks without trace, its backers should at least be proud that they lost their own money.\"\n\nThe poor critical reception of \"Atlas Shrugged: Part I\" initially made Aglialoro reconsider his plans for the rest of the trilogy. In an interview with \"The Hollywood Reporter\", he said he was continuing with plans to produce \"Part II\" and \"Part III\" for release on April 15 in 2012 and 2013, respectively. In a later interview with \"The Boston Globe\", Aglialoro was ambivalent: \"I learned something long ago playing poker. If you think you're beat[en], don't go all in. If \"Part 1\" makes [enough of] a return to support \"Part 2\", I'll do it. Other than that, I'll throw the hand in.\"\n\nIn July 2011, Aglialoro planned to start production of \"\" in September, with its release timed to coincide with the 2012 U.S. elections. In October 2011, producer Harmon Kaslow stated that he hoped filming for \"Part II\" would begin in early 2012, \"with hopes of previewing it around the time of the nominating conventions\". Kaslow anticipated that the film, which would encompass the second third of \"Atlas Shrugged\", would \"probably be 30 to 40 minutes longer than the first movie.\" Kaslow also stated his intent that \"Part II\" would have a bigger production budget, as well as a larger advertising budget.\n\nOn February 2, 2012, Kaslow and Aglialoro, the producers of \"Atlas Shrugged: Part II\", announced a start date for principal photography in April 2012 with a release date of October 12, 2012. Joining the production team was Duncan Scott, who, in 1986, was responsible for creating a new, re-edited version with English subtitles of the 1942 Italian film adaptation of \"We the Living\". The first film's entire cast was replaced for the sequel.\n\nThe sequel film, \"\", was released on October 12, 2012. Critics gave the film a 4% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 23 reviews. One reviewer gave the film a \"D\" rating, while another reviewer gave the film a \"1\" rating (of 4). In naming \"Part II\" to its list of 2012's worst films, \"The A.V. Club\" said \"The irony of \"Part II\"s mere existence is rich enough: The free market is a religion for Rand acolytes, and it emphatically rejected \"Part I\".\"\n\n"}

{"id": "47881336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47881336", "title": "Bates family", "text": "Bates family\n\nThe Bates family is an American political and banking family from Maine and Massachusetts whose members include a prominent member of the prestigious Hell Fire Club, the 26th U.S. Attorney General serving under Abraham Lincoln, the second Governor of Missouri, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives for Arkansas, and a proniment textile tycoon who founded the Bates Manufacturing Company and Bates College in Lewiston, Maine. The family includes various merchants, politicians, inventors, clergymen, artists, and socialites.\n\nThe family is related to the prominent political Gilbert family and indirectly to the Alden family, the first family on the Mayflower.\n\nThe Bates family most likely originated from Lydd in Kent, England. They have lived there since at least the 13th Century.\nThe prominence of the Bates family began with its patriarch, Benjamin Bates I (1651–1710), who worked his way into the legal world as a young boy, in Edinburgh, Scotland, and soon gained a reputation for winning arguments and debates among the most senior councilmen in his town. His rapid ascension through the ranks of the law landed him high paying commissions and high-profile cases, eventually leading him into banking. Little is written about the first Benjamin Bates, and he is most noted for being survived by Benjamin Bates II, is often noted as the \"revival patriarch\" as his life and pursuits landed him in the elite Hellfire Club hosted by Francis Dashwood. Using the considerable sum bestowed upon to him by his father he lived a life of pure excess and began collecting art to soothe his restlessness. Benjamin Bates III, went on to become a prominent merchant of food and working tools. The family can trace their ancestors to John Alden who was crew member on the historic 1620 voyage of the Pilgrim ship \"Mayflower,\" through the union of Elkanah Bates (1779 - 1841) and Hannah Copeland. The family assumed their family crest upon their marriage. Alden's daughter Ruth married John Bass, and were survived by Benjamin, Williams and eventually Hannah Copeland, who began the lineage with the Bates family. The Bates family starts in England but moved to and from Massachusetts periodically, with certain members being born abroad and others being born in New England. Deeply religious the family founded numerous (some now defunct) religious institutions and centers. Alfred Bates fought in the American Revolution as a Captain, and later became a brigadier general for the Massachusetts State Militia.\n\nEdward Bates born in Goochland County, Virginia, on the Bates' Belmont plantation, he was privately tutored at home as a boy. When older, he attended Charlotte Hall Military Academy in Maryland. Bates's first foray into politics came in 1820, with election as a member of the state's constitutional convention. He wrote the preamble to the state constitution—an honor that later influenced his fight against the radical Missouri Constitution of 1865. He next was appointed as the new state's Attorney General. He became a prominent member of the Whig Party during the 1840s, where his political philosophy closely resembled that of Henry Clay. While a slaveholder, during this time, Bates became interested in the case of the slave Polly Berry, who in 1843 gained her freedom decades after having been held illegally in the free state of Illinois for several months. In 1850, President Millard Fillmore asked Bates to serve as U.S. Secretary of War, but he declined. At the Whig National Convention in 1852, Bates was considered for nomination as vice-president on the party ticket, and he led on the first ballot before losing on the second ballot to William Alexander Graham. His brothers Frederick and James Woodson also served in politics as Governor of Missouri, and Senator respectively.\n\nMany descendants of the first Bates members lived modestly off of their inheritances until Elkanah Bates began heavily investing all over the state of Massachusetts serving some clients in Maine, and starting his own cotton factory. His wealth was increased considerably, from cotton brought up from the slave plantations of Alabama, and Mississippi. Elkanah Bates was survived by Benjamin Edward Bates IV, who went on to be one of the most prominent businessmen in the United States and the wealthiest man in Maine for nearly half a century. Benjamin Bates IV was born in Mansfield, Massachusetts on July 12, 1808, to Hannah Copeland and Elkanah Bates as their third child out of eight. The family has historical ties to the Congregational Church, and both of his parents belonged to the local church in Mansfield. He was privately schooled the Wrentham Academy, at 15 and moved to Boston in 1829, at age 21. He soon followed the footsteps of his father and began his early business career. He co-founded the firm of Davis, & Bates in Boston, and his wealth exponentially increased so much so that his overall business engagements quelled the Manhattan panic of 1837's effects in Maine. His principle accomplishment during his early business career was the establishment of Bates Manufacturing Company. The company went on to be the largest manufacturing company in the state of Maine and provided two-thirds of all textile output for the state. It employed approximately five thousand people from Canadian and Irish descent. \n\nAfter being approached by Oren Burbank Cheney, he began offering up the services of his mills, canals, and other holdings in the construction of such an institution. In 1852, he personally pledged another $6,000 to the school. In 1853, Oren Burbank Cheney appointed him as a Trustee of the College and in 1854 subsequently became Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the college due to his considerable donations. He went onto donate $25,000 for the foundation of agriculture department and moved a subscription of $75,000 for campus expansion. On February 21, 1873, he donated $100,000 on the condition that the amount was met by third-party donors, within five years. Although he placed conditions on his donations, he realized his donations regardless of the conditions being met.\n\nBy his death in 1878, Bates' donations to the College totalled over $100,000, and overall contributions valued at $250,000. Cheney renamed the College after Bates without his knowledge.\n\nBates wrote to Cheney and noted the naming of the college after him on May 18, 1863, saying:In regard to the name of your college, I can only say that my choice would have been to name it after someone more worthy of its inception and history... I am sorry the Board of Trustees have renamed the college after me as I cannot raise so much money as people may think I am asking money for myself.By his death in 1878, Bates had amassed a total net worth of approximately $79.4 million (worth $1.7 billion in 2016), and as the richest member of the family. The family possessed assets that included his holdings in Maine, New York, and Massachusetts that encompassed the non-operational value of B. T. Loring & Co., Bates, Turner & Co., his holding company the Bates Manufacturing Company, his stake in the Lewiston Water Company, Bates Mill, and miscellaneous banking endeavors in New York. In his Will he pledged $50,000 to his wife Sarah Gilbert along with his 2.8 million dollar estate, $10,000 to his brother William, $10,000 to his brother Elkanah Bates II, $10,000 equally divided among the children of his sister, Charlotte, $10,000 to Edward Atkinson, and $10,000 to George Fabian. He left each of his children, Benjamin Edward V, Lilian, Sarah, and Author $250,000 in the form of a trust.\n\nHowever, Bates had $200,000 in outstanding debt and a pledged $100,000 to Bates College after his death. His family was required expend the $100,000 pledged but due to conditions placed on the inheritances, restricted distribution, and familial debt, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts eventually ruled that Bates' heirs did not have to pay Bates College the pledged $100,000. After a period of recession the college began to financially recuperate to a larger endowment, independently. Over the next couple of years Bates College's endowment has grown slowly and steadily.\n\nAlthough much has been speculated on the calculated sum of the families wealth many agree it has fallen below Bates' $79.4 million in 1878.\n\nJohn Alden (c.1599 - 1687) m.

Originally developed for data handling and analysis on Data General AOS and AOS/VS minicomputers, then the available platforms for Cyberquery were extended to all major UNIX platforms, VAX/VMS, Digital Equipment Corporation, personal computers and Microsoft Windows. \n\nInvented in 1980, Cyberquery is a declarative \"4GL\" fourth-generation programming language. Its early design was slightly influenced by RAMIS and other data access and analysis languages such as the query language on GE time sharing systems. Cyberquery automates the process of accessing files or tables and reading records or rows. This basic operation allows the user/developer to concentrate on the details of working with the data within each record, in effect working almost entirely within an implicit program loop that runs for each record. Compared to general-purpose programming languages, this automation allows the user/developer to ignore the technical details of the data and how it is stored, and concentrate on the information contained in the data.\n\nCyberquery has a data dictionary to describe the datasets users wish to access. This removes all the physical details of the file structure from each program and from the user/developer. The original target customers for Cyberquery were personnel departments, so ease of use by non computer specialists was an early design goal. This architecture had the advantage that Cyberquery is portable, reports written for one database run unmodified on any other provided the underlying data is logically similar. Differences are hidden in the data dictionary. Cyberquery is now widely deployed in Industries including Manufacturing, Finance, Medical and Retail.\n\n"}

In 1997 he co-founded the creative agency St. Luke’s. Abraham then went on to senior creative roles at Discovery Communications in the UK and the US before becoming CEO of UKTV in 2007 and then CEO of Channel 4 from 2010 to 2017.\n\nAbraham was born in Lincolnshire. Both his parents immigrated to the UK in the 1950s – his mother from Belgium and his father from Calcutta. He moved with his parents and sister to Essex in the 1970s where he attended local state schools, before going to Oxford University in 1981 to study Modern History at Magdalen College.\n\nAbraham began his working life at the advertising agency Benton & Bowles in London in 1984. He moved to the creative agency Collett Dickenson Peace (CDP) and worked with Indra Sinha and Neil Godfrey. In 1990 he moved to the London office of the Californian creative agency Chiat/Day – launched by MT Rainey.\n\nIn 1995, Jay Chiat sold his agency network to Omnicom with the intention to globally merge Chiat/Day with TBWA. In the UK, client conflicts prompted an employee buy-out of the business, led by Andy Law and Abraham, who became Chief Operating Officer. St. Luke's has been featured in Law's book Open Minds, in the Harvard Business Review and in a Channel 4 Cutting Edge Documentary.\n\nAbraham became the general manager of Discovery Networks Europe in 2001.\n\nAbraham became general manager of TLC in 2005, a US cable channel available in over 90m US households.\n\nIn 2007, Abraham became the chief executive of UKTV. At the time UKTV was a joint venture between BBC Worldwide and Virgin Media. During his tenure, he oversaw launches of Dave, Alibi, Watch, Yesterday and Really.\n\nAbraham succeeded interim chief executive Anne Bulford in May 2010 following a period of relative uncertainty at Channel 4 involving a debate about the organisation's self-sufficiency, leading to what was described as a 'public begging bowl' strategy. Abraham was appointed by incoming chairman Lord Terry Burns.\n\nAbraham became immediately involved in programming issues such as whether Jonathan Ross should return, and in defending a controversial Frankie Boyle sketch about Katie Price's family.\n\nAbraham assembled a new leadership team including appointing Jay Hunt from BBC One as chief creative officer to revive programming. Over the next few years, Channel 4's programmes included \"24 Hours in A&E\", \"The 2012 Paralympic Games\", \"The Grand National\", \"Black Mirror\", \"Gogglebox\", \"The Last Leg\", \"Humans\", \"The Undateables\", \"Educating Yorkshire\", \"The Island\", \"Indian Summers\", \"Southcliffe\", \"UKIP; The First 100 Days\", \"Sri Lanka's Killing Fields\", \"Benefits Street\", \"Big Fat Gypsy Weddings\" and \"MPs For Hire\".\n\nIn 2010 and 2014, Channel 4 was named Channel of the Year at the Edinburgh International Television Festival, and by \"Broadcast\" magazine in 2016.\n\nIn late 2015, Abraham and Hunt struck a three-year deal with Bernie Ecclestone to broadcast Formula One on Channel 4. In early 2015, Channel 4 launched new online hub All 4, offering live streaming, shortform and 'box-set' content, and replacing 4oD. In early 2016, a new foreign language drama service called Walter Presents was launched on All 4.\n\nAbraham increased funding for Film4 in 2010 and again in 2016 and the film division led by Tessa Ross and subsequently David Kosse. In 2016 Abraham appointed Daniel Battsek to lead Film 4 following the leaving of David Kosse to join STX.\n\nIn 2010, Abraham and Burns pursued a bid to acquire Channel 5. This was ultimately secured by Richard Desmond's Northern and Shell.\n\nAbraham's other business initiatives at Channel 4 have included: a new advertising sales partnership with UKTV (and later, BT Sport). A new on-line data strategy which has over 13 million registered users across the UK and the launch of 4seven. In 2011 Abraham hired Jonathan Allen as Sales Director who built a team than won Sales Team of the Year in 2015.\n\nDan Brooke also joined the Channel 4 as director of marketing and communications and then Chief Marketing and Communications Officer. Channel 4’s in-house agency 4Creative have created campaigns such as \"Meet The Superhumans\" in 2012 and the rebranding of Channel 4 in 2015 created by the film-maker Jonathan Glazer.\n\nIn June 2017, it was announced that Abraham would leave later that year and would be succeeded by Alex Mahon as the CEO of Channel 4. Mahon formally took over the role in October 2017.\n\nIn April 2018, Abraham announced the launch of a new company, Wonderhood Studios. The stated aims of the business are to forge a new model in the creative industries by bringing together skills and capabilities that until now have operated separately. The new company will be structured in the form of adjacent studios: one will produce ambitious programming across multiple genres for broadcasters and platforms while another will serve as a full-strength creative agency for major brands. Both studios will be supported by a third specialism in media data insight and the development of future digital networks. \n\nIn May 2011, Abraham set out his planned vision for Channel 4 at a Royal Television Society event in which he stressed the importance of its organisational independence and how it would keep innovating both editorially and technologically. On the occasion of the 30th Anniversary of Channel 4 in 2012, he delivered a speech at the Freeword Centre London entitled: Freedom of Expression and Free Television.\n\nIn 2013 Abraham chaired the Royal Television Society Cambridge Convention during which he announced a new £20m Growth Fund for UK independent production companies. This fund has invested in companies such as Lightbox, True North, Arrow, Eleven Films and production entities involving Sacha Baron Cohen and David Coulthard.\n\nIn 2014, Abraham delivered the MacTaggart Lecture at the Edinburgh International Television Festival. The theme of the lecture addressed the continuing importance of public service broadcasting in the UK in an age of global and technological consolidation. The lecture caused debate within the media industry and was characterised by some as a critique of American ownership of UK media assets.\n\nFollowing the May 2015 general election, Abraham, together with Channel 4 chairman Terry Burns, has spoken out about the potential threats to public service broadcasting and to the UK creative economy in the event of the privatisation of Channel 4.\n\nAbraham is a Vice President of the Royal Television Society, a member of BAFTA and has sat on the board of Creative Skillset since 2008.\n\nAbraham lives in London, is a father to two adult children and partner to Tiina Lee, Head of Global Markets and Deputy Chief Executive for Deutsche Bank UK.\n\n"}
{"id": "175549", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=175549", "title": "Dilbert principle", "text": "Dilbert principle\n\nThe Dilbert principle is a concept in management developed by Scott Adams, creator of the comic strip \"Dilbert\", which states that companies tend to systematically promote incompetent employees to management to get them out of the workflow. The Dilbert principle is inspired by the Peter principle, which holds that employees are promoted based on success in their current position until they reach their \"level of incompetence\" and are no longer promoted. Under the Dilbert principle, employees who were never competent are promoted to management to limit the damage they can do. Adams first explained the principle in a 1995 \"Wall Street Journal\" article, and expanded upon it in his 1996 business book \"The Dilbert Principle\".\n\nIn the \"Dilbert\" strip of February 5, 1995, Dogbert says that \"leadership is nature's way of removing morons from the productive flow\". Adams himself explained,\nI wrote \"The Dilbert Principle\" around the concept that in many cases the least competent, least smart people are promoted, simply because they’re the ones you don't want doing actual work. You want them ordering the doughnuts and yelling at people for not doing their assignments—you know, the easy work. Your heart surgeons and your computer programmers—your smart people—aren't in management. That principle was literally happening everywhere.\n\nAdams explained the principle in a 1995 \"Wall Street Journal\" article. Adams then expanded his study of the Dilbert principle in his 1996 book \"The Dilbert Principle\", which is required or recommended reading at some management and business programs. In the book, Adams writes that, in terms of effectiveness, use of the Dilbert principle is akin to a band of gorillas choosing an alpha-squirrel to lead them. The book has sold more than a million copies and was on the \"New York Times\" bestseller list for 43 weeks.\n\nAdams' presentation of the principle is satirical—facetious but also addressing a real-world concern.\n\nThe Dilbert principle is comparable to the Peter principle. As opposed to the Dilbert principle, the Peter principle assumes that people are promoted because they are competent, and that the tasks higher up in the hierarchy require skills or talents they do not possess. It concludes that due to this, a competent employee will eventually be promoted to, and then remain at, a position at which he or she is incompetent. In his book, \"The Peter Principle\", Laurence J. Peter explains \"percussive sublimation\", the act of kicking a person upstairs (i.e., promoting him to management) to get him out of the way of productive employees.\n\nThe Dilbert principle, by contrast, assumes that hierarchy just serves as a means for removing the incompetent to \"higher\" positions where they will be unable to cause damage to the workflow, assuming that the upper echelons of an organization have little relevance to its actual production, and that the majority of real, productive work in a company is done by people lower in the power ladder. Unlike the Peter principle, the promoted individuals were not particularly good at any job they previously held, so placing them in a supervisory position is a way to quietly remove them from the workforce without actually firing them, rather than a reward for meritorious service. An earlier formulation of this effect was known as Putt's Law.\n\n"}

Both parents had emigrated from Ireland to Canada as children, accompanying their parents.\n\nHe became a farmer and a businessman with little success. He moved to California with his father in 1878 in hopes of finding gold. Instead, Kepple was convinced by an agent of the Union Pacific Railroad to buy of land near Ellis, Kansas. Disney was an ardent socialist and a supporter of Eugene Debs.\n\nIn Ellis, Elias attempted to live as an orange grower and failed.\n\nDisney worked on his father's new farm until 1884, when he left to find another job. He was hired in a railroad machine shop (one of his co-workers was Walter Chrysler), then he joined the railroad crew building the Union Pacific line through Colorado. After the railroad contract was over, he became a professional fiddle player in Denver. Again he was unsuccessful, and he returned to his father's farm. He also worked for a short time as a mailman in Kissimmee, Florida, close to the eventual site of Walt Disney World. Disney did also attempt to make a career as an orange grower in Florida, but he was unsuccessful As one can see from his attempts at being self-employed, Elias had entrepreneurial tendencies—tendencies that his son, Walt, later would inherit and develop.\n\nHe was a construction worker for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, an event which author Erik Larson cites as a source of inspiration for his son Walt and the Disney kingdom he would eventually create. He bought shares of O-Zell Company, a jelly-canning factory that also produced apple juice in Chicago, where his son Walt Disney worked before he joined the Red Cross Ambulance Corps in World War I.\n\nDisney married Flora Call on January 1, 1888, in Kismet, Lake County, FL north of the land on which Walt Disney World would eventually be built and lived for a short time in adjoining Acron, Florida. She was the daughter of his father's neighbors.\n\nSoon after marriage, the Disneys moved to Chicago, Illinois, where Elias met and befriended Walter Parr, St. Paul Congregational Church's preacher for whom the Disneys' fourth son, Walt, was named. Elias' son Raymond Arnold Disney named his son Charles Elias Disney after his father Elias Charles Disney.\n\nThe couple had five children:\n\nBy 1890, the Disneys lived at 3515 South Vernon Avenue in the Fourth Ward. Elias worked as a carpenter. On October 31, 1891, Elias bought a lot at 1249 Tripp. By 1892 he built a house on it. The neighborhood was called Hermosa and had been settled by Scottish, German, and Scandinavian immigrants. Their younger three children were born there. \n\nBy the turn of the century, Elias had become an active building contractor. He built houses which he owned and then resold. He also built the Saint Paul Congregational Church, a building dedicated on October 14, 1900. Elias was one of the church's trustees, while his wife was its treasurer.\n\nAccording to some sources, Disney worried about the rising criminality of the city. A neighboring family had two adolescent children involved in a car barn robbery, and Elias feared that crime would taint his own children. In 1906 he moved with his family to a farm near Marceline, Missouri. Elias and his family settled there in April, 1906. On March 5, he bought a farm. Its previous owner William E. Crane had died in November, 1905. Crane was a veteran of the American Civil War and his house predated the foundation of Marceline. He bought the farm for $3,000 or $75 per acre. On April 3, Elias bought an adjoining tract of about from Crane's widow. He paid an additional $450.\n\nMarceline was probably chosen for being accessible from Chicago, for its rural setting, and because his younger brother Robert owned a farm west of the city. The Crane Farm had orchards of apples, peaches, and plums, and fields of grain. The farm animals included pigs, chickens, horses, and cows. The Disneys had a telephone connection by 1907. Herbert and Raymond Disney never liked life on the farm. They moved out around the fall of 1908, heading back to Chicago. They found work as clerks.\n\nIn 1907, Elias convinced some of his fellow farmers to join the American Society of Equity, a farmer's union aiming to consolidate the members' buying power.\n\nThe family sold the farm on November 28, 1910, as Elias fell ill. He was suffering from typhoid fever, followed by pneumonia. The Disneys lived in a rented house in Marceline, probably at 508 North Kansas Avenue. Until 1911, when they moved to Kansas City, Missouri. They lived in a rented house at 2706 East Thirty-first Street. They stayed there until they bought their own modest home in September, 1914. It was situated at 3028 Bellefontaine Street.\n\nOn July 1, 1911, Elias purchased a newspaper delivery route for \"The Kansas City Star\". It extended from the Twenty-seventh Street to the Thirty-first Street, and from Prospect Avenue to Indiana Avenue. Roy and Walt were put to work delivering the newspapers. The Disneys delivered the morning newspaper \"Kansas City Times\" to about 700 customers and the evening and Sunday \"Star\" to more than 600. Their customers increased with time. Elias also delivered butter and eggs to his newspaper customers. They were imported from a dairy farm in Marceline.\n\nElias sold the paper route on March 17, 1917. He had been investing in the O-Zell Company of Chicago since 1912 and moved back to the city in 1917 to take an active role in its management. The Disneys rented a flat at 1523 Ogden Avenue.\n\nHe retired from management work in 1920 and moved back to Kansas City. He was again listed as a carpenter. He moved to Portland, Oregon by the fall (autumn September–October) of 1921. His son Herbert had earlier moved to this city.\n\nDisney was a member of the Congregational Church and often preached stern sermons on Sundays in this church. His son, Walter Elias Disney, was named after a Congregationalist minister named Walter Parr. Walt's middle name was after his father, Elias Charles Disney. Elias and Walt had a tense relationship as Elias never saw Walt's profession as an artist as a real job. Elias' son Raymond Arnold Disney named his son Charles Elias Disney after his father Elias Charles Disney. Elias never drank alcohol and rarely smoked. According to biographical accounts, Disney was a stern man who could have a strong temper at times, and would take the money his sons earned for \"safekeeping\", considering them too young to know the value of money. If his children misbehaved, Elias would not hesitate to punish them with a switch.\n\nElias would talk socialism with strange characters and bring them home. He was a fiddler and would bring home anyone else who could play an instrument.\n\n"}

He is famous for founding and managing the biggest department store in Tórshavn, SMS, and is also recognised for his contribution in introducing trade and business terminology into the Faroese language. Between 1963 and 1976 he was a driving force in developing elite handball in the Faroe Islands.\n\nMortensen was born and raised in Tórshavn in the Faroe Islands. He is the son of business owners Niels Gustav Mortensen (1913 – 1987) and Ebba Mortensen (1920 – 2000), who each ran trading businesses in one of the older trading quarters of Tórshavn between 1952 and 1990. In 1964, he married Birgit Mortensen (née Sivertsen), and together they had a daughter, Elisabeth Mortensen and a son, Niels Mortensen. Niels Mortensen took over as CEO of SMS after his father stepped down from the position in 1996, and as a member of its board after Mortensen retired in 2007. After being a widower since 2001, Mortensen remarried in 2007 with Marjun á Plógv.\n\nAfter completing primary and secondary school, Mortensen received his Upper Secondary diploma from Føroya Millum- og Realskúli and took on an apprenticeship at Føroya Banki (now BankNordik). In 1967, Mortensen graduated from the Niels Brock business school in Copenhagen and shortly after started working at the Magasin du Nord department store on Kongens Nytorv in Copenhagen. After two years at the department store, Mortensen returned to the Faroe Islands to found his own business and improve the lagging business conditions in the country.\n\nMortensen’s life-long commitment to Faroese elite handball began in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1963, at the age of 18, Mortensen became the president of the Tórshavn handball club Neistin and immediately initiated the construction of a club venue, completed in the following year. The venue was crucial to the club’s subsequent popularity and success. In 1964, Mortensen played on the first Faroese men’s national handball team. In 1976, Mortensen was head coach for the men’s national handball team when they achieved good results during the Men’s Handball World Championship 1976 Group C in Portugal.\n\nAfter completing his education in Denmark, Mortensen ran his own retail business in his parents’ premises in central Tórshavn. But in 1970, Mortensen organised the first of many trade fairs in the Faroe Islands. A few attempts had been made earlier at arranging similar events in 1968 in Klaksvík. The popularity of the trade fairs showed that demand for the Faroese market was bigger than the market was capable of supplying at the time.\n\nMost businesses were located in central Torshavn, and increasing traffic and construction was causing congestion. Tórshavn's city council was therefore planning to establish a shopping street as an extension of a new pharmacy at the outskirts of the city centre to divert some of the traffic.\n\nUpon learning of the city plans and the reasons behind them, Mortensen suggested privatising the project in order to further promote business. After initial internal disputes, Mortensen was granted permission to build his department store, which would enable customers to run various errands in a single location.\n\nMortensen hired Danish architect Flemming Hansen to design a progressive department store, whose architecture would still be rooted in traditional Faroese building style. Construction began in 1976, and the department store SMS opened to the public on November 2nd, 1977. Mortensen was CEO of SMS from 1976 to 1996 and majority shareholder until 2007, when he sold all his shares to his son Niels Mortensen. Niels Mortensen has since then developed the business further. Today the SMS Group includes three shopping centers, three chain stores, a number of partnerships and a microbiological laboratory.\n\nMortensen’s visions have been characterised by both progressiveness and traditionalism. The department store SMS was designed to resemble traditional Faroese boathouses, and Faroese shop names and business terminology was developed by taking into account common citizen and customer opinions, often through public naming competitions. Over time, the previous predominately Danish business terminology was replaced by newly created Faroese terminology, which continues to evolve with the introduction of new terms and technology.\n\nIn an effort to combine innovation with historic preservation, Mortensen collaborated with architects Gunnar Hoydal, Mette Skjold, and Ósbjørn Jacobsen in 2012 to create a public proposal on how to continue developing the Tórshavn city centre while maintaining its historic features.\n\nOn International Mother Language Day in 2015, Mortensen received the Faroese Mother Language Award for his longstanding contribution to society and language, particularly his innovative approaches to Faroese trade and business.\n\n"}

Magnetic separation was typically limited and moderately effective. Magnetic separators that used permanent magnets could generate fields of low intensity only. These worked well in removing ferrous tramp but not fine paramagnetic particles. Thus high-intensity magnetic separators that were effective in collecting paramagnetic particles came into existence. These focus on the separation of very fine particles that are paramagnetic.\n\nThe current is passed through the coil, which creates a magnetic field, which magnetizes the expanded steel matrix ring. The paramagnetic matrix material behaves like a magnet in the magnetic field and thereby attracts the fines. The ring is rinsed when it is in the magnetic field and all the non-magnetic particles are carried with the rinse water. Next as the ring leaves the magnetic zone the ring is flushed and a vacuum of about – 0.3 bars is applied to remove the magnetic particles attached to the matrix ring.\n\nHigh-gradient magnetic separator is to separate magnetic and non-magnetic particles (concentrate and tails) from the feed slurry. This feed comes from intermediate thickener underflow pump through Linear Screen & Passive Matrix. Tailings go to tailing thickener & product goes to throw launder through vacuum tanks.\n\nIon separation is another application of magnetic separation. The separation is driven by the magnetic field that induces a separating force. The force differentiate then between heavy and lighter ions causing the separation. This phenomenon has been demonstrated on test bench and pilot scale.\n"}

He was a founding trustee and the first overseer of Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nBorn in Carlisle, Cumbria, England, Carlyle was the second surviving son of William Carlyle, an apothecary-surgeon, of a landed Scottish family from Dumfrieshire descended from the Lords Carlyle of Torthorwald and Rachel Murray of Murraythwaite, Dumfriesshire. He immigrated to Virginia in 1741 as a factor (agent) of English merchant William Hicks. He established himself as a merchant at Belhaven, a settlement that had grown up around a tobacco warehouse on the bluff overlooking the Potomac River that would become Alexandria, Virginia, in 1749.\n\nCarlyle quickly met with financial success and, in 1747, married Sarah Fairfax, cousin of Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, from one of the most influential families in Virginia. From 1751–53, he built his house, now Carlyle House, in Alexandria and he also owned thousands of acres of land throughout Virginia, including three plantations. His business ventures included trading with England and the West Indies, retail operations in Alexandria, a foundry in the Shenandoah Valley, milling, and operation of a forge. He also undertook a number of civic and religious positions typical of a man of his status.\nOn 26 January 1754, he was appointed by Virginia's Lieutenant Governor Robert Dinwiddie, major and commissary of the Virginia forces in the French and Indian War. He was politically well-connected at the time and was friends with future President of the United States George Washington. In 1755, Carlyle's house was the initial headquarters for Major-General Edward Braddock in Virginia during the French and Indian War. The Congress of Alexandria convened at the house, most likely in the dining room, and here Braddock decided to make an expedition to Fort Duquesne which would result in his death. He was urged not to undertake the expedition by Washington who was then a volunteer \"aide-de-camp\" to Braddock.\n\nFollowing the death of his wife Sarah on 22 January 1761, Carlyle married Sybil West, daughter of prominent Alexandrian Hugh West.\n\nAround 1770, Caryle constructed a plantation house and summer residence in what is now Fairlington, Arlington, Virginia first called Torthorwald (after his family's ancestral home in Scotland) and later changed to Morven (a mythical land of the Gaels in an Ossian poem) which stood until 1942. He used this plantation as a stud farm and operated a grist mill on Four Mile Run above what is now Arlandria.\n\nCarlyle died in 1780 and is buried at the Old Presbyterian Meeting House in Alexandria.\n\nJohn Carlyle's only son to survive beyond childhood was George William Carlyle, born in 1766. He served in the cavalry (3rd Continental Light Dragoons under Lt. Col. William Washington, a cousin of George Washington) and was killed in South Carolina in the American Revolutionary War Battle of Eutaw Springs on 8 September 1781 at age 15, less than one year after the death of his father. John Carlyle's grandson through his daughter Sarah Carlyle, John Carlyle Herbert, inherited Carlyle House in 1781. Had George William Carlyle lived, he would have been entitled to the dormant barony as Lord Carlyle, after the death of his first cousin Joseph Dacre Carlyle who died without a son in 1804.\n\n"}

{"id": "11418059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11418059", "title": "Law practice management", "text": "Law practice management\n\nLaw practice management (LPM) is the management of a law practice. In the United States, law firms may be composed of a single attorney, of several attorneys, or of many attorneys, plus support staff such as paralegals/legal assistants, secretaries (including legal secretaries), and other personnel.\n\nDebate over law as a profession versus a business has occurred for over a century; a number of observers believe that it is both.\n\nLaw practice management is the study and practice of business administration in the legal context, including such topics as workload and staff management; financial management; office management; and marketing, including legal advertising.\n\nMany lawyers have commented on the difficulty of balancing the management functions of a law firm with client matters.\n\nLawyers started practicing centuries ago. Law firms as an institution date back to the 19th century, and in the United States began appearing in the period before the Civil War. predating the development of modern management theory.\n\nToday, the George Washington University College of Professional Studies (CPS) offers a Master of Professional Studies and Graduate Certificate in Law Firm Management.\n\nThe leading organization focused on law practice management is the Law Practice Division of the American Bar Association which traces its history back to the creation of the ABA Special Committee on Economics of Law Practice by the ABA Board of Governors on July 30, 1957. In August 1957, when Charles S. Rhyne became President of the ABA, he made one of his major objectives the institution of a “comprehensive program to aid members of the ABA in the field of economics of law practice”. He appointed the first Committee which consisted of five members and was increased in May of the following year to seven by action of the Board. The first Chair of the Special Committee was John C. Satterfield of Yazoo City, Mississippi.\n\nThe Committee was charged with the duty of laying the groundwork for the development of practical suggestions to lawyers, designed to improve their economic status. Combined with this, there was to be an increase in coordination of assistance to lawyers in the business phase of the practice of law, achieved by ABA through its staff, committees and sections and by the state and local bar associations.\n\nAn early publication from the Committee was \"The 1958 Lawyer and His 1938 Dollar\". Satterfield was elected President of the American Bar Association in 1961 during which \"The Lawyers Handbook\" was first published and distributed to all attorneys who joined the ABA that year.\n\nBy action of the Board of Governors at the ABA Annual Meeting in August 1961, the Special Committee was made a standing committee of the Association and Lewis F. Powell of Richmond, Virginia, was appointed as the first Chair of the ABA Standing Committee on Economics of Law Practice. Shortly after the completion of his term as Chair in 1962, he was elected President of the American Bar Association and subsequently became an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court in 1972.\n\nThe Standing Committee on Economics of Law Practice published a bimonthly newsletter, Legal Economics News, and more than 30 books and pamphlets, three educational films, and an audio cassette program. The Committee continued to publish The Lawyer’s Handbook. The Committee’s staff answered over one hundred inquiries a month from attorneys regarding the application of sound management principles to the law office operation. In addition, a small group of attorneys led by J. Harris Morgan of Greenville, Texas, Kline Strong of Salt Lake City, Utah, Lee Turner of Great Bend, Kansas and Jimmy Brill of Houston, Texas, traveled throughout the US, presenting programs on law firm management. Their efforts created the need for the Section.\n\nCommencing in 1965 when John D. Connor served as Chair, the Committee presented the first of six National Conferences of Law Office Economics and Management in Chicago, which attracted approximately 500 lawyers throughout the country and several foreign countries.\n\nAs activities expanded and lawyer interest in law office management increased, it became apparent that the committee structure could not meet the demonstrated need of American lawyers for assistance in law practice issues and limited the participation and contribution of interested and informed lawyers in the vital economics and efficiency programs of the Association. Accordingly, two members of the Committee, Robert S. Mucklestone of Seattle, Washington, the former Chair of the Young Lawyers Section, and Richard A. Williams of Little Rock, Arkansas were joined by William J. Fuchs of Haverford, Pennsylvania; John “Buddy” Thomason of Memphis, Tennessee; and Robert P. Wilkins of Columbia, South Carolina, and commenced efforts to form a section to address the subject of law office economics and management.\n\nProponents for a new Section originally proposed that the Board of Governors recommend to the House the creation of a Section of Law Office Practice and Efficiency, but after deliberation it was determined that the new Section should be called by the Standing Committee name. At the ABA Midyear Meeting in Houston, Texas in February 1974, the House of Delegates approved establishing the Section of Economics of Law Practice. This action culminated a two-year effort to expand the Committee’s work to a much wider lawyer population.\n\nThe organizational meeting of the Section was held in April 1974 at the close of the Sixth National Conference of Law Office Economics and Management. Robert S. Mucklestone of Seattle Washington, who had served as the Chair of the ABA Committee on Economics of Law Practice was elected the new Section chair with 1074 charter members. Those chosen to serve on the initial Section Council were selected from the members of the ABA Committee on Economics of Law Practice and the Committee on Legal Assistants, other ABA contacts, speakers from the National Conferences and attorneys active at the state level.\n\nThe current chair of the American Bar Association Law Practice Division is Tom Bolt, a St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands lawyer with BoltNagi PC.\n\nThe Association of Legal Administrators (ALA) professional association, which was founded in 1971 is another organization that is concerned with law practice management.\n\nA large number of law practice consulting firms also exist. Many bar associations have a law practice section or division which they allow non-attorney members due to the technical, non-legal basis of law office management.\n\nLaw practice management includes management of people (clients, staff, vendors), workplace facilities and equipment, internal processes and policies, and financial matters such as collection, budgeting, financial controls, payroll, and client trust accounts.\n\nSoftware applications have become increasingly important in modern law practice. Picking the best software for a law office depends on many variables.\n\nPractice management software, a form of customer relationship management software, is among the most important, and features and functions of such management software often include case management (databases, conflict of interest checking, statute of limitations checking), time tracking (for billing), document assembly, contact management, and calendaring and docket. Other software used includes password security, disk encryption, mindmapping, desktop notes, word processing, and email management. Some firms use modified versions of open source software.\n\nMost law firms also subscribe to a computer-assisted legal research database for legal research. Such databases provide case law from case reporters, and often other legal resources. The two largest legal databases are Westlaw (part of West, which is owned by Thomson Reuters) and LexisNexis, but other databases also exist, such the free Google Scholar, and the newer Bloomberg Law, as well as Loislaw (operated by Wolters Kluwer) and several smaller databases.\n\nDocument automation has also become a crucial part of legal practice management, with companies like Thomson Reuters, HotDocs (acquired by AbacusNext) and HelpSelf Legal (web-based platform) providing document automation services that allow lawyers to customize their own interview workflows to merge into legal documents. These and other sites are incorporating artificial intelligence into their document automation software.. \n\nThese document automation tools allow any lawyer to create their own workflows, in the same way that companies like LegalZoom and RocketLawyer offer standardized automated document production for individuals and small businesses.. Some bar associations and lawyers' organizations have their own software; for example, the American Academy of Estate Planning Attorneys' CounselPro program is designed for estate planning lawyers and assists in producing wills, trusts, and other legal documents, as well as other documents such as thank-you letters.\n\nHuman resource management (managing personnel) is an important aspect of law practice management, and many books and other resources offer advice to firms on this topic.\n\nLaw firms often employ a number of non-legal personnel or support staff; according to one figure, the average attorney to non-attorney ratio is 1 to 1.3.\n\nMany firms and other organizations employ a professional non-attorney legal administrator, or law firm administrator, to manage non-attorney personnel and the administrative aspects of the firm. The professional association for legal administrators is the Association of Legal Administrators (ALA), founded in 1971. Over the past two decades, the role of legal administrator has changes as duties have expanded and become more complex, and as more firms hired administrators; the ALA grew from less than a thousand members in 1976 to over 8,000 in 1995. According to the ALA, in 2007 some 76 percent of legal administrators were women in their 40s and 50s. The main duties of legal administrators are the financial, operation, and human resource management of the firm.\n\nA legal administrator is similar to an office manager or executive director, but often with some expanded duties. Depending on the size, needs, and type of law firm, the firm may employ a separate database manager, network administrator, marketing director, computer systems or information technology manager, bookkeeper, accounts payable and accounts receivable clerk, and others.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is located in the Civic Center district of downtown Los Angeles in the city block bounded by Main, Temple, First, and Spring streets.\n\nThe building was designed by John Parkinson, John C. Austin, and Albert C. Martin, Sr., and was completed in 1928. Dedication ceremonies were held on April 26, 1928. It has 32 floors and, at high, is the tallest base-isolated structure in the world, having undergone a seismic retrofit from 1998 to 2001 so that the building will sustain minimal damage and remain functional after a magnitude 8.2 earthquake. The concrete in its tower was made with sand from each of California's 58 counties and water from its 21 historical missions. City Hall's distinctive tower was based on the shape of the Mausoleum of Mausolus, and shows the influence of the Los Angeles Public Library, completed shortly before the structure was begun. An image of City Hall has been on Los Angeles Police Department badges since 1940.\n\nTo keep the City's architecture harmonious, prior to the late 1950s the Charter of the City of Los Angeles did not permit any portion of any building other than a purely decorative tower to be more than . Therefore, from its completion in 1928 until 1964, the City Hall was the tallest building in Los Angeles, and shared the skyline with only a few structures having decorative towers, including the Richfield Tower and the Eastern Columbia Building.\n\nCity Hall has an observation deck, free to the public and open Monday through Friday during business hours. The peak of the pyramid at the top of the building is an airplane beacon named in honor of Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh, cf Lindbergh Beacon. Circa 1939, there was an art gallery, in Room 351 on the third floor, that exhibited paintings by California artists.\n\nThe building was designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1976.\n\nIn 1998 the building was closed during a total $135 million refurbishment which also included upgrading it so it could withstand a magnitude 8.2 earthquake including permitting it to sway in a quake.\n\nPrior to the completion of the current structure, the L.A. City Council utilized various other buildings:\n\n\nThe Mayor of Los Angeles has an office in room 300 of this building and every Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday at 10:00am, the Los Angeles City Council meets in its chamber. City Hall and the adjacent federal, state, and county buildings are served by the Civic Center station on the LA Metro Red Line and Purple Line. The Silver Line stops in front of the building.\n\nAn observation level is open to the public on the 27th floor. The interior of this floor, comprises a single large and highly vaulted room distinguished by the iconic tall square columns that are far more familiar as one of the building's most distinguishing exterior features. The Mayor Tom Bradley Room, as this large interior space is named, is used for ceremonies and other special occasions.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers will wear a commemorative uniform patch during the 2018 season celebrating 60 years in the city depicting a logo of Los Angeles City Hall.\n\nThe building has been featured in the following popular movies and television shows:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Szombatfalvy fled to Sweden in 1956 following the Hungarian uprising of that year. He arrived with two empty hands and worked initially in a variety of jobs including as a magician in the refugee camps, before gradually becoming interested in the stock market. His interest in stock led to his development of a method of risk calculation for investments for which he became well known on the Swedish stock market. In the late 1980s his interests turned toward entirely different matters and he withdrew from the market. Over the past couple of years his attention has focused on the application of his risk assessment method to new fields.\n\nSzombatfalvy began his stock trading career with 6,000 Swedish Kronor (Crowns) in the mid-1960s. In 1971 Szombatfalvy resigned from his then employment with the Finance Department at Swedish Shell to begin full-time trading in shares. By the time he had celebrated his 60th birthday in 1987, Szombatfalvy’s wealth was estimated at 250 million Swedish Kronor, at which point he decided to stop active management of his stock. In 2013, through successful placements of shares on the Swedish Stock Exchange, he had reportedly amassed a personal fortune of one billion Kronor. His private fortune was invested mainly in 10 million shares in the listed Swedish real-estate company, Castellum AB.\n\nSzombatfalvy’s model for valuation and calculation of risk analysis of shares - with a record of 30 per cent returns per year for 46 years - was the foundation for his reputation as a successful trader on the Swedish stock market. Magnus Angenfelt, a former stock market analyst and co-founder of the hedge fund Manticore, ranked Szombatfalvy as the best investor in Sweden and the third best in the world in his book \"The World’s 99 Greatest Investors\" (Swedish - \"Världens 99 bästa investerare\").\n\nSzombatfalvy’s philosophy in trading stock is to be a long-term investor, buying companies that are undervalued with low risk. The qualitative model he used to valuate shares in a company didn’t have a formula, but built instead partly on a comprehensive analysis of the company itself, and partly on studying the stock market and interviewing people in the market. His analysis of companies also included an in-depth study of the company, its branches and its management, which resulted in both an optimistic and pessimistic long-term prognosis of the company’s projected dividend growth. The focus of Szombatfalvy’s study was on the dividend growth and the most important key was the company’s profits in its own capital, as this shows the company’s theoretical dividend and growth capacity.\n\nIn November 2009 Szombatfalvy made his debut as an author. In the book \"The Greatest Challenges of Our Time\" he briefly analyzes the severe threats facing humanity issuing from four mega-problems: environmental damage, climate change, weapons of mass destruction and extreme poverty. He emphasizes the necessity for politicians to perform risk calculations in order to make the right decisions. The book was translated and released in English in September 2010. At the same time a second (revised) version was released in Swedish.\n\nThe following year, he released his second book, \"Känslor och förnuft\" (\"Emotions and Mind: A book about moral decisions\"), which discusses the concept of morality and how we should relate to our moral decisions in everyday life, work and in relationships with other people.\n\nIn March 2013, Szombatfalvy started the Global Challenges Foundation whose aim is to increase awareness of global catastrophic risks and improve the world’s capacity to solve future crises. Szombatfalvy is currently the Chairman of the Global Challenges Foundation Board, which also includes the former Fourth National Pension Fund's CEO and sustainable investment advocate, Mats Andersson, and Climate Professor Johan Rockström.\n\nThe foundation’s assets predominantly consist of a donation from Szombatfalvy, which will include roughly half of his fortune - around 500 million Swedish kronor.\n\nIn 2017, the foundation offered $5 million (USD) to winners of the Global Challenges Foundation Prize 2017 − a contest asking for proposals for a new model capable of solving global problems.\n"}

Prinz von Anhalt claims his parents owned a jewelry store, before their business was declared bankrupt and the family lost vast amounts of their wealth.<ref name=\"princegermany.com/aboutme\">princegermany.com/aboutme/</ref> At age 13, Eberhardt held many jobs, and left school at 16 to become an apprentice butcher. He started a cleaning service, which was a subsidiary for the butcher business, and was receiving a combined income of 6000 Deutsche Mark at age 16. He completed another apprenticeship to become a chef, opening several restaurants and starting an interior design business.\n\nEberhardt further diversified his organisation by opening several table-dance bars and gentlemen's clubs in the United States. He later bought several brothels, earning the nickname \"red-light king.\" After this investment, Eberhardt was charged with money laundering, tax fraud and human trafficking.\n\nHe is one of the largest and most visible owners of brothels in Germany, with over twenty brothels and night clubs. He has served four years in prison, for human trafficking and tax evasion. He claims to be a millionaire \"in the three digit range,\" owning about 40 cars, real estate in Los Angeles (a mansion in Bel Air he shares with Zsa Zsa Gabor and Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt), Fort Lauderdale, Pforzheim, St. Gallen, Dubai and Monaco, and to have 12 bodyguards and 25 servants.\n\nIn 2006, he bought his name for several million U.S. dollars by being adopted by Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt, husband of Zsa Zsa Gabor, who had himself obtained his name by adoption. The adoption and name change did not confer any actual title or nobility. \"Prinz von Anhalt\" is a surname (literally Prince of Anhalt), rather than a title, as per German laws abolishing the country's former nobility in 1919. Furthermore, the Anhalt family does not include Marcus Prinz von Anhalt as a member. He likes to refer to himself as \"Prinz Germany.\" His brothers by adoption include Oliver Prinz von Anhalt, Michael Prinz von Anhalt and Markus Maximilian Prinz von Anhalt. His sister by adoption is Francesca Hilton, who is the stepdaughter of his adoptive father and birth daughter of his adoptive mother. In 2008, he organized the \"Royal Race,\" a tour of expensive cars and prominent drivers across Europe. Pamela Anderson was his partner at the race. In February 2009 he was seen having lunch with her in Los Angeles. In 2009, when Zsa Zsa Gabor lost a substantial amount of money to Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme, he helped out with a cheque for $6 million.\n\nIn November 2014 Marcus Prinz von Anhalt was sentenced to prison again. The judgment is not legally binding yet. While appealing the sentence, Prinz von Anhalt spent two years in detention.\n\nThe prison sentence of 4 years was based on charges of tax evasion and fraud. The prosecution had accused Prinz von Anhalt of tax evasion of 1.5 million Euros. The prosecution had put forward an estimation of monetary damages for the tax authorities by Anhalt of Euro 747,000 and another attempt to evade taxes of Euro 820,000. In particular, the prosecution accused von Anhalt that he declared the private usage of his 14 luxury cars (all of a value of at least 1 Million Euros) and vacations in Las Vegas as professional and business expenditures towards the tax authorities. Von Anhalt argued that \"his glamorous lifestyle\" is part of his profession as a \"TV star\" and that therefore, he merely used his luxury cars for \"representational\" reasons, stating: \"Driving in my Porsche, Ferrari and Rolls-Royce and traveling to a show in Las Vegas occurred for professional reasons only.\" In addition, von Anhalt attempted to persuade the judge and the prosecution that if he did commit tax evasion, then it must have been unintentional as he did not fully understand the German tax laws at the time concerned, stating: \"I know that the German tax laws are extremely complicated and maybe even the most complicated in the world. Some people may be able to understand the German tax laws but he is not one of them; but he knows how to successfully manage a brothel\". The judges did not believe von Anhalt's explanations and consequently imposed a prison sentence of 4 years. Von Anhalt had declared previously that \"he does not see a criminal offense in his case\" and that the sums he supposedly evaded from tax authorities are \"petty\" and \"ridiculous\" given that \"his brothels and disco clubs generate revenues in the two digit million range.\"\n\nIn prison it was discovered that von Anhalt had sent a letter to an acquaintance where he would insult the district attorney who had represented the prosecution in von Anhalts trial.

{"id": "40640761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40640761", "title": "Mokken scale", "text": "Mokken scale\n\nThe Mokken Scale is a psychometric method of data reduction. A Mokken scale is a unidimensional scale that consists of hierarchically-ordered items that measure the same underlying, latent concept. This method is named after the political scientist Rob Mokken who suggested it in 1971.\n\nMokken Scales have been used in psychology, education, political science, public opinion, medicine and nursing.\n\nMokken scaling belongs to Item response theory. In essence, a Mokken scale is a non-parametric, probabilistic version of Guttman scale. Both Guttman and Mokken scaling can be used to assess whether a number of items measure the same underlying concept. Both Guttman and Mokken scaling are based on the assumption that the items are hierarchically ordered: this means that they are ordered by degree of \"difficulty\". Difficulty here means the percentage of respondents that answers the question affirmatively. The hierarchical order means that a respondent who answered a difficult question correctly is assumed to answer an easy question correctly.\nThe key difference between a Guttman and Mokken scale is that Mokken scaling is probabilistic in nature. The assumption is not that \"every\" respondent who answered a difficult question affirmatively will \"necessarily\" answer an easy question affirmatively. Violations of this are called Guttman errors. Instead, the assumption is that respondents who answered a difficult question affirmatively are more \"likely\" to answer an easy question affirmatively. The scalability of the scale is measured by Loevinger's coefficient H. H compares the actual Guttman errors to the expected number of errors if the items would be unrelated.\n\nThe chance that a respondent will answer an item correctly is described by an item response function. Mokken scales are similar to Rasch scales, in that they both adapted Guttman scales to a probabilistic model. However, Mokken scaling is described as 'non-parametric' because it makes no assumptions about the precise shape of the item response function, only that it is monotone and non-decreasing. The key difference between Mokken scales and Rasch scales is that the latter assumes that all items have the same item response function. In Mokken scaling the Item Response Functions differ for different items.\n\nMokken scales can come in two forms: first as the Double Monotonicity model, where the items can differ in their difficulty. It is essentially, is an ordinal version of Rasch scale; and second, as the Monotone Homogeneity model, where items differ in their discrimination parameter, which means that there can be a weaker relationship between some items and the latent variable and other items and the latent variable. Double Monotonicity models are used most often.\n\nDouble Monotonicity models are based on three assumptions.\n\nThe issue of sample size for Mokken scaling is largely unresolved. Work using simulated samples and varying the item quality in the scales (Loevinger's coefficient and the correlation between scales) suggests that, where the quality of the items is high that lower samples sizes in the region of 250-500 are required compared with sample sizes of 1250-1750 where the item quality is low. Using real data from the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well Being Scale (WEMWBS) suggests that the required sample size depends on the Mokken scaling parameters of interest as they do not all respond in the same way to varying sample size.\n\nWhile Mokken scaling analysis was originally developed to measure the extent to which individual dichotomous items form a scale, it has since been extended for polytomous items. Moreover, while Mokken scaling analysis is a confirmatory method, meant to test whether a number of items form a coherent scale (like Confirmatory factor analysis), an Automatic Item Selection Procedure has been developed to explore which latent dimensions structure responses on a number of observable items (like Factor analysis).\n\nThere has been some confusion in Mokken scaling between the concepts of Double Monotonicity model and invariant item ordering. The latter implies that all respondents to a series of questions all respond to them in the same order across the whole range of the latent trait. For dichotomously scored items, the Double Monotonicity model can mean invariant item ordering; however, for polytomously scored items this does not necessarily hold. For invariant item ordering to hold not only should the item response functions not intersect, also, the item step response function between one level and the next within each item must not intersect.\n\nMokken scaling software is available within the public domain statistical software R (programming language) and also within the data analysis and statistical software stata. MSP5 for Windows for use on personal computers is no longer compatible with current versions of Microsoft Windows. Also within the R (programming language), unusual response patterns in Mokken Scales can be checked using the package PerFit. Two guides on how to conduct a Mokken scale analysis have been published.\n"}

The \"award\" is in effect an advisory opinion of the arbitrator's view of the respective merits of the parties cases. Non-binding arbitration is used in connection with attempts to reach a negotiated settlement. The role of an arbitrator in non-binding arbitration is, on the surface, similar to that of a mediator in a mediation. However, the principal distinction is that whereas a mediator will try to help the parties find a middle ground to compromise at, the arbitrator remains totally removed from the settlement process and will only give a determination of liability and, if appropriate, an indication of the quantum of damages payable.\n\nSubsequent to a non-binding arbitration, the parties remain free to pursue their claims either through the courts, or by way of a binding arbitration, although in practice a settlement is the most common outcome. The award and reasoning in a non-binding arbitration is almost invariably inadmissible in any subsequent action in the courts or in another arbitration tribunal.\n\nNon-binding arbitration is utilised mostly in the United States and Canada. It is largely unknown in Europe, although in the United Kingdom there is a practice of parties who are seeking a settlement to jointly instruct a Queen's Counsel for an opinion on the merits and likely quantum of a claim, and then to negotiate on the basis of the views expressed in that opinion.\n\n\n"}

He is the founder of Basic Element, one of Russia's largest industrial groups, and Volnoe Delo, Russia's largest charitable foundation. Until 2018, he was the president of En+ Group, a Russian energy-related company, and United Company Rusal, the second largest aluminium company in the world. \n\nAfter graduating from Moscow State University with a degree in physics, Deripaska became a metals broker specialized in trading aluminium before expanding into energy, machinery, financial services and agribusiness. In 2000, Deripaska founded Rusal, the result of a partnership between Sibirsky Aluminium and Roman Abramovich's Millhouse Capital. In 2007, Rusal merged with SUAL Group and Glencore International AG to form UC Rusal, with Deripaska as chairman.\n\nHe was once Russia's richest man, worth $28 billion, but lost a substantial part of his fortune amid the 2007–08 financial crisis. As of August 2018, his wealth was estimated by \"Forbes\" at $3.3 billion. \n\nDeripaska is also known for his connection to American political consultant Paul Manafort, who has been convicted on charges of tax fraud, bank fraud and failure to report foreign bank accounts, which stemmed from Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Deripaska employed Manafort from at least 2005 to 2009.\n\nAs the founder of Volnoe Delo foundation, he is reported to have donated more than $250 million to mostly educational causes. He was married to Polina Yumasheva, step-granddaughter of former Russian President Boris Yeltsin and daughter of Valentin Yumashev, Yeltsin's son-in-law and close advisor. According to some media reports, they were divorced in 2018.\n\nDeripaska was also granted Cypriot citizenship in 2017.\n\nDeripaska was born in Dzerzhinsk, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Soviet Russia and grew up in Ust-Labinsk, Krasnodar Krai. His parents were from Kuban. Deripaska grew up on the family's small farm, where from the age of 5 or 6, he learned how to live off the land from his grandparents, who primarily raised him after his widowed mother, an engineer, had to leave to find work. Deripaska credits his grandparents for teaching him the discipline of hard work along with farming. Both his grandfathers fought in the Second World War; one was killed in battle and buried in a mass grave in Austria, the other returned to Russia after the war ended. \n\nDeripaska's first job was at the Ust-Labinsk plant where his mother worked. At age 11, he became an electrician's apprentice doing maintenance on electrical motors. Deripaska acquired a passion for reading; his favorite authors were Mayne Reid and Jack London. Today, Basic Element's headquarters contain walls of books, reflecting Deripaska's lifelong love of reading. His talent for math allowed him to enroll at the physics faculty of Moscow State University in 1985. One year into his studies, he was conscripted into the armed forces and served in the Soviet army's Strategic Missile Forces in the Trans-Baikal area, Siberia, from 1986–1989.\n\nIn 1993, Deripaska graduated with honors in physics from Moscow State University; however, the collapse of the Soviet Union greatly eliminated academic funding and made it impossible for him to continue his studies as a theoretical physicist. There were no stipends or grants for students either. \"We had no money. It was an urgent and practical question every day. How do I earn money to buy food and keep studying?\" he recalls. In 1996, he earned a master's degree from the Plekhanov University of Economics.\n\nAt the age of 25, teaming up with fellow physicists, engineers and rocket scientists, Deripaska set up his first metal trading company, VTK. He adopted a systematic, scientific approach to commodity trading. \"I represented companies that were buying and selling raw materials\", Deripaska said. Deripaska undertook export arbitrage, buying metal at low Russian prices and selling it abroad at significantly higher international market prices. Deripaska traded primarily through the Baltic state of Estonia as the Russian system of export licenses was in disarray. \"I started my business at an unusual moment in history. The country in which I was born raised had disappeared, although the new country was not fully formed. The first one gave me an excellent education; the second one gave me the chance of success\", Deripaska recalled in an interview with \"Metal Bulletin\".\n\nHe used nearly all his arbitrage and trading profits to acquire his initial package of shares in the Sayanogorsk Aluminium Smelter in Southern Siberia. Between 1993 and 1994, Deripaska bought vouchers and shares in Sayanogorsk, and accumulated a 20% stake in the factory, becoming the biggest individual shareholder after the Russian State—to the annoyance of the plant's Communist-era bosses.\n\nIn 1994, Deripaska became director general of the plant at the age of 26. In 1997, he founded Sibirsky (Siberian) Aluminium Group, which in 2000 merged with Roman Abramovich's Millhouse Capital to create RUSAL. In 2003, businesses led by Deripaska increased their stake in those companies under common management to 75% by acquiring half of the interest managed by Millhouse Capital. In 2004, the consolidation of RUSAL's ownership by companies related to Deripaska was completed with the acquisition of the remaining 25% equity interest in RUSAL managed by Millhouse Capital.\n\nRUSAL went on to become the largest aluminium producer in the world, until the China Hongqiao Group surpassed it in 2015. In 2010, under Deripaska's leadership, Rusal became the first Russian company to be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.\n\nBeyond metals, which remain at the core of his diversified industrial holding, Deripaska has acquired stakes in a wide range of companies in various sectors, including energy, manufacturing, commercial vehicles, auto components, financial and insurance services, leasing businesses, construction, aviation, and agriculture. Among his assets are a Siberian power company EuroSibEnergo, that is Russia's biggest private energy company; Ingosstrakh, one of Russia's largest insurance companies; GAZ Group, a producer of cars, trucks and buses, agricultural business (Kuban Agro Holding); and transport companies, such as a cluster of airports in the Krasnodar region, including Sochi and Krasnodar.\n"}

The program aimed to support locally made and marketed products of each of Thailand's 7,255 tambons (sub-district). Drawing its inspiration from Japan's successful One Village One Product (OVOP) program, the OTOP program encourages village communities to improve the quality and marketing of local products, selecting one superior product from each tambon to receive formal branding as its \"starred OTOP product\". It provides both a local and national stage to the promote these products. OTOP includes a large array of local products, including traditional handicrafts, cotton and silk garments, pottery, fashion accessories, household items, and foods. After a military junta overthrew Thaksin's government in 2006 following an election cancelled for irregularities, the OTOP program was cancelled. However, it was soon revived and rebranded.\n\nThe One Tambon One Product movement is a self-help effort wherein rural communities participate in the creation of a product that can be sold locally and internationally.\n\nOTOP is managed by the Community Development Department (CDD) of Thailand's Interior Ministry. \n\nThere are 36,000 OTOP groups in Thailand, each having between 30 to 3,000 members. Sakda Siridechakul, president of Chiang Mai's OTOP association noted, \"OTOP has helped spread income to many people in the villages. It has allowed people producing handicrafts to feel they are part of the global economy.\"\n\nIn 2017 OTOP product sales were 153 billion baht. The government aims for sales of 200-300 billion baht every year.\n\nThe government allocated 8.3 billion baht budget to the CDD to stimulate community tourism in 3,273 villages across the country between April–September 2018. Among the program's aims are to develop at least 64,570 new OTOP items with an average annual sales growth of at least 10 percent.\n\nThe military junta that overthrew the Thai Rak Thai government on 19 September 2006 changed the program's name to \"Local and Community Products\", but OTOP branding was kept.\n\nOne of the mechanisms to promote and support the development of Thai OTOP products is the \"Product Champion\" (OPC). Besides setting up OTOP communities and small to medium enterprises (SME), a seminar called \"Smart OTOP\" has now provided more than 26,600 participants advice in improving their skills and knowledge in order to develop better products. The number of participants increases each year.\n\nA rating system for OTOP products is followed, the highest being five stars. At last count, there were 569 five-star products.\n\nThere is an annual exhibition of products called \"OTOP Mid-year\". OTOP Mid-year-2010 ended with consolidated turnover of 810 million baht.\n\n\n"}

As the quality control manager of the Pershing missile program, Crosby was credited with a 25 percent reduction in the overall rejection rate and a 30 percent reduction in scrap costs.\n\nCrosby was born in Wheeling, West Virginia, in 1926. He served in the Navy during World War II and again during the Korean War. In between, he earned a degree from the Ohio College of Podiatric Medicine.\n\nHis first job in the field of quality was that of test technician in the quality department at Crosley Corporation in Richmond, Indiana beginning in 1952. He left for a better-paying position as reliability engineer at Bendix Corporation in Mishawaka, Indiana in 1955, working on the RIM-8 Talos missile. He left after less than two years to become senior quality engineer at The Martin Company's new Orlando, Florida organization to develop the Pershing missile. There he developed the Zero Defects concept. He eventually rose to become department head before leaving for ITT Corporation in 1965 to become director of quality.\n\nIn 1979, Crosby started the management consulting company Philip Crosby Associates, Inc. This consulting group provided educational courses in quality management both at their headquarters in Winter Park, Florida, and at eight foreign locations. Also in 1979, Crosby published his first business book, \"Quality Is Free\". This book would become popular at the time because of the crisis in North American quality. During the late 1970s and into the 1980s, North American manufacturers were losing market share to Japanese products largely due to the superior quality of the Japanese goods.\n\nCrosby's response to the quality crisis was the principle of \"doing it right the first time\" (DIRFT). He also included four major principles:\n\nHis belief was that an organization that establishes good quality management principles will see savings returns that more than pay for the cost of the quality system: \"quality is free\". It is less expensive to do it right the first time than to pay for rework and repairs.\n"}

Activities including raising and approving purchase orders, selecting and ordering the product or service, receiving and matching the invoice and order, and paying the bill is handled electronically, enabling the procurement department to see everything that is ordered, ensure that nothing can be ordered without correct approvals, and lets them get the best value by combining several orders for the same type of good or even getting suppliers to bid for the business. Buying organisation's choice can be driven by the particular strengths offered by each individual system and the number of vendors available through them. A multinational or otherwise large organization will use a shared procurement system to take advantage of economies of scale to drive down the cost of purchases. While traditionally most e-procurement software systems have been designed for larger organizations, there are now also systems available for the SMB market, such as the Free-Procurement Project and an open source alternative by ProcuMan. Whilst some services are available to purchase through automated systems, the key strength of these systems lies in the procurement of commodities that are much easier to standardise.\n\nThe key benefit for organisations using procurement software include ease of administration and potential long-term cost savings. Having a single interface for procurement related management information cuts down the time and effort required to monitor organisational spending. The use of such software also allows procurement managers to control the vendors used by the wider organisation so all employees take advantage of negotiated rates and other terms of service.\n\nCommon Features of Procurement Software Systems\n\nRequisitions - Creation of a purchase order with line items to be fulfilled by a vendor.

{"id": "12119521", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12119521", "title": "Proxy voting", "text": "Proxy voting\n\nProxy voting is a form of voting whereby a member of a decision-making body may delegate his or her voting power to a representative, to enable a vote in absence. The representative may be another member of the same body, or external. A person so designated is called a \"proxy\" and the person designating him or her is called a \"principal\". Proxy appointments can be used to form a voting bloc that can exercise greater influence in deliberations or negotiations. Proxy voting is a particularly important practice with respect to corporations; in the United States, investment advisers often vote proxies on behalf of their client accounts.\n\nThe United States parliamentary manual \"Riddick's Rules of Procedure\" notes that, under proxy voting, voting for officers should be done by ballot, due to the difficulties involved in authentication if a member simply calls out, \"I cast 17 votes for Mr. X.\"\n\nProxy voting is also an important feature in corporate governance through the proxy statement. Companies use proxy solicitation agencies like Boudicca Proxy Consultants to secure proxy votes.\n\nThe rules of some assemblies presently forbid proxy voting. For example, in both houses of the U.S. Congress, as well as in most if not all state legislatures, each member must be present and cast his own vote for that vote to be counted. This can result, however, in the absence of a quorum and the need to compel attendance by a sufficient number of missing members to get a quorum. See \"call of the house\".\n\nIt is possible for automatic proxy voting to be used in legislatures, by way of direct representation (this idea is essentially a form of Weighted voting). For example, it has been proposed that instead of electing members from single-member districts (that may have been gerrymandered), members be elected at large, but when seated each member cast the number of votes he or she received in the last election. Thus, if, for example, a state were allocated 32 members in the U.S. House of Representatives, the 32 candidates who received the most votes in the at-large election would be seated, but each would cast a different number of votes on the floor and in committee. This proposal would allow for representation of minority views in legislative deliberations, as it does in deliberations at shareholder meetings of corporations. Such a concept was proposed in a submission to the 2007 Ontario Citizens' Assembly process. Two real-life examples of weighted voting include the Council of Ministers of the European Union and the US Electoral College.\n\nThe Parliament of New Zealand allows proxy voting. Sections 155-156 of the Standing Orders of the New Zealand House of Representatives specify the procedures for doing so. A member can designate another member or a party to cast his vote. However, a party may not exercise proxies for more than 25% of its members (rounded upwards). The \"New Zealand Listener\" notes a controversial occurrence of proxy voting. The Labour Party was allowed to cast votes on behalf of Taito Phillip Field, who was frequently absent. Theoretically, this was to be allowed only if a legislator was absent on parliamentary business, public business or pressing private business, such as illness or bereavement.\n\nUntil the Republican reforms of 1995 banished the practice, proxy voting was also used in U.S. House of Representatives committees. Often members would delegate their vote to the ranking member of their party in the committee. Republicans opposed proxy voting on the grounds that it allowed an indolent Democratic majority to move legislation through committee with antimajoritarian procedures. That is, the Democratic leader in the committee would successfully oppose the sitting Republican majority by wielding the proxies of absent Democrats.\n\nThomas E. Mann and Norman J. Ornstein write, \"In a large and fragmented institution in which every member has five or six places to be at any given moment, proxy voting is a necessary evil\".\n\nProxy voting is sometimes described as \"the frequency with which spouses, union workers, and friends of friends are in effect sent off to the polls with an assignment to complete.\" The potential for proxy voting exists in roughly one voter out of five, and it is about twice as high at the middle levels of the sophistication continuum. According to W. Russell Neuman, the net effect of the cues provided by friends and associates is not likely to be as significant as those of the political parties.\n\nThe possibility of expanded use of proxy voting has been the subject of much speculation. Terry F. Buss et al. write that internet voting would result in de facto approval of proxy voting, since passwords could be shared with others: \"Obviously, cost-benefit calculations around the act of voting could also change substantially as organizations attempt to identify and provide inducements to control proxy votes without violating vote-buying prohibitions in the law.\"\n\nOne of the criticisms of proxy voting is that it carries a risk of fraud or intimidation. Another criticism is that it violates the concept of a secret ballot, in that paperwork may be filed, for instance, designating a party worker as one's proxy.\n\nIt has been proposed that proxy voting be combined with initiative and referendum to form a hybrid of direct democracy and representative democracy.\nJames C. Miller III, Ronald Reagan's budget director, suggested scrapping representative democracy and instead implementing a \"program for direct and proxy voting in the legislative process.\" It has been suggested by Joseph Francis Zimmerman that proxy voting be allowed in New England town meetings.\n\nProxy voting can eliminate some of the problems associated with the public choice dilemma of bundling.\n\nAccording to Arch Puddington et al., in Albanian Muslim areas, many women have been effectively disenfranchised through proxy voting by male relatives.\n\nIn Algeria, restrictions on proxy voting were instituted circa 1991 in order to undermine the Islamic Salvation Front.\n\nIn Canada, the province of Nova Scotia allows citizens to vote by proxy if they expect to be absent. The Territories of Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut also allow for proxy voting. Canadian prisoners of war in enemy camps were allowed to vote through proxy voting. David Stewart and Keith Archer opine that proxy voting can result in leadership selection processes to become leader-dominated. Proxy voting had only been available to military personnel since World War II, but was extended in 1970 and 1977 to include voters in special circumstances such as northern camp operators, fishermen, and prospectors. The Alberta Liberal Party ran into some difficulties, in that an unknown number of proxy ballots that were counted may have been invalid. Those who, through proxy voting or assistance of invalids, become knowledgeable of the principal's choice are bound to secrecy.\n\nSome Chinese provinces allow village residents to designate someone to vote on their behalf. Lily L. Tsai notes that \"In practice, one family member often casts votes for everyone in the family even if they are present for the election. In 1997, a Carter Center delegation recommended abolishing the proxy voting that allowed one person to vote for three; the International Republican Institute had made a similar recommendation. Proxy voting also became an issue in relation to many of the Wenzhou people doing business outside. Most election disputes revolved around proxy votes, including the issues of who could represent them to vote and what kinds of evidence were acceptable for proxy voting. Intense competition made the proxy voting process more and more formal and transparent. Some villages required a notary to validate faxed proxy votes; some villages asked for faxed signatures; more often villages publicized those proxy votes so that villagers could directly monitor them. Taicang government reported a 99.4% voter turnout in its 1997 election, but a study showed that after removing proxy votes, only 48% of the eligible voters in the sample reported that they actually went to the central polling station to vote.\n\nAccording to Mim Kelber, \"in Central Africa, all it takes for a man to cast a proxy vote for his wife is to produce an unwitnessed letter mentioning the name of the person to whom the voting power is delegated.\" The Gabon respondent to an Inter-Parliamentary Union letter commented, \"It has been observed that this possibility was exploited to a far greater extent by men than by women, for reasons not always noble.\"\n\nProxy voting played an important role in Guyana politics in the 1960s. Prior to and during the 1961 elections, proxies had been severely restricted. Some restrictions were lifted, and there was a rise in proxy votes cast from 300 in 1961 to 6,635 in 1964. After that election, the Commonwealth Team of Observers voiced concern about proxy votes being liable to fraud. The proxy voting rules were relaxed further, and in 1969, official figures recorded 19,287 votes cast by proxy, about 7% of the total votes cast (an increase from 2.5% in 1964 to 1968). Amidst allegations of fraud, more restrictions were placed on proxy voting in 1973; in that year, about 10,000 votes were cast by proxy.\n\nIn 2003, India's People's Representative Act was amended to allow armed forces personnel to appoint a proxy to vote on their behalf.\n\nIn Iraq, the Electoral Laws of 1924 and 1946 ruled out the possibility of proxy voting, except for illiterates, who could appoint someone to write for them.\n\nSome instances of proxy voting (usually by family members) in the Russian parliamentary elections of 1995 were noted by observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\n\nThe provision for proxy voting in the UK dates back to James I. Long before women's suffrage, women sometimes voted as proxies for absent male family heads.\n\nUnder British electoral law, ballot papers could not be sent overseas. British expatriates had no right to vote until the mid-1980s. They can now vote by proxy in general elections if they have been on a British electoral register at some point in the past 15 years. They can also vote by post.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, electors may appoint a proxy. An elector can only act as a proxy for two people to whom they are not directly related. However, they can be a proxy for any number of electors if they are directly related to those electors. The voter can change his mind and vote in the election personally as long as his proxy has not already voted on his behalf or applied to vote by mail.\n\nVoters must provide a reason for using a proxy, such as being away on vacation. A narrower subset of reasons is permissible if the proxy is to be for more than one election. Except in cases of blindness, the validity of all proxies must be certified by someone such as an employer or doctor.\n\nIn 2004, two Liberal Democrat councillors were found guilty of submitting 55 fraudulent proxy votes and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment.\n\nThe Electoral Reform Society has proposed the abolition of proxy voting in the UK except in special circumstances such as when the voter is abroad.\n\nIn 1635–36, Massachusetts granted to the frontier towns \"liberty to stay soe many of their freemen at home for the safety of their towne as they judge needful, and that the said freemen that are appoyncted by the towne to stay at home shall have liberty for this court to send their voices by proxy.\" According to Charles Seymour and Donald Paige Frary, had not proxy voting been implemented, the inhabitants of the frontier towns would have lost their franchises, and the government would have represented only the freemen in the vicinity of Boston. The roads were poor; the drawing of all a village's men at once would have exposed it to Indian attacks; and at election time, the emigrants' labor was needed to get the spring planting into the ground. As late as 1680, and probably even after the charter was revoked in 1684, the Freeman might give his vote for Magistrates in person or proxy at the Court of Elections.\n\nProxy voting was also adopted in colonies adjacent to Massachusetts. Indeed, traces of the practice of proxy voting remained in Connecticut's election laws until the final supersedure of her charter in 1819.\n\nIn Maryland, the primary assemblies allowed proxy voting. After the assembly of 1638, protests were sent to the proprietor in England. It was said that the Governor and his friends were able to exercise too much influence through the proxies they had obtained.\n\nProxy voting was also used in South Carolina; the proprietors in September 1683 complained to the governor about this system. Proxy voting was used in Long Island, New York as well, at that time. Phraseology was sometimes designed to hide the fact that a proxy system was in use and that the majority of voters did not actually attend the elections. In Rhode Island, the system described as a \"proxy\" system, from 1664 onward, was actually simply the sending of written ballots from voters who did not attend the election, rather than a true proxy system, as in the assembly of 1647.\n\nIn Alabama, the Perry County Civic League's members' assisting illiterate voters by marking a ballot on their behalf was deemed \"proxy voting\" and \"voting more than once\" and thus held to be illegal.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, some northern soldiers used proxy voting. After Ira Eastman's near-victory in New Hampshire, Republicans supported a bill to allow soldiers to vote by proxy, but it was ruled unconstitutional by the state supreme court.\n\nIn the Progressive Era, proxy voting was used in Republican Party state conventions in New Hampshire. The Boston and Maine Railroad, the Republican Party's ally, maintained control over the Party by means of these conventions. \"At the 1906 state convention, for instance, party delegates were quite willing to trade, sell, or exchange their voting power in return for various forms of remuneration from the party machine. Public outcry led to the end of such 'proxy' voting\".\n\nProxy voting was used in some American U.S. Presidential nominating caucuses. In one case, Eugene McCarthy supporters were in the majority of those present but were outvoted when the presiding party official cast 492 proxy votes – three times the number present – for his own slate of delegates. After the nomination of Hubert Humphrey, the New Politics movement charged that Humphrey and party bosses had circumvented the will of Democratic Party members by manipulating the rules to Humphrey's advantage. In response, the Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection, also known as the McGovern-Fraser Commission, was created to rework the rules in time for the 1972 Democratic National Convention. State parties were required to ban proxy voting in order to have their delegates seated at the national convention. It was said that these rules had been used in \"highly selective\" ways.\n\nSeveral attempts have been made to place proxy voting-related initiatives on the California ballot, but all have failed.\n\nProxy is defined by supreme courts as \"an \"authority\" or power to \"do\" a certain thing.\" A person can confer on his proxy any power which he himself possesses. He may also give him secret instructions as to voting upon particular questions. But a proxy is ineffectual when it is contrary to law or public policy. Where the proxy is duly appointed and he acts within the scope of the proxy, the person authorizing the proxy is bound by his appointee's acts, including his errors or mistakes. When the appointer sends his appointee to a meeting, the proxy may do anything at that meeting necessary to a full and complete exercise of the appointer's right to vote at such meeting. This includes the right to vote to take the vote by ballot, or to adjourn (and, hence, he may also vote on other ordinary parliamentary motions, such as to refer, postpone, reconsider, etc., when necessary or when deemed appropriate and advantageous to the overall object or purpose of the proxy).\n\nA proxy cannot vote when the principal himself is present and votes. He can vote only in the principal's absence. Where the authority conferred upon a proxy is limited to a designated or special purpose, a vote for another and different purpose is ineffective. A proxy in the usual, ordinary form confers authority to act only at the meeting then in contemplation, and in any adjourned-meetings of the same; hence, it may not be voted at another or different meeting held under a \"new call\". A proxy's unauthorized acts may be ratified by his appointer, and such ratification is equivalent to previous authority. According to the weight of authority, a proxy only to vote stock may be revoked at any time, notwithstanding any agreement that it shall be irrevocable. The sale in the meantime by a stockholder of his shares in a corporation or company automatically revokes any proxies made or given to vote in respect of such shares. And a proxy is also revoked where the party giving it attends the election in person, or gives subsequent proxy. Hence, a proxy cannot vote when the owner of the stock arrives late or is present and votes.\n\nIn Vietnam, proxy voting was used to increase turnout. Presently, proxy voting is illegal, but it has nonetheless been occurring since before 1989. It is estimated to contribute about 20% to voter turnout, and has been described as \"a convenient way to fulfil one's duty, avoid possible risks, and avoid having to participate directly in the act of voting\". It is essentially a compromise between the party-state, which wants to have high turnouts as proof of public support, and voters who do not want to go to the polling stations. In the Soviet Union, proxy voting was also illegal but done in order to increase turnout figures.\n\nProxy voting is automatically prohibited in organizations that have adopted Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised (RONR) or The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure (TSC) as their parliamentary authority, unless it is provided for in its bylaws or charter or required by the laws of its state of incorporation. Robert's Rules says, \"If the law under which an organization is incorporated allows proxy voting to be prohibited by a provision of the bylaws, the adoption of this book as parliamentary authority by prescription in the bylaws should be treated as sufficient provision to accomplish that result\". Demeter says the same thing, but also states that \"if these laws do \"not\" prohibit voting by proxy, the body can pass a law permitting proxy voting for any purpose desired.\" RONR opines, \"Ordinarily it should neither be allowed nor required, because proxy voting is incompatible with the essential characteristics of a deliberative assembly in which membership is individual, personal, and nontransferable. In a stock corporation, on the other hand, where the ownership is transferable, the voice and vote of the member also is transferable, by use of a proxy.\" While Riddick opines that \"proxy voting properly belongs in incorporate organizations that deal with stocks or real estate, and in certain political organizations,\" it also states, \"If a state empowers an incorporated organization to use proxy voting, that right cannot be denied in the bylaws.\" Riddick further opines, \"Proxy voting is not recommended for ordinary use. It can discourage attendance, and transfers an inalienable right to another without positive assurance that the vote has not been manipulated.\"\n\n\"Parliamentary Law\" expounds on this point:\n\nNonetheless, it is common practice in conventions for a delegate to have an alternate, who is basically the same as a proxy. Demeter's Manual notes that the alternate has all the privileges of voting, debate and participation in the proceedings to which the delegate is entitled. Moreover, \"if voting has for years...been conducted...by proxy...such voting by long and continuous custom has the force of law, and the proceedings are valid.\"\n\nThomas E. Arend notes that U.S. laws allow proxy votes to be conducted electronically in certain situations: \"The use of electronic media may be permissible for proxy voting, but such voting is generally limited to members. Given the fiduciary duties that are personal to each director, and the need for directors to deliberate to ensure properly considered decisions, proxy voting by directors is usually prohibited by statute. In contrast, a number of state nonprofit corporate statutes allow for member proxy voting and may further allow members to use electronic media to grant a proxy right to another party for member voting purposes.\" Sturgis agrees, \"Directors or board members cannot vote by proxy in their meetings, since this would mean the delegation of a discretionary legislative duty which they cannot delegate.\"\n\nProxy voting, even if allowed, may be limited to infrequent use if the rules governing a body specify minimum attendance requirements. For instance, bylaws may prescribe that a member can be dropped for missing three consecutive meetings.\n\nThe Journal of Mental Science noted the arguments raised against adopting proxy voting for the Association. These included that possibility that it would diminish attendance at meetings. The rejoinder was that people did not go there to vote; they attending the meetings for the sake of the meeting, the discussion, and the good fellowship.\n\nIn 2005, the Libertarian Party of Colorado, following intense debate, enacted rules allowing proxy voting. A motion to limit proxies to 5 per person was defeated. Some people favored requiring members attending the convention to bring a certain number of proxies, in order to encourage them to politick. In 2006, the party repealed those bylaw provisions due to concerns that a small group of individuals could use it to take control of the organization.\n\nUnder the common law, shareholders had no right to cast votes by proxy in corporate meetings without special authorization. In \"Walker v. Johnson\", the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia explained that the reason was that early corporations were of a municipal, religious or charitable nature, in which the shareholder had no pecuniary interest. The normal mode of conferring corporate rights was by an issue of a charter from the crown, essentially establishing the corporation as a part of the government. Given the personal trust placed in these voters by the king, it was inappropriate for them to delegate to others. In the Pennsylvania case of \"Commonwealth ex rel. Verree v. Bringhurst\", the court held that members of a corporation had no right to vote by proxy at a corporate election unless such right was expressly conferred by the charter or by a bylaw. The attorneys for the plaintiff argued that the common law rules had no application to trading or moneyed corporations where the relation was not personal. The court found, \"The fact that it is a business corporation in no wise dispenses with the obligation of all members to assemble together, unless otherwise provided, for the exercise of a right to participate in the election of their officers.\" At least as early as the 18th century, however, clauses permitting voting by proxy were being inserted in corporate charters in England.\n\nProxy voting is commonly used in corporations for voting by members or shareholders, because it allows members who have confidence in the judgment of other members to vote for them and allows the assembly to have a quorum of votes when it is difficult for all members to attend, or there are too many members for all of them to conveniently meet and deliberate. Proxy firms commonly advise institutional shareholders on how they should vote. Proxy solicitation firms assist in helping corral votes for a certain resolution.\n\nDomini notes that in the corporate world, \"Proxy ballots typically contain proposals from company management on issues of corporate governance, including capital structure, auditing, board composition, and executive compensation.\"\n\nProxies are essentially the corporate law equivalent of absentee balloting. Shareholders send in a card (called a proxy card) on which they mark their vote. The card authorizes a proxy agent to vote the shareholder's stock as directed on the card. The proxy card may specify how shares are to be voted or may simply give the proxy agent discretion to decide how the shares are to be voted. Under Securities Exchange Commission Rule 14a-3, the incumbent board of directors' first step in soliciting proxies must be the distribution to shareholders of the firm's annual report. An insurgent may independently prepare proxy cards and proxy statements, which are sent to the shareholders.\n\nAssociations of institutional investors sometimes attempt to effect social change. For instance, several hundred faith-based institutional investors, such as denominations, pensions, etc. belong to the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. These organizations commonly exercise influence through shareholder resolutions, which may spur management to action and lead to the resolutions' withdrawal before an actual vote on the resolution is taken.\n\nFiduciaries for ERISA and other pension plans are generally expected to vote proxies on behalf of these plans in a manner than maximizes the economic value for plan participants. In these regard, for ERISA plans, fiduciaries and advisers are very limited in the extent to which they can take social or other goals into account.\n\nIn the absence of his principal from the annual meeting of a business corporation, the proxy has the right to vote in all instances, but he has not the right to debate or otherwise participate in the proceedings unless he is a stockholder in that same corporation.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has ruled that an investment adviser who exercises voting authority over his clients' proxies has a fiduciary responsibility to adopt policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the adviser votes proxies in the best interests of clients, to disclose to clients information about those policies and procedures, to disclose to clients how they may obtain information on how the adviser has voted their proxies, and to keep certain records related to proxy voting. This ruling has been criticized on many grounds, including the contention that it places unnecessary burdens on investment advisers and would not have prevented the major accounting scandals of the early 2000s. Mutual funds must report their proxy votes periodically on Form N-PX.\n\nIt is possible for overvotes and undervotes to occur in corporate proxy situations.\n\nEven in corporate settings, proxy voting's use is generally limited to voting at the annual meeting for directors, for the ratification of acts of the directors, for enlargement or diminution of capital, and for other vital changes in the policy of the organization. These proposed changes are summarized in the circular sent to shareholders prior to the annual meeting. The stock-transfer book is closed at least ten days before the annual meeting, to enable the secretary to prepare a list of stockholders and the number of shares held by each. Stock is voted as shown by the stock book when posted. All proxies are checked against this list.\n\nIt is possible to designate two or more persons to act as proxy by using language appointing, for instance, \"A, B, C, D, and E, F, or any of them, attorneys and agents for me, irrevocable, with full power by the affirmative vote of a majority of said attorneys and agents to appoint a substitute or substitutes for and in the name and stead of me.\"\n\nProxy voting is said to have some anti-deliberative consequences, in that proxy holders often lack discretion about how to cast votes due to the instructions given by their principal. Thus, they cannot alter their decision based on the deliberative process of testing the strength of arguments and counter-arguments.\n\nIn Germany, corporate proxy voting is done through banks. Proxy voting by banks has been a key feature of the connection of banks to corporate ownership in Germany since the industrialization period.\n\nIn delegated voting, the proxy is transitive and the transfer recursive. Put simply, the vote may be further delegated to the proxy's proxy, and so on. This is also called transitive proxy or delegate cascade. An early proposal of delegate voting was that of Lewis Carroll in 1884.\n\nDelegate voting is used by the Swedish local political party Demoex. Demoex won their first seat in the city council of Vallentuna, Sweden, in 2002. The first years of activity in the party have been evaluated by Mitthögskolan University in a paper by Karin Ottesen in 2003. In Demoex, a voter can also vote directly, even if she has delegated her vote to a proxy; the direct vote overrules the proxy vote. It is also possible to change the proxy at any time.\n\nIn 2005, in a pilot study in Pakistan, \"Structural Deep Democracy, SD2\" was used for leadership selection in a sustainable agriculture group called Contact Youth. SD2 uses PageRank for the processing of the transitive proxy votes, with the additional constraints of mandating at least two initial proxies per voter, and all voters are proxy candidates. More complex variants can be built on top of SD2, such as adding specialist proxies and direct votes for specific issues, but SD2 as the underlying umbrella system, mandates that generalist proxies should always be used.\n\nDelegated voting is also used in the World Parliament Experiment, and in implementations of delegative democracy, which is also known as liquid democracy.\n\n\n"}

The EGAD initially began work on the standard between 2012 and 2016, with a conceptual model (RiC-CM) and an ontology (RiC-O) released for comment during 2016.\n\nThe Conceptual Model aims to bring together the Council's current descriptive standards, namely the General International Standard Archival Description (ISAD(G)), International Standard Archival Authority Records — Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families (ISAAR(CPF)), International Standard Description of Functions (ISDF), and International Standard Description of Institutions with Archival Holdings (ISDIAH). RiC also aims to be better suited to the management of electronic records than previous standards, whilst still supporting traditional analogue materials. It defines the primary descriptive entities of the model, and how these interrelate within archival description. RiC also aims to modernise the aging current standards, by enabling archival description to better capture the complex relationships records have with each other, and with their creators, holders, and subjects. These groups, individuals, and organisations are referred to as \"agents\" in RiC. Through these relationships, RiC aims to provide a richer descriptive context than the hierarchical structure of ISAD(G).\n\nThe conceptual model was published for comment in 2016. Among the responses, some have shown confusion as to how it should be applied in practice. A consultation meeting of the Archives and Records Association's Archives and Technology group expressed uncertainty over how the conceptual model should be interpreted by the profession, and how they would engage with and benefit from it in the future.\n\nIn their response, the InterPARES Trust state that a more inclusive development process should have been used given the potentially international application of the model, referring especially to the under-representation of Africa and Asia (acknowledged by EGAD in their introduction to the RiC-CM). Their response also questions the integration of the entire suite of current ICA descriptive standards without first gauging the extent to which these are currently implemented globally.\n\nAlthough in the future EGAD will develop an OWL ontology called RiC-O to represent RiC-CM, there is already an ontology proposal based on the draft of the conceptual model.\n"}
{"id": "57358428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57358428", "title": "Rodolfo Cuenca", "text": "Rodolfo Cuenca\n\nRodolfo Cuenca, sometimes known by his nickname, Rudy Cuenca, is a Filipino businessman best known as the former chairman of the Construction and Development Corporation of the Philippines (CDCP), which is known today as the Philippine National Construction Corporation. He was a close associate of Ferdinand Marcos, and is noted not to be embarrassed by \"his much-criticized close association with Marcos and his being tagged as a crony.\"\n\nRodolfo Cuenca was born on May 1, 1928, at the Philippine General Hospital, to Nicolas and Cristina Cuenca. He is the eldest among four children. Cuenca spent his early years in Vigan, as his father was assigned district engineer in Ilocos Sur. In 1937, the family transferred to Bulacan, where Cuenca finished his fourth and fifth grade. He continued sixth grade in Ateneo de Manila on Padre Faura, then transferred to the Intramuros campus for his seventh grade.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Cuenca withdrew from high school and worked some jobs, one of which was at the General Engineering Depot for the US Army in Malolos. In 1946, he returned to Ateneo to finish high school. He then enrolled in Far Eastern University to study commerce, but soon dropped out to work as a road contractor. On 2 January 1948, he married Yasmin Santos, whom Cuenca met in Angat, Bulacan.\n\nCuenca financially donated to Ferdinand Marcos' first presidential campaign in 1965. In his second year of presidency, Marcos awarded large-scale projects to Cuenca's company, Cuenca Construction Company, which later became part of the Construction and Development Corporation of the Philippines (CDCP). Under the Republic Act (RA) 3741, private contractors were allowed to bid for government infrastructure projects. In 1967, CDCP won government contracts to build the Manila North and South Expressways, valued in just over $16 million. The company maintained its favored treatment until the early 80s, for the benefit Cuenca and Marcos, both of whom divided and funneled commissions and kickbacks into their own pockets.\n\nAccording to Cuenca, it was in also in 1967 when he started joining Marcos to play golf, along with Robert \"Bobby\" Benedicto, the latter's classmate in UP Law School, and the former's close friend since the 1950s. These frequent golf sessions would continue well into the Martial Law era. For Marcos' re-election campaign in 1969, Cuenca again played the role of fundraiser.\n\nCuenca's chairmanship of Construction & Development Corporation of the Philippines (CDCP) began in 1967, and lasted until 1983. It was during this period that Cuenca acquired much of his wealth, properties, and companies. Between these years, CDCP experienced a rapid rise of profits, mainly through what critics called \"bloated\" government contracts. These profits then suddenly plummeted, due to accumulation of government debts and unnecessary expenses.\n\nCuenca's company was involved with many projects, which were constructed at the behest of Ferdinand Marcos and his wife, Imelda Marcos. These included the Manila North and South Luzon Expressways, the San Juanico Bridge, Imelda Marcos' Manila Bay Reclamation Project, and the Light Rail Transit (LRT).\n\nThe first major government contract CDCP was awarded were for the construction of Manila North and South Luzon Expressways. By the end of 1968, the first phase of the Manila North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) was open to the public, the road measuring 28 kilometers towards Guiginto Bulacan from Balintawak. In the same year of 1968, construction for the Manila South Luzon Expressway (SLEX) began. The initial 16-kilometer stretch from Nichols to Alabang was finished by 1970.\n\nThese contracts also allowed CDCP to gain back their expenditures and/or capital by collecting toll fees for a decade, \"starting from 1968 or until it accumulated $6.1 million, whichever came first.\" CDCP, however, requested that the duration be extended, as well the amount increased, justifying that their cost of operations had also inflated, and that they were held responsible \"not only to maintain the highways but also to improve and 'expand' them.\" Although a TRB report showed evidence that CDCP has amassed $25.6 million already in one year alone from 1976–77, TRB approved their request and extended the duration to thirty years. Presidential Decrees (PD) 1112 and 1113 in 1977 also imposed an increase in toll rates, forcing the public to pay steep fees that would primarily benefit CDCP and Cuenca's pocket. During a 1975 toll hike, buses boycotted the NLEX and SLEX roads. The Marcos administration retaliated by releasing a PD that closed service roads for buses, which then had no choice to pass through the expressways.\n\nIn 1974, the Marcos administration and the CDCP tapped Japanese Official Development Assistance (ODA) loans to build the San Juanico Bridge, which crossed the San Juanico Strait and connected the two then-underdeveloped islands of Leyte and Samar. With a total length of , it remains the longest bridge spanning a body of seawater in the Philippines.\n\nIt was touted as President Ferdinand Marcos' \"birthday gift\" to his wife Imelda,and it was one of the high-visibility foreign-loan projects initiated by Marcos during the run-up to the 1969 Presidential election campaign. Completed four years later, it was inaugurated on July 2, 1973 - Imelda Marcos' birthday.\n\nUpon its completion, economists and public works engineers tagged it as a white elephant which was \"constructed several decades too soon\", because its average daily traffic (ADT) was too low to justify the cost of its construction. As a result, its construction has been associated with what has been called the Marcoses' \"edifice complex\".\n\nIn the decades after the Marcoses administration, economic activity in Samar and Leyte has finally caught up with the bridge's intended function, and it has become an iconic tourist attraction acknowledged as \"part of the identity of people in Samar and Leyte.\"\n\nCDCP, again at Imelda's behest sought out a land reclamation project in Manila Bay. They were to construct an artificial 240-hectare white beach behind the Cultural Center of the Philippines. The rationale of the project was to create a 'Cannes' vibe for the international visitors of the Manila Film Festival. The white sand was quarried from the cities of Mariveles and Cavite. This area is now known to be the Manila Bay Freeport Zone. Also at Imelda's command, CDCP and other companies worked to create a \"huge complex of native-style pavilions\" for representatives of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in their 1979 conference in Manila. The complex became a ghost town throughout the 1980s.\n\nAnother project of the CDCP was the Light Rail Transit (LRT), this time partly financed by a $40 million loan from the Belgian government. A study of the World Bank in 1977 challenged the intentions of the project, stating that Manila needed a street-level transport system, not a 'high-flyer'. A street-level transport system would also cost much cheaper, with only a $8.1 million estimate, compared to the $278 million over-all cost for the LRT. Despite these skepticisms, Marcos permitted Cuenca to begin construction in October 1981.\n\nOther projects the CDCP under Cuenca handled were the Pantabangan Dam, and the Candaba Viaduct.\n\nCuenca eventually invited Roberto Ongpin to take his place as CDCP chairman, although Cuenca kept his position as president, and \"7% ownership\" of the firm.\n\nOn July 24, 1987, the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) filed a case whose respondents included Cuenca and his son Roberto, Imelda Marcos, Roberto Ongpin, former Philippine National Bank president Panfilo O. Domingo, Development Bank of the Philippines officer Don Ferry, and eleven others, claiming that the respondents had engaged in “schemes, devices or stratagems” to acquire ill-gotten wealth.\nOn August 5, 2010, the Sandiganbayan dismissed the case after throwing out 60 of the 100 documentary exhibits presented by the PCGG at the trial because they were photocopies, rather than original copies of the documents. The 27-page decision penned by Sandiganbayan Associate Justice Alex L. Quiroz, asserted that “since the due execution and authenticity of said photocopied documents had not been proved, the same were inadmissible in evidence. Further, the documents in question were rendered inadmissible as they were only photocopies.”\n\nIn June 2018, the Philippine Supreme Court’s First Division dismissed the complaint of the PCGG against the 2010 Sandiganbayan ruling, stating that the Supreme Court was not able to review the evidence in order to rule on the PCGG’s complaint. The 28-page decision penned by Supreme Court Associate Justice Noel Tijam said that: \"In order to determine the veracity of the Republic's main contention that it has established a prima facie case against respondents through its documentary and testimonial evidence, a reassessment and reexamination of the evidence is necessary<nowiki>[….]</nowiki> Unfortunately, the limited and discretionary judicial review allowed under Rule 45 does not envision a re-evaluation of the sufficiency of the evidence upon which respondent court's action was predicated. \"\n\nThe PCGG released a press statement reacting to the decision, saying \"Although the complaint was filed by the PCGG more than 31 years ago, and the Supreme Court decision was a mere affirmation of the Sandiganbayan ruling 8 years ago, the present officials of PCGG will still exhaust all possible legal remedies to pursue the case and to protect government interest.” \n\nIn the 2000s, Cuenca sought out authors Jose Dalisay Jr. and Antonette Reyes to write his biography, which was eventually published in September 2010 under the title \"Builder of Bridges: the Rudy Cuenca Story\".\n\nJournalist Amando Doronila, who had himself been one of the first critics arrested when Marcos proclaimed martial law in 1972, noted that \"\"the book is the first time a Marcos crony or a senior functionary has written about his role in the Marcos hierarchy,\" adding that in the book, \"Rodolfo Cuenca who admits to being a Marcos crony, reveals for the first time an insider’s view of the heightening rivalry among power blocs within the Marcos inner circle as the dictator’s health started to deteriorate in 1983... The book reveals the corruption and the corrosive tensions among the Marcos’ Palace elite that contributed to its downfall during the last three years of the dictatorship.\"\"\n\n"}

{"id": "317282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=317282", "title": "Science policy", "text": "Science policy\n\nScience policy is concerned with the allocation of resources for the conduct of science towards the goal of best serving the public interest. Topics include the funding of science, the careers of scientists, and the translation of scientific discoveries into technological innovation to promote commercial product development, competitiveness, economic growth and economic development. Science policy focuses on knowledge production and role of knowledge networks, collaborations and the complex distributions of expertise, equipment and know-how. Understanding the processes and organizational context of generating novel and innovative science and engineering ideas is a core concern of science policy. Science policy topics include weapons development, health care and environmental monitoring.\n\nScience policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve science. A large and complex web of factors influences the development of science and\nengineering that includes government science policy makers, private firms (including both national and multi-national firms), social\nmovements, media, non-governmental organizations, universities, and other research institutions. In addition, science policy is increasingly international as defined by the global operations of firms and research institutions as well as by the collaborative networks of non-governmental\norganizations and of the nature of scientific inquiry itself. \n\nState policy has influenced the funding of public works and science for thousands of years, dating at least from the time of the Mohists, who inspired the study of logic during the period of the Hundred Schools of Thought, and the study of defensive fortifications during the Warring States period in China. General levies of labor and grain were collected to fund great public works in China, including the accumulation of grain for distribution in times of famine, for the building of levees to control flooding by the great rivers of China, for the building of canals and locks to connect rivers of China, some of which flowed in opposite directions to each other, and for the building of bridges across these rivers. These projects required a civil service, the scholars, some of whom demonstrated great mastery of hydraulics.\n\nIn Italy, Galileo noted that individual taxation of minute amounts could fund large sums to the State, which could then fund his research on the trajectory of cannonballs, noting that \"each individual soldier was being paid from coin collected by a general tax of pennies and farthings, while even a million of gold would not suffice to pay the entire army.\"\n\nIn Great Britain, Lord Chancellor Sir Francis Bacon had a formative effect on science policy with his identification of \"experiments of .. light, more penetrating into nature [than what others know]\", which today we call the crucial experiment. Governmental approval of the Royal Society recognized a scientific community which exists to this day. British prizes for research spurred the development of an accurate, portable chronometer, which directly enabled reliable navigation and sailing on the high seas, and also funded Babbage's computer.\n\nThe professionalization of science, begun in the nineteenth century, was partly enabled by the creation of scientific organizations such as the National Academy of Sciences, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, and State funding of universities of their respective nations. In the United States, a member of the National Academy of Sciences can sponsor a Direct Submission for publication in the \"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\". \"PNAS\" serves as a channel to recognize research of importance to at least one member of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nPublic policy can directly affect the funding of capital equipment, intellectual infrastructure for industrial research, by providing tax incentives to those organizations who fund research. Vannevar Bush, director of the office of scientific research and development for the U.S. government in July 1945, wrote \"Science is a proper concern of government\" Vannevar Bush directed the forerunner of the National Science Foundation, and his writings directly inspired researchers to invent the hyperlink and the computer mouse. The DARPA initiative to support computing was the impetus for the Internet Protocol stack. In the same way that scientific consortiums like CERN for high-energy physics have a commitment to public knowledge, access to this public knowledge in physics led directly to CERN's sponsorship of development of the World Wide Web and standard Internet access for all.\n\nThe programs that are funded are often divided into four basic categories: basic research, applied research, development, and facilities and equipment. Translational research is a newer concept that seeks to bridge the gap between basic science and practical applications.\n\nBasic science attempts to stimulate breakthroughs. Breakthroughs often lead to an explosion of new technologies and approaches. Once the basic result is developed, it is widely published; however conversion into a practical product is left for the free market. However, many governments have developed risk-taking research and development organizations to take basic theoretical research over the edge into practical engineering. In the U.S., this function is performed by DARPA.\n\nOn the other hand, technology development is a policy in which engineering, the application of science, is supported rather than basic science. The emphasis is usually given to projects that increase important strategic or commercial engineering knowledge. The most extreme success story is doubtless the Manhattan Project that developed nuclear weapons. Another remarkable success story was the \"X-vehicle\" studies that gave the US a lasting lead in aerospace technologies.\n\nThese exemplify two disparate approaches: The Manhattan Project was huge, and spent unblinkingly on the most risky alternative approaches. The project members believed that failure would result in their enslavement or destruction by Nazi Germany. Each X-project built an aircraft whose only purpose was to develop a particular technology. The plan was to build a few cheap aircraft of each type, fly a test series, often to the destruction of an aircraft, and never design an aircraft for a practical mission. The only mission was technology development.\n\nA number of high-profile technology developments have failed. The US Space Shuttle failed to meet its cost or flight schedule goals. Most observers explain the project as over constrained: the cost goals too aggressive, the technology and mission too underpowered and undefined.\n\nThe Japanese fifth generation computer systems project met every technological goal, but failed to produce commercially important artificial intelligence. Many observers believe that the Japanese tried to force engineering beyond available science by brute investment. Half the amount spent on basic research rather might have produced ten times the result.\n\nUtilitarian policies prioritize scientific projects that significantly reduce suffering for larger numbers of people. This approach would mainly consider the numbers of people that can be helped by a research policy. Research is more likely to be supported when it costs less and has greater benefits. Utilitarian research often pursues incremental improvements rather than dramatic advancements in knowledge, or break-through solutions, which are more commercially viable/feasible.\n\nIn contrast, monumental science is a policy in which science is supported for the sake of a greater understanding of the universe, rather than for specific short-term practical goals. This designation covers both large projects, often with large facilities, and smaller research that does not have obvious practical applications and are often overlooked. While these projects may not always have obvious practical outcomes, they provide education of future scientists, and advancement of scientific knowledge of lasting worth about the basic building blocks of science.\n\nPractical outcomes do result from many of these \"monumental\" science programs. Sometimes these practical outcomes are foreseeable and sometimes they are not. A classic example of a monumental science program focused towards a practical outcome is the Manhattan project. An example of a monumental science program that produces unexpected practical outcome is the laser. Coherent light, the principle behind lasing, was first predicted by Einstein in 1916, but not created until 1954 by Charles H. Townes with the maser. The breakthrough with the maser led to the creation of the laser in 1960 by Theodore Maiman. The delay between the theory of coherent light and the production of the laser was partially due to the assumption that it would be of no practical use.\n\nThis policy approach prioritizes efficiently teaching all available science to those who can use it, rather than investing in new science. In particular, the goal is not to \"lose\" any existing knowledge, and to find new practical ways to apply the available knowledge. The classic success stories of this method occurred in the 19th century U.S. land-grant universities, which established a strong tradition of research in practical agricultural and engineering methods. More recently, the Green Revolution prevented mass famine over the last thirty years. The focus, unsurprisingly, is usually on developing a robust curriculum and inexpensive practical methods to meet local needs.\n\nMost developed countries usually have a specific national body overseeing national science (including technology and innovation) policy. In the case developing countries many follow the same fashion. Many governments of developed countries provide considerable funds (primarily to universities) for scientific research (in fields such as physics and geology) as well as social science research (in fields such as economics and history). Much of this is not intended to provide concrete results that may be commercialisable, although research in scientific fields may lead to results that have such potential. Most university research is aimed at gaining publication in peer reviewed academic journals.\n\nA funding body is an organisation that provides research funding in the form of research grants or scholarships. Research councils are the funding bodies that are government-funded agencies engaged in the support of research in different disciplines and postgraduate funding. Funding from research councils is typically competitive. As a general rule, more funding is available in science and engineering disciplines than in the arts and social sciences.\n\nIn Australia, the two main research councils are the Australian Research Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council.\n\nIn Canada, the three main research councils (\"Tri-Council\") are the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR). Additional research funding agencies include the Canada Foundation for Innovation, Genome Canada, Sustainable Development Technology Canada and several Tri-Council supported Networks of Centres of Excellence. \n\nIn Brazil, two important research agencies are the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq, Portuguese: Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico), an organization of the Brazilian federal government under the Ministry of Science and Technology, and São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP, Portuguese: Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo), a public foundation located in the state of São Paulo, Brazil .\n\nThe science policy of the European Union is carried out through the European Research Area, which is a system that integrates the scientific resources of member nations and acts as a \"common market\" for research and innovation purpose. The European Union's executive body, the European Commission, has a Directorate-General for Research; which is responsible for the Union's science policy. In addition, the Joint Research Centre provides independent scientific and technical advice to the European Commission and Member States of the European Union (EU) in support of EU policies. There is also the recently established European Research Council, the first European Union funding body set up to support investigator-driven research.\n\nThere are also European science agencies that operate independently of the European Union, such as the European Science Foundation, European Space Agency, and the European Higher Education Area; which are created by the Bologna process.\n\nOn science policy and on the European Research Area is grounded the European environmental research and innovation policy, which addresses global challenges of pivotal importance for the well-being of the European citizens within the context of sustainable development and environmental protection. Research and innovation in Europe is financially supported by the programme Horizon 2020, which is also open to participation worldwide.\n\nGerman research funding agencies include the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, which covers both science and humanities.\n\nResearch funding by the Government of India comes from a number of sources. For basic science and technology research, these include the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Department of Science and Technology (DST), and University Grants Commission (UGC). For medical research, these include the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), CSIR, DST and Department of Biotechnology (DBT). For applied research, these include the CSIR, DBT and Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC).\n\nOther funding authorities are the Defence Research Development Organisation (DRDO), the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the Department of Ocean Development (DOD), the Indian Council for Social Science Research (ICSSR), and the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MEF) etc.\n\nIrish funding councils include the Irish Research Council (IRC) and the Science Foundation Ireland. The prior Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology (IRCSET) and the Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences (IRCHSS) were merged to form the IRC in March 2012.\n\nDutch research funding agencies include Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO) and Agentschap NL .\n\nThe Government of Pakistan has mandated that a certain percentage of gross revenue generated by all telecom service providers be allocated to development and research of information and communication technologies. The National ICT R&D Fund was established in January 2007.\n\nUnder the Soviet Union, much research was routinely suppressed.\nNow science in Russia is supported by state and private funds. From the state: the Russian Humanitarian Scientific Foundation (http://www.rfh.ru), the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (www.rfbr.ru), the Russian Science Foundation (http://rscf.ru)\n\nSwiss research funding agencies include the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), the innovation promotion agency CTI (CTI/KTI), Ressortforschung des Bundes , and Eidgenössische Stiftungsaufsicht .\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Haldane principle, that decisions about what to spend research funds on should be made by researchers rather than politicians, is still influential in research policy. There are several university departments with a focus on science policy, such as the Science Policy Research Unit. There are seven grant-awarding Research Councils:\n\nThe United States has a long history of government support specially for science and technology. Science policy in the United States is the responsibility of many organizations throughout the federal government. Much of the large-scale policy is made through the legislative budget process of enacting the yearly federal budget. Further decisions are made by the various federal agencies which spend the funds allocated by Congress, either on in-house research or by granting funds to outside organizations and researchers.\n\nResearch funding agencies in the United States are spread among many different departments, which include:\n\n\n"}

Regulation FD or Reg FD), is that it creates an uneven playing field for investors, allowing some investors to profit from material market moving information before others.\n\nAn example of a selective disclosure could go as follows: A company insider tells a small group of Wall Street analysts that the company is going to beat current analyst consensus estimates for earnings per share. If this is the first time the company disclosed such guidance, and the guidance wasn't simultaneously disseminated to all investors via a press release or publicized webcast, then the disclosure would constitute selective disclosure.\n"}
{"id": "44311237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44311237", "title": "Sergio Tasselli", "text": "Sergio Tasselli\n\nSergio Tasselli is an Italian-Argentinian businessman. He is the head of one of the largest business groups in Argentina and has been called “the most successful businessman of recent times” in that country.\n\nAs of 2004, he has been running “twenty companies operating in the generation and distribution of power, metallurgy (Materfer, Electroaleaciones, Aceros Zapla), petrochemicals (Bermúdez), agricultural machinery (Agrinar), and the food sector (Bruning Mill).” His offices are on Avenida Cerviño, in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of Palermo.\n\nTasselli has been described as having benefited greatly from the program of privatization during the Menem presidency and then having profited under the subsequent presidencies of Nestor Kirchner and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. The Argentinian media routinely describe him as a “K businessman,” or Kirchner businessman – that is, someone who has profited from his connections to the Kirchner regime. \"La Nación\" stated in 2004 that here is “always a pall of suspicion” hanging over his businesses. His alleged mismanagement of several branches of the national railway has been faulted for deadly train accidents, and a mining accident that killed 14 people in 2004 in the province of Santa Cruz was attributed to his alleged mismanagement of the mines.\n\nHe has been investigated, prosecuted, and fined for many irregularities in the conduct of his businesses, but has not yet been imprisoned.\n\nTasselli was born on November 10, 1944. He was born in Italy and moved to Argentina as a small child.\n\nAs a young man, he was reportedly a member of the Montoneros, a left-wing guerrilla and subversive group of the 1960s and 70s.\n\nAccording to \"La Nación\", Tasselli built a group of businesses “practically from the ground up” with help from his political contacts, most of them members of the circle surrounding President Menem circle. He has been described as having built his empire by taking control of privatized companies and buying factories in auctions. According to \"La Nación\", Tasselli “became a specialist in closing deals with the state.” \"Indymedia\" describes Tasselli as having been a “front man” for Menem, benefiting from “all the government concessions” during Menem's presidency. “Because of subsidies received from the government,” Indymedia maintains, “Tasselli is the most powerful businessman in Argentina.”\n\nTasselli's relationship with the Kirchner family reportedly began in 1994, when he was put in charge of the concession of Yacimientos Carboníferos Fiscales. A September 2004 \"Indymedia\" article was headlined “Sergio Tasselli: Kirchner Has His Yabrán,” a reference to Alfredo Yabrán, a businessman who had profited through his intimate connection to the government of Carlos Menem.\n\nEarly in his career, he is said to have kept a “low profile.” As of July 2003, he had reportedly never granted an interview and declined to be photographed. In that year, \"La Nación\" called him “a new strongman in the business world,” said that “Taccelli is quietly building an economic empire,” and stated that his group of companies was growing “in the shadows.” \"La Nación\" noted that Tasselli's “associates generally do not come from the world of business but from the world of politics, such as former Montoneros leader Mario Montoto.”\n\nTasselli runs such firms as the Grupo Metropolitano and the electricity companies Edecat (Catamarca) and Edefor (Formosa), but he is not legally listed as the owner or principal shareholder of most of his firms. Instead, the companies are listed variously in the names of his five children and his brother Alberto.\n\nHe was a principal shareholder of Electromat, which withdrew from the stock market in 2003.\n\nTasselli's other firms include, or have included, Trainmet SA, Trainmet Servicios SA, Tecnica Industrial SA, Socieded Inmobiliaria del Nuevo Puerto, General Plasticos SA, CES SA, Alta Tension SA, Circum SA, SI GE SA, WLI Servicios SA, Compania Desmonte SA, Trainmet Ciccone Servicios SA, Finca Los Alerces SA, Mic. Inversiones Peri SA, Yacimientos del Sur SA, Flio Morado 53, IATE – Astra SA, IATE – Y.P.F., Zapla Holdings SA, Trainmet Seguros SA, Centrales Termicas SA, Centrales Termicas del NEA SA, Centrales Termicas Patagonica SA, Centrales Termicas Sorrento SA, Transnea SA, Transnoa SA, Empresa de Distribucion de Energia Electrica SA, IATE SA, Rafaela Alimentos SA, Retroquimica Bermudez SA, Red de los Supermercados SA, Curticor SA, San Jorge Mayorista de Alimentos SA, Materfer SA.\n\nTasselli took over the Yacimiento Rio Turbio (YCRT) coal mines in Santa Cruz after they were privatized in 1994, and ran them until 2001. YCRT was the first business to be de-privatized under Menem. Tasselli reportedly was granted the coal-mining concession at Rio Turbio because he had “become intimate with the Santa Cruz Front for Victory.” During the years when he ran YCRT, the Argentinian government paid $22.5 million annually in subsidies for the mines. Tasselli's control of the mines ended in a scandal that saw the mines re-nationalized in 2001.\n\nIn that year, miner Raul Wanzo, acting on behalf of the miners' union, sued Tasselli for mismanagement, corruption, smuggling, and other charges. During Tasselli's tenure, the number of miners had reportedly dropped by more than three quarters, safety measures deteriorated, and production declined. Also, when he took over the mines, he replaced contractors with his own firms. “Tasselli's management of Rio Turbio was worse than a war,” charged \"IndyMedia\". “They stole everything they could steal.” YCRT became “the first company to return to the state after being privatized during the decade the government of Carlos Menem.” The episode has been described as a “failed privatization.”\n\nWhen an explosion and collapse took place at one of the mines in 2004, killing 14 miners, Tasselli was accused of having caused it. Miners' union spokespeople attributed the mine disaster “directly to the lack of investment” in YCRT by Tasselli.\n\nA lawyer for the miners' union, Safrani Bernardino, directly accused Kirchner and Tasselli of responsibility for the 14 miners' deaths. Bernardino said that the workers had died as a consequence of “apathy” on the part of Tasselli and others who had made them “work as if they were animals.” \nThe miners were, Bernardino said, the victims of a “coincidence of interests and politics.” According to charges, he had not invested “a single penny of the $ 22.5 million received per year in subsidies” in new machinery, necessary safety measures, or in the opening of new mines. He was also accused of stealing company machinery, trucks, trains, and tools, and of importing machinery and vehicles tax-free through YCRT and then using them in other Tasselli-run companies. It was further charged that YCRF had lost money on suspicious payments to creditor firms that were mainly owned by him.\n\nIn May 2010, Federal Judge Sergio Torres summoned Tasselli to testify for possible crimes involving the alleged depletion of the Rio Turbio coal mine that occurred while he was running YCRT between 1994 and 2002. Tasselli was accused of diverting state assets to benefit his own companies, employing accounting maneuvers to evade taxes, violating various commitments, allowing rolling stock to be destroyed, among other charges. Torres cited a long list of YCRT assets that had been diverted to other firms. It was argued that these actions could well be responsible for the deadly mine accident of June 14, 2004. Tasselli was accused by Torres of emptying the coal company, mismanagement, smuggling, diverting state funds, engaging in accounting maneuvers to evade taxes, failing to return movable and immovable state property placed in his charge, allowing locomotives and rolling stock to fall into disrepair, and violating production commitments. On November 23, 2011, Torres ordered Tasselli to stand trial and ordered a seizing of his assets until the state could recover 45 million pesos that he was accused of having defrauded from YCRT.\n\nOn February 7, 2012, Wanzo filed with the Court of Appeals for recovery of assets that Tasselli had allegedly stolen from YCRT. Wanzo charged that Tasselli had “killed people with corruption” by “diverting subsidies provided to him by the State” to his own personal accounts. Wanzo stated that Tasselli had followed the same approach in Metropolitan, Rock-San Martin, Edecat SA, Parmalat SA, Acepar, and other companies under his control, taking money from government subsidies “at the cost of death and destruction of jobs.” In mid March 2014, at the request of prosecutor Federico Delgado, Torres summoned Tasselli for questioning on March 26, 2014.\n\nHis electrical firm in Catamarca, Edecat, was allegedly involved in 2003 in what La Nacion described as a $10 million “scam.”\n\nThe Tasselli group also ran the firm Altos Hornos de Zapla, which was privatized under Menem. Senator Gerardo Morales announced in January 2004 that the national government would cease dealings with the firm, citing an alleged breach of contract.\n\nTasselli began his involvement in the railway sector in 2000. His firm Metropolitano is the concessionaire for the railway lines Belgrano south and San Martin. It was also the concessionaire for the Roca line, which was returned to the state “in the midst of allegations of deficiencies in the services provided.” As of 2004, Metropolitano was billing $650 million a year and employed 12,000 people. In July of that year, he was engaged in a “full legal dispute with the government over the decision to rescind the contract to operate the San Martin branch” as well. During that dispute, he said that he was being “persecuted” by Transportation Secretary Ricardo Jaime.\n\nDuring the 1990s and 2000s, Tasselli was the defendant in many court cases involving his mismanagement of the rail services.\n\nIn December 2002, the Duhalde government passed a measure under which Tasselli, as owner of Metropolitano, was given 400,000 pesos a day in government subsidies while, according to widespread complaints, not investing any of that money in the railroad. Critics of his management of the railway assets have long objected to what they describe as a suspect relationship between Tasselli and the Minister of Planning and Public Investment, Julio De Vido. One point of contention was his dismissal of what was described as “the effective staff of former Ferrocarriles Argentinos,” which had provided the railway lines with maintenance and security, and hired in its place an allegedly less efficient company called Industrial Technical SA, which is owned by the Tasselli group. Moreover, Tasselli was accused of stealing machinery, tools, lathes, and other equipment from the railroads that ended up “as if by magic” at other Tasselli firms. “Tasselli would never have carried out such theft without the complicity of the government,” maintained IndyMedia.\n\nA March 2014 report by the Senate General Audit Office stated that 120 people had died and 1500 sustained wounds on Argentinian trains between 2002 and 2012. The crashes mainly involved trains run by Tasselli's firm Metropolitano.\n\nIn September 2004, Tasselli bought the Argentinian subsidiary of the Italian dairy group Parmalat. He acquired his stake in Parmalat Argentina through his firm Molinos Bruning. Tasselli reportedly bought Parmalat Argentina with a token payment of one euro and, as a result of the purchase, acquired debts of over 200 million pesos. Ten days after taking control of Parmalat Argentina, in order to restructure the firm, whose name they had changed to Compañía Láctea del Sur, Tasselli's group filed for bankruptcy on behalf of the firm.\n\nAmong the many firms run by Tasselli is the electrical firm Centrales Térmicas Patagónicas, which owns electrical generators in Puerto Madryn, Comodoro Rivadavia, and Pico Truncado, filed for reorganization in June 2009. At the time it was owned 17% by Sergio Tasselli, 17% by IATE (a firm owned by Tasselli and his brother Alberto), 17% by Luz y Fuerza, 25.88% by Chubut, 13.12% by the Argentinian government, and 10% by its employees.\n\nTasselli was the principal shareholder in the Santa Fe electrical firm Sorrento as of August 2009. In that month it was reported that he had dismissed more than 60 employees of Sorrento. His action was denounced by the workers' union, which charged that he planned to close the plant and sell it off. He denied that he had such plans and said that it was legally impossible to sell the plant because of contractual requirements.\n\nIt was reported on May 21, 2012, that Tasselli was “on the verge of a public trial for allegedly defrauding his own brother, Alberto Tasselli, of almost $2 million” and that the Court of Criminal Appeal had just rejected a request filed by Tasselli's lawyer, Mariano Di Meglio, to dismiss a March 8 decision to prosecute him for fraud. Tasselli was accused by his brother of “abusing his powers of attorney” in 1993 “to divert to his or others' advantage sums of money belonging to the company IATE SA” in a matter involving another firm, NEP SA.\n\nIn March 2001 Tasselli, as proxy for IATE SA, reportedly transferred $1,150,000 in company funds to an account in his name at Bank Boston NA in Montevideo. Some months later, he transferred $800,000.\n\nTasselli said in August 2005 that Paraguayan steelmaker Acepar, of which he was president, was up to date on payments to that country's government. His statement followed a request by President Nicanor Duarte that Acepar pay its total debt to Paraguay of some $24 million from its 1997 privatization. Nicolás Caballero, general secretary of Acepar's union Sitrasa, said there was evidence that Acepar had not invested sufficiently in the steel mill. “The machinery is in a dreadful state, they are neither buying supplies to guarantee normal plant operation nor is there a clear sales policy from the management,” he said.\n\nTasselli's firm Molinos Bruning, based in Santa Fe, was sued in provincial federal court by the AFIP for tax evasion. Complaints about irregularities in the firm led to three searches, performed at two locations in Santa Fe (San Jorge and Rosario) and one in Tucumán.\n\nA September 2009 report stated that private flights by Nestor and Cristina Kirchner had cost an average of $100,000 a month, and that one of the planes on which they had flown was a Lear Jet owned by Tasselli's son Mariano.\n\nThe Argentinian government fined Edesur $280,000 for breach of contract.\n\nLa Federación Económica de Catamarca (FEC) said that the provincial government should terminate a concession contract with Edecat SA because of lack of investment, poor service, and overcharging. Edecat, however, ignored resolutions by the FEC and by the provincial government calling on it to improve its performance.\n\nIn 2011 Tasselli began to run the dairy firm Gándara, an enterprise that ended in bankruptcy.\n\nTasselli was accused in 2013 of becoming involved in the steel mill Aceros del Paraguay (Acepar) in an illegal manner. According to a Paraguayan newspaper, since the Paraguayan government was the main shareholder of Aceros, and since the firm owed the government money, Tasselli could not legally become its majority shareholder, which he did, without paying the debt, which he did not.\n\nIt was reported on August 17, 2013, that Tasselli had a Swiss bank account for the Edefor firm in the amount of $5.4 million, and that he was being investigated for money laundering by the Finance Intelligence Unit Suisse. He reportedly held several Swiss accounts in his own name. Among the irregular transactions investigated by the Swiss was a transfer of $7.4 million from an account in his name n ABN Amro Bank to another Dutch account. Also he transferred almost $20 million from the Royal Bank of Canada to an account in Geneva in his name. Also, he deposited $3 million in various Swiss banks. The suspicious deposits took place between August 2003 and April 2009. Swiss authorities asked Tasselli to explain the transactions but as of August 7 had received no reply. Consequently, Swiss federal prosecutor Frederic Schaller requested cooperation in the matter from Argentina's Ministry of Justice.\n\nGustavo Correa, president of Vetorial Brazil, denied in August 2014 that his firm, which had taken control of Aceros del Paraguay (Acepar) had any relationship with Tasselli, who was accused of having left the company's coffers empty until it reached the brink of bankruptcy.\n\nIn 2000 the union of Argentinian government workers, ATE, popularized a slogan: “Tasselli Out!”\n"}
{"id": "42713", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42713", "title": "Special Olympics", "text": "Special Olympics\n\nThe Special Olympics is the world's largest sports organization for children and adults with intellectual disabilities, providing year-round training and competitions to 5 million athletes and Unified Sports partners in 172 countries. Special Olympics competitions are held every day, all around the world—including local, national and regional competitions, adding up to more than 100,000 events a year. Like the International Paralympic Committee, the Special Olympics organization is recognized by the International Olympic Committee; however, unlike the Paralympic Games, Special Olympics World Games are not held in the same year or in conjunction with the Olympic Games.\n\nThe Special Olympics World Games is a major event put on by the Special Olympics. The World Games alternate between summer and winter games, in two-year cycles, recurring every fourth year. The first games were held on July 20, 1968 in Chicago, Illinois, with about 1000 athletes from the U.S. and Canada. International participation expanded in subsequent games. In 2003, the first summer games held outside the United States were in Dublin, Ireland with 7000 athletes from 150 countries. The most recent World Summer Games were held in Los Angeles, California (The largest event in LA since the 1984 Olympic Games), from July 25, 2015 to August 2, 2015. This was the first time that the Special Olympics were part of ESPN daily coverage. The next World Summer Games will be held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates in March 2019. These will be the first Special Olympics World Games to be held in the Middle East.\n\nThe first World Winter Games were held in 1977 in Steamboat Springs, Colorado. Austria hosted the first Winter Games outside the United States in 1993. The most recent Special Olympics World Winter Games were held in Graz, Schladming and Ramsau, Austria from March 14, 2017 to March 25, 2017 (see also 2017 Special Olympics World Winter Games). During the World Winter Games of 2013 in Pyeongchang, South Korea the first Special Olympics Global Development Summit was held on \"Ending the Cycle of Poverty and Exclusion for People with Intellectual Disabilities,\" gathering government officials, activists and business leaders from around the world.\n\nIn June 1962, Eunice Kennedy Shriver started a day camp called Camp Shriver for children with intellectual disabilities at her home in Potomac, Maryland. She started this camp because of concern about children with intellectual disabilities having very little opportunity to participate in athletic events. Using Camp Shriver as an example, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who was head of the Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. Foundation and part of President John F. Kennedy's Panel on Mental Retardation, promoted the concept of involvement in physical activity and other opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities. Camp Shriver became an annual event, and the Kennedy Foundation (of which Eunice became director in 1957) gave grants to universities, recreation departments and community centers to hold similar camps.\n\nIt was also in the early 1960s that Eunice Kennedy Shriver wrote an article in the Saturday Evening Post, revealing that her sister Rosemary, also President John F. Kennedy's sister, was born with intellectual disabilities. This frank article about the President's family was seen as a \"watershed\" in changing public attitudes toward people with intellectual disabilities. Shiver's inspiration for her work came from Rosemary's disability, and provided her with an overall vision that people with intellectual disabilities could compete and unify the public that come from all different situations. It has often been said that Rosemary's disability was Eunice's inspiration to form Special Olympics (as the movement came to be called), but she told \"The New York Times\" in 1995 that that was not exactly the case. \"The games should not focus on one individual,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1958, Dr. James N. Oliver of England was conducting pioneering research, including a ground-breaking study showing that physical exercise and activities for children with intellectual disabilities had positive effects that also carried over into the classroom (\"The Effects of Physical Conditioning Exercises and Activities on the Mental Characteristics of Educationally Sub-Normal Boys, British Journal of Educational Psychology, XXVIII, June 1958). Dr. Oliver would later (1964) serve as consultant to Camp Shriver, the forerunner to Special Olympics.\n\nThe 1964 research of Dr. Frank Hayden, a Canadian physical education professor from London, Ontario, had shown that persons with intellectual disabilities can and should participate in physical exercise. Moreover, he believed that the benefits of such activity would be seen in all areas of the athletes' lives. And so, with the help of a local school that offered space in its gym, one of the first organised sports programs floor hockey for individuals with intellectual disabilities became available in the fall of 1968. In the mid-1960s, he developed an idea for national games, and his work brought him to the attention of the Kennedy Foundation. He shared his ideas for national games, while taking a teaching sabbatical and working for the foundation.\n\nThe first Special Olympics games were held in July 1968 at Soldier Field in Chicago. About 1,000 athletes from the U.S. and Canada took part in the one-day event, which was a joint venture by the Kennedy Foundation and the Chicago Park District. Anne McGlone Burke, then a physical education teacher with the Chicago Park District, began with the idea for a one-time, city-wide, Olympic-style athletic competition for people with special needs. Burke approached the Kennedy Foundation in 1967 to fund the event. Eunice, in turn, encouraged her to expand the idea beyond the city and the foundation provided a grant of $25,000. When Burke had approached another charity for funding, she was told, \"You should be ashamed of yourself putting these kinds of kids on display\". The advisory committee to the Chicago Special Olympics included Dr. William Freeberg, Southern Illinois University; Dr. Hayden of the Kennedy Foundation; Dr. Arthur Peavy; Burke, William McFetridge, and Stephen Kelly of the Chicago Park District; and Olympic decathlon champion Rafer Johnson. Eunice Kennedy Shriver was honorary chair. At the July 1968 games, Shriver announced the formation of Special Olympics and that more games would be held every two years as a \"Biennial International Special Olympics\". Hayden served as the games executive director through 1972, and then in international development for the games.\n\nIn 1971, The U.S. Olympic Committee gave the Special Olympics official approval to use the name \"Olympics\". France sent the first athletes from outside North America to the second games held in 1970. The third games in 1972 saw 10 nations send athletes The first Special Olympics World Winter Games were held in February 1977 in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, U.S. The United Nations declared 1986, the year of the Special Olympics. In 1988, the Special Olympics was officially recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The first World Games held outside the U.S., were the winter games of 1993 in Salzburg and Schladming, Austria. The Austrian president was the first head of state to personally open the games.\n\nIn 1997, Healthy Athletes became an official Special Olympics initiative, offering health information and screenings to Special Olympics athletes worldwide. By 2010, the Healthy Athletes program had given free health screenings and treatment to more than 1 million people with intellectual disabilities.\nIn 2003 the first Special Olympics World Summer Games to be held outside of the United States took place in Dublin, Ireland. Approximately 7,000 athletes from 150 countries competed over 18 disciplines. The Dublin games were also the first to have their own opening and closing ceremonies broadcast live. President of Ireland Mary McAleese performed the ceremonial duties. The 2003 games dramatically changed the perceptions and attitudes of international society regarding the abilities and limitations of people with intellectual disabilities. The opening ceremony of the 2003 Games has been described by President McAleese as \"a time when Ireland was at its superb best\".\n\nOn October 30, 2004, President George W. Bush signed into law the \"Special Olympics Sport and Empowerment Act,\" Public Law 108-406. The bill authorized funding for its Healthy Athletes, Education, and Worldwide Expansion programs. Co-sponsored by Representatives Roy Blunt (R-MO), and Steny Hoyer (D-MD), and Senators Rick Santorum (R-PA) and Harry Reid (D-NV), the bills were passed by unanimous consent in both chambers. In July 2006, the first Special Olympics USA Games were held at Iowa State University. Teams from all 50 states and the District of Columbia participated.\n\nIn May 2016, Mary Davis of Dublin, Ireland was named Chief Executive Officer. She is the first CEO from outside the U.S. in the organization's history.\n\nThe Special Olympics logo is based on the sculpture \"Joy and Happiness to All the Children of the World\" by Zurab Tsereteli which was a gift to SUNY Brockport when the university hosted the Special Olympics in 1979. The logo has gone through several changes in its lifetime. The \"stick figure\" is an abstract but humanistic form designed to convey the impression of movement and activity. The logo is a symbol of growth, confidence and joy among children and adults with disabilities who are learning coordination, mastering skills, participating in competitions and preparing themselves for richer, more productive lives.\n\nIn 2018, the Chicago Park District erected the \"Eternal Flame of Hope\" in honor of the Special Olympics. The sculpture by Richard Hunt stands in a plaza next to Soldier Field, where the first games were held 50 years earlier in 1968. The Flame of Hope is the name given to the torch that is carried to and lit at Special Olympics games.\n\nSpecial Olympics programs are available for athletes free of charge. More than 5.7 million athletes and Unified Sports partners are involved in Special Olympics sports training and competition in 172 countries. The organization offers year-round training and competition in 32 Olympic-style summer and winter sports.\n\nPeople with intellectual disabilities are encouraged to join Special Olympics for the physical activity, which helps lower the rate of cardiovascular disease and obesity, among other health benefits. Also, they gain many emotional and psychological benefits, including self-confidence, social competence, building greater athletic skills and higher self-esteem. Exercise has also been shown to be related to a decrease in anxiety levels amongst people with intellectual disabilities.\n\nTo qualify for the special olympics, a person must be at least 8 years old and identified by an agency or professional as having one of the following conditions: intellectual disabilities, cognitive delays as measured by formal assessment, or significant learning or vocational problems due to cognitive delay that require or have required specially designed instruction. For young people with and without intellectual disabilities ages 2–7, Special Olympics has a Young Athletes program—an inclusive sport and play program with a focus on activities that are important to mental and physical growth. Children engage in games and activities that develop motor skills and hand-eye coordination. Parents say their children in Young Athletes also develop better social skills. The confidence boost makes it easier for them to play and talk with other children on the playground and elsewhere. A study by the Center for Social Development and Education (University of Massachusetts, Boston) found that the activities also had the effect of helping children with intellectual disabilities learn routines and approaches to learning, along with how to follow rules and directions.\n\nFamilies can also get involved with the Special Olympics experience. Family members support their athletes to the best of their ability, which may involve attending or volunteering at the events. By being involved they can boost their athlete's self-esteem and will be looked at as a constant source of encouragement.\n\nVolunteers and supporters are an integral part of Special Olympics—and millions of people around the world are committed to its programs. Some are sponsors or donors. Many others are coaches, event volunteers and fans.\n\nCoaches help the athletes be the best they can be regardless of ability—or disability. Special Olympics trains coaches through the Coaching Excellence program, which includes partnering with sports organizations. Special Olympics volunteers are introduced to lifetime friendships and great rewards.\n\nThere are many events in which families and volunteers participate, but the biggest event is the Law Enforcement Torch Run, which involves police chiefs, police officers, secret service, FBI agents, military police, sheriffs, state troopers, prison guards, and other law enforcement personnel assembling to raise awareness and funds for Special Olympics. Ahead of a Special Olympics competition, law enforcement officers carry the torch in intervals along a planned route covering most of the state or country to the site of the opening ceremonies of the chapter or Special Olympics World Summer or Winter Games. Then they pass the torch to a Special Olympics athlete and together they run up to the cauldron and light it, signifying the beginning of the games.\n\nThe Special Olympics athlete's oath, which was first introduced by Eunice Kennedy Shriver at the inaugural Special Olympics international games in Chicago in 1968, is \"Let me win. But if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt.\" The origin of the oath came from Herbert J. Kramer, then Public Relations Advisor to the Kennedy Foundation.\n\nIn 1968, track and field, swimming and floor hockey were the first three official sports offered by Special Olympics. As in the Olympics, events are introduced in training and then added to the competitive schedule, and from there the list of sports and events continued to grow.\n\nSpecial Olympics has more than 30 Olympic-type individual and team sports that provide meaningful training and competition opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities. As of 2016, these are:\nOther sports and sports-related programs include the Motor Activity Training Program and Beach Volleyball. Availability of sports can depend on location and season.\n\nA key difference between Special Olympics competitions and those of other sports organizations is that athletes of all ability levels are encouraged to participate. Competitions are structured so that athletes compete with other athletes of similar ability in equitable divisions. An athlete's ability is the primary factor in divisioning Special Olympics competitions. The ability of an athlete or team is determined by an entry score from a prior competition or the result of a seeding round or preliminary event at the competition itself. Other factors that are significant in establishing competitive divisions are age and gender.\n\nAt competitions, medals are awarded to the first, second and third-place winners in each event, and ribbons are awarded to athletes who finish in fourth through eighth place.\n\nIn recent years, Special Olympics has pioneered the concept of Unified Sports, bringing together athletes with and without intellectual disabilities as teammates. The basic concept is that training together and playing together can create a path to friendship and understanding. The program has expanded beyond the U.S. and North America: more than 1.4 million people worldwide now take part in Special Olympics Unified Sports. The goal is to break down stereotypes about people with intellectual disabilities and promote unity.\n\nA recent study of Special Olympics Unified Sports in Serbia, Poland, Ukraine, Germany and Hungary documented the program's benefits, including the effect of changing attitudes toward people with intellectual disabilities. As one Unified Sports partner said, \"I am ashamed to say that I used to laugh at these people (people with intellectual disabilities), now I will tell anybody to stop laughing if I see it and I will stand up for people if I can.\" Other evaluations have also shown Unified Sports to be successful in building self-esteem and confidence in people with intellectual disabilities and also as a way to improve understanding and acceptance of people with intellectual disabilities among their non-disabled peers.\n\nThe Special Olympics Europe Eurasia Regional Research centre is based at the University of Ulster Jordanstown and is jointly led by Professor Roy McConkey and Professor David Hassan.\n\nAs part of their 50th anniversary, the Special Olympics created the first Unified Cup. The first competition is a soccer tournament with 440 athletes from 24 countries.\n\nAs Special Olympics began to grow, staffers and volunteers began to notice that athletes—children and adults with intellectual disabilities—also had many untreated health problems. In 1997, Special Olympics began an initiative called Healthy Athletes, which offers health screenings to athletes in need.\n\nHealthy Athletes currently offers health screenings in seven areas: Fit Feet (podiatry), FUNfitness (physical therapy), Health Promotion (better health and well-being), Healthy Hearing (audiology), MedFest (sports physical exam), Opening Eyes (vision) and Special Smiles (dentistry). Screenings educate athletes on health and also identify problems that may need additional follow-up. For example, the FUNfitness Program assess flexibility, strength, balance, and aerobic fitness of the athlete. Following the screen, the physical therapist would provide instructions on how to optimize their physical fitness in the areas screened.\n\nSince the Healthy Athletes program began, Special Olympics has become the largest global public health organization dedicated to serving people with intellectual disabilities. So far, more than 1.9 million Healthy Athletes screenings have been conducted for people with intellectual disabilities all around the world.\n\nThe Special Olympics health initiative has attracted high-profile partners, including the Hear the World Foundation, which screened more than 1,000 athletes during the most recent World Winter Games in Korea; more than 200 of them were found to have hearing loss.\n\nIn 2012, the Special Olympics Healthy Communities initiative launched in eight countries—Kazakhstan, Malawi, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Romania, South Africa and Thailand, as well as six U.S. states. The goal is to improve the health and well-being of people with intellectual disabilities and allow them to reach their full potential.\n\nScholar Keith Storey summarized common objections in a 2004 article in \"Journal of Disability Policy Studies\". One criticism directed at the organization pertains to the role that corporate sponsors play in it, which critics feel has led to degrading paternalism toward athletic ability. While corporate fundraising makes the games possible, critics argue, it provides good public relations for the sponsors, but does not result in integration of people with disabilities into the workforce at those companies. People with disabilities are also not widely represented on the Special Olympics' board of directors, as only two members have disabilities. This has been criticized as a double-standard that reflects poorly on the disability rights movement where people with disabilities control the service delivery system rather than relying on people without disabilities.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "36997559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36997559", "title": "Workfare in the United Kingdom", "text": "Workfare in the United Kingdom\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"workfare\" refers to government workfare policies whereby individuals must undertake work in return for their benefit payments or risk losing them. Workfare policies are politically controversial. Supporters claim that such policies help people move off welfare and into employment (see Workfare) whereas critics argue that they are analogous to slavery or indentured servitude and counterproductive in decreasing unemployment.\n\nAlthough actual \"workfare\" only began in the UK in the early-1990s with the first Major government's \"Community Action\" scheme in 1993 which was replaced in 1996 with the better known \"Project Work\" which was subsequently replaced by New Labour's \"New Deal\", welfare to work or \"active labour market policies\" go back much earlier to 1986 and the second Thatcher government's introduction of compulsory \"Restart\" interviews for unemployed claimants. Restart lasted until 1991 when it was superseded by the \"make work\" scheme \"Employment Action\" which lasted until 1993. \"Make work schemes\" are not workfare as such, but are very much a composite part of welfare to work or \"active labour market policies\" aka \"welfare reform\". \n\nThe definition used here to distinguish between \"outright\" workfare, and \"make work schemes\", is that workfare is \"work for benefits\" either for a company, or in the public sector, or what has been called \"bogus volunteering\" for a charity. This is undertaken as the condition of still being able to claim unemployment benefit, as distinct from claimants receiving that but also being in receipt of \"a small supplemental payment\"<ref name=\"Work Schemes\"</ref>. </ref>. \n\nAs such, it can be argued that welfare to work/\"active labour market policies\" first properly appeared in the early 1980s along with mass unemployment, in the form of the state run Manpower Services Commission created by the Heath government in the early 1970s whilst Full Employment still existed, along with the Youth Opportunities Programme scheme first introduced by the Callaghan Labour government of the late-70s but being continued and further applied by the incoming Conservative government. The YOP was replaced in 1983 by the better-known Youth Training Scheme (YTS).\n\nAlthough workfare did exist in the 2000s under New Labour, it was not widely publicized or widely used. In the 2010s, under the Conservative-led coalition government it became widely used and widely known along with large scale and highly effective opposition which has continued under the Conservative government elected in 2015, leading to many dozens of organizations withdrawing from one or all of what were seven different schemes. This became five after the DWP announced in November 2015 that it was \"not renewing\" two of its flagship schemes, \"Community Work Placements\" and \"Mandatory Work Activity\".\n\nIn November 2011, the Prime Minister's Office announced proposals under which Jobseeker's Allowance claimants who haven't found a job once they have been through a work programme will do a 26-week placement in the community for 30 hours a week. According to The Guardian in 2012, under the Government's Community Action Programme people who have been out of work for a number of years \"must work for six months unpaid, including at profit-making businesses, in order to keep their benefits\".\n\nThese developments followed years of concern and discussion by people both for and against such schemes. In 1999, the UK charity Child Poverty Action Group expressed concern that a government announcement that single parents and the disabled may have to attend repeated interviews for jobs under threat of losing benefits was \"a step towards a US-style workfare system\". The Social Security Secretary at the time, Alistair Darling, described the plan as \"harsh, but justifiable\", claiming that it would help address the \"poverty of expectation\" of many people on benefits. In 2008 research undertaken by the Centre for Regional Economic and Social Research (CRESR) for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) found that there was little evidence that workfare programmes increased the likelihood of finding paid employment and could instead reduce the prospect of finding paid employment by \"limiting the time available for job search and by failing to provide the skills and experience valued by employers.\" Despite the report, Digby, Lord Jones, former Minister of State for Trade and Investment, said in April 2010 that Britain needs to adopt American-style workfare.\n\nDuring their 2013 annual conference the Conservative Party announced a new scheme, called Help to Work, the workfare aspect of which \"Community Work Placements\" expected claimants to work for up to 30 hours a week for 26 weeks in return for JSA (Job Seekers Allowance). The scheme was introduced in April 2014, but scrapped in November 2015.\n\nA myriad of contemporary workfare schemes exist, or existed until quite recently. The anti-workfare group Boycott Workfare list eight schemes involving the risk of benefit loss (directly and indirectly).\n\n\nIn 2012, right-wing political blogger Paul Staines argued in support of workfare on his blog \"Guido Fawkes\", writing:\n\n\nChris Grayling has attacked what he calls the \"Polly Toynbee left\" for failing to understand the modern labour market.\n\nThe Trade Union Congress (TUC), a federation of trade unions in the United Kingdom, has stated that workfare is exploitation of the unemployed, \"paying\" them below the minimum wage. The TUC also highlight that workfare is unfair to paid workers who find themselves in competition with unpaid workers. In these cases the TUC claims that the result would be job losses and the deterioration of pay, overtime or other conditions. Employers who opted not to use workfare workers would also find themselves competing with other firms who are \"effectively being subsidised\". \"The Guardian\" newspaper claimed in February 2012 that businesses in the UK which take staff via \"work for your benefits programmes\" included Asda, Maplin, Primark, Holland & Barrett, Boots, and McDonald's. The policy is similar to that which the Conservative Party administration hoped to introduce in the mid to late 1990s, which would most likely have been carried through had John Major not been defeated by Tony Blair in the 1997 general election. Critics also ascertain that the majority of menial, low paid jobs would end up being carried out by people on workfare who, because they are working but unpaid, would not be counted among the unemployment figures. In an article in the Huffington Post, Dr Simon Duffy likened workfare to slavery. The Green Party of England and Wales has also voiced its opposition to workfare. \n\nAcademics have argued that, as workfare participants are essentially providing work that is beneficial to the employer, whether public or private, they should be granted employment status (as a worker or an employee) or, at least, employment protection, even regardless of status.\n\nAcademic analysis by the Department of Work and Pensions has cast doubt on the effectiveness of workfare policies. After surveying the international evidence available from America, Canada and Australia the report states:\n\nOpposition to workfare has caused a number of companies to withdraw from \"workfare\" schemes. A number of organisations including Maplin, Waterstones, Sainsbury's, TK Maxx and the Arcadia Group withdrew from the scheme in early 2012. Argos and Superdrug announced they were suspending their involvement pending talks with ministers. Clothing retailer Matalan subsequently suspended its involvement in the scheme in order to conduct a review of the terms of such placements, with a spokesman for the DWP saying \"The scheme is voluntary and no one is forced to take part and the threat of losing the benefit only starts once a week has passed on the placement - this was designed to provide certainty to employers and the individuals taking part\"\n\nThere was controversy later in February 2012 following the involvement of the Tesco supermarket chain in a government workfare scheme linked to the payment of benefits. An advert appeared on the Jobseekers' Plus website in which Tesco sought permanent workers in exchange for expenses and jobseeker's allowance. After the advert was highlighted by users of Facebook and Twitter, the supermarket claimed its appearance was a mistake and that it was intended to be \"an advert for work experience with a guaranteed job interview at the end of it as part of a Government-led work experience scheme\". A protest about this advert later caused the temporary closure of a Tesco store near the Houses of Parliament.\n\nThe discount retailer Poundland's participation in a workfare scheme has been controversial. A graduate took the Department of Work and Pensions to Court arguing that participation in a workfare scheme was a breach of her human rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights. Caitlin Reilly and Jamieson Wilson lost the case but the decision was reversed on appeal. However, the appeal decision was made primarily on technical grounds, and the judge found no breach of Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights..\n\nHome Retail Group, the parent company of Argos and Homebase, were also widely criticised for their involvement in Workfare. It was reported they would not offer jobs to people who successfully completed the scheme (with Argos simply issuing certificates of completion to those wanting jobs). A key moment for those who opposed Workfare was when a poster produced for internal purposes by Homebase condoning that unpaid work in the scheme was a way of reducing operating costs, was leaked to the public. After this, Home Retail Group soon announced their discontinuation in the scheme.\n\n"}
