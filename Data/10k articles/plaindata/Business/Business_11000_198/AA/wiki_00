He is the Founder of ‘Raha TV” (2012).\n\nThe elders of Amir Hossein Jahanshahi’s family belong to the Kara Koyunlu clan which has a 500 year history of governing a number of key provinces in Iran. Based in Tabriz, the ‘Gharghoyonlou’ ruled over significant sectors of contemporary Iran, including Azerbaijan, Khuzestan, Kerman, Fars and Heart as well as parts of present day Iraq. The last ‘Gharghoyonlou’ ruler was Jahan Shah.\n\nA number of personalities from this clan were religious figures [‘Mojtahid’], who were considered as noble and notable figures in Azerbaijan after the 8th century.\n\nFollowing the establishment of ‘Adliehe Azam’ (Supreme Court) by Nasserdin Shah in the 19th century, these notables became leading members of the state judiciary. Prominent amongst these figures were ‘Mirza Mohammad Taghi Sadr Jahanshahi’ (the uncle of MirzaShafi Jahanshahi ) who headed the judiciary in Azarbaijan.\n\nIn 1946, Amir Hossein Jahanshahi’s grand father, Mirza Shafi Jahanshahi was appointed as the Head of Iran’s Supreme Court by Prime Minister ََAhmad Ghavam (‘Ghavomol-Saltaneh’). In the course of the elections to the 15th Majles (1947), Mirza Shafi was also the Head of the Supervisory Group for the elections in Teheran. His father, Gholam Hossein Jahanshahi was elected to the 19th (1956) and 20th Majles (1960), as Deputy from Teheran and pursuant to that, in the cabinet of Prime Minister Asadollah Alam in 1962, he was appointed as Minister of Trade. For a while, he also served as Deputy Head of the Pahlavi Foundation (Persian:).\n\nHis Maternal Grand Father was Khaz'al al-Ka'bi who was the governor of Khuzestan Province in the early 1920s.\n\nAmir Hossein Jahanshahi completed his education in France where he obtained degrees in Economics at the Panthéon-Assas University. Subsequent to completing his studies, he worked as a financial advisor and as a real estate developer in Paris, Madrid and Barcelona, before becoming a major stakeholder in large public companies such as Bouygues, Havas and Vivendi.\n\nConcerned adamantly about the rapid rise of radical fundamentalism in Iran and the Middle East, which he believes places the prospects of its future generations in serious jeopardy, his first book entitled, “Defeating the Third Totalitarianism” was published in December 2001 in the aftermath of ‘9/11’ attack on the World Trade Center in New York. The publication of his first book was followed by a series of articles published in major French newspapers and leading to the publication of his second book in September 2009, entitled “The Iranian Hitler – Putting anEnd to Ahmadinejad’s Dictatorship” \n\nA message published by the French newspaper, Le Figaro in October 2009, calling on all Iranian opposition groups - inside and outside the country as well as those within the governing regime – to be prepared to work with one another in a united effort to overthrow the ‘Ahmadinejad regime’, marked the official entrance of Jahanshahi into the political fray.\n\nIn March 2010, Amir Hossein Jahanshahi launched Green Wave with a new political agenda committed to serving the Iranian nation and preventing regional war and instability.\n\nJahanshahi and Green Wave soon became the main targets of the Iranian state’s propaganda machine in the administration of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Worried about activities pursued by Jahanshahi’s innovative outlook, commitment and dedication for achieving his objectives, in an unprecedented move not seen before, the Iranian State Television in 2011-2013 produced a total of three separate documentaries (‘Almase Farib’ I & II, 2011 and 2012) and (‘Triangle’, 2013) to directly damage and derail the activities of Green Wave in order to foil its activities aimed at promoting popular change in Iran and ending the scourge of radical fundamentalism in the region and beyond.\n\nIn September 2012, Amir Hossein Jahanshahi launched the first major opposition TV channel in London. ‘Raha’ (‘to free’) is dedicated to ‘change’ and is run by Iranian journalists who have recently left Iran as well as some working inside the country.\n\nAt Raha’s official launch in October 2012, Jahanshahi stated that “At this critical juncture in the history of Iran and the region people will want to watch in order to get news and analysis that they can trust as unbiased”. However, because ‘Raha TV’ poses a major challenge to policies carried out by hardliners and extremists within the ruling establishment, some of its transmissions have been subject to blockage though these activities have at no time deterred ‘Raha’ from overcoming these obstacles and getting its message to the Iranian people.\n\nIn line with his consistent concern that political change should never be sought at a cost of either subjecting the country to the threat of a destructive external military conflict or a situation of internal mayhem and civil war, Amir Hossein Jahanshahi supported the candidacy of Hassan Rouhani in the presidential election of June 2013, using all his various resources both inside and outside Iran. Later, on 26 September 2013, following the publication of a ‘Full Page Message’ printed in the International Herald Tribune (coinciding with the presence of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the General Assembly of the UN), he advanced a new initiative aimed at promoting ‘national reconciliation’ amongst contending factions that wish to retain centuries old traditions and the youth who are seeking a modern and progressive Iran.\n\nCommitted to the future rise of the Iranian people and aspiring to attain for Iran its rightful place in the community of nations consistent with its past history and great civilization, Jahanshahi has stressed the importance of economic reconstruction as a catalyst for future prosperity as well as the best guarantor for the establishment of a just and democratic order in Iran. \n\nPlacing ‘economic reconstruction’ at the top of all priorities, Jahanshahi has sought the cooperation of those anxious to retain the status quo and those committed to the construction of a different Iran, to come together with the explicit eventual aim of establishing reconciliation between civil society and government for the sake of restoring Iran’s damaged economic and social structures, thus allowing it to attain its rightful place amongst the top ten economies of the world within a single decade. \n\nIn the aftermath of his call for ‘National Reconciliation’, at his behest on the birthday of the ‘Prophet of Islam’ (in 2014), his close friend, the president of the ‘Real Madrid’ football club, in what was widely covered by the Iranian media, accepted his proposal to enter into direct into negotiations with the appropriate Iranian authorities, so that the European Club Champions may visit Iran and play a friendly match against the popular Iranian side Persepolis F.C. for the benefit of the Iranian people.\n\nIn order to implement the much need reconstruction of the Iranian economy, as well as securing some of the country’s most immediate vital requirements for the promotion of such a mission, in an interview with the French daily, Le Figaro on 7 February 2014, Amir Hossein Jahanshahi announced that he was willing to return to Iran without any precondition so that this important ‘national mission could be pursued with the Iranian people. He said that Iran belonged to all Iranians and relieving the hardships placed on the lives of all citizens while securing the country’s immediate needs was a critical requirement. According to Jahanshahi, preventing the kind of violence and social and economic catastrophes witnessed in countries like Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Egypt was a key priority and, as such, it was the duty for all Iranians who wanted to see their country restore its pride, dignity and former greatness.\n\nIn the course of a press conference held in Paris on 20th November 2014, Amir Hossein Jahanshahi announced that he would be ending his 35 years of exile and returning to Iran no later than Spring 2015. He said, In line with my natural obligations given these new circumstances, it is my intention that all my activities should be conducted in a framework that is in compliance with the laws of our country”.In a subsequent statement released in the aftermath of the Press Conference held on 20 November, on 8 December 2014, he announced that in light of these developments, Dr. Mehrdad Khonsari, the Secretary General of ‘Green Wave’, had, therefore suggested the dissolution of Green Wave, which he had accepted. Amir Hossein Jahanshahi, having at the same time announced the creation of the newly established Organization for ‘Economic Reconstruction and National Reconciliation’ (‘BAAM”), said that he had invited Dr. Mehrdad Khonsari to become the Secretary General of the new organization. This organization is to serve as an umbrella for providing support for economic reconstruction and national reconciliation in a framework that is in compliance with the laws of the country.\n\nIn a statement released by his office on 19 December 2014, Amir Hossein Jahanshahi announced that in conjunction with his decision for returning to Iran and conducting his activities in compliance with the laws of the country, the activities of Raha TV will cease at the end of 2014. Having said that three years before, Raha TV had been established as a fully independent and free Iranian media channel in the field of 'news and analysis', Jahanshahi expressed the hope that conclusion at this point will spark the start of a new beginning so that this television station may resume its activities at a time of economic development and prosperity and in compliance with the laws of Iran.\n"}

{"id": "49140015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49140015", "title": "Arif Ali (publisher)", "text": "Arif Ali (publisher)\n\nArif Ali (born 13 March 1935) is a Guyanese-born publisher and newspaper proprietor who migrated to London in 1957. The company he founded in 1970, Hansib, was among pioneering publishers in the UK that disseminated publications of relevance to Britain's black community, others being New Beacon Books (1966) and Bogle-L'Ouverture (1968). Hansib went on to become the largest black publisher in Europe.\n\nOne of seven children, Arif Ali was born in Danielstown, on the Essequibo coast, British Guiana (now Guyana); two of his grandparents were Indian indentured labourers, but by the time of his birth the family had become wealthy landowners. \n\nAfter graduating from high school in Georgetown, Ali left on 12 August 1957 for London, intending to study economics, and arrived at Victoria Station on 3 September, having travelled to Britain via the Canary Islands, Spain, Italy and France. He initially worked at different jobs, including on the buses and as a porter in a hospital — where in 1958 he met a young English nurse named Pamela who three months later became his wife.\n\nIn 1966 Ali started to run a greengrocer's in Tottenham Lane, an area with a significant Caribbean population in north London, and before long, as Carolyn Cooper notes, \"his business place became a vibrant cultural centre\". One of the few outlets for Caribbean provisions such as yams, plantains and cassava, the shop also sold newspapers brought in from such Caribbean countries as Guyana, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados: \"The newspapers served to connect West Indians in the diaspora with their respective home territories.\"\n\nAli progressed from this to producing on a Gestetner machine a cheaply priced compilation of articles called \"The Westindian\", a venture that proved successful. He sold the food shop and in 1970 founded Hansib Publications — named after his parents, Haniff and Nasibun (Sibby) — specifically to cater for this readership and in April 1971 the company published \"The Westindian Digest\", a magazine for Britain's West Indian communities. In 1973 Hansib published its first book, edited by Ali and entitled \"Westindians in Great Britain\". New editions of this \"Who's Who\" came out in subsequent years, and with the fifth edition in 1982, the name of the publication was changed to \"Third World Impact\".\n\nHis career as a newspaper publisher started in 1973 with the acquisition of \"West Indian World\" from its then owner Aubrey Baynes, who had launched the paper in mid-1971 but had become disillusioned with its financial viability. Under Ali's editorship the \"West Indian World\" prospered, campaigning on various educational issues that were affecting black schoolchildren. Ali went on to further engage and communicate with the Caribbean, African and Asian communities by establishing the \"Asian Digest\" (August 1980), the newspapers \"Caribbean Times\" (1981), \"Asian Times\" (1983) and \"African Times\" (1985), as well as \"Root\" magazine (1987). By the 1990s he had a staff of 140, publishing three weekly papers and two monthly magazines. The circulation of the \"Caribbean Times\" peaked at 28,000, with average sales of about 10,000 copies.\n\nIn 1997 Ali sold his newspapers in order to concentrate on book publishing, and Hansib remains \"the biggest and most diverse black book publisher in Britain\". Talking to \"The Guardian\", Ali said: \"In the 1960s, mainstream European-led publishing houses rarely published black and minority ethnic (BME) writers' work, if at all. Little positive was written about us, our cultures, our backgrounds and performances. I went into publishing to print stories and feelings that needed telling and would not be produced elsewhere.\" \n\nBy the time of its 40th anniversary in 2010, Hansib had brought out more than 200 titles, in categories encompassing politics, history, culture, sport, cookery, to multicultural literature including poetry, fiction and memoir, with claims to have for more than four decades \"reflected and chronicled the achievements and struggles, the turmoils and frustrations, and the hopes and dreams of Britain's Caribbean, African and Asian communities.\" Ali himself has edited some of the company's successful titles, such as the Nations Series, illustrated portraits of countries, such as \"Jamaica Absolutely\", \"Trinidad and Tobago: Terrific and Tranquil\" and \"Guyana at 50: Reflection, Celebration and Inspiration\".\n\nIn parallel with his publishing activities, Ali has been involved over the years with various black political organisations, and was public relations officer for the West Indian Standing Conference, an umbrella organisation comprising more than 40 UK-based African and Caribbean groups.\n\n\n"}

It was developed and published by Activision Value, and released on March 21, 2003 for Microsoft Windows on the PC.\n\n\"Atlantis Underwater Tycoon\" was the first building sim to be set underwater.\n\nIn \"Atlantis Underwater Tycoon\", the player can choose to play in missions or in a sandbox-environment map to start building their underwater colony. The player chooses a tycoon character to play as who comes with their own positive and negative traits, such as providing bonus starting money, or having a disreputable attitude towards sea life.\n\nThe player starts on the ocean floor with a home base and a set amount of money. The player then expands the underwater colony by constructing various residential, utility, commercial, industrial, tourist, and military buildings that extend outward from the home base in a design conducive to the ocean floor, linking them with air tubes, and terraforming the seabed if needed. The player is able to collect and store items produced by commercial and industrial buildings in warehouses and sell them off in a market. The player can also breed new wildlife to live in the city's waters, such as dolphins or sharks, as well as create underwater vehicles to roam around the city. As the city grows, a wider range of buildings and residents become available. Such buildings include whale sanctuaries, sea turtle aquariums, shopping malls, oil drills, and prison facilities. New and better buildings bring in more citizens and tourists, generating more income for the city. Over time, buildings nearing their life expectancies can be demolished to make room for new buildings. In the late stages of the game, the player can unlock the ability to build Atlantean structures.\n\nIn addition to having to manage the economic aspects of the game, the player must also contend with attacks from enemy pirates and from enemy Atlanteans, as well as deal with underwater natural disasters. Military vessels and friendly Atlantean defenders can be recruited to defend against such attacks. Military buildings, such as sonic cannons and missile turrets, can be manned by the player to shoot projectiles at hostile vessels and destructive debris to destroy them.\n\nOn the whole, the player prevents the city from falling into harm by keeping a watchful eye out for enemy invaders and natural disasters, while managing the city's businesses so that population happiness, tourism, and sea life can prosper, all the while avoiding the city plunging into financial trouble.\n\n\"Atlantis Underwater Tycoon\" has been praised for its well-done visuals and its snappy underwater music track. The ability to see into buildings and view the people within nightclubs and movie theaters is also a nice plus. The visual depiction of night and day from the rays of light shining down on the city also provides for a nice ambiance effect. The top moments in the game can be attributed to the times when a player's prospering city \"[comes] under attack from enemy subs, and the player reacts to mount a counter-attack to avoid all the player's hard work from being obliterated.\"\n\nOne reviewer says that the game's biggest weakness lay in its lack of variety in building models and resources.\n\n"}

Typically, enterprise planning systems are part of a firm's knowledge base or corporate structure whether it formally identified and structured or simply executed these when the need appeared.\n\nAn enterprise planning system will address at least three basic purposes to help the enterprise: \n\nAn enterprise will plan for tactical moves for quick reaction to the PESTLE threats that affect its survival. For instance, right after Japan's Fukushima nuclear power plant has experienced explosions due to the earthquake and the tsunami that followed, several enterprises (within and outside Japan) have publicly announced their course of actions to address the emergency.\n\nMeanwhile, an enterprise will plan for longer term strategic actions to address its competition or improve its competitiveness. For instance, enterprises will plan for, set budgets, implement and use strategic information systems as “information systems or information technology investments can be a source of competitive advantage”.\n\nMost significantly, an enterprise will plan for using the PESTLE opportunities that are available to it. The profit and benefit motives justify most enterprise planning systems.\n\nA fourth noteworthy purpose for enterprise planning systems is preparedness against terrorist attacks. As noted in the US Presidential Directive for Critical infrastructure protection, terrorist groups are likely to attack commercial infrastructure for economic sabotage. Enterprises that are providing products or services that are critical to the economic system of a nation are potential targets of extremists.\n\nTwo major characteristics of EPSs are (1) variety and (2) flexibility. For instance, technological risks abound as even enterprise software are prone to obsolescence and disruptive innovations. Technology is not stagnant. Thus, variety and flexibility work to the advantage of a strategically adaptive or agile enterprise as PESTLE conditions change.\n\nTo illustrate this some more, ERP software prescribes processes to realize its promised benefits. However, compliance to these rigid, prescribed processes is often assumed rather than real. In many cases, the ERP software is accepted but the practices within the enterprise reflect inconsistencies with the prescribed processes of the software. In a sense, variety and flexibility in a standard ERP implementation will still manifest in many ways such as \"workarounds, shadow systems, various forms of unintended improvisations, and organizational 'drift'\" as the knowledge workers in the enterprise adapt to the realities of daily activities.\n\nWith changing real world conditions, at least three components can structure enterprise strategy. These are: \n\nFrameworks of analysis usually drive a firm's strategy. These enable the firm to cope with the actions of its competitors, demands of its consumers or clients, nature of its operating environments, effects of government regulations in the places where it does business, or opportunities that are available among other factors. Here, team planning is crucial. One group will normally specialize in one aspect like operations or government regulations. Managing the interrelation of PESTLE factors requires teamwork in the enterprise planning process.\n\nA sample framework for general analysis is the SWOT analysis. Another is the Balanced Scorecard for performance measurement analysis.\n\nEnterprise strategy can also refer to the mix of structured actions that address the political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental factors that affect a business or firm. These structured actions can be local, transnational, global or combination of local, transnational or global. Hence, enterprises can have any of the following geographic strategies in their plans:\n\nMoreover, since management actions occur simultaneously in an enterprise, strategic planners can consider operations or project portfolio management (PPM) as crucial elements in an enterprise's strategic planning guide.\n\nFor instance, the need to have strategic priorities across many projects in companies with multiple product development projects have made executives borrow principles from investment portfolio management to better manage the distribution of resources compared with the assessed risks for each project.\n\nThus, PESTLE factors lead to strategy formation that will enable the enterprise to adapt to changing conditions. Meanwhile, the strategies that have been formed from the analytical framework processes of evaluating an enterprise's condition will lead to detailed plans which could be part of a firm's manual of operations or projects portfolio thrusts for funding and execution across the units or geographic coverage of the enterprise.\n\nEnterprise planning and budgeting go hand-in-hand as the wherewithal to execute plans will determine the success or failure of an enterprise strategy. In another light, expanding or limiting the budget for a particular operations aspect of the enterprise or an ongoing project in favor of another will signal changes to an enterprise's strategy. Hence, planning and budgeting are integral parts of any enterprise planning systems as these impact the strategic directions of the enterprise.\n\nFor instance, enterprise projects tend to be mutually dependent with other projects to leverage a firm's engineering, financial and technology resources. A market research project will trigger a research, development and engineering (RD&E) project for a new product. In turn, this RD&E project could trigger a production strategy project to manufacture the new product at the most efficient locations to bring it closer to its target consumers. Hence, cutting the RD&E project budget in half or increasing it twice will have profound effects in the long term direction of an enterprise as this will affect the other units of the firm undertaking projects that are linked to the RD&E project.\n\nEnterprise planning and budgeting can be generally classified into:\n\nCentralized. Headquarters or executive management directs all planning and budgets from the top then downwards in the organization hierarchy. It will closely follow Frederick Winslow Taylor's Principles of Scientific Management.\n\nDevolved. Middle managers set plans effectively steering the enterprise's strategic direction. Executive management takes into account that the enterprise has knowledge workers that are experts in their respective fields. The Management Board approves the proposed strategic direction under certain financial constraints such as expected returns on investment or equity.\n\nHybrid. Executive management determines and sets the strategic direction of the enterprise based on the inputs of middle managers and the rank and file. In this set up, plans and budgets are negotiated.\n\nEssentially, enterprise plans and budgets can be detailed in a top-down approach, generalized in a bottom-up approach, or combined in a top-down and bottom-up approach.\n\nEnterprise group planning will typically refer to the involvement of the major units of an enterprise such as the finance, marketing, production or technology departments. It can also refer to the involvement of the geographic units of a transnational or global firm. Some enterprises also involve external parties in their group planning where inputs from the crucial parts of the supply chain, cooperation and collaboration, or outsiders-looking-in are part of the firm's strategy.\n\nEnterprise group planning will usually manifest in regular board of directors' or management committee' meetings with varying frequencies such as monthly, quarterly or annually. Traditional meetings have required the physical presences of representatives from the various business units of the enterprise. With improvements in telecommunications, enterprise group planning can be conducted through video conferencing where participants may be dispersed geographically. However, video conferencing still appears to be an inadequate substitute when warm, interpersonal relations are part of the firm's culture.\n\nYet for fast-paced events like natural disasters or a meltdown of the financial markets that require immediate action from the enterprise, video conferencing might be the only option. Troubleshooting that requires the major resources of the enterprise will also entail enterprise group planning. Here, enterprise planning systems take a tactical form rather than a strategic focus to preserve the stability or ensure the survival of the enterprise.\n\nEnterprise transition plans will generally refer to change management-related actions in the case of mergers or in the implementation of an enterprise-wide project. The transition plan will cover the elimination of redundant functions in the case of a merger or the incorporation of new processes into business operations in the case of a technology project.\n\nEnterprise planning software will have varied or depth of coverage but will not essentially refer to enterprise resource planning software. This will include planning-centric software and the tools to support strategic and tactical planning for and across the enterprise, such as:\n\n"}

In the 14th Congress of the Philippine Senate, he became Senate Majority Leader, replacing Senator Francis Pangilinan on November 17, 2008. During his Majority Leadership, the Senate passed a record 650 bills. In the 17th Congress, he was once again elected as Senate Majority Leader on May 21, 2018, filling the vacancy left by elected Senate President Vicente Sotto III.\n\nHe is also the current vice chairman of the Philippine Red Cross.\n\nDuring his first term as senator, Zubiri announced his resignation from the Senate on August 3, 2011, following allegations of poll fraud during the Senate elections of 2007.\n\nZubiri was born in Makati City, Philippines to a Negrense father, Jose Maria Rubin Zubiri, Jr. from Kabankalan City and a Bicolana mother, Maria Victoria Ocampo Fernandez of Libon, Albay who was raised in the province of Bukidnon in Mindanao. He speaks Cebuano, Tagalog, English, and his father's native Hiligaynon. His father Jose Maria is the incumbent Bukidnon provincial governor.\n\nHis family is of partial (patrilineal) Basque and Spanish heritage.\n\n• Governor of the Philippine Red Cross <br>\n• Member, Rotary Club of Makati<br>\n• Governor, Ranchers' Club Philippines 1989– University of the Philippines Los Banos chapter <br>\n• Chairman, Amateur Boxing Association of the Philippines Bukidnon Chapter <br>\n• Chairman, Paglaum Foundation <br>\n• Member, Upsilon Phi Sigma Fraternity and Sorority <br>\n• President of the KATALA Foundation <br>\n• President of the Philippine Deer Foundation <br>\n\nZubiri finished elementary and high school in Colegio San Agustin-Makati. He graduated from the University of the Philippines Los Baños with a degree in Bachelor of Science in Agribusiness Management. He also earned a Master of Environment and Natural Resources Management degree from the University of the Philippines Open University.\n\nAfter serving as chief of staff of his father, Rep. (now Bukidnon Governor) Jose Ma. R. Zubiri, Jr., from 1995–1998, he ran for the seat representing the third district of Bukidnon to be vacated by his father in the 1998 general elections. Winning easily in that election, he served his first term in the 10th Congress. During his first term, he was one of the members of what the media dubbed as the \"Spice Boys\", a group of neophyte and two-term congressmen who were openly critical of President Joseph Estrada's administration. He was subsequently re-elected to the Philippine House of Representatives in the 2001 and 2004 elections.\n\nAfter serving as a Congressman for three-terms, he was drafted by Lakas CMD to be one of their candidates in the pro Gloria Macapagal Arroyo administration TEAM Unity ticket in the 2007 mid-term elections.\n\nIn the final tally for the 2007 senatorial race by the Philippine Commission on Elections (Comelec), Rep. Zubiri narrowly defeated opposition candidate Koko Pimentel for the 12th and last slot in the Senate. Zubiri had a total of 11,001,730 votes against Pimentel's 10,983,358 votes. The margin of some 18,372 votes was hotly contested, particularly the votes from the southern Philippine province of Maguindanao, where Pimentel had lost heavily to Zubiri.\n\nClaiming the votes in Maguindanao were tainted, Pimentel petitioned the Philippine Supreme Court to invalidate the votes from Maguindanao, effectively disenfranchising a whole province. The Supreme Court voted unanimously 14 -0 against Pimentel and allowed the COMELEC (Commission on Elections) to count the votes in Zubiri's favor. Pimentel then returned to the Supreme Court for the second time. This time, he petitioned the justices to issue a restraining order against the proclamation of Zubiri. After oral arguments, however, the High Tribunal again voted to uphold the COMELEC's decision to proclaim Zubiri, consequently failing to grant Pimentel's petition. The next day, July 14, 2007, Zubiri was duly proclaimed elected to the Philippine Senate. However, the Court's judgment did not prevent Pimentel from bringing his poll protests to the Senate Electoral Tribunal.\n\nOn March 14, 2008, the Supreme Court, in a 40-page decision penned by Associate Justice Minita Chico-Nazario, dismissed Koko Pimentel petition to stop the Commission on Elections from canvassing votes from the province of Maguindanao, a definite morale booster for Senator Zubiri.\n\nWhile serving his stint in the Senate, Zubiri began advocating a more in-depth study of biofuels in order to prevent food shortages, all the while allowing current production of alternative clean energy and biofuels so as to lessen dependence on imported oil and allow the Philippine economy a new avenue of economic success, \"especially in this day and age of constant rising oil prices\".\n\nOn August 3, 2011, however, during his privilege speech on the floor in the Philippine Senate, Zubiri suddenly announced his resignation from the body. In his speech, he said that his family was hurt by the \"unfounded\" accusations against him. \"Without admitting any fault and with my vehement denial of the alleged electoral fraud hurled against me, I am submitting my resignation as a duly elected Senator of the Republic of the Philippines in the election for which I am falsely accused without mercy and compassion,\" Zubiri said in his speech. \"My political detractors began calling me ugly names and dragging the name of my family in entirety. In other words, Mr. President, the trial by publicity has begun,\" he continued.\n\nHis resignation was lauded by Malacañang and various sectors but was also seen as a step that helped restore the Filipino's faith in national electoral protests. \n\nSenator Francis Pangilinan, a member of the Senate Electoral Tribunal, likewise refused to comment on what the next procedure is for the vacancy left by Zubiri. \"Let's just wait for developments if any,\" he said.\n\nIn 2016, he ran for the senate under the Partido ng Galing at Puso of Senator Grace Poe's presidential campaign placing 6th in the polls. As like other politicians, he left his party and joined PDP–Laban, mending his relations with Koko Pimentel, his former adversary.\n\n"}

The original Dallas Memorial Auditorium was designed by George Dahl in 1957. It holds approximately 10,000 seats. Dahl was responsible for the renowned Art Deco buildings at the Dallas Fair Park, as well as many other Texas landmarks. The Convention Center additions were designed by Larry Oltmanns, who was a Design Partner with Skidmore, Owings and Merrill at the time.\n\nThe center is over in size and contains over of exhibit space. The largest contiguous exhibit space in the structure is . A column-free exhibit hall in the center is the largest of its kind in the United States. It is annually used for the Dallas Auto Show.\n\nThe east side of the structure contains the original element of the Dallas Memorial Auditorium, a 9,816-seat arena. The complex also houses a 1,740-person theater, 105 meeting rooms, and 2 gigantic ballrooms. In terms of accessibility, the world's largest heliport/vertiport sits atop the structure and 75 truck berths line its docks. The Dallas CBD Vertiport, located at the south end of the complex, has two 60 x 60 ft. (18 x 18 m) concrete helipads and of flight deck, and is capable of handling tiltrotor aircraft such as the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey.\n\nIn May 2009, voters approved construction of the Omni Dallas Convention Center Hotel, a 1,000 room hotel that is attached to the Convention Center. It opened in late 2011, under budget and ahead of schedule.\n\nThe Dallas Memorial Auditorium was originally constructed in 1957 near the intersection of Canton and Akard Streets. While the auditorium still hosts many smaller events, its antiquated facilities and technology, along with the fact that it is not compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act, have kept it less busy than in the past. In the 1970s, the center was expanded and renamed the Dallas Convention Center; the expansion was designed by local architects Omniplan. The center was expanded again in 1984 and once more in 1994, when Dallas Area Rapid Transit constructed the Convention Center Station underneath the west-wing of the facility, connecting it to the and light rail lines. The most-recent addition to the facility was completed in 2002. The complex was renamed in honor of former US Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison in 2013.\n\nThe venue was once home of the Dallas Chaparrals/Texas Chaparrals of the American Basketball Association, who played in Dallas from the 1967-68 season through the 1972-73 season. The team moved to San Antonio in 1973 and became the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nOn August 22, 1973, The Jackson 5 held a concert in the auditorium. While on a five city tour in the final week of 1976, Elvis Presley performed at the Dallas Convention Center on December 28. The concert was recorded and later released on the Follow That Dream collectors label with the title of \"Showtime!\" On April 1, 1977, Led Zeppelin opened what would become their last ever American tour together in the Dallas Memorial Auditorium, their sixth time performing at the venue. In October 1978, Queen played at the Convention Center during their US tour, and the music video for \"Fat Bottomed Girls\" was filmed at the center. Prince had two concerts at the venue: once in 1981 and again in 2000. Other performers who held concerts here include: Madonna, James Brown, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, Grateful Dead, Black Sabbath, Bruce Springsteen, David Bowie, Billy Joel, and Elvis Costello.\n\nTogether with Reunion Arena, the center was an emergency shelter for thousands of Hurricane Katrina refugees in September 2005. \n\nBeginning in 2014, the center became the venue for Fan Expo Dallas.\n\nFrom March 31 to April 3, 2016, WWE hosted the professional wrestling convention WWE Axxess at the center.

He studied in The Hague, and took several trips to the United States and Sweden to study progress in automatization and wood manufacturing. In 1920 he became manager of the family's new door factory in Zaandam. In 1922 he married Titia Verkade, granddaughter of the industrialist Ericus Gerhardus Verkade.\n\nBruynzeel Jr. was an avid sailor. He won the Fastnet race for the Netherlands in 1937 with his Stephens-designed yawl \"Zeearend\" (\"sea eagle\", the eagle being the logo of the Bruynzeel company). The Dutch designer Piet Zwart worked closely with Bruynzeel's father and his brother Willem (he designed their first kitchens) and was involved with the design of the Zeearend as well.\n\nIn 1939, when the production had expanded to include floors and kitchens and the threat of World War II was causing a decline in the building industry, he considered alternatives and pioneered the development of new timber materials for the production of the Bruynzeel kitchen and for boat construction. Using a newly developed water-resistant synthetic resin glue, Bruynzeel developed a durable three-ply wood, similar to plywood, for the fabrication of external doors. Bruynzeel went on to extend the concept of the modular kitchen and with E.G. van de Stadt developed the first industrialised boat construction system in the world.\n\nToday Bruynzeel Multipanel Int. B.V., as it was later renamed, is a leading timber company that specialises in marine and construction timber, with distribution throughout Europe, North America and the Caribbean, amongst others. The Bruynzeel name also lives on as a shelving brand of the Norwegian Constructor Group.\n\nIn 1956 Kees Bruynzeel Jr. moved to South Africa, where he owned and operated a company Bruply Doors, including a factory at Stellenbosch. Bruynzeel's South African timber operations now comprise PG Bison and are controlled by Steinhoff Africa.\n\nIn 1962, Bruynzeel built a house in Stellenbosch, that was controversial considering the conservative architecture of the time. The roof of the house is shaped like a hyperbolic paraboloid, and is constructed using teak rafters and lined with yellowwood. It was designed by architect Aart Bijl.\n\nBruynzeel continued sailing and winning races.

The corporations Jetta has analyzed include Amazon, Family Dollar, Dollar Tree, Walmart, Apple, Kmart, JcPenney, and Sears. In addition, Jetta has also studied the organic food industry, the vitamin industry, and the online grocery industry. Other investigations led by Jetta include sociological research that pertains to the purchasing habits of various ethnic groups. In the area of trade promotion, Jetta has developed an alternative methodology to current industry baseline models. Jetta also analyzes rewards programs. He is a Republican candidate in Florida’s 21st Congressional District.\n\nBetween 1996 and 1998 he held a position as Chief Executive Officer of Binky-Griptight, Inc. Binky-Griptight is a supplier of infant products. Prior to Binky-Griptight, Jetta spent seven years at Playtex Products.\n\nIn 1998, Jetta founded TABS Group, where he is the Chief Executive Officer and Lead Product Developer. TABS Group provides marketing analysis for clients in the Consumer Products industry. Additionally, he serves as an independent Director for JM Global Holding, Co. Work by Jetta and TABS has been quoted in The New York Times, Forbes, Bloomberg, and other national media.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2012, Jetta sampled 1,000 individuals who were aged 18–75 in order to study \"their buying habits when it comes to organic products.\" Kurt Jetta's research, with regard to the organic food industry, suggests that the \"percentage of people who buy organic products has stayed virtually the same for the past few years,\" at the 38-39% range. The study found that \"Fresh Fruits continues to be the highest penetration category for Organics with 27% of consumers. This is followed by Fresh Vegetables (26%), Eggs (17%), Milk (16%), Chicken (13%), Skincare (7%), Red Meat (6%), Frozen Vegetables (6%), Haircare (5%), Frozen Fruit (4%), Ice Cream (4%), and Cosmetics (3%). Skincare and Haircare are the only two categories that registered consecutive years of annual gains, while Milk and Ice Cream showed declines in consecutive years.\" Jetta and his firm have also found that due to negative studies concerning multivitamins, the vitamin industry saw an \"overall lethargy\" in 2014.\n\nJetta has stated that \"The most important thing that data is used for is to determine which products consumers prefer, and to make sure what's on the shelf is what they want to buy...For example, we're doing one project for a retail chain where we found that in areas with high African-American populations, not only do they buy African-American hair care products and cosmetics specifically, but they buy grooming products in general at a very high level. With that kind of information, the retailer can make sure all those products are stocked and available for them.\"\n\nIn early 2016, Jetta criticized the consumer packaged goods industry for stalling their own growth. His work, covered by both Wells Fargo and Food Navigator USA, showed that the consumer packaged goods industry focuses too much on less effective promotional tactics such as retailer loyalty programs and marketing to millennials at the expense of doing more traditional consumer trade promotion. He has also published opinion articles on the topic.\n\nAlso in 2016, Jetta’s research on online purchasing of baby goods by consumers received press when the study revealed that baby products are the largest online market of any of the consumer packaged goods categories studied.\n\nJetta began commenting on the online grocery business in 2016. After a TABS study found that fewer consumers purchased groceries online in 2016 than in 2015, he reported that “online grocery is failing,” and that Amazon would have difficulty breaking into grocery business because consumers enjoy grocery shopping in brick and mortar stores. He also commented on the pricing strategies of Whole Foods, stating that grocery shoppers wanted “deals.” When Amazon announced its intent to purchase Whole Foods in June 2017, Jetta’s research and commentary was quoted in Bloomberg and The Denver Post, and he was interviewed on NPR.\n\nIn July 2014, after Dollar Tree announced its acquisition bid of Family Dollar, \"USA Today\" shared Kurt Jetta's prediction that the merger would affect the entire economic sector shared by companies such as Walmart. Jetta's TABS Group formed a \"senior-level team dedicated to supporting internal and customer-related initiatives with Walmart\" and researched the methodology that enables this corporation to operate \"on a chain and local level.\" Tying in with his consumer research related to the organic food industry, Jetta et al. found that Walmart suffered in some areas after it \"jumped on the organic bandwagon a little too soon\".\n\nHe also reviewed Walmart’s change in practice of charging almost all their vendors a stocking fee. Formally the corporation charged these fees sporadically. While a common practice among other retailers, Jetta notes that the change for Walmart, \" suggests that they are seeking areas to offset their increased investment in wages, as well as offset their lack of organic revenue growth.\"\n\nAdditionally, he weighed in on the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by retailer chain A&P. He said that the retailer “…has been a dead man walking for 20 years, and the gig is finally up.” Jetta predicts that while one of A&P’s largest creditors might take over some of the stores, many will close and better-managed competitors will purchase the rest.\n\nWhen Ahold NV and Delhaise Group merged to become one of the largest supper market chains in the United States, Jetta noted his approval of the $560 million in savings the companies will incur after just 3 years, was “vital in a flat market.”\n\nJetta also shared his insights about Apple Stores' EasyPay innovation in Macworld, after a court case was pending about Eric Shine who \"was accused of trying to walk out of the Apple Store on New York’s Fifth Avenue without paying for a pair of headphones\" although Shine claims that \"he did try to pay, using the mobile Apple Store app’s EasyPay option on his phone, but that the purchase didn’t go through.\" Jetta stated that 'when stores add customer-driven point of sale (POS) options like EasyPay, “in general, what happens is that there’s a fairly significant surge in sales” at first, due to the novelty of the new system. That’s then followed by some “shakeout of people that don’t like it for a lot of reasons—user difficulty, user error, and the like.”'\n\nKurt Jetta's research pertaining to Kmart and Sears found that both of their rewards programs gave discounts of one percent, which Jetta stated, has the effect of hurting their whole customer base. Jetta has also criticized JcPenney for what he perceives to be a lack of understanding of trade promotion methodology.\n\nWhen grocery chain A&P filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2015, Jetta criticized the chain, calling the bankruptcy “a surprise to absolutely no one.”\nIn 2015, Jetta estimated the US supplements industry at $11.8 billion, challenging Nutrition Business Journal’s estimate of over $35 billion as “vastly overstated.” His statements prompted a rebuttal from Nutrition Business Journal’s Editor-in-Chief and started an ongoing debate.\n\nJetta received his B.S. in Statistics in 1983 from North Carolina State University, where he served as Interfraternity Council President. In 1986, he earned his M.B.A. from The Fuqua School of Business at Duke University.\n\nNineteen years later, Jetta pursued his Ph.D. In Economics from Fordham University, where he graduated in 2008. His doctoral thesis was titled: A Theory of Retailer Price Promotion Using Economic Foundations: It’s All Incremental, with his central thesis being that the incremental sales generated on a promoted product is entirely incremental to the brand, category and promoting retailer. He published findings from his dissertation in the Journal of Centrum Cathedra and Journal of Research in Marketing.\n\nJetta served several years on the Stamford Board of Representatives from 1987-1993. He ran an unsuccessful for the Connecticut House of Representatives in 1988. In October 2017, Jetta declared himself as a Republican candidate for the U.S. House of Representative in Florida’s 21st Congressional District. One of his issues is increased federal focus on the opioid abuse.\n\nJetta has been married since 1989 to Nancy Jetta from Stamford, CT. He has three adult children.\n\n"}

According to the European Commission's Directorate-General of Translation, the language industry comprises the activities of translation, interpreting, subtitling and dubbing, software and website globalisation, language technology tools development, international conference organisation, language teaching and linguistic consultancy. According to the Canadian Language Industry Association, this sector comprises translation (with interpreting, subtitling and localisation), language training and language technologies. The European Language Industry Association limits the sector to translation, localisation, internationalisation and globalisation. An older, perhaps outdated view confines the language industry to computerised language processing and places it within the information technology industry. An emerging view expands this sector to include editing for authors who write in a second language—especially English—for international communication. \n\nThe scope of services in the industry includes:\n\nThe persons who facilitate multilingual communication by offering individualized services—translation, interpreting, editing or language teaching—are called language professionals.\n\nTranslation as an activity exists at least since mankind started developing trade millennia ago; so, if we include interpreting, it is no exaggeration to say that the origins of language industry are older than those of written language.\n\nModern language industry has developed rapidly following availability of the internet. Achievements of the industry include the ability to quickly translate long texts into many languages. This has created new challenges as compared with the traditional activity of translators, such as that of quality assurance. There are various quality standards such as the International Organization for Standardization's ISO 17100, EN 15038 in Europe, the CAN CGSB 131.10 in Canada and ASTM F2575-06 in the USA.\n\nA study commissioned by the EC's Directorate-General for Translation estimated the language industry in European member states to be worth 8.4 billion euro in 2008. The largest portion, 5.7 billion euro, was ascribed to the activities of translation, interpreting, software localisation and website globalisation. Editing was not taken into consideration. The study projected an annual growth rate of 10% for the language industry. At the time the study was published, in 2009, the language industry was less affected by the economic crisis than other industry sectors. \n\nOne field of research in the industry includes the possibility of machine translation fully replacing human translation.\n\nRates for translation services have become a big discussion topic nowadays, as several translation outsourcers allegedly go in search of cheap labor. Professional associations like IAPTI try to put a stop to this development. Currency fluctuation is yet another important factor.\n\nApart from this, phenomena such as crowdsourcing appear in large-scale translations. \n\nUS President Barack Obama drew criticism after a 2009 White House white paper proposed incentives for automatic translation.\n\n"}

He currently serves as a president for the Crvena zvezda.\n\nČović was born in Belgrade, PR Serbia, FPR Yugoslavia, and graduated from the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Mechanical Engineering. In 2000, he obtained his Ph.D at the same university.\n\nIn 1992, as a member of the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), 34-year-old Čović started his climb up the political ladder with a position of executive board vice-president in charge of economy and finances at the Belgrade city assembly.\n\nA year later, in 1993, he advanced to the position of the city government president. In 1994 he got elected as the Mayor of Belgrade. In parallel, Čović was the SPS deputy (MP) in the Serbian National Assembly. Čović was sacked from the mayoral post in mid January 1997 by the Serbian president and SPS party leader Slobodan Milošević amid the months-long protests in Serbia over the November 1996 municipal elections fraud. He was expelled from SPS on the same occasion.\n\nHe became the president of Democratic Alternative (DA) after the party got formed by certain number of SPS members seceded from SPS in July 1997.\n\nČović served as the head of the Coordination Center for Kosovo and Metohija and as the head of the Southern Serbia Coordination Center during Preševo Valley conflict (1999–2001).\n\nFrom 24 October 2000 to 25 January 2001 he was a member of the trio Co-Prime Ministers together with Milomir Minić from SPS and Spasoje Krunić from the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) that transitionally governed Serbia after the Bulldozer Revolution, when Mirko Marjanović was sacked. After the assassination of Zoran Đinđić, he was the acting Prime Minister of Serbia from 12 to 16 March 2003.\n\nIn 2004, his party Democratic Alternative merged into the Social Democratic Party (SDP). In 2005, he became president of the Social Democratic Party. The party ceased to exist in 2010.\n\nHe has been charged for corruption in January 2016.\n\n\nIn 1991 Čović became involved with Serbian basketball club KK ILR Železnik, a dormant sports collective for the workers of state-owned Ivo Lola Ribar metallurgical factory. Inactive since 1986, the club got revived by Čović under the auspices of his privately-owned metal products factory Fabrika metalnih proizvoda AD and renamed FMP Železnik. Under his guidance and ownership, the club grew into one of the top teams in Serbia and FR Yugoslavia, developing a reputation for player development and quality work with younger categories.\n\nBy 1993, the club got its own basketball facility — the 2,000-seat Železnik Hall that served as its home arena form then on. Climbing rapidly up the basketball pyramid in FR Yugoslavia, FMP began the 1994-95 season in the Second Federal League, winning promotion to the country's top basketball competition for the following 1995-96 season. \n\nIn 1998, Čović brought former Yugoslav national team player Ratko Radovanović on board as the club's sporting director. Radovanović soon became synonymous with the emerging club, making player personnel decisions and running its day-to-day operations. \n\nČović's son Filip later played as point guard for the club.\n\n\nIn late 1995, while simultaneously performing the city of Belgrade mayoral job as well as Serbian National Assembly MP duties, Čović became president of the Yugoslav Basketball Federation (KSJ), succeeding Veselin \"Vesko\" Barović in the job. In addition to Čović's political connections through SPS, the rapid success of his club FMP Železnik that was about to start competing in the country's top league that season after multiple promotions was the best possible recommendation for the job. \n\nAt the time when Čović came on board to lead the federation, FR Yugoslavia national team led by Duda Ivković were the reigning European champions, having returned to international competition following a four-year exile due to the UN embargo. Ivković soon stepped down and his assistant Željko Obradović took over the national team head coaching job. The national team had a great run at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, reaching the final against the American Dream Team composed of NBA players. In early 1997, soon after Čović's fall from grace in SPS, he was removed from the KSJ job as well.\n\n"}

He was raised in American Fork, Utah until the age of 13 when his father went to Grant's Pass, Oregon to take part in the building of a new sugar beet-processing factory for the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company. As Eli helped build the factory, he sent letters and money home, finally persuading his family to join him.\n\nThe family did not stay in Oregon long. Utah-Idaho failed to persuade local farmers to pick up the new crop and, two summers later, Eli was put in charge of dismantling the factory and loading it upon rail cars for reassembly in Yakima Valley, Washington. The family, which had always been poor, grew more impoverished with each move, and the Yakima venture did not pull them out.\n\nThe factory was not reassembled in time for the first year's (bumper) crop, and before the second year's crop could be processed, World War I ended, dropping sugar prices to what Bailey would later describe as \"catastrophic lows\". The lowered prices were accompanied by a disease called \"curly top\" which reduced the previously enormous Washington yields to industry-killing scarcity.\n\nThe Bailey family responded to the death of sugar with a disastrous attempt at potato farming in Washington, after which young Bailey ran away, back home to American Fork, where he set up residence with his maternal grandfather Joseph Barlow Forbes and his first wife—Bailey's grandmother—Nancy. Living with them meant Bailey was not allowed to drop out of school and work as he had intended.\n\nA year after his return to American Fork, his mother and his siblings also returned. Elie moved to Idaho Falls, Idaho to be foreman at a UISC factory there. Although Eli sent checks to his family, Bailey finally did drop out of school to help support his mother, who would soon divorce Eli, at which point Bailey left home for good with a move to Salt Lake City.\n\nSupporting himself with odd jobs, Bailey put himself through Henager's Business College and LDS Business College. While working at the county hospital as a night orderly, Bailey met Evelyn Robison. Shortly after impulsively kissing her and getting slapped in return, he moved to California and she returned to her hometown due to illness.\n\nShortly after arriving in Los Angeles, Bailey began work as an apprentice typographer. While working in newspapers, he remet Robison, who was working again at becoming a registered nurse. They were soon married, which resulted in her expulsion from General Hospital's School of Nursing. It was the eve of the Great Depression.\n\nEvelyn undertook secretarial training at Metropolitan College. Bailey's typographic work kept him busy and well employed throughout the Depression. However, he had developed a desire to write. He fed that need initially with fact-based, usually historical articles, including a serialized study of Samuel Brannan, published in the LDS periodicals \"Era\" and \"Millennial Star\", and, later, with much success, in book form. This began a string of successes with Church-owned publications, such as his novel \"For This My Glory\"; about the Mormon Battalion. His books were popular in Utah and even used as Sunday School texts.\n\nMeanwhile, he had taken reporting jobs at the \"Los Angeles Record\" and \"Hollywood Citizen\", followed by a sudden opportunity to purchase the \"Eagle Rock Advertiser\", one of two newspapers in Eagle Rock, a small town outside of Los Angeles. The paper was on the verge of collapse, but since he had both editorial and typographical preparation, Bailey was able to keep costs down and eventually turn the \"Advertiser\" into Eagle Rock's premier paper. Evelyn, for her part, drummed up additional advertising revenue.\n\nWorld War II brought on serious paper-rationing with smaller newspapers were powerless to work around. While larger LA-area papers were able to purchase Canadian pulp mills to keep in paper, smaller papers were forced to print fewer pages less frequently. The Baileys were particularly frustrated because during those boom years, the advertising available was much more than they had paper to print upon.\n\nTo supplement income, Bailey took a job reorganizing and running the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation's \"Lockheed Star\", printing five separate editions for the five separate factories in the Burbank area.\n\nAlso during the war years, Bailey started Westernlore Press to reprint classic texts on the Western United States, whose rarity prevented most interested libraries from purchasing copies. To his surprise, this venture was eased by the War Production Board's far less stringent requirements for acquiring book paper. The books published by Westernlore—on the same presses used by the \"Advertiser\"—were immediate successes and every edition sold out.\n\nDuring this time, Bailey also found time to write three new books. The first, a fictionalized version of his Samuel Brannan biography, and the second (also a novel) were \"enthusiastically received by the Saints.\" The third, \"Jacob Hamblin, Buckskin Apostle\", became a source of controversy. Bailey received angry responses from LDS leadership and the Hamblin family—in large part because his book dealt with Hamblin's marriages to two Indian women and two white women, and the Mountain Meadows massacre. In later years however, \"Buckskin Apostle\" would experience a renaissance in LDS circles—even being published by Church-owned publication.\n\nThe end of the war saw larger corporations buying up impoverished smaller papers and forcing the others out of business. The \"Advertiser\" was one of the few, hardy small papers that survived the war rationing, only to be forced out of business by larger corporation shortly thereafter.\n\nBailey ran Westernlore until 1973, when its inventory was lost in a fire and his son Lynn moved the company to Tucson, Arizona. During the years he ran it, Westernlore continued to publish books focused on the Western United States that were highly regarded by libraries and well purchased. Westernlore published some of Bailey's own work, but his better known books were published by larger companies.\n\nMany of his later books proved, to his and his publishers' surprise, to be controversial. For instance, \"For Time and All Eternity\"—a book about the anti-polygamy crusade in the 1890s—caused a small uproar among the Utah faithful (although, according to Samuel W. Taylor, \"Bailey . . . [said the uproar] resulted from the objections of one man to a single passage in the book\"), as did his book on Zion's Camp, the Missouri Contingent, the Nauvoo Legion and the Mormon Battalion— \"The Armies of God.\" Bailey believed the book was \"a warm, honest appraisal of Mormon heroism in conquering the West\" and his publisher had arranged for numerous interviews and signings in Utah; however, in the end the book was never so much as reviewed in the State.\n\nAlthough estranged in many ways from Mormonism, Bailey always embraced that part of his heritage.\n\nEvelyn died in 1981. Bailey never remarried; he died in 1987. They were buried in Fillmore, Utah.\n\nMany of his papers are held by the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\n\n"}

His company started to prosper, and he eventually became known to a wider public with the completion, in 1979, of Vienna's first mosque, situated on the banks of the river Danube.\n\nIn 1990 he opened his own shopping mall, \"Lugner City\", in a working class district of Vienna and, from the start, aggressively advertised his business by regularly inviting celebrities—starting with Thomas Gottschalk—who would perform there and sign autographs—a marketing strategy not very common in a city that, back then, hardly had any shopping malls. Through his shopping mall, Lugner was one of a small group of businesspeople who helped change Austrians' shopping habits by pushing to the limits the various regulations concerning opening hours. In a city where shops generally closed at 6 p.m. Mondays to Fridays and at noon on Saturdays to remain closed for more than one and a half days until Monday morning, Lugner strongly advocated late night shopping on at least one weekday and an extension of shopping hours to Saturday afternoon, even when that meant raising the trades unions' opposition.\n\nIn 1992 Mörtel and Mausi Lugner brought Harry Belafonte to Lugner City, and also took him along to the Vienna Opera Ball. From that time on, the couple have each year paid a celebrity to visit the shopping centre and then accompany them as their guest to that prestigious function at the Vienna State Opera, an \"invitation\" which has often been criticised or just belittled for being a nouveau riche idea. However, media attention has continually been rising, also abroad, so that today any official guests of honour are usually neglected compared to the Lugners' celebrities, who invariably have a status image:\n\nIn the late 1990s Richard Lugner handed over his business to his two grown-up sons by an earlier marriage, Alexander and Andreas Lugner, and went into politics. In the 1998 presidential elections he finished fourth in a field of five candidates, receiving 9.91 per cent of the popular vote; incumbent Federal President Thomas Klestil, who had been running for a second term of office, received 63.4%. For the parliamentary elections that took place the following year, the Lugners organised a separate platform called \"Die Unabhängigen\" (\"The Independents\") but, as they only received 1.02 per cent of the vote, did not get any seats in the \"Nationalrat\". Nevertheless, at the end of the millennium, a survey found that more than 90 per cent of Austrians recognized the name \"Lugner\". For the 2016 presidential election he announced to collect the necessary signatures in order to participate.\n\nIn September 2014, Lugner (aged 81) married German Playboy model Cathy Schmitz (aged 24) at a ceremony held at the Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna. Schmitz was a Playboy Bunny at the Playboy Club in Cologne before being the cover model of German Playboy in 2013. Lugner had been married four times before.\n\nLugner has four children: His two sons, Alexander and Andreas Lugner, are from his first marriage. He has another child Nadine from a marriage to actress Sonja Jeannine. His youngest child, daughter Jacqueline (aged 21 in 2014), is from his 4th marriage.\n\n\n"}

He is an heir to the Estée Lauder Companies, and the president of the World Jewish Congress.\n\nLauder was born in New York City, the son of Estée Lauder and Joseph Lauder, founders of Estée Lauder Companies. He is the younger brother of Leonard Lauder, chairman of the board of the Estée Lauder Companies. The boys were raised Jewish.\n\nHe attended the Bronx High School of Science and holds a bachelor's degree in International Business from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He studied at the University of Paris, and received a Certificate in International Business from the University of Brussels.\n\nLauder started to work for the Estée Lauder Company in 1964. In 1984, he became a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for European and NATO policy at the United States Department of Defense.\n\nIn 1986, Ronald Reagan named him as the United States Ambassador to Austria, a position he held until 1987. As ambassador, he fired diplomatic officer Felix Bloch, who later became known in connection with the Robert Hanssen espionage case.\n\nAs a Republican, he made a bid to become the mayor of New York City in 1989, losing to Rudy Giuliani in the Republican primary. Michael Massing, writing of this nomination race, notes that politically Lauder 'seemed out of step with most American Jews; ... he ran to the right of Rudolph Giuliani. And, on Israeli issues, he was a vocal supporter of the Likud party, with long-standing ties to Benjamin Netanyahu.\"\n\nIn 1998, Lauder was asked by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to begin Track II negotiations with Syrian leader Hafez al-Assad; these negotiations continued after the election of Ehud Barak to the post. Lauder communicated a new-found willingness on Assad's part to make compromises with the Israelis in an overall land for peace deal, and his draft \"Treaty of Peace Between Israel and Syria\" formed an important part of the (ultimately fruitless) Israeli-Syrian negotiations that occurred in January 2000 in Shepherdstown, West Virginia.\n\nLauder manages investments in real estate and media, including Central European Media Enterprises and Israeli TV. In 2010, Lauder founded RWL Water, LLC.\n\nLauder is actively involved in numerous civic organizations, including the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, the Jewish National Fund, the World Jewish Congress, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, the Anti-Defamation League, the Jewish Theological Seminary, Brandeis University, and the Abraham Fund. With his brother he founded the Lauder Institute at Wharton School. Lauder has also served as a finance chairman of the New York Republican State Committee.\n\nIn 2003, Lauder founded and became a president of Lauder Business School in Vienna, Austria.\n\nLauder led a movement to introduce term limits in the New York City Council, which were subsequently imposed on most NYC elected officials, including the Mayor and City Council, after a citywide referendum in 1993. In 1996, voters turned down a council proposal to extend term limits. Lauder spent $4 million on the two referendums. He has been involved in environmental conservation efforts in eastern Long Island and has served on the board of directors of the conservation organization Group for the East End since 2002.\n\nOn November 16, 2001, Lauder opened the Neue Galerie in New York, an art museum across the street from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Neue Galerie is dedicated to art from Germany and Austria from the early 20th century. It holds one of the best collections of works by Egon Schiele in the world.\n\nOn June 18, 2006, he purchased from Maria Altmann and her family, the painting \"Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I\" by Gustav Klimt for $135 million, the highest price ever paid for a painting at that time. Lauder called the painting \"Our Mona Lisa\". He reportedly saw Klimt's portrait as a youth in Vienna and had admired it since. The painting, a Nazi-looted art piece which had just been restored to Altmann following years of negotiation and litigation with the Austrian government, now forms the centerpiece of the museum's collection.\n\nLauder also has the world's largest private collection of medieval and Renaissance armor.\n\nLauder has been instrumental in a number of cases in recovering \"lost\" art from the Nazi period. He has been criticized for failure to resolve a case involving the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), which in 1997 exhibited some paintings owned by Rudolph Leopold, a Viennese doctor and art collector. An investigative article in \"The New York Times\" on December 24, 1997 – \"A Singular Passion for Amassing Art, One Way or Another\" – outlined a case involving \"Portrait of Wally\" by Egon Schiele, which was in the MoMA exhibition but was obtained by Leopold soon after the Nazi era. The New York County District Attorney (Manhattan) stepped in to help restore the piece to descendants of its original owner, but ownership of the painting is still in contention, nearly ten years later. Lauder has been accused of a failure to act on the case, despite being MoMA chairman at the time.\n\nLauder is an honorary trustee of the World Monuments Fund, a New York-based non-profit with the mission of protecting endangered cultural heritage sites around the world.\n\nIn 1987, Lauder established the Ronald S. Lauder Foundation, a philanthropic organization that is dedicated to rebuilding Jewish life in Central and Eastern Europe. The foundation also supports student exchange programs between New York and various capitals in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nIn 1998, Lauder co-founded the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation with his brother, Leonard A. Lauder. Its mission it to \"rapidly accelerate the discovery of drugs to prevent, treat and cure Alzheimer's disease.\" Ronald continues as the Foundation's co-chairman.\n\nLauder was elected president of the World Jewish Congress on June 10, 2007, following the resignation of Edgar Bronfman, Sr.. He beat the South African businessman Mendel Kaplan and Einat Wilf of Israel by a clear margin. As head of the international Jewish umbrella organization, he has met with a number of heads of state and government, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Pope Benedict XVI, Italian President Giorgio Napolitano, Austrian Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer, Czech President Václav Klaus, Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, King Abdullah of Jordan, Swiss President Pascal Couchepin, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto.\n\nPresident George W. Bush appointed him to serve on the honorary delegation to accompany him to Jerusalem for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the State of Israel in May 2008.\n\nLauder condemned the persecution of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. He said in a statement that \"The World Jewish Congress is extremely concerned by the plight of the Rohingya minority in Myanmar, who has suffered widespread persecution for years under the ruling military government and has been forced to flee in the hundreds of thousands in the past two weeks alone.\"\n\nIn July 2009, Bernie Ecclestone faced calls from Lauder to resign as Formula One chief after he had praised Adolf Hitler in a newspaper interview and said that Hitler \"got things done\". Lauder said someone with Ecclestone's views should not be allowed to run such an important and popular racing series. He urged Formula One teams, drivers and host countries to suspend their cooperation with him. In reaction, Ecclestone told the news agency Associated Press that \"I think the people who are saying that haven't got the power to say these things.\" Asked if the World Jewish Congress was influential, Ecclestone said: \"It's a pity they didn't sort the banks out\" and \"They have a lot of influence everywhere\". After a public outcry, Ecclestone apologized for his remarks and said he had \"been an idiot\".\n\nIn December 2009, Lauder protested against the Roman Curia's decree recognizing the heroic virtues of Pope Pius XII, asserting that an eventual beatification would be inopportune until the Holy See's historical archives from the 1939–1945 period were opened.\n\nIn 2011, writing in the German newspaper \"Die Welt\", Lauder called for Israel to be admitted into the Western defense alliance NATO: \"Israel needs real guarantees for its security. European NATO member states – including Turkey – must admit the state of Israel into the Western alliance,\" the WJC president wrote. He referred to the uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia and said they were reminders of how \"unpredictable\" developments in the Middle East were. Israeli NATO membership \"would send a strong signal to other countries not to take on Israel\", Lauder argued.\nLauder has also been outspoken on anti-Semitism. In an opinion article entitled \"Sweden's Shame\", he attacked the Swedish government, church officials and media for \"fanning the flames\" of hatred against Jews.\n\nIn May 2012, Lauder condemned as \"despicable\" remarks made by the Norwegian sociologist Johan Galtung who had \"revived anti-Semitic canards such as Jewish control of the media\" and suggested that Israel's Mossad could have been behind the 2011 \"massacres in Norway committed by Anders Breivik\" in which 77 people died. Lauder declared: \"There is a growing tendency to blame the Jews for all evil that happens under the sun. It is a scandal that a leading academics such as Galtung does not shy away from citing notorious forgeries such as the Protocols of the Elders of Zion to support his bigoted arguments.\"\n\nIn August 2012, Lauder criticized Austrian politicians for failing to publicly denounce the leader of the third-largest political party in the country, the FPÖ, Heinz-Christian Strache, who had posted an anti-Semitic cartoon on his Facebook page. \"Clearly, and not for the first time, the FPÖ leader is trying to whip up anti-Semitic sentiment. His repeated denials are not credible because his words and actions speak for themselves,\" Ronald Lauder said in a statement, adding: \"This scandal shows that anti-Jewish resentment is still widespread, and unscrupulous politicians are allowed to exploit it for electioneering purposes. That is mind-boggling, and it could have negative repercussions for Austrian Jews.\"\n\nLauder has been strongly critical of business deals by European energy firms with Iran and called for stronger UN sanctions because of Tehran's threat against Israel and its nuclear program. In April 2008, he criticized a visit by Swiss Foreign Minister Micheline Calmy-Rey to Tehran where she met with Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to help a Swiss company secure a multibillion-dollar contract to buy natural gas from Iran. Lauder told a press conference in Bern: \"Maybe that money that Switzerland is paying to Iran will some day be used to either buy weapons to kill Israelis, or buy weapons to kill Americans, or buy missiles to be able to deliver nuclear weapons.\" Lauder also led diplomatic efforts to persuade European businesses to withdraw from Iran. In January 2010, he warmly welcomed the announcement by Siemens CEO Peter Löscher that his company would not seek new business in Iran.\n\nIn February 2018, the Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki stated that \"there were Jewish perpetrators\" of the Holocaust, \"not only German perpetrators.\" Lauder condemned Morawiecki's comment as anti-Semitic, saying: \"The Polish prime minister [Morawiecki] has displayed appalling ignorance with his unconscionable claim that so-called 'Jewish perpetrators' were partly responsible for the Nazi German attempt to wipe out European Jewry...this government is going to extreme and unfathomable lengths to exonerate some of their countrymen's own complicity in the murders of their neighbors. This is nothing short of an attempt to falsify history, that is one of the very worst forms of anti-Semitism and Holocaust obfuscation. We demand an immediate retraction and apology from the Polish government of these absurd and offensive remarks.\".\n\nOn 19 April 2018, Ronald Lauder together with international guests took part in official 75th anniversary of the outbreak of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in Poland. Lauder made a long speech near the front of the Monument to the Ghetto Heroes in Warsaw and said:\n\nWe are standing here in a modern day Masada. Here in this former Warsaw Ghetto area the current ground is about 120 cm above prewar ground, above the rubble, bones and bodies of the heroes. This is holy ground. Every one here today should use these brave young Warsaw Ghetto fighters as an inspiration we will face all challenges ahead. We should learn strength and courage. I know I do. We also know that the death camps were designed, maintained and staffed by German SS troops. Jews, Christians and others were murdered there. Throughout Europe and in Poland there were also brave non-Jews <nowiki>[</nowiki>Righteous Among the Nations<nowiki>]</nowiki> who risked their lives and saved Jewish lives and were also people who betrayed Jews and sold their property. There was another chapter of great heroism written in Warsaw, here that we must also remember. Just one year after the small band of Polish Jews rose up against the Germans <nowiki>[</nowiki>Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943<nowiki>]</nowiki>, the entire Polish underground fought the German Nazis in one of the most brutal battle of the world <nowiki>[</nowiki>Non-Jewish but Polish Warsaw Uprising in 1944<nowiki>]</nowiki> and we must honor these great fighters as well in 1944. May God bless the memory of the valiant Polish Jews who fought and died here in the Warsaw Ghetto. May God bless the memory of the valiant Polish Catholics who fought and died here. May God bless all the Jewish people worldwide and all the Polish people. We will fight together against any oppressor who want to destroy our world. God bless Poland!\n\nIn 2018, OpenSecrets reported that Lauder had donated $1.1 Million to Secure America Now. The organization committed to educating the American public on the dangers posed to America by the development of nuclear weapons by Iran and radical Islam.\n\nLauder has repeatedly come to the defense of Israel in public and is seen as an ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In May 2012, he reacted \"with dismay\" at a suggestion by Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Eamon Gilmore to impose a European Union-wide import ban on products made in Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which Gilmore said were \"illegal\" and made peace between Israel and the Palestinians \"impossible\". Lauder said: \"Such boycott calls are cynical and hypocritical. Minister Gilmore is taking aim at the only liberal democracy in the Middle East while keeping quiet about those who really wreak havoc in the region: the Assads, Ahmadinejads and their allies Hezbollah and Hamas.\" He added that \"the West Bank territories are legally disputed and not illegally occupied.\"\n\nIn remarks to the International Council of Jewish Parliamentarians made on June 28, 2011, Lauder reportedly scolded Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for a number of missteps, including lacking a diplomatic plan heading into the September UN vote on Palestinian statehood and setting preconditions for negotiations as part of the Israeli–Palestinian peace process, according to \"Haaretz\". However, in June 2012, on the third anniversary of Israeli Prime Minister , Lauder published a full-page advertisement in \"The Wall Street Journal\" and other newspapers in which he called on Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to return to the negotiating table. \"Accept the offer to talk, President Abbas. It takes two sides to make peace,\" Lauder wrote.\n\nLauder has participated in a number of large media deals in Israel, among which was his purchase of part of commercial television Channel 10.\n\nIn September 2011, Israeli media published accounts that Lauder had put heavy pressure on the executives of the channel to broadcast a personal apology to the businessman Sheldon Adelson with regards to a profile that the channel had broadcast in January 2011. The apology read, \"After the broadcast of the piece, we checked the accusations. Our checks revealed that the accusations were – and are – completely false... We are very regretful that we did not check these accusations before broadcasting them.\" Lauder's forcing of the form of the apology led to the resignation of the channel's news chief Reudor Benziman, its news editor Ruti Yuval, and its presenter Guy Zohar (who continues in another post in Channel 10), who criticized Lauder for the pressure he exerted. Because of the attacks, detailed above, on Lauder (who had been until then the last major funder of the channel), he decided to reconsider his financial support. If the channel lost his funding, it would have difficulty continuing to operate to its current standard past October 2011.\n\nOn November 3, 2011, The Second Authority for Television and Radio reached a decision on the issue in which it decided that the apology to Adelson broadcast by the channel was appropriate and that \"no evidence has been presented that there was any intervention by the shareholders of Channel 10 on new content, or even on the text of the apology, which was agreed between the news company and the person injured by the broadcast\".\n\nThe Israelitische Kultusgemeinde Wien (Vienna Israelite Community) banned Lauder for allegedly interfering in its board elections. IKG President Oskar Deutsch alleged that Lauder had offered incentives to members of the IKG to support another candidate. A Lauder spokesman denied the allegations. In January 2013, it was reported that Deutsch and Lauder had resolved their dispute.\n\nA 2007 profile of Lauder in \"The New Yorker\" magazine detailed his residences, including three properties in Manhattan – a townhouse on East 70th Street, a townhouse (designed by Philip Johnson) on East 52nd Street, as well as an apartment at 740 Park Avenue. The profile additionally listed homes in Florida, London, Paris, and Wainscott, Long Island.\n\nHe is married to Jo Carole (Knopf) Lauder. They have two children, Aerin and Jane.\n\nHis daughter Jane is married to Kevin Warsh, a former member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He attended the New York School of Accounting and Pace College. In 1905, he began his own accounting firm, S.D. Leidesdorf & Co., certified public accountants, which grew and eventually became one of the largest accounting firms in the nation. The 1915 New York City Directory shows him living at 302 West 79th and with the S.D. Leidesdorf Co office at 417 5th Avenue. His World War I Draft Registration Card shows he had moved to 309 W 86th. In 1929, he helped arrange the sale of Newark-based Bamberger's department store, to the R.H. Macy Co. Fortune Magazine recognized his company as a “Pioneering Firm” in 1932.\n\nIn 1931 he was on the executive committee of the American Jewish Committee. He served on the State Council of Accountancy, from 1934 to 1942. When Einstein arrived in the US, Leidesdorf was his accountant. He soon began dedicating himself to what would become a lifetime of philanthropic endeavors for medical and educational institutions, and many other charitable causes, including the Red Cross, the United Jewish Appeal, the Young Women's Christian Association and the United Negro College Fund. \"In a letter written to Mr. S. D. Leidesdorf of New York, Rockefeller solicited Leidesdorf to serve as a member of the Foundation Committee of the UNCF, working with W. D.

In 1958, Mr. Leidesdorf received The Hundred Year Association of New York's Gold Medal Award \"in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York.\" He was a founding Trustee for the Institute for Advanced Study.\n\nIn 1948, Mr. Leidesdorf began his tenure on the board of the New York University Medical Center serving as the first Chair of the Building Committee. Later he served as the Chair of the board from 1956 until his death on September 21, 1968.\n\nHe was chairman of the board of NYU Medical Center from 1956 to 1968. At the time of his death in 1968, the firm he founded was in the top 10 of accounting firms in the United States. The company he started merged to become Ernst & Whinney in 1979 and Ernst and Young in 1989.\n\nWith his wife Elsa Grunwald, he had two children Helen and Arthur (1918–91). Arthur D. like his father, was a philanthropist. Arthur also married Tova, a prior beauty-contest winner and International Socialite, who continues his philanthropic work.

His father, Jonas Alexander, was a merchant who came to Zagreb from Güssing, Austria and his mother Roza (née Stern) was from an old influential Jewish family from Zagreb. Alexander's father was councillor at the \"Croatian commercial artisan chamber\". Alexander had a younger brother, Šandor, and two sisters, Gizela and Ilka. He attended elementary and high school in Zagreb, and a business academy in Vienna. Around 1860 his father opened a grain store in Zagreb. After his education, Alexander returned to Zagreb and started to work with his father. In 1880 he moved to Sisak where he opened another grain store for his family business. There he was introduced to his future wife, Emma (née Neumann), the daughter of Varaždin businessman Wolf Neumann. With his wife Alexander had three daughters, Vera (died as a child), Gizela and Mira, and four sons, Ivo, Božidar, Branko and Dragutin. All his children were born in Sisak. Alexander was active member of the Israelites of Zagreb community. Since 1885 he was the president of the choral society \"Danica\". In 1915 he moved back to Zagreb with his family. Alexander was member of the society \"Narodni rad - društvo židovskih asimilanata i anticionista u Hrvatskoj\" (\"Peoples work - Society of Jewish assimilates and anti Zionists in Croatia\").\n\nHe was known as an organizational genius. In 1893 Alexander bought a brewery in Sisak, \"Sisačka pivovara\". In Sisak he was elected as the representative in the city assembly and was vice president of the savings cooperatives for Sisak and surrounding areas. Alexander owned the ceramic factory \"Titanit\", chemical factory \"Danica\", cement factory \"Croatia\", colliery \"Mirna\", cooking oil factory \"Zagreb\" (now \"Zvijezda\", part of \"Agrokor\" company) and was major shareholder of Zagrebačka pivovara. Alexander co-founded the \"Zagreb Stock Exchange for the goods and values\" (now \"Zagreb Stock Exchange\") and was co-founder of \"Zagreb assembly\" (now \"Zagreb Fair\"). He was also the elected president of \"Industrialists Union\" in 1919, and board member of the \"Commercial Chamber\". Alexander also owned several residential buildings in Zagreb. In the \"Industrialists Union\" he promoted and protected Croatian industry against Hungary and its economic policy in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Under his leadership all of Croatia and Slavonia industry was assembled under the \"Industrialists Union\". Alexander donated a great deal of his profits to charity.\n\nAlexander was a great philanthropist who often aided the city of Zagreb, the poor and those in need. In 1941 during World War II, with the NDH regime in power, Alexander and his wife found refuge at the sanatorium in Klaićeva street. In 1942, Alexander and his wife moved to the sanatorium of Dr. Đuro Vranešić, known for saving 80 Jews, in Zelengaj street 57. He died there relatively peacefully at the age of 80 in 1943. Alexander was buried at the Mirogoj Cemetery. In an attempt to save themselves from the Ustaše and Nazi persecution, his family was scattered all over the world. Some of them temporarily stayed in Perugia, Italy. His wife and children survived the Holocaust. Many members of Alexander family perished during the Holocaust. His sister Ilka was killed at the Jasenovac concentration camp in 1942 together with her son in law Oton Vinski, his niece Zora was killed in 1944 at Auschwitz.\n\n"}

He is best known as a whistleblower after his December 2010 letter to Dmitry Medvedev, which exposed the corrupt scheme that included the construction of 'Putin's Palace' and challenged the Russian president to fight corruption. Articles of his in the Russian press have continued this theme.\n\nKolesnikov graduated from the Leningrad Polytechnical Institute in 1972, where he studied biophysics. He holds a doctorate from the Sergei Kirov Military Medical Academy, and spent 20 years as a scientist specialising in the applications of biophysics in medicine.\n\nIn 1991 he and scientific colleagues combined with the St Petersburg health authorities to found a state enterprise to manufacture medical equipment which they had been developing. In 1992, when it became legal, they set up a joint stock company called Petromed. Vladmir Putin, then head of the St Petersburg Committee on External Economic Affairs, was one of the founders. Petromed expanded through the 1990s from the manufacture of equipment to procurement, and from procurement to major health infrastructure projects. The election of Vladimir Yakovlev as Mayor St Petersburg was a setback for Petromed as the company did not enjoy as good relations with him as they had with Anatoly Sobchak. The publicly owned stake in the company was sold so that Kolesnikov and another of the co-founders, Dmitri Gorelov, each held a 50% stake.\n\nKolesnikov's involvement in this is described in his letter to Medvedev and has been covered by the media, notably by David Ignatius in the Washington Post, who concluded from his investigations that 'Kolesnikov is one of those brave souls a journalist meets occasionally, who decides to expose what he sees as wrongdoing, regardless of the personal risks.' In 2000 Kolesnikov was approached by Nikolai Shamalov, a contact from Petromed's early days, on behalf of Putin. Putin proposed the following scheme: Petromed would be commissioned to undertake a number of health infrastructure projects, funded by oligarchs, including Roman Abramovich. A proportion of the donations would be siphoned into an offshore investment fund, in which Putin would have by far the largest stake.\n\nThis scheme went ahead, as well as 'Project South', aka Putin's Palace, which Shamalov supervised. Kolesnikov claims that he became disillusioned when, in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, he was instructed that all funds were to be directed to Putin's Palace and investment projects on which people's livelihoods depended were to be shut down. In September 2010 he left Russia having decided to become a whistleblower. After consulting lawyers and meeting with Washington Post columnist David Ignatius he published his letter to Medvedev, which met with official denials. The plausibility of these denials has been undermined by investigations by Novaya Gazeta, which revealed a paper trail going back to the Kremlin.\n\nAsked by Masha Gessen why he had become a whistleblower he replied, 'On the one hand, it's a complicated question, on the other hand, it's simple. If you are a Russian, if Russia is your homeland, and if you have something you can do for her, then the act is perfectly natural.

On Russia today he is pessimistic, 'My analysis led to the conclusion that the country has no real positive development. The country is heading for collapse. Moreover, for a really serious collapse, possibly revolution. And considering that today Russia is a nuclear power, and that revolution in a country where there is a huge number of nuclear weapons is an incredibly dangerous thing for the existence of the whole world, I came to the conclusion that something had to be done. These were the main motives for my decision to write the letter. Well, in the end, let's say, I have lived most of my life, I've got children and grandchildren, and not just me, everyone.' \n"}

At this time, the unlimited liability of the management put the managers' personal fortune at risk in case of rumors and scandals. Hence the management hired protection, called sōkaiya, to reduce the risk of such rumors. Even after the Japanese laws included a limited liability, hence reducing the personal risk to the managers, these sōkaiya continued to prosper, and were often used to quiet down otherwise difficult meetings. In that respect, they have even been compared to corporate lawyers in America.\n\nIn 1984, the law made first steps to reduce the threat from sōkaiya by establishing a minimum number of holdings (¥50,000) in order to be allowed into the shareholder meeting, leading to a slow decline of the number of sōkaiya. In response to this, the sōkaiya formed fake uyoku dantai, announcing embarrassing company secrets, fictional or not, from loudspeakers mounted on trucks in order to extort money from companies.\n\nIn 1994, Juntarō Suzuki, vice president of Fujifilm, was murdered by sōkaiya after he stopped paying these bribes.\n\nIndividuals acquire enough stock from multiple companies in order to gain entrance to a shareholders' meeting. There, they disrupt the meeting (and embarrass the company) until their demands are met. For this, the sōkaiya often research the company in detail beforehand to uncover incidents of misconduct or other company secrets, and then blackmail the management so that these issues are not raised in the shareholder meeting or elsewhere. Often, they also invent fictional issues that the company would have a difficult time disproving.\n\nModern sōkaiya have developed other, similar methods to accomplish their goals. One less subtle example is the \"banzai sōkaiya\", who disrupt business places with their cries of \"Banzai!\" and praise of the Emperor until they are quietly paid to leave.\n\nSōkaiya also form fake groups, announcing embarrassing company secrets, fictional or not, from loudspeakers mounted on trucks in order to extort money from companies. They may also print special newspapers with topics embarrassing to companies, and then ask the company to buy the entire print at inflated prices, or even to subscribe to these newspapers, generating a steady flow of cash.\n\nSōkaiya have also been used by companies to drown out questions from legitimate shareholders which company officials do not want presented. One infamous case is related to Minamata disease (mercury poisoning), where the Chisso chemicals company managed to close a number of annual meetings within minutes even though hundreds of protesters wanted to voice their anger. They have also been active against anti-war protesters and other people who may be viewed as a nuisance by the company at a particular time.\n\nArticle 968 of the Japanese corporations code prohibits sōkaiya activity, imposing imprisonment of no more than five years or a fine of no more than ¥5 million for \"receiving, demanding or promising a proprietary benefit with regard to\" statements or the exercise of voting rights at a shareholder or creditor meeting.\n\nA practical countermeasure used by large corporations is to hold all shareholder meetings on the same day, so sōkaiya cannot disrupt all of them.\n\nWhile in the west a shareholders' meeting is usually an earnest discussion between the shareholders and the management, in Japan it is often more of a ceremony, and the management does not feel the need to truly inform shareholders. In this atmosphere, the sōkaiya are able to prosper. However, with the trend for more deregulation in the Japanese market the business environment for sōkaiya is getting more and more difficult.\n\nMajor companies that have been found guilty of employing sōkaiya include but are not limited to:\n\n\n"}

Following the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, the Terrys had fled their hometown of Cork for Catholic countries such as Spain, France and the states of the Italian peninsula. The Spanish branch, established in Cádiz and El Puerto de Santa María, became involved in trade with the Indies and Sherry production quite successfully, as in less than a decade from their arrival many of its members were knighted in the Order of Santiago and Guillermo Terry was granted the title of Marquis of la Cañada by King Philip V, on 8 September 1729.\n\nTerry initially became involved in the slave trade in Cuba, making his first $10,000 by buying sick slaves, nursing them back to health, and then reselling them healthy for a large profit. He bought the \"Caracas\" sugar mill for $23,000, and upgraded it to be the first in Cuba to use electricity. He went on to make a fortune through involvement in all aspects of the economy, from the sugar trade and slave trade to banking and imports, becoming the dominant businessman in Cienfuegos and earning the nickname the \"Cuban Croesus\". His fortune grew to be among the largest in the world, with a net worth of about $725,000 in 1851, $3,090,00 in 1860, $7,890,000 in 1870, $13,760,000 in 1880, and over $25,000,000 at his death in 1886, which occurred in Paris, where he was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery (division 92).\n\nOn 31 October 1837, Terry married Teresa Dorticós y Gómez de Leys, daughter of Andrés Dorticós, a prominent local merchant and governor of Cienfuegos, and María del Carmen Gómez de Leys y La Puente.

United States was a 2003 decision in the United States Court of International Trade that determined that for purposes of tariffs, Toy Biz's action figures were toys, not dolls, because they represented \"nonhuman creatures\". This decision effectively halved the tariff rate, from 12 percent tax to 6.8 percent.\n\nThe Harmonized Tariff Schedule in U.S. law distinguished between two types of action figures for determining tariffs: dolls, which are defined to include human figures, and toys, which include \"nonhuman creatures\". Because duties on dolls were higher than those on toys, Marvel Comics subsidiary Toy Biz argued before the U.S. Court of International Trade, that their action figures (including the X-Men and Fantastic Four) represented \"nonhuman creatures\" and were subject to the lower tariff rates for toys instead of the higher ones for dolls. On January 3, 2003, after examining more than 60 action figures, Judge Judith Barzilay ruled in their favor, granting Toy Biz reimbursement for import taxes on previous toys.\n\nBecause a common theme in Marvel Comics had been the struggle for mutants like the X-Men to prove their humanity, the case shocked numerous fans. Marvel responded to these concerns by claiming \"our heroes are living, breathing human beingsbut humans who have extraordinary abilities ... A decision that the X-Men figures indeed do have 'nonhuman' characteristics further proves our characters have special, out-of-this world powers\".\n\nThe Harmonized Tariff Schedule was amended to eliminate the distinction between dolls and other toys, which are now in the same category.\n\n"}

He was a member of the Sudairi Seven, a powerful faction of brothers within the Al Saud. His parents were Ibn Saud and Hassa Al Sudairi. He was known as Turki \"the second\" (الثاني \"ath-thānī\") because he was the second son born to Ibn Saud named \"Turki\". The first Prince Turki was Abdulaziz's first son who died in 1919 due to Spanish flu.\n\nPrince Turki studied at the Princes' School established by his father.\n\nTurki bin Abdulaziz assumed the Riyadh principality delegation on 10 October 1957, because Prince Salman, (later to become King Salman) then-Riyadh governor, travelled with King Saud to Lebanon. In 1960, the approval of the King was issued to assign Prince Turki as the governor of the Riyadh Province in the period of the formal vacation of Prince Salman. Turki bin Abdulaziz was appointed the deputy defense minister in July 1969 by a royal order. His tenure lasted for nine years and he was forced to resign from office due to his marriage in 1978.\n\nAfter his falling-out with other princes and joining with the free princes group, Turki bin Abdulaziz moved to Cairo and lived there in self-imposed exile for a time. However, other research on the Free Princes Movement does not mention his name as part of this group; so an alternate explanation of his self-exile in Cairo offers that it occurred as a result of an intra-family dispute due to his marriage to Hind Al Fassi (See also below and \"Personal life\" section).\n\nIn February 1982, Turki bin Abdulaziz and his family, while living in Miami, were accused of holding an Egyptian servant against her will. Officers from the Metro Dade Police Department (MDPD) searched his apartment with a warrant but failed to find the woman. However, the police encountered fierce resistance from Prince Turki's bodyguards. He eventually sued the MDPD for $210 million, wherein the defendant then launched a countersuit. The State Department granted him diplomatic immunity in April 1982 and the lawsuit was dropped in June 1982.\n\nIn a letter published by Wagze news agency in July 2010, Prince Turki is reported to have warned Saudi Arabia's ruling family of a fate similar to that of Iraq's executed dictator Saddam Hussein and the ousted Iranian Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, calling on them to escape before people \"cut off our heads in streets.\" He argued that the Saudi royal family was no longer able to \"impose\" itself on people, arguing that deviations in carrying out the religious concepts that make up the basis of the Saudi government \"have gotten out of our hands,\" so that the opposition views our acts as \"interfering in people's private life and restricting their liberties.\"\nHe further urged \"Do it today before tomorrow as long as the money we have is enough for us to live anywhere in the world; from Switzerland to Canada and Australia…we should not return as long as we are able to get out safely, we must take our families quickly and pull out.\", continuing \"Do not fool yourself by relying on the United States or Britain or Israel, because they will not survive the loss; the only door open is now the exit door of no return. Let us go before it closes.\" He finally warned against a military coup against the ruling family, saying \"no one will attack us from outside but our armed forces will attack us.\" However, later Turki bin Abdulaziz told Saudi Press Agency that the alleged letter to him circulated by some media and internet sites was nonexistent and fabricated by enemy parties wishing to spread confusion and excitement.\n\nAnother controversy he experienced was about the death of his wife Hind al Fassi in August 2010. Her brother Allal al Fassi accused his brother-in-law, Prince Turki as well as his nephew and niece of killing his sister with a drug overdose. He submitted a report to the Attorney General and then, disappeared for 24 hours and reappeared after the medical report proved that there was nothing wrong in her system, leading to the withdrawal of all his accusations to his brother in law. On the other hand, Prince Turki's son, Abdul Rahman, sued his uncle Allal al Fassi claiming that he beat him and his father in the hospital where his mother died.\n\nSo, as a total result, although in 2012 he was left as Hussa's eldest son, he was of course bypassed for the throne.\n\nDuring the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, Prince Turki argued in a press conference that the United Nations' embargo was not enough to drive the Iraqi army out of Kuwait. For him, military action was required to achieve it.\n\nAfter returning to Saudi Arabia in 2011, Prince Turki fully supported the appointments of his younger brothers, late Prince Nayef and Prince Salman. He argued in October 2011 that the decision to appoint late Prince Nayef as Crown Prince was totally right and that Prince Nayef had wisdom, sound management and long history in serving the country.\n\nTurki bin Abdulaziz's first wife whom he divorced to marry Hind Al Fassi was Noura bint Abdallah bin Abdul Rahman.\nHis second wife was Hind Al Fassi, a member of the Saudi Arabian al-Fassi family and daughter of Sheikh Shams ed-din Al Fassi, a Sufi religious leader from the Shadhili order, and great-grandson of Moroccan Sufi Imam al-Fassi, a Hasani Idrissi descendant of Prophet Mohammed, who had settled in Mecca in the late 18th-century. Turki bin Abdulaziz sacrificed his position as deputy defense minister and moved from the Kingdom into a self exile because he refused to divorce her in late 1970s. Therefore, he lost not only his position but also his candidacy for the Saudi Throne. Later, he and his wife went to Egypt in the late 1970s and never returned to Saudi Arabia together again. She died in 2010 in Cairo at the age of 57. After her death, Prince Turki returned to Saudi Arabia.\n\nPrince Turki had four sons from his first marriage, Prince Khalid (born December 1957), Prince Sultan (born May 1968), Prince Faisal (born January 1965) and Prince Fahd (born August 1959). In 1975, Prince Turki's elder sons took $1.1 million loan from the U.S. Export-Import Bank (Eximbank) to finance their business in relation to rice mills in Saudi Arabia.\n\nOne of Prince Turki's daughters is married to Khalid bin Sultan. His son, Sultan bin Turki II bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, was \"kidnapped\" in Geneva and placed under house arrest in Riyadh in 2004 after he spoke out in favour of reform in Saudi Arabia. Another son, Faisal bin Turki, is an adviser at the ministry of petroleum and natural resources.\n\nPrince Turki died on 11 November 2016. He was buried at Al Oud cemetery in Riyadh.\n"}

VLJs are considered the lightest business jets and are approved for single-pilot operation.\n\nThere were early attempts to create small jet aircraft in this class in the 1970s and 1980s, such as the CMC Leopard.\n\nAfter a flurry of interest in the Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS) and air taxi markets in the early 2000s, the VLJ sector underwent significant expansion. Several new designs were produced, such as the Embraer Phenom 100, the Cessna Citation Mustang, and the Eclipse 500. However, following the late 2000s recession the air taxi market underperformed expectations, and both Eclipse Aviation and air taxi firm DayJet collapsed. In December 2010, AvWeb's Paul Bertorelli explained that the term \"very light jet\" has lost favor in the aviation industry. \"Personal jet is the description du jour. You don't hear the term VLJ—very light jet—much anymore and some people in the industry tell me they think it's because that term was too tightly coupled to Eclipse, a failure that the remaining players want to, understandably, distance themselves from.\"\n\nSingle-engine designs were popular in the mid-2000s, before the global financial crisis diminished the market appeal of the category. Most of those programs, which included the Piper Altaire, Diamond D-Jet, Eclipse 400 and VisionAire Vantage, were all shelved and the only maintained aircraft are the Cirrus Vision SF50, which is now type certified and in production, and the Stratos 714, which expects certification in 2019. They are expected to compete with single turboprop aircraft.\n\nTwo VLJs in history have won the Collier Trophy, known as the most prestigious aerospace engineering award in the United States — the Eclipse 500 (in 2006) and the Cirrus Vision Jet (in 2018).\n\nVLJs are intended to have lower operating costs than conventional jets, and to be able to operate from runways as short as , either for personal use or in point-to-point air taxi service. In the United States, the Small Aircraft Transportation System is aimed at providing air service to areas ignored by airlines.\n\nFlorida-based air taxi provider DayJet, which on October 3, 2007 began its Eclipse 500 service, planned to operate more than 1,000 of the VLJs within five years, and had stated in mid-2007 that it planned to operate 300 Eclipse 500s serving 40 regional airports in the Southeastern United States by the end of 2008. DayJet ceased operations on September 19, 2008.\n\nMany models are under development or awaiting certification, while others have failed. Six have so far made deliveries to customers:\n\nThe Cessna Citation Mustang was the first production VLJ, first delivered in November 2006, and the Cirrus Vision SF50 is the first single-engine production VLJ, beginning deliveries in December 2016.\n\nBusiness jet sales were suffering due to the ongoing late 2000s recession. The General Aviation Manufacturers Association reported in November 2010 that third quarter business jet sales were down 20.3% over the same period in 2009, with light jets suffering the most. Industry analysts PMi suggest that 1,700 VLJs will be delivered between 2013 and 2020, compared to 1,000 delivered up to 2013.\n\nWhen these smaller jets were first mooted, there was much interest in the fact that they would not have a lavatory on board, with articles discussing the matter in \"The New York Times\" and items on NBC Nightly News. Some manufacturers argued that for short flights of and 40 to 80 minutes' duration the lavatory issue was not a problem and air taxi service companies said that it was not a concern for most of their passengers. Despite this, the Eclipse 500 had the option of an electric flush, remove-to-service lavatory with a privacy curtain - at the expense of one passenger seat, and the proposed Adam A700 design had a seven-seat configuration with rear lavatory with a privacy curtain. The Cessna Mustang also has an emergency toilet, but it is located between the cockpit and cabin. The Embraer Phenom 100 offers a fully enclosed lavatory with a solid door. The 2015 Honda HA-420 HondaJet has a full lavatory at the rear of the aircraft with flushing toilet, full sink and closing door.\n\n\n"}

The company invests in office buildings and street retail in Manhattan.\n\nNotable properties wholly owned by the company include the following:\n\nThe company also owns:\n\nThe origins of the company can be traced back to the Two Guys discount store chain, founded in 1947 by brothers Sidney and Herbert Hubschman. In 1959, Two Guys acquired O. A. Sutton Corporation, manufacturers of the Vornado line of electric fans, and the company was renamed Vornado Inc.\n\nBy 1964, the company operated over 200 stores. In the 1970s, Vornado began divesting its retail operations. In 1978, the company sold 80 Two Guys locations in California.\n\nIn 1980, Interstate Properties Inc., a real estate development company controlled by Steven Roth, acquired an 18% stake in Vornado, since Roth became interested in the company's real estate holdings. In 1981, Interstate Properties took control of the firm after winning a proxy struggle against existing management and closed additional stores, reducing the number of stores in operation to 12.\n\nIn 1986, Interstate Properties and Donald Trump each bought approximately 20% of Alexander's, a failing retailer whose real estate holdings included a store that occupied the entire block between East 58th and 59th streets and Lexington and Third Avenues in Manhattan.\n\nIn 1988, they each raised their stakes to 27% of the company, but Trump pledged his interest as collateral for a personal loan from Citicorp and in 1991, Trump was forced to turn over his holdings to Citibank.\n\nIn 1992, Roth and Alexander's creditors forced Alexander's into bankruptcy. \n\nAlexander's emerged from bankruptcy in 1993 as a real estate investment trust. That same year, Vornado Inc. was converted into a REIT, Vornado Realty Trust. In 1995, Vornado bought Citicorp's interest in Alexander's.\n\nIn 1989, the Vornado name was licensed to Vornado Air, LLC, a new company formed to manufacture heating and cooling equipment. Outside of the brand licensing agreement, the Trust has no modern relation to Vornado Air, LLC.\n\nIn April 1997, the company acquired a company owned by Bernard H. Mendik in a $654 million stock transaction that added a large portfolio of office buildings in Manhattan to Vornado's assets. Mendik became co-chairman of Vornado until his resignation in October 1998.\n\nOn February 15, 2001, the Port Authority announced that Vornado Realty Trust had won the bid for a 99-year lease for the World Trade Center, offering $3.25 billion. Silverstein Properties was outbid by $30 million by Vornado. However, Vornado balked over lease terms and possible tax liabilities. Silverstein signed a lease for the World Trade Center in April 2001, 5 months before the September 11 attacks.\n\nIn 2001, the company acquired Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty, owner of a portfolio of assets primarily in Arlington, Virginia, in a $1.58 billion transaction. Robert H. Smith and Robert P. Kogod were added to the board of directors of Vornado.\n\nIn 2005, the company bought a 32.5% interest in Toys \"R\" Us.\n\nIn 2013, Steven Roth replaced Michael D. Fascitelli as CEO of Vornado. Fascitelli had been CEO since 2009.\n\nIn 2015, the company spun off its interest in Urban Edge Properties to its shareholders.\n\nIn 2017, the company merged its Charles E. Smith Companies subsidiary into the JBG Companies, forming JBG Smith.\n\nOn September 18, 2017, Toys \"R\" Us, Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, stating the move would give it flexibility to deal with $5 billion in long-term debt, borrow $2 billion so it can pay suppliers for the upcoming holiday season and invest in improving current operations.\n\nOn October 8, 2018, it was reported that the company is not adding to the fund dedicated to former employees of Toys \"R\" Us.\n"}
