When news of the Hatfields' preparations for war reached the McCoy side, the Hatfields were already en route to invade the McCoy territory, so Frank Phillips, the leader of the McCoy posse, rounded up every able man he could and led his posse to intercept the invading Hatfields. Both sides eventually met around the area of the Grapevine Creek on the West Virginia side of the Tug Fork River and began exchanging shots at each other. One group of the McCoy side managed to lure the Hatfields into one area of the battlefield while another group of McCoys moved to outflank them, which caused the Hatfields to suffer multiple casualties and made them retreat. A number of Hatfields did not manage to escape and were taken prisoner by the McCoys.\n\nAs a result of the McCoys scoring victory over the Hatfields and taking multiple prisoners both from the battle and prior to the battle, they put all of the Hatfield prisoners on trial with the permission of the Kentucky government for the various crimes they had committed during the feud, mainly the murder of the Randall McCoy's sons for killing Ellison Hatfield and the killing of one of his daughters during the New Year's Eve massacre.

While the impetus for its founding was to defend employer interests in bargaining and labour disputes, the Federation emphasised that this did not entail opposition to workers seeking to advance their legitimate interests, and that it supported profit-sharing, co-partnership and the work of labour organisations in working for fair terms and conditions for their members.\n\nThe Federation was founded for the overall purpose of ongoing advocacy on behalf of business, economic and community wellbeing.\n\nIn 1905 the constitution of the Employers Federation of New Zealand was formally adopted.\n\nBy 1908 the Federation represented around 6,000 members.\n\nThroughout the Great War (1914-1918), the Great Depression of the 1930s, World War II (1939-1945) and the ensuing post-war boom, the Federation advocated for business, economic and community wellbeing, and worked constructively with all successive governments.\n\nIn 1951 the Employers Federation became an incorporated society and by 1971 represented around 10,000 members.\n\nIn 2001 the New Zealand Employers Federation merged with the New Zealand Manufacturers Federation to form Business New Zealand (BusinessNZ),\nadvancing the scope of the new organisation to cover greater numbers and types of businesses.\n\nFrom 2009 BusinessNZ established new divisions to promote manufacturing, exporting, energy companies, larger businesses and companies working towards environmental sustainability:\n\n\nMembership is drawn from the Major Companies Group and from four of New Zealand's largest regional business organisations:\n\n\nBusinessNZ's Major Companies Group (MCG) helps ensure that New Zealand's largest companies are heard in policy, business and economic debate.

Its Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) number is 10506. It is governed by a Board of Trustees.\n\nThe legacy of Business and Professional Women/USA began in 1919.\n\nWhile mobilizing for World War I, the U.S. Government recognized the need for a cohesive group to coordinate identification of women's available skills and experience. A Women's War Council, financed through a federal grant, was established by the War Department to organize the resources of professional women. It was guided principally by executives of the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA). The National Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs was founded on July 16, 1919, at a meeting led by Lena Madesin Phillips of Kentucky. In the 1930s it became a charter member of the International Federation of Business and Professional Women.\n\nBPW/USA became the first organization created to focus on the issues of working women. BPW worked throughout the 1930s to prohibit legislation or directives denying jobs to married women and lobbied successfully to legislatively end the legal practice of workplace preference for unmarried persons and, in the case of married persons, preference for males. BPW/USA was one of the first women's organizations to endorse the Equal Rights Amendment in 1937. \n\nAt the advent of World War II, BPW developed a classification system for women with specialized skills critical to the war effort and supported the formation of women's branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. While wage discrimination has existed in the U.S. since women and minorities first entered the paid workforce, its prevalence was not felt until the massive influx of women sought work during World War II. Immediately following the war, the Women's Pay Act of 1945 - the first ever legislation to require equal pay - was introduced in the U.S. Congress. It was another 18 years before an equal pay bill made its way to the President's desk to be signed into law.\n\nBPW Foundation was incorporated in 1956 as the first foundation dedicated to providing resources to and about working women. It included research, information, career development programs, workshops and other training opportunities. The Marguerite Rawalt Resource Center, established in 1980 and put on-line 2006, is a major resource for information and documents on the history of women and women in the workplace.\nThe establishment of \"Status of Women\" commissions in the U.S. in 1963 was due largely to BPW efforts. President John F. Kennedy recognized BPW's leading role in securing passage of the Equal Pay Act by giving BPW's National President the first pen he used when signing the Act into law.\n\nVirginia Allan initiated the \"Young Careerist\" Program to develop the business and presentation skills of young women between 25–35 years of age. The first National Legislative Conference, held in 1963 in D.C., later developed into BPW's current Policy & Action Conference, where members lobby Congress and the Administration on BPW's legislative issues.\n\nBPW tackled \"comparable worth\" by calling for newspapers to stop the occupational segregation in classified ads (clustering of women in a few restricted occupations of low-paying, dead-end jobs). Numerous state and municipal governments revamped their pay scales, recognizing dissimilar jobs may not be identical, but may be composed of tasks, educational requirements, experience and other characteristics that are equivalent or comparable. In 1986, San Francisco became the first city in the nation to approve a pay equity referendum, implementing $34 million in increases for employees in female and minority-dominated jobs. Continuing with BPW's focus on workplace issues, BPW lobbied Congress for passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act, which finally passed in 1993.\nDiscussions on comparable worth were expanded to include enforcement and strengthening of existing Equal Pay legislation. The Pay Equity Employment Act of 1994, followed by the Equal Pay Act (introduced in 1994) and the Paycheck Fairness Act (introduced in 1997) became BPW's focus legislation through the '90s. Then-Secretary of Labor, Elizabeth Dole, and First Lady Barbara Bush addressed BPW's members at the White House Briefing during the 1990 \"Lobby Day\" event. Subsequent speakers have included Senator Tom Harkin, First Lady (Senator) Hillary Clinton and Congresswomen Rosa DeLauro and Eleanor Holmes Norton.\n\nIn 2005, BPW used its grassroots power to continue the Bureau of Labor and Statistics' (BLS) Working Women Series and to re-instate Lifetime TV on the DISH Network programming. During this same year in October, BPW/USA launched Women Joining Forces:Closing Ranks, Opening Doors (WJF), a program to support women veterans as they transition from military to civilian life. This commitment made BPW/USA the first and only non-governmental agency to offer programming that supports women veterans. \nWorkplace equity issues including sexual harassment, opportunities for women veterans, work-life balance, health care reform, dependent care, tort reform, increasing the minimum wage, lifetime economic security and pay equity continue to be BPW's targeted issues.\n\nIn 2009 BPW Foundation merged with its sister organization BPW/USA.\n\n\nThe \"*\" denotes the following:\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is contrasted with the remainder of the software that might be concerned with lower-level details of managing a database or displaying the user interface, system infrastructure, or generally connecting various parts of the program.\n\nBusiness logic:\n\nBusiness rules:\n\nBusiness logic comprises:\n\nBusiness logic should be distinguished from business rules. Business logic is the portion of an enterprise system which determines how data is transformed or calculated, and how it is routed to people or software (workflow). Business rules are formal expressions of business policy. Anything that is a process or procedure is business logic, and anything that is neither a process nor a procedure is a business rule. Welcoming a new visitor is a process (workflow) consisting of steps to be taken, whereas saying every new visitor must be welcomed is a business rule. Further, business logic is procedural whereas business rules are declarative.\n\nFor example, an e-commerce website might allow visitors to add items to a shopping cart, specify a shipping address, and supply payment information. The business logic of the website might include a workflow such as:\n\nThere will be also business rules of the website:\n\nThe web site software also contains other code which is not considered part of business logic nor business rules:\n\nBusiness logic could be anywhere in a program. For example, given a certain format for an address, a database table could be created which has columns that correspond exactly to the fields specified in the business logic, and type checks added to make sure that no invalid data is added.\n\nBusiness logic often changes. For example, the set of allowable address formats might change when an online retailer starts shipping products to a new country. Thus it is often seen as desirable to make the code that implements the business logic relatively isolated, or loosely coupled. This makes it more likely that changes to business logic will require a small set of code changes, in only one part of the code. Distant but strongly coupled code also creates more of a risk that the programmer will only make some of the necessary changes and miss part of the system, leading to incorrect operation.\n\nA multitier architecture formalizes this decoupling by creating a business logic layer which is separate from other tiers or layers, such as the data access layer or service layer. Each layer \"knows\" only a minimal amount about the code in the other layers - just enough to accomplish necessary tasks. For example, in a model–view–controller paradigm, the controller and view layers, might be made as small as possible, with all the business logic concentrated in the model. In the e-commerce example, the controller determines the sequence of web pages in the checkout sequence, and is also responsible for validating that email, address, and payment information satisfy the business rules (rather than leaving any of that up to the database itself or lower-level database access code).\n\nAlternative paradigms are possible. For example, with relatively simple business entities, a generic view and controller could access database objects which themselves contain all the relevant business logic about what formats they accept and what changes are possible (known as the database model).\n\nSome tiered schemes use either a distinct application layer or a service layer, or consider the business logic layer to be the same as one of those.\n\nBusiness logic can be extracted from procedural code using a business rule management system (BRMS).\n\nThe business rules approach of software development uses BRMSs and enforces a very strong separation of business logic from other code. User interface management systems are another technology used to enforce a strong separation between business logic and other code. The magic pushbutton is considered an \"anti-pattern\": a technique that in this case creates undesirable constraints which make it difficult to code business logic in an easy-to-maintain way.\n\nA domain model is an abstract representation of the data storage types required by business rules.\n\n\n\n"}

More formally,\n\nformula_5\n\nThere are two main definitions of a drawdown:\n\nIn finance, the use of the maximum drawdown as an indicator of risk is particularly popular in the world of commodity trading advisors through the widespread use of three performance measures: the Calmar ratio, the Sterling ratio and the Burke ratio. These measures can be considered as a modification of the Sharpe ratio in the sense that the numerator is always the excess of mean returns over the risk-free rate while the standard deviation of returns in the denominator is replaced by some function of the drawdown.\n\nMany assume Max DD Duration is the length of time between new highs during which the Max DD (magnitude) occurred. But that isn’t always the case. The Max DD duration is the longest time between peaks, period. So it could be the time when the program also had its biggest peak to valley loss (and usually is, because the program needs a long time to recover from the largest loss), but it doesn’t have to be.\n\nWhen \"X\" is Brownian motion with drift, the expected behavior of the MDD as a function of\ntime is known.

Two indices, the World Competitiveness Scoreboard (WCS) developed by the International Institute for Management Development (IMD) and the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) built by the World Economic Forum (WEF) have come to dominate the field of competitiveness studies.\n\nThe International Institute for Management Development WCS and the World Economic Forum the Global Competitiveness Index view national competitiveness akin to how business-friendly a nation is, and focus upon economic and market indicators. As such, if a nation is a good place for foreign firms to do business and make money, it will, as a result, be viewed as competitive. Following this logic, the role played by a government then, is mainly restricted to constructing an environment that is attractive to businesses.\n\nStressing the broader fields of government activities, several institutions have started to develop indicators emphasizing the role of government in driving development and national competitiveness. Prominent examples include The World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) and the Quality of Government Institute’s (QGI) (the University of Gothenburg) Quality of Government indicators(QoG).\n\nWhile these two indices constitute important steps toward improving our understanding of how government contributes toward competitiveness, they have also revealed numerous theoretical and methodological shortcomings related to the study of governments’ role in fostering national competitiveness.\n\nSince 2011, Center for Government Competitiveness (director: Tobin Im) has developed the GC index mainly focusing on government capacities and roles in national development. After investigating the limited capabilities of existing competitiveness indicators to define and measure the level of GC, the CGC has tried to develop a novel approach to conceptualizing and measuring GC. According to Ho and Im (2012), the concept of GC can be defined as “the power of government to, in light of various constraints, take resources from in and outside of the country and improve social, economic and cultural conditions of the nation in order to sustainably enhance citizens’ quality of life.” Moreover, the concepts of ‘constraints’ and ‘quality of life’ can be interpreted in various ways, depending on a nation's unique environments.\n\nBy considering different experiences and policy practices between developed countries and developing countries, the CGC measures the level of government competitiveness by applying different criteria to OECD and non-OECD countries. The seven fields of government activities both OECD and non-OECD countries have in common are followings: economy, education, health and welfare, agriculture and food, ICT, energy and environment, and governance. For OECD countries, three more fields are added: research and development, culture and tourism, and disaster management. Meanwhile, non-OECD countries have nine fields of government activities in total including infrastructure and safety.\n\nThe CGC builds the GC index based on David Easton's system theory as a theoretical framework. Therefore, the GC Index first analyzes competitiveness through each of the four levels- input, throughput (public management capacity), output, and outcome. The index then aggregates results from each level to produce an overall competitiveness score. This approach generates a variety of policy implications at each systemic level. The following are some sub-categories for each stage\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "384081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=384081", "title": "Health Level 7", "text": "Health Level 7\n\nHealth Level-7 or HL7 refers to a set of international standards for transfer of clinical and administrative data between software applications used by various healthcare providers. These standards focus on the application layer, which is \"layer 7\" in the OSI model. The HL7 standards are produced by the Health Level Seven International, an international standards organization, and are adopted by other standards issuing bodies such as American National Standards Institute and International Organization for Standardization.\n\nHospitals and other healthcare provider organizations typically have many different computer systems used for everything from billing records to patient tracking. All of these systems should communicate with each other (or \"interface\") when they receive new information, or when they wish to retrieve information, but not all do so.\n\nHL7 International specifies a number of flexible standards, guidelines, and methodologies by which various healthcare systems can communicate with each other. Such guidelines or data standards are a set of rules that allow information to be shared and processed in a uniform and consistent manner. These data standards are meant to allow healthcare organizations to easily share clinical information. Theoretically, this ability to exchange information should help to minimize the tendency for medical care to be geographically isolated and highly variable.\n\nHL7 International considers the following standards to be its primary standards – those standards that are most commonly used and implemented:\nOther HL7 standards/methodologies include:\n\nHL7's primary standards are those standards that Health Level Seven International considers to be most commonly used and implemented.\n\nThe HL7 version 2 standard (also known as Pipehat) has the aim to support hospital workflows. It was originally created in 1989.\n\nHL7 version 2 defines a series of electronic messages to support administrative, logistical, financial as well as clinical processes. Since 1987 the standard has been updated regularly, resulting in versions 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.3.1, 2.4, 2.5, 2.5.1, 2.6, 2.7, 2.7.1, 2.8, 2.8.1 and 2.8.2. The v2.x standards are backward compatible (e.g., a message based on version 2.3 will be understood by an application that supports version 2.6).\n\nHL7 v2.x messages use a non-XML encoding syntax based on segments (lines) and one-character delimiters. Segments have composites (fields) separated by the composite delimiter. A composite can have sub-composites (components) separated by the sub-composite delimiter, and sub-composites can have sub-sub-composites (subcomponents) separated by the sub-sub-composite delimiter. The default delimiters are carriage return for the segment separator, vertical bar or pipe (codice_1) for the field separator, caret (codice_2) for the component separator, ampersand (codice_3) for the subcomponent separator, and hashtag/pound (#) is the default truncation separator. The tilde (codice_4) is the default repetition separator. Each segment starts with a 3-character string that identifies the segment type. Each segment of the message contains one specific category of information. Every message has codice_5 as its first segment, which includes a field that identifies the message type. The message type determines the expected segment types in the message. The segment types used in a particular message type are specified by the segment grammar notation used in the HL7 standards.\n\nThe following is an example of an admission message. codice_5 is the header segment, codice_7 the Patient Identity, codice_8 is the Patient Visit information, etc. The 2nd field in the codice_7 segment is the patient's name, in the order, family name, given name, second names (or their initials), suffix, etc. Depending on the HL7 V2.x standard version, more fields are available in the segment for additional patient information.\n\nHL7 v2.x has allowed for the interoperability between electronic Patient Administration Systems (PAS), Electronic Practice Management (EPM) systems, Laboratory Information Systems (LIS), Dietary, Pharmacy and Billing systems as well as Electronic Medical Record (EMR) or Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems. Currently, the HL7 v2.x messaging standard is supported by every major medical information systems vendor in the United States.\n\nThe HL7 version 3 standard has the aim to support all healthcare workflows. Development of version 3 started around 1995, resulting in an initial standard publication in 2005. The v3 standard, as opposed to version 2, is based on a formal methodology (the HDF) and object-oriented principles.\n\nRIM - ISO/HL7 21731\n\nThe Reference Information Model (RIM) is the cornerstone of the HL7 Version 3 development process and an essential part of the HL7 V3 development methodology. RIM expresses the data content needed in a specific clinical or administrative context and provides an explicit representation of the semantic and lexical connections that exist between the information carried in the fields of HL7 messages.\n\nHL7 Development Framework - ISO/HL7 27931\n\nThe HL7 Version 3 Development Framework (HDF) is a continuously evolving process that seeks to develop specifications that facilitate interoperability between healthcare systems. The HL7 RIM, vocabulary specifications, and model-driven process of analysis and design combine to make HL7 Version 3 one methodology for development of consensus-based standards for healthcare information system interoperability. The HDF is the most current edition of the HL7 V3 development methodology.\n\nThe HDF not only documents messaging, but also the processes, tools, actors, rules, and artifacts relevant to development of all HL7 standard specifications. Eventually, the HDF will encompass all of the HL7 standard specifications, including any new standards resulting from analysis of electronic health record architectures and requirements.\n\nHL7 specifications draw upon codes and vocabularies from a variety of sources. The V3 vocabulary work ensures that the systems implementing HL7 specifications have an unambiguous understanding of the code sources and code value domains they are using.\n\nV3 Messaging\n\nThe HL7 version 3 messaging standard defines a series of Secure Text messages (called \"interactions\") to support all healthcare workflows.\n\nHL7 v3 messages are based on an XML encoding syntax, as shown in this example:\n<POLB_IN224200 ITSVersion=\"XML_1.0\" xmlns=\"urn:hl7-org:v3\"\n</POLB_IN224200>\n\nThe HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) is an XML-based markup standard intended to specify the encoding, structure and semantics of clinical documents for exchange. The standard was jointly published with ISO as ISO/HL7 27932.\n\nCCD is a US specification for the exchange of medical summaries, based on CDA.\n\nSPL describes the published information that accompanies a medicine, based on HL7 Version 3.\n\nCCOW, or \"Clinical Context Object Workgroup,\" is a standard protocol designed to enable disparate applications to share user context and patient context in real-time, and at the user-interface level. CCOW implementations typically require a CCOW vault system to manage user security between applications.\n\nFast Healthcare Interoperability Resources is a draft standard from HL7 International designed to be easier to implement, more open and more extensible than version 2.x or version 3. It leverages a modern web-based suite of API technology, including a HTTP-based RESTful protocol, HTML and Cascading Style Sheets for user interface integration, a choice of JSON or XML for data representation, OAuth for authorization and ATOM for query results.\n\nThe HL7 Services-Aware Enterprise Architecture Framework (SAIF) provides consistency between all HL7 artifacts, and enables a standardized approach to Enterprise Architecture (EA) development and implementation, and a way to measure the consistency.\n\nSAIF is a way of thinking about producing specifications that explicitly describe the governance, conformance, compliance, and behavioral semantics that are needed to achieve computable semantic working interoperability. The intended information transmission technology might use a messaging, document exchange, or services approach.\n\nSAIF is the framework that is required to rationalize interoperability of other standards. SAIF is an architecture for achieving interoperability, but it is not a whole-solution design for enterprise architecture management.\n\nThe Arden syntax is a language for encoding medical knowledge. HL7 International adopted and oversees the standard beginning with Arden syntax 2.0. These Medical Logic Modules (MLMs) are used in the clinical setting as they can contain sufficient knowledge to make single medical decisions. They can produce alerts, diagnoses, and interpretations along with quality assurance function and administrative support. An MLM must run on a computer that meets the minimum system requirements and has the correct program installed. Then, the MLM can give advice for when and where it is needed.\n\nA large portion of HL7 messaging is transported by Minimal Lower Layer Protocol (MLLP), also known as Lower Layer Protocol (LLP). For transmitting via TCP/IP, header and trailer characters are added to the message to identify the beginning and ending of the message because TCP/IP is a continuous stream of bytes. Hybrid Lower Layer Protocol (HLLP) is a variation of MLLP that includes a checksum to help verify message integrity. Amongst other software vendors, MLLP is supported by Microsoft, Oracle and Cleo.\n\nFunctional specifications for an electronic health record.\n\nAn ORB Segment carries information about an exam, diagnostic study/observation. It is a required segment in an ORM (order message) or an ORU (Observation Result) message.\n\n\n\n"}

The company ranked 64th in the 2016 Fortune 500.\n\nIn December 2016, Tianhai Investment (now known as HNA Technology), an associate company of HNA Group, acquired Ingram Micro in an all-cash transaction \n\nIngram Micro's origins trace back to the founding of distributor Micro D, Inc. in July 1979 by husband and wife team, Geza Czige and Lorraine Mecca, who were both teachers. The company started in Southern California and in its first year of business achieved approximately $3.5 million in sales. It rapidly expanded nationwide and held its public offering in 1983. Ingram Industries became a majority stockholder of Micro D in February 1986 when it acquired all of the common stock held by the company's founders, followed by the purchase of the remaining Micro D shares in March 1989.\n\nMeanwhile in 1982, just three years after the founding of Micro D, entrepreneurs Ronald Schreiber, Irwin Schreiber, Gerald Lippes and Paul Willax founded Software Distribution Services in Buffalo, N.Y. Ingram Distribution Group, a unit of the privately held Ingram Industries, acquired Software Distribution Services in the spring of 1985 and renamed it Ingram Software. Ingram Software expanded in December 1985 with the purchase of Softeam, a Compton, Calif.-based distributor. The operation was renamed Ingram Computer in February 1988.\n\nAfter acquiring the remaining publicly traded shares of Micro D in 1989, Ingram Industries merged these two former competitors to create the microcomputer industry's first $1 billion computer products wholesale distribution company, renaming it Ingram Micro D . The new company established headquarters in Santa Ana, Calif., and retained an East Coast operations center for sales, credit, technical support and customer service in Buffalo, N.Y. The “D” was dropped from the company's name in January 1991, creating Ingram Micro.\n\nIn 1996, 17 years after the founding of Micro D, Ingram Micro once again became a public company, listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). That year, the company’s revenues totaled more than $12 billion.In 1989 Ingram Micro, then called \"Ingram Micro-D\", was a subsidiary of the privately owned Ingram Industries group, took over the Belgian Softinvest and its three Softeurop subsidiaries active on the Belgian, the French and the Dutch markets from Brussels, Lille and Utrecht. This was Ingram's first foray outside the United States other than a few Ingram Industries subsidiaries. The company embarked on an active merge, acquisitions and foundation strategy in the European market.\n\nIn August 1993, Ingram Micro Belgium acquired Zaventem Electronic Dealer Distribution (Zedd) and much of its assets, including the right to distribute Hewlett Packard products.\n\nIn July 2005 Ingram Micro purchased AVAD, LLC, a wholesale distributor for home automation and A/V gear.

{"id": "28327044", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28327044", "title": "Jean Baptiste August Kessler", "text": "Jean Baptiste August Kessler\n\nJean Baptiste August Kessler (15 December 1853 – 14 December 1900) was a Dutch entrepreneur and oil explorer who was largely responsible for the growth and development of the Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., now known as Royal Dutch Shell.\n\nKessler, who was known by his middle name August, was born in a family of 12 children, four of whom died in infancy. He became managing director of the Royal Dutch nearly from its inception. Aeilko Jans Zijlker acquired the original oil concession in Indonesia and the \"Royal\" imprimatur but died suddenly of a tropical disease in 1890. The board of directors turned to Kessler, who was a son-in-law of Geldolph Adriaan De Lange, one of the directors, to head a committee of inquiry into whether the faltering enterprise was still viable. He took the post with the understanding he would be made managing director and run the company. Kessler had vast experience in the Dutch East Indies, having abandoned his studies at the Delft University at the age of 23 to seek his fortune there. He had become partner in Tiedeman & Van Kerchem, an important business firm, but after financial difficulties in 1888 \"returned broken and shattered in health to Europe, where he sought and found recovery\".\n\nKessler literally built the Royal Dutch almost from scratch, under very difficult circumstances: \"an inclement climate, a hostile jungle and ineradicable lalang (sharp, tough grass), local crews difficult to manage, equipment that did not fit, tropical diseases, operational set-backs such as fires, and absence of adequate geological know-how\", wrote J. Ph. Poley in \"Eroica: The Quest for Oil in Indonesia (1850-1898)\". \"There were also financial, regulatory and procedual hurdles to overcome...The Company survived mainly thanks to the turn-around effected by Jean Baptiste August Kessler.\"\n\nAs Anthony Sampson put it, the company's origins belonged \"to the world of Joseph Conrad rather than Anthony Trollope.\" When Kessler arrived in Sumatra in October 1891, after a two-month sea voyage, he found that the works manager had disappeared in a huff. He discovered that the drilling site was in terrible shape, with essential supplies disappearing or strewn about in the constantly approaching jungle. But he plunged into his work with enormous energy. Due to his ability to quickly solve all kinds of technical problems and his incredible energy, he was accepted by his subordinates as \"Toean Besor\"—the Big Boss—not withstanding what many would describe as a difficult, high-strung personality.\n\nDaniel Yergin, in his history of oil wrote that \"more than any other man\", Kessler was responsible for the survival of the Royal Dutch. He said that \"Kessler was a born leader, with an iron will, and with the ability to concentrate all his own energy and that of those around him on a single objective.\"\n\nQuoting from Kessler's letters to his wife, Yergin illustrates the obstacles faced by the daring oil explorer: \"Half-heartedness, ignorance, indifference, dilapidation, disorder, and vexation are everywhere apparent,\" Kessler reported. \"If things go wrong, my job and my name are gone and perhaps my sacrifices and my extraordinary exertions will be repaid with censure in the bargain. Heaven preserve me from all that misery.\"\n\nIn constant rain, Kessler attempted to connect the drilling site and refinery with a pipeline. Steamkettles were transported through a jungle path on rails, which were removed after the kettles had been pulled up in order to be used for the next stretch. A storm interrupted the supply of rice, resulting in severe food shortages. The drilling produced barely any oil.\n\nKessler, suffering from a fever, worked day and night and was everywhere with improvisations, giving instructions and managing the overall operation. With the greatest difficulty, Kessler and his team were able to get the supplies for a second tower. This one was a \"spouter\" and on Feb. 28, 1892, the first oil flowed through the new pipe to the refinery. The Dutch flag was raised.\n\nKessler returned to the Netherlands, nearly nine months after his \"inspection trip\" began, and focused on trying to secure the necessary capital for the still shaky enterprise. But within two years, oil production had dramatically declined, the new on-site works manager had quit and the company was nearly bankrupt. Kessler again returned to Sumatra to save the infant company. With a small group of workers--\"I demand the nearly impossible but there is no choice; everything rests on my shoulders\"—Kessler again managed to turn things around and tripled oil production within a year. He stayed in Indonesia until 1895, before returning to the Netherlands to focus on the commercial end of the business.\n\nUnder Kessler, the company relaunched its principal product under the brand name \"Crown Oil,\" expanded refining capacity, built a fleet of tankers and constructed several tank farms. In 1897, Royal Dutch increased its capital to 5 million guilders (in 1890, the nominal capital had been 1.3 million guilders) and paid a dividend of 52 percent. He also started nascent joint venture talks with Marcus Samuel, an important trader in oil products based in London under the \"Shell\" name, but a merger did not take place until 1907, with Royal Dutch taking a dominant role by owning 60 percent of the new holding company. Even mighty Standard Oil began to get concerned about the new rival in the business.\n\nDr. F.C. Gerretson, in his four-volume \"History of the Royal Dutch\", heaped praise on Kessler, describing his leadership as necessary for the building of one of the world's major companies: \"He was high-strung and passionate, forceful and impervious, a man of strong prepossessions and often difficult to get along with. He was a born leader of men. Few knew so well how to concentrate all available resources upon a single purpose; how to inspire their fellow workers with their own enthusiasm and energy. Few were capable of such absolute devotion to the task once it has been undertaken\".\n\nAnother book, Joost Jonker's and Jan Luiten van Zanden's \"A History of Royal Dutch Shell\", lauds Kessler's \"unbelievable capacity for hard work...Kessler's sometimes strained behavior emanated from the inner tension between his formal training as a gentleman and his leadership drive, from the necessity to sustain polite discussion whilst craving to go into action\". Kessler was a novice at oil and did not have much technical training, but \"quickly developed a remarkable, intuitive grasp of the industry in all its aspects, founded on his keen sense for figures\".\n\nThe hard work amid difficult surroundings led to Kessler's death one day shy of his 47th birthday. In 1898, oil production in the overworked oil field dropped precipitously. Kessler managed to get a concession for a new oil field from the local Sumatran king and in 1900 he went back to Dutch East Indies one last time. When he arrived he was sick and after only a few days he telegraphed the head office in The Hague that he needed to recuperate and would take the next boat back. He died from a heart attack when his ship made port in Naples, the first stop after the Suez Canal.\n\nKessler, according to Jonker and van Zanten, was \"really Royal Dutch's founding father, the man who created the business and sustained it against the odds, perhaps even against economic common sense. His absolute firmness of purpose had built solid foundations\" before his untimely death from exhaustion in the effort to create the nascent company.\n\nGerretson summed up: \"It was Kessler's audacity, Kessler's faith, and Kessler's indomitable pertinacity in the hour of trial which brought the Company to where it stood when it lost him\".\n\nAfter his death, he was succeeded by a man he had hired as his deputy, Henri Deterding, in 1901. Deterding would later declare, \"As a pioneer in oil, the part played by J.B. August Kessler stands second to none.\"\n\nAugust and his wife Margo had four sons and two daughters. One of their sons, Jean Baptiste August \"Guus\" Kessler Jr., eventually became director-general of Royal Dutch Shell after Deterding resigned in 1936; he also played tennis for the Netherlands in the 1906 Olympics in Athens. Their oldest son, Geldolph Adriaan Kessler, also worked for the Royal Dutch before he left to help form and run the Hoogovens, the Dutch steel company. Dolf Kessler and his brother Boelie Kessler played football for the Dutch national side.\n\n\n\n"}

He is currently CEO and chairman at Bermuda based Endurance Specialty Insurance Ltd, which has been bought by Sompo Holding (Japan ) in March of 2017.\n\nNicknamed \"King of the London Insurance Market\", Charman was described as \"famously strong-willed and opinionated\" by the Financial Times. Charman is ranked in the top 100 people in the global finance industry; inside the top ten richest people in the City of London; and 321st overall in the 2004 Sunday Times Rich List.\n\nIn August 2006 in what is believed to be the largest sum awarded to an English wife in a contested case, Charman was ordered to pay his ex-wife by the High Court of Justice a sum of £48 million. It beat the £30 million awarded to WPP Group chief executive Martin Sorrell's ex-wife in 2005 after their 32-year marriage ended in divorce.\n\nCharman made his fortune in the 1990, during the 1991 Gulf War, offering war risk insurance on a 24-hour basis. Charman was the chief executive officer of Tarquin plc (a joint venture company among Insurance Partners, Harvard University and the Charman Group), the parent company of the Charman Underwriting Agencies at Lloyd's of London. He was also a deputy chairman of the Council of Lloyd's and a member of the Lloyd's Core Management Group and Lloyd's Market Board between 1995 and 1997.\n\nNicknamed \"King of the London Insurance market\", Charman earned the loathing of employees by banning entertainment of clients in company time, and refusing to indulge in long business lunches himself. One critic claimed Charman was so intimidating that colleagues \"half-expect the theme from The Godfather to greet him as he arrives at his office.\" In 2002 Axis settled out of court with a woman who claimed Charman barred her from a meeting, saying: \"We are discussing something we decided when you were having babies.\"\n\nCharman made more money when he sold Tarquin/Charman Underwriting Agencies for £350 million in 1998 to the Bermuda-based ACE International Group, receiving £70.6 million in ACE shares.\n\nCharman was made chief executive officer at ACE Global Markets (the merger of Charman Underwriting and assets of ACE), and in January 2001 was named group president and chief executive officer of Bermuda based ACE International Group, but left the company in March 2001 due to personal differences. He was paid £3,597,241 in lieu of notice, and £500,000 in a one-off pension contribution.\n\nCharman immediately set up Axis Capital, a Bermuda-based reinsurance and insurance business with offices in London, Dublin, Zurich and New York that is listed on the NYSE. The company aimed to cash in on the surge in insurance premiums after the 11 September terrorist attacks. In the financial year 2005 he was paid $7,741,762, and had stock options of $42,027,204 in Axis. Charman has informed the company that he will retire at the end of December 2008, he finally left Axis in 2012. \n\nIn May 2013 he became CEO and Chairman of Endurance Specialty Holdings, another NYSE-listed, Bermuda-based reinsurance and insurance business with offices in Bermuda, London, Singapore, Zurich, New York and other locations. He invested $30'000'000 of his private fortune in Endurance at the beginning of his tenure. \n\nCharman met his ex-wife Beverly in 1969 at school. When they married in 1976, neither had significant resources and the couple lived initially in her parents' home, and then in his mother's home in Strood near Rochester, Kent. The couple eventually moved to Sevenoaks, where they bought a home now worth £2.75 million. The couple have two children: Nicholas (born 1981) and Michael (born 1986).\n\nAs Charman's wealth built, the couple created the Bermuda-based Dragon Trust in 1987, which by 2006 had grown to a value of £65 million. The aim of the trust was according to Charman in his court papers agreed by the couple to preserve wealth for future generations.\n\nAfter failing to secure a new house in England, in November 2003 Charman told his magistrate wife that he was taking up permanent residence in Bermuda and that their marriage was over. He has since set up home in a £2.1 million home in Bermuda, and has started a relationship with another woman.\n\nCharman initially offered his ex-wife their home in Sevenoaks plus £6 million cash, but Mrs Charman, who was represented by Helen Ward, of Manches, argued that the length of the marriage together with her substantial contributions did not justify such a significant departure from equality. Charman eventually offered his wife a package valued at £20 million. However, his wife still believed that the sum was not enough, and appealed the sum through the UK legal process, declaring the assets of the couple in her legal papers as:\n\nMrs Charman also declared that a separate £25 million trust catered for the needs of their sons, and so therefore Dragon Trust was an asset under the control of Charman.\n\nOn 2 August 2006, Mr Justice Coleridge decreed in the High Court of Justice that a fair settlement would involve Charman giving his wife around 37 per cent of his assets, which would involve not only agreeing transfer of assets worth £8 million already under his wife's control, but also an additional one-off lump sum of £40 million. In his written judgement, Mr Justice Coleridge said: \"The husband is genuinely bemused that the wife should regard his £20 million offer as anything other than reasonable, even generous. Her refusal to compromise on his terms has led him to deploy every available point to protect what he regards as his wealth generated entirely by his efforts. In the narrow, old-fashioned sense, that perspective is understandable, if somewhat anachronistic. Nowadays it must attract little sympathy.\"\n\nCharman said: \"This judgement is poor and blatantly discriminatory. By any reasonable standards this is an extraordinary decision. I made a fair and open offer to my wife of £20 million, which would be impossible for any reasonable person to spend in their lifetime.\" Charman later commented that he would be launching an immediate appeal, calling the High Court award \"grotesque and unfair\".\n\nIn review, the amount of 37% was slightly less than the wife received in White v White, the House of Lords case in 2000. That case established the principle that for long marriages the courts should begin their deliberations on how to divide marital assets from the standpoint of a 50:50 split between husband and wife, regardless of who earned the money.\n\nCharman began selling shares in Axis on the NYSE to meet the interim legal arrangements, prior to his appeal. If required to complete full payment, then it is calculated that he will need to sell off his shares in Axis.\n\nCharman and his representatives, Withers, mounted a high-profile media campaign, arguing that White and subsequent decisions are discriminatory towards wealthy husbands. Charman and his legal team have been widely quoted in the British press.\nOn 9 March 2007, Mrs Charman was tied up and robbed of jewellery worth £300,000 at her home, in an incident police believe could have been motivated by the press coverage the case has attracted.\n\nIn a judgment handed down on 24 May 2007, the Court of Appeal dismissed John Charman's appeal against the award of £48 million made to his wife Beverley.\n\nThe Court reviewed the law as it stood at the end of May 2006 following the judgment of the House of Lords in the combined cases of Miller and McFarlane, interpreting and refining the guidance provided by the judgments in those cases.\n\nThe Court has provided clarity in a number of areas connected with the distribution of assets on divorce, particularly in three aspects: \n\nThe Court has also called for a far-reaching review and reform of the law in this area in England and Wales.\n\nHelen Ward of Manches, who has represented Mrs Charman throughout these proceedings, said, \"This is a significant judgment and brings welcome clarity to a number of important aspects of the law relating to the distribution of assets on divorce.\"\n\n\"The Solicitors profession will positively embrace the Court's suggestion for a broad review and reform in this area to create modern law reflecting today's modern society.\"\n\n\"I acknowledge that the sum awarded to me is huge by any standards but the Court of Appeal has decided that it fairly reflects the contributions made by John and me during our twenty eight-year marriage.\n\nThe breakdown of our marriage has been a painful experience for all concerned. Our divorce proceedings started nearly three years ago. It has been a difficult time, not just for me but for our family. I have been particularly concerned for our sons who have had to bear the discussion in public of our lives, our marriage and our divorce.\n\nI am relieved that the appeal is over and I hope that John and I can now concentrate on building our new lives.\"\n\n"}

He was educated at Milford Street School and at St Malachy's College. Joseph Connolly was an ardent nationalist and became a member of the Gaelic League and the Gaelic Athletic Association. As a result of a personality clash with his father he decided not to join the family business and became apprenticed as an engineer with Coombe, Barbour & Coombe Ltd. After a number of months he gave in his notice and secured a new post in the furniture trade of Maguire & Edwards Ltd. He would subsequently establish a furniture business of his own in the city.\n\nConnolly was a co-founder of the first Freedom Club to propagate Sinn Féin's message in 1911. He was a leader of the Irish Volunteers in Belfast between 1914 and 1916. On 31 January 1916 he married his fiancé, Róisín McGavock, who had completed an Arts Degree at Queen's University Belfast, and they set up home together at Divis Drive near Falls Park. They had eight children together. He was in Dublin for Easter 1916 and Eoin MacNeill sent him to deliver his countermanding order to Drogheda, Belfast and other planned areas of Volunteer mobilisation. After the Easter Rising went ahead anyway in Dublin Connolly was arrested in Belfast and was interned in Knutsford Prison and Reading Gaol.\n\nAfter his release he helped re-organise Sinn Féin in Belfast. He was selected as a candidate for the party in the 1918 general election for Mid Antrim. Though unsuccessful he polled 2,791 first preferences and saved his deposit. He served on the Commission of Inquiry into the Resources and Industries of Ireland which had been set up by the First Dáil in 1919. From October 1921 to November 1922 he served as Consul General of the Irish Republic to the United States in New York City. He disposed of his business in Belfast at this time. One of his chief roles was to combat propaganda from Britain unfavourable to Sinn Féin and the IRA. When the Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed he was very cautious in forming an immediate public opinion on it though was nervous about splits in the wider organisation. After the 1922 general election, and the arrival of Professor Timothy Smiddy as an accredited Ambassador in Washington, he was informed that he no longer held any recognition in the eyes of the US Government and so he returned home to Ireland. His family had at this time moved to Dublin and they set up home at Harold's Cross, never returning to Belfast. The Irish Civil War had then commenced and he formally tendered his resignation to the Free State Government.\n\nIn February 1923, he joined the National Land Bank for some months and was persuaded to assist Sinn Féin with the 1923 general election. For economic reasons he retreated from politics and established a business in New York and spent some months there each year which he operated from 1923 to 1929. He was aware of political developments in Ireland, however, and would join Fianna Fáil in 1926. In 1928 Connolly was elected a member of the Free State Seanad for nine years and would serve until the Seanad's abolition in 1936. He was the leader of the Fianna Fáil delegation and the Leader of the Opposition. After the 1932 general election Éamon de Valera appointed him as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in his government and he became the first person to be a Minister while not a member of Dáil Éireann. (He was the only member of the Free State Seanad to serve as a minister, but two members of it successor Seanad Éireann served as ministers: Seán Moylan in 1957, and James Dooge in 1981–82.)\n\nAs a minister, he accompanied de Valera to Geneva and the League of Nations where he attended many sessions. It was at this time that de Valera had voiced his concerns for the future of the League. After the 1933 general election he was appointed as Minister for Lands and Fisheries and was sent on a special mission by de Valera to the USA to repay the Republican bonds which had been bought in the USA during the Irish War of Independence. He represented the Government and spoke at the World Economic Conference in London that year but the Conference was not a success partly because the Economic War was in progress between Ireland and the United Kingdom. His chief responsibility was overseeing the work of the Land Commission whose purpose was to re-distribute land to tenants. He transferred his Department of Fisheries to James Ryan, the then Minister for Agriculture, in exchange for the Department of Forestry and oversaw increased planting throughout the state. He ceased being a Minister with the abolition of the Seanad.\n\nFrom 1936 until 1950 he served as Chairman of the Office of Public Works (OPW), initially focusing on arterial drainage. In September 1939 he was appointed Controller of Censorship by de Valera. He acted in this role for two years until September 1941 serving under his former Cabinet colleague, Frank Aiken. He was based at Upper Yard, Dublin Castle and would in time be the subject of criticism from Opposition politicians and the press as lacking the necessary objectivity, discretion, tact and judgment for such a position. Similar criticism would also be levelled at Aiken. Connolly argued for a strict censorship to prevent any comment that favoured either the British or German forces. This power extended to the press and to the reporting of Dáil speeches. Connolly was highly zealous at his work and his chief opposition came from \"The Irish Times\" newspaper and its editor, R. M. Smyllie, and the Fine Gael TD, James Dillon who both viewed Connolly as an Anglophobe.\n\nHe resumed his work in the OPW in 1941 and retired from the Civil Service on 19 January 1950 when he was sixty-five. He wrote a number of plays including \"The Mine Land\" and \"Master of the House.\" Connolly also served as a director of \"The Irish Press\" newspaper for a time. He died in 1961, one day before his seventy-sixth birthday.\n"}

During his first year with RCBC he steered the bank to a 56% growth in its net income at Php 3.21 billion, the steepest profit growth among the Philippines' top 10 banks. In 2009 RCBC recorded a 54% increase in its net income at Php3.33 billion. This was followed by net incomes of Php4.28 billion in 2010, Php5.9 billion in 2011, and peaking at Php5.94 billion in 2012.\n\nIt was also during his tenure as president that the bank was able to secure several equity and debt capital raisings, including Cathay Life Insurance Co.

But even after being cleared by the bank's independent investigation, Tan still chose to resign as head of RCBC on May 6, 2016 to take \"full moral responsibility\" for the incident. He was also subsequently cleared by all other investigating government agencies.\n\nTan filed civil and criminal cases against the former RCBC bank manager at the center of the controversy for libel and perjury after she dragged his name into the case. The manager admitted to lying in her statements given to the committee conducting an investigation in the Philippine Senate.\n\nSubsequent investigations into the hacking, which are being conducted by the Federal prosecutors in the United States, have revealed that the government of North Korea may have possibly had a role in the theft of the US$81 Million\n. Some or all of the stolen funds may have found its way to North Korea. The FBI is examining the totalitarian state’s link to the hack, according to two officials with direct knowledge of the investigation. US National Security Agency Deputy Director Rick Ledgett was also quoted as saying that, “If that linkage from the Sony actors to the Bangladeshi bank actors is accurate — that means that a nation state is robbing banks.\"\n\nThe U.S. has charged a North Korean computer programmer with the 2016 cyber-heist of Bangladesh's central bank, among other celebrated global hacking attacks, alleging they were carried out on behalf of the regime in Pyongyang. The hacks also included the WannaCry 2.0 virus, the 2014 Sony Pictures attack. The hack of the central bank of Bangladesh saw at least $81 million stolen and transferred between a number of accounts in the Philippines and elsewhere, rendering most of it unrecoverable.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2007, Tan was responsible for the business growth and leadership of Sun Life Financial in the Philippines. This consisted of three businesses: insurance, pre-need and mutual funds.\n\nThe insurance company was the second largest in the Philippines in 2005 with total assets in excess of Php60 billion, with a more than 2,300 strong agency force, and 53 branches and sales offices nationwide. By year-end 2006, Sun Life pre-need leapt to the number one position (from 6th), its mutual funds business overtook its main competitor, and its life insurance unit remained a strong second. That same year he was awarded the Insurance CEO (CEO EXCEL Awards) of the year by IABC/Phils.\n\nAt 40 years old, Tan became the youngest president in the bank's history. While serving as President and CEO of the Philippine National Bank, Tan was responsible for managing the fourth largest private bank in the Philippines with 324 domestic branches and 99 overseas offices with total assets in excess of Php 200 billion.\n\nTan joined the PNB on April 10, 2002 upon the invitation of its two major shareholders, namely, the government-owned Philippine Deposit Insurance Corp. (PDIC) and the Lucio Tan Group. At that time, the PDIC had just infused P7.8 billion in equity, in the form of preferred shares in the bank, in line with its five-year rehabilitation program. Tan was given the \"principal mandate to lead the five-year rehabilitation efforts and turn around the financial performance from losses to profits.\" He is credited with the adoption of the \"good bank-bad bank\" strategy, which resulted in the early recovery of government funds, including premium in just the third year of the five-year rehabilitation prorgram. During his term as president of PNB, Tan was able to steer the bank to its first profitability in 6 years with Php 168 million net income in 2003 versus P2 billion projected loss, reversing Php 33 billion losses in 5 years.\n\nLorenzo Tan is known in the banking industry as \"Mr. Turnaround\" for his knack of improving the economic performances of the various corporations he has headed. When he was appointed president and chief executive officer of Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. (RCBC) on February 1, 2007, the institution was under capitalized and its asset quality was poor.\n\nJust one year later, following some structural, operational and capital changes, RCBC was able to report a 56% jump in unaudited net income to P3.21 billion (US$77.2 million); the steepest profit growth among the country's top 10 banks for that year. Before taking charge at RCBC, Tan was at the helm of Sun Life of Canada (Philippines) for 18 months, during which time he took the company to higher levels in insurance, the pre-need industry and mutual funds.\n\nPrior to that, he was able to reverse the fortunes of the formerly state-owned Philippine National Bank (PNB). One year under Tan's watch, PNB was able to go from five straight years of losses to enter the black in 2003. It then doubled net income in 2004 and was ready for privatization the following year, two years ahead of schedule.\n\nLorenzo V. Tan is the recipient of numerous awards and recognitions, including being named one of the Ten Outstanding Young Men (TOYM) for Banking in 1999.\n\nHe has also been consistently among the top taxpayers in the Philippines, having made the list in 2012, 2013, and 2015.\n\nIn 2014 Tan was named by Megaworld as among the Philippines Top 25 Visionaries.\n\nIn 2015 Tan was a recipient of the prestigious PeopleAsia \"People of the Year\" award. He was again honored by the magazine in 2016 when he was included in their \"16 men who matter\" in the Philippines list.\n\nHe received a La Sallian Achievement Award in 2011 from the De La Salle University, which is given to alumni who have \"achieved either industrial, managerial, professional, vocational, or public service distinction or series of distinction.\"\n"}

The couple later divorced.\n\nIn June 1971, Elizalde claimed discovery to a primitive tribe untouched by civilization, who lived in caves and survived by hunting and gathering. The \"Tasadays\" were found in a forest in South Cotabato, Mindanao. The story gained traction in international media, some complimenting him as \"a visionary idealist who cared more about the hard-pressed national minorities than about his family fortune\". However, all visits from foreign media and scholars were supervised by the Presidential Assistance on National Minorities (PANAMIN) which was led by Elizalde himself. Independent anthropologists were prohibited to enter the Tasaday reservation area, thus at the time there was no scholarly paper published on the Tasaday. It was only after the Marcos downfall that a Swiss journalist, Oswald Iten, entered the area and found the so-called Paleolithic tribe dressed in T-shirts and living in huts. Many other local and foreign anthropologists decried Elizalde's claims, calling it an elaborate hoax.\n\nElizalde was regarded as a crony of former President and dictator Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nHe and his brother Fred J. Elizalde became involved in many businesses such as mining, abaca farming, sugar centrals, tin plate manufacturing, paints, foods, distillery, real estate, rural banking, and agri-business. They both came into conflict with many of his laborers due to exploitation of sugar workers, refusing to pay livable wages and bonuses, and oppression of cultural minorities. Elizalde was the chief executive of several steel companies, which were favored and accommodated by the Marcos regime in funding, and guarantee of lucrative markets. He monopolized sales of tin plates, and raised prices at will, which rippled in the market with price increases. In one instance, Elizalde raised the price for tin plates by 17% in 1980, and threatened to increase it with another 7.5% unless the government continued to charge tax on imported raw materials.\n\nElizalde died on May 3, 1997.

It is based on the creation of a lunar colony or city. Anarchy Enterprises described it as the \"first 3-D Sim game ever\", and noted that it has similarities to SimCity (which at the time was 2-dimensional).\n\nMoon Tycoon has three campaigns to play through, each with its own story-line and placed around the year 2021.\n\nCampaign 1: Earth is in a global energy crisis, and the only thing that can stop it is a precious ore called Helium 3 that can only be found on the moon.\n\nCampaign 2: The energy crisis is over, but competition begins to heat up as corporations battle for lunar domination as space borne epidemics, discontent over living conditions and space disasters become more frequent.\n\nCampaign 3: Mankind makes yet another leap as it begins the next stage of space exploration: the colonization of the asteroid belt beyond Mars.\n\nEach campaign has ten levels to play through each with varied levels of difficulty. All three campaigns make up a larger story, so they can only be played in order and starting with the first.\nThere is also a sandbox mode; where you can set the starting money, terrain type, ore quantity and average building life; it also lets you select the moon or asteroid.\n\nThe game is played on the Play Area, on which completed and under-construction structures are displayed. Players also use this screen to begin construction of buildings and alter the terrain. The play area is raised up from the surrounding view and can also have a grid.\n\nTo the right of the Play Area is the Building Menus, Colony Management, Disasters, and Options.\n\nThe building menu display the various types of structures available for construction. These buildings are divided into different categories: Housing and Medical, Tourism, Research, Rewards (earned by different objectives), utilities, and Industry.\n\nThe spiritual sequel, \"Deep Sea Tycoon\", often confused with \"Atlantis Underwater Tycoon\", is a 2003 video game developed by Anarchy Enterprises and published by Unique Entertainment. This game involves you building an underwater city in 3D. It has a sequel, \"Deep Sea Tycoon 2\", developed by Pixel after Pixel.\n\nThe gameplay of \"Deep Sea Tycoon\" involves choosing one of 24 different characters and creating an underwater city filled with different buildings and features, from Mermaid Palaces to Seafood Restaurants. Through the character they choose and the choices they make in their city, the player can become a ruthless oil-tycoon, or something similar, or an environmentalist.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to Moon Tycoon. The player creates buildings on a flat piece of land, that must be connected to other buildings by a \"tunnel\". The only major differences is the scenario, and the types of buildings each game uses.\n\n\"Deep Sea Tycoon 2\" has been reviewed by X-Play, being given a 1 out of 5. Being noted for being boring by having \"ridiculously easy challenges\" and simple challenges of only having to \"click my mouse button twice\". As a final note in their review, Adam Sessler noted that \"Game Tycoon\" was more entertaining than \"Deep Sea Tycoon 2\".\n\n"}
{"id": "392340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=392340", "title": "New Jersey Generals", "text": "New Jersey Generals\n\nThe New Jersey Generals were a franchise of the United States Football League (USFL) established in 1982 to begin play in the spring and summer of 1983. The team played three seasons from 1983 to 1985, winning 31 regular-season games and losing 25 while going 0–2 in postseason competition. Home games were played at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, which was called The Meadowlands for Generals games.\n\nTeam colors were scarlet, white, royal blue and sunflower gold. The primary logo was a gold five-star general wreath. Team helmets were solid scarlet with the logo decal on each side and a white face-mask. Home uniforms featured red jerseys with white numbers trimmed in royal blue, with numbers on the sleeves and no striping; pants were white with a single wide red stripe trimmed in blue down the sides from hip to knee. Road jerseys were white with red numbers trimmed in blue. The team was the second in the New York metropolitan area to be known as \"Generals,\" since there was a professional soccer team in the late 1960s known as the New York Generals.\n\nFrom the beginning, USFL founder David Dixon placed a premium on putting a team in the New York area. Initially, real estate magnate and future U. S. president Donald Trump was tapped to own the team. However, he backed out after paying an initial installment on the franchise fee, hoping instead to buy the struggling Baltimore Colts of the NFL. Needing a credible owner with the means to front a team in the nation's biggest market, Dixon persuaded Oklahoma oil magnate J. Walter Duncan to step in. Duncan had originally been slated to own the USFL's Chicago franchise, as he'd grown up in Chicago. However, he readily agreed to shift to New York.\n\nDuncan took on former New England Patriots coach Chuck Fairbanks as a minority partner; Duncan knew Fairbanks from his days as head coach at the University of Oklahoma. Fairbanks also served as general manager and head coach. They initially had an uphill battle to get a lease at Giants Stadium, but were able to obtain one on condition that they brand their team as \"New Jersey\" rather than \"New York.\" They named the team the \"Generals\" after the large number of generals based in New Jersey during the Revolutionary War.\n\nThe team made a big splash by signing Heisman Trophy-winning underclassman Herschel Walker, a running back from the University of Georgia. While the USFL had followed the NFL's lead in banning underclassmen from playing, league officials were certain that this rule would never withstand a court challenge. In an even more ominous development, Walker did not sign a standard player contract. Rather, he agreed to a three-year personal-services contract with Duncan. The contract was valued at $4.2 million—more than double the USFL's salary cap of $1.8 million. Nonetheless, the other owners knew having the incumbent Heisman winner in their fold would lend the USFL instant credibility, and allowed the contract to stand. \n\nDespite the signing of Walker, who rushed for 1,812 yards and 17 touchdowns, the Generals finished their inaugural season with a 6–12 record. This was largely due to a porous defense which gave up the third-most points in the league (437).\n\nAt 66 years old, Duncan soon tired of flying 2,000 miles from Oklahoma to New York to see his team play. He was not willing to be an absentee owner, and decided to sell to a local buyer. After the 1983 season, he found one in Trump, who had initially angled for the franchise in 1982 before backing out. \n\nTrump tried to lure legendary coach Don Shula from the Miami Dolphins. Once Shula declined, the Generals hired former New York Jets head coach Walt Michaels. \n\nThe Generals responded to their poor 1983 showing with an influx of veteran NFL talent for 1984, including wide receiver Tom McConnaughey, quarterback Brian Sipe, defensive back Gary Barbaro, and linebackers Jim LeClair and Bobby Leopold. Both Walker and fullback Maurice Carthon rushed for over 1,000 yards (Walker 1,339; Carthon 1,042) as the Generals went 14–4, defeating the eventual champion Philadelphia Stars twice for that franchise's only two losses of the season. The Stars defeated the Generals 28–7 in a first round playoff game.\n\nThe 1985 season saw the heralded signing of Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Doug Flutie of Boston College. Despite Flutie's inexperience, the Generals traded Sipe to the Jacksonville Bulls to ensure Flutie would start. Flutie struggled at times but played well overall until he suffered a broken collarbone against the Memphis Showboats in the season's 15th game and did not play again. The 1985 Generals finished 11–7 behind Walker's pro-football record 2,411 rushing yards but lost again to the Stars (transplanted to Baltimore) in the first round of the playoffs, 20–17.\n\nAlmost from the moment Trump bought the Generals, he sought to use them as a vehicle to get an NFL team. To this end, he began advocating moving the USFL from a spring schedule to a fall schedule, directly opposite NFL. His long-term plans called for moving the Generals across the Hudson River to New York, which had not had a team play within its borders since the Jets moved from Shea Stadium in Queens to the Meadowlands. He intended to have the Generals play at Shea until the construction of a new 80,000-seat \"Trump Stadium\" in Manhattan.\n\nIn 1984, he convinced most of his fellow owners to move to a fall schedule in 1986. Trump contended that if the USFL were to hold its own against the NFL, it would eventually force a merger with the more established league—in which the owners of any USFL teams included in a merger would see their investment more than double.\n\nThe Generals acquired the assets of one of the teams displaced by the vote to move to the fall, the Houston Gamblers, during the extended offseason. This was widely reported as a merger, since the Generals inherited all of the Gamblers' player contracts–including those of quarterback Jim Kelly and wide receiver Ricky Sanders. Michaels was fired, replaced with former Gamblers coach Jack Pardee, who planned to bring Kelly and the Gamblers' high-powered run and shoot offense with him. Fans immediately dubbed the Kelly-Walker led Generals as the USFL's \"Dream Team.\" \n\nHowever, the revamped Generals never played a down. The 1986 season was cancelled after the USFL won a minimal verdict in an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL; the league folded soon afterward.\n\nNumerous Generals players, including Flutie, Walker and center Kent Hull went on to productive NFL careers. Flutie also starred in the Canadian Football League; Hull (with Gambler quarterback Kelly) played in four Super Bowls with the Buffalo Bills, and Flutie was the last quarterback to have led the Bills to the NFL playoffs until the 2017 season.\n\n\n!Totals || 31 || 25 || 0\n"}

The Building Bridges program developed partnerships with fellow LGBT organizations around the Bay Area. Berry ran the program and built coalitions as a single-person staff working out of the Pacific Center in Berkeley, California, and by September 1997 she moved into the United Way Bay Area (UWBA) offices in San Francisco.\n\nBy 1998, three LGBT workplace organizations merged in an effort to effectively collaborate on their common mission of creating safe and affirming workplaces for LGBT individuals—called the Pride Collaborative. These organizations included Building Bridges, A Group of Groups (AGOG), and Progress.\n\nIn 1999 The Pride Collaborative merged with COLLEAGUES, a national organization that sponsored the annual Out & Equal Conference aimed at human resource professionals and LGBT employees, to form Out & Equal Workplace Advocates, and the current organizational structure was born. That same year, Progress's Leadership Summit and COLLEAGUES' Out & Equal Conference combined resources to produce the annual Out & Equal Workplace Summit, one of the keystone programs of the organization.\n\nIn January 2004, after years of being supported by the United Way of the Bay Area, Out & Equal Workplace Advocates became an independent 501 [c] 3 organization. Out & Equal is headquartered in San Francisco's Financial District and in 2015 announced the opening of a second office in Washington, DC.\n\nOut & Equal annually holds a training and networking event called the Out & Equal Workplace Summit in rotating locations around the United States. The Workplace Summit hosts thousands of LGBT employees, human resource professionals and organizational representatives each year for a few days of training and networking. The Workplace Summit includes an award ceremony aimed at recognizing leaders in LGBT workplace equality called The Outies.\n\nOut & Equal's Workplace Summit is considered to be appropriate for federal training in compliance with 5 U.S.C. Chapter 41. As proclaimed by Human Resources Director John Berry on August 6, 2010, the Out & Equal Workplace Summit is open to all federal employees.\nIn 2012 Out & Equal held their first international Summit in London. This dynamic event brought together people from around the world to consider ways to build greater equality in the workplace for LGBT people and allies. Attendees came together to share best practices, engage with colleagues from around the world, and strengthen the diversity of global workplaces. Tennis champion Martina Navratilova, IBM Europe Chairman Harry van Dorenmalen, and organizational consultant John Amaechi were among the speakers at the Global LGBT Workplace Summit. The conference featured 24 workshops covering a broad range of topics focused on LGBT workplace issues around the world.\n\nThe Executive Forum is an annual meeting of executive leaders in a multi-day conference to \"learn from one another and share best practices.\" The first Executive Forum was held in 2008 in San Francisco but have been held in countries all over the US.\n\nThe Momentum Gala is Out & Equal's annual celebration and gala dinner held in San Francisco which honors prominent activists in the LGBT movement, organizations dedicated to diversity and inclusion in their workplace, and features LGBT entertainers and inspirational speakers.\n\nOut & Equal offers diversity training, educational resources and consulting services to senior management, human resource professionals, employee resource groups and individual employees to promote LGBT workplace equality.

These Regional Affiliates provide knowledge, training and networking to local LGBT professionals.\n\nOut & Equal's LGBTCareerLink was launched in November 2008 and serves as a job search engine and professional networking website, designed to expand members' career-building networks by connecting them to other job seekers as well as employment recruiters. LGBTCareerLink allows users to upload job ads, articles and tips, as well as other career-building resources .\n\nAs a workplace equality advocacy organization, Out & Equal has publicly supported the passage of ENDA . Out & Equal has issued public statements urging constituents to contact their United States House Representatives to proceed with the passage of ENDA. During San Francisco Pride Parades, Out & Equal has provided signage to parade participants displaying support for ENDA.\n\nConsidering the military a workplace, Out & Equal Workplace Advocates took an early stance against Don't Ask, Don't Tell policies. In February 2008, Selisse Berry wrote in an open letter to Congress and Nancy Pelosi stating, \"We believe that in these times of international crisis (and at all times), the military has a duty to recruit and retain the most qualified people, foster genuine teamwork, and set an example that ALL American citizens matter. We believe that Congress has a moral obligation to repeal policies that have prevented the military from achieving these goals.\"\n\nLeading up the 2015 SCOTUS ruling in \"Obergefell v. Hodges\" that state-level bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional, Out & Equal Workplace Advocates was one of 379 employer organizations that signed on to an \"amicus curiae\" brief which urged the High Court to consider the burdens imposed on both employers and employees by a fractured legal landscape with no uniform rule on same-sex marriage.\n\nOut & Equal's \"Business Case for Marriage Equality\" was penned in 2010 and remains a critical tenant of the organization's overall work.\n\nIn light of national outcry for immigration reform, Out & Equal joined a coalition of LGBT organizations around the United States in a public statement to support the Uniting American Families Act (UAFA) which protects the rights of same-sex couples during the immigration process into the United States. In a partnership with organizations including The Council for Global Equality and Human Rights Watch, Out & Equal publicly stated that, \"An estimated 17,000 young children are being raised by LGBT parents in binational families and those children face the very real possibility of losing a parent, or leaving the only country they have ever called home.\"\n\nIn response to public backlash to Target Corporation's large political donation to anti-gay Republican politician Tom Emmer, Target Corporation publicly called upon the Corporation's continued financial sponsorship of Out & Equal's Workplace Summit. Target CEO Gregg Steinhafel emphasized Target's relationship with Out & Equal in order to demonstrate the company's commitment to LGBT Workplace equality.\n\nStanford University lists Out & Equal as the leading organization for LGBT graduates to turn to for job placement advice.\n\nIn 2010, Out & Equal launched a series of editorials called \"Communities in Common\" written by diverse members of the LGBT community in order to recognize and celebrate the roles of other communities within the struggle for equality.\n\nOn October 8, 2010 Out & Equal was recognized by GLSEN for outstanding leadership in LGBT rights at the GLSEN Respect Awards in Los Angeles, California.\n\nIn 2016, Selisse Berry, Founder of Out & Equal, was presented the Bonham Centre Award from The Mark S.

His introduction to High End audio came with his work for exclusive distributors of well known Hifi brands in the mid 70’s. In his spare time Trunz helped in organizing a series of Jazz concerts at the Aula in Baden (Switzerland) where he met artists like Ian Carr, Klaus Doldinger, Alphonse Mouzon and Abdullah Ibrahim, Trunz gained retail experience by building up the High End Hifi section of a shop in wealthy Lachen on the Lake of Zurich. It was here in 1979 when he first met John Bowers who hired him as an independent marketing and product consultant. In 1981 Trunz moved to England where he took over the Marketing of B&W Loudspeakers turning the ailing manufacturer into a profit making and fast expanding export orientated loudspeaker company.\n\nAfter John Bowers premature departure in December 1986 Robert Trunz became majority shareholder and president of B&W Loudspeakers. This was also the time when he conceptualized and founded the record label B&W Music which later became MELT 2000. An experienced organiser of people, musicians and events, Trunz is passionate about indigenous (jazz, world, African) music and has worked with different artists from around the world. Many visits to South Africa has seen him discovering new talent like the late Moses Taiwa Molelekwa and producing for seasoned artists like Pops Mohammad, Busi Mhlongo, Airto Moreira, Flora Purim, Madala Kunene, Brice Wassy, Mabi Gabriel Thobejane, Thabang Tabane, Frank Magongwa, Gontse Makhene, Bafana Nhlapo, Amampondo and Sipho Gumede to name a few. telling\n\n1987 Robert Trunz collaborated with Claude Nobs launching the \"B&W Platinum Music Club\" at the Montreux Jazz Festival that later became the Q (Quincy Jones) and expanded into the Miles Davis Hall.

Miller then served in the Army and played professional football before he was knocked unconscious during a game—one where Walt Disney was in attendance.\n\n\"My father-in-law saw me play in two football games when I was with the Los Angeles Rams. In one of them, I caught a pass and Dick 'Night Train' Lane let me have it from the rear. His forearm came across my nose and knocked me unconscious. I woke up in about the third quarter. At the end of the season, Walt came up to me and said, 'You know, I don't want to be the father to your children. You're going to die out there. How about coming to work with me?' I did and it was a wise decision on my part. I'm really very proud of having been a professional athlete. I think it teaches you to be competitive, to accept challenges and to see things through. I realize the image some people have of jocks, but I think that certainly has changed over the years,\" Miller told entertainment reporter Dale Pollock in August 1984.\n\nMiller initially worked at Walt Disney Productions for a few months in 1954 as a liaison between WED Enterprises and Disneyland before he was drafted into the army later that year. When he came home from the army, he played professional football, however later he was prompted by Disney to return to work for him.\n\nDisney sponsored his son-in-law and got him into the Screen Director's Guild and Miller worked as a second assistant on \"Old Yeller\" (1957). He soon rose up the ranks to a variety of producer positions and also directed some of Disney lead-ins for the popular weekly Disney television series.\n\nIn 1958, Clint Walker walked out of the popular Warner Bros. television Western \"Cheyenne\" for a variety of reasons. Bill Orr, who was Jack L. Warner's son-in-law, called in Miller to audition as Walker's replacement, and was impressed enough to schedule a screen test. Disney stepped in and told Miller to forget acting, that Disney was grooming him for the position of producer. Walker resolved his differences with Warner Bros. and returned to the show in 1959. As a result, Miller never attempted acting again.\n\nInstead, Miller spent his time in the film division and his co-producer credits appear on such Disney films as \"Son of Flubber\", \"Summer Magic\", and \"That Darn Cat!\". His first movie with full producer credit was \"Never a Dull Moment\" (1968).\n\nMiller was credited as producer on films including \"Tron\", \"Pete's Dragon\", \"Escape to Witch Mountain\", and \"The Black Cauldron\".\n\nMiller became president of Walt Disney Productions in 1978 and CEO in 1983. Miller pushed the Company to expand and explore, creating the Touchstone label and the Disney Channel in 1983. Much like Walt before him, Miller was an innovator—experimenting in early computer animation with films, such as \"Tron\" (1982); funding an upstart Tim Burton for stop-motion animation shorts \"Vincent\" (1982) and \"Frankenweenie\" (1984); and planting the seeds for future projects, including \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" (1988).\n\nUnder his leadership, Disney became the target of corporate raiders and takeover attempts, and many influential shareholders criticized Miller's leadership. In 1984, fellow Disney family member Roy E. Disney (son of Walt Disney's brother Roy), Stanley Gold, and shareholder Sid Bass ousted Miller in favor of a trio of non-Disney executives, Michael Eisner, Frank Wells and Jeffrey Katzenberg.\n\nAfter Miller left The Walt Disney Company in 1984, he and Diane resettled in Napa Valley, which became their permanent home. Ron and Diane established Silverado Vineyards in 1981, four years after the first acreage was purchased near the small town of Yountville, California. The couple has championed environmental efforts in wine making, including helping to restore local riverbanks and creek beds and adopting solar power and hybrid-engine technology in the wine industry.\n\nEmmy Awards \n\n\n"}

It may be converted to constant units by multiplying by a price index to adjust for changes in prices over time and changes in quality of the goods and services produced.\nA sectoral output measure is conceptually different from measures of gross output or value-added output. Gross output for the sector consists of sales, or receipts, and other operating income, plus commodity taxes and changes in inventories. Value-added measures exclude the value of intermediate inputs such as material, energy, and services, whether from the same industry or others. Thus gross output is larger than sectoral output which is larger than value-added output.\nSectoral output is the measure of output used in \"KLEMS\" multifactor measures of productivity, which attempt to account for all direct inputs to production: capital services (K), labor services (L), energy (E), materials purchased (M), and services purchased (S)\nWhen calculating labor productivity, a value-added measure of output should be used to avoid counting other inputs (like purchased materials) as if they were created by the labor and capital applied within the sector.\nThe definition of the sectoral output has been attributed to Frank M. Gollop.\n\n\n"}

It features a map demarcating Skid Row's legally recognized boundaries alongside an official-looking sign, replete with city seal, reading \"Skid Row City Limit, Population: Too Many.\" This is the initial installation of a mural project that will eventually cover the whole wall on the San Julian block north of 6th Street.\n\nInstalled in compliance with the city's mural ordinance, the project was organized by Skid Row activist General Jeff Page with local street art crew Winston Death Squad. It was carried out solely with the labor of Skid Row citizens and without the aid of any service organizations. The piece represents a reaction to the growing practice among commercial groups of referring to historic areas of Skid Row with alternative designations. It emphasizes Skid Row's historic and official significance with a citation of the 2006 Jones v. City of Los Angeles court decision that specifies Skid Row's physical boundaries as between Main and Alameda streets to the west and east, and Third and Seventh streets to the north and south. \n\nLos Angeles City Councilman José Huizar's office has hailed the mural, saying, \"It's community pride on the one hand, it's cleverly done and it creates conversation and debate, which often great public art does.\" In its annual street art review, LA Weekly named the Skid Row City Limits mural the city's best new street art mural of 2014. \n"}

He served during World War II in the Pacific with the 380th Bomb Group of the United States Army Air Corps in the Pacific Theater. Hunt flew on the first bomber from the 380th to land in Japan, and flew on a B-24 Liberator representing the 380th during a flyover of Tokyo Bay to mark the Japanese surrender on the USS \"Missouri\".\n\nHunt attended the University of Arkansas, where he studied chemical engineering, but at his uncle Herbert's suggestion, he worked for the family oil interests in Wyoming, North Dakota, and in Montana's Williston Basin. He was ultimately assigned to manage the Hunt family operations in Louisiana.\n\nHunt played a major role in the negotiations of the June 2008 acquisition of Hunt Petroleum by Fort Worth, Texas-based XTO Energy for $4.186 billion.

Vanpools have a lower operating and capital cost than most transit vehicles in the United States, but due to their relatively low capacity, vanpools often require subsidies comparable to conventional bus service. \n\nVehicles may be provided by individuals, individuals in cooperation with various public and private support programs, through a program operated by or on behalf of an element of government, or a program operated by or on behalf of an employer.\n\nThe key concept is that people share the ride from home or one or more common meeting locations and travel together to a common destination or work center. \n\nA number of programs exist (within the United States) to help lower the cost of that shared ride to the end user. Among these are traditional funding available to public agencies, public-private partnerships, and the Best Work Places for Commuters (Commuter Choice Programs). A tax benefit is available under 26 U.S.C. §132(f) Qualified Transportation Fringe Benefit allowances. These public transportation programs seek to reduce the number of cars on the road (with all the attendant environmental benefits). \n\nAdditional benefits include:\n\nIn many cases, an employer may elect to subsidize the cost of the vanpool and the vehicles' maintenance. In some cases, the vehicles are provided and maintained by the municipality; in others in partnership with or by a third-party provider. For example, UCLA operates an extensive network of vans, in which faculty, staff and students are eligible for discounted rates, although anyone commuting to the Westwood area is allowed to participate, with drivers receiving the highest discounts. The vans are centrally maintained, fueled, and cleaned.\n\nThe King County Metro Vanpool Program is a successful demand responsive transport program in the Puget Sound area, specifically in King County, Washington. Another successful program is operated by Pace in Illinois.\n\nThe oldest multi-employer vanpool program in the country is in Treasure Valley, Idaho. For over 30 years Ada County Highway District’s Commuteride Vanpools have been crisscrossing the Valley helping commuters go to and from work, with their numerous vanpool routes traveling throughout the Treasure Valley. The Vanpools also service the Military at Gowen Field and Mountain Home Air Force Base (MHAFB) with multiple routes to and from Ada and Canyon County. ACHD Commuteride serves the cities, Boise, Meridian, Kuna, Garden City, Eagle and Star as well as Ada County.\n\nPrivate firms operate vanpools for individuals, as well as in cooperation with employers or under contract.\n\n"}

In addition, he has more than 100,000 compact discs.\n\nFreitas was born around 1955, and acquired the nickname \"Zero\" at school. When he was a child, his father bought a hi-fi stereo that came with 200 albums, thus kindling Freitas's interest in the area. The collection was damaged in a flood and Freitas later recreated it. His mother, who had a collection of 400–500 records, also influenced Freitas. The first record he bought was \"Canta para a Juventude\" by Roberto Carlos, which he acquired around December 1964 or January 1965. By the time Freitas left high school he had 3,000 records. Freitas studied music composition at college then took over the family transport business which ran buses in the city of São Paulo. By the time he was 30, Freitas had acquired about 25–30,000 records.\n\nUntil recently, most of Freitas's buying was anonymous. He placed adverts in \"Billboard\" magazine reading \"RECORD COLLECTIONS. We BUY any record collection. Any style of music. We pay HIGHER prices than anyone else.\" and used agents to act on his behalf. He bought the remaining stock of 200,000 records from Colony Records in New York's Times Square after the store's 2012 closure and bought the stock of the Rio de Janeiro's Modern Sound store around the same time. Around 2013 he bought the collection of Murray Gershenz, the former proprietor of the Music Man Murray record shop in Los Angeles. Also in 2013, Freitas bought the collection of Paul Mawhinney of Record-Rama, once itself thought to be the largest in the world. The collection of around three million records took eight semitrailers to move.\n\nThe extent of Freitas's collection was first revealed to the world after details were published in an article in \"The New York Times Magazine\" in August 2014. At that time he was estimated to have \"several million\" records. By March 2015, his collection was estimated at six million, making his the largest record collection in existence. Freitas was unable to explain why he continues to acquire so many records, saying \"I’ve gone to therapy for 40 years to try to explain this to myself\". He collects 33, 45 and 78 rpm records of any style of music or speech. The records are cleaned and cataloged by a team of assistants that he has recruited but he is acquiring new material faster than they can work and only 250,000 records have been processed so far. He keeps 100,000 records at home. The collection includes many rareties such as \"Heartache Souvenirs\"/\"Chicken Shack,\" by William Powell but it also includes up to 30% duplication. Those duplicates are now beginning to be sold off. Ten thousand Brazilian records were given to the ARChive of Contemporary Music where they form the Zero Freitas Brazilian Music Collection.\n\nAs Freitas has become well known, collectors have begun to offer him their collections. In October 2014 alone he acquired one million records from another collector for 200,000 reais. In 2015, Terence McEwan of the San Francisco Opera gave Freitas 6,500 classical LPs. Freitas continues to maintain agents around the world, including in Mexico, New York and Nigeria. These enable him to buy a diverse range of material such as the collection of the late Bob Hope and the 100,000 albums of Cuban music he has acquired. His staff joke that the island of Cuba must be rising due to the weight of material that Freitas has removed.\n\nFreitas is building a warehouse to store his collection which he plans to call the Emporium Musical.\n\nIn addition to transport, Freitas runs a business providing audio-visual systems for concerts and other public events.\n\n\n"}
