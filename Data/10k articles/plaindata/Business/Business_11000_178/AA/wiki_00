{"id": "4856806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4856806", "title": "101 California Street shooting", "text": "101 California Street shooting\n\nThe 101 California Street Shooting was a mass shooting on July 1, 1993, in San Francisco, California. The killings sparked a number of legal and legislative actions that were precursors to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, H.R.3355, 103rd Congress. The Act took effect in 1994 and expired in September 2004 after the expiration of a sunset provision.\n\nAt 2:57 p.m. 55-year-old failed entrepreneur Gian Luigi Ferri (born December 29, 1937, as Gianluigi Ettore Ferri) entered an office building at 101 California Street in San Francisco, and made his way to the offices of the law firm Pettit & Martin on the 34th floor. Ferri's reason for targeting the firm is unknown; P&M redirected him to alternative legal counsel about some real estate deals in the Midwest in 1981, and had no contact with him in the 12 years since. They could not advise him on matters out of state. After exiting an elevator, Ferri donned a pair of ear protectors and opened fire with a pair of TEC-9 handguns and a Norinco NP44 (a Chinese-manufactured copy of the Colt M1911 pistol). He reportedly used a mix of Black Talon hollow point and standard ammunition, and used Hell-Fire trigger systems for the TEC-9 pistols. After roaming the 34th floor, he moved down one floor through an internal staircase and continued shooting. The attack continued on several floors before Ferri committed suicide as San Francisco Police closed in. Eight people were killed in the attack, and six others injured.\n\nThe reason for the shootings was never determined. A typed letter left behind by Ferri contained a list of complaints, but the letter was largely unintelligible. Four single spaced pages in length, the letter contained many grammatical errors, misspellings and was typed in all caps. Ferri claimed he had been poisoned by monosodium glutamate (MSG), a flavor enhancer in food, and that he had been \"raped\" by Pettit & Martin and other firms. The letter also contained complaints against the Food and Drug Administration, the legal profession (which he claimed gave \"allegiance to the monarchy\"), and a list of over 30 \"criminals, rapists, , lobbyists\", none of whom were among his actual victims. Pettit & Martin occupied floors 33 (partial floor) and 34 through 36. The main reception floor was 35 and Ferri intended that floor as a target. His elevator stopped at the 34th floor because a secretary from that floor had pushed the up button for an elevator. As a result, Ferri began shooting on the 34th floor and worked his way down to lower floors.\n\n\n\nThe shootings spurred calls for tighter gun control and were followed by a number of legal and legislative actions. California implemented some of the toughest gun laws in the United States. The state also repealed a law that had given gun manufacturers immunity against lawsuits after an attempt by some relatives of 101 California Street victims to sue the companies that made the weapons Ferri used.\n\nThe incident also spurred the installation of security measures now common in most office buildings. Prior to the attack, it was possible for anybody to enter a building and travel to any floor without question. After the attack, security stations were installed in lobbies, employees were required to carry identification badges that granted them access to their suites, and procedures for vendors and visitors established.\n\nA number of organizations were formed in the wake of the shootings, including Legal Community Against Violence, which acts as a resource for information on federal, state, and local firearms policies. The AJC founded the Jack Berman Advocacy Center to lobby and organize with regard to gun control and violence reduction.\n\nThe law firm of Pettit & Martin did not survive the attacks for long. They were already on the decline, and the attacks were a brutal blow to the struggling firm. After the defections of several partners, the firm dissolved in 1995.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "218837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=218837", "title": "Delegation", "text": "Delegation\n\nDelegation is the assignment of any responsibility or authority to another person (normally from a manager to a subordinate) to carry out specific activities. It is one of the core concepts of management leadership. However, the person who delegated the work remains accountable for the outcome of the delegated work. Delegation empowers a subordinate to make decisions, i.e. it is a shifting of decision-making authority from one organizational level to a lower one. Delegation, if properly done, is not fabrication. The opposite of effective delegation is micromanagement, where a manager provides too much input, direction, and review of delegated work. In general, delegation is good and can save money and time, help in building skills, and motivate people. On the other hand, poor delegation might cause frustration and confusion to all the involved parties. Some agents, however, do not favour a delegation and consider the power of making a decision rather burdensome.\n\nAccording to Dr. Kanthi Wijesinghe, Senior Lecturer, National Institute of Education, ‘Delegation begins when the manager passes on some of his responsibilities to the subordinate. Responsibility is the work assigned to an individual’. \n\nWhen assigning these responsibilities to other individuals, these individuals must be willing and ready to be delegated to as well. The delegated readiness of the individuals is an important factor in determining the success of the delegation. Individuals must be prepared for delegation.\n\nDelegation in IT network is also an evolving field.\n\n\nDelegation of Authority/Duties Strategies \n\nAccording to Akinfolarin(2017) , \"Heads can delegate duties to their subordinates by:\n\n1. Allowing assistants to make decisions regarding assigned tasks\n\n2. Delegating authority and responsibility to the right person\n\n3. Providing necessary authority, resources and support to staff\n\n4. Having complete faith in staff ability when delegating duties\n\n5. Giving time to staff to brief you about their assigned tasks among others.\"\n"}

{"id": "48888586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48888586", "title": "Gustaf Wrede", "text": "Gustaf Wrede\n\nGustaf Woldemar Wrede af Elimä (28 July 1889 – 17 February 1958) was a Finnish Freiherr, engineer and businessman. He is best known for his contribution to Finnish tractor production.\n\nWrede was born to influential Finnish industrialist Wrede family; his father Freiherr Carolus Wrede worked as manager in number of Finnish engineering companies. Due to his background, Wrede got a good education and subsequently a good position in his father's company, in which he designed Kullervo tractor.\n\nAs manager of Ab Dalsbruk Wrede grew a hardy manager who saved the company from closure and developed the production. During World War II Wrede led the nickel mining company Petsamon Nikkeli Oy. After the war he led the metal industry production for war reparations to the Soviet Union. As manager of Valmet, Wrede participated in developing of Valmet tractors.\n\nWrede's parents were Freiherr, manager Carolus Wrede and Siri née Söderhjelm. His nickname within the family was \"Dutta\". The affluent Wrede family had been involved in industrial development for generations already. Carolus Wrede was the main owner of engineering companies Åbo Jernmanufaktur and Åbo Waggonfabrik. It was rather natural, that also Gustaf Wrede became oriented to engineering. He studied eight grades in Swedish-speaking \"Nya svenska läroverket\" in Helsinki. In 1907 he started studies in Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany where he graduated in 1911 as Mechanical Engineer.\n\nWrede's sister Siri got married to Wilhelm Wahlforss, who later became an influential businessman. Wrede and Wahlforss worked both as colleagues and later leading large competing engineering companies.\n\nCarolus Wrede's companies produced agricultural machinery and he became interested in tractors, as he saw a big market potential in Russian Plains where fields reached as far as eye can see. Right after his studies Gustaf Wrede to United States to learn more about vehicle production. He worked for a number of automotive companies in 1911–1912. During 1912–1914 he worked as Chief Engineer for Jackson Automobile Company in Michigan, where he focused on learning tractor technology. In 1914 Wrede returned to Finland and became Chief Engineer of Åbo Jernmanufaktur, where he started to develop a tractor. The First World War, which started shortly after, slowed down the development work; the factory was completely stopped during Civil War in 1918. The new tractor was finally introduced in the following autumn. In the meantime, Finland had become an independent state and the prominent Russian market was closed. However, the market of Baltic states looked promising. Serial production of Wrede's tractor named Kullervo started in 1919. Kullervo was produced in two variants of different engine outputs. The stronger, 30-hp version was originally intended for the Russian export. The smaller, 15-hp model was designed for domestic market. While the construction was modern, Kullervo was not sales success; despite of government subsidies, American Fordson ruled the Finnish market. Production ceased in 1924, until when just 300 units were sold.\n\nIn 1920–1922 Wrede worked as General Manager in another agricultural machinery producer Tykö bruks Ab.\n\nWrede was recruited to lead Ab Dalsbruk in 1922; Dalsbruk produced basic ironware products, such as bar iron, chain and nails. Finland was in economical upswing and Wrede started an investment programme. Despite of intense price competition, the company's order book was in a good level. In January 1924 Dalsbruk became part of German Wuppermann company, which secured its financial status giving security to investments; the most important ones were a new foundry and modern rolling mill. The Wuppermann family had high expectations for potential of the Dalsbruk factory and invested on it total 23.5 million Finnish marks. The youngest son of the owning family Gerhard Wuppermann was appointed Deputy Director.\n\nAlready in 1926 the company started to have problems; it was hit by recession and a strike that took for over two months from June until August. Problems continued in the following year, when Dalsbruk was in strike and lockout for total seven months. When this was over, the economic cycle had turned worse. Dalsbruk operated then just four days per week and the number of shifts was cut down. Wuppermann family had to fund the operations by bills of exchange. The company still owned large areas of land which was eventually sold; this reduced the need for money borrowed. In 1929 the company debt reached 5.5 million marks and in addition Wuppermann family had taken debt for Dalsbruk for 10.5 million. The Wuppermanns decided to run down operations in Dalsbruk in a hygienic manner. In September 1930 the family gave Dalsbruk shares to Wrede, whose task was now to make the tough decisions. Salaries were cut, chain and nail production was sold and headcount was reduced. As the Finnish government changed its tariff policy more favourable, Wrede managed to press the losses down in 1930–1931. Abandoning of gold standard in autumn 1931 and the subsequent devaluation improved Dalsbruk's competitiveness. On the other hand, following collapse of international raw material bar cartel, competition had become more intense and prices dropped.\n\nIn 1932 Dalsbruk got a large order for train wheels and axles from the State Railways, which led to immediate improvement; prices had stabilised, the factory was saved, Wrede had become its owner and paid compensation to Wuppermann family for continuation of operations. Wrede continued investing on the Dalsbruk.\n\nBefore Dalsbruk, Wrede had succeeded in his life mainly because of his noble background and wealthy family. The experience he gained as manager had a major impact on the rest of his life and toughened him to perform in his later duties. In 1939 he sold his Dalsbruk shares to Wärtsilä Group, a company led by his brother-in-law, Wilhelm Wahlforss.\n\nDuring 1924–1934 Wrede led Suomen Pultti ja Konetehdas Oy and in 1935–1946 he worked as manager of Suomen Lasitehdas.\n\nWhen the Winter War broke out in 1939, Wrede was appointed the acting manager of Wärtsilä Group in the meantime when Wahlforss travelled abroad to negotiate about war material purchasing.\n\nWrede got an offer for manager position in Petsamon Nikkeli Oy in Petsamo 1940, right after the Winter War. He took the challenging position and sold his Dalsbruk shares. The company management had recently decided to invest on Kolosjoki mine and Wrede led the construction project determinedly. The mine was in focal point in global politics: Petsamon Nikkeli belonged to British Mond Nickel Company which wanted to close the mine when the Finnish-German relations started to improve during the Interim Peace. In response, the Finnish government took the mine under its control. Mining began in 1940 and the nickel was sold to Germany for low price. Continuation War between Finland and Soviet Union began in 1941. Wrede worked under high pressure negotiating about deliveries and other conditions with the German customers. In addition to the company, Wrede led the community grown around the mine. Due to political conditions, Wrede had to leave the mine in September 1944; he placed the company keys on his office desk before he left. Subsequently, Petsamo was ceded to Soviet Union in Moscow Armistice.\n\nAfter the war Wrede was called to lead engineering industry production in Delegation of War Reparation Industry (Soteva), where he worked in 1944–1952. In 1945–1951 he worked as manager of Ares Oy. He was nominated to lead Valmet but the left-wing member of the board resisted the idea. Situation changed in the 1950s after Finland had paid off the war reparations – Valmet fell into crisis, as it had to find new lines of business and start working in free market. The company needed an experienced and determined leader, and Wrede became selected new manager of Valmet in 1954 after nomination by Väinö Tanner. Valmet had been formed by putting together a number of companies, many of them experienced in defence industry. It was the most significant domestic competitor of the other leading Finnish engineering company Wärtsilä Group − managed by Wrede's brother-in-law.\n\nWhen seeking for a new direction, Valmet had started producing tractors. Wrede had a passion to the subject, originating from his youth, and he participated actively on tractor designing. Finnish agriculture mechanised rapidly in the 1950s and Valmet tractors gained a strong foothold in the domestic market.\n\nGustaf Wrede died at his home in Königstedt Manor in February 1958 after suffering of cancer.\n\nDuring 1937–1940 Wrede was chairman of the Finnish Metal Industry Employers' Association. He was board member in Employers' Central Association in 1932–1933, 1937–1943 and 1955–1956 and chairman in 1941–1942.\n\nIn 1935–1940 Wrede was chairman of Dragsfjärd municipal council.\n\nWrede was regarded as proficient engineer. As a manager Wrede was an old school industrialist who rather built connections than oriented on marketing. There are number of examples when Wrede rather approached politicians instead of competing in open market.\n\nWrede was married for three times. A 1915 started marriage with Ebba née Tollet ended in divorce in 1919. He got married again in 1920 to Karin Sophie née Andelin in 1920 and the couple divorced in 1946. In 1948 Wrede got married to Asta née Örtengren; this marriage lasted until Wrede's death.\n\nIn 1949 Wrede bought Königstedt Manor for his residence.\n"}

Bassett\n\nHarry Hoxie Bassett (September 11, 1874 – October 17, 1926) was an American automotive industry executive and president of Buick Motor Car Company, division of General Motors from 1920 through 1926.\n\nBassett was born in Utica, New York, the son of Mary (née Babcock) and William Bassett. Bassett had dreams of being a lawyer but without funds to attend law school, he started his manufacturing career directly out of high school working for the Remington Arms Company. He had to request a day off to be able to attend his high school graduation. He worked for Remington Arms for twelve years when Charles Stewart Mott requested that Bassett become the assistant general manager at Mott's operation in Flint. (Billy Durant had requested that Mott move his wheel and axle manufacturing company from Utica, New York to Flint, Michigan to be closer to the Buick Manufacturing operations in Flint). In 1905, Bassett agreed to join Mott and left his position with Remington Arms.\n\nAfter becoming abreast of Weston-Mott manufacturing operations in Utica, Bassett left for Flint and within one year was promoted to factory manager. The factory in Flint was new and was placed conveniently next to a new Buick manufacturing operation. By 1909, Durant traded General Motors stock for Weston-Mott stock and acquired 49% ownership of the Weston-Mott enterprise. The remaining 51% was purchased by General Motors in 1913 while the company was under the leadership of Charles Williams Nash Although purchased by General Motors, Weston-Mott was positioned within the Buick Car Company. In 1916, Bassett was elected vice-president of the Weston-Mott company and assistant general manager of Buick. That same year, Walter Chrysler then head of Buick Motor Car Company, threatened to leave General Motors as operations were back under control of Billy Durant. Durant offered Chrysler $500,000 annual salary plus bonus to remain with the company which Chrysler did for the next three years, finally resigning in 1919. The last straw for Chrysler was Durant's plan to invest $6M in the factory in Flint to manufacture frames when Chrysler had negotiated with A.O. Smith of Milwaukee to purchase frames cheaper than the Flint factory could produce them. Durant's promoting Bassett to general manager that year, was a bid to position a successor to Chrysler.\n\nWhen Chrysler finally did resign, Bassett was promoted to the Chrysler's position and became president and general manager of Buick. Immediately after taking office, Bassett was charged with implementing the $6M investment in the factory in Flint to manufacture frames and an additional $3M to establish a new factory in St. Louis.\n\nBassett was very popular among the workers in his factories, many of whom referred to him as \"Harry.\" Forbes wrote the following after interviewing Bassett: \"I once had a similar experience on a tour through a Buick plant with Harry Bassett, then its president. He was \"Harry\" to hundreds of men; he was constantly on his feet going from department to department of the plant; the men approached him and he approached them as if there were not the slightest distinction in their status and, if he ran short of tobacco, he thought nothing of asking an overawed workman to give him a chew.\" Forbes went on, \"I learned from other officials that all the men who had been with the company for any time felt that they were working, not for some monster corporation, but for Harry Bassett, and that it was up to them to do their best by him and for him.\"\nBassett travelled to Paris with a number of General Motors executives to attend the Paris Auto Show. While there, he contracted a cold which turned into bronchial pneumonia and on 17 October 1926, Bassett died. Bassett's body was returned to the United States and was brought by special train from Detroit to Flint on the 5th of November 1926. His body lay in state in Flint the next day.

After a couple of years he left the regiment to study at the Technological Institute of Stockholm (later known as KTH).\n\nIn partnership with his brother-in-law, Theodor Winborg, Palmcrantz founded a small workshop on Vollmar Yxkullsgatan 25, Södermalm, Stockholm. As number of employees increased along with the production volume, he moved to a new factory on Kungsholmen, Stockholm, where they manufactured firearms, reaping machines, mowers and other agricultural equipment of their own design. Later on there would be Palmcrantz & Co factory on Lövholmen, Stockholm as well; later called Palmcrantzska Fabriken.\n\nIn 1868, the first version of his machine-gun was finished and a demonstration of its capacity was held on Ladugårdsgärdet, Stockholm in front of the Swedish Defense Minister; G.R. Abel. After a couple of modifications and improvements, he patented the multi-barrel, lever-actuated, machine gun and it was bought into the Swedish army as Kulspruta m/1873. Same year, the machine-gun was shown on the 1873 Vienna World's Fair. To reach international success, Palmcrantz met Nordenfelt in 1875 and the latter's company became his British agent. They agreed to market the machine-gun under the then well known Nordenfelt brand and his second model kulspruta m/1875 would later be known as the \"Nordenfelt machine-gun\" after his financial backer, Thorsten Nordenfelt. . It was Nordenfelt who convinced Palmcrantz to increase the caliber of his gun to one inch, making it a suitable weapon for use against the growing threat of torpedo boats.\n\nAfter Palmcrantz succumbed to an early death from a bleeding ulcer, Winborg and Nordenfelt continued to develop and manufacture his guns in Sweden, England and Spain.\n\nHelge Palmcrantz has a school named after him; Palmcrantzskolan in Östersund.

Hart. Historically, the downtown portion of Laura Street has been considered the financial district of Jacksonville.\n\nThe street's contiguous segment runs from 12th Street in the historic neighborhood of Springfield south through downtown, terminating at Independent Drive. South of State Street, Laura Street runs though the core of downtown's Northbank, and is one of the busiest pedestrian streets in the city.\n\nServing as an important corridor connecting a high concentration of office blocks, the area has historically functioned as a preeminent shopping and financial district, and has remained an important economic and cultural epicenter for the region. The street is also home to Jacksonville's oldest park, Hemming Park, the Jacksonville Landing, Main Public Library, the Museum of Contemporary Art Jacksonville, and City Hall.\n\nLaura Street was named for the daughter of Jacksonville's founder, Isaiah D. Hart. In 1856, the city's oldest public park was designated along Laura Street, occupying the entire city block bordered by Monroe, Hogan and Duval Streets. The area attracted numerous hotels, most notably the St. James Hotel, completed in 1869, and the Windsor Hotel, completed in 1875.\nThe Great Fire of 1901 ravaged almost the entirety of today's modern downtown core, including much of Laura Street. The street did act as a fire line between the junctions of Adams Street through to the St. Johns River. Just as in the 1871 Great Chicago Fire, the massive level of destruction left in the wake of the fire precipitated a robust period growth and a building boom that would last up until the Great Depression. The corridor between Adams Street, where a remaining portion of the business district still existed, and Hemming Park, was the center of much of the more notable commercial development.\nOriginally the Mercantile Exchange Bank Building, one of the first buildings to be built after the fire was the Old Florida National Bank in 1902. It was designed by Edward H. Glidden in the Classical Revival style, and is now part of a group of buildings known as the Laura Street Trio. Architect Henry John Klutho designed the other two buildings: the Bisbee Building in 1908, and the Florida Life Building in 1911, both designed in the Chicago school of architecture. He also designed the YMCA Building in 1909, and the St. James Building in 1912. New York architecture firm Mowbray and Uffinger contributed two significant structures to the corridor during this period. In 1909, 121 Atlantic Place, originally Atlantic National Bank Building, opened as the tallest building in Florida. Barnett National Bank Building opened its doors in 1926, also breaking the state height record. Local architecture firm Marsh & Saxelbye also contributed multiple works along the route, including Karpeles Manuscript Library Museum (1921), Schultz Building (1926), Hotel George Washington (1926) and Greenleaf & Crosby Building (1928).\n\nRTKL Associates Inc., a planning and consultant firm from Baltimore, was hired in 1970 to study the city's increasing urban blight related to suburbanization and the development of retail malls. The recommendations were included in the 1971 Downtown Master Plan drafted by the Downtown Development Authority. The plans called for creating a pedestrian mall, a one-way transportation loop and elevated walkways that would permitting safe movement from the retail core, centered on Hemming Park, to the riverfront. The plans further called for a riverfront park, convention center with attached hotel, an exhibition center, Sears Department Store, and a high-rise offices. Though many portions of the plan never came to fruition, a few of Laura Street's features are a result of the 1971 Downtown Master Plan, the most striking of which was the Wells Fargo Center, designed by Kemp, Bunch & Jackson in 1974 for the Independent Life Insurance Company.\n\nIn 2011, $2.3 million was spent to enhance the street by adding traffic calming features, more sidewalk space, trees with colorful uplighting and other hardscape features. In 2015, a five-block segment of Laura Street beginning at West Duval Street near Hemming Park, stretching to the Jacksonville Landing, and ending at East Independent Drive, was recognized by the American Planning Association as one of its \"Great Places in America.\"\n\nFrom south to north:\n\nThe Jacksonville Landing is at the southern terminus of Laura Street and offers access to the Jacksonville Water Taxi as well as other marine services.\n\nThe Jacksonville Skyway serves two stations near Laura Street:\n\n"}

{"id": "20232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20232", "title": "Messenger RNA", "text": "Messenger RNA\n\nMessenger RNA (mRNA) is a large family of RNA molecules that convey genetic information from DNA to the ribosome, where they specify the amino acid sequence of the protein products of gene expression. RNA polymerase transcribes primary transcript mRNA (known as pre-mRNA) into processed, mature mRNA. This mature mRNA is then translated into a polymer of amino acids: a protein, as summarized in the central dogma of molecular biology.\n\nAs in DNA, mRNA genetic information is in the sequence of nucleotides, which are arranged into codons consisting of three base pairs each. Each codon encodes for a specific amino acid, except the stop codons, which terminate protein synthesis. This process of translation of codons into amino acids requires two other types of RNA: Transfer RNA (tRNA), that mediates recognition of the codon and provides the corresponding amino acid, and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), that is the central component of the ribosome's protein-manufacturing machinery.\n\nThe existence of mRNA was first suggested by Jacques Monod and François Jacob, and subsequently discovered by Jacob, Sydney Brenner and Matthew Meselson at the California Institute of Technology in 1961.\n\nIt should not be confused with mitochondrial DNA.\n\nThe brief existence of an mRNA molecule begins with transcription, and ultimately ends in degradation. During its life, an mRNA molecule may also be processed, edited, and transported prior to translation. Eukaryotic mRNA molecules often require extensive processing and transport, while prokaryotic mRNA molecules do not. A molecule of eukaryotic mRNA and the proteins surrounding it are together called a messenger RNP.\n\nTranscription is when RNA is made from DNA. During transcription, RNA polymerase makes a copy of a gene from the DNA to mRNA as needed. This process is similar in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. One notable difference, however, is that eukaryotic RNA polymerase associates with mRNA-processing enzymes during transcription so that processing can proceed quickly after the start of transcription. The short-lived, unprocessed or partially processed product is termed \"precursor mRNA\", or \"pre-mRNA\"; once completely processed, it is termed \"mature mRNA\".\n\nProcessing of mRNA differs greatly among eukaryotes, bacteria, and archea. Non-eukaryotic mRNA is, in essence, mature upon transcription and requires no processing, except in rare cases. Eukaryotic pre-mRNA, however, requires extensive processing.\n\nA \"5' cap\" (also termed an RNA cap, an RNA 7-methylguanosine cap, or an RNA mG cap) is a modified guanine nucleotide that has been added to the \"front\" or 5' end of a eukaryotic messenger RNA shortly after the start of transcription. The 5' cap consists of a terminal 7-methylguanosine residue that is linked through a 5'-5'-triphosphate bond to the first transcribed nucleotide. Its presence is critical for recognition by the ribosome and protection from RNases.\n\nCap addition is coupled to transcription, and occurs co-transcriptionally, such that each influences the other. Shortly after the start of transcription, the 5' end of the mRNA being synthesized is bound by a cap-synthesizing complex associated with RNA polymerase. This enzymatic complex catalyzes the chemical reactions that are required for mRNA capping. Synthesis proceeds as a multi-step biochemical reaction.\n\nIn some instances, an mRNA will be edited, changing the nucleotide composition of that mRNA. An example in humans is the apolipoprotein B mRNA, which is edited in some tissues, but not others. The editing creates an early stop codon, which, upon translation, produces a shorter protein.\n\nPolyadenylation is the covalent linkage of a polyadenylyl moiety to a messenger RNA molecule. In eukaryotic organisms most messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules are polyadenylated at the 3' end, but recent studies have shown that short stretches of uridine (oligouridylation) are also common. The poly(A) tail and the protein bound to it aid in protecting mRNA from degradation by exonucleases. Polyadenylation is also important for transcription termination, export of the mRNA from the nucleus, and translation. mRNA can also be polyadenylated in prokaryotic organisms, where poly(A) tails act to facilitate, rather than impede, exonucleolytic degradation.\n\nPolyadenylation occurs during and/or immediately after transcription of DNA into RNA. After transcription has been terminated, the mRNA chain is cleaved through the action of an endonuclease complex associated with RNA polymerase. After the mRNA has been cleaved, around 250 adenosine residues are added to the free 3' end at the cleavage site. This reaction is catalyzed by polyadenylate polymerase. Just as in alternative splicing, there can be more than one polyadenylation variant of an mRNA.\n\nPolyadenylation site mutations also occur. The primary RNA transcript of a gene is cleaved at the poly-A addition site, and 100-200 A's are added to the 3’ end of the RNA. If this site is altered, an abnormally long and unstable mRNA construct will be formed.\n\nAnother difference between eukaryotes and prokaryotes is mRNA transport. Because eukaryotic transcription and translation is compartmentally separated, eukaryotic mRNAs must be exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm—a process that may be regulated by different signaling pathways. Mature mRNAs are recognized by their processed modifications and then exported through the nuclear pore by binding to the cap-binding proteins CBP20 and CBP80, as well as the transcription/export complex (TREX). Multiple mRNA export pathways have been identified in eukaryotes.\n\nIn spatially complex cells, some mRNAs are transported to particular subcellar destinations. In mature neurons, certain mRNA are transported from the soma to dendrites. One site of mRNA translation is at polyribosomes selectively localized beneath synapses. The mRNA for Arc/Arg3.1 is induced by synaptic activity and localizes selectively near active synapses based on signals generated by NMDA receptors. Other mRNAs also move into dendrites in response to external stimuli, such as β-actin mRNA. Upon export from the nucleus, actin mRNA associates with ZBP1 and the 40S subunit. The complex is bound by a motor protein and is transported to the target location (neurite extension) along the cytoskeleton. Eventually ZBP1 is phosphorylated by Src in order for translation to be initiated. In developing neurons, mRNAs are also transported into growing axons and especially growth cones. Many mRNAs are marked with so-called \"zip codes,\" which target their transport to a specific location.\n\nBecause prokaryotic mRNA does not need to be processed or transported, translation by the ribosome can begin immediately after the end of transcription. Therefore, it can be said that prokaryotic translation is \"coupled\" to transcription and occurs \"co-transcriptionally\".\n\nEukaryotic mRNA that has been processed and transported to the cytoplasm (i.e., mature mRNA) can then be translated by the ribosome. Translation may occur at ribosomes free-floating in the cytoplasm, or directed to the endoplasmic reticulum by the signal recognition particle. Therefore, unlike in prokaryotes, eukaryotic translation \"is not\" directly coupled to transcription. It is even possible in some contexts that reduced mRNA levels are accompanied by increased protein levels, as has been observed for mRNA/protein levels of EEF1A1 in breast cancer.\n\nCoding regions are composed of codons, which are decoded and translated (in eukaryotes usually into one and in prokaryotes usually into several) into proteins by the ribosome. Coding regions begin with the start codon and end with a stop codon. In general, the start codon is an AUG triplet and the stop codon is UAA, UAG, or UGA. The coding regions tend to be stabilised by internal base pairs, this impedes degradation. In addition to being protein-coding, portions of coding regions may serve as regulatory sequences in the pre-mRNA as exonic splicing enhancers or exonic splicing silencers.\n\nUntranslated regions (UTRs) are sections of the mRNA before the start codon and after the stop codon that are not translated, termed the five prime untranslated region (5' UTR) and three prime untranslated region (3' UTR), respectively. These regions are transcribed with the coding region and thus are exonic as they are present in the mature mRNA. Several roles in gene expression have been attributed to the untranslated regions, including mRNA stability, mRNA localization, and translational efficiency. The ability of a UTR to perform these functions depends on the sequence of the UTR and can differ between mRNAs. Genetic variants in 3' UTR have also been implicated in disease susceptibility because of the change in RNA structure and protein translation.\n\nThe stability of mRNAs may be controlled by the 5' UTR and/or 3' UTR due to varying affinity for RNA degrading enzymes called ribonucleases and for ancillary proteins that can promote or inhibit RNA degradation. (See also, C-rich stability element.)\n\nTranslational efficiency, including sometimes the complete inhibition of translation, can be controlled by UTRs. Proteins that bind to either the 3' or 5' UTR may affect translation by influencing the ribosome's ability to bind to the mRNA. MicroRNAs bound to the 3' UTR also may affect translational efficiency or mRNA stability.\n\nCytoplasmic localization of mRNA is thought to be a function of the 3' UTR. Proteins that are needed in a particular region of the cell can also be translated there; in such a case, the 3' UTR may contain sequences that allow the transcript to be localized to this region for translation.\n\nSome of the elements contained in untranslated regions form a characteristic secondary structure when transcribed into RNA. These structural mRNA elements are involved in regulating the mRNA. Some, such as the SECIS element, are targets for proteins to bind. One class of mRNA element, the riboswitches, directly bind small molecules, changing their fold to modify levels of transcription or translation. In these cases, the mRNA regulates itself.\n\nThe 3' poly(A) tail is a long sequence of adenine nucleotides (often several hundred) added to the 3' end of the pre-mRNA. This tail promotes export from the nucleus and translation, and protects the mRNA from degradation.\n\nAn mRNA molecule is said to be monocistronic when it contains the genetic information to translate only a single protein chain (polypeptide). This is the case for most of the eukaryotic mRNAs. On the other hand, polycistronic mRNA carries several open reading frames (ORFs), each of which is translated into a polypeptide. These polypeptides usually have a related function (they often are the subunits composing a final complex protein) and their coding sequence is grouped and regulated together in a regulatory region, containing a promoter and an operator. Most of the mRNA found in bacteria and archaea is polycistronic, as is the human mitochondrial genome. Dicistronic or bicistronic mRNA encodes only two proteins.\n\nIn eukaryotes mRNA molecules form circular structures due to an interaction between the eIF4E and poly(A)-binding protein, which both bind to eIF4G, forming an mRNA-protein-mRNA bridge. Circularization is thought to promote cycling of ribosomes on the mRNA leading to time-efficient translation, and may also function to ensure only intact mRNA are translated (partially degraded mRNA characteristically have no m7G cap, or no poly-A tail).\n\nOther mechanisms for circularization exist, particularly in virus mRNA. Poliovirus mRNA uses a cloverleaf section towards its 5' end to bind PCBP2, which binds poly(A)-binding protein, forming the familiar mRNA-protein-mRNA circle. Barley yellow dwarf virus has binding between mRNA segments on its 5' end and 3' end (called kissing stem loops), circularizing the mRNA without any proteins involved.\n\nRNA virus genomes (the + strands of which are translated as mRNA) are also commonly circularized. During genome replication the circularization acts to enhance genome replication speeds, cycling viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase much the same as the ribosome is hypothesized to cycle.\n\nDifferent mRNAs within the same cell have distinct lifetimes (stabilities). In bacterial cells, individual mRNAs can survive from seconds to more than an hour. However, the lifetime averages between 1 and 3 minutes, making bacterial mRNA much less stable than eukaryotic mRNA. In mammalian cells, mRNA lifetimes range from several minutes to days. The greater the stability of an mRNA the more protein may be produced from that mRNA. The limited lifetime of mRNA enables a cell to alter protein synthesis rapidly in response to its changing needs. There are many mechanisms that lead to the destruction of an mRNA, some of which are described below.\n\nIn general, in prokaryotes the lifetime of mRNA is much shorter than in eukaryotes. Prokaryotes degrade messages by using a combination of ribonucleases, including endonucleases, 3' exonucleases, and 5' exonucleases. In some instances, small RNA molecules (sRNA) tens to hundreds of nucleotides long can stimulate the degradation of specific mRNAs by base-pairing with complementary sequences and facilitating ribonuclease cleavage by RNase III. It was recently shown that bacteria also have a sort of 5' cap consisting of a triphosphate on the 5' end. Removal of two of the phosphates leaves a 5' monophosphate, causing the message to be destroyed by the exonuclease RNase J, which degrades 5' to 3'.\n\nInside eukaryotic cells, there is a balance between the processes of translation and mRNA decay. Messages that are being actively translated are bound by ribosomes, the eukaryotic initiation factors eIF-4E and eIF-4G, and poly(A)-binding protein. eIF-4E and eIF-4G block the decapping enzyme (DCP2), and poly(A)-binding protein blocks the exosome complex, protecting the ends of the message. The balance between translation and decay is reflected in the size and abundance of cytoplasmic structures known as P-bodies The poly(A) tail of the mRNA is shortened by specialized exonucleases that are targeted to specific messenger RNAs by a combination of cis-regulatory sequences on the RNA and trans-acting RNA-binding proteins. Poly(A) tail removal is thought to disrupt the circular structure of the message and destabilize the cap binding complex. The message is then subject to degradation by either the exosome complex or the decapping complex. In this way, translationally inactive messages can be destroyed quickly, while active messages remain intact. The mechanism by which translation stops and the message is handed-off to decay complexes is not understood in detail.\n\nThe presence of AU-rich elements in some mammalian mRNAs tends to destabilize those transcripts through the action of cellular proteins that bind these sequences and stimulate poly(A) tail removal. Loss of the poly(A) tail is thought to promote mRNA degradation by facilitating attack by both the exosome complex and the decapping complex. Rapid mRNA degradation via AU-rich elements is a critical mechanism for preventing the overproduction of potent cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). AU-rich elements also regulate the biosynthesis of proto-oncogenic transcription factors like c-Jun and c-Fos.\n\nEukaryotic messages are subject to surveillance by nonsense mediated decay (NMD), which checks for the presence of premature stop codons (nonsense codons) in the message. These can arise via incomplete splicing, V(D)J recombination in the adaptive immune system, mutations in DNA, transcription errors, leaky scanning by the ribosome causing a frame shift, and other causes. Detection of a premature stop codon triggers mRNA degradation by 5' decapping, 3' poly(A) tail removal, or endonucleolytic cleavage.\n\nIn metazoans, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) processed by Dicer are incorporated into a complex known as the RNA-induced silencing complex or RISC. This complex contains an endonuclease that cleaves perfectly complementary messages to which the siRNA binds. The resulting mRNA fragments are then destroyed by exonucleases. siRNA is commonly used in laboratories to block the function of genes in cell culture. It is thought to be part of the innate immune system as a defense against double-stranded RNA viruses.\n\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that typically are partially complementary to sequences in metazoan messenger RNAs. Binding of a miRNA to a message can repress translation of that message and accelerate poly(A) tail removal, thereby hastening mRNA degradation. The mechanism of action of miRNAs is the subject of active research.\n\nThere are other ways by which messages can be degraded, including non-stop decay and silencing by Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA), among others.\n\nFull length mRNA molecules have been proposed as therapeutics since the beginning of the biotech era but there was little traction until the 2010s, when Moderna Therapeutics was founded and managed to raise almost a billion dollars in venture funding in its first three years.\n\nTheoretically, the administered mRNA sequence can cause a cell to make a protein, which in turn could directly treat a disease or could function as a vaccine; more indirectly the protein could drive an endogenous stem cell to differentiate in a desired way.\n\nThe primary challenges of RNA therapy center on delivering the RNA to directed cells, more even than determining what sequence to deliver. Naked RNA sequences will naturally degrade after preparation; they may trigger the body's immune system to attack them as an invader; and they are impermeable to the cell membrane. Once within the cell, they must then leave the cell's transport mechanism to take action within the cytoplasm, which houses the ribosomes that direct manufacture of proteins.\n\n\n\n"}

This model is one of several attempting to help companies in their innovation management.\n\nCohen started his career at Getratex SA in 1975, where his first intrapreneurial opportunity was to create a new business unit to sell fashion wear. This unit eventually became one of the most dynamic licensees of Walt Disney as the first to sell Disney sportswear successfully to adults in North America and Europe. To reduce his exposure to the fashion industry, in 1980 he initiated a diversification, which led him to invest in several startups. Since he became a business angel Cohen has been involved in many businesses including tourist attractions, theming of public areas, surface treatments, financial derivatives, internet marketing, software, skin treatments, retail, real estate, construction and high-tech projects. As a trusted advisor for several large corporations he became an expert in corporate innovation and intrapreneurship.\n\nCohen started Management Boosters in 2001, as a division of Getratex SA, to provide corporate clients with consulting and training services focusing on the acquisition of competitive advantages.

The model is meant to help innovators analyze and mature their idea to produce an opportunity case or a business plan to convince themselves and decision-makers, such as investors or management of the merits of the opportunity.\nTo help organizations benefit from the innovative ability of their employees Cohen has designed and implemented the MicroMBA MB program. Combining the IpOp Model with the fundamentals taught in an executive MBA, the MicroMBA MB enables middle managers to become proactive agents of change. Participants in the program must identify and implement a real project that supports the strategy of their employer.

Separate Beds in the UK) is a 1963 romantic comedy film from Metro Goldwyn Mayer, produced by Martin Ransohoff, directed by Arthur Hiller, that stars James Garner and Lee Remick, and co-stars Phil Harris, Chill Wills, Jim Backus, and Patricia Crowley. The film's screenplay was written by George Goodman and Ira Wallach, based on Goodman's 1959 novel of the same name.\n\nGarner was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.\n\nMolly Thatcher (Lee Remick) is a stockbroker languishing in a company run by male chauvinist Bullard Bear (Jim Backus). When the company does poorly, he will have to fire somebody; As the only female employee, Molly is the obvious choice since if any of the male employees are fired, it would look like the company is in trouble. He assigns her the seemingly impossible task of unloading shares of an obscure company called Universal Widgets; when she fails, he will have an excuse to dismiss her.\n\nMolly meets Henry Tyroon (James Garner), an aggressive wheeler dealer who dresses, talks, and acts like a stereotypical Texas millionaire. He's more interested in her than in Universal Widgets, but decides to be of help in order to get closer to her. As they spend time together, Molly watches Henry make complicated business deals, often in partnership with his Texan cronies, Jay Ray (Chill Wills), Ray Jay (Phil Harris), and J.R. (Charles Watts). One such deal is a venture into dealing modern art, with the aid of Stanislas (Louis Nye), a cynical avant-garde painter.\n\nMolly and Henry have trouble figuring out Universal Widgets' reason for existence; its only factory burned down around the time of the Spanish-American War. It manufactures nothing and provides no services. (Widgets had something to do with horse-drawn carriages.) It's just a corporation on paper whose sole asset is a huge block of shares in AT&T, bought long, long ago when the stock was ridiculously cheap. Now it pays out hefty, regular dividends to its two complacent shareholders.\n\nWhen Henry makes attempts to take control of Universal Widgets by what appears to be questionable methods, over-enthusiastic government regulator Hector Vanson (John Astin) takes him to Federal court. Further complications arise when Jay Ray, Ray Jay, and J.R. get Molly fired so that she will spend more time in Texas with Henry. She thinks Henry is responsible after discovering that he is really an Easterner and a Yale University graduate; the Texan act just helps him with his wheeling and dealing. The judge dismisses the Federal Securities Commission case when it is determined that all the Universal Widgets' shares are controlled by just six people, including Henry and the Texans, not the general public; the Texans trio's interest is bought out, then and there, for a sizable profit. The trio also confesses that they were the ones who had Molly fired. After hearing this, she quickly makes up with Henry.\n\n\n\"The New York Times\" reviewer Bosley Crowther was unimpressed, writing \"somehow the script of George J. W. Goodman and Ira Wallach doesn't jell and isn't droll, and Arthur Hiller's direction is too slow for romantic comedy. What might be brightly satiric simply isn't because it lacks wit. Too much double entry and too little double entendre\". He did, however, like Garner (\"spry and briskly charming\") and Remick (\"cute\").\n\nReviewer Glenn Erickson characterized it as an \"entertaining trifle that, if I read it right, outsmarts itself. Nobody on either side of the camera seems to know that the joke is really on them, and us, and our way of life\". He thought both stars gave \"outstanding performances\" and rated the film \"Good +\".\n\n\"The Wheeler Dealers\" was released on June 27, 2011 by Warner Home Video as a widescreen Region 1 DVD via its Warner Archive DVD-on-demand service. The film's Blu-ray release came on April 25, 2017.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "28831284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28831284", "title": "Voluntary association", "text": "Voluntary association\n\nA voluntary group or union (also sometimes called a voluntary organization, common-interest association, association, or society) is a group of individuals who enter into an agreement, usually as volunteers, to form a body (or organization) to accomplish a purpose. Common examples include trade associations, trade unions, learned societies, professional associations, and environmental groups.\n\nMembership is not necessarily voluntary: in order for particular associations to function correctly they might need to be mandatory or at least strongly encouraged, as is common with many teachers unions in the US. Because of this, some people use the term common-interest association to describe groups which form out of a common interest, although this term is not widely used or understood.\n\nVoluntary associations may be incorporated or unincorporated; for example, in the US, unions gained additional powers by incorporating. In the UK, the terms Voluntary Association or Voluntary Organisation cover every type of group from a small local Residents' Association to large Associations (often Registered Charities) with multimillion-pound turnover that run large-scale business operations (often providing some kind of public service as subcontractors to government departments or local authorities).\n\nIn many jurisdictions no formalities are necessary to start an association. In some jurisdictions, there is a minimum for the number of persons starting an association.\n\nSome jurisdictions require that the association register with the police or other official body to inform the public of the association's existence. This could be a tool of political control or intimidation, and also a way of protecting the economy from fraud.\n\nIn many such jurisdictions, only a registered association (or in the UK an incorporated body) is a juristic person whose members are not responsible for the financial acts of the association. Any group of persons may, of course, work as an informal association, but in such cases, each person making a transaction in the name of the association takes responsibility for that transaction, just as if it were that individual's personal transaction.\n\nThere are many countries where the formation of truly independent Voluntary Associations is effectively proscribed by law or where they are theoretically legally permitted, but in practice are persecuted; for example, where membership brings unwelcome attention from police or other state agencies.\n\nVoluntary groups are a broad and original form of nonprofit organizations, and have existed since ancient history. In Ancient Greece, for example, there were various organizations ranging from elite clubs of wealthy men (\"hetaireiai\") to private religious or professional associations.\n\nIn preindustrial societies, governmental administrative duties were often handled by voluntary associations such as guilds. In medieval Europe, guilds often controlled towns. Merchant guilds enforced contracts through embargoes and sanctions on their members, and also adjudicated disputes. However, by the 1800s, merchant guilds had largely disappeared. Economic historians have debated the precise role that merchant guilds played in premodern society and economic growth.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, craft guilds were more successful than merchant guilds and formed livery companies which exerted significant influence on society.\n\nA standard definition of an unincorporated association was given by Lord Justice Lawton in the English trust law case \"Conservative and Unionist Central Office v Burrell\" (1981):\n\nIn most countries, an unincorporated association does not have separate legal personality, and few members of the association usually enjoy limited liability. However, in some countries they are treated as having separate legal personality for tax purposes. However, because of their lack of legal personality, legacies to unincorporated associations are sometimes subject to general common law prohibitions against purpose trusts.\n\nAssociations that are organized for profit or financial gain are usually called partnerships. A special kind of partnership is a co-operative which is usually founded on one person—one vote principle and distributes its profits according to the amount of goods produced or bought by the members. Associations may take the form of a non-profit organization or they may be not-for-profit corporations; this does not mean that the association cannot make benefits from its activity, but all the benefits must be reinvested. Most associations have some kind of document or documents that regulate the way in which the body meets and operates. Such an instrument is often called the organization's bylaws, constitution, regulations, or agreement of association.\n\nUnder English law, an unincorporated association consists of two or more members bound by the rules of a society which has at some point in time, been founded.\n\nSeveral theories have been proposed as to the way that such associations hold rights. A transfer may be considered to have been made to the association's members directly as joint tenants or tenants in common. Alternatively, the funds transferred may be considered to have been under the terms of a private purpose trust. Many purpose trusts fail for want of a beneficiary and this may therefore may result in the gift failing. However, some purpose trusts are valid, and, accordingly, some cases have decided that the rights associated with unincorporated associations are held on this basis. The dominant theory, however, is that the rights are transferred to the members or officers absolutely, perhaps on trust for the members, but are importantly bound by contracts \"inter se\".\n\nAccordingly, on dissolution, the distribution of these rights depends on how they were held. A purpose trust may by its nature survive the dissolution of the association, or it may not. If it fails as a result of the dissolution, then the rights will be held on resulting trust for the contributors, unless they can be shown to have renounced their right to such a trust in their favour. If the rights are held subject to contract, then they will be divided among the surviving membership upon dissolution, according to the terms of the contracts \"inter se\" or an implied term according to contribution. If, as a result of this contract or statute, no member can claim, the rights will pass to the Crown as \"bona vacantia\". This conclusion has also been suggested where the association dissolves because only one member remains, although this has been doubted by some commentators who believe the last members should be entitled to the rights.\n\nScottish law on unincorporated associations is essentially the same as English law.\n\nEach state sets its own laws as to what constitutes an unincorporated association and how it is to be treated under the laws. In the United States, voluntary associations which were incorporated were \"pre-eminent\" in collective action.\n\nIn most Australian states and territories, a similar set of laws allows not-for-profit associations to become legal entities with a limit to the liability of their members. An example of such a law, the Associations Incorporation Act that is in force in South Australia, allows for the creation of a legal entity able to buy and sell land and in general, enter into legally binding contracts. Many clubs and societies begin life as an unincorporated body and seek to attain incorporated status to protect its members from legal liability and in many cases to seek government financial assistance only available to an incorporated body. Clubs and societies wishing to incorporate must meet the provisions of the relevant state act and lodge their constitution with the corresponding state government authority.\n\nCertain civil-law systems classify an association as a special form of contractual relationship.\n\nUnder the Quebec Civil Code an association is categorized as a type of statutory specific contract set forth in a constitution. An association can become incorporated with its own legal identity so that it may, e.g., open a bank account, enter into contracts (rent real estate, hire employees, take out an insurance policy), or sue or be sued.\n\nIn France, all voluntary associations are non-profit. They may count as unincorporated (\"association non-déclarée\") or incorporated (\"association déclarée\"), and are created in terms of and governed by the Waldeck-Rousseau Act 1901. This is why \"\" is subjoined to their name, except in Alsace-Moselle area which is governed by local law in this regard (the area was German in 1901) and are therefore called \"\".. If the association responding to defined criteria, like social or medical help for example, they can be declared \"public utility association\" (\"association d'utilité publique\") by French authorities. Associations act 1901 let an important large of freedom about internal operation, like direction or authorized members for example.\n\nThe German Civil Code sets out different rights and rules for an unincorporated association (\"nicht eingetragener Verein\") with legal identity (\"Vereine\", art. 21-79 BGB) versus an incorporated association (\"eingetragener Verein\") with full legal personality, which the law treats as partnerships (\"Gesellschaften\", art. 705-740 BGB). Associations can be for-profit (\"wirtschaftlicher Verein\"), non-for-profit (\"Idealverein\"), or public (\"gemeinnütziger Verein\").\n\nIn Israel, many non-profit organizations (NPOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are established as registered nonprofit associations (Hebrew \"amutah,\" plural \"amutot\") (some are established as public benefit companies (Hebrew \"Chevrah LeTo’elet Hatzibur\") not to be confused with public benefit corporations). ‘‘Amutot’’ are regulated by the Associations Law, 1980. An \"amutah\" is a body corporate, though not a company. The \"amutah\" is successor to the Ottoman Society which predated the State of Israel, and was established by the now-superseded Ottoman Societies Law of 1909, based on the French law of 1901. An \"amutah\" must register with the \"Rasham Ha’amutot\" ('Registrar of Amutot'), under the purview of the \"Rashot Hata’agidim\" ('Corporations Authority') of the Ministry of Justice.\n\nThe freedom of association stands in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: \nArticle 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights also protects the right to freedom of assembly and association.\n\n\n"}
