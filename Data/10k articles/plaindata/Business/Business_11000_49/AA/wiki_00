If enterprises or public administrations want to engage in automated business processes with other organizations, their IT systems must be able to work together, i.e. they need to be interoperable. The AIOS represents a generic building plan for these organizations to develop interoperable information systems by systematically adjusting and extending their internal information systems.\nThe AIOS was described in a doctoral thesis and is based on the results of various research projects on interoperability. It is independent from specific products or vendors but describes generically the different layers, views, relationships and technical means needed to efficiently establish interoperable information systems. To this aim it combines concepts from service-oriented architecture, Collaborative Business and Business Process Modelling. It can be seen as complementary to ARIS, a well-known architecture for internal information systems and business processes.\n\nSimilar to the automation of processes inside organizations, the automation of cross-organizational business processes is an important trend. In this endeavor, collaborating organizations rather strive for a loose coupling of their information systems instead of a tight integration: the collaborating information systems should be able to work together but retain as much independency as possible. This characteristic is also called interoperability, or in the context of collaborating organizations, Business Interoperability, i.e. the capability of autonomous organizations to execute a collaborative business process among them.\n\nInformation systems are systems that process information, i.e. they capture, transport, transform, store and offer information. Following the conception prevailing in information systems research, an information system comprises not only the hardware and software of an enterprise, but also the related human actors, business functions and processes as well as organization structures. This broad understanding is for example also embodied by the Zachman Framework.\n\nArchitecture is defined as the “fundamental organization of a system, embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing its design and evolution”. Sinz defines an information system architecture as the building plan of an information system in the sense of a specification and documentation of its components and their relationships covering all relevant viewpoints as well as the constructions rules for the creation of the building plan.\n\nAccordingly, an Architecture of Interoperable Information Systems can be defined as the building plan of a cross-organizational information system, which enables organizations to execute a collaborative business process among them.\n\nFollowing the work on interoperable information systems conducted in European Research Projects in 2010 the Architecture of Interoperable Information Systems (AIOS) was published as a reference for the construction of loosely coupled, interoperating information systems and for the systematic, model-based enactment of collaborative business processes.\n\nThe AIOS aims primarily at large organizations that want to interoperate with each other. To this aim it describes how internal information system elements can be systematically connected with the information systems of collaboration partners. The main elements of the AIOS are:\nOne element comprised in the third category is a \"BII-repository\", in which each organization publishes the content of its Business Interoperability Interface (BII) to collaboration partners. Since it comprises external views on information system elements, it provides publishing and discovery functionalities as needed in service-oriented architecture: In the BII, the externally relevant processes, services, organization structures etc. are described on various levels of technical granularity, enabling other organizations to search also for business-level elements and not only for technical artifacts. Here, different from the traditional SOA approach, instead of one central service directory, various partner-specific repositories are implemented.\n\nThe static part of the architecture builds on three orthogonal axes: Enterprise Dimensions, Levels of technical Granularity and Colloborative Views.\n\nSimilar to private, public and global views as known from business process and workflow modeling, in the AIOS, corresponding private, public and global views on information system elements are provided.\n\nTo describe business processes comprehensively this axis provides distinct views on processes, functions, data, and organizational elements. \nThus, in combination with the axis \"collaborative views\", private, public and global views on processes, functions, data, and organizational roles are provided.\n\nThe description of system elements on different levels of technical granularity supports a systematic development of collaborative information systems, starting with the business requirements definition and going all the way down to the code level. Apart from the construction aspect, thereby also a multi-dimensional interoperability description is provided, facilitating the synchronization of collaborating systems on each level. Similar to for example ARIS and OMG's MDA three levels are used:\n"}

{"id": "14944660", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14944660", "title": "Edward Avery McIlhenny", "text": "Edward Avery McIlhenny\n\nEdward Avery \"Ned\" McIlhenny (29 March 1872 – 8 August 1949), son of Tabasco brand pepper sauce tycoon Edmund McIlhenny, was an American businessman, explorer, bird bander and conservationist. He established a private wildlife refuge around his family estate on Avery Island and helped in preserving a large coastal marshland in Louisiana as a bird refuge. He also introduced several exotic plants into Jungle Gardens, his private wildlife garden. McIlhenny is sometimes blamed for the introduction of exotic coypu into Louisiana where they are a major ecological problem although it is now known that he was neither the first to introduce their farming in the area or to release them into the wild.\n\nBorn in 1872 at Avery Island, Louisiana, where the families of his father Edmund McIlhenny and his mother Mary Eliza Avery had lived since 1813, McIlhenny was educated privately before attending Wyman's Military Academy in Illinois and Dr. Holbrook's Military School in Sing Sing (now Ossining), New York. In 1892, McIlhenny enrolled at Lehigh University, where he joined the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, but he dropped out of school to join Frederick Cook's 1894 Arctic expedition as an ornithologist. The expedition ended when their ship \"Miranda\" was wrecked off Greenland. In 1897, he financed his own Arctic expedition to Point Barrow, Alaska, where he leased an old government station, built to accommodate 100 men in an emergency and now owned by the Pacific Steam Whaling Company. During the famous rescue of a stranded Japanese whaling fleet, McIlhenny refused to house any of the rescued sailors except a few officers, including the Japanese adventurer and entrepreneur Jujiro Wada. He did provide cotton intended for taxidermic purposes for bedding.\n\nOn his return from the second Arctic expedition, he married Mary Givens Matthews, daughter of William Henry Matthews and Mary Campbell Given, on June 6, 1900, in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nIn 1898, Edward's elder brother John enlisted in the U.S. Army, eventually joining the Rough Riders. Edward took over the family business, McIlhenny's Son Corporation, which produced Tobasco, the hot-pepper sauce invented by his father some 30 years previously. Edward renamed the firm McIlhenny Company and began to expand, modernize, and standardized sauce production. He also experimented with new ways of promoting the world-famous product, such as advertising on radio.\n\nIn 1927, McIlhenny replaced the cork-topped Tabasco bottles used for nearly six decades with the now-ubiquitous screw-top bottle. He also redesigned the iconic Tabasco diamond logo trademark, largely creating the version known today.\n\nIn 1939, McIlhenny and the governor of Louisiana Richard Leche were sued for transgressions in the issue of a contract to McIlhenny for the landscaping of Louisiana State University campus. An amount of $27,351.01 was claimed but nobody was convicted after the Supreme Court held that special skills did not require competitive bidding and that services worth that amount had been delivered.\n\nIn a venture unrelated to Tabasco sauce, McIlhenny also operated a nutria (\"Myocastor coypus\") farm on Avery Island from 1938 until his death. The nutria introduction began in collaboration with Armand P. Daspit, director of the Louisiana Department of Conservation's Fur and Wild Life Division who approached McIlhenny after reading a bulletin on them from Buenos Aires. Another couple, Susan and Captain H. Conrad Brote began a nutria farm at St. Tammany Parish from around 1933. The captain served on merchant ships running between New Orleans and Buenos Aires. Their farm did well but there were no sales and they let out their nutria even before McIlhenny had begun his operations from locally acquired stock. Another nutria farm was also begun around the same time in St. Bernard Parish from where McIlhenny's first nutria were obtained in 1938. McIlhenny's nutria farm quickly grew too large for their one-acre pen and he was surprised both by their prolific breeding and the difficulties in confining them to their pens. On June 1, 1940 he freed about twenty nutria. In 1945 he released all his nutria claiming that it would help establish a fur industry in Louisiana. At the time, state and federal agencies advocated these releases. They believed nutria would provide a profitable new fur resource and help manage the spread of overly abundant plants such as water hyacinth and alligator weed.\n\nAfter these releases, the feral population became unmanageable, and its overwhelmingly harmful impact on Louisiana's wetlands became apparent. Nutria feed on vegetation that is crucial to sustaining Louisiana's coastline and protecting the state's sugarcane and rice fields. By 1960, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries estimated the nutria population along coastal regions to exceed 20 million. The latest report from the U.S. Department of the Interior estimates that of Louisiana's coastal wetlands are currently being occupied by nutria.\n\nAfter the first Arctic expedition, he noticed on returning to Avery Island, a great decline in the number of egrets. This led him to conduct experiments in captive breeding. McIlhenny founded the Bird City wildfowl refuge on Avery Island around 1895, which helped to save the snowy egret from extinction. In 1910, McIlhenny and Charles Willis Ward bought of marshland and later an additional ; on November 4, 1911, they dedicated the marsh to the state of Louisiana as a wildlife refuge. McIlhenny persuaded Mrs Russell Sage to purchase of Marsh Island on July 22, 1912, and the Rockefeller Foundation to acquire an additional nearby. This created a bird reserve of about .\n\nMcIlhenny was keen to study the birds on his estate and began bird ringing in 1912, initially using his own bands made of tin and lead on ducks, but he received few recoveries. In February 1916, he began to use bands issued by the American Bird Banding Association. Over 22 years, he banded more than 189,298 birds. Based on his ringing studies he camed to the conclusion that sex-ratios in ducks were skewed in the wild with males surviving to a greater age than females. Later studies based on McIlhenny's ringing data have yielded considerable information on the movements of black vultures.\n\nIn 1941, he wrote on the potential extinction of the ivory-billed woodpecker, noting its presence in his estate on Avery Island and suggesting that the destruction of old growth forests was key to its demise. The subspecies of white-tailed deer on Avery Island was named after McIlhenny as \"Odocoileus virginianus mcilhennyi\" by Frederic W. Miller in 1928.\n\nMcIlhenny used his personal estate, known as Jungle Gardens, to propagate both Louisiana-native and imported plant varieties, including azaleas, irises, camellias, papyrus, and bamboo. He wrote numerous academic articles, mainly about birds and reptiles, oversaw the publication in English of two European botanical treatises, and edited Charles L. Jordan's unfinished manuscript \"The Wild Turkey and Its Hunting\" (a book often mistakenly attributed to McIlhenny). He supported the equality of women but suggested that there were evolutionary handicaps standing in the way. He also wrote books about alligators (in which he claimed to have shot the longest American alligator 19 feet long), egrets, and African-American gospel music, including:\n\n\nMcIlhenny died in 1949, three years after suffering a debilitating stroke; he is buried on Avery Island. Today, Jungle Gardens and Bird City continue to serve as havens for bird and plant species; they are also popular tourist destinations. Furthermore, the nearly of coastal marshland he helped to set aside as wildfowl refuges continue to exist as state wildlife areas. McIlhenny's illustrated and written documentation of plant and animal life on Avery Island was donated as a collection to Louisiana State University. The E. A. McIlhenny Collection of natural history books at Louisiana State University is named in his honor.\n\n"}

As a non-partisan trade group, it selects a small number of Congressional races in each election cycle (typically two) and encourages their members to donate directly to these campaigns. \" .\n\nThe organization is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah and has over 15,000 members. They are led by an executive committee including bank executives and bank association executives, advised by a Board of bank executivess from each state, and an Advisory Council of bank association leaders. Their membership and leadership includes execs affiliated with the American Bankers Association, Independent Community Bankers of America, and other industry groups.\n\nDuring the 2012 senate elections, the group came out in support of Dean Heller, a former banker in Nevada. They also supported Scott Brown in the Senate race in Massachusetts against CFPB creator Elizabeth Warren. Although Warren won in Massachusetts, F Heller won a narrow victory over Congresswoman Shelley Berkley in Nevada.\n\nIn the 2014 senate elections, the group helped direct over 1,000 donations totaling over $500,000 to Cory Gardner in Colorado and another $500,000 plus to Joni Ernst in Iowa. Both Gardner's opponent Sen. Mark Udall and Ernst's opponent Rep. Bruce Braley were defenders of the Dodd-Frank Act and advocated for increased expansion of credit unions. Ernst and Gardner both won on Election Day.\n\nWhen first announced in 2012, Friends of Traditional Banking was described by \"Salon\" as a \"smokescreen of a sobriquet,\" and that it was primarily an effort to revoke \"a key provision of Dodd-Frank known as the Volcker Rule\" while the Huffington Post said it was part of the banks' \"plan for world domination.\" National Journal commented that \"the bankers' non-super PAC super PAC\" was \"taking a novel approach\" that promised to be both effective and transparent.\n\nAfter the 2014 elections, Politico commented that \"The industry went to bat in a big way for Gardner, routing him money through Friends of Traditional Banking,\".\n\n"}
{"id": "41069761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41069761", "title": "Habitica", "text": "Habitica\n\nHabitica, formerly HabitRPG, is an online task management application run by HabitRPG, Inc. Unlike most task management programs, Habitica takes the form of a role-playing game. Habitica is an open source project.\n\nHabitica is a self-improvement web application with game mechanics overlaid to help the player keep track of and remain motivated to achieve their goals.\n\nThe game is laid out in the form of an RPG, in which the player collects items such as gold and armor to become more powerful. Rewards are achieved through maintaining real-life goals, in the form of \"Habits\", \"Dailies\" and \"To-Dos\".\n\nIn Habitica, \"Habits\" are long-term goals which are utilized to change a person's habits. These \"Habits\" can be set to either 'positive' or 'negative', or both. For example:\n\nIf a user completes a positive Habit often, it will turn green. This signifies that they are doing a good job following their Habit. On the other hand, if a user performs a negative Habit often, it will start to turn red and do increasing damage to their health. When players accrue enough experience points, they gain a level, which restores their health.\n\nHabitica uses \"Dailies\" to track habits that the user wants to complete in a known, scheduled, and repeatable fashion. Dailies are completed by ticking a check box: the user sets their Dailies in advance, and checks off what they have completed during their day. Completed Dailies give the user experience and gold; Dailies that fail to be completed by the end of the day result in a loss of health.\n\n\"To-Dos\" are one-time tasks that can be added or deleted. When a user completes a To-Do, they gain experience. The To-Do then disappears (it can later be found under the 'Complete' To-Dos tab). Unlike Habits and Dailies, To-Dos will never cause the user to lose health: the To-Do just becomes more valuable over time (it gives more experience and gold once completed).\n\nA major part of Habitica is the role-playing aspect. A role-playing game is one in which a player takes on the role of another person or character. In Habitica, the user takes control of a character that they design themselves. The user can level up and unlock new features. However, upon death, various items and a level are lost.\n\nThe player can customize their own character (also known as an avatar) using various customization options such as hair, skin color and shirts. The armor and swords that a player buys when equipped also provide an attribute bonus. Some of the art in Habitica is sourced from BrowserQuest.\n\nThe class system is another feature adding complexity to the role-playing aspect of Habitica. Players can choose from one of four classes, each of which have different armor available, as well as different primary and secondary character attributes that affect gameplay.\n\nDepending on how well a player completes their Habits, Dailies, and To-Dos, they either gain \"experience\" or lose \"health\". When a player obtains enough experience, they gain a level, but losing all their health will cause their character to die, and be set back a level. The higher the level the player is, the more features they have access to.\n\nWhen a player completes a Habit, Daily, or To-Do, they gain Gold with the amount depending on the difficulty of the task. Gold can be used to buy \"rewards\" - which can either be user-defined, real life rewards, or equipment that can give boosts in-game. Gold used to be split into Gold and Silver, with hundred Silver making up one Gold\n\nWhen checking off items, sometimes the player will receive an item. The items that can be found are eggs, color potions, and food. The player can combine these to collect a set of 90 pets, which they can display beside their avatar, and 90 mounts, which their avatar can ride. Additional pets and mounts can be obtained during special events and by completing quests.\n\nPlayers can band together in parties to complete quests. Players can also join guilds and participate in challenges made by other players, where the person with the most consistency in performing a task wins an achievement. Players can compete with friends and strangers, as well as collaborate and focus on accountability. In parties and guilds, as well as in the community-wide Tavern, players can communicate with one another via chat.\n\nThere are four seasonal events called Grand Galas that happen each year in Habitica. Past Galas have involved new quests, special items such as limited edition equipment and avatar customization options, and bosses for the whole community to fight together. Other holidays, such as Valentine's Day and April Fools’ Day, are also celebrated.\n\nAn official mobile application named Habitica is available for the Android and iOS operating systems. These mobile applications are replacements for the deprecated mobile apps named HabitRPG, which were released as promised after the $25,000 Kickstarter fund goal was reached.\n\nIn reviewing the site, Alan Henry wrote for Lifehacker that \"while it doesn’t offer the advanced features that many other to-do apps have, it’s certainly a blast to use, and really addictive\". Kelsey Adams wrote for CNET that Habitica (then known as HabitRPG) 'had [her] at RPG', and describes 'how much more compelling a game can be than reality to those of us whose brains are bent that way'.\n\nTyler Renelle originally created HabitRPG to help with his own habits, having been inspired by the self-help books \"The Power of Habit\" and \"The Now Habit\". The earliest version of HabitRPG was a Google Docs spreadsheet with color-coded cell formulae.\n\nAs the community of HabitRPG users grew, Renelle reached out to Siena Leslie and Vicky Hsu. Leslie and Hsu became cofounders of HabitRPG, Inc., which was formally incorporated as a company in 2014.\n\nOn July 31, 2015, the website and apps were renamed to Habitica, after the land where players’ adventures take place. The change was made because some users found the name HabitRPG confusing or difficult to remember. The company name remained HabitRPG, Inc.\n\nIn addition to participating in the website and apps’ social aspects, the community has been involved in helping with and improving Habitica.\n\nCommunity volunteers contribute to Habitica in various ways, such as by creating pixel art, translating text, creating music and sound effects, writing blog posts to promote Habitica, editing the wiki, resolving bugs, implementing new features, and answering new users’ questions.\n\nStarting on January 11, 2013, Renelle started a campaign on fund-raising site Kickstarter to improve development of the application with a goal of $25,000. The goal was surpassed: $41,191 was raised by a total of 2,817 people.\n\nHabitica's application programming interface (API) allows programmers to create third-party applications, extensions, and other tools that interface with Habitica.\n\n\n"}

Members are typically primary securities and/or futures regulators in a national jurisdiction or the main financial regulator from each country. Its mandate is to:\n\nIOSCO has members from over 100 different countries, who regulate more than 95% of the world's securities markets. It has a permanent secretariat in Madrid, Spain.\n\nIOSCO was born in 1983 from the transformation of its ancestor the \"Inter-American Regional Association\" (created in 1974) into a truly global cooperative. This decision to expand the organisation beyond the Americas was made at the annual gathered in Quito, Ecuador, in April 1983. At the same time, the organisation was renamed to IOSCO to reflect the expanded membership beyond North and South America. Securities regulators from France, Indonesia, Korea, and the United Kingdom were the first agencies to join from outside the Americas. The IOSCO July 1986 Paris Annual Conference was the first to take place outside of the American continents and on that occasion a decision was made to create a permanent General Secretariat for the Organisation. One remnant of its early inter-American roots is that IOSCO's \"official\" languages are English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese.\n\nIn 1998 IOSCO started work on a number of important policies that led to broader set of guidelines. However it was the September 11, 2001 attacks as well as a series of large global financial scandals that started with Enron and including Worldcom, Parmalat, and Vivendi that brought urgency to this work and heralded IOSCO's evolution from an international “talk shop”, where little of substance was accomplished, to a serious international organisation with a real impact on the securities regulation. At the 1999 conference in Lisbon, it was decided to have a permanent headquarters for the administrative General Secretariat and that it should be based in Madrid.\n\nIn 2002 IOSCO adopted a multilateral memorandum of understanding (IOSCO MMoU) designed to facilitate crossborder enforcement and exchange of information among the international community of securities regulators. Then in 2005 IOSCO MMoU become the benchmark for international cooperation among securities regulators.\n\nAs of February 2018, IOSCO had 218 members. IOSCO members are divided into three main categories:\n\n\nThe organisation is made up of a number of committees that meet several times a year at different locations around the world supported by a permanent administrative General Secretariat.\n\nAdministratively, IOSCO is run by a General Secretariat based in Madrid, Spain. IOSCO’s current Secretary General is Paul P. Andrews, who started his renewable three-year term in March 2016. Previously, he served as the Vice President and Managing Director of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) a self-regulatory organization in the United States.\n\nThe IOSCO Board is IOSCO's governing and standard-setting body. It is composed of 33 securities regulators; Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission CEO Ashley Ian Alder is the IOSCO Board Chair (he also chairs the Asia-Pacific Regional Committee). He is supported by two Vice Chairs, Ranjit Ajit Singh, Chair of the Securities Commission Malaysia (who chairs the Growth and Emerging Markets Committee, IOSCO's largest sub-committee) and Jean-Paul Servais, Chair of Belgium's Financial Services and Markets Authority (who chairs the European Regional Committee as well).\n\nIOSCO has four regional committees:\n\nThe Technical Committee has been described as the one involving the most \"grunt work\". In short, it is made up of 16 of the larger securities agencies that regulate more developed markets. It is \"self-constituting\" in the sense that it determines which countries will be a member and it also determines procedures and agendas. In 1991, former SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden was elected Chair of the technical committee and implemented reforms that gave it a \"new vigor and a new resolution\" that \"bespoke an organization confident of its footing and its mission\".\n\nIOSCO is a member of, participates as an observer in, or coordinates with a number of other organisations. One of its most important relationships is with the Joint Forum of international financial regulators. IOSCO, along with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, make up the Joint Forum.\n\nThe IOSCO MOUs are considered the primary instruments to facilitate crossborder cooperation, reduce global systemic risk, protect investors, and ensure fair and efficient securities markets.\n\nAdditionally, IOSCO is a member of, participates as an observer in, or coordinates with a number of other international organisations, including the OECD, FSB, Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, IASB, PIOB, IMF, World Bank, and European Commission.\n\nIOSCO adopted in 1998 a comprehensive set of \"Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation\" (IOSCO Principles). These continue to be developed and expanded. IOSCO recommends all its members to adopt these and helps its members assess the level of compliance with the principles. These include;\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22592282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22592282", "title": "Machine Design", "text": "Machine Design\n\nMachine Design () is an American trade magazine and Web site serving the OEM engineering market. Its print issues reach qualified design engineers and engineering managers twice a month.\n\nKey technologies covered include computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM), electrical and electronics, fastening and joining, fluid power, manufacturing, engineered materials, mechanical engineering, and motion control.\nToday, \"Machine Design\" is owned by Penton Media Inc., and has editorial offices based in Cleveland, Ohio, USA. The chief editor is Leland Teschler.\n\nThe inaugural issue of \"Machine Design\" coincided almost exactly with the 1929 stock-market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression. Although the nation was in the economic doldrums, there was significant design development taking place in almost all industrial segments including automotive, aircraft, farm equipment, home appliances, and industrial machinery.\nThe onset of World War II came and brought almost frenetic activity to design engineering at large. After the war, civilian industries thrived. But in the years following the war and into the 1950s the role of design engineer languished, stigmatized by the war effort as the creator of new means of destruction.\n\nEngineering colleges began to feel slighted because doctors, lawyers, and business executives were viewed as having more prestige and professional status than their engineering graduates. Intellectual elites viewed engineering colleges as trade schools, and graduate engineers were said to be nothing more than mechanics or glorified shop hands. In response, engineering schools began to drop courses that lacked academic rigor or had the slightest blue-collar aura.\nThe launch of Sputnik in 1957 again changed the perception of design engineering. The perceived loss of world leadership in air and space technology by the people of the United States set the stage for a considerable renewal of prestige to the engineering discipline. After more than a decade into the Cold War, the public realized science and engineering could play a key role in keeping the Communists at bay. The government unloaded almost limitless supplies of money on high-tech defense industries, and engineering became the career of choice. High salaries and generous perks were lavished on engineers and scientists.\nUnfortunately, Sputnik also accelerated the movement to delete courses on manufacturing and shop practice from the curricula of top schools. The idea was to portray engineers as being more scientist than mechanic. The rocket scientist working on the space program became the image to which most engineers aspired.\n\nThis attitude had a lot to do with framing the editorial policies of \"Machine Design\" through the 1960s. The policies were in tune with what was happening in the largest and most-sophisticated corporations, especially the aircraft and automotive industries, where design engineering and manufacturing engineering were increasingly treated as separate entities having no common interest. Reflecting this, articles selected for \"Machine Design\" were carefully tailored not to have too much of a manufacturing orientation.\n\nStarting in the late 1960s, another shift in American perception was brought about by the growing awareness of overseas manufacturing facilities returning a lower cost product with higher quality. While lower labor rates played a key role in the lower costs, they could not justify the higher reliability of offshore products over those domestically produced. It was soon discovered that those shops with higher quality production realized design and manufacturing engineering were closely intertwined. \"Machine Design\" articles started to reflect this trend. For example, it's believed to be the first industrial trade magazine to run a comprehensive article explaining numerical control machining and how it relates to design engineering.\n\n\"Machine Design\"'s coverage of manufacturing positioned it well when concurrent engineering became the trendy idea in industry. Major corporations suddenly discovered that design and manufacturing were interrelated, and it became vogue to tear down the walls between design and manufacturing engineers.\n\nIn the 1970s, finite-element analysis broke on the industrial scene. Computer-aided design was evolving, and by the 1980s, it was also having a profound impact on design procedures. Computer-aided manufacturing evolved separately, but by 1990 CAD and CAM had merged. In the field of electrical and electronic technology, relay controls were giving way to digital electronics and the microprocessor that led to combining a number of design disciplines into the technologies of mechatronics and motion control.\n\nFor over 80 years, \"Machine Design\" had predicted and led the industrial community spotting trends and fundamental changes in manufacturing operations. Providing an ongoing series of technological overviews interspersed with in-depth tutorials, it kept readers abreast of technologies that were transforming product design. It does this with an editorial staff of degreed engineers possessing industrial experience and obligated to create lucid and interesting articles supported by the intelligent use of graphics.\n\n\n\n[{category:machine design]]"}

Oelrichs first used the masculine \"nom de plume\" Michael Strange to publish her poetry in order to distance her Society reputation from its sometimes erotic content, but it soon became the name under which she presented herself for the remainder of her life.\n\nBorn to Charles May Oelrichs and Blanche de Loosey, Blanche Oelrichs was the youngest of four children. Her Austrian mother was the sister of Emilie de Loosey, wife of Theodore Havemeyer. The family spent summers in Newport, Rhode Island, amidst the Astors, the Vanderbilts, and numerous other wealthy elites of American society during the Gilded Age.\n\nHer sister Natalie, always known as Lily, married and divorced Heinrich Borwin, Duke of Mecklenburg (son of Duke Paul Frederick of Mecklenburg), after the premature death of her first husband Peter Martin of San Francisco. Her brother, Charles de Loosey was the father of Marjorie Oelrichs who was married to band leader Eddy Duchin.\n\nOelrichs was an involved activist for women's suffrage and a writer. French portrait artist Paul Helleu described Strange as the \"most beautiful woman in America.\"\n\nIn 1910, Oelrichs married her first husband Leonard Moorhead Thomas, the son of a prominent Philadelphia banker, with whom she had two children, Leonard Jr. (1911–68) and Robin May Thomas (1915–44). Leonard Moorhead Thomas was a Yale University graduate who had worked in the diplomatic service in Rome and Madrid and served with the United States Army in Europe during World War I, earning the Croix de Guerre. Blanche Oelrichs developed a \"literary urge\" in 1914 when she began creating works of poetry and theatrical plays. Her first collection of poems was published in 1916 under the pen name Michael Strange. Her interests caused a rift with her husband and they divorced in 1919.\n\nThrough her social activities, Strange met renowned actor John Barrymore. They were introduced by actress Cathleen Nesbitt, Barrymore's leading woman in the 1916 production of the play \"Justice\". She continued seeing him for four years; and, after divorcing Thomas, she married Barrymore on August 5, 1920. She was already pregnant with their only child, Diana Blanche Barrymore, who was born on March 3, 1921.\n\nWith drawings provided by John Barrymore, Strange published a book in 1921 titled \"Resurrecting Life\". Her pseudonym was intended to separate her Society family from the erotic content of the volume and its connection to her affair from Barrymore, but instead the vast popularity of the volume led to greater fame and notoriety, and her adaptation of the Strange name permanently. She then turned her writing skills to the creation of theatrical plays including a 1921 Broadway production titled \"Clair de lune\".

It was made into a 1932 movie of the same name in France by director Henri Diamant-Berger.\n\nIn 1921, Strange was among the first to join the Lucy Stone League, an organization that fought for women to preserve their maiden names after marriage.\n\nStrange spent a great deal of time in Paris, France during the next few years while her husband performed abroad. After returning to live in New York, she began acting in live theatre. Her marriage to John Barrymore ended in May 1925. She then joined a summer stock company in Salem, Massachusetts and appeared in two Broadway plays in 1926 and 1927.\n\nAnother book of Strange's poetry was published in 1928 under the title \"Selected poems, by Michael Strange\" and the following year she married a third time to the prominent New York attorney Harrison Tweed who later became Chairman of Sarah Lawrence College. During the second half of the 1930s Strange hosted a poetry and music program on New York radio station WOR that gained a strong audience. In 1940, Strange published her autobiography, \"Who Tells Me True\". In 1942, she and Harrison Tweed divorced, and in 1944 her son Robin died at the age of 29.\n\nStarting in the summer of 1940 until her death, Strange was in a long-term relationship with Margaret Wise Brown, the author of many children's books. The relationship began as something of a mentoring one, but became a romantic relationship and they lived together at 10 Gracie Square beginning in 1943.\n\nStrange was a registered communist and part of the America First Committee's weekly radio show.\n\nHer final professional tour was \"Great Works with Great Music\", a recreation of a radio program she had done previously, in which she read great literature and classical works of music were played.\n\nMichael Strange died from leukemia in 1950 in Boston. She was interred with her son Robin, who had died in 1944, in the Oelrichs' family plot in the Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York. Robin had been buried in Indiana with his predeceased lover, but Strange's will asked for his body to be moved to the rest of the family.\n\nMargaret Wise Brown was made her literary executor. Upon her death two years later, Strange's papers were delivered to Brown's sister Roberta who contacted Diana Barrymore who instructed her to burn them.\n\nIn 1960 her daughter Diana Barrymore died at age 38 after several years of drug and alcohol addiction. Her older son Leonard was married to painter Yvonne Thomas and they had two daughters together, the only grandchildren of Michael Strange.\n\n\n\n"}

The street is one of the oldest streets in Chennai and is believed to be the longest street in the city. Running north–south, the street connects Poonamallee High Road at Park Town in the south with North Wall Road–Old Jail Road Junction at Washermanpet in the north. Running parallel to the Wall Tax Road, another historical thoroughfare in the city, the street passes through thickly populated residential and commercial areas of the historical neighbourhood.\n\nIn the 17th century, a Jewish cemetery was established on the street by a Portuguese Jewish trader, Jacques de Paivia. It was later moved to Lloyd's Road and became the Lloyd's Road Jewish Cemetery.\n\nIn the early 18th century, washers and bleachers employed by the British East India Company for its cloth business settled around the street, given it the name 'Washers' Street'. Several of them were Telugu speaking, followed by the middlemen or dubashes (men who knew two languages), chiefly Telugu-speaking Komutti and Beri Chetties. By the 1740s, Gujarathis and people from the Saurashtra region closely associated with the cloth trade settled down in the area to the west of the street. Soon, the area also became home to Marwaris, who were chiefly pawn brokers and money lenders. Mint Street thus became a confluence of various language speakers, which has remained so till date.\n\nIn 1841–1842, the East India Company moved its coin-making facility to this street, and since then the street became known as Mint Street. Later the mint was converted as the Government Press, which still functions. Next to the Press stood Crown Talkies, one of the city's earliest cinema theatres built by a photographer named Ragupathy Venkaiah, who also built other theatres such as Gaiety and Globe in various parts of the city. The street also housed Muragan Theatre, where \"Kalidasa\", the first Tamil talkie, was released.\n\nThe city's first ticketed Carnatic concert was conducted in this street in the 1880s for a concert by Maha Vaidyanatha Sivan at the Thondaimandalam Thruva Vellalar School, which is now in a dilapidated condition. The concept, however, did not succeed.\n\nIn 1889, the Hindu Theological School was established, where the legendary C. Saraswathi Bai gave her first harikatha performance in 1909, becoming the first woman to do so. The school was visited by Mahatma Gandhi in 1896.\n\nThe street is known for its authentic Rajasthani cuisine, which Marwaris believe is only available in this area.\n\nThe memorial house of savant Ramalinga Swamigal is located near the northern end of the street, in Veerasami Street, a lane off Barracks Street.\n\nThe street houses two historic schools, namely the Tondaimandalam Tuluva Vellalar (TTV) School, founded in 1854, and the Hindu Theological School, founded in 1889. The TTV School was home to one of the earliest music sabhas—the Tondaimandalam Sabha. It was at a meeting of this Sabha at the school in 1905 that the decision to celebrate the Aradhana of Tyagaraja in a grand manner at Thiruvaiyaru was taken by a large group of musicians.\n\nMint Street housed several bhajan centres (\"bhajanai mandirams\"), to nurture the bhajan tradition of Carnatic music, of which at least two still survive. One of these centres has transformed into a temple. Known as the 'Sumai tangi' (load-bearing) Rama temple, it has two exquisite Thanjavur paintings of Rama and Narasimha, which were the original objects of worship before the erection of stone idols. In a talk that Tiger Varadachariar gave over the All India Radio, composers and music publishers Tachur Singaracharlu Brothers organised bhajan sessions at this temple in the 1890s.\nMint Street has several temples dedicated to Lord Ganesha. Kandaswami Temple, dedicated to Lord Murugan, is located on Rasappa Chetty Street, off Mint Street.\n\n"}

It expired on 1 January 2005.\n\nSince the (re)emergence of developing countries as a source of cotton textile production, after the Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution, such as India's Khadi production in the Swadeshi movement initiated by Mahatma Gandhi, cotton production from these countries steadily increased after colonial independence. A number of treaties concerning Short-Term Arrangements regarding International Trade in Cotton Textiles (Geneva, 21 July 1961); Long-Term Arrangement regarding International Trade in Cotton Textiles (Geneva, 9 February 1962 and 15 June 1970), and Arrangement regarding International Trade in Textiles (Geneva, 20 December 1973) attempted to address the issue of what seemed a natural dominance of developing world in cotton textile production at the time. Eventually, the Multi Fibre Agreement was established in 1974.\n\nThe MFA was introduced in 1974 as a short-term measure intended to allow developed countries to adjust to imports from the developing world. Developing countries and countries without a welfare state have a comparative advantage in textile production because it is labor-intensive and their poor social insurance systems allow them low labor costs. According to a World Bank/International Monetary Fund (IMF) study, the system has cost the developing world 27 million jobs and $40 billion a year in lost exports. Developing countries have resisted moves such as a social clause in tariff agreements, to link them to improvements in working conditions.\n\nThe Arrangement was not negative for all developing countries. For example, the European Union (EU) imposed no restrictions or duties on imports from the emerging countries, such as Bangladesh, leading to a massive expansion of the industry.\n\nAt the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Uruguay Round, it was decided to bring the textile trade under the jurisdiction of the World Trade Organization. The Agreement on Textiles and Clothing provided for the gradual dismantling of the quotas that existed under the MFA. This process was completed on 1 January 2005. However, large tariffs remained in place on many textile products.\n\nBangladesh was expected to suffer the most from the ending of the MFA, as it was expected to face more competition, particularly from China. However, this was not the case. It turns out that even in the face of other economic giants, Bangladesh’s labor is \"cheaper than anywhere else in the world.\" While some smaller factories were documented making pay cuts and layoffs, most downsizing was essentially speculative – the orders for goods kept coming even after the MFA expired. In fact, Bangladesh's exports increased in value by about $500 million in 2006.\n\nHowever, poorer countries within the developed world, such as Greece and Portugal, are expected to lose out.\n\nDuring early 2005, textile and clothing exports from China to the West grew by 100% or more in many items, leading the US and EU to cite China's WTO accession agreement allowing them to restrict the rate of growth to 7.5% per year until 2008. In June, China agreed with the EU to limit the rate to 10% for 3 years. No such agreement was reached with the US, which imposed its own import growth quotas of 7.5% instead.\n\nWhen the EU announced their new quotas to replace the lapsed MFA, Chinese manufacturers accelerated their shipping of the goods intended for the European market. This used up a full year's quota almost immediately. As a result, 75 million items of imported Chinese garments were held in European ports in August 2005. A diplomatic resolution was reached at the beginning of September 2005 during Tony Blair's visit to China, putting an end to a situation the UK press had dubbed \"Bra Wars\".\n\n\n"}

The furniture industry in Pakistan has been expanding. Many new furniture companies are now joining the furniture industry. Our handmade furniture is in high demand by high-end customers. Pakistani furniture manufacturers have expertise in this area, due to the type of wood used namely 'sheesham' (rosewood) which adds to this furniture's demand. The leading wood-furniture-making areas of Pakistan are Chiniot, Gujrat, Peshawar, Lahore and Karachi.\n\nConsumer spending increased by an average of 26% - per the Bloomberg’s report, which was published on November 21, 2013. It’s not only that the Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) companies get benefits from increased consumer spending; the furniture manufacturers also benefit from it.\n\nAs per World Trade Organization’s statistics, the wooden furniture exports of Pakistan reportedly amounted to almost $51 million in the calendar year (CY) 2011. Whereas, in 2009-2010 the furniture exports of Pakistan ranged between $25 million to $30 million (excluding undocumented exports of an approximate amount of $10 million). However, according to the All Pakistan Furniture Exporters Association (APFEA) founder Mr. Turhan Baig Muhammad, these exports represent a very small portion of the total furniture business of the country. According to him, the local furniture market is almost 50 times stronger than that of the exports. Keeping this in view, the approximate total furniture sale of the country is more than $2.5 billion. \n\nTotal world trade of furniture is estimated to be $23.2 billion. Wood furniture accounts for 77 percent, metal furniture 17 percent, and plastic furniture 6 percent of the total. In 2010, the share of Pakistan in the international furniture market is trivial. Even though the country takes pride in having a history of craftsmanship, it does not share a significant position in the international wood furniture market.\n\nDomestic furniture industry is suffering because furniture exports to Pakistan from some other countries have increased, whereas, the high cost of furniture-making business is increasing problems for the local furniture manufacturers. The prices of raw materials which includes timber, colour paints, chipboard, polish materials, and foams have increased manifold. Due to unchecked deforestation, timber production of the country is also suffering.\nWood furniture industry of Pakistan is categorised as being small because old obsolete machinery is used in this industry, which is the reason for higher cost and low output. Traditional wood furniture in Pakistan is heavy and bulky. Pakistani furniture industry needs to go to light-weight and moveable furniture to be exported to the world market where demand is high to meet the needs of offices, shopping malls, buildings and shopping plazas.\n\nPakistan furniture council urges the government to bar furniture imports. Mostly, office furniture, bar stools, visitor chairs are imported from other countries and there is a huge demand for these products in Pakistan. \n\nA large amount of the Pakistan’s furniture demand is met by Chinioti furniture. Chiniot, a city in Pakistan, is acknowledged for producing \"beautifully carved wood furniture and handicrafts\".\n\nThe \"Faisalabad Industrial Estate Development and Management Company\" (FIEDMC) has plans, in 2014, to set up a furniture city in the industrial area of Faisalabad, Pakistan. According to a news source, wood seasoning plants will be established to manufacture international standard furniture.\n\nIn this regard, FIEDMC has joined hands with the European-based IKEA company, the world's largest furniture retailer that designs and sells ready-to-assemble furniture, for the development of the furniture city in Faisalabad. The same report tells that by this initiative about 200,000 job opportunities will be created.\n\nLocal furniture manufacturers are using internet to market their products. They also have started to use social media channels to market their business activities.\n\n\"Pakistan needs to bring improvements to its furniture industry to increase the total revenue generated from this industry\", said the Pakistani Federal Minister for Commerce, \"Khurram Dastagir\". The country does not lack resources and skills when it comes to manufacturing quality furniture. However, there is a need to exploit these resources in order to expand the furniture industry of Pakistan and increase international trade and foreign exchange income from it. The market beyond Pakistani borders is substantially larger tha the local market.\n\n"}

It is classified as a restricted true endowment fund for governments and non-profit organizations. Put simply, a permanent fund may be used to generate and disburse money to those entitled to receive payments by qualification or agreement, as in the case of Alaska citizens or residents that satisfy the rules for payment from their permanent fund from State oil revenues. It was first introduced through GASB Statement 34. The name of the fund comes from the purpose of the fund: a sum of equity used to permanently generate payments to maintain some financial obligation. Also, a fund can only be classified as a permanent fund if the money is used to report the status of a restricted financial resource. The resource is restricted in the sense that only earnings from the resource are used and not the principal. For example, a fund can be classified as a permanent fund if it is being used to pay for accounting services for a perpetual endowment of a government-run cemetery or financial endowments towards a government-run library.\n\nA common misconception is that permanent funds are required for special-purpose government entities that solely engage in business-type activities. However, this is not the case. According to Statement 34, that special-purpose government entity needs only to report the net balance of the restricted resources.\n\n\n"}

In other words, productive efficiency occurs when a good or a service is produced at the lowest possible cost.

An equilibrium may be productively efficient without being allocatively efficient— i.e. it may result in a distribution of goods where social welfare is not maximized. It is one type of economic efficiency.\n\nProductive efficiency requires that all firms operate using best-practice technological and managerial processes. By improving these processes, an economy or business can extend its production possibility frontier outward, so that efficient production yields more output than previously.\n\nProductive inefficiency, with the economy operating below its production possibilities frontier, can occur because the productive inputs physical capital and labor are underutilized—that is, some capital or labor is left sitting idle—or because these inputs are allocated in inappropriate combinations to the different industries that use them.\n\nIn long-run equilibrium for perfectly competitive markets, productive efficiency occurs at the base of the average total cost curve—i.e. where marginal cost equals average total cost—for each good.\n\nDue to the nature and culture of monopolistic companies, they may not be productively efficient because of X-inefficiency, whereby companies operating in a monopoly have less of an incentive to maximize output due to lack of competition.

{"id": "4213088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4213088", "title": "Secured loan", "text": "Secured loan\n\nA secured loan is a loan in which the borrower pledges some asset (e.g. a car or property) as collateral for the loan, which then becomes a secured debt owed to the creditor who gives the loan. The debt is thus secured against the collateral, and if the borrower defaults, the creditor takes possession of the asset used as collateral and may sell it to regain some or all of the amount originally loaned to the borrower. An example is the foreclosure of a home. From the creditor's perspective, that is a category of debt in which a lender has been granted a portion of the bundle of rights to specified property. If the sale of the collateral does not raise enough money to pay off the debt, the creditor can often obtain a deficiency judgment against the borrower for the remaining amount.\n\nThe opposite of secured debt/loan is unsecured debt, which is not connected to any specific piece of property. Instead, the creditor may satisfy the debt only against the borrower, rather than the borrower's collateral and the borrower. Generally speaking, secured debt may attract lower interest rates than unsecured debt because of the added security for the lender; however, credit risk (e.g. credit history, and ability to repay) and expected returns for the lender are also factors affecting rates. The term \"secured loan\" is used in the United Kingdom, but the United States more commonly uses \"secured debt\".\n\nThere are two purposes for a loan secured by debt. In the first purpose, by extending the loan through securing the debt, the creditor is relieved of most of the financial risks involved because it allows the creditor to take ownership of the property in the event that the debt is not properly repaid. In exchange, this permits the second purpose where the debtors may receive loans on more favorable terms than that available for unsecured debt, or to be extended credit under circumstances when credit under terms of unsecured debt would not be extended at all. The creditor may offer a loan with attractive interest rates and repayment periods for the secured debt.\n\n\nBefore the global economic crisis of 2006, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) estimated that the UK secured loan market had a net worth of £7,000,000,000. However, following the close of Lehman Brothers' sub-prime lender BNC Mortgage in August 2007, the UK's most prominent secured loan providers were forced to withdraw from the market.\n\n\nThe United States is the global leader in security interest law with respect to personal property; in the 1940s, it was the first country to develop and enact the notion of a \"unified\" security interest. That concept has since spread to many countries around the world after it became evident that it is one of the reasons for why the United States has the strongest economy in the world. For example, to raise money, American ranchers could pledge personal property like cattle in certain ways that historically were impossible or very difficult in Uruguay or most other developing countries. However, US law with respect to security interests in real property is still extremely chaotic and non-uniform. The Uniform Law Commission in the 1970s and 1980s worked hard to develop uniform acts to clean it up but the project was a catastrophic failure.\n\nIn the case of real estate, the most common form of secured debt is the lien. Liens may either be voluntarily created, as with a mortgage, or involuntarily created, such as a mechanics lien. A mortgage may only be created with the express consent of the title owner, without regard to other facts of the situation. In contrast, the primary condition required to create a mechanics lien is that real estate is somehow improved through the work or materials provided by the person filing a mechanics lien. Although the rules are complex, consent of the title owner to the mechanics lien itself is not required.\n\nIn the case of personal property, the most common procedure for securing the debt is regulated under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). This uniform act provides a relatively uniform interstate system of forms and public filing of documents by which the creditor establishes the priority of their security interest in the property of the debtor. \n\nIn the event that the underlying debt is not properly paid, the creditor may decide to foreclose the interest in order to take the property. Generally, the law that allows the secured debt to be made also provides a procedure whereby the property will be sold at public auction, or through some other means of sale. The law commonly also provides a right of redemption, whereby a debtor may arrange for late payment of the debt but keep the property.\n\nDebt can become secured by a contractual agreement, statutory lien, or judgment lien. Contractual agreements can be secured by either a purchase money security interest (PMSI) loan, where the creditor takes a security interest in the items purchased (i.e. vehicle, furniture, electronics); or, a non-purchase money security interest (NPMSI) loan, where the creditor takes a security interest in items that the debtor already owns.\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1967, the organization's stated goal is \"to change the world by developing leaders for a free society.\" TFAS is a conservative organization specializing in the free market. It has professional associations with conservative organisations like the State Policy Network and Charles Koch Institute and receives regular donations.\n\nIn 1967, Charles Edison took the first steps toward establishing the institution that is known today as The Fund for American Studies. Edison was a former governor of New Jersey, Secretary of the Navy and son of inventor Thomas Alva Edison.\n\nConcerned about an eroding confidence in the American system of government, Edison recruited Walter H. Judd, David R. Jones, Marvin Liebman, and William F. Buckley, Jr., to build a program that would educate college students about American government, politics, and economics.\n\nOn February 6, 1967, the group incorporated the Charles Edison Youth Fund. In 1969 Governor Edison died suddenly. To honor him and carry on his mission, the organization was renamed the Charles Edison Memorial Youth Fund. In 1985 the organization was renamed again to its present-day title, The Fund for American Studies. In the summer of 1970, the Edison Fund organized the inaugural Institute on Comparative Political and Economic Systems. Fifty-seven students attended the first Institute.\n\nThe Fund for American Studies sponsors 11 collegiate academic programs. Nine Institutes are held each summer in Washington, D.C., the Czech Republic, and Hong Kong.

A trade transaction requires a seller of goods and services as well as a buyer. Various intermediaries such as banks and financial institutions can facilitate these transactions by financing the trade.\n\nWhile a seller (or exporter) can require the purchaser (an importer) to prepay for goods shipped, the purchaser (importer) may wish to reduce risk by requiring the seller to document the goods that have been shipped. Banks may assist by providing various forms of support. For example, the importer's bank may provide a letter of credit to the exporter (or the exporter's bank) providing for payment upon presentation of certain documents, such as a bill of lading. The exporter's bank may make a loan (by advancing funds) to the exporter on the basis of the export contract.\n\nOther forms of trade finance can include Documentary Collection, Trade Credit Insurance, Finetrading, Factoring or Forfaiting. Some forms are specifically designed to supplement traditional financing.\n\nSecure trade finance depends on verifiable and secure tracking of physical risks and events in the chain between exporter and importer. The advent of new information and communication technologies allows the development of risk mitigation models which have developed into advance finance models. This allows very low risk of advance payment given to the Exporter, while preserving the Importer's normal payment credit terms and without burdening the importer's balance sheet. As trade transactions become more flexible and increase in volume, demand for these technologies has grown.\n\nBanks and financial institutions offer the following products and services in their trade finance branches.\n\nBank guarantee has various types like\n1.

With vacuum frying it is easier to maintain natural colors and flavours of the finished product. Due to the lower temperatures applied (approx. ), the formation of suspected carcinogen acrylamide is significantly lower than in standard atmospheric fryers, where the frying temperature is approx. . The fat absorption of the products is also reported to be lower than in atmospheric fryers. In South East Asia (mainly Philippines, Thailand, China and Indonesia) batch type vacuum fryers are mainly used for the production of fruit chips. However, these machines are only appropriate for relatively small production companies.\n\nFor larger production quantities, continuous vacuum fryers are available. In these installations, the vacuum frying pan is installed in a stainless steel vacuum tube. The infeed of the raw product is carried out through a rotary airlock.\nDepending on the application, the frying pan itself is designed to meet the different product specifications. A transport belt takes the finished product out of the fryer and towards the outfeed system. A lock chamber at the exit of the vacuum tube prevents air from entering the vacuum zone, and a belt system takes the product from one zone to another.\n\nThe vacuum is created by vacuum pumps, and the whole system is controlled by a programmable logic controller.\n\nIn batch fryers, the frying oil has to be replaced quite often as it is sensitive to temperature changes. Continuous vacuum fryers lead to a longer lifetime of the frying oil and therefore lower the production costs. Vacuum fryers can also reduce oil content in fried foods. The amount of reduced oil content, usually 1–3%, depends on the type of vacuum fryer.\n\n"}

Printing the letters, he contested their authenticity. He also edited John of Fordun's \"Scotichronicon\" (1759).\n\nHe was the eldest son of John Goodall, a farmer in Banffshire. He was educated at King's College, Old Aberdeen, which he entered in 1723, but left without taking a degree. In 1730 he obtained employment in the Advocates' Library, Edinburgh, and in 1735 became sub-librarian.\n\nGoodall died in poverty 28 July 1766.\n\nWalter Goodall aided the principal librarian Thomas Ruddiman in the compilation of the catalogue of the Advocates' Library, printed in 1742.\n\nIn 1753 Goodall edited a new issue of the garbled \"Memoirs of the Affairs of Scotland\", originally published by David Crawford. His interest in the partisan \"Memoirs\" was connected with the favourable representation they contained of the career of Queen Mary. He planned to write her life, and published in 1754, in two volumes, an \"Examination of the Letters said to be written by Mary Queen of Scots to James, Earl of Bothwell\". This work presaged the apologist period of the literature relating to the queen.\n\nIn 1754 also, Goodall published an edition, with emendations, of Scot of Scotstarvet's \"Staggering State of Scots Statesmen\", and an edition of James Balfour, Lord Pittendreich's \"Practicks\", with preface and life. He assisted Robert Keith in the preparation of his \"New Catalogue of Scottish Bishops\", for which he supplied the preliminary account of the Culdees. He denied that the Scotia of the early writers was Ireland (not Scotland), and that those first termed Scoti were really emigrants from Ireland; he affirmed that Ireland's other ancient name Ierne belonged also to Scotland. The \"glacialis Ierne\", which, according to Claudian, wept for her slain Scots, was in his opinion the valley of Strathearn, the seat of an ancient Celtic earldom.\n\nGoodall published in 1759 an edition of Fordun's \"Scotichronicon\", with a Latin introduction on the antiquities of Scotland, and a dissertation on the marriage of Robert III.
