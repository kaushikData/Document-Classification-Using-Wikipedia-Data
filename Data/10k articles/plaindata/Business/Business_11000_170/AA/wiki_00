{"id": "34148711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34148711", "title": "1993 Cherbourg incident", "text": "1993 Cherbourg incident\n\nThe 1993 Cherbourg incident were a series of maritime incidents which took place from 26 March to 2 April 1993 between the British Royal Navy and French fishermen as a result of a fishing rights dispute in and around the Channel Islands waters.\n\nThe tensions around the Channel Islands waters rose high since September 1992, when the European Union (EU) recognised a six-mile British limit for exclusive fishing rights around the islands. Until then, British and French trawlers operated in the zone without restrictions. The agreement left a three-mile limit from the coastline where only Jersey trawlers could fish, between the three-mile and the six-mile for any British-flagged boat and an outer area between the six-mile and the 12-mile limit where only British and French fishing boats could operate.\n\nThe first incident took place on 26 March, when two fishing inspectors from the Channel Islands were illegally taken on the trawler \"Impatiens\" to the French port of Barneville-Carteret, after the French fishing boat was challenged by the British fishery vessel HMS \"Orkney\" from Guernsey, which confiscated her pots. The inspectors were rescued some hours later by a French coastguard vessel. On 28 March 1993, HMS \"Blazer\" was paying a visit to Cherbourg when the local fishermen learned that a boat from their fleet, the \"La Calypso\", had been stopped at sea by a British minesweeper, HMS \"Brocklesby\". The captain of the \"La Calypso\" refused to submit and set out for Cherbourg with three British fishery protection servicemen on board. A French port vessel later returned the personnel to Royal Navy control. Eight French trawlers subsequently surrounded the \"Blazer\" at 3:00 pm and angry fishermen boarded the ship. According to witnesses, HMS \"Blazer\" was seized while manoeuvring outside the port and sailed to Cherbourg harbour by the intruders. Her crew of 16 were forced to remain below the deck for three hours, while the ship's White Ensign was burned. French authorities subsequently put an end to the situation and forcibly expelled the fishermen from \"Blazer\" and placed them under arrest. The French Navy, meanwhile, dispatched the patrol boat \"Coriander\" to Cherbourg. On 29 March a flotilla of 36 French trawlers steamed up to Saint Peter Port in Guernsey, where a preliminary deal was agreed. After the first incidents, the Royal Navy deployed unarmed Royal Marines to conduct any future similar law enforcement operations. The marines were from 40 Commando, based at Taunton in Somerset. The \"La Calypso\" was eventually caught by the fishery vessel HMS \"Jersey\" and her master was put under arrest in Guernsey on 2 April 1993. The skipper, Michel Mesnage, was released on bail on 3 April. A new incident took place on 30 June 1993, when the Guernsey-based trawler \"Sara P\" was seized by the French Navy, and had her pots confiscated.\n\nA spokeswoman for the French fishermen accused the Royal Navy of \"severe provocation\", while the British minister of Agriculture, John Gummer, stated that \"The rule of law must be upheld. I have always emphasised the need for fisheries regulations to be properly enforced throughout the EC. The regulations are there to conserve fish and the long-term interests of the fishermen themselves.\" The British Fisheries junior Minister, David Curry, claimed that the conflict was caused by the French authorities' failure to properly inform their fishermen about the agreement sanctioned by the EU in 1992, and the French legislative election, which in practice left no French government to deal with at the time of the incidents. The British Agriculture Minister had met his elected French counterpart on 1 April, and they had agreed that the 1992 EU decision should be enforced. The French government condemned the fishermen's actions. British and Cherbourg fishermen signed an informal agreement on 5 April, on the first day since the beginning of the crisis, that boats from England and the islands were allowed to unload their catch in France.\n\nA definitive agreement regarding fishing around the Channel Islands and the Contentin peninsula and Brittany was reached after an exchange of notes in Paris, on 16 August 1994.\n\n"}

{"id": "35597035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35597035", "title": "Alexander Allan (ship owner)", "text": "Alexander Allan (ship owner)\n\nCaptain Alexander \"Sandy\" Allan (26 February 1780 – 18 March 1854), was the Scottish sea captain and businessman who founded the Allan Shipping Line in 1819. Rising from shoemaker to shipping magnate in little more than thirty years, Allan retired in 1839 having made a fortune and created a transatlantic dynasty. He is recognised as one of the major contributors to Scotland's commercial interests in the early 19th century, and to the establishment of the Firth of Clyde as an international centre of shipping. During the Napoleonic Wars his brig \"Jean\" – so named for his wife – held the record for the fastest crossing between the Firth of Clyde and Quebec City. Under his five sons, the Allan Line became the world's largest privately owned shipping empire.\n\nSandy Allan was born at Fairlie, North Ayrshire, the third son of James Allan – a cheerful and well-respected carpenter on the Fairlie House estate – and his wife Jean Brown (1750–1821), daughter of Gilbert Brown (1708–1774). His mother was the younger sister of Agnes (Brown) Burns, the mother of Sandy's famous first cousin, the Scottish bard, Robert Burns, whose family also worked on the Fairlie estate. In the summer of 1786, Robert Burns stayed with the Allans at their cottage while avoiding a writ from James Armour in consequence of his relationship with Jean Armour.\n\nSandy Allan had expected to become a carpenter, but after his father's death when he was twelve, he was apprenticed to a shoemaker in Kilmarnock, working ten hours a day, except on Sundays. By 1800, when he was employed as a journeyman shoemaker near Galston, Sandy quit and moved to Saltcoats, intent on learning to be a ship's carpenter. He gave that idea up almost immediately for the chance to go to sea and was soon sailing as mate to Captain John Wilson of Saltcoats. Within a few years, Allan had served as Master and part-owner of several first-class ships trading out of Saltcoats. In 1806, at Saltcoats, he married Jean Crawford (1782–1856), whose family lived in a small cottage in Castleweerock.\n\nDuring the Peninsular War, Captain Allan was master of the 175 ton brigantine \"Hero\". It was chartered by the British government to transport troops, cattle and goods to Spain to supply Wellington's army. Vessels such as his were usually put under the protection of an armed convoy to ensure their safety, but Captain Allan grew impatient with the delay that these escorts added to his voyages. It was his practice to separate himself from the protecting warships and pursue his voyages unaccompanied, therefore making the journey in as short a time as possible. Those vessels which remained under convoy were always held up by the slowest in the group. His trips to Spain, although somewhat hazardous, were successful, and by 1814, Captain Allan had established a reputation for himself as both an excellent mariner and a shrewd businessman.\n\nSince taking command of the \"Jean\", every spring and fall, Allan took his brig from Greenock to Montreal and back again. The produce that he exported belonged to dry goods merchants, many of whom had houses on both sides of the Atlantic. It was Allan's responsibility as captain of the ship to both navigate across the ocean and sell the cargo on arrival, before purchasing Canadian supplies to be sold back to dry goods merchants in Scotland. On the outward journey his ship was filled with coal, iron, herrings, sugar and West Indian spices. On the return journey he took back wheat, peas, flour, pot ashes and most importantly, timber.\n\nCaptain Allan soon gained a reputation as an adept trader, and he was frequently known to have sold his entire cargo within a few hours of his arrival in Greenock from Montreal. During the Napoleonic Wars, the \"Jean\" also held the record for the fastest crossing between the Firth of Clyde and Quebec City. During this period trade with Canada was still in its infancy, but the route which Allan pioneered between Greenock and Montreal would soon become synonymous with the Allan Line, only on a far greater scale. By 1819, Allan had bought out his co-owners and the Allan Line, which then consisted of himself and the \"Jean\", was born.\n\nAlthough Glasgow furnished most of Allan's outward cargoes, the goods were transferred from there to Greenock, which was the port of loading and discharge for Canadian traders. So as to be better able to conduct his shipping business, Captain Allan moved his family from Saltcoats to Greenock in 1824.\n\nIn the winter of 1824, Captain Allan had the brig \"Favorite\" built in Montreal, though the materials used to construct it had been sent out from Scotland. The ship turned out to be appropriately named as it was much in demand as a safe and speedy conveyance, both of goods and passengers. It was in the \"Favourite\" that Captain Allan's first and third sons (James and Bryce) received their nautical training.\n\nIn 1830, the 329 ton ship \"Canada\" was built for Captain Allan by Robert Steel & Co., of Greenock. The launch of this 'monster vessel', as she was then regarded, was one of the notable events of the time. Crowds turned out to see her, and her arrival in Montreal produced quite a sensation there. Captain Allan himself commanded the \"Canada\" while his son James succeeded him in the command of the \"Favorite\".\n\nThe superiority of the British-built ship over that of the colonial led Captain Allan to contract with Robert Steel & Co. for another ship, the barque \"Arabian\". This vessel was built in 1837, and Captain Allan's eldest son, James, was promoted to her command. The ownership of these latter vessels was almost exclusively confined to the Allan family as their need for investors became less necessary. The first voyage of the \"Arabian\" was made from Greenock to Canada in June 1837, and on her return to the Firth of Clyde she proceeded to Glasgow, which was now possible as a result of the recently undertaken dredging operations. The \"Canada\", which was a deeper drafted vessel than the \"Arabian\", was not permitted to ascend the river until the following year, 1838. From this period onwards the terminal port of the inward Clyde-bound ships with general cargo and their outward loading port was Glasgow, and as such Captain Allan and his family made their new home there.\n\nVessel after vessel was added to the Allan fleet, and soon Captain Allan's eldest son, James (1808–1880), retired from the sea to conduct the business of their now extensive shipping line, at Glasgow. The youngest of Captain Allan's five sons, Alexander (1825–1892), though still at a young age, joined James in the management of the Glasgow business.\n\nThe second son, Hugh (1810–1882), had at an early age been settled by his father in Montreal at the office of their shipping agents, where the fourth son, Andrew (1822–1901), would later follow him. Hugh possessed in a high degree the energy of his father, and in Montreal he speedily came to the front, becoming, while yet still young, a partner, and ultimately the head of the firm.\n\nThe increase of their fleets enabled the Allans to establish a branch of their service at Liverpool and a continued presence in the agency was needed there. The third son, Bryce (1814–1874), who had been in command of one of the ships, withdrew from the sea and took charge of the Liverpool branch.\n\nWith his five sons settled at the terminal ports of their vessels, Captain Sandy Allan retired from active duty in 1839, but still took an active interest in the company. The principal direction of the affairs of the Allan Line now rested with the eldest son, James, later to be overtaken by Hugh.\n\nCaptain Allan died 18 March 1854, aged 74. In his progress from shoemaker to seaman, ship's mate to shipping magnate, he had made his fortune and established a dynasty. At the same time, he had done a great deal for Scotland's commercial interests and for the Clyde as a shipping centre. He did live to see the initial step which ended in the substitution of steamships for sailing ships in the Allan's Canadian trade, but it needed the courage and skill of the second generation to effect the change. When the proposition was first made, the old captain gravely shook his head and warned his sons to take care.\n\nIn 1854, the first Allan steamship, the \"Canadian\" was launched at Dumbarton. This was speedily followed by three others, also constructed by Dennys of Dumbarton – the \"Indian\", \"Anglo-Saxon\" and \"North American\". The two first-named steamers were profitably employed by the British government during the Crimean War. In peace, they settled down to the trade for which they were built, the Canadian mail service, the first of the Allan Line Royal Mail Steamers. The service, subsidised by the Government of Canada, was at first fortnightly in summer and monthly in winter before becoming weekly all the year round five years later.\n\n"}

An elder sister of Motown founder Berry Gordy, she became a record executive in the mid-to-late 1950s distributing records released on Checker and Gone Records before forming the Anna label with Billy Davis and sister Gwen. Gordy later became known as a songwriter for several hits including the Originals' \"Baby, I'm for Real\", and at least two songs on Marvin Gaye's \"What's Going On\" album. The first wife of Gaye, their turbulent marriage later served as inspiration for Gaye's album, \"Here, My Dear\".\n\nBorn Anna Ruby Gordy on January 28, 1922 in Oconee, Georgia, she was the third eldest of Berry Gordy Sr. (Berry Gordy II) and Bertha Ida (née Fuller) Gordy's eight children. Into her first year, Gordy's family relocated to Detroit. Following graduation from high school in 1940, Gordy relocated to California, which is where Gordy's younger brother Berry moved to after he dropped out of high school to form a boxing career. Returning to Detroit in the mid-1950s, she and younger sister Gwen became operators of the photo concession at Detroit's Flame Show Bar.\n\nBy the late 1950s, members of the Gordy clan were getting involved with the music business. In 1956, Anna began her career distributing records for Checker Records. In about 1957, she distributed a few recordings for Gone Records. In 1958, Anna and Gordy's younger sister Gwen founded the label Anna Records with musician Billy Davis, a year before Berry launched Tamla Records. Anna distributed Tamla's first national hit, Barrett Strong's \"Money (That's What I Want)\". Artists such as David Ruffin and Joe Tex also recorded for the label, and Marvin Gaye became a session musician with the company. After the label was absorbed as a subsidiary of Motown in 1961, Gordy joined Motown as a songwriter. Some of her early compositions were recorded by Gaye and Mary Wells. In 1965, Gordy co-wrote Stevie Wonder's \"What Christmas Means to Me\".\n\nGordy later co-composed the Originals' hits \"Baby, I'm for Real\" and \"The Bells\" with Marvin Gaye. Gordy's name was included as a co-songwriter on two songs on Gaye's 1971 album, \"What's Going On\", including \"Flyin' High (In the Friendly Sky)\" and \"God Is Love\". In 1973, Gordy's name was included in the credits to the song \"Just to Keep You Satisfied\", which was originally recorded in 1969 by the Monitors, and recorded by the Originals two years later. Gaye's version was overdubbed from the Originals recording and reversed the song's romantic lyrics for a more solemn view of the end of a marriage. Gordy left Motown at the end of the 1970s and retired from the music industry.\n\nGordy met Marvin Gaye in 1959 when he was 20 years old and singing with Harvey and the New Moonglows. Gaye soon began working at Anna Records and soon developed an attraction to Ms. Gordy. They eventually began dating in 1960. After a three-year courtship, they married in June 1963.\n\nInspired by their romance, Marvin penned hit singles about Anna including \"Stubborn Kind of Fellow\", \"Pride & Joy\" and \"You're a Wonderful One\". Of \"Pride and Joy\", Gaye said, \"When I composed 'Pride and Joy', I was head over heels in love with Anna. I just wrote what I felt about her, and what she did for me. She was my pride and joy.\"\n\nThe marriage between Marvin and Anna was reportedly turbulent, including two public spats. In order to bring some stability to their home life, Anna and Marvin adopted a boy born on November 17, 1966, who was named after his adopted father (Marvin Pentz Gaye III). The boy was said to have been naturally conceived by Anna and Marvin in Motown's public relations stories of the couple, but Marvin confirmed his adoption in David Ritz's biography, \"\". In later years, the identity of the mother was revealed to be Denise Gordy, Anna's niece.\n\nIn 1971, the couple moved to Hollywood. Two years later, they filed for legal separation. Gaye settled in with a young woman named Janis Hunter, with whom he had two children. In November 1975, Gordy filed for divorce. After nearly two years, the case was settled in Gordy's favor after Gaye agreed to remit a portion of his royalties from his next album to her. The resulting album, \"Here, My Dear\", gave audiences a view of the marriage from Marvin's point of view. After its release in December 1978, Gordy threatened to sue Marvin for $5 million for invasion of privacy. Nothing came of her threat.\n\nIn the 1980s, Marvin and Anna reconciled as friends, and Anna accompanied Marvin to industry events following the release of his comeback album \"Midnight Love\", in 1982. Anna attended the Grammy Awards in 1983, at which Marvin was awarded two trophies. Marvin's death in 1984 devastated Anna; later she and Marvin's three children scattered most of his ashes near the Pacific Ocean, while she kept a portion. When Marvin was honored with induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Anna and Marvin Gaye III accepted on his behalf. \n\nGordy never remarried. Her last public appearance was in June 2008. She attended a Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Heart Foundation event at which her brother Berry was honored. \n\nGordy died on January 31, 2014, three days after her 92nd birthday. She is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park – Hollywood Hills, Courts of Remembrance, Sanctuary of Enduring Protection, Private Family Room 70 ().\n"}

It held that there is a rebuttable presumption against an intention to create a legally enforceable agreement when the agreement is domestic in nature.\n\nMr Balfour was a civil engineer, and worked for the Government as the Director of Irrigation in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Mrs Balfour was living with him. In 1915, they both came back to England during Mr Balfour's leave. But Mrs Balfour had developed rheumatic arthritis. Her doctor advised her to stay in England, because the Ceylon climate would be detrimental to her health. Mr Balfour's boat was about to set sail, and he orally promised her £30 a month until she came back to Ceylon. They drifted apart, and Mr Balfour wrote saying it was better that they remain apart. In March 1918, Mrs Balfour sued him to keep up with the monthly £30 payments. In July she got a decree nisi and in December she obtained an order for alimony.\n\nAt first instance, Sargant J held that Mr Balfour was under an obligation to support his wife.\n\nThe Court of Appeal unanimously held that there was no enforceable agreement, although the depth of their reasoning differed. Warrington LJ delivered his opinion first, the core part being this passage.\n\nThen Duke LJ gave his. He placed weight on the fact that the parties had not yet been divorced, and that the promise had been made still whilst as husband and wife.\n\nLord Justice Atkin took a different approach, emphasising that there was no \"intention to effect legal relations\". That was so because it was a domestic agreement between husband and wife, and it meant the onus of proof was on the plaintiff, Mrs Balfour. She did not rebut the presumption.\n\nThe case is often cited in conjunction with \"Merritt v Merritt\" [1970] 2 All ER 760; [1970] 1 WLR 1211. Here the court distinguished the case from \"Balfour v Balfour\" on the fact that Mr and Mrs Merritt, although still married, were estranged at the time the agreement was made and therefore any agreement between them was made with the intention to create legal relations. Both cases are often quoted examples of the principle of precedent.\n\n"}

The organization has over 300 chapters on college and university campuses with over 300,000 members worldwide.\n\nBeta Alpha Psi encourages and recognizes scholastic and professional excellence in the business information field, promotes the study and practice of accounting, finance and information systems, and provides opportunities for self-development, service and association among members and practicing professionals. It \"strives to encourage a sense of ethical, social, and public responsibility\". The organization also promotes the development of technical and professional skills that are used to complement the university education, philanthropic activities, and interaction between students, faculty and professionals. Beta Alpha Psi's objectives are accomplished through the activities of each chapter respectively. Each chapter receives financial funding for these activities through sponsorship of various public and private firms.\n\nOn April 17, 1896, the New York legislature established the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) designation. This designation in business encouraged a greater focus on accounting and commerce knowledge, and Beta Alpha Psi was formed in 1919 to promote the CPA rank on college campuses. Two years after its founding, all of the existing U.S. states had adopted CPA regulations.\n\nBeta Alpha Psi's beginnings relate to Hiram Scovill, class of 1908, an accounting professor, during his return to the University of Illinois in 1908. Several new honor societies and professional fraternities that had formed a few years before Scovill's return introduced students to the benefits of professional organizations.\n\nScovill and his junior colleague A. C. Littleton formed an accounting club on campus in 1917. Beta Alpha Psi emerged two years later. The first members were six students from Professor Scovill's CPA course. The organization was founded on the three basic principles of scholarship, practicality, and sociability, and its initial objective was to stimulate cooperation and interest in accounting.One of its main purposes was to encourage and foster service as the basis of the accounting profession and to secure the highest ethical ideals in the practice of accountancy. On this multifaceted base, eleven students were initiated as active members of the organization on February 12, 1919. Professor Scovill was initiated as an honorary member.\n\nIn the original constitution for the University of Illinois chapter, the initiation fee was $10 and dues were an additional $2 per semester. Any member who was absent from a function without first being excused was charged 25 cents. Section I, Article IV, of the original constitution stated that any male person who was registered in third-year accounting, who contemplated a continuance in accounting work, and who had a junior class standing as shown by his college records was eligible for membership in the organization.\n\nNine of the eleven members became CPAs. By 1939, only one of the original eleven members, the first president Russell Morrison, was a practicing CPA. Morrison was actively involved in the American Accounting Association. In 1964, he, along with eight other leading accounting professors, was selected to serve on the \"Committee to Prepare a Statement of Basic Accounting Theory\", which provided major contributions to American accounting thought. In February 1921, Beta Alpha Psi officially became a national organization after it adopted a national constitution. Less than nine years later, the organization boasted 900 members, and on November 8, 1950, Jeannie Skelton, the first female member of Beta Alpha Psi, was inducted into the Miami University (Ohio) chapter.\n\nBeta Alpha Psi's logo consists of three different aspects: the emblem, the rising sun, and the crossed keys. The emblem is used to promote the promise of careers for financial information professionals. The rising sun represents the professionals who continuously rise higher. The crossed keys symbolize the knowledge Beta Alpha Psi provides that will unlock the doors for the financial world. Together these three aspects represent what Beta Alpha Psi is about. The Greek letters Beta Alpha Psi represent scholarship, social responsibility, and practicality respectively.\n\nBeta Alpha Psi continues to grow as new chapters are installed internationally. Outside the United States, local chapters operate at the University of Sydney and University of Technology Sydney in Australia; and at Massey University, the University of Auckland, the University of Waikato, and at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand.\n\nBeta Alpha Psi is governed by a constitution and by laws. It is managed by the Board of Directors, which consists of thirteen financial information professionals or professors of accounting, finance or information systems, the Professional Partners chair, and two alumni representatives. The alumni representatives are recent graduates who were active in their Beta Alpha Psi chapters.\n\nThe organization relies on funding to support its activities. Beta Alpha Psi receives a portion of its funding from charter maintenance fees and an initiation fee. The initiation fee is a one-time fee and is paid upon acceptance into the organization. A majority of the organization's funding comes from contributions from industry, consulting, and professional service firms. They include but are not limited to donations from alumni of the organization.\n\nBeta Alpha Psi's Professional Partners consists of prominent professional accountants who are active in public accounting, industry, and government. Members serve three-year terms. The Partners provides the Board of Directors independent, external advice on and assistance in both the routine operations and the special projects of the organization.\n\nThe International Chapter is composed of all faculty advisors, student presidents, and past and present members of Beta Alpha Psi. This body holds a meeting every year and provides advice and assistance to the Board of Directors. Local chapters are composed of the students and the faculty members at each university. Students guide each chapter's activities while faculty advisors mentor the chapters and provide a liaison between the members and other faculty. But different local chapters operate in diverse ways. While some chapters are organized as accounting honor societies or others operate as financial information fraternities.\n\nThere are several requirements that must be met before starting a chapter:\nPetitioning applications can be submitted at any time during the year.If the petition is approved, the chapter will be eligible for installation after 60 days from the date of approval. Before the installation can be scheduled, the petitioning chapter must submit certain fees, names of charter members, and the address which installation materials should be mailed to.\n\nIn order to become a part of Beta Alpha Psi, students must be invited to join by the local chapter at the university they attend, and they are required to meet various requirements.\n\nThe minimum requirements for eligibility to be elected as a pledge, though a chapter can set stricter requirements, include:\n\nA separate set of requirements is set for election to membership, including:\n\nThe following alumni have distinguished themselves in business or in service to Beta Alpha Psi.\n\n"}

She attended school in Lowell until she was sent to the Academy of the Visitation in Washington, D.C. at age 13, where she described the sectional tension between northern and southern students on the eve of the Civil War.\n\nBlanche met Adelbert Ames, who had served under her father in the Army of the James, while he was serving as Senator from Mississippi during Reconstruction. They married at Saint Anne's Episcopal Church in Lowell, the same church where her parents were wed, on July 21, 1870, and had six children: Butler, Edith, Sarah, Blanche, Adelbert, Jr., and Jessie. When her husband was elected Governor of Mississippi in 1873, Blanche accompanied him, and wrote a series of letters detailing her experiences as a Northern woman living in the South during Reconstruction. After Adelbert resigned under pressure in 1876, the Ames family returned to Lowell to pursue business interests, where they remained for much the rest of their lives.\n\nAfter her husband's death in 1933, Mrs. Ames compiled a collection of their letters, released by the family as \"Chronicles from the Nineteenth Century: Family Letters of Blanche Butler and Adelbert Ames\" in 1957. She also compiled a detailed account of the Butler Ancestry in 1895. She died at the Ames winter home in Ormond Beach, Florida, on December 26, 1939, at the age of 92, and is buried beside her husband and their children at the Hildreth family cemetery in Lowell, across from her parents and siblings.\n\n\n"}

Upon completion of the exams and required practical work experience the CAT graduate will be able to apply to use the letters CAT after his or her name. In addition, they will have the opportunity to join the CAT alumni.\n\nAlthough CAT can be obtained as a stand-alone qualification, it is often the case that individuals study for CAT as an introductionary qualification in accountancy prior to training to become a Chartered Certified Accountant through the ACCA Professional Scheme. It usually takes one and a half years to complete the nine CAT exams. However, there is no restriction on the number of papers that can be attempted in each sitting.\n\nCAT's rival is the Association of Accounting Technicians (AAT) qualification. ACCA was a sponsor of the AAT before breaking its links in the mid 1990s in order to form the CAT qualification. The rationale behind this move was that it wanted a technician level qualification which followed the same strategic direction of the ACCA qualification, i.e. one with an international profile. \n\nThe Certified Accounting Technician qualification (CAT) has now been placed on the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) National Qualifications Framework, which means that publicly funded educational institutions are now eligible for grants to help them train individuals towards this qualification in the United Kingdom.\n\nUnder a recent re-structure of its courses, the ACCA has placed the CAT as part of the Foundations in Accountancy suite of qualifications.\n\n\n"}

His father was Tașcu Belimace. He attended school in his native village and at a Serbian school in Belgrade. In 1873, he moved to Bucharest, capital of the Romanian Old Kingdom. There, he opened a restaurant favored by students, particularly from south of the Danube, and by writers. In the enthusiastically patriotic atmosphere that followed the Romanian War of Independence, Belimace began composing poems, thus becoming among the first writers in the Aromanian language: \"Cucotul\" (Romanian: \"Cocoșul\"; \"The Rooster\") and \"Dimândarea părintească\" (\"Porunca părintească\"; \"The Parents' Command\").

It governs the packaging, labelling, sale, importation and advertising of prepackaged and certain other products.\n\nIt requires that prepackaged consumer products bear accurate and meaningful labelling information to help consumers make informed purchasing decisions. The Act prohibits the making of false or misleading representations and sets out specifications for mandatory label information such as the product's name, net quantity and dealer identity. It allows designated inspectors to: enter any place at any reasonable time; examine prepackaged products, open packages, examine and make copies of documents or papers; and seize products, labelling, packaging or advertising material which do not conform with the Act and Regulations. Conviction of an offense under the Act is rewarded with up to a year in prison and a $10,000 fine.\n\nThe administration and enforcement of the Act and Regulations, as they relate to non‑food products, is the responsibility of the Competition Bureau, an agency of Industry Canada. Administration and enforcement of the Act and Regulations, as it relates to food products, is the responsibility of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). There are certain classes of items that are exempt from the CPLA, such as commercial, industrial, or institutional use only products or drugs or products for export only. The regulations govern the consistency, completeness, and accuracy of the labelling and packaging of consumer goods. These regulations create a uniform method for the labelling and packaging of consumer goods to assist consumers in making informed choices in the marketplace. A helpful Guide is available from the Federal government. The CPLA broadly defines \"product\" to mean any article that is, or may be, the subject of trade or commerce, including both food and non-food items. Textiles fall under the Textile Labelling Act, while precious metals fall under the Precious Metals Marking Act.\n\nThe Act has undergone several major revisions throughout its time: in 2002-12-31, in 2011-11-29, in 2015-02-26.\n\nIn 2016, Two executives of Mucci International Marketing Inc. and Mucci Pac Ltd. and their companies were levied fines by the CFIA tribunal that totalled $1.5 million. Their offense was fraudulently to put \"Product of Canada\" labels on large quantities of peppers, tomatoes and cucumbers grown mainly in Mexico. The defendants supplied the mislabelled produce to Costco, to Loblaws and to Sobeys. The fraud at the Ontario Food Terminal was discovered in 2012, and investigators later executed in 2013 and 2014 three search warrants, which resulted in the seizure of more than 70 boxes of documents. A court in Windsor, Ontario heard the case. The agreed statement of facts quoted an email of a Mucci worker, that he was told \"to make it Canada even though it is Mexico.\" The company, which was at the time located in Kingsville, Ontario, was also sentenced to probation for a three-year term.\n\nIn November 2017, a Maidstone, Ontario tomato processing company, that in addition had received a controversial $3-million provincial grant, was convicted of fraudulently mislabelling products as organic under the CAPA as well as other legislation. The owner and the company were also charged with falsifying the country of origin on their products between September 2013 and July 2015, passing off with labels that read \"Product of Canada\" produce that was American in origin. The owner was charged with lying to a federal food inspector on 8 January 2015. The case was heard in the Ontario Court of Justice. Separately, the company went bankrupt, owing more than a hundred creditors a total of over $25 million.\n\nOn 12 March 2018, a Leamington, Ontario greenhouse grower named AMCO Produce and its directors Fausto Amicone and Mark Wehby answered to charges brought by the CFIA for origin-of-vegetable fraud in a Windsor court. The corporation pleaded guilty to three charges under the Food and Drugs Act, the CPLA and the Canada Agricultural Products Act, and was fined $210,000. The individuals were let off in exchange for the guilty plea. The sentence included \"intrusive\" probation for a period of time under which the CFIA gains \"unfettered\" access to company records. The case began when the CFIA did in February 2013 a random inspection at the Ontario Food Terminal. Greenhouse peppers had been fraudulently mislabelled as Ontario produce at a time of year that was too cold for greenhouses to operate. The case covered offenses that occurred over a two-year span of time.\n"}

An active Republican, Kyle uncovered many instances of misappropriations in state and local governments during his fifteen years as auditor. He planned to run for governor in 2003, but he switched to the insurance commissioner race, when another Republican candidate for that office, Tony Perkins, a state representative from East Baton Rouge Parish, abandoned the campaign to become president of the Family Research Council.\n\nAs legislative auditor, Kyle posted an office sign \"In God We Trust, All Others We Audit.\" His work uncovered embezzlers, cronyism, and political kickbacks. His office moved against the late Elections Commissioner Jerry M. Fowler, indicted and convicted of receiving kickbacks from voting-machine contractors. Kyle investigated several college presidents but stressed that he does not believe in dismissing academic heads solely because of problems with an audit, as such positions are multi-faceted in scope. Kyle's work led to the conviction of nearly 250 public officials and government employees for the misappropriation of state funds.\n\nPrior to his auditor's position, Kyle, both a PhD and a C.P.A., taught governmental accounting and auditing from 1968-1989 at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. In 2000, Kyle uncovered serious problems with an audit of historically black Grambling State University in Grambling in Lincoln Parish. A 1998 audit of the same institution uncovered no problems, but two years later, the auditor received inaccurate and incomplete information from the university administration. Grambling had four months of data missing, which rendered it impossible to conduct the required two-year audit.\n\nIn 1998, Kyle was invited by Leo Deslatte, the new Republican mayor of Pineville in Rapides Parish, to conduct an audit of the previous Fred Baden administration. While Kyle's report found malfeasance regarding Baden's management, state Attorney General Richard Ieyoub declared insufficient evidence of wrongdoing to bring about an indictment of the 28-year Democratic mayor.\n\nIn the nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 4, 2003 for insurance commissioner, Kyle trailed the Democrat J. Robert Wooley, 424,961 (33.7 percent) to 467,084 (37.1 percent). Four lesser-known candidates held the remaining but critical 30 percent of the vote. In the general election, Wooley defeated Kyle, 773,578 (57.7 percent) to 567,034 (42.3 percent). Kyle won only a quartet of the more Republican parishes, Bossier, Lafayette, Livingston, and St. Tammany.\n\nKyle is a member of the East Baton Rouge Parish Republican Executive Committee.\nIn 2007, as the deputy chairman of the Louisiana Republican Party under chairman Roger F. Villere, Jr., Kyle worked for the unsuccessful GOP candidate for Louisiana attorney general, Royal Alexander of Shreveport, who was handily defeated by the Democrat, Buddy Caldwell of Tallulah. The GOP claimed that Caldwell spent public funds for personal uses and that he cursed and threatened Dan Kyle.\n\nIn 2008, Kyle along with another Republican, Wayne Carter, a parish council member, and a Democrat, Ron Johnson, ran unsuccessfully for the mayor-presidency of East Baton Rouge Parish but was handily defeated by the incumbent Democrat Kip Holden, an African American who scored his second term in the executive office. Kyle called for the establishment of a public bus system to help with traffic congestion. Kyle criticized Holden's bond issue as an example of \"tax-and-spend philosophy.\" Kyle ran a weak second in the mayor-parish presidency, having polled 12,886 votes (12.2 percent). Holden received 75,450 (71.2 percent) and Carter polled 11,341 (10.7 percent). Holden won in 2004 when he defeated the incumbent Republican Mayor-President Bobby R. Simpson.\n\nIn June 2009, as treasurer of the Louisiana GOP, Kyle became one of the directors of a national presidential fund-raising effort promoting Governor Bobby Jindal. According to Kyle, the group hopes to raise $60 million to persuade Jindal to seek the 2012 party nomination. Others on the committee are former State Representative Woody Jenkins and U.S. Representative Steve Scalise. Former Republican State Senator Tom Schedler of Slidell, had his name removed from the group, not because he opposes Jindal but because such fund-raising activity could conflict with Schedler's role as first assistant to Louisiana Secretary of State Jay Dardenne.\n\nIn October 2009, Kyle was named chief financial officer for Southern Star Amusement, Inc., a startup company which seeks to redevelop the Six Flags New Orleans theme park, closed since Hurricane Katrina struck in August 2005. Southern Star plans to construct a water and theme park at the former Six Flags site.\n\nKyle, whose place of birth is not known, entered the work force at the age of fourteen in 1951, at the time of his father's death. He laid bricks and worked in retail to provide for his family and to earn his way through college. He is married to the former Connie Musick (born 1943). The couple has two sons, Alfred Daniel Kyle (born 1966) and Ronald Glen Kyle (born 1969), both of Baton Rouge. At some point prior to coming to Baton Rouge, Kyle had resided in Huntsville, Alabama. Kyle received his Bachelor of Science in accounting in 1959 from Southern Arkansas University in Magnolia. He then procured an MBA in 1961 and a Ph.D. in business administration in 1968, both from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. The Kyles are active in the First United Methodist Church of Baton Rouge since they moved to the state capital in 1968.\n\nIn his 2003 race for insurance commissioner, Kyle summed up his political motivation, accordingly.\n\n\"Louisiana is my home. ... Louisiana is my passion. Hard economic times has split up too many families and forced our children to search for jobs in other states. ... I will fight to keep our children and grandchildren in Louisiana . . . it will take my experience, integrity, and leadership to rid this state of corruption, create an economic climate for growth, and get this state off the bottom.\"\n"}

The family’s engagement in the pharmaceutical sector began with his grandfather, Dimitris Giannakopoulos from Sellasia in Laconia, who in 1924 opened a pharmacy in the centre of Athens.\n\nIn 1971, Pavlos Giannakopoulos founded VIANEX. In 2012, despite the Greek financial crisis, the company announced net sales of up to €240,200,000. He is now the heir of the dynasty built by his father and his uncles, including both VIANEX and Panathinaikos B.C., marking the emergence of the new generation in particularly difficult times. In 2004, he was made first vice-president at VIANEX, while since January 2012, he has also assumed the office of Deputy CEO.\n\nHe is married to Ioanna Marosouli, with whom he has two children.\n\nDimitris Giannakopoulos took on the family business from his father, Pavlos, in January 2012, when he became Deputy CEO, additionally to being vice-president of the Board of Directors of VIANEX.\n\nThe company entered the new era under Dimitris Giannakopoulos' management, that was connected with the increase of openness and the conclusion of important deals, either new ones or renewals of old ones. In July 2013, on the occasion of the announcement of the cooperation between VIANEX and Eli Lilly, for the production of the inject-able antibiotic Vancomycin on the premises of VIANEX in China, and the export of 100% of the production to the Chinese market, Pavlos Giannakopoulos stated: \"I handed over to him the reigns of the largest Greek pharmaceutical company in the country, and I am convinced he will someday turn it into the largest pharmaceutical company even abroad\". VIANEX's goals include expansion to other foreign markets as well, such as South Korea, Vietnam, Japan, and Arabic countries.\n\nVIANEX received an award for its export orientation in the Active Greece Awards 2015. Furthermore, its portfolio comprises other significant awards, such as the Diamonds of the Greek Economy business award in 2013 and 2015, as well as Salux Index 2014. It is worth mentioning also the award in the Health & Safety Awards 2015, for the best practices in Health and Security in the workplace. The company won the \"VIANEX Integrated Health and Safety Quality Program\", the ultimate distinction in the \"Pharmaceutical Companies\" business sector.\n\nAs Dimitris Giannakopoulos has stated to the press on numerous occasions, VIANEX neither let any employees go, nor did it decrease salaries, despite the financial crisis in Greece. The economic size of VIANEX shrunk; however, its employees \"have stood by the company and contributed to achieving high profits over the last years. Thus we, the management, are obligated to support our people, regardless of the economic performance\", Dimitris Giannakopoulos stated in 2012.\n\nDimitris Giannakopoulos has engaged in a series of important initiatives with the intention to contribute to Greek society through VIANEX, Panathinaikos B.C., and the electronic media company DPG Group, which he also owns.\n\nTo raise awareness among the population, regarding the issue of cardiovascular disease, VIANEX donated 15,000 bad cholesterol tests within the context of the extended Panhellenic Patient Support Project \"Measure LDL with us\", under the auspices of the Hellenic Society of Lipidology, Atherosclerosis and Vascular Disease (E.E.L.I.A.).\n\nAlso, VIANEX donated 300 vaccines to the Social Clinic and Pharmacy of\nthe diocese of Arkalochori, Kastelli & Viannos, and the Municipality of Minoa Pediadas in Crete, aiming to defend child health, as well as safeguard public health. DPG offered support to the Mitera - Centre for Child Protection of Attica; its people visited the infant centre and the dormitories of the premises, to give away presents for Christmas, such as candy, clothes, shoes, Sudocream lotions, as well as Panathinaikos blankets from the PAO Shop. Also, it responded to the invitation of Make-a-Wish foundation (Make-a-Wish Greece), by taking part in the charity dinner organized at the Benaki Museum. Panathinaikos B.C. and Dimitris Giannakopoulos donated five cutting-edge wheelchairs to the Patriotic Institution of Social Welfare (PIKPA) of Voula, for the basketball team of the institution during the National Championship of Wheelchair Basketball. The President of the Panhellenic Association of Paraplegics (PA.S.PA) awarded Dimitris Giannakopoulos for his social contribution.\n\nDimitris Giannakopoulos donated specialized equipment of €50,000 in worth to the Underwater Operations Unit of the Hellenic Coast Guard. The Head of the Hellenic Coast Guard, Vice Admiral Athanasios Athanasopoulos, and the Commander of Special Forces, Captain Alexios Karakoulas, awarded Giannakopoulos with an honorary coat of arms for his contribution.\n\nHe donated also 55 fluorescent wind-proof jackets to the Road Traffic Police of the Attica Tollway (Attiki Odos), to help upgrade their equipment, and the facilitation of the work of the police officers, in the presence of the Colonel of the Road Traffic Police, Brigadier General D. Papanagiotou and the Commander of the Road Traffic Police Unit of the Attica Tollway, Police Second Lieutenant E. Kountouromichalis. The Colonel of the Road Traffic Police thanked Mr. Giannakopoulos, offering him an honorary badge. \nIn the context of the VIANEX contribution, Dimitris Giannakopoulos donated to the Hellenic Police 10 high-performance motorcycles.\n\nIn 2012, Dimitris Giannakopoulos took charge of Panathinaikos B.C., after his father, Pavlos, and his uncle, Thanasis, who managed the club before him.\n\nDuring his Presidency, the team won two consecutive Greek doubles (Greek Basket League championship and Greek Cup). However, in December 2014, he resigned from the club's President position, giving his seat to Manos Papadopoulos. He claimed to have been forced to proceed to such a move because of the constant sanctions and fines imposed on the club by the Greek State.\n\nIn recent years, Dimitris Giannakopoulos has created a Media Group in cooperation with DPG Digital Media, which is a series of websites of political, sport, medical, and social content, including the sports websites onsports.gr and leoforos.gr, the medical website onmed.gr, and many more. The long-standing success in the management of web communication media for DPG was sealed by its cooperation with CNN.\n\nDPG, along with the international news giant CNN, established CNN.gr. Dimitris Giannakopoulos, the President of DPG Group, stated on the occasion of the cooperation announcement: \"We are particularly pleased to become members of the international CNN family through this strategic cooperation. CNN.gr aims to provide to the Greek-speaking audience immediate and accurate Greek and international news, with the unique seal of quality provided by CNN, bringing at the same time the Greek diaspora closer to the motherland. In times marked by very important developments for Greece, we invest in a platform which will responsibly serve the increasing demand of the audience for accurate, timely, and quality information.\"\n\nGiannakopoulos was also the main financial contributor to the Greek football club Sparta F.C., which competes in the Greek football second division, and which is based in Sparta.\n\n\n<br>"}

The organization is headquartered in Beijing, China.\n\nThe European Chamber has more than 1,600 members from seven chapters active in nine Chinese cities including Beijing, Nanjing, South China (Guangzhou and Shenzhen), Shanghai, Shenyang, Southwest China (Chengdu and Chongqing) and Tianjin. The European Chamber is recognized by the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China and the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), and is registered with the Ministry of Civil Affairs (MCA).\n\nThe executive committee of the European Chamber consists of a president, five vice presidents, a treasurer, three member states' representatives and the European Chamber's Secretary General. Representatives of member companies are elected for a two-year term renewable once.\n\nThe supervisory board of the European Chamber consists of member representatives who elect three persons to represent the group on the executive committee. In addition to creating an electoral college, the supervisory board meets regularly to monitor and guide the work of the executive committee. The national representatives are nominated by national chambers of commerce or embassies by default.\n\nThe secretariat of the European Chamber is responsible for the daily operations and activities.\n\nAs a common platform for information and cooperation, the European Chamber publishes magazines and reports about the current experience of European businesses in China. These publications provide insights into current markets, key regulatory issues, industry-expert opinions, and notable social trends in China.\n\n\nThe European Chamber was founded on 19 October 2000, by 51 European companies in search of a common representative of their interests in China. The Chamber is also part of an expanding network of European Business Organisation Worldwide Network (EBOWWN). This network promotes interactions between members and host countries and establish closer relationships with the Commission. The original purpose of the Chamber was to monitor how China implemented its WTO commitments. According to the Chamber: \"Foreign firms have long complained of an uneven playing field and an opaque regulatory environment when it comes to China.\"\n\nThe European Chamber is an organization that aims for better market access and improved operating conditions for the European Union companies operating in China. To this end, it reaches out to Chinese and European government authorities, think tanks, academics, international bodies, other chambers of commerce and trade associations. The Chamber ensures awareness and compliance with relevant local laws, policies, and regulations. It also facilitates networking between its members, embassies and Chinese interest groups. They oversee a network of companies and professionals, help them exchange views and experiences regarding doing business in China. The European Chamber is primarily an advocacy organization that evolves around working groups and foras. These groups serve as a platform for the Chamber community and other local organizations, to foster understanding, share information, pursue common interests, promote trade and investment, and strengthen cooperation.\n\n"}

It was designed by Freenet creator Ian Clarke, Steven Starr and Rob Kramer in 2000, in response to allegations that artists would not receive adequate compensation for their work without enforceable copyrights. Starr came up with the name.\n\nIn the FairShare system, the investor/patrons would provide venture capital. Clarke envisions that 45% of the money invested in a given artist would go directly to that artist, while another 45% would be given to previous investors. The remaining 10% would be kept by the maintainers of each FairShare service company.\n\nIn some ways this model is similar to a pyramid scheme, but Clarke counters that a vital difference is that nobody would be promised a return on their investment. He argues that regardless of any profits, each patron would have the satisfaction of knowing that they supported an artist whose work they appreciate. Also, earlier investors would profit more, thus rewarding them for investing in artists before they became more popular. The early investors would serve a similar role to studios' talent scouts.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7639771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7639771", "title": "Indirect costs", "text": "Indirect costs\n\nIndirect costs are costs that are not directly accountable to a cost object (such as a particular project, facility, function or product). Indirect costs may be either fixed or variable. Indirect costs include administration, personnel and security costs. These are those costs which are not directly related to production. Some indirect costs may be overhead. But some overhead costs can be directly attributed to a project and are direct costs.\n\nThere are two types of indirect costs. One are the fixed indirect costs which contains activities or costs that are fixed for a particular project or company like transportation of labor to the working site, building temporary roads, etc. The other are recurring indirect costs which contains activities that repeat for a particular company like maintenance of records or payment of salaries.\n\nMost cost estimates are broken down into direct costs and indirect costs.\n\nDirect costs are directly attributable to the object and it is financially feasible to do so. In construction, the costs of materials, labor, equipment, etc., and all directly involved efforts or expenses for the cost object are direct costs. In manufacturing or other non-construction industries the portion of operating costs that is directly assignable to a specific product or process is a direct cost. Direct costs are those for activities or services that benefit specific projects, for example salaries for project staff and materials required for a particular project. Because these activities are easily traced to projects, their costs are usually charged to projects on an item-by-item basis.\n\nIndirect costs are, but not necessarily, not directly attributable to a cost object. It should be financially infeasible to do so. Indirect costs are typically allocated to a cost object on some basis. In construction, all costs which are required for completion of the installation, but are not directly attributable to the cost object are indirect, such as overhead. In manufacturing, costs not directly assignable to the end product or process are indirect. These may be costs for management, insurance, taxes, or maintenance, for example. Indirect costs are those for activities or services that benefit more than one project. Their precise benefits to a specific project are often difficult or impossible to trace. For example, it may be difficult to determine precisely how the activities of the director of an organization benefit a specific project. Indirect costs do not vary substantially within certain production volumes or other indicators of activity, and so they may sometimes be considered to be fixed costs.\n\nIt is possible to justify the handling of almost any kind of cost as either direct or indirect. Labor costs, for example, can be indirect, as in the case of maintenance personnel and executive officers; or they can be direct, as in the case of project staff members. Similarly, materials such as miscellaneous supplies purchased in bulk—pencils, pens, paper—are typically handled as indirect costs, while materials required for specific projects are charged as direct costs.\n\nBe cautious here, because the nature of the cost depends on the industry. For example, fuel cost in a telecom is usually allocated as an indirect cost, while for an airliner it is a direct cost.\n\n\n\nNote that if electricity is not used as primary source for production then electricity cost will be treated as utility and is always indirect. For example, if electricity is required to run the boiler which in turn generates steam, then electricity which needs to be allocated directly.\n\n"}
{"id": "1723083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1723083", "title": "Internal communications", "text": "Internal communications\n\nInternal communications (IC) is the function responsible for effective communications among participants within an organization. The scope of the function varies by organization and practitioner, from producing and delivering messages and campaigns on behalf of management, to facilitating two-way dialogue and developing the communication skills of the organization's participants.\n\nModern understanding of internal communications is a field of its own and draws on the theory and practice of related professions, not least journalism, knowledge management, public relations (e.g., media relations), marketing and human resources, as well as wider organizational studies, communication theory, social psychology, sociology and political science.\n\nLarge industrial organizations have a long history of promoting pride and a sense of unity among the employees of the company, evidenced in the cultural productions of Victorian-era soap manufacturers as far apart as the UK's Lever Brothers (right) and the Larkin Soap Company of Buffalo, New York.\n\nInternal communications is fundamentally a management discipline, but as a discrete discipline of organizational theory it is correspondingly young. Stanford associate professor Alex Heron's \"Sharing Information with Employees\" (1943) is an outlier among texts which focus solely on the factors involved. Theorization in academic papers accelerated in the 1970s, but mainstream management texts mostly post-date 1990.\n\nWriting in 2013, Ruck and Yaxley explore how the discipline evolved from the days of employee publications in the late 19th century. As organisations became more complex, the impetus to communicate with employees grew and led to the emergence of an increasingly specialised discipline.\n\nThe purpose that a formally appointed IC manager or IC team will serve within a given organization will depend on the business context. In one, the IC function may perform the role of 'internal marketing' (i.e., attempting to win participants over to the management vision of the organization); in another, it might perform a 'logistical' service as channel manager; in a third, it might act principally as strategic adviser.\n\nThere is a practical distinction to make between managed communication and regular interactions among teams or between managers and subordinates. Minzberg talks about the fact that communicating is intrinsic to the work of a manager - especially so in an information society. Interpersonal communications in the workplace are explored by writers such as Phillip Clampitt.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why organisations should be concerned with internal communication. Employees are the heart and soul of an organization, thus it’s critical to pay attention to their needs. An engaged and committed employee work force increases and drives business results. Employee engagement encourages higher employee performance, results in lower turnover and offers competitive advantage. Even in a difficult economy, companies need to inspire and retain high performers.\n\nImportantly, there is commonly a legal requirement for organizations to communicate with their workers. In Europe, for example, the EU has made very specific provision about workers' rights to be informed and consulted with Directive 94/45/EC (Works Council).\n\nEffective internal communications is commonly understood by practitioners to improve employee engagement (see, for example, the UK government-sponsored Macleod Report) and therefore to add significant value to organizations on metrics from productivity to customer research.\n\nAs noted in Quirke (2008): \"Traditionally, internal communications has focused on the announcement of management conclusions and the packaging of management thinking into messages for mass distribution to the 'troops'\". Research indicates a limit to the value of this 'broadcasting' model of IC. Without feedback loops and harnessing the active involvement and mediation skills of frontline supervisors or team leaders, broadcasting tends to be more effective at influencing senior and middle managers than frontline employees - see, e.g., Larkin and Larkin (1994).\n\nAs the IC function matures within the organization, then, it may come to play a wider role in facilitating conversations \"upwards\", \"downwards\" and \"across\" the organization, \"per\" Stohl (1995). Organizations increasingly see IC as playing a role in external reputation management. Joep Cornelissen in his book \"Corporate Communications\" touches on the relationship between reputation and internal conversations. This trend reaches its full potential with the arrival of new 'norms' and customer expectations around social media, for example in the work of Scoble and Israel. Market researchers MORI have likewise highlighted the effects of employee advocacy on an organisation's external reputation.\n\nIC managers try to get senior leaders to think strategically about how management decisions can be perceived internally and externally. The focus of IC is often to ensure that employees can support a decision and understand how it impacts their work. An engaged employee is someone who is fully involved in, committed, and enthusiastic about his or her work. It’s the extent to which employees put discretionary effort into their work. Involvement of hearts as well as minds. The ability to work as a team across disciplines and functions. The understanding and commitment to achieving company goals and business context. Employee engagement speaks Engaged Employees Are More Productive to the level of trust in leadership, a belief that decisions are made in the best interests of the organization and its employees, and the level to which employees feel valued and appreciated. The more engaged, committed and inspired an employee is, the higher the employee performance, and the more impact on the bottom line.\n\nThere are two sides to strategy in internal communications. In the first instance there is the organization's strategy — what it hopes to achieve and how it plans to go about achieving it. That strategy will be supported and, to some extent, delivered through effective internal communications.\n\nIn this context internal communication can help on several different levels:\n\n\nSecondly, and more importantly, internal communications needs a strategy of its own. It should be positioned more than a simple plan of tactical interventions in support of business activities. The strategy should consider the following:\n\n\nThe strategy will inform the best way to organize effective communications.\n\nFive general modes of IC practice are itemised below, ranked loosely according to their position along a spectrum from \"tactical\" to \"strategic\" activities.\nFormal channels typically fall into one of four broad categories:\n\n\nInformal channels reflect the non-linear dynamics of a social network and can be as influential, if not more so, than official channels, often more likely to stimulate and create discussion and dialogue. The channels may manifest themselves via the rumour-mill, water-cooler conversations, social networking, graffiti, spoof newsletters, etc.\n\nOne of the key challenges any internal communicator will face is how to select the right channels - and the right mix of channels - for both the audience and the message. Bill Quirke offers a simplistic guide; See Weick for some theoretical grounds for this basic insight.\n\nThe practical considerations are:\n\nA typical large organisation IC function will be concerned to monitor and limit the \"quantity\" of information flowing through each internal channel, prioritising according to the relevance of a given message to the audience implicated in that channel, as well as the urgency and impact of the message. Such organisations typically face a risk that channels (such as intranet news, or email) are over-used for inappropriate, low value messages, causing vital audience groups to filter them out.\n\nIC teams will often (but not always) hold responsibility for the administration and development of several of the organisation's communications channels. The range of media available is wide - and growing fast with new electronic media. Initially, IC tends to focus on the existing resources of the organization, typically an intranet, email distributions, and newsletters.\n\nOne common element of channel development and administration involves managing supplier relationships - agencies external to the organization typically specialise in one main channel area, such as audiovisual, or print production.\n\nSending information down the line to local supervisors, expecting them to deliver it without any corruption, interpretation or deviation has long been the main focus of 'cascaded' internal communications (for example, UK guidance from The Industrial Society, now the Work Foundation, focused on giving managers very clear instructions about what to say and how to say it). However, in recent years thinking has evolved and literature now concentrates on empowering managers to facilitate discussion rather than cascade management of messages which will have little authority or impact. This is a particularly strong theme in the writing of TJ and Sandar Larkin. Clampitt (2005) lists three approaches managers use to communicate with their employees.\n\nEmployee communication is an important skill for all line managers, irrespective of their seniority. Like any skill it requires training and development. Often, organisations do not invest the appropriate amount of time and effort in developing managers' communications skills. Too often this leads to managers abdicating responsibility for communications to their 'internal communications department' and a lack of confidence in facilitating discussion in their teams. This raises debate around the following issues:\n\nFitzPatrick and Valskov argue that strong manager communication systems attempt to address five essential issues:\n\nSocial media is becoming increasingly discussed in the field of internal communication. However, there is little documented, academic evidence of where it is being used successfully as part of a planned campaign of employee communications, and it is often confused with digital media. There are case studies published on a number of commercial websites including www.simply-communicate.com and www.melcrum.com, and there is a useful chapter on the subject by Tracy Playle in Ruck's \"Exploring Internal Communication\".\n\nSince 2012, several communication technologies usually classified as workplace group chat apps or collaborative software have emerged.\n\nBasic IC services to an organization begin with editorial services - either fine-tuning messages drafted by participants in the organization, or drafting new material on their behalf. IC practitioners might simply correct basic grammar, etc., especially in organisations where many participants may be operating in their second or third language. Or they might re-work it to conform to house style or its branded equivalent, 'tone of voice'. The skillset involved relates closely to media professions such as journalism, copywriting and film or print production. Message design may be iterative, or involve a range of participants in an approvals process.\n\nIC practitioners may be seconded to a specific project team, to support the stages of the project that carry a communications or engagement component. Project communicators might produce a schedule of communication objectives and milestones for the project; a map of vital stakeholders (senior individuals or large groups / segments of the overall population); and a message framework to guide project participants towards a single, coherent message about their work. They might also contribute to the project's aggregate risks 'log' on the reputational risks, and work-up contingency plans covering unintended situations.\n\nMost writers on the subject of communications talk about the idea of change. Most intentional communication takes place with the aim of effecting some kind of change or another. However, many practitioners in internal communications make a distinction between change and transformation.\n\nDrawing on the work of writers such as William Bridges, practitioners talk of 'change' as the act of altering something within an organisation (such as the introduction of a new IT system or the closure of an office) and they describe 'transition' as the process through which an individual passes as part of the process of coping with change. The use of the two terms interchangeably causes some confusion. Communicators who specialise in change communications tend to be interested in behaviour change and will draw heavily on psychological models.\n\nThere are important contributions made to the debate about practice in this area by Herrero and Quike.\n\nOrganizations occasionally face unplanned reputational crises which can destroy brand value or even finish the organization. At such moments, the support of the internal constituency becomes especially valuable, as employees' friends and relatives seek their account of events, and as talented and motivated participants consider whether or not to remain with the organization.\n\nAs with media relations and PR, the role IC plays in a crisis can be decisive for the success or failure of an organization, as it responds to a critical challenge. Organizations with a mature IC function may have contingency planning in place, ready to be tailored to the particulars of the situation. They are also more likely to have 'well flexed', well-rehearsed line management communications capability, making crisis communications more effective. Less mature IC functions may find it difficult to bring senior leaders' attention to the internal audience, when critical stakeholders such as investors or customers appear more likely to desert the organization.\n\nAlthough unplanned and usually under-resourced, the quality of an IC function's response in a crisis often has a decisive impact in the maturing of an IC function within an organization. Effective responses bring IC up the list of priorities for senior leaders, following the crisis.\n\nIn recent years the practice of internal communications has professionalised.\n\nIn common with the Ulrich model for human resources practice, IC may be delivered via a 'business partnering' relationship, acting as adviser to a given function or unit on IC issues relevant to the delivery of their strategic plans and projects. As a representative of the audiences with a stake in the developments under discussion, this can be both an awkward and a privileged position to occupy, requiring skills of diplomacy and objectivity.\n\nThere is not yet a globally recognised internal communication qualification, though various training courses and formal qualifications have been established to create and maintain standards.\n\nIn the UK, the accreditation bodies representing the profession offer competing qualifications. The UK's Chartered Institute of Public Relations offers training and qualifications in internal communications including Diploma and Certificate courses. There are also postgraduate Diploma or Masters programmes in Internal Communications Management at Kingston University in London.\n\nIn Europe, related courses are available at the University of Lugano in Switzerland and Rotterdam School of Management in the Netherlands.\n\nIn Asia, internal communications is still a very nascent field with few specialists in more developed economies such as Singapore and Hong Kong, some accredited by the Singapore Business Advisors and Consultants Council.\n\nProfessional IC associations include the Institute of Internal Communication, the International Association of Business Communicators (IABC), and others. In 2013, IABC closed its Accredited Business Communicator qualification, but planned to launch a Certification Programme for Strategic Communicators in Autumn 2014.\n\nIC may variously be referred to as: employee communications, employee engagement, employee relations, internal marketing, company communications, staff communication. Responsibility for IC may sit within various established functions, including marketing, corporate communications, transformation, HR and the CEO office. Internal communications functions can require several skills, e.g.: writing, marketing, event organisation, web production, facilitation, advertising, stakeholder management, corporate social responsibility, branding and communications training.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40452331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40452331", "title": "James Sivewright", "text": "James Sivewright\n\nSir James Sivewright K.C.M.G. (1848–1916) was a businessman and politician of the Cape Colony, South Africa. He was a strong political ally of Cecil Rhodes and, as his cabinet minister, was implicated in the \"Logan\" corruption scandal that led to the fall of the first Rhodes government. \n\nJames Sivewright was born in Fochabers, Scotland. Graduating from the University of Aberdeen he entered the British Postal Service and co-authored the \"Textbook in Telegraphy\", a book that became a standard text book on the topic for a considerable time. \n\nHe emigrated to the Cape Colony in 1877 as a telegraphy expert. The Cape had recently wrested a degree of independence from Britain under the \"Responsible Government\" system, and its first Prime Minister John Molteno was embarking on a massive expansion in the country's infrastructure. Sivewright was one of the telegraphy experts which the Cape government imported to develop a telecommunications system for the country. From 1877 Sivewright helped to plan and construct the telegraphy networks for the Cape Colony, and then, up until 1881 likewise for the Transvaal, the Natal Colony and the Orange Free State.\n\nIn 1887 Sivewright became involved in politics, after he joined the Afrikaner Bond in Cape Town, and he was elected as the Bond representative of Griqualand East in 1888. \n\nSubsequently, he became immensely influential as an agent of the rising Imperialist politician Cecil Rhodes, within the Afrikaner Bond. He went on to act as an intermediate between Rhodes, and the Bond leader \"Onze Jan\" Hofmeyr. As Rhodes's right-hand man, he secured the Bond's support for Rhodes to take power in 1890 and become Prime Minister of the Cape. \n\nThroughout his career, Sivewright habitually mixed business and politics. In 1891 he secured an agreement for the Cape Government Railways, that gave them a 2-year monopoly on traffic to and from the new goldfields of the Transvaal. As a reward, Sivewright received a knighthood. \n\nHe also built increasingly powerful links with the principal mining tycoons of southern Africa, such as Barney Barnato. Sivewright's business links gained increasing criticism from opposition politicians who accused him of massive corruption.\n\nIn 1892, he secured a government contract for his friend and associate James Logan which involved a 15-year monopoly on the catering for the nation's Government-run Railway system. \n\nThe deal was immediately discovered, and a collection of the country's most powerful liberal politicians, including JW Sauer, John X. Merriman and James Rose-Innes, protested and attacked the deal. Eventually the Rhodes government was forced to cancel the deal, however it nonetheless compensated Logan massively with government money. The liberal politicians then refused to be part of any government that included Sivewright, however Sivewright still had the support of Rhodes and his connections with the Afrikaner Bond which were essential for the maintenance of the Rhodes government. \nThe surrounding scandal, and the stand-off that it caused, led to the fall of the first Rhodes Government. \n\nSivewright then moved to act as a discrete and unofficial railway diplomat.\n\nAfter the Jameson raid split apart the Cape political scene and was subsequently revealed to have been a plot by Cecil Rhodes, the Afrikaner Bond finally split with Rhodes, whose second government fell. \nFaced with the choice, Sivewright joined the Rhodesian, pro-Imperialist \"Progressive Party\". The move paid off when Rhodesian Prime Minister Gordon Sprigg gained power, and Sivewright was awarded the Commission of Crown Lands and Public Works. \n\nHe won a seat for Stellenbosch in 1898, standing as a Progressive, but it was soon discovered that his agents had been bribing voters, and he was consequently deposed.\n\nSivewright then traveled back to Britain but nonetheless kept strong political and business links with South Africa. In 1899, he arranged the Bloemfontein Conference, and he had diverse financial interests in southern Africa that he kept for the rest of his life. \n\nHis reputation for massive corruption never quite faded, and liberal activist Olive Schreiner recounts that: \n\"when both he (Rhodes) and Sivewright came forward to shake hands, I turned on my heel and went to my house.\"\n"}

Sequentially he moved to the Johns Hopkins University, where he was professor and director of its Institute of Law from 1928 to 1933. In 1934 Marshall was appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as member of the National Labor Board and of the National Recovery Administration to support Roosevelt's New Deal policies and the \"measure and combat the effects of the Great Depression.\" He also became a member of the National Educational Association. From 1936 to 1948 Marshall was Professor of Political Economy at American University in Washington, D.C.\n\nMarshall wrote several textbooks on Social Studies topics at the secondary school and grade-school level, starting with \"Materials For the Study of Elementary Economics\" in 1913 coauthored with James A. Field (1879-1927) and Chester Whitney Wright (1880-1966).\n\nMarshall came into prominence in the years from 1913 to 1919, when he was involved with professor of Economics James A. Field and the economic historian Chester W. Wright in \"attempts to move economics instruction away from the 'rigorous drill in orthodox theory' or the 'straight-jacket of conventional theory' to a method of instruction emphasizing the development of economic institutions, inquiry into current problems and issues, and fostering of creativity and originality (field 1917). To this end, they produced a book of readings to supplement the usual texts (Marshall, Wright, and Field 1913).\"\n\nIn 1918 Marshall published his \"Readings in Industrial Society.\" This work had a heavy emphasis on the institutional development of industrial society, the money economy and financial organization, machine industry, the wage system and the worker, industrial concentration, competition, private property, and social control.\"\n\nThe work contained reading from founders of the institutional economics such as Thorstein Veblen, Wesley Clair Mitchell, Walton H. Hamilton, Harold G. Moulton, Robert F. Hoxie, John M. Clark, Edwin Cannan, and John A. Hobson. He also reprinted diagrams from the work of Henry Rogers Seager, picturing the economic production and distribution from 1904, and Paul Nystrom, picturing the channels of distribution for various lines of goods from 1915.\n\nLeon Ardzrooni, known as \"Veblen's most faithful disciple\", reviewed the book for \"Political Science Quarterly,\" and introduced the work as follows:\nAs indicated in the subtitle of this formidable volume, the author has brought together a large array of descriptive material for \" a study in the structure and functioning of economic organization.\" Among a considerable number of students in the social sciences the feeling has been growing that economics, as studied in our colleges and universities, lacks the substance and security which is often obtained in other fields of intellectual endeavor by a happy coordination of historical perspective and speculative logomachy. With a view to attain such an end, there have appeared in recent years several volumes of \" selected readings \" for the study of economics and economic problems. The present one is a creditable addition to this goodly list in the publication of which the University of Chicago Press has taken a leading part.\n\nClarence Edwin Ayres explicitly regarded \"Marshall's book as a contribution to the institutional type of economics.\"\n\nIn 1921 Marshall and Leverett S. Lyon (1885-1959) published their \"Our economic organization.\" The main purpose of this book in the field of elementary economics is to present in systematic fashion the structure of economic society under the spur of competition.\n\nThe treatment is necessarily brief on account of the large number of topics to be covered, and also on account of the requirements of an elementary text book. The approach is functional. The authors stated in its preface the purpose is to present economic organization in its functional aspect, to show in some detail not so much what the organization is as how it operates.\n\nThe distinguishing feature of the volume is the effort to depict social structures in terms of what they do. The \"functions\", the \"uses\", the \"work\", of banks, of business organization, of competition, of specialization], of government, of scientific management, of education, and of other multitudinous agencies which together make up our want-gratifying machine, are the matters with which the book is concerned.\n\nAnd more even specific \"it is a study of the devices which exist in industrial society, primarily in terms of their activities, and, quite secondarily, in terms of their structures.\"\n\nIn a 1921 review of the work \"The American Economic Review,\" by Everett Walton Goodhue (1878-1940s), Professor of Sociology and Economics at Colgate University, Goodhue explained, that this work compares the economic organization to machine, and introduces a process approach (or systems approach) to economics. Goodhue (1921) explained.\n\nOur economic organization is compared to a machine with parts, articulation of parts, motive power, and control or guidance. No one claims that the machine at all times or perhaps at any time works perfectly. There are still many defects. Some parts are not well adapted to their uses; parts rattle, jam and squeak; too much or perchance at times too little motive power is applied; and at times (business depressions) the whole machine seems to break down. Despite the defects, however, the machine functions and is surprisingly well adapted to its purpose of producing goods in quantity, of producing them at right times, and of getting them into the hands of consumers with some accuracy and comparatively little difficulty.<br>The real test of any good machine is that it be designed for its purpose and that it accomplish that purpose at as low a cost as possible under the conditions which prevail at the time. Our economic machine appears to fulfill these conditions. On this point, indeed, many earnest students of economics honestly doubt the truth of the above statement. They see glaring faults of economy and justice, and take decided exception to the proposition that the present economic organization is adapted to its purpose. Possibly in the past, it is said, but certainly not today.\n\nThe complete work is illustrated with over 100 illustrations; tables, schemes, pictures, drawings, maps, graphs, block diagrams, tree diagrams, classification and organization charts, presenting a mix of empirical and theoretical data. The process approach is recognizable in the visualization of some specific economic phenomena in diagrams, such as the diagram of gratifying wants (see image).\n\nGoodhue (1921) further explained, that the book at the outset rather assumes human wants and the goods to gratify those wants. Its interest lies in the field of processes. The aim was to start the student in elementary economics with a study of our want gratifying machine, to show him how this machine has come to be, and how it serves its purpose in apportioning our social resources, viz: labor power, capital, acquired knowledge and natural resources to the production and sale of goods.\n\nAlthough this approach to economics in its time was somewhat new and rather unorthodox, nevertheless there was much to be said in its favor, according to Goodhue (1921):\n\nThere is no attempt to expound principles. All that is left to be taken up at a later point in the course. Those who have taught elementary economics will appreciate the difficulty of interesting and holding the students when they are plunged at the outset into the midst of the complexities of utility, value, and prices. This book goes far to solve that most difficult problem of arousing student interest in the course. It was considered eminently practical, readable, suggestive, and as such merits consideration.\n\nThe topics discussed in the book are in the main those of Professor Marshall's more pretentious work \"Readings in Industrial Society.\" The first two chapters on human wants and social resources aim to show the reasons for any form of economic organization.\n\nThen follow six chapters on English industrial history which, as the authors state, \"are not 'historical' in any orthodox sense of the term. They are a somewhat more extended view of the problem at issue.\" The remainder of the book is taken up with a functionalized description of the economic organization of the United States. There are four chapters on specialization, two on machine industry, three on business organization, three on the province of the enterpriser, two each on money and financial organization and the utilization of natural and human resources, and one on planning, guiding, and controlling.\n\nA 1921 review of this work by Goodhue, states that:\n... it is clear that what should be included, what should be excluded, where the emphasis should be placed is largely a matter of choice, and is somewhat dependent upon the purpose the authors have in mind. Not all topics which quite fall within the scope of the book can be equally well treated, especially if the work is elementary in character. It may be a source of disappointment to certain readers that the authors have done little more than to suggest or imply at some points in their discussion the motive forces of organization. We find comparatively little on gain-seeking, prices, competition, property, contract, and the necessities for interdependence.\nAnd furthermore:\nThe book does not pretend to cover the entire field of economics. It is designed merely as an introductory text and can well be combined with some one of the standard works on the \"Principles of Economics.\" As a stimulating, attractive, readable book it is a great success. The authors should be complimented on making available this material on economic organization in such a clear and teachable form. The practical questions at the end of each chapter are helpful and suggestive, and add a good deal to the teachable qualities of the book.\n\n\n This article incorporates public domain material from the 1921 review by Everett W. Goodhue.\n\n"}

NFIB is a non-profit that works to defend the right of small business owners to own and operate their businesses without undue government interference. Its political action committee is called Save America's Free Enterprise Trust.\n\nNFIB was founded by C. Wilson Harder in 1943 and maintained its headquarters in San Mateo, California, until 1992 when it was relocated to Nashville, TN. Harder began with a home office and sold the first memberships to his neighbors. His vision was to give small and independent business a voice in governmental decision-making through political advocacy. Since its early history, NFIB's political agenda has been determined through a one-vote balloting process of its membership.\n\nHarder was succeeded in 1969 by his son John, who was replaced just six months later by Wilson S. Johnson. Under Johnson, member Action Councils were created, which still exist today, known as Leadership Councils. Through this time, NFIB also began to gain greater recognition in Washington, D.C., and in state capitals.\n\nJohn Sloan became President of NFIB in 1983. He was the first chief executive to be brought in from outside the organization. Sloan installed a business structure with a sales manager, finance and administration directed by the CFO (both in San Mateo), and expanded the organization's presence with a public policy operation in Washington, DC.\n\nIn 1983, the organization established the NFIB Member Services Corporation. The Corporation is wholly owned by NFIB. Its purpose is to offer preferred-provider member benefit programs to assist members in reducing operating costs. Programs include worker's compensation insurance, commercial and personal health insurance, credit card processing, operational supplies, and discounts on commonly used business products and services.\n\nIn 1992, following the death of John Sloan, Jack Faris assumed the role of President and clearly defined NFIB's role in affecting public policy at the state and federal levels through political and grassroots activism, and lobbying with lawmakers in an integrated manner. In 1992, NFIB headquarters were officially relocated to Nashville, TN.\n\nJack Faris announced his retirement in early 2005. The board formed a search committee and selected Todd A. Stottlemyer as the fifth President of NFIB. Stottlemyer took the reins of NFIB on February 15, 2006, with a goal of improving NFIB's non-partisan reach and technology infrastructure.\n\nIn February 2009, Dan Danner became the sixth president of NFIB and served until February 2016. Under Danner's leadership, NFIB proved to be a driving force in opposing major governmental regulations; in 2012 it gained historical recognition as the only business association to challenge President Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as a party to the Supreme Court case \"National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius\".\n\nFollowing Danner's retirement, Juanita Duggan was named President and CEO in February 2016. Duggan has taken the lead in establishing NFIB as the source for definitive information on prospective Supreme Court Justices, with regard to their stance on business issues. Recognizing the enduring impact judges can have on the business environment for independent business.\n\nNFIB has grown from Harder's for-profit entrepreneurial vision in 1943 to the non-profit national association of more than 325,000 members it is today.\n\nOn its website, the National Federation of Independent Business states that it is a \"nonprofit, nonpartisan organization founded in 1943\" and \"represents the consensus views of its members in Washington and all 50 state capitals.\" Its PAC is called Save America's Free Enterprise Trust (SAFE).\n\nIn 2010, 25 of its members, all Republican, were elected to the 112th Congress. A number of them, such as Rand Paul, Jeff Duncan, Paul Gosar and Kristi Noem, are affiliated with or endorsed by the Tea Party movement.\n\nAlso in 2010, the NFIB became the lead plaintiff opposing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act health care reform legislation. The organization joined 26 states in the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the act. The case was picked up by the Supreme Court, which issued its ruling on \"National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius\" on June 28, 2012, upholding most provisions of the act. Karl Rove's conservative Crossroads GPS PAC gave NFIB $3.7 million to help fund the court fight. Meanwhile, many other small business advocates supported PPACA.\n\nThe NFIB supported the America's Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2014 (H.R. 4457; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code, which mostly affects small- to medium-sized businesses, to retroactively and permanently extend from January 1, 2014, increased limitations on the amount of investment that can be immediately deducted from taxable income. The bill would return the tax code to its 2013 status and make the change permanent. Dan Danner, the president and CEO at that time, argued that Congress could help small business by passing the bill as it would enable small businesses to \"plan for the future, invest in the economy and hire new workers.\"\n\nIN 2017, NFIB endorsed confirmation of SCOTUS nominee Neil Gorsuch.\n\n\n"}

Carlsen was one of the biggest ship owners in Norway of his time. \n\nCarlsen was born in Drøbak in Akershus, Norway. He was the son of Jacob Carlsen (ca. 1685-1749) and Maria Jørgensdatter Frost. His father had married the widow of his employer and took over the trading business. Drøbak had a favorable location situated on east side of Drøbak Sound, at the narrowest part of the Oslo Fjord. It was near the capital, had good anchoring and mooring facilities and a protective harbor. \n\nNiels Carlsen and his half brothers Christian went into their father's business and expanded it. The brothers were shipowners, forest owners, traded in both imports and exports and took part in the financing operations that came with the profession. Carlsen bought up forest lands on both sides of the bay, floated the logs into circulation plots which he had acquired along Drøbak Sound, operated a sawmill and built bulwark against the sea to facilitate the loading of ships. He owned a large part of the property along the seafront as well as the small islands where Oscarsborg Fortress is now situated. With these acquisition, he initiated the operation of a ferry landing, plus guest house and coaching inn.\n\nCarlsen married Martha Zachariassen (1743–1821), the daughter of Zacharias Simonsen Wesseltoft (1701-1777), a wealthy merchant and shipowner in Skien. She and her family contributed to the further development of Carlsen's business and to the development of Drøbak. Carlsen and his wife donated funds for a wooden cruciform church, hospital and school. Drøbak Church (\"Drøbak kirke\") was fully furnished and was inaugurated in 1776. Facing the church is the building which was dedicated as a hospital and hostel for poor widows in 1793.

The agreement is one of the three alternatives authorized under Ireland's Personal Insolvency Act 2012; Debt Settlement Arrangements (DSA) and Debt Relief Notices (DRN) make the other two arrangements. PIA mandates a legal agreement between a debtor and their creditors, which is mediated and administered by a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP). A PIA usually lasts for a term of six years and must include both unsecured debt and secured debts.\n\nEligibility criteria for a debtor include:\nFurthermore, a debtor must not have any agreements mandated under the instant Act, bankrupt nor accumulated 25% or more of their total debt during the previous 6 months\n\nPersonal Insolvency Act 2012 envisages that Personal Insolvency Arrangements can only be applied for through an approved third party termed as Personal Insolvency Practitioners. The practitioners are required to be authorised by the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) and include Solicitors Barristers, Qualified accountants, qualified financial advisers etc. Till 31 October 2013, it was announced that there are a total of 72 registered Personal Insolvency Practitioners.\n\nThe type of debts that can be included in a PIA are split into three types; Included, Excludable and Excluded.\n\nInitially, the debtor is required to approach a PIP to provide a full disclosure of his or her financial situation. After appraisal, the PIP suggests best possible agreement. If recommended, the debtor can proceed with the PIA application and appoint the PIP to act on their behalf. A Prescribed Financial Statement is then prepared for the debtor. which details key information about a debtor’s finances and clearly shows their insolvent status. It must be fully supported by appropriate financial documentation, such as pay slips, bank statements etc. A statutory declaration in the presence of witnesses to confirm the Prescribed Financial Statement is true and accurate, plus completes and signs the additional documents needed to accompany the Statement to apply for a Protective Certificate. The full application is sent to the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI).\n\nA court is authorized to issue a Protective Certificate to the debtor, which provides PIP and the debtor 70 days protection against creditor for preparation of a PIA proposal.\n\nAfter issuance of Protective Certificate, PIP has been mandated to prepare a draft PIA. During the process, the market value of the secured assets can either be agreed between the debtor, creditor and PIP or services of independent valuer can be solicited.\n\nSequel to debtor’s agreement on the PIA proposal, the PIP is required to call a creditors' meeting in which through voting, creditors representing at least 65% of the total debts – 50% of the unsecured and 50% of the secured – must agree to the proposal. After approval in the vote, the documents are required to be forwarded to ISI, which will notify the Circuit Court. Thus final approval sits with the court, and any creditor's objection will be considered by them.\nThe law requires that after approval the debtor’s name, address details, birth year and PIA start date o be made available on the ISI website.\n\nAfter formal approval by the courts and notification with ISI, debtors are required to set up payments to the PIP, which in turn distribute the payments to creditors as per agreements. A PIA has a lifespan of six years.\n\nIf a debtor completes all of their obligations under the PIA, the agreement is considered complete. At completion, PIP through creditors finalize the treatment of the remaining balances debt; unsecured debt balances will be written off, while secured debt balances are discharged as per the PIA agreement. The PIP coordinates the removal of debtor’s information from the Register of Personal Insolvency Arrangements within three months, making the debtor solvent.\n\nA PIA will be deemed to have failed if creditors do not agree to the PIA or if the debtor fails to maintain his or her duties and obligations.\nThis can be avoided if a debtor can anticipate a potential problem keeping up with payments, because their PIP may be able to arrange a variation with creditors to ensure a way can be found to continue with the PIA and prevent it from failing.\n\nIn the UK, a similar arrangement exists under the name of individual voluntary arrangement (IVA). IVA has been mandated under the Insolvency Act 1986.\n\n"}

It applies to fields such as computers (software, hardware, networks, etc.), business processes (enterprise architecture, policy and procedures, logistics, project management, etc.), and any other process system of varying degrees of complexity.\n\nProcesses are defined as having inputs, outputs and the energy required to transform inputs to outputs. Use of energy during transformation also implies a passage of time: a process takes real time to perform its associated action. A process also requires space for input/output objects and transforming objects to exist: a process uses real space.\n\nA process system is a specialized system of processes. Processes are composed of processes. Complex processes are made up of several processes that are in turn made up of several processes. This results in an overall structural hierarchy of abstraction. If the process system is studied hierarchically, it is easier to understand and manage; therefore, process architecture requires the ability to consider process systems hierarchically. Graphical modeling of process architectures is considered by dualistic Petri nets. Mathematical consideration of process architectures may be found in CCS and the π-calculus.\n\nThe structure of a process system, or its architecture, can be viewed as a dualistic relationship of its infrastructure and suprastructure. The infrastructure describes a process system's component parts and their interactions. The suprastructure considers the super system of which the process system is a part. (Suprastructure should not be confused with superstructure, which is actually part of the infrastructure built for (external) support.) As one traverses the process architecture from one level of abstraction to the next, infrastructure becomes the basis for suprastructure and vice versa as one looks within a system or without. \n\nRequirements for a process system are derived at every hierarchical level. Black-box requirements for a system come from its suprastructure. Customer requirements are black-box requirements near, if not at, the top of a process architecture's hierarchy. White-box requirements, such as engineering rules, programming syntax, etc., come from the process system's infrastructure.\n\nProcess systems are a dualistic phenomenon of change/no-change or form/transform and as such, are \nwell-suited to being modeled by the bipartite Petri nets modeling system and in particular, process-class dualistic Petri nets where processes can be simulated in real time and space and studied hierarchically.\n"}

The materials includes latex, natural rubber, synthetic rubber and other polymeric materials, such as thermoplastic elastomers. Rubber processed through such methods are components of a wide range of items.\n\nMost rubber products are vulcanized, a process which involves heating with a small quantity of sulphur (or equivalent cross-linking agent) so as to stabilise the polymer chains, over a wide range of temperature. This discovery was made by Charles Goodyear in the 1844, but is a process restricted to polymer chains having a Double bond in the backbone. Such materials include natural rubber and polybutadiene. The range of materials available is much wider however, since all polymers become elastomeric above their Glass transition temperature. However, the elastomeric state is unstable because chains can slip past one another resulting in creep or stress relaxation under static or dynamic load conditions. Chemical cross links add the stability to the network that is needed for most practical applications.\n\nWORKER PROCESSING RUBBER\n\nMethods for processing rubber include mastication and various operations like mixing, calendering, extrusion, all processes being essential to bring crude rubber into a state suitable for shaping the final product. The former breaks down the polymer chains, and lowers their molecular mass so that viscosity is low enough for further processing. After this has been achieved, various additions can be made to the material ready for cross-linking. Rubber may be masticated on a two-roll mill or in an industrial mixer, which come in different types.\n\nRubber is first compounded with additives like sulfur, carbon black and accelerators. It is converted into a dough-like mixture which is called \"compound\" then milled into sheets of desired thickness. Rubber may then be extruded or molded before being cured.\n\n"}

In 1841, the family moved to Moscow. From 1852, he studied in St. Petersburg, and later at the Moscow University. \n\nIn 1864, Savva visited Italy where he began to take lessons in singing. There he was introduced to the daughter of Moscow merchant Grigory Sapozhnikov, 17-year-old Elizabeth, who subsequently became his wife. The wedding took place in 1865 at the Kireevo estate, near Khimki, just northwest of Moscow.\n\nIn 1869, he became a director of the Moscow-Yaroslavl railway. It was he who supervised the construction of the Severnaya Railway linking Moscow with the Russian North. He was also involved with the building of the Donetsk railway from 1876 to 1882. \n\nIn 1870, Mamontov purchased the Abramtsevo Estate, located north of Moscow, and founded there an artists' colony which included most of the best Russian artists of the beginning of the 20th century, such as Konstantin Korovin, Rafail Levitsky, Mikhail Nesterov, Ilya Repin, Vasily Polenov, Valentin Serov, Mikhail Vrubel, the brothers Vasnetsov, sculptors Viktor Hartmann and Mark Antokolsky, as well as various others. The colony of artists who were hosted there during the 1870s and 1880s sought to recapture the quality and spirit of medieval Russian art. Several workshops were set up there to produce handmade furniture, ceramic tiles, and silks imbued with traditional Russian imagery and themes. \n\nMamontov also patronised the Russian Private Opera which discovered the great Russian bass, Chaliapin, and supported the Russian opera composers, Pyotr Tchaikovsky, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Alexander Borodin, Modest Musorgsky, and many others. Drama and opera on Russian folklore themes (e.g., Rimsky-Korsakov's \"The Snow Maiden\") were produced at Abramtsevo by the likes of Konstantin Stanislavsky, with sets contributed by the brothers Vasnetsov, Mikhail Vrubel, and other distinguished artists. \"The Russian Private Opera\" was Mamontov's main contribution to the arts. Mamontov acted as a stage director, a conductor and a teacher of singing. \n\nThe success of the \"Private Opera\" in the provinces was followed by a triumph in Moscow. However, Mamontov's world came crashing down when, in 1899-1900, Mamontov was unjustly accused of embezzlement during the building of the Yaroslavl railway. He was arrested and put on trial.\n\n\n\nThird Eye Blind's song \"Monotov's Private Opera\" from the album \"Ursa Major\" is inspired by Mamontov's private opera.\n\n\n"}

They are typically found in countries which are governed by a British style of parliamentary democracy such as the UK and British Commonwealth countries like Canada, Australia, New Zealand and India. They are also found in Israel and elsewhere. In Britain, many such bodies are termed QUANGOs because of their semi-autonomous nature.\n\nFederal statutory authorities are typically established under the \"Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997\"(Repealed). Statutory authorities at the State or Territory level are established under corresponding State or Territory laws. Each statutory authority tends to have its own enabling legislation, or originating act, even if it was established before the relevant over-riding legislation, For example, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) was established in 1949 by the \"Science and Industry Research Act\", but it has since come under the jurisdiction of the \"Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997\" as legislation covering statutory authorities has evolved.\n\nLaws made by statutory authorities are usually referred to as regulations. They are not cited in the same fashion as an act of parliament, but usually with specific initials (depending on the authority) and a number.\n\nJust as Laws enacted by Parliament, all laws made by a statutory authority must be published in the Government Gazette.\n\nThe Parliament of Australia, or a State or Territory Parliament, will delegate its Authority to a statutory authority for several reasons;\n\n\nThe power to enact legislation has been delegated by Australian Parliaments (State and/or Federal) in the following areas;\n\n\n\n"}

In 2007, BBC News described it as \"one of Nigeria's most respected business magazines\".\n\n\"Tell\" magazine published its first edition on 15 April 1991. All five of the founding editors had worked at \"Newswatch\", where they learned to create in-depth, investigative feature stories. They left that magazine due to low pay and disagreements with senior management, hoping that the new magazine would be more fulfilling. Although the magazine's founders had high ambitions, they were not initially hostile to the government. However, they were determined to be free of government or political influence.\n\nThe magazine questioned whether General Ibrahim Babangida was sincere in saying he would hand over to a civilian government. \nThe 2 May 1993 edition with headline \"Transition: 21 Traps against handover\" was seized, and had to be reprinted in tabloid format. Two more major seizures occurred before Babangida was forced from power in August 1993.\nIn all, 500,000 copies were seized in the last four months of Babangida's rule.\nTell's circulation rose to as many as 100,000 copies each week in the build-up to the June 1993 presidential election and in the subsequent confusion.\nFacing harassment from security forces, the magazine began printing underground in July 1993.\nOn 15 August 1993 police raided the offices and arrested editor-in-chief Nosa Igiebor and editors Kola Ilori, Onome Osifo-Whiskey and Ayodele Akinkuoto. holding them for 12 days.\n\nConditions became more difficult after General Sani Abacha took power in November 1993.\nOn 2 January 1994 armed policemen and security officers seized 50,000 copies of the magazine at the printer's premises. The issue was titled \"The Return of Tyranny - Abacha bares his fangs\".\nThe editors resorted to guerrilla tactics to survive, forming cells and frequently moving, with the magazine printed covertly in different locations. They relied on help from civilians, who supported the magazine by providing office space, buying copies and helping in many other ways.\n\nAfter the newspaper published a story that revealed that Abacha was suffering from cirrhosis of the liver, police and military raided Igiebor's house while he was away. His wife was maltreated when she said she did not know where he was. A soldier pointed a gun at his four-year-old daughter, threatening to shoot if Igiebor was not produced.\nIgiebor was jailed for six months from late 1995 to 1996, and later fled abroad to escape the threat of assassination. Osifo-Whiskey also spent six months in detention, arrested after a year in which he avoided his own house and stayed with friends, one of whom was killed.\n\nIn 1993, the Committee to Protect Journalists presented Igiebor its International Press Freedom Award, \"an annual recognition of courageous journalism\", for his work with the magazine. In 1998, Nosa Igiebor and the staff as a whole were awarded the Special Award for Human Rights Journalism Under Threat at the Amnesty International UK Media Awards. The award's notice stated; \"Tell has continued to publish throughout the period of Nigerian dictatorship despite intimidation, harassment and the detention without charge or trial of Mr Igiebor and other senior members of the Tell staff.\"\n"}

Situated on the north-west corner of Wall Street and Water Street, it was built by a group of stockbrokers to serve as a meeting place for trade and correspondence. It was organized as a tontine, a type of investment plan, and funded by the sale of 203 shares of £200 each. The May 17, 1792, creation of the Buttonwood Agreement, which bound its signatories to trade only with each other, effectively gave rise to a new organization of tradespeople. \n\nIn its prime, the Tontine was among New York City's busiest centers for the buying and selling of stocks and other wares, for business dealings and discussion, and for political transaction. Having had a dual function as a combination club and a meeting room, the coffee house played host to auctions, banquets, and balls, among others. After hours, gambling and securities dealings were that were then deemed less than honest. The coffee house also provided a place for the registration of ship cargo and the trading of slaves. The Tontine was noted as classless; individuals from all social strata met there and collectively engaged in the many civil and economic affairs. John Lambert, an English traveller, wrote in 1807:\n\nPolitical demonstrations and violence were not uncommon at the Tontine Coffee House. In the wake of the French Revolution, fistfights between those respectively sympathetic to the British and the French broke out on a daily basis. An anonymous observer wrote:\nOn one occasion, French Revolutionists and supporters of the Tammany Hall movement scaled the coffee house and placed a French Liberty Cap on the roof. Several New York publications mentioned the particular, those newspapers with pro-Jacobin or pro–Democratic-Republican slants applauded the perpetrators and encouraged the Tontine's proprietors to allow the Cap to remain. In addition, an onlooker named Alexander Anderson describes conflict between Whigs and Torys at the Tontine in a June 11, 1793, diary entry:\nIn December 1793, New York's \"Columbian Gazetteer\" complained that \"only persons of the same party\" would now associate within the Tontine.\n\nTrading at the Tontine Coffee House continued until 1817. The growth of the Tontine's trade proceedings had effected the creation of the New York Stock and Exchange Board (NYSEB) and necessitated a larger venue. The NYSEB is recognised as the precursor to the present-day New York Stock Exchange, the largest stock exchange in the world. The Tontine itself was transformed into a tavern by a John Morse in 1826, and a hotel by Lovejoy & Belcher in 1832. It survived the Great Fire of 1835 and was demolished 20 years later.\n\n\n"}

It is served by the 4 train at all times and the 5 train at all times except late nights.\n\nThis station opened on June 12, 1905, as a one-stop extension of the original subway from Fulton Street.\n\nOn January 6, 1994, Automated Fare Collection turnstiles went into service at this station, and at the Whitehall Street station.\n\nIn 1995, as a result of service reductions, the MTA was considering permanently closing one of the two Wall Street stations, as well as two other stations citywide, due to their proximity to each other. Either the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line or the IRT Lexington Avenue Line station would have been closed.\n\nWall Street is an underground, two-tracked station, with two side platforms that are slightly offset from one another.\n\nThe standard IRT name tablet mosaics are original as well as the fancy ceiling accents and the iron pillars. On the southbound platform is a wooden token booth and ticket chopper, wooden restroom doors on each side. The walls on the platforms are clad in pink stone at the bottom, followed by white tiles, the name of the station in white letters and blue mosaics, and decorated tiles at the top. The top part is decorated with tiles depicting vines or artistic depictions of a New Amsterdam stapled colonial house with the palisade wall in front of it, which gave today's Wall Street its name.\n\nThe entrances are covered with curved metal roofs painted green. The metal is sculpted with patterns made to resemble wood or leaves.\n\nThere is a crossunder about midway along the length of the platforms, and a lesser-used one at the north end.\n\nThere are three exit areas. On the south end, between Rector Street and Exchange Place, there are two exits to either side of Broadway, with the northbound exits on the east side and the southbound exits on the west side. There are faux kiosks on the southbound side.\n\nA complex underground passageway exists outside the fare control which connects to the Broad Street station on the BMT Nassau Street Line, and to the Wall Street station on the Brooklyn Branch of the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line. This passageway also leads to the Chase Manhattan Plaza and the old Equitable Building. The stations have a shared exit to the eastern corner of Cedar and Nassau Streets.\n\nOn the north end on the southbound side only, there is an exit under the Trinity Building. It has an opulent gold-colored banner proclaiming \"SUBWAY ENTRANCE\" atop the entrance, which is half a flight below ground. The exit also has a Subway restaurant outside fare control.\n\nThe original white tiles from the early 20th century were walled over with glossy dark blue tiles in the 1970s, with only the name of station allowed to stay. Similar remodeling work was done during that time with 51st Street station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, using beige tiles.\n\nIn 2006, a project to renovate/restore the station back to its original appearance began. As of May 2006, the blue tiles mentioned above had been removed and remnants of the original white tile-work exposed. The condition of the original tiles were fair to poor to completely missing. All missing tiles were refitted based on original models.\n\n\n"}
