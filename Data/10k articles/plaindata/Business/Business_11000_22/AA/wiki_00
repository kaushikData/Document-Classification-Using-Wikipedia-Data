Khan has led Summit Group from starting as Bangladesh's first private sector power producer to a diversified group with investments across power, energy trading, port, telecommunications, hospitality and real estate.\n\nKhan has led Summit in building partnerships with multinationals such as GE, IFC and Wartsila. while securing billions of dollars in financing for infrastructure projects within Bangladesh. Khan pledged to invest another $3 billion into Bangladesh's energy sector.\n\nKhan, his wife and three family members have been named by the ICIJ as operating six offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands using a Singapore address. Summit itself states that it does not have any association with these scandals.\n\nKhan is the son of an army officer. His first steps as an businessman were taken with a friend, whose father's death thrust him into the family import business. The 18-year-old Khan borrowed Tk 30,000 from his father to partner in the venture in 1973.\n\nHe received an MBA in 1980 from the Institute of Business Administration, University of Dhaka (IBA). He studied in Armanitola Government High School and Notredame College, Dhaka.\n\nUnder the leadership of Khan, Summit Group set up the country's first independent power plant in 1998, Khulna Power Company Limited.\n\nSummit set up the country's first private off-dock facility, Ocean Containers Limited, now known as Summit Alliance Ports Limited which is currently handling about 30% of the country's export and about 10% of the country's import volume.\n\nSummit Communications Ltd is the first company to lay nationwide telecommunication transmission network laying fibre optic to 70% of Bangladesh, and connecting Bangladesh to India and Myanmar through terrestrial fibre optics.\n\nIPCO Ltd, a hospitality and real estate company, is building one five star and one three star hotels, a convention hall and 1000 shops beside the International Airport of Dhaka.\n\nIn 2011, Khan led Summit Group in establishing a joint venture with GE to build plants generating 327 megawatts of electricity for Bangladesh. This joint venture secured funding of $327 million, including $112 million from the World Bank.\n\nIn 2012, Khan led Summit Group in establishing a joint venture with China Energy Group, the largest government-owned Chinese company, to build various power projects, including a 341 megawatt power plant with a $220 million deal for China Energy Group to provide construction and engineering services.\n\nIn 2015, Khan was elected president of the Bangladesh Association of Publicly Listed Companies. He also led Summit Group in winning a deal to build Bangladesh's first high-tech business park, agreeing to invest $207 million to build part of the park across its 232-acre land in Kaliakor, Bangladesh.\n\nIn April 2016, Khan, his wife Anjuman Aziz Khan, daughter Ayesha Aziz Khan, brother Zafar Umayyad Khan and nephew Faisal Karim Khan were named in the Panama Papers as operating six offshore companies, mostly in the British Virgin Islands using a Singapore address. Summit Group states that it has no business in any form in Panama, nor it has any link with the legal firm Mossack Fonseca, and that there has not been any mention whatsoever of Khan in \"The Panama Papers\". The National Board of Revenue (NBR) has started an investigation into the money laundering and tax evasion histories of 25 Bangladeshi politicians and businessmen, including Khan; and the Anti Corruption Commission Bangladesh (ACC) has created a three-member committee to investigate. However, the Bangladesh-based British journalist David Bergman has clarified that the only Bangladeshi people linked to offshore companies as released by the ICIJ relate to an earlier 2013 leak of information involving the British Virgin Islands.\n\nIn May 2016, Khan was appointed Honorary Consul General of Finland in Bangladesh due to his long-standing business relationship with Finland. In particular, Aziz Khan has led Summit Group in building close trade relationships with leading Finnish company Wartsila, who has supplied machinery and equipment to many of the Summit Group's power project.\n\nAlso in 2016, Khan led Summit Group in securing $190 million in a consortium led by Standard Chartered to finance a $335 megawatt power plant. Khan also helped arranged the largest ever direct loan given to a Bangladeshi company in 2016 for $210 million by Asian Development Bank, International Finance Corporation and Islamic Development Bank. Khan has also indicated that Summit may list on the Singapore Stock Exchange, making it the first Bangladeshi company to do so.\n\nIn September 2016, Khan announced that Summit Group has established a Singaporean company that it will publicly list in Singapore and help raise $2.5 billion to invest in Bangladesh projects such as a liquified natural gas terminal and additional power capacity.\n\nIn January 2017, Summit Group announced that it would build a $500 million LNG terminal in Moheshkhali, Bangladesh. The project brings GE as an equity partner. Khan has said, \"We want to ensure constant supply of primary energy for the country by implementing this project.\"\n\nIn 2018, Forbes Asia listed Khan and family 34th richest in Singapore.\n\nIn August 2018, Mitsubishi Corporation acquired 25% of Summit LNG Terminal Co (Pvt) Ltd.

(BIAN)\n\nThe Banking Industry Architecture Network e.V. (BIAN) is an independent, member owned, not-for-profit association to establish and promote a common architectural framework for enabling banking interoperability. It was established in 2008.\n\nBIAN's goal is to establish a semantic framework to identify and define IT services in the banking industry. The underlying architectural pattern originates from a service-oriented architecture (SOA).\n\nThe community focuses on creating a standard semantic banking services landscape, while ensuring consistent service definitions, levels of detail and boundaries. This will enable banks to achieve a reduction of integration costs and use the advantages of a service-oriented architecture of implementing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software.\n\nFinancial institutions, software vendors, and system integrators, along with technology partners, are invited to join the association and play a collaborative role with other industry leaders in defining, building and implementing next-generation banking platforms.\n\nBanks are facing challenges that will eventually force them to decompose their business and IT landscape into independent but interlinked units and are therefore looking for better means of interaction in their systems.\n\nThe banking environment consists of many legacy systems that have, over the years, grown in complexity and become increasingly inflexible.\n\nBIAN is defining a common framework as a base for a shared service-oriented catalogue for the banking industry with the goal of establishing a common language. Based on broad consensus from within the banking industry, this will enable faster, more efficient strategic and operational changes in banks.\n\nTo assist and guide the banking industry in achieving an architecture closely aligned with business objectives, leading banks are sharing their requirements for core services with leading software and services vendors to implement these services based on formally defined semantics. BIAN is a global, open, independent and unique community where banks, software providers, and system integrators openly exchange banking IT requirements with regard to interaction and integration.\n\nBIAN brings banks, vendors of banking applications, and service providers together as a community to achieve synergies by collaborating on a consensus understanding of the requirements for banking enterprise services within an SOA framework and a formal description of a banking services landscape canonical definitions.\n\nEmploying an architectural framework to foster proper definition of services, BIAN will help banks and providers move from proprietary to broadly accepted and standardized services. BIAN also represents a repository of non-proprietary knowledge and experience dedicated to supporting the roadmaps for all banks moving towards SOA.\n\nBIAN will offer the industry assistance in:\n\nThe BIAN standards are provided from the BIAN working groups. BIAN working groups collaborate, sharing knowledge and experience around SOA for the banking industry with a current focus on core systems. The working groups focus on defining services within an agreed overall common services landscape.\n\nBIAN is focused on semantic definitions only. Definition of business functional services for retail banking, private banking and corporate banking.\n\nIn the stream Architecture BIAN defines the appropriate guidelines and methodologies and all the concepts to ensure consistent services:\n\nThe BIAN Service Landscape is a reference framework that categorizes and organizes BIAN Service Domains for ease of access. Different criteria can be used to classify and organize Service Domains that would result in different layouts of the standard set of BIAN Service Domains. BIAN uses a ‘primary’ Service Landscape view based on agreed categorizations that have been refined in use by the BIAN membership.\n\nThe BIAN Metamodel is a detailed and comprehensive UML model that defines all the BIAN design structures – it is fully documented elsewhere in its own guide (The BIAN Metamodel). The Metamodel has three elements that capture the design of the BIAN Service Landscape.\n\nBIAN is in partnership with independent standards bodies such as Object Management Group (OMG) and The Open Group and IFX Forum. In addition, BIAN has a ‘category D liaison’ with the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), for ISO 20022 semantic models. BIAN incorporates when possible the work of these organizations. As an example, the BIAN Metamodel is closely aligned to, and draws on parts of, the ISO20022 Meta Model for many of the detailed definitional aspects. These working partnerships mark a big step forward in BIAN’s commitment to complimentary standards collaboration.\nThe TOGAF standard and the BIAN standard are mapped to each other. The leverage of the BIAN deliverables in the context of the TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM) is further elaborated. For each step in an architecture development process, the integration of BIAN deliverables is described.\n\nMembers of BIAN drive the banking industry by understanding the requirements and trends as well as by designing and providing new IT-solutions therefore.\nThe association lives by the participation of its members. BIAN members contribute actively in the association. However the degree of involvement can vary according to multiple aspects. Influencing for the involvement are e.g. the role within BIAN, specific working topics and the current projects within BIAN and the own company.\n\n"}

It stars James Garner as F. Ross Johnson, the CEO of RJR Nabisco, and Jonathan Pryce as Henry Kravis, his chief rival for the company. It also features Peter Riegert, Joanna Cassidy and Fred Dalton Thompson.\n\nThe film won both the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie and the Golden Globe for Best Television Movie while James Garner won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Miniseries or Movie. FOX also aired the film later in the same year.\n\nSelf-made multimillionaire and RJR Nabisco CEO F. Ross Johnson decides to take the tobacco and food conglomerate company private in 1988 after receiving advance news of the likely market failure of the company's smokeless cigarette called Premier, the development of which had been intended to finally boost the company's stock price.\n\nThe free-spending Johnson's bid for the company is opposed by two of the pioneers of the leveraged buyout, Henry Kravis and his cousin. Kravis feels betrayed when, after Johnson initially discusses doing the LBO with Kravis, he takes the potentially enormous deal to another firm, the Shearson Lehman Hutton division of American Express.\n\nOther bidders emerge, including Ted Forstmann and his company, Forstmann Little, after Kravis and Johnson are unable to reconcile their differences. The bidding goes to unprecedented heights, and when executive Charles Hugel becomes aware of how much Johnson stands to profit in a transaction that will put thousands of Nabisco employees out of work, he quips, \"Now I know what the 'F' in F. Ross Johnson stands for.\" The greed was so evident, Kravis's final bid is declared the winner, even though Johnson's was higher.\n\nThe title of the book and movie comes from a statement by Forstmann in which he calls that Kravis' money \"phoney junk bond crap\" and how he and his brother are \"real people with real money,\" and that to stop raiders like Kravis: \"We need to push the barbarians back from the city gates.\"\n\nIn the podcast \"Comedy Bang Bang\", comedian Paul Rust refers to the film in the prologue to his popular segment \"New No-Nos\", while discussing a run-in with Nabisco concerning Chex Mix.\n"}

The term originates in finance, but the concept has been applied widely since. \n\nIn economics and business, specifically cost accounting, the break-even point (BEP) is the point at which cost or expenses and revenue are equal: there is no net loss or gain, and one has \"broken even.\" A profit or a loss has not been made, although opportunity costs have been \"paid\" and capital has received the risk-adjusted, expected return. In other words, it´s the point in which the total revenue of a business exceed its total costs, and the business begins to create wealth instead of consuming it. It is shown graphically as the point where the total revenue and total cost curves meet. In the linear case the break-even point is equal to the fixed costs divided by the contribution margin per unit.\n\nThe break-even point is achieved when the generated profits match the total costs accumulated until the date of profit generation. Establishing the break-even point helps businesses in setting plans for the levels of production which it needs to maintain be profitable.\n\nThe accounting method of calculating break-even point does not include cost of working capital. The financial method of calculating break-even, called value added break-even analysis, is used to assess the feasibility of a project. This method not only accounts for all costs, it also includes the opportunity costs of the capital required to develop a project.\n\nIn nuclear fusion research, the term \"break-even\" refers to a fusion energy gain factor equal to unity; this is also known as the Lawson criterion. The notion can also be found in more general phenomena, such as percolation. In energy, the break-even point is the point where usable energy gotten from a process equals the input energy.\n\nIn computer science, the term (used infrequently) refers to a point in the life cycle of a programming language where the language can be used to code its own compiler or interpreter. This is also called self-hosting.\n\nIn medicine, it is a postulated state when the advances of medicine permit every year an increase of one year or more of the life expectancy \"of the living\", therefore leading to medical immortality, barring accidental death.\n\nIn soccer, the break-even requirement was adopted by UEFA with the purpose of prohibiting clubs from spending more money on transfers than they actually earn as businesses, i.e. revenue per each fiscal year excluding donations from sponsors or advertisers.\n"}

The magazine is published by Allured Business Media. It is delivered to 97 countries on a monthly basis, and is geared toward formulators, scientists, researchers, chemists and R&D management in the industry. The magazine is available in both print and online magazine format. The headquarters is in Northbrook, Illinois.\n\nThe publication began in March 1906 as \"The American Perfumer\", a monthly magazine published by Ungerer & Company. In September 1906, the name changed to \"The American Perfumer and Essential Oil Review\", and the publisher changed to The Perfumer Publishing Company. At that time, the perfumery business was more prominent than cosmetics.\nBy 1935, the Moore Publishing Company bought the magazine. In 1956, Maison G. deNavarre had been writing and editing for the magazine for 24 years, and in January of that year, the owners again changed the magazine’s name to \"American Perfumer and Aromatics\". The publication focused on perfumery, aromatics and flavors, but deNavarre incorporated the occasional personal care product; for example, hand creams and royal jelly. In the early years of the magazine, there was no mandatory labeling of product ingredients, and cosmetic companies were afraid to have their scientists publish for fear of giving away trade secrets.\n\nIn March 1960, the Allured family purchased the \"American Perfumer and Aromatics\" from Moore Publishing. In 1961, the name was changed again to \"American Perfumer and Cosmetics\". The owners explained this change in the June 1962 issue:\n“The change in name that you see on the cover, and on top of this page, is in belated recognition of an editorial fact of over 30 years’ duration. During this period this magazine has gradually meant more and more to the cosmetic chemist and pharmacist, as these specialties became the major customer for fragrances. In turn, the perfumer has been more and more involved in the technical problems that new cosmetic materials have forced upon him.”\n\nIn January 1972 the name was changed to \"American Cosmetics and Perfumery\", recognizing the changes taking place in cosmetic raw materials, cosmetic research and development, and cosmetic business in general. The publisher, Stanley E. Allured, believed the future of the personal care industry existed in new cosmetic raw materials and in new cosmetic product ideas. He would canvass cosmetics companies and hold meetings with R&D vice presidents and laboratory managers to determine what should be covered in the magazine, as well as to encourage them to write articles for the magazine.\nIn 1973 the title was changed again to \"Cosmetics and Perfumery\". In January 1976, the publication was divided into two separate magazines: \"Perfumer & Flavorist\" and \"Cosmetics and Toiletries\". In January 1979, an ampersand was substituted in \"Cosmetics and Toiletries\" to produce the current title, \"Cosmetics & Toiletries\".\n\n\"Cosmetics & Toiletries Brazil\" is the Brazilian version of \"Cosmetics & Toiletries\" magazine, published nine times per year in Portuguese.\n\n\"Cosmetics & Toiletries E-newsletter\" is a weekly e-newsletter, with news, trends and formulations via e-mail.\n\n\"Cosmetics & Toiletries Bench Reference\" is a directory of cosmetic ingredients and sources for raw materials.\n"}

These digital networks are supported by enterprise class technology platforms that have been leveraged within an organization to support critical business functions and services. Some examples of these technology platforms are Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Supply Chain Management (SCM), Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Knowledge Management System (KMS), Enterprise Content Management (ECM), and Warehouse Management System (WMS) among others. The purpose of these technology platforms is to digitally enable seamless integration and information exchange within the organization to employees and outside the organization to customers, suppliers, and other business partners.\n\nThe term \"Digital Firm\" originated, as a concept in a series of Management Information Systems (MIS) books authored by Kenneth C. Laudon and it provides a new way to describe organizations that operate differently than the traditional brick and mortar business as a result of broad sweeping changes in technology and global markets. Digital firms place an emphasis on the digitization of business processes and services through sophisticated technology and information systems. These information systems create opportunities for digital firms to decentralize operations, accelerate market readiness and responsiveness, enhance customer interactions, as well as increase efficiencies across a variety of business functions.\n\nTechnology adoption has been increasing as digital firms continually look to achieve greater levels cost savings, competitive advantage, and operational performance optimization. As organizations adopt technology, the internal appetite for additional technologies increases and in some cases accelerates. This acceleration of technology adoption by digital firms creates a \"digital divide\" as emerging technology is absorbed at varying rates across organizations. This technology divergence can affect competitive dynamics in the market place between firms that achieve operational benefits from the technology and firms which have yet to adapt.\n\nWhile the growth of new technology consumption is not uniform across organizations, the trend for business-driven investment in technology across all markets has and continues to increase. During the span of 1990 to 2006, the gross U.S. domestic investment in information and communications technology, as measured by the U.S. Census Bureau, increased by 170%.\n\nThe market for Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems and other packaged applications started to grow substantially during the 90's to the point that the ERP market alone accounts for approximately $25 billion. According to surveys conducted in 2002, nearly \"75% of global Fortune 1000 firms had implemented SAP’s ERP suite\".\n\nThrough digital networks and information systems, the digital firm is able to operate core business services and functions continuously and more efficiently. This digital enablement of business processes creates highly dynamic information systems allowing for more efficient and productive management of an organization.\n\nAdditionally, digital enablement of core business functions and services provides an organization with opportunities to:\n\n\nTechnology and information systems serve many critical roles in a digital firm by providing technology-driven capabilities that increase operational performance. For example, digital networks and information systems allow organizations to connect and integrate supply chains in ways that are real-time, uninterrupted and highly responsive to market conditions.\n\nAnother example of an information system that can increase an organization's performance awareness and management capabilities is a Real-Time Business Intelligence (RTBI) system. A RTBI system can provide a highly responsive and strategic decision support platform for an organization to analyze operational events as they occur. RTBI systems often work closely with Organizational Risk Management (ORM) systems in this capacity to increase capabilities around monitoring operational performance and assessing operational risks. These types of information systems can increase an organization's capabilities to effectively manage performance and productivity.\n\nThe three main enterprise information systems that can positively affect an organization's performance and productivity are:\n\nERP deployments can be complex and require a significant shift in business operations for an organization but the benefits can be substantial.\n\nAfter implementation of an ERP system within an organization there are measurable performance and productivity gains that can be directly correlated to the ERP system go-live event. This study conducted a detailed analysis of the ERP data produced and found that there was a direct causal relationship between ERP systems and performance gains in an organization.\n\nOrganizations that deploy ERP systems typically, based on performance and productivity gains, also implement both of the following enterprise platforms as well.\n\nOrganizations leverage CRM systems to improve the overall management of their relationships with customers. CRM systems operate as enterprise platforms that provide digital firms with opportunities to closely manage all aspects of interactions with customers through customer-oriented business processes.\n\nOrganizations which implement CRM systems may encounter some lag time until the CRM productivity affects are fully realized in the firm based on studies. However, the lag effects are difficult to measure and based in part on the organization's ability to leverage the new CRM system and adapt to the changes in business operations as a result.\n\nStudies of organizations that implemented SCM systems to improve supply chain management capabilities found that those systems had a significant impact on productivity and performance within the organization. Additionally, the implementation of SCM and CRM systems differed from an ERP implementation in that organizational performance could be directly correlated \"with both the initial purchase and go-live event\".\n\nSCM and CRM systems are often viewed as \"extended enterprise systems\" due to the way that they integrate with ERP systems and the benefits that they bring to organizations.\n\n"}

{"id": "4994998", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4994998", "title": "Free (ISP)", "text": "Free (ISP)\n\nFree is a French telecommunications company, subsidiary of Iliad that provides voice, video, data, and Internet telecommunications to consumers in France. Its head office is in the 8th arrondissement of Paris.\n\nFree provides ISP services in France and in the 30 OECD countries. It was the first company to offer a \"triple play\" service in France through its self-produced singular Freebox set-top box, claiming to have invented the \"box\" marketing concept in France in reference to all the other French ISPs who thereafter released \"triple play\" modems named to include the anglicism \"box\" as a suffix. These \"boxes\" provide comprehensive telecommunication services such as high-speed internet, telephone and digital television packages, leading Free to become the world's number one IPTV provider offering almost systematically IPTV to subscribers and optimising it to be available on most landlines.\n\nDeveloping its own 3G and 4G networks, Free Mobile was launched in 2012 and became the 4th mobile network operator in France.\n\nFree was the third ISP in France to offer Internet access without a subscription or a surcharged phone number, on 26 April 1999. Unlike its predecessors in the niche of access without subscription (World Online on 1999-04-01 and on 1999-04-19), Free's offer was not restricted in time or number of subscribers.\n\nIn 2002, Free was the first ISP to provide a V.92 connection.\n\nSince September 2002, Free contributed significantly to French ADSL boom. The offer was able to launch as soon as the incumbent was forced to stop abuse of dominant position and to apply fair wholesale prices.\n\nUnbundling, in France, refers to the obligation for the incumbent carrier France Telecom to lease the Local loop, because it is a natural monopoly. Although the unbundling process was intended to start by 2000, the actual unbundling process actually started at the end of 2002, after a long conflict between the French regulation authority ARCEP and the non-cooperative incumbent.\n\nFree has to pay a rental fee of €9 per month and per subscriber to the incumbent for the Twisted pair of Copper between the area central office and the subscriber premises. Although more expensive than the real cost of €7.63, this solution is still far more profitable than the bundled option.\n\nSince January 2003, a \"Freenaut\" has maintained an unofficial website showing figures and graphics about Free unbundled network deployment (Free Unbundling). Another \"Freenaut\" website has provided network status monitoring maps Unbundling status and location since the end of 2003. These initiatives are made possible thanks to the transparency of Free's network: their equipment replies to ping and has a meaningful reverse DNS.\n\nOn 11 November 2006, Free announced the deployment of a new fiber to the home (FTTH) network for its subscribers. The initial plan's goal is to cover Paris as well as some towns in the Paris suburbs and selected neighborhoods in other French cities by 2012. By December 2007, the work was 30% finished, and the remaining work was progressing \"at a furious pace\".\n\nOn 31 August 2007, Free updated the offer with more details. Download bandwidth shall be 100 Mbit/s and TV services shall be available for two televisions, at the same price of €29.99/month.\n\nFree has developed its own fiber network technology, called Iliad P2P, based on Ethernet in the First Mile and having a point to point (P2P) topology. High curvature optic fibers are manufactured by the Dutch company Draka.\n\nThe deployment is still essentially in the horizontal phase (the vertical phase being connection to the subscriber premises), and large-scale deployment to customers is foreseen. On 26 June 2008, and the mayor inaugurated Free's FTTH network in a district of Montpellier.\n\nOn March 2008, Iliad made the commitment to cover Paris at 75% by the second half of 2009, and reiterated its goal to connect 4 million French homes to its own FTTH network by 2012. Significant volumes of subscribers will be connected as soon as the legislative framework is in place, expected by ARCEP for autumn 2009.\n\nThe Voiceband Dial-up internet access offer counts for a very small number of subscribers currently, as 98% of French homes were eligible for ADSL in 2006.\n\nFree began its activities with the famous free-of-charge Internet access, although data phone calls fees are not included. Another offer combines an Internet access with 50 hours of data phone calls for 14.94 euros per month.\n\nInitially, Freebox was the name of the Freebox device, which consists of the Set-top box and Modem. Because of the device's popularity and reputation, it eventually became the name of the offer.\n\n\n\nAccording to a study published by Google at the RIPE meeting in October 2008, Free is probably the largest native IPv6 ISP in the World. By end 2008, almost all French IPv6 traffic measured in the study comes from Free customers.\n\nFree deployed the IPv6 infrastructure in only 5 weeks, from 7 November to 11 December 2007, thanks to an innovative 6rd (IPv6 rapid deployment) proposal by Rémi Després.\n\n\nIn May 2009 Free reconfigured the set-top boxes to act as Wifi hotspots by default. With over 3 million hotspots, it is thought to be the largest Wifi hotspot network in the world during that time. They require authentication which makes them only accessible to Free's ADSL and now mobile customers. Their main use is thus to let customers away from home continue accessing the Internet using the ADSL connection of other Free customer within Wifi range. For security reasons this access is isolated from the ADSL user's normal Wifi network, and is given lower priority.\n\n\nIn 2003, Free introduced unlimited phone calls at no additional price, while other phone operators or ISPs charged per-minute fees for telephone calls. Competitors have then been forced to imitate these changes, but with fewer destinations included or at an additional price. Bundled Free subscribers enjoy same free calls as those unbundled since March 2004. Calls to United States and Canada have been free of charge since December 2005.\n\nIn 2006, Free and France Telecom were in conflict against an unfair increase of Neuf Cegetel own termination tariff, aimed at undermining unlimited phone offers in France. The French regulator ARCEP then decided to apply a threshold for call termination. Unlimited free phone calls have been perennial in France since then.\n\nA wide range of telephone services are provided at no additional cost, such as an online answering machine, ringback tone customization, call transfer, caller ID, inbound and outbound call filtering, conference calls, and Wi-Fi voice SIP.\n\nSince April 2007, each customer has been assigned a fax number in addition to the traditional phone number. This additional line is dedicated to the online faxing service.\n\nAccording to a study published in 2008 by Light Reading, Free is \"by far\" the largest IPTV carrier in the World. This fact is also confirmed by the TV Markets Quarterly Monitoring.\n\nAccess rights of television channels are applied securely without requiring any smartcard, thanks to the ARDP protocol created by Free and submitted to the community through the IETF.\n\nThe sole property of Free, the Freebox device is loaned to the customer for the duration of the ADSL contract. More than a simple ADSL modem, it is the primary conduit through which Free provides many of its services. It also replaces many devices that customers may otherwise have to purchase and thus provides added value of its own. Customers wishing to use newer models — such as the Freebox Revolution — must pay an extra fee.\n\nThe latest revision is actually composed of two parts:\n\n\nSince August 2008, the parent company Iliad (including Free and Alice brands) is the second-largest ISP in France. The leader is Orange (former state monopoly company France Telecom), and the third is SFR.\n\nIn 2007 (a major consolidation year in the French broadband market), Free was the only ISP brand to gain market share.\n\nFree was the second-largest French ISP until end June 2007, when competitor Neuf Cegetel acquired (T-Online France). Neuf Cegetel used to grow essentially by purchasing its competitors, until it was itself absorbed by SFR. Until 2009, Free has always had a higher organic growth than Neuf Cegetel and SFR.\n\nIliad regained its second place after buying \"Alice Telecom\" from Telecom Italia in the summer of 2008.\n\nUntil the purchase of Alice France, Free's subscribers growth was exclusively organic, except for the strategic acquisition of the FTTH ISP in 2006 (about 500 subscribers).\n\n\nFree claims to be the first profitable ISP in France and to have the lowest subscriber acquisition cost amongst French operators.\n\nThe unbundling ratio is one of the key strategic figures:\n\nBecause of bandwidth cost, only a subset of the TV services is offered to bundled subscribers; while unbundled subscribers can access value-added services such as VOD and Subscription VOD. These services' revenues are constantly increasing.\n\nIn 2007, Free had the greatest EBITDA margin of the sector in Europe, was the only actor to gain market share in France and had a debt ratio 10 times lower than the industry average. Thanks to these assets, the initial FTTH deployment (targeted at 2012) will be entirely self-financed by existing activities.\n\nAlthough investors are concerned about the investments in both the 3G mobile network and an FTTH network (1 billion euros each), the perspectives of Free and of the whole sector in Europe are promising according to analysts.\n\nFree is the last independent operator in France. Google, in the first years of its existence, was sometimes suggested as a comparison for the Free spirit. Unlike all other French broadband ISPs, nearly everything is designed within the company: Freebox devices, DSLAMs, network switches and the backend billing system. The company has a medium- and long-term industrial strategy rather than the short-term financial strategy of its competitors.\n\nFree is often designated by journalists as the \"broadband maverick\", the \"troublemaker of the Internet\", a \"do-it-yourselfer\", a \"pioneer in IPTV\", a \"truly disruptive company\", the \"geek's ISP\", the \"cactus of the telecoms\", the \"Broadband Rebel\", \"one of the greatest French industrial successes of the last twenty years\", a \"Silicon Valley success story\", a \"Robin Hood\", an \"Uncle Scrooge\", a \"nightmare vision for Orange, SFR and Bouygues\".\n\nThe ISP, as well as its owner Xavier Niel, promote free and independent media, such as:\n\nCorporate culture appears obvious from these remarkable facts:\n\n\"Freenaut\" is the common designation for each internaut using the Internet through a Free connection. This community is estimated to reach between 10 and 12 million individuals as of March 2009. The \"Freenaut\" community includes a core group of technology enthusiasts who contribute to Free's influence and popularity in several ways:\n\nAccording to recurrent audience measurement reports conducted by Médiamétrie, Free's general portal is the fourth most popular website in France. During peak load hours, Free accounts for nearly half the traffic on the Amsterdam Internet Exchange.\n\nOn 3 January 2013 at 4pm in France, Free released a new firmware for its latest modem named \"Revolution\" which contained an advertisement blocker. The firmware of the modems was updated when rebooting, and the Ad filtering was enabled by default. Within a few hours, Free gained media attention and was strongly criticized by website editors for penalizing them instead of Free's target Google. On 7 January at 8.30am, the Ad filtering was removed before Free ultimately decided, on 17 January at 6pm, to include the Ad filter and disable it by default. However, customers who restarted their modem between the 3rd and 7 January had enabled the option without even knowing it.\n\nSince Free is one of the biggest ISP in France, worries started to raise of French hosting forums concerning the people's interest into Ad blockers in general.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Empresas Fonalledas Inc., also has holdings in dairy cattle operations, milk processing plants, non-dairy food industries, plastics manufacturing, real estate ventures, and banking operations. Employing more than 9,000 people in total, Empresas Fonalledas companies include Plaza del Caribe, Tres Monjitas, Vaqueria Tres Monjitas, Ganaderia Tres Monjitas and franchise Soft & Creamy.\n\nFonalledas was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico into one of the island's wealthiest families. There he received his early education at Catholic schools in Hato Rey and Rio Piedras. In 1966, he graduated \"magna cum laude\" from the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico and earned a degree in Economics. Fonalledas pursued his law degree at the University of Puerto Rico and was admitted to the Puerto Rico Bar in 1971. He joined his family's business enterprises \"Empresas Fonalledas\", a business which has its origins in the early part of the 20th century.\n\nFonalledas' grandfather Jaime Fonalledas Garriga had a farm called \"Santa Elena\", located in the town of Toa Baja. There he had a small store and sold milk and dairy products from his farm. On July 21, 1918, Fonalledas Garriga together with his two brothers Jerónimo and Gerardo and his sister Rosa bought 527 acres (2 square kilometers) of land in Hato Rey, a section of San Juan, which was part of a farm called \"Las Monjas\" and where sugar cane was cultivated.\n\nThe family began their milk and dairy producing operations and named their enterprise \"Vaqueria Tres Monjitas\". The quality of their product made them leaders in their agricultural field. What began as a small business has evolved into Empresas Fonalledas, one of Puerto Rico's largest business enterprises which include Plaza Del Caribe in Ponce, Puerto Rico; as well as Vaqueria Tres Monjitas which produces milk, dairy products, juice drinks; an ice cream companies, several real estate developments and Plaza Las Americas.\n\nFonalledas was still a child in the late 1950s when the family thought of the idea of developing a shopping center, modeled after Lenox Square in Atlanta and spurred on by the evolution of the concept in the United States. Construction began on the same sugar cane fields on which the Fonalledas family had established their dairy business and Plaza Las Americas was inaugurated in 1968, boasting the first JC Penney store outside the continental United States.\n\nFonalledas eventually rose to the presidency of the family business. Under his leadership Plaza Las Americas has become the largest shopping center in the Caribbean. The center has often been used as a testing ground for U.S. retailers looking to expand internationally. Macy’s opened their first store outside the continental United States, Border’s Books & Music opened its first bilingual store and a 13-screen movie theater was opened for a total of 21 movie screens. The sales figures place Plaza Las Americas among the top 1% of super-regional shopping centers in North America.\n\nUnder Fonalledas' leadership Vaqueria Tres Monjitas has become the largest milk and dairy industry in Puerto Rico. The company, with over 450 employees and annual sales of $110 million (U.S.), relocated its operations to an area in the town of Dorado, into a modern plant that boasts a modern quality control laboratory. The company, which also produces fruit juices and drinks, has three warehouse and distribution centers located in the cities of Ponce, Arecibo and Mayagüez.\n\nEmpresas Fonalledas invested millions of dollars in various real estate projects. The construction of an office tower, Torre Chardon, began in 1998 and was finished in 2001. Fonalledas also oversaw the development of two residential projects in San Juan and Ponce respectively as part of the real estate holdings of Empresas Fonalledas.\n\nThe San Juan project includes two residential buildings with 58 apartments located in Hato Rey and the Ponce residential project features 132 walk-up units with direct access to Plaza Del Caribe.\n\nIn 2000, Fonalledas was named \"Puerto Rico Chamber of Commerce Businessman of the Year\". He has also been recognized as one of the Caribbean Business Top Business Leaders of Puerto Rico. In 2003, Fonalledas donated 500 thousand dollars to the scholarship funds of the University of Puerto Rico.\n\nFonalledas, who has been honored by universities, professional associations, and the Roman Catholic Church is married to the former Zoraida Ferraiuoli-Martinez, the Republican National Committeewoman for Puerto Rico, who was a Superdelegate to the 2000 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. Mrs. Fonalledas received her Juris Doctor Degree from the InterAmerican University School of Law of Puerto Rico and her LLM in Labor Law from the New York University School of Law.

{"id": "659309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=659309", "title": "Laurance Rockefeller", "text": "Laurance Rockefeller\n\nLaurance Spelman Rockefeller (May 26, 1910 – July 11, 2004) was an American philanthropist, businessman, financier, and major conservationist. He was a prominent third-generation member of the Rockefeller family, being the fourth child of John Davison Rockefeller Jr. and Abigail Greene \"Abby\" Aldrich. His siblings were Abby, John III, Nelson, Winthrop, and David.\n\nRockefeller was born in New York City. He graduated from Princeton University (1932) and attended Harvard Law School for two years, until he decided he did not want to be a lawyer.\n\nOn August 22, 1934, in Woodstock, Vermont, Laurance married childhood friend Mary French, whose mother, Mary Montague Billings French, was a friend of Laurance's mother. When brother Nelson attended Dartmouth College, he shared a room with Mary's brother. Mary was granddaughter of Frederick H. Billings, a president of Northern Pacific Railway.\n\nLaurance and Mary had three daughters and a son. They are Laura Rockefeller Chasin, Marion Rockefeller Weber, Dr. Lucy R. Waletzky, and Larry Rockefeller. He had eight grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.\n\nIn 1937, he inherited his grandfather's seat on the New York Stock Exchange. He served as founding trustee of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund for forty-two years, from its inception in 1940 to 1982; during this time he also served as president (1958–68) and later its chairman (1968–80) for twenty-two years, longer than any other leader in the Fund's history. He was also a founding trustee of the Rockefeller Family Fund from 1967 to 1977.\n\nHe was a leading figure in the pioneering field of venture capital, which began as a joint partnership with all five brothers and their only sister, Babs, in 1946. In 1969 this became the successful Venrock Associates, which provided important early funding for Intel and Apple Computer, amongst many other start-up technology companies, including many other firms involved in healthcare. Over the years his investment interests ranged also into the fields of aerospace, electronics, high temperature physics, composite materials, optics, lasers, data processing, thermionics, instrumentation and nuclear power.\n\nVenrock was a limited partnership investment company financed by members of the Rockefeller family and a number of the institutions with which the family had longstanding philanthropic ties, among them the Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller University, and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.\n\nRockefeller's major interest was in aviation; after the War, he became friendly with Captain Eddie Rickenbacker, who had triumphed in many dogfights over Europe. Rockefeller had learned to fly, and found Rickenbacker's vivid accounts of an approaching boom in commercial air travel to be persuasive. Within a decade after Rockefeller's considerable investment, Eastern Airlines had become the most profitable airline to emerge after World War II. He became its largest shareholder. He also funded the pivotal post-WWII military contractor McDonnell Aircraft Corp.\n\nRockefeller was a longtime friend and associate of DeWitt Wallace, who with his wife in 1922 co-founded \"Reader's Digest\". Wallace, who was a major funder of the family's Colonial Williamsburg, appointed Laurance as an outside director in the company. He wanted to ensure that it preserved its patriotic mission of informing and educating the public, along with support for national parks, one of Rockefeller's primary interests.\n\nThrough his resort management company, Rockresorts, Inc., Rockefeller opened environmentally focused hotels at Caneel Bay on Saint John, United States Virgin Islands (1956; a favorite resort today for celebrities), some property of which was later turned over to the Virgin Islands National Park; in Puerto Rico, on Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands, and Hawaii, contributing to the movement now known as eco-tourism. The last of these, the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel, was established in 1965 on the Kohala Coast of the island of Hawaii. Its most noted general manager was Adi Kohler, who later wrote the story of the construction of the famous hotel in his book \"Mr. Mauna Kea\" published by McKenna Publishing Group. While sailing past Virgin Gorda, Rockefeller spotted an idyllic half-mile crescent bay with what he dubbed \"wilderness beach\". In 1958 planning and land acquisition began for what would become Little Dix Bay. The resort opened in 1964 and on January 18, 2014 Little Dix Bay celebrated its 50th anniversary. In 1993, the resort became part of Rosewood Hotels & Resorts but remains true to Rockefeller's vision of natural harmony and balance while offering an escape from the ordinary.\n\nRockefeller funded the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center at a critical juncture of its early development. He also funded William Irwin Thompson's Lindisfarne Association, a think tank and retreat. He had a major involvement in the New York Zoological Society, along with support from other family members and philanthropies; he was a long-time trustee (1935–86), president (1968–71) and chairman (1971–85).\n\nIn 1983, Laurance Rockefeller donated the primary funds to create The Mirror Theater Ltd, a New York-based theater company founded by Sabra Jones. The Mirror Theater Ltd is known for producing the 1983 Broadway play \"Alice in Wonderland\" at the Virginia Theatre and for the many plays performed by its Mirror Repertory Company.\n\nRockefeller also funded controversial research of the PEAR lab, dealing with consciousness-based physical phenomena.\n\nIn later life, Rockefeller became interested in UFOs. In 1993, along with his niece, Anne Bartley, the stepdaughter of Winthrop Rockefeller and the then-president of the \"Rockefeller Family Fund\", he established the \"UFO Disclosure Initiative to the Clinton White House\". They asked for all UFO information held by the government, including from the CIA and the US Air Force, to be declassified and released to the public. The first and most important test case where declassification had to apply, according to Rockefeller, was the Roswell UFO incident. In September 1994, the Air Force categorically denied the incident was UFO-related. Rockefeller briefed Clinton on the results of his initiative in 1995. Clinton did produce an Executive Order in late 1994 to declassify numerous documents in the National Archives, but this did not specifically refer to UFO-related files.\n\nHe also had an interest, gained via his mother Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, in Buddhism and Asian cultural affairs. He funded the research of Harvard Medical School Professor Dr. John E. Mack, author of \"Passport to the Cosmos\". He also was reported to have supported the work of Dr. Steven M. Greer of the Disclosure Project. However this has only been substantiated by Greer himself with no evidence other than his word.\n\nHe was noted for his involvement in conservation (Lady Bird Johnson in 1967 labeled him \"America's leading conservationist\") and the protection of wildlife and was chairman of the \"Outdoor Recreation Resources Review Commission\". He was also a recipient of the Lady Bird Johnson Conservation Award. He served on dozens of federal, state and local commissions and advised every president since Dwight D. Eisenhower on issues involving recreation, wilderness preservation and ecology. He founded the American Conservation Association and supported many other environmental groups.\n\nHe funded the expansion of Grand Teton National Park and was instrumental in establishing and enlarging national parks in Wyoming, California, the Virgin Islands, Vermont, Maine and Hawaii. In his home state, New York, he expended further cash and influence to help establish parklands and urban open spaces. There, as an active member of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, he helped create a chain of parks that blocked the advance of urban sprawl.\n\nIn September 1991, he was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for contributions to conservation and historic preservation. Awarded by President George H. W. Bush, it was the first time in the Medal's history (since 1777) that it had been awarded for outdoor issues, effectively naming Rockefeller as \"Mr Conservation\", who more than any other American had put this issue on the public agenda. Rockefeller said at the award presentation that nothing was more important to him than \"the creation of a conservation ethic in America\".\n\nIn 1992 Rockefeller and his wife Mary donated their Woodstock, Vermont summer home and farm to the National Park Service, creating a national park dedicated to the history of conservation, now called the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park. In 2001, Rockefeller transferred ownership of his landmark 1106-acre (4.5 km²) \"JY Ranch\" to the Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. It was accepted by Vice President Dick Cheney on behalf of the Federal government (see External Links below). Mary Rockefeller died in 1997, at the age of 86.\n\nFollowing his wife Mary's death, Rockefeller returned to New York. He died in his sleep of natural cause by pulmonary fibrosis on July 11, 2004 at the age of 94. Laurance Rockefeller was survived by daughters Lucy, Marion, Laura, and one son Larry Rockefeller. He was interred next to his wife at the Rockefeller Family Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow.\n\nPartial list of his more notable memberships:\n(Source: Robin Winks, \"Laurance S.

The podcast describes itself as \"honest and uncensored\" and emphasizes a relatable, informal tone. Matt Giovanisci served as co-host until 2015, when he was replaced by Thomas Frank. Since the podcast's debut, the brand has expanded to include a community forum, book club, and a 2014 book, \"Mastering Mint\". \n\n\"Listen Money Matters\" was founded in December 2012 by Andrew Fiebert. Fiebert had been displaced by Hurricane Sandy and was reconsidering his personal finances, and future co-host Matt Giovanisci, who at the time was heavily in debt, had turned to Fiebert for financial advice. Giovanisci says that he and Fiebert sought to create a podcast that \"wasn’t just two boring white dudes on the Internet spouting off about how they should be investing in Vanguard mutual funds... The idea was to be fun, joke, curse, drink, and just be real people who happen to be sneaking in some personal finance information\". \n\n\"Business Insider\" named \"Listen Money Matters\" one of their \"11 podcasts to listen to if you want to get rich\", writing that \"This lively show... will keep you alert and laughing. The hosts offer actionable personal finance advice, and deliver it in a very raw and honest tone.\" \"Forbes\" has described the podcast as a \"hit\" that \"has millennials all over America listening\". In 2015, Instavest named Listen Money Matters as one of the \"Six Best Personal Finance Podcasters on the Internet\".\n\nIn 2014, Fiebert and Giovanisci released a book, \"Mastering Mint\", advising investors on how to manage their finances with the service Mint.com. In May 2015, Listen Money Matters produced a rap video about personal finance titled \"All My Money\". \"Quartz\" wrote of the video that \"it’s rare to come across something [in financial discussions] as fun—and actually educational—as this rap video\".\n\nAndrew Fiebert took a job as a data engineer at an investment bank following college. After Hurricane Sandy struck the Eastern United States in October 2012, he was forced to move back in with his parents. The experience caused him to reconsider his finances, and his wife suggested that he put his thoughts into a podcast. He describes himself as \"Listen Money Matters\"' \"Chief Nerd\". \n\nMatt Giovanisci left the podcast in 2015 to concentrate on his Swim University brand, which produces a podcast and other material on pool and hot tub maintenance. He was replaced on the podcast by Thomas Frank of College Info Geek. \n\nOn the podcast's July 23, 2018 episode, Frank announced that he would be stepping down and that Giovanisci would return as co-host.\n\n"}

Sadek became a Director of Burns Sadek Research and founded Sadek Wynberg Research that was sold to WPP as Sadek Wynberg Millward Brown and later Director at Research International. He created the Inish Turk Beg brand, based on the values of the eponymous island, Inish Turk Beg. He sold the island in 2013, while keeping the intellectual property rights to the brand and businesses he established. He is a CEO at brand management consultancy, TransgressiveX, based in London, which specialises in developing business value through brands, particularly employing a contemporary iteration of Social Exchange Theory. He is also Chairman of Tryangle, a training and facilitation social-enterprise and has various interests in sports, music and charities.\n\nSadek attended St Columba's College in Dublin from 1975–1980, before reading Mental & Moral Science for one year, then 4 years of Pure Psychology, at Trinity College, Dublin, from 1980-1985, from where he graduated with a BA in Moderatorship.\n\nA career in market research began in 1985 at Lansdowne Market Research in Dublin, before he moved to London with his friend, Brian Pullman, remarking at the time that they were “like generations of other Irish emigrants, catching the boat to the mainland” to seek their fortune. Sadek became a Director of Burns Research Partners, renamed Burns Sadek Research two years later, a boutique qualitative research firm. After 7 years there, Mr Sadek founded Sadek Wynberg Research in Kensington in 1993, with Rebecca Wynberg. SWR conducted research for the development of brands and communications for many of the world's blue-chip companies, including Unilever, Bacardi Global Brands, Kimberly-Clark, Vodafone and Sony Ericsson. The firm grew to be the largest of its kind in the UK by 2000 and the world by 2003, whereupon it was sold to WPP, becoming Sadek Wynberg Millward Brown \n\nSadek became Global Leader of Millward Brown's Qualitative Network for the next three years bringing together many of the acquisitions made by the group into a coherent network offering common standards across a wide geography, before taking up the role of Worldwide Commercial & Strategy Director at Research International, a company operating in 52 countries. n this position, his responsibility was to make the organisation more efficient, and renew its intellectual capital base with innovation and renovation of existing and new services.\n\nTalking of ‘practising what I preach’ he then 'became a client' and created the Inish Turk Beg brand, based on the values of the eponymous island, Inish Turk Beg, off the coast of Ireland which he had purchased in 2003. The island was a 63-acre sheep grazing piece of land when acquired, and 10 years later, Sadek had installed an all-weather access system on the island (and an associated mainland farm he bought to have a 'foul-weather base' and Connemara Pony Stud), a sewage system, roads, 5 homes, a Boatyard, fuel storage facilities, and numerous agricultural buildings. Fields were reconfigured with drainage and new planting. 10,000 trees were planted to reassert the traditionally wooded nature of the island. In addition, the island was connected by under-ocean electricity and water supplies, but investments were made in extensive solar-panel power and the burying of all utilities. The Inish Turk Beg brand spoke of ‘living life at a tilt’ and encompassed a luxury rental destination, a Connemara Pony Stud, a smoked fish line distributed throughout Ireland and the UK, Art Residencies and Exhibitions, a number-one listed music album ‘The Brilliant Irish Flute’, and ‘Maiden Voyage’ a single-malt Irish Whiskey, which has gone on to win industry awards. In 2013, a further whiskey bottling was made 'Chief Islander's Choice' to celebrate Celtic Whiskey Shop's 10 Anniversary. The brand also won a 'Mobius' for best new brand, selected from almost 5,000 entries from 36 countries, in 2010. \n\nThe company that owned Inish Turk Beg went into receivership in 2012 and the island was put up for sale. Mr Sadek retains all the assets of the island, including the Intellectual Property Rights to the Inish Turk Beg brand. The whiskey business continues to be active. In a statement to the \"Irish Independent\" on 11 February 2013, Mr Sadek said: \"Having travelled the world, I am certain that Inish Turk Beg is one of the most beautiful places on earth. It inspires, intoxicates, enlivens. Those who come after me benefit from a decade of loving investment, building and imagining. They will not be able to repeat that, for the place is now transformed, but they can love it as I have done. I wish them well. The island and the sea have taught me many things, among which is that some journeys are orbital and you never know when you might end up back where you started again.\"\n\nSadek is Chairman of Tryangle, a training and facilitation social-enterprise, whose purpose is to improve the lives of its clients by enabling them to have better job prospects, life coping skills and opportunities for constructive socialisation through sport. \n\nHis principal activity is as CEO at brand management consultancy, TransgressiveX, based in London, which specialises in developing business value through brands, particularly employing a contemporary iteration of Social Exchange Theory. TransgressiveX was appointed globally on Unilever's business in 2015. Further successes with clients such as KCF and the launch of an innovative quantitative research framework for brands resulted in TransgressiveX being nominated as one of 2016's top disruptive marketing brands.\n\nMr Sadek's increasing breadth of activity led to him featuring on the launch series of \"The Secret Millionaire\" in Ireland, screened by RTÉ (October 2011), and Channel 4, followed up by a ‘Look-back’ episode screened by RTÉ (October 2012), \n\nHe is also Executive Producer at Boss Bikes Club, a review channel focused on the world of motorcycling.\n\nFurther involvement in the music industry came as co-manager of Shaefri, his daughter who launched her debut EP \"Venture\" in December 2011 and went on to be awarded Best New Singer-Songwriter, 2012 by the Irish Entertainment Awards, and tipped as ‘number one new act to follow’ in Hot Press's ‘Hot for 2012’ listing.\n\nIn November, 2013 Mr Sadek presented a TEDx Talk in Teddington, London, featuring his views on how interactions in life can be understood through an analysis of what he calls 'eXchange', powered by the notions of seduction and persuasion.\n\nOn RTÉ Radio 1's \"The Business Programme\", during September 2014, presenter Richard Curran interviewed Mr Sadek about his career, stretching from Lansdowne Market Research in Dublin, and in London to Burns Research Partners, Sadek Wynberg Research, Millward Brown, Research International, WPP, Inish Turk Beg and TransgressiveX. During the interview, it was clear that global banking strategy, including a turn away from Euro-denominated assets in \"delinquent markets\" such as Ireland, had caused the interruption of the Inish Turk Beg brand. Meanwhile, \"necessity is the mother of invention\" was proven by the creation and commercial success of TransgressiveX, which was now operating globally.\n\nMr Sadek also writes occasional features, such as on the topic of Brexit.\n\nSadek was born to an Egyptian father (Fernando Habib Sadek 1928-2005) who worked as an epidemiologist with the World Health Organisation and Irish mother (Marie Celine Meehan from Limerick city, born 1927) who worked as a nurse then teacher. Sadek was educated and lived around the world in Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Malaysia, Indonesia, Barbados, Antigua and Ireland.

He served as superintendent in 1873 and then President of the Company in 1877, overseeing all workings in the factory. He was credited with managing to resolve the most notable worker strike in the town's history that lasted for almost two months in 1889. Before his death, Oakes Angier had helped manage a highly prosperous family business and commissioned buildings for the betterment of the town of Easton (including a schoolhouse in North Easton). He served as President of the North Easton Savings Bank and Vice-President of the Easton National Bank, was a Director of the Lincoln National Bank of Boston and the Kingsley Iron Machine Company, trustee of the State Lunatic Asylum in Taunton, MA (Taunton State Hospital), Director of the American Loan and Trust Company and of the United Electric Securities Company, and co-owned a sugar plantation in Louisiana.\n\nOakes Angier Ames was the oldest son of Massachusetts Congressman Oakes Ames (1804-1873) (a major force behind the Union Pacific Railroad) and brother of Oliver Ames (governor) (1831-1895), 35th Governor of Massachusetts from 1887-1890, Frank Morton Ames, Henry Gilmore Ames and Susan Eveline (Ames) French. His mother, Evelina Orville Gilmore, was the daughter of Joshua and Hannah (Lothrop) Gilmore of Easton, MA. The Ames family lineage from which he was descended can be traced back to William Ames who emigrated with his brother John to New England in 1635 and settled in Bridgewater, MA. His great-grandfather Capt. John Ames and grandfather Oliver Ames Sr. founded the Ames Shovel Works during a time when shovels were needed to build canals and railroads. The Ames family was among the wealthiest in Massachusetts.\n\nOakes Angier attended public school in Easton, MA. He then attended Fruit Hill Academy in RI and the Leicester Academy, MA. and entered the family business at the age of eighteen. He learned how shovels were made and became skilled in handling the affairs of the workers.\n\nThe Oliver Ames and Sons Company of Oakes Angiers’ grandfather Oliver Ames Sr. (known as Old Oliver) was originally located across from Shovelshop Pond in Easton, MA. On March 2, 1852, Oakes Angier witnessed the great fire that destroyed all buildings and subsequently became ill due to smoke inhalation while trying in vain to stop the destruction. It was believed at the time that he had contracted Consumption and was sent to Cuba to help his lungs heal. On December 28, 1852, Evelina Ames received word from her son that he had arrived in Cuba after departing from Charleston, S.C. six days prior. When he returned he was in much better health.\n\nThe watchman at the time of the fire was a man by the name of Patric Quinn. Quinn, during his nightly round, accidentally dropped a lantern into highly flammable varnish. The finishing shop burst into flames and quickly caught fire to the rest of the buildings. At the time, the Ames family was considering moving the shovel making operation to another location entirely and so there was a silver lining to this devastating event. It is suggested that the fire made such a lasting impression on Oakes Angier that he was the first family member to build his home, Queset House, out of stone. The new shovel factory was also built out of stone, as were many future Ames structures.\n\nIt was often customary at the time for previous generations to live with their sons and daughters. Oakes Angier lived into his mid-twenties with his father Oakes and his mother Evelina in the house originally built by his grandfather Old Oliver. Old Oliver continued to live in a section of the house with his son and daughter-in-law until his own death. Their house was located on Main Street across from the company shops and is no longer standing. When the Queset House was finished, Oakes brought his new bride, Catherine (Hobart) Ames to live there and raise a family.\n\nIn 1863, Oakes’ Angiers grandfather, Oliver Ames Sr. (1779-1863), passed away leaving the Oliver Ames and Sons Company and all private property to the remaining Ames family members of Easton, MA. To his three grandsons, Oakes Angier, Oliver and Frederick Lothrop Ames, he bequeathed one-third of the Company interest divided equally, thus making them partners. His other grandson, Frank Morton Ames, became prosperous in his own right as President of the Kingsley Iron and Machine Company of Canton, MA. In the midst of the Civil War, the three grandsons of Oliver Ames worked together to maintain and expand the already thriving family business. Oliver became involved in business ventures relating to the Company outside of Easton, MA. Frederick was treasurer and secretary. Oakes Angier was supervisor, general manager, and then President from 1877 until his death. By that time the Company was producing approximately 117,500 dozen shovels per year, with 500 men working 10hr work days.\n\nWhile supervisor, he obtained an antrim patent in 1863 for his welding furnace designed to balance the temperatures needed to weld a shovel blade and the strap.\n\nIn 1873, he and his brother Frank Morton Ames purchased what would become the Southside and Estelle Plantations in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana for $180,000.The plantations were known at the time to be quite cutting edge in the methods of harvesting sugar and transporting the finished product. 60,000 to 70,000 pounds of sugar were produced a day. His time spent in Cuba as a young man may have influenced his interest in owning a sugar plantation.\n\nIn 1879, while President of the Company, he helped finance 50% of the cost for a church in the center of Easton. The cost was $1,400. Originally a Methodist church, the new denomination was affiliated with the Swedish Evangelical Covenant Church. Prior to the purchase of the new church, the growing number of Swedish immigrants who worked in the Company had to practice their religion in various private homes. Oakes Angier also lent the use of a hall on Main Street to the Swedish for services. Assistance in providing a place of worship was consistent with the Ames family tradition. They also had a chapel built on Pond St. for the Irish workforce.\n\nWilliam Chaffin wrote in History of the Town of Easton that Oakes Angier had a temperament well suited for work as manager to the Company workers, and that he was also very knowledgeable to the process of making shovels. His character would serve him well in regards to the strike. His life was an example of integrity and compassion towards workers and other townspeople who sometimes required assistance. Although there had been a few documented instances of dissension among workers before the strike of 1889, none were as well documented, nor did they result in so many workers being let go or disruption in shovel production.\n\nIn shovel making, it is the handlers job to weld straps to steel-edged shovels. Handlers employed by the Oliver Ames and Sons Company at the time of the strike became disgruntled over a Company policy that had been put in place years prior.\n\nOn February 22, 1889, twenty-three handlers walked off the job, returning the following day after forming a committee to speak with General Manager Oakes Angier Ames regarding the rules. He responded that the rules put in place were necessary and explained why that was. Despite that some of the Ames’ had been handlers themselves and the Company was known for good wages and fair business practices, the handlers did not return to work. Oakes Angier, after giving the strikers until March 4 to return, was forced to hire replacements. His son Hobart and Governor Oliver Ames' son William were in charge of training the Swedish replacement workers. Hobart was also in charge of protecting replacement workers from harassment by strikers. While Oakes Angier did request in writing that strikers leave tenement housing, he never evicted them. The only arrest was a James Riley for undue violence. On April 12, 1889, the strike ended and some sixteen strikers returned to work under the same rules. Only five strikers were not allowed to return to work as handlers. Two of them had already found work elsewhere and the other three were employed as gardeners on Ames estates. Shovel sales suffered but still managed to surpass previous years sales by $950.27.\n\nOakes Angier Ames' legacy to North Easton can still be seen in Queset House, his home beside the Queset Brook. Built of stone, Queset stands on property to the rear of the Ames Free Library. His son, famous theatrical producer Winthrop Ames, also lived in the house with his wife Lucy after inheriting it from his father. The property is now owned by the library and functions as a center for cultural programming. Queset was commissioned to be built in 1853 and it was completed the following year. The house's front portion design was drawn from a plan by noted architect Andrew Jackson Downing (who died in 1852). Downing collaborated with Alexander Jackson Davis who provided architectural drawings. It was built in the Gothic Revival style. Harvard educated architect John Ames Mitchell, (a first cousin of Oakes Angier and architect of Unity church in Easton, MA) designed the rear in 1873. He also added the copper-clad chimneys and a new staircase. The landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted planned its grounds and also, in consultation with Ames, created The Rockery nearby.\n\nTogether with his family, Ames commissioned Olmsted and architect H. H. Richardson to create a remarkable set of buildings and landscapes in North Easton, including:\n\n\nOakes Angier was a Unitarian (Unitarianism). He was chairman of the Church Committee and rarely, if ever, missed Sabbath. He married Catherine Hobart in East Bridgewater, Massachusetts on July 19, 1855. They had six children, although two did not survive past infancy:\n\n\nMrs. Oakes Angier died early morning Monday April 18, 1903. She lived a quiet life but was remembered at the time of her death as being heavily involved in local charitable work. She was not connected with any particular organization.\n\n\n\n"}

A partnership is a type of business entity in which partners share with each other the profits or losses of the business undertaking in which all have invested.\n\nFrom 1368 to 1911, partnerships with distributive shares were the principal form of a business entity that investors ran coal mines.\n\nIn the modern era, most enterprises were partnerships in the form of general partnerships levying unlimited liability on the partners. In 1933, 41% of factories were run by partnerships and 20% were sole proprietorships. After the end of the 1950s centralization of the economy caused the partnership form to vanish for nearly 30 years. In the 1980s partnerships returned with different names to avoid the sensitive label of private ownership.\n\nOn 1 June 2007, the Partnership Enterprise Law came into force and established partnerships as a legal business entity.\n\nThe term partnership enterprise refers to general partnerships and limited partnerships which may be established within China by natural persons, legal persons and other organizations. A state-funded company, state-owned company, listed company, public welfare-oriented public institution or social organization may not become a general partner of a limited partnership.\n\nA general partnership (普通合伙) may be formed by general partners who bear unlimited joint and several liability for the debts of the partnership. the general partners share unlimited liabilities for the debt of the partnership.\n\nA limited partnership (有限合伙) is formed by a combination of \"general partners\" and \"limited partners\" where the \"limited partners\" bear the liabilities for the partnership's debts to the extent of their capital contributions.\n\nA special general partnership (特殊普通合伙) resembles a general partnership except that it must be a professional service institution offering services requiring professional knowledge and special skills. The structure shields co-partners from liabilities due to the willful misconduct or gross negligence of one partner or a group of partners. It is intended as the preferred form of organization for law and accounting firms.\n\nA partnership requires a written agreement between the partners. This written agreement must be submitted to the business registration government body along with the identity of the partners.\n\nA partnership must abide by the following requirements:\n\nShould it be a general partnership or limited partnership then that shall be in its name.\n\nA limited partnership may not have less than 2 partners where one of them is a general partner nor may it have more than fifty partners.\n\nA partnership must pay all its debts with property contributed to the partnership by the partners. \n\nIf the partnership is a general partnership then the partners bear joint and several liability.\n\nA limited partner may not conclude partnership operations nor may such a partner represent the partnership to 3rd parties.\n\nA partner may contribute capital to the partnership to garner a share of the partnership's profits or losses. A capital contribution may include money, intellectual property right, land use right or other properties, or labor services at a valuation determined by agreement among the partners.\n\nIf the partnership is a limited partnership, then the limited partners may not make capital contributions with labor services.\n\nThe default distribution scheme of profits or losses follows the proportion to capital contributions made by the partners. However, the distribution scheme may follow an informal negotiated agreement or abide by scheme adopted in the partnership agreement. If the proportions of capital contributions cannot be discerned, then the profits or losses will be distributed equally by the partners.\n\nThe partnership agreement may not distribute all losses or all profits to just one or a group of partners within the partnership.\n\nThe partners shall pay tax on their respective share of the partnership income.\n\nThe required documents and procedures of partnership enterprise in China\n\n"}

The plaza occupies an area of about 50,000 square metres. It is especially known for its fountains and statues, its proximity to some of Barcelona's most popular attractions, and the flocks of pigeons that gather in the centre. \n\nAfter the medieval city walls were demolished in the 19th century, ambitious designs for the city's public spaces were conceived under the guidance of notable urban planners. Plaça Catalunya was conceived as part of \"pla Rovira\" in 1859, but no official permission from the government was given until the 1888 Universal Exposition. It was urbanised for the first time in 1902 and was further modified in 1929, on the occasion of the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition, which also included the construction of a metro station. Architect Francisco Nebot designed the changes made in 1929.\n\nIn May 2011 Plaça Catalunya was the main location where anti-government protests and sit ins were held in Barcelona, mirroring the events in other Spanish cities.\n\nPlaça Catalunya hosts quite a few interesting sculptures representative of Noucentisme, Neo-Classicism and different avant-garde movements.\n\nThe mosaics that decorate the walls of the underground part of Plaça Catalunya were designed by pupils of Escola Massana.\n\nA few theatres have been established in Plaça Catalunya since its construction, none of which are extant.\nThere still are, however, other theatres in the nearby area, located in other streets or squares.\n\nSimilarly, most of the cafés and restaurants where writers and artists would meet in the city haven't survived, with the notable exception of Café Zurich, where Fabiola of Belgium's brother worked as a pianist.

Family and friends of the suicide victim may be at increased risk of suicide themselves. Postvention is a term that was first coined by Shneidman (1972), which he used to describe \"appropriate and helpful acts that come after a dire event.\" In Schneidman's view, \"the largest public health problem is neither the prevention of suicide nor the management of suicide attempts, but the alleviation of the effects of stress in the survivors whose lives are forever altered.\" Postvention is a process that has the objective of alleviating the effects of this stress and helping survivors to cope with the loss they have just experienced. \nThe aim is to support and debrief those affected; and reduce the possibility of copycat suicide. Interventions recognize that those bereaved by suicide may be vulnerable to suicidal behaviour themselves and may develop complicated grief reactions.\nPostvention includes procedures to alleviate the distress of suicidally bereaved individuals, reduce the risk of imitative suicidal behavior, and promote the healthy recovery of the affected community. Postvention can also take many forms depending on the situation in which the suicide takes place. Schools and colleges may include postvention strategies in overall crisis plans. These strategies are designed to prevent suicide clusters and to help students cope with the emotions of loss that follow the suicide of a friend. Individual and group counseling may be offered for survivors (people affected by the suicide of an individual).\n\nThe Suicide Aftercare Association , a 501(c)(3) public charity, was formed to reduce the possibility of suicide contagion and secondary suicides by performing biohazardous cleaning of suicide attempt and completion scenes so families are relieved of this burden.\n\nResponding to Loss (RTL) is one of the crisis response programs that has been used to deal with postvention at high schools. This program is part of the Community Action for Youth Survival (CAYS), which is a three-year adolescent suicide prevention project serving three counties in the Chicago area. The objective of RTL is to provide strategies that will help high school crisis teams develop a structured response to the suicide of any student or member of the staff. There are three components to this program. The first is Preparing for Crisis Training, the second is Peer Witness Intervention, and the third is Crisis Consultation. This program proved to be quite successful during its trial and the participants of the program were generally satisfied with the training that they received. As a result of this program, several schools have developed or revised their crisis team in response to a suicide. They have done this by following the Preparing for Crisis training aspect of the program and also through consulting with the CAYS program.\n\nThe LOSS Program includes a first-response team with the objectives of delivering immediate services to the survivors of a suicide at the time of the death. This team is made up of para-professional survivor volunteers and staff members of the Baton Rouge Crisis Intervention Center, located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The LOSS Program is different from other postvention programs in several ways. First, the LOSS team physically goes to the scenes of the suicides to begin helping the survivors to cope with their loss as close to the event of death as possible. Members of this team can provide access to the needed resources and can begin the grieving process at the scene of the death. Second, since the LOSS team includes survivor volunteers at the scene, an immediate and meaningful bond is established between the newly bereaved individuals and the para-professional surveyor team members. This bond allows for the start of a conversation about the grief and the potential for hope of a suicide between the bereaved and the crisis team members. Third, the LOSS team has a strong relationship with other first responders, such as law enforcement, emergency services, fire departments, funeral home representatives, and more. This relationship allows the newly bereaved to have a larger variety of choices in regards to coping with a suicide compared to other survivors who might not have access to this program. This model of postvention provides referrals for additional support to all survivors and individuals at the scene of the suicide The model of the LOSS Program has changed the scene of the suicide to a more \"concerned and caring environment\" for all individuals and survivors.\n"}

The leading producing countries are Finland, Sweden and Germany. The industry is a large user of renewable energy and achieved a recycling rate of 71.5% in 2015.\n\nThe European paper industry produces more than 90 million tonnes of paper and board and more than 36 million tonnes of pulp annually. Directly it provides 178,000 jobs and indirectly 3 million jobs along the forest and paper chain. The European paper industry's turnover is approximately 180 billion euros. 633 companies are represented by the Confederation of European Paper Industries (CEPI) and these account for 23% of world production.\nThe raw material consists of 40% recycled fibre and 44% virgin pulp, the balance being other pulp (1%) and non-fibrous materials (15%). 94% of the wood requirements come from managed forests within Europe.\n\nIn national terms the largest \"paper\" producer is Germany, followed by Finland, Sweden and France; the largest \"pulp\" producers are Finland and Sweden. The two largest European companies in the sector, Stora Enso and UPM, are both based in Finland.\n\nThe European pulp and paper industry is the largest industrial producer and consumer of energy from renewable sources. Its share of biomass-based energy exceeds 55% of its total primary annual energy consumption of 1,301,483 TJ. The sector has adopted an objective to reduce carbon emissions of 80% by 2050, which is likely to involve new technological methods to reduce water usage and thus reduce energy usage.\n\nPaper for recycling is a major source of the paper industry’s raw material, which is why the industry aims to maximise the European recycling rate. The recycling rate along the paper value chain (ERPC) reached 71.5% in 2015 - exceeding the voluntary target of 70% that was set by the industries declaration in 2011. The total amount of paper collected and sent to recycling in paper mills in 2015 was almost 56 million tonnes. 18.2% was exported for recycling in third countries in 2015. The recycling rate is now considered close to its maximum possible.\n\nThe European paper industry is a highly innovative sector. Its strategic vision of reconciling sustainability and competitiveness, the inherent properties of its raw materials, and the transformation the sector is going through, are already delivering new products, new technologies, new bio-values, and business opportunities. \nIn 2011, the Confederation of European Paper Industries (CEPI) launched the “2050 Roadmap to a low-carbon bioeconomy”, as the very first European manufacturing industry sector to react to the European Commission’s roadmap towards a low-carbon economy with its own sector roadmap. The “Two Team Project”, which ran in 2013, sought to find the most innovative breakthrough technologies of the industry with two teams competing against each other. Eight breakthrough technologies made it to the publication. \nIn 2015, CEPI collected more than 40 of the industry’s most innovative products in another publication, “The Age of Fibre”, showcasing once again the versatility and innovation in the industry.\n\nIn 2011 the top 10 forest and paper products companies in Europe were:\n\n"}

{"id": "2003591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003591", "title": "Secondary liability", "text": "Secondary liability\n\nSecondary liability, or indirect infringement, arises when a party materially contributes to, facilitates, induces, or is otherwise responsible for directly infringing acts carried out by another party. The US has statutorily codified secondary liability rules for trademarks and patents, but for matters relating to copyright, this has solely been a product of case law developments. In other words, courts, rather than Congress, have been the primary developers of theories and policies concerning secondary liability.\n\nSecondary liability in copyright has come about with case-by-case decisions. In other words, there has not been any real or consolidated theory. Furthermore, patent and copyright cases have tended to cross-cite each other. Examples of this are cases such as \"Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers\" (the producer of the movie Ben Hur (1907 film) didn't himself infringe, but was responsible for making and commercially distributing the infringing film), \"Shapiro, Bernstein and Co. v. H.L. Green Co.\" (a booth in a department store that sold infringing sound recordings and the store was ultimately held liable), and the so-called \"dance hall\" cases (the operator of an entertainment establishment was held liable because he had effective control of the premises \"and\" obtained a direct financial benefit derived from charging entrance fees to the public).\n\nThe Copyright Act of 1790 did not provide a formal definition of infringement, stating only that “any person or persons who shall print or publish any manuscript, without the consent and approbation of the author or proprietor thereof... shall be liable to suffer and pay to the said author or proprietor all damages occasioned by such injury.” Furthermore, the Copyright Act of 1909 simply provided that any person who “shall infringe the copyright in any work protected under the copyright laws of the United States… shall be liable” for various remedies.\n\nDespite the fact that the Copyright Act of 1909 did not explicitly establish liability for acts committed by a party different than the direct infringer, several cases decided under this Act set forth the guidelines under which a party may be deemed secondarily liable. Examples of the gradual recognition by courts of copyright liability extending to those who contribute to or vicariously profit from the infringing acts of others are \"Fishel v. Lueckel\" and \"Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers\".\n\nThere are generally two kinds of secondary liability developed by courts – vicarious liability and contributory liability. Although the line between these categories of liability is blurry, a precondition for all forms of secondary liability is the underlying act (or acts) of infringement. However, unlike contributory infringement, knowledge is not an element of vicarious liability. 907 F. Supp. 1361, **36, citing 3 NIMMER ON COPYRIGHT § 12.04{A}{1}, at 12-70 (1995)\n\nSome academics have classified the active inducement adopted in \"MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.\" as a new type of secondary liability because it is based on express acts of inducement and not on a mere failure to act; furthermore, the specific intent to bring about infringing acts is another important factor in this analysis.\n\nOne of the theories widely accepted as a basis for liability in copyright infringement cases is vicarious liability.\nThe concept of vicarious liability was developed in the Second Circuit as an extension of the common law doctrine of agency – \"respondeat superior\" (the responsibility of the superior for the acts of their subordinate). Pursuant to this doctrine, courts recognized that employers should be liable for the infringing acts of their employees under traditional master-servant principles. An example of this is \"M. Witmark & Sons v. Calloway\".\n\nBeyond the master-servant context, however, courts have extended liability to those who profit from infringing activity when an enterprise has the right and ability to prevent the infringement. Under \"Dreamland Ball Room v. Shapiro, Bernstein & Co.\", “[T]he owner of a dance hall at whose place copyrighted musical compositions are played in violation of the rights of the copyright holder is liable, if the playing be for the profit of the proprietor of the dance hall. And this is so even though the orchestra be employed under a contract that would ordinarily make it an independent contractor.” By contrast, courts did not extend liability to landlords who leased premises to a direct infringer for a fixed rental and did not participate directly in organizing or soliciting the infringing activity. For example, \"Deutsch v. Arnold\", \"Fonovisa v. Cherry Auction\" (extending liability to the operator of a swap meet who repeatedly leased booth space to concessionaires selling infringing tapes).\n\nThe landmark case on vicarious liability for sales of counterfeit recordings is \"Shapiro, Bernstein and Co. v. H.L. Green Co.\" In \"Shapiro\", the court was faced with a copyright infringement suit against the owner of a chain of department stores where a concessionaire was selling counterfeit recordings. The \"Shapiro\" court ultimately imposed liability, even though the defendant was unaware of the infringement, reasoning that the store proprietor had the power to cease the conduct of the concessionaire, and because the proprietor obtained direct financial benefit from the infringement.\n\nContributory liability or contributory infringement has been widely defined as a form of liability on the part of someone who is not directly infringing but nevertheless is making contributions to the infringing acts of others. Material contributions to the act (or enabling thereof), as well as knowledge of the act itself, are key elements of contributory liability. Additionally, in the course of performing such material contributions, the parties know that they are materially infringing copyrighted content.\n\nContributory liability is rooted in the tort theory of enterprise liability. Contributory liability holds the third party liable for the primary act based on the third party's relationship with the actual harm - either by enabling or by benefiting from it. As the court stated in \"Gershwin Publ’g Corp. v. Columbia Artists Mgmt.\": “one who, with knowledge of the infringing activity, induces, causes, or materially contributes … may be held liable as a contributory infringer.”\n\nNot long after the passage of the 1976 Copyright Act, the scope of contributory infringement liability was tested in a case in which the copyright owners claimed that the sale of a recording device – the VCR - illegally contributed to infringement. In \"Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.\" was established a variant on contributory liability claims with respect to technologies. When Universal City Studios initially sued Sony for making and selling the Betamax, the theory was that Sony materially contributed to acts of infringement performed by users of the Betamax, and knew or had reason to know that the technology would be used for infringing purposes. The Supreme Court of the United States held that, even though material contributions and knowledge of the infringement are generally sufficient to establish secondary liability, in the case of infringing technology, contributory liability cannot be imposed unless the technology lacks substantial non-infringing uses. As the Court phrased the \"Sony\" exception with regard to new technologies: \"The sale of copying equipment, like the sale of other articles of commerce, does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable purposes. Indeed, it need merely be capable of substantial noninfringing uses.\"\n\nRegarding internet communications, sometimes the most promising remedy is only available from the standpoint of the internet intermediary (e.g. delete the post, take down the link). In fact, the internet is a special field for secondary liability, because the open architecture of the internet facilitates many communications and users need intermediaries in order to access and contact each other's services.\n\nThe question of whether Internet service providers (ISPs) should be held liable for the actions of network users is unresolved. As to copyright, however, ISPs remain liable, in all territories, as primary, direct infringers of copyright for the copies they make on behalf of their customers, so the issue of additional secondary liability is less significant. An ISP's direct liability arises from the ISP's own actions, not the actions of another party. The confusion arises from the fact that two parties are directly liable in the usual case of internet infringement: the ISP and the ISP's customer. In legal terms, they are joint tortfeasors. This is because they both independently commit all of the acts necessary to establish liability under the copyright laws of most jurisdictions. In situations truly involving secondary liability, the party whose secondary liability is claimed has at least not committed one element required for an infringement action. This situation is not present in the usual ISP situation, as the ISP is always in the position of making copies (without authorization of the rights owner), so it is irrelevant that someone else has infringed the same copyright earlier in time. The ISP's liability is direct, not derivative. It is based on the ISP's own actions, not on someone else's.\n\nRecent statutes in the United States (Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998) and the European Union have provided significant, though not total, immunity from primary copyright liability that, in the absence of those statutes, would exist for ISPs.\n\nThe DMCA states four safe harbors:\n(a) Transitory network communications\n(b) System caching\n(c) Information storage and\n(d) Information location tools. \nThe last three have so called “notice & take down” rules for specificity in notice of infringement, counter-notice and put-back and liability if false notice has been given.\n\nIn order to be eligible for the safe harbor provisions, it is required that the service provider has adopted and reasonably implemented a policy to terminate the accounts of repetitive infringers. In addition, ISPs must accommodate and not interfere with standard technical measures used by copyright owners to protect their works.\n\nAs to trademarks, in the absence of statutory guidance, courts have extended both types of secondary liability (vicarious and contributory) to third parties, including in some circumstances ISPs. Here, too, the question whether ISPs will be held liable for the acts of their infringing customers will depend on the degree of the ISP's knowledge and involvement in the specific infringing activity.\n\nFuture treatment of secondary liability by US courts is uncertain. Some cases and commentators have argued for broadening secondary liability through cost-benefit analysis, multi-factor balancing tests, or simply basing it on technical designs or business models.\n\nThe proposed EU directive would make aiding and abetting infringement a basis for liability.\nIn light of the above, it is permissible to conclude that there is no consensus on this issue.\n\n\n"}

A member of the National Liberal Party and formerly of the Democratic Liberal Party (PD-L), she was a member of the Romanian Senate for Vrancea County from 2008 to 2012. In the Emil Boc cabinet, she was Minister of Youth and Sport from July to December 2009, and interim Minister-Delegate for Relations with Parliament from October to December 2009.\n\nShe was born in Focșani and graduated from the Textile Technology and Chemistry faculty of the Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iași in 1989. From that year until 1993, she worked as an engineer at a worsted wool spinning mill in Focșani. From 1993 to 1994, she was assistant manager of an import-export firm in Bucharest. She was then active at three textile firms in Focșani until November 2008: at Soreste, she was stockholder, administrator and board president from 1994; at Milcofil, later purchased by Soreste, she was board president from 1997; and at Artifex, a joint venture between Soreste and Akris, she was administrator and general director from 2005.\n\nIn 1997, Plăcintă joined the Democratic Party (PD; later evolved into the PD-L). At the 2008 election, she won a Senate seat, and became vice president of that chamber's agriculture, forestry and rural development committee. In July 2009, following the resignation of scandal-plagued minister Monica Iacob Ridzi, Plăcintă was given the Youth and Sport portfolio and sworn in the same day. Her appointment was criticised by Vrancea County Council and PSD chapter president Marian Oprișan, who noted her links to the ministry were as close as those between \"an old woman and a machine gun\", and who pointed out she had contributed hundreds of thousands of euros to her party. The following month, she announced plans to cut in half the number of positions at her ministry. In October 2009, she became interim Minister for Relations with Parliament following the resignation of her PSD cabinet colleagues, including Victor Ponta, the previous occupant of that ministry, holding the portfolio until December. Her ministerial term ended when she was not reappointed to a new cabinet under Boc at the end of 2009. Nearly a year later, she was elected a vice president of the Bucharest PD-L chapter. She resigned from the PD-L in June 2012, crossing to the PNL. She left the Senate at the end of 2012, having declined to run in that year's election.\n\nShe has one son from her first marriage, Andrei Plăcintă, who at one time lived in Montreux, Switzerland and was pastor of the First Church of Atheism, an organisation seeking to eliminate religious belief from the world. Plăcintă herself is the \"ktitorissa\" of two Romanian Orthodox churches. In 2012, her son was sentenced to six years' imprisonment for attempted manslaughter, theft and indecent exposure, charges that stemmed from an incident that took place in Bucharest two years earlier; the sentence was ultimately reduced to four and a half years. Her second husband was Stefan Sobota, her former business partner, who immigrated from Sweden in 1992; in 2010, she announced they would divorce. This had taken place by the following year, when she secretly married urologist Viorel Bucuraș, adopting his surname in 2012.\n\n"}
{"id": "52328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52328", "title": "Stock market", "text": "Stock market\n\nA stock market, equity market or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers (a loose network of economic transactions, not a physical facility or discrete entity) of stocks (also called shares), which represent ownership claims on businesses; these may include \"securities\" listed on a public stock exchange, as well as stock that is only traded privately. Examples of the latter include shares of private companies which are sold to investors through equity crowdfunding platforms. Stock exchanges list shares of common equity as well as other security types, e.g. corporate bonds and convertible bonds.\n\nStocks are categorized in various ways. One way is by the country where the company is domiciled. For example, Nestlé and Novartis are domiciled in Switzerland, so they may be considered as part of the Swiss stock market, although their stock may also be traded on exchanges in other countries, for example, as American depository receipts (ADRs) on U.S. stock markets.\n\nAs of mid 2017, the size of the world stock market (total market capitalization) was about US$76.3 trillion. By country, the largest market was the United States (about 34%), followed by Japan (about 6%) and the United Kingdom (about 6%). These numbers increased in 2013.\n\nAs of 2015, there are a total of 60 stock exchanges in the world with a total market capitalization of $69 trillion. Of these, there are 16 exchanges with a market capitalization of $1 trillion or more, and they account for 87% of global market capitalization. Apart from the Australian Securities Exchange, these 16 exchanges are based in one of three continents: North America, Europe and Asia.\n\nA stock exchange is an exchange (or bourse) where stock brokers and traders can buy and sell shares of stock, bonds, and other securities. Many large companies have their stocks listed on a stock exchange. This makes the stock more liquid and thus more attractive to many investors. The exchange may also act as a guarantor of settlement. Other stocks may be traded \"over the counter\" (OTC), that is, through a dealer. Some large companies will have their stock listed on more than one exchange in different countries, so as to attract international investors. \n\nStock exchanges may also cover other types of securities, such as fixed interest securities (bonds) or (less frequently) derivatives which are more likely to be traded OTC.\n\nTrade in stock markets means the transfer (in exchange for money) of a stock or security from a seller to a buyer. This requires these two parties to agree on a price. Equities (stocks or shares) confer an ownership interest in a particular company.\n\nParticipants in the stock market range from small individual stock investors to larger investors, who can be based anywhere in the world, and may include banks, insurance companies, pension funds and hedge funds. Their buy or sell orders may be executed on their behalf by a stock exchange trader.\n\nSome exchanges are physical locations where transactions are carried out on a trading floor, by a method known as open outcry. This method is used in some stock exchanges and commodity exchanges, and involves traders shouting bid and offer prices. The other type of stock exchange has a network of computers where trades are made electronically. An example of such an exchange is the NASDAQ.\n\nA potential buyer \"bids\" a specific price for a stock, and a potential seller \"asks\" a specific price for the same stock. Buying or selling \"at the market\" means you will accept \"any\" ask price or bid price for the stock. When the bid and ask prices match, a sale takes place, on a first-come, first-served basis if there are multiple bidders at a given price.\n\nThe purpose of a stock exchange is to facilitate the exchange of securities between buyers and sellers, thus providing a marketplace. The exchanges provide real-time trading information on the listed securities, facilitating price discovery.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is a physical exchange, with a hybrid market for placing orders electronically from any location as well as on the trading floor. Orders executed on the trading floor enter by way of exchange members and flow down to a floor broker, who submits the order electronically to the floor trading post for the Designated Market Maker (\"DMM\") for that stock to trade the order. The DMM's job is to maintain a two-sided market, making orders to buy and sell the security when there are no other buyers or sellers. If a spread exists, no trade immediately takes place – in this case the DMM may use their own resources (money or stock) to close the difference. Once a trade has been made, the details are reported on the \"tape\" and sent back to the brokerage firm, which then notifies the investor who placed the order. Computers play an important role, especially for program trading.\n\nThe NASDAQ is a virtual exchange, where all of the trading is done over a computer network. The process is similar to the New York Stock Exchange. One or more NASDAQ market makers will always provide a bid and ask price at which they will always purchase or sell 'their' stock.\n\nThe Paris Bourse, now part of Euronext, is an order-driven, electronic stock exchange. It was automated in the late 1980s. Prior to the 1980s, it consisted of an open outcry exchange. Stockbrokers met on the trading floor of the Palais Brongniart. In 1986, the CATS trading system was introduced, and the order matching process was fully automated.\n\nPeople trading stock will prefer to trade on the most popular exchange since this gives the largest number of potential counter parties (buyers for a seller, sellers for a buyer) and probably the best price. However, there have always been alternatives such as brokers trying to bring parties together to trade outside the exchange. Some third markets that were popular are Instinet, and later Island and Archipelago (the latter two have since been acquired by Nasdaq and NYSE, respectively). One advantage is that this avoids the commissions of the exchange. However, it also has problems such as adverse selection. Financial regulators are probing dark pools.\n\nMarket participants include individual retail investors, institutional investors such as mutual funds, banks, insurance companies and hedge funds, and also publicly traded corporations trading in their own shares. Some studies have suggested that institutional investors and corporations trading in their own shares generally receive higher risk-adjusted returns than retail investors.\n\nA few decades ago, most buyers and sellers were individual investors, such as wealthy businessmen, usually with long family histories to particular corporations. Over time, markets have become more \"institutionalized\"; buyers and sellers are largely institutions (e.g., pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, index funds, exchange-traded funds, hedge funds, investor groups, banks and various other financial institutions).\n\nThe rise of the institutional investor has brought with it some improvements in market operations. There has been a gradual tendency for \"fixed\" (and exorbitant) fees being reduced for all investors, partly from falling administration costs but also assisted by large institutions challenging brokers' oligopolistic approach to setting standardized fees. A current trend in stock market investments includes the decrease in fees due to computerized asset management termed Robo Advisers within the industry. Automation has decreased portfolio management costs by lowering the cost associated with investing as a whole.\n\nStock market participation refers to the number of agents who buy and sell equity backed securities either directly or indirectly in a financial exchange. Participants are generally subdivided into three distinct sectors; households, institutions, and foreign traders. Direct participation occurs when any of the above entities buys or sells securities on its own behalf on an exchange. Indirect participation occurs when an institutional investor exchanges a stock on behalf of an individual or household. Indirect investment occurs in the form of pooled investment accounts, retirement accounts, and other managed financial accounts.\n\nThe total value of equity-backed securities in the United States rose over 600% in the 25 years between 1989 and 2012 as market capitalization expanded from $2,790 billion to $18,668 billion. Direct ownership of stock by individuals rose slightly from 17.8% in 1992 to 17.9% in 2007, with the median value of these holdings rising from $14,778 to $17,000. Indirect participation in the form of retirement accounts rose from 39.3% in 1992 to 52.6% in 2007, with the median value of these accounts more than doubling from $22,000 to $45,000 in that time. Rydqvist, Spizman, and Strebulaev attribute the differential growth in direct and indirect holdings to differences in the way each are taxed in the United States. Investments in pension funds and 401ks, the two most common vehicles of indirect participation, are taxed only when funds are withdrawn from the accounts. Conversely, the money used to directly purchase stock is subject to taxation as are any dividends or capital gains they generate for the holder. In this way the current tax code incentivizes individuals to invest indirectly.\n\nRates of participation and the value of holdings differs significantly across strata of income. In the bottom quintile of income, 5.5% of households directly own stock and 10.7% hold stocks indirectly in the form of retirement accounts. The top decile of income has a direct participation rate of 47.5% and an indirect participation rate in the form of retirement accounts of 89.6%. The median value of directly owned stock in the bottom quintile of income is $4,000 and is $78,600 in the top decile of income as of 2007. The median value of indirectly held stock in the form of retirement accounts for the same two groups in the same year is $6,300 and $214,800 respectively. Since the Great Recession of 2008 households in the bottom half of the income distribution have lessened their participation rate both directly and indirectly from 53.2% in 2007 to 48.8% in 2013, while over the same time period households in the top decile of the income distribution slightly increased participation 91.7% to 92.1%. The mean value of direct and indirect holdings at the bottom half of the income distribution moved slightly downward from $53,800 in 2007 to $53,600 in 2013. In the top decile, mean value of all holdings fell from $982,000 to $969,300 in the same time. The mean value of all stock holdings across the entire income distribution is valued at $269,900 as of 2013.\n\nThe racial composition of stock market ownership shows households headed by whites are nearly four and six times as likely to directly own stocks than households headed by blacks and Hispanics respectively. As of 2011 the national rate of direct participation was 19.6%, for white households the participation rate was 24.5%, for black households it was 6.4% and for Hispanic households it was 4.3% Indirect participation in the form of 401k ownership shows a similar pattern with a national participation rate of 42.1%, a rate of 46.4% for white households, 31.7% for black households, and 25.8% for Hispanic households. Households headed by married couples participated at rates above the national averages with 25.6% participating directly and 53.4% participating indirectly through a retirement account. 14.7% of households headed by men participated in the market directly and 33.4% owned stock through a retirement account. 12.6% of female headed households directly owned stock and 28.7% owned stock indirectly.\n\nIn a 2003 paper by Vissing-Jørgensen attempts to explain disproportionate rates of participation along wealth and income groups as a function of fixed costs associated with investing. Her research concludes that a fixed cost of $200 per year is sufficient to explain why nearly half of all U.S. households do not participate in the market. Participation rates have been shown to strongly correlate with education levels, promoting the hypothesis that information and transaction costs of market participation are better absorbed by more educated households. Behavioral economists Harrison Hong, Jeffrey Kubik and Jeremy Stein suggest that sociability and participation rates of communities have a statistically significant impact on an individual’s decision to participate in the market. Their research indicates that social individuals living in states with higher than average participation rates are 5% more likely to participate than individuals that do not share those characteristics. This phenomenon also explained in cost terms. Knowledge of market functioning diffuses through communities and consequently lowers transaction costs associated with investing.\n\nIn 12th-century France, the \"courretiers de change\" were concerned with managing and regulating the debts of agricultural communities on behalf of the banks. Because these men also traded with debts, they could be called the first brokers. A common misbelief is that, in late 13th-century Bruges, commodity traders gathered inside the house of a man called \"Van der Beurze\", and in 1409 they became the \"Brugse Beurse\", institutionalizing what had been, until then, an informal meeting, but actually, the family Van der Beurze had a building in Antwerp where those gatherings occurred; the Van der Beurze had Antwerp, as most of the merchants of that period, as their primary place for trading. The idea quickly spread around Flanders and neighboring countries and \"Beurzen\" soon opened in Ghent and Rotterdam.\n\nIn the middle of the 13th century, Venetian bankers began to trade in government securities. In 1351 the Venetian government outlawed spreading rumors intended to lower the price of government funds. Bankers in Pisa, Verona, Genoa and Florence also began trading in government securities during the 14th century. This was only possible because these were independent city-states not ruled by a duke but a council of influential citizens. Italian companies were also the first to issue shares. Companies in England and the Low Countries followed in the 16th century.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch pioneered several financial innovations that helped lay the foundations of the modern financial system. While the Italian city-states produced the first transferable government bonds, they did not develop the other ingredient necessary to produce a fully fledged capital market: the stock market. In the early 1600s the Dutch East India Company (VOC) became the first company in history to issue bonds and shares of stock to the general public. As Edward Stringham (2015) notes, \"companies with transferable shares date back to classical Rome, but these were usually not enduring endeavors and no considerable secondary market existed (Neal, 1997, p. 61).\" The Dutch East India Company (founded in the year of 1602) was also the first joint-stock company to get a fixed capital stock and as a result, continuous trade in company stock occurred on the Amsterdam Exchange. Soon thereafter, a lively trade in various derivatives, among which options and repos, emerged on the Amsterdam market. Dutch traders also pioneered short selling – a practice which was banned by the Dutch authorities as early as 1610. Amsterdam-based businessman Joseph de la Vega's \"Confusion de Confusiones\" (1688) was the earliest known book about stock trading and first book on the inner workings of the stock market (including the stock exchange).\n\nThere are now stock markets in virtually every developed and most developing economies, with the world's largest markets being in the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, India, China, Canada, Germany (Frankfurt Stock Exchange), France, South Korea and the Netherlands.\n\nThe stock market is one of the most important ways for companies to raise money, along with debt markets which are generally more imposing but do not trade publicly. This allows businesses to be publicly traded, and raise additional financial capital for expansion by selling shares of ownership of the company in a public market. The liquidity that an exchange affords the investors enables their holders to quickly and easily sell securities. This is an attractive feature of investing in stocks, compared to other less liquid investments such as property and other immoveable assets. Some companies actively increase liquidity by trading in their own shares.\n\nHistory has shown that the price of stocks and other assets is an important part of the dynamics of economic activity, and can influence or be an indicator of social mood. An economy where the stock market is on the rise is considered to be an up-and-coming economy. The stock market is often considered the primary indicator of a country's economic strength and development.\n\nRising share prices, for instance, tend to be associated with increased business investment and vice versa. Share prices also affect the wealth of households and their consumption. Therefore, central banks tend to keep an eye on the control and behavior of the stock market and, in general, on the smooth operation of financial system functions. Financial stability is the raison d'être of central banks.\n\nExchanges also act as the clearinghouse for each transaction, meaning that they collect and deliver the shares, and guarantee payment to the seller of a security. This eliminates the risk to an individual buyer or seller that the counterparty could default on the transaction.\n\nThe smooth functioning of all these activities facilitates economic growth in that lower costs and enterprise risks promote the production of goods and services as well as possibly employment. In this way the financial system is assumed to contribute to increased prosperity, although some controversy exists as to whether the optimal financial system is bank-based or market-based.\n\nRecent events such as the Global Financial Crisis have prompted a heightened degree of scrutiny of the impact of the structure of stock markets (called market microstructure), in particular to the stability of the financial system and the transmission of systemic risk.\n\nThe financial system in most western countries has undergone a remarkable transformation. One feature of this development is disintermediation. A portion of the funds involved in saving and financing, flows directly to the financial markets instead of being routed via the traditional bank lending and deposit operations. The general public interest in investing in the stock market, either directly or through mutual funds, has been an important component of this process.\n\nStatistics show that in recent decades, shares have made up an increasingly large proportion of households' financial assets in many countries. In the 1970s, in Sweden, deposit accounts and other very liquid assets with little risk made up almost 60 percent of households' financial wealth, compared to less than 20 percent in the 2000s. The major part of this adjustment is that financial portfolios have gone directly to shares but a good deal now takes the form of various kinds of institutional investment for groups of individuals, e.g., pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, insurance investment of premiums, etc.\n\nThe trend towards forms of saving with a higher risk has been accentuated by new rules for most funds and insurance, permitting a higher proportion of shares to bonds. Similar tendencies are to be found in other developed countries. In all developed economic systems, such as the European Union, the United States, Japan and other developed nations, the trend has been the same: saving has moved away from traditional (government insured) \"bank deposits to more risky securities of one sort or another\".\n\nA second transformation is the move to electronic trading to replace human trading of listed securities.\n\nCompared to Other Asset Classes Over the long term, investing in a well diversified portfolio of stocks such as an S&P 500 Index outperforms other investment vehicles such as Treasury Bills and Bonds, with the S&P 500 having a geometric annual average of 9.55% from 1928 to 2013.\n\nInvestors may temporarily move financial prices away from market equilibrium. Over-reactions may occur—so that excessive optimism (euphoria) may drive prices unduly high or excessive pessimism may drive prices unduly low. Economists continue to debate whether financial markets are generally efficient.\n\nAccording to one interpretation of the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH), only changes in fundamental factors, such as the outlook for margins, profits or dividends, ought to affect share prices beyond the short term, where random 'noise' in the system may prevail. The 'hard' efficient-market hypothesis does not explain the cause of events such as the crash in 1987, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 22.6 percent—the largest-ever one-day fall in the United States.\n\nThis event demonstrated that share prices can fall dramatically even though no generally agreed upon definite cause has been found: a thorough search failed to detect \"any\" 'reasonable' development that might have accounted for the crash. (Note that such events are predicted to occur strictly by chance, although very rarely.) It seems also to be the case more generally that many price movements (beyond that which are predicted to occur 'randomly') are \"not\" occasioned by new information; a study of the fifty largest one-day share price movements in the United States in the post-war period seems to confirm this.\n\nA 'soft' EMH has emerged which does not require that prices remain at or near equilibrium, but only that market participants not be able to \"systematically\" profit from any momentary market 'inefficiencies'. Moreover, while EMH predicts that all price movement (in the absence of change in fundamental information) is random (i.e., non-trending), many studies have shown a marked tendency for the stock market to trend over time periods of weeks or longer. Various explanations for such large and apparently non-random price movements have been promulgated. For instance, some research has shown that changes in estimated risk, and the use of certain strategies, such as stop-loss limits and value at risk limits, \"theoretically could\" cause financial markets to overreact. But the best explanation seems to be that the distribution of stock market prices is non-Gaussian (in which case EMH, in any of its current forms, would not be strictly applicable).\n\nOther research has shown that psychological factors may result in \"exaggerated\" (statistically anomalous) stock price movements (contrary to EMH which assumes such behaviors 'cancel out'). Psychological research has demonstrated that people are predisposed to 'seeing' patterns, and often will perceive a pattern in what is, in fact, just \"noise\", e.g. seeing familiar shapes in clouds or ink blots. In the present context this means that a succession of good news items about a company may lead investors to overreact positively, driving the price up. A period of good returns also boosts the investors' self-confidence, reducing their (psychological) risk threshold.\n\nAnother phenomenon—also from psychology—that works against an objective assessment is \"group thinking\". As social animals, it is not easy to stick to an opinion that differs markedly from that of a majority of the group. An example with which one may be familiar is the reluctance to enter a restaurant that is empty; people generally prefer to have their opinion validated by those of others in the group.\n\nIn one paper the authors draw an analogy with gambling. In normal times the market behaves like a game of roulette; the probabilities are known and largely independent of the investment decisions of the different players. In times of market stress, however, the game becomes more like poker (herding behavior takes over). The players now must give heavy weight to the psychology of other investors and how they are likely to react psychologically.\n\nIn the period running up to the 1987 crash, less than 1 percent of the analyst's recommendations had been to sell (and even during the 2000–2002 bear market, the average did not rise above 5%). In the run-up to 2000, the media amplified the general euphoria, with reports of rapidly rising share prices and the notion that large sums of money could be quickly earned in the so-called new economy stock market.\n\nStock markets play an essential role in growing industries that ultimately affect the economy through transferring available funds from units that have excess funds (savings) to those who are suffering from funds deficit (borrowings) (Padhi and Naik, 2012). In other words, capital markets facilitate funds movement between the above-mentioned units. This process leads to the enhancement of available financial resources which in turn affects the economic growth positively. Moreover, both economic and financial theories argue that stock prices are affected by macroeconomic trends.\n\nMany different academic researchers have stated companies with low P/E ratios and smaller sized companies have a tendency to outperform the market. Research carried out states mid-sized companies outperform large cap companies and smaller companies have higher returns historically.\n\nSometimes, the market seems to react irrationally to economic or financial news, even if that news is likely to have no real effect on the fundamental value of securities itself. However, this market behaviour may be more apparent than real, since often such news was anticipated, and a counterreaction may occur if the news is better (or worse) than expected. Therefore, the stock market may be swayed in either direction by press releases, rumors, euphoria and mass panic.\n\nOver the short-term, stocks and other securities can be battered or buoyed by any number of fast market-changing events, making the stock market behavior difficult to predict. Emotions can drive prices up and down, people are generally not as rational as they think, and the reasons for buying and selling are generally accepted.\n\nBehaviorists argue that investors often behave \"irrationally\" when making investment decisions thereby incorrectly pricing securities, which causes market inefficiencies, which, in turn, are opportunities to make money. However, the whole notion of EMH is that these non-rational reactions to information cancel out, leaving the prices of stocks rationally determined.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average biggest gain in one day was 936.42 points or 11%.\n\nA stock market crash is often defined as a sharp dip in share prices of stocks listed on the stock exchanges. In parallel with various economic factors, a reason for stock market crashes is also due to panic and investing public's loss of confidence. Often, stock market crashes end speculative economic bubbles.\n\nThere have been famous stock market crashes that have ended in the loss of billions of dollars and wealth destruction on a massive scale. An increasing number of people are involved in the stock market, especially since the social security and retirement plans are being increasingly privatized and linked to stocks and bonds and other elements of the market. There have been a number of famous stock market crashes like the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the stock market crash of 1973–4, the Black Monday of 1987, the Dot-com bubble of 2000, and the Stock Market Crash of 2008.\n\nOne of the most famous stock market crashes started October 24, 1929, on Black Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 50% during this stock market crash. It was the beginning of the Great Depression. Another famous crash took place on October 19, 1987 – Black Monday. The crash began in Hong Kong and quickly spread around the world.\n\nBy the end of October, stock markets in Hong Kong had fallen 45.5%, Australia 41.8%, Spain 31%, the United Kingdom 26.4%, the United States 22.68%, and Canada 22.5%. Black Monday itself was the largest one-day percentage decline in stock market history – the Dow Jones fell by 22.6% in a day. The names \"Black Monday\" and \"Black Tuesday\" are also used for October 28–29, 1929, which followed Terrible Thursday—the starting day of the stock market crash in 1929.\n\nThe crash in 1987 raised some puzzles – main news and events did not predict the catastrophe and visible reasons for the collapse were not identified. This event raised questions about many important assumptions of modern economics, namely, the theory of rational human conduct, the theory of market equilibrium and the efficient-market hypothesis. For some time after the crash, trading in stock exchanges worldwide was halted, since the exchange computers did not perform well owing to enormous quantity of trades being received at one time. This halt in trading allowed the Federal Reserve System and central banks of other countries to take measures to control the spreading of worldwide financial crisis. In the United States the SEC introduced several new measures of control into the stock market in an attempt to prevent a re-occurrence of the events of Black Monday.\n\nSince the early 1990s, many of the largest exchanges have adopted electronic 'matching engines' to bring together buyers and sellers, replacing the open outcry system. Electronic trading now accounts for the majority of trading in many developed countries. Computer systems were upgraded in the stock exchanges to handle larger trading volumes in a more accurate and controlled manner. The SEC modified the margin requirements in an attempt to lower the volatility of common stocks, stock options and the futures market. The New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange introduced the concept of a circuit breaker. The circuit breaker halts trading if the Dow declines a prescribed number of points for a prescribed amount of time. In February 2012, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) introduced single-stock circuit breakers.\n\nTobias Preis and his colleagues Helen Susannah Moat and H. Eugene Stanley introduced a method to identify online precursors for stock market moves, using trading strategies based on search volume data provided by Google Trends. Their analysis of Google search volume for 98 terms of varying financial relevance suggests that increases in search volume for financially relevant search terms tend to precede large losses in financial markets.\n\nThe movements of the prices in a market or section of a market are captured in price indices called stock market indices, of which there are many, e.g., the S&P, the FTSE and the Euronext indices. Such indices are usually market capitalization weighted, with the weights reflecting the contribution of the stock to the index. The constituents of the index are reviewed frequently to include/exclude stocks in order to reflect the changing business environment.\n\nFinancial innovation has brought many new financial instruments whose pay-offs or values depend on the prices of stocks. Some examples are exchange-traded funds (ETFs), stock index and stock options, equity swaps, single-stock futures, and stock index futures. These last two may be traded on futures exchanges (which are distinct from stock exchanges—their history traces back to commodity futures exchanges), or traded over-the-counter. As all of these products are only \"derived\" from stocks, they are sometimes considered to be traded in a (hypothetical) derivatives market, rather than the (hypothetical) stock market.\n\nStock that a trader does not actually own may be traded using short selling; margin buying may be used to purchase stock with borrowed funds; or, \"derivatives\" may be used to control large blocks of stocks for a much smaller amount of money than would be required by outright purchase or sales.\n\nIn short selling, the trader borrows stock (usually from his brokerage which holds its clients' shares or its own shares on account to lend to short sellers) then sells it on the market, betting that the price will fall. The trader eventually buys back the stock, making money if the price fell in the meantime and losing money if it rose. Exiting a short position by buying back the stock is called \"covering.\" This strategy may also be used by unscrupulous traders in illiquid or thinly traded markets to artificially lower the price of a stock. Hence most markets either prevent short selling or place restrictions on when and how a short sale can occur. The practice of naked shorting is illegal in most (but not all) stock markets.\n\nIn margin buying, the trader borrows money (at interest) to buy a stock and hopes for it to rise. Most industrialized countries have regulations that require that if the borrowing is based on collateral from other stocks the trader owns outright, it can be a maximum of a certain percentage of those other stocks' value. In the United States, the margin requirements have been 50% for many years (that is, if you want to make a $1000 investment, you need to put up $500, and there is often a maintenance margin below the $500).\n\nA margin call is made if the total value of the investor's account cannot support the loss of the trade. (Upon a decline in the value of the margined securities additional funds may be required to maintain the account's equity, and with or without notice the margined security or any others within the account may be sold by the brokerage to protect its loan position. The investor is responsible for any shortfall following such forced sales.)\n\nRegulation of margin requirements (by the Federal Reserve) was implemented after the Crash of 1929. Before that, speculators typically only needed to put up as little as 10 percent (or even less) of the total investment represented by the stocks purchased. Other rules may include the prohibition of \"free-riding:\" putting in an order to buy stocks without paying initially (there is normally a three-day grace period for delivery of the stock), but then selling them (before the three-days are up) and using part of the proceeds to make the original payment (assuming that the value of the stocks has not declined in the interim).\n\nGlobal issuance of equity and equity-related instruments totaled $505 billion in 2004, a 29.8% increase over the $389 billion raised in 2003. Initial public offerings (IPOs) by US issuers increased 221% with 233 offerings that raised $45 billion, and IPOs in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) increased by 333%, from $9 billion to $39 billion.\n\nThere are many different approaches to investing. Many strategies can be classified as either fundamental analysis or technical analysis. Fundamental analysis refers to analyzing companies by their financial statements found in SEC filings, business trends, general economic conditions, etc. Technical analysis studies price actions in markets through the use of charts and quantitative techniques to attempt to forecast price trends regardless of the company's financial prospects. One example of a technical strategy is the Trend following method, used by John W. Henry and Ed Seykota, which uses price patterns and is also rooted in risk control and diversification.\n\nAdditionally, many choose to invest via the index method. In this method, one holds a weighted or unweighted portfolio consisting of the entire stock market or some segment of the stock market (such as the S&P 500 or Wilshire 5000). The principal aim of this strategy is to maximize diversification, minimize taxes from too frequent trading, and ride the general trend of the stock market (which, in the U.S., has averaged nearly 10% per year, compounded annually, since World War II).\n\nResponsible investment emphasizes and requires a long term horizon on the basis of fundamental analysis only, avoiding hazards in the expected return of the investment; socially responsible investing is also recommended in all types of investment.\n\nAccording to much national or state legislation, a large array of fiscal obligations are taxed for capital gains. Taxes are charged by the state over the transactions, dividends and capital gains on the stock market, in particular in the stock exchanges. These fiscal obligations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Some countries avoid taxing profits on stocks as the profits are already taxed when companies file returns, but double taxation is common at some level in many countries.\n\n\n\n"}

All employees working in the store report to the retail/store manager. A store manager reports to a district/area or general manager.\n\nResponsibilities of a store manager include:\n\n\nA store manager must meet the monthly, quarterly, or annual sales goals, depending on the company's fiscal cycle. This involves setting individual sales goals (quotas), holding contests for employees, or offering sales promotions. The manager may also find ways to make employees more productive to meet the goals. Thus, the store manager may be forced to reduce payroll expenditures by decreasing employees' hours, or otherwise reducing operating cost. A store manager should motivate his or her team to achieve the target set for the store. A store manager should set an example for his or her subordinates to follow.\n\nThe Store manager is the store's primary key-holder and may be called to the store before, during, or after business hours in the event of an emergency. They are also responsible for the safety of all customers and employees on store premises. Store managers may be required to hold safety meetings, especially as dictated by union practices in cases where store employees belong to a union.\n\nA store manager may have several subordinates who have management-level responsibility. These employees may be called deputy managers, assistant managers, department managers, supervisors, key holders, shift leads, or leads. Sometimes members of the management team may be several grades below the store manager. One example would be store manager - deputy manager - department manager - department leads.\nA store manager has over-all responsibility for all day-to-day activity of the store. Managing & controlling staff, and planning are essential points of the store manager.\n\nThe store manager is responsible for hiring, training, and in some cases, development of employees. The manager must ensure staffing levels are adequate to effectively operate the store, and ensure employees receive training necessary for their job responsibilities. Managers may be responsible for developing employees so the company can promote employees from within and develop future leaders, potentially for employment at other locations. Store managers also have the fire powers to any under-performing or misbehaving employees. The role of store managers with regards to the other employees varies from company to company and each respective company's operating methods but in general a store manager will be required to deal with and try to solve any and all problems that may occur at any given time.\n\n"}
{"id": "2684620", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2684620", "title": "The Bridge World", "text": "The Bridge World\n\nThe Bridge World (TBW), the oldest continuously published magazine about contract bridge, was founded in 1929 by Ely Culbertson. It has since been regarded as the game's principal journal, publicizing technical advances in bidding and the play of the cards, discussions of ethical issues, bridge politics and leading personalities, and reports of major tournaments.\n\nCulbertson edited TBW (assisted by a staff of well known writers and players such as Josephine Culbertson, Alfred Sheinwold, Samuel Fry Jr., Richard L. Frey, Albert H. Morehead and Alphonse \"Sonny\" Moyse Jr.) until 1943. Morehead then became editor and continued until 1946, when Moyse took over. The McCall Corporation purchased TBW in 1963, and subsequently sold it to Edgar Kaplan. Kaplan became editor and publisher in late 1966; his first issue is dated January 1967. Jeff Rubens acted as Kaplan's co-editor until Kaplan's death in 1997, when Rubens became editor and publisher.\n\nLargely because of its emphasis on IMP and matchpoint play, TBW is of interest primarily to tournament players.\n\nSeveral features appear in each issue. The most popular are:\n\nPrior to 1967, editorials had appeared infrequently in TBW. Under the Kaplan/Rubens editorship, the Editorial became a monthly feature, and occupies a privileged position, appearing directly after the table of contents.\n\nThe Editorial usually discusses issues that are both timely and of import to tournament bridge players, and from time to time provides a forum for points of view that are not shared by the editorial staff. A non-random sample of the topics that have appeared in the Editorial over the past 40 years:\n\n\nThe MSC is a combination of quiz and commentary. Several problem hands, along with the bidding so far on each, are presented and the reader is asked what call he would make (the number of problems per month has varied, but since the 1950s at least it has settled in at eight per issue). The answers to each question are given in the next issue, along with comments by expert panelists and by the panel's moderator.\n\nThis arrangement provides a means for the reader to improve his bidding skills, and to get a glimpse of the thought processes of the experts. Readers (or, in the context of the MSC, \"solvers\") are invited to submit their monthly scores to TBW. An annual competition is held for the highest 12-month total; the winner is invited to participate on the expert panel for a year.\n\nFor many years, the MSC was conducted by the same person each month: Samuel Fry Jr. from 1932 through 1945 and Albert H. Morehead from 1945 until his death in 1966. In January 1967, when Kaplan and Rubens took over TBW's editorship, a rotating group of directors was established: Moyse, Alfred Sheinwold, Howard Schenken and Alan Truscott each directed the Club once every four months. Retirements, editorial disagreements and health problems led to changes in the Club's directorship, and well known players such as Bobby Wolff, Jeff Rubens, Eric Kokish, Kit Woolsey, David Berkowitz, Larry Cohen, Bart Bramley, Danny Kleinman, Steve Landen, Karen McCallum, and Barry Rigal have all served as directors. In 2005, the MSC changed from a rotation of four directors to a rotation of six.\n\nThe form of the MSC has also changed markedly over the years. It was originally conceived as a means by which readers could test themselves on the Culbertson System, and for years it was held that there was only one correct answer to each problem – there being only one correct answer in the context of the Culbertson System. In the 1940s a system of partial credits was instituted, with the \"correct\" answer receiving 100 points and lesser awards going to other answers. This approach continues in 2009.\n\nA related change occurred in 1951, when the answers provided by experts other than the director were printed, along with their comments. According to TBW's history of the MSC, this was the magazine's first explicit acknowledgment that such a panel existed. The publication of expert comments also continues in 2009.\n\nAlthough most of the monthly problems concern bidding, under the Kaplan/Rubens editorship there has been one problem each month concerning leads, nearly always opening leads.\n\nAs to the problems that concern bidding, the experts' answers and comments lost clarity as the Culbertson/Goren consensus (four-card majors, strong notrump, strong two-bids, two-over-one showing only about 10 HCP) began to fall apart during the 1950s and 1960s. The experts' answers became influenced less by judgment and more by system, some experts even abstaining on occasion because they could not use a favored treatment. When different experts preferred different systems it became difficult to reach consensus and the comments became less valuable.\n\nTherefore, in 1967 Kaplan and Rubens instituted a poll of experts to determine their bidding preferences (e.g., four-card or five-card majors, strong or weak two-bids, doubles of overcalls negative or for penalty, limit or forcing jump raises, etc.). Solvers were also invited to participate in the poll, but their role was restricted to breaking ties among the experts. The result was Bridge World Standard 1968, now known as BWS 68. There have been three major revisions of the system, in 1984, 1994 and 2001. BWS has always been intended as a platform for answering MSC problems, but also as a system that two experienced players could use if they had never partnered one another. Another use for BWS, perhaps intended in 1967 but never touted as a rationale, is to provide a means of tracking how expert preferences have changed over the years.\n\nTBW regards the MSC as its most successful feature; certainly it is its longest running. It has been imitated in one guise or another by most bridge periodicals.\n\nSeveral sample MSC problems, answers and commentary can be found at TBW's web site.\n\nChallenge the Champs (CTC) is, in the words of TBW, \"… a continuing bidding battle. Each month, two leading pairs compete, bidding deals from actual play (taken from old tournament reports or submitted by readers).\" CTC is a feature that debuted in The Bridge Journal, a periodical edited by Jeff Rubens which was discontinued when Rubens joined the staff of TBW. At that point TBW took over the operation and the publication of CTC.\n\nThe format is to give each pair ten hands to bid, just as though they were at the table. Awards for different contracts are pre-set, and the results are scored as though they were matchpoints awarded on a 12 top. Over ten hands (again quoting from TBW): \"… in the fifties is over average, in the sixties might win, higher is phenomenal.\"\n\nIn its original form, a pair would continue in CTC so long as it kept winning. The prior month's winners were termed the \"Champs\" and would compete against a new pair, the \"Challengers.\" More recently the contest has been altered: TBW invites a pair to participate for exactly two consecutive months (first as Newcomers, then as Incumbents); if a pair wins at least one of its two matches, it is invited to return at a later time, and possibly take part in a CTC elimination tournament.\n\nDuring the period that a pair could compete indefinitely, Matt Granovetter and Ron Rubin established the record for consecutive wins at 10, from July 1975 through April 1976, using the Ultimate Club, a strong club system with many relay sequences. In May 1976 Granovetter-Rubin lost to Kerri and Mike Shuman by the record combined score of 86-85.\n\nCTC has been involved with some odd coincidences. As reported by John Kelly Karasek in a 1978 issue, the March 1975 issue both reported on the Facchini-Zucchelli foot-tapping incident in that year's Bermuda Bowl, \"and\" featured Facchini-Zucchelli as the Challengers in CTC. The May 1977 issue reported at length on a cheating scandal in the US international team trials in Houston Texas, during which the accused, Richard Katz and Larry Cohen (not the same Larry Cohen who has written extensively on the Law of Total Tricks), resigned from the ACBL. Katz and Cohen were the CTC Challengers during that same month.\n\nBits and Pieces is principally a letters-to-the-editor column. It first appeared in January 1955. The very first letter printed in the column asked the correct play in a contract of 4, and the answer was to take an Ann Gallagher finesse.\n\nThe letters tend \"not\" to concern questions of bidding or play – these are dealt with in other features such as Pro et Contra (discontinued after Oswald Jacoby's death in 1984). They \"do\" tend to focus on issues raised in editorials, editorial style (e.g., matters such as gender-neutral prose, and the use of hyphens), unusual occurrences, laws and proprieties, and how sponsoring organizations such as the ACBL and the EBL regulate the game. The column also contains corrections and amplifications, book and product reviews, and occasional solicitations of readers' opinions.\n\n\nSome features that do not appear according to a fixed schedule, or that have run their course:\n\n\nThe concept for a Bridge Hall of Fame was originated with Lee Hazen, an early Life Master, and undertaken by The Bridge World magazine by a ballet poll of 115 leading bridge columnists in the United States; the top three names receiving at least thirty percent of the cast votes were elected in the inaugural year. The magazine continued with elections in 1965 and 1966 but then discontinued sponsorship. The elected members to the Bridge World's Hall of Fame were:\n\nSubsequently in 1995, the American Contract Bridge League inaugurated their own Hall of Fame and adopted the initial nine inducted in the Bridge World Hall of Fame.\n\nSince 1968, the magazine has periodically polled experts on various bidding treatments and conventions in order to develop a unified system of bidding known as Bridge World Standard. There have been five versions of the system with the latest revision being the 2017 edition.\n\nBridge World Standard has evolved with the practices of North American experts and, similar to the Standard American Yellow Card system promulgated by the American Contract Bridge League, is offered as a system \"for use by impromptu or casual partnerships, and as a basis for discussion by those who wish to formulate their own system.\"\n\n"}

After Navy service (as a corpsman, 2nd Marine Division) Spaeth learned market research and account management at Foote Cone & Belding (now Draftfcb), then joined the Harvard Business School class of 1963.\n\nIn 1964, Spaeth was recruited by Lippincott & Margulies (now Lippincott), where “Corporate Identity” was first being thought through as a meaningful professional specialization. From that point on, “identity” became his primary window on marketing and management issues.\n\nTwo decades of diverse marketing work followed, including classic product management (at American Home Foods, on Jiffy Pop and Gulden's brands)… the creation of Controlled Brand Marketing Inc., in partnership with industrial designer Robert P. Gersin, to be product managers/designers for supermarket private labels… consultancy on N.W. Ayer & Son’s marketing services team (including a key role in creation of the Absolut Vodka brand)… VP Marketing of the Levolor blinds company… and then marketing direction of several Citicorp business units.\n\nSpaeth returned to undiluted identity focus in 1985, when he joined the consulting firm Anspach Grossman Portugal (whose partners he had known from Lippincott & Margulies in the 60s) as director of marketing and a consulting principal. His first act was to change the firm’s descriptive tag from “Marketing Communications and Design” to “Identity Consultants,” thus naming the category in which the firm held a leadership position. Clients he served included American Express and Pfizer. He also restructured and directed the firm’s naming capability. In 1990, when AGP’s partners had sold the firm to WPP Group, Spaeth established an independent consultancy.\n\nFrom a base in Rye, New York, since 1990 Spaeth has provided identity planning and creative counsel to scores of clients in diverse categories.

Atwood (January 1, 1839 – December 21, 1910) was a lumber baron in Saginaw, Michigan. Born a slave in Alabama, he was freed in 1853 in the will of his white master and father, and moved to the free state of Ohio. He became active in the Underground Railroad in Ripley, Ohio. During the American Civil War, Atwood moved to the northwest, settling in East Saginaw, Michigan in 1863. There he became successful in real estate and lumber dealing.\n\nAtwood opened a sawmill in 1874. Through his real estate and mills, he became one of the richest African Americans in Michigan. He was active in the Republican party, and served as a delegate to the 1888 Republican National Convention.\n\nWilliam Quincy Atwood was born a slave January 1, 1839 on the Shell Creek plantation in Wilcox County, Alabama near Prairie Bluff. His white father and master was Henry Styles Atwood, born March 26, 1798. His enslaved mother was born on the Maryland Eastern Shore and reared as a slave in Philadelphia and Alabama. William had a number of brothers, including Julius, John S. David, Olive, and Kossuth. Henry Atwood died in 1853 and freed his slaves in his will.\n\nAs a result, William and twenty-one other persons went north, settling in Ripley, Ohio, where he attended a colored school. From 1856 to 1859 he went to Iberia school and later attended Berea College. In the fall of 1859 he went with his brother, John, to California. In California, he worked on steamboats, opened a restaurant, and did some gold mining. John returned to Ohio first, followed by William in the fall of 1861. Ripley was on the Ohio River opposite Maysville, Kentucky, a slave state. Atwood may have been involved in the Underground Railroad active in the area.\n\nIn the spring of 1862, Atwood visited East Saginaw, Michigan, returning to Ripley in the fall. The ongoing American Civil War (1861-1865) made life difficult for a young African-American man who was not a soldier. In the summer of 1863, he returned to East Saginaw where he began land speculating. That year he bought and then sold sixteen hundred acres of land, profiting $4,000 on the deal. This was the start of his success in real estate in Michigan.\n\nIn winter 1868 Atwood began working in lumber, making a profit of $6,000 in the following year. He continued to cut one to five million feet of lumber until 1877. He opened a sawmill along the Saginaw River in 1874. He took a short amount of time off, but lumbered in 1880-1882, 1885, and 1886. He marketed his lumber widely, selling wood in Toledo, Cleveland, Dayton, Cincinnati, Columbus, Chicago, Boston, Baltimore, and elsewhere. He was the only black member of the Saginaw Board of Trade. Atwood may have played a role in preventing Saginaw African Americans from joining the Knights of Labor, especially in 1885 when lumber workers in the area struck. In the 1893 Saginaw fire, Atwood lost two houses.\n\nAtwood was active in a number of civic and political activities. In 1866, Atwood was the treasurer of the East Saginaw Colored Debating Society. In May 1871, he was a supporter of the new library of the Young Men's Christian Association of East Saginaw. In 1884, Atwood was elected at the Colored Men's State Convention to attend the National Colored Convention at Richmond, Virginia. In September 1886 he was a city ambassador to Grand Rapids.\n\nHe was frequently involved in Emancipation Day activities. He was a lifelong Republican and in 1884 was nominated to be delegate-at-large from Michigan to the Republican National Convention. But, only one black man was to be selected and the honor went to Detroit city councilman Samuel C. Watson. and was the first president of the Michigan Protective League formed in 1888. With the support of the league, Atwood campaigned for presidential candidate William Henry Harrison and served as a Michigan delegate-at-large at the 1888 Republican National Convention in Chicago. The next year, the league put Atwood's name forward for the post of Washington, DC Recorder of Deeds. In 1890, Atwood was again a delegate at a national convention of colored men meeting, this time, in Washington, DC and in 1895 in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nHe married Charlotte Echols in Cleveland, Ohio on May 15, 1872. Charlotte was born in Wilkes County, Georgia and was a schoolteacher. They had five children, Willie, Freddie Stiles, Oliver Kossuth, Alice May, and Lottie. Charlotte died in 1895.\n\nAtwood died December 21, 1910 in at St. Mary's hospital in Saginaw of congestion of the lungs. He was buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery in Saginaw.\n\n"}
