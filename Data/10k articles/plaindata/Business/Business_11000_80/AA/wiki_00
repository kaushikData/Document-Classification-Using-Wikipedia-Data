Her father was a farmer. She graduated from Wroclaw University with a M.A. in Art History. She left Poland in 1968, with $100 in her possession.\n\nPiasecka was hired as a cook by Esther Underwood Johnson, then wife of John Seward Johnson I. She then worked as the Johnsons' chambermaid.\n\nOne time seeing his admiration for one of the paintings he had bought, she said casually that he overpaid for it because it is not a picture of a master, but his disciple and by using the dates proved it. Johnson was shocked about her knowledge and expertise, and appointed her as consultant to his purchases of works of art. A year after she became Johnson's chambermaid, she became his curator for the Seward Johnson's art collection.\n\nDuring this time J. Seward Johnson' engaged in extramarital affairs with Piasecka Johnson. In 1971, they married with none of Johnson's children in attendance. According to trial witnesses brought to court by J. S. Johnson's children during the proceedings concerning his will, Piasecka Johnson \"often physically and emotionally abused her husband\".

Excluded from their father's will, Seward Johnson's six children sued on grounds that their father wasn't mentally competent at the time he signed the will. The case went to trial but was settled prior to return of a verdict, and the children were granted about 12% of the fortune, leaving Piasecka Johnson in control of the majority of the estate.\n\nIn 2007, Johnson was listed on the Forbes 400 World's Richest People list with an estimated net worth of $2.7 billion, making her the 149th richest person. She converted the family estate in Princeton, New Jersey, named Jasna Polana, into a country club.\n\nJohnson was involved in a number of charitable projects, especially in Poland, through the Barbara Piasecka Johnson Foundation which she established in 1974.

Founded as the Institute for Public Relations in 1948, CIPR was awarded Chartered status by the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in 2005 and added \"Chartered\" to its name. As of late 2012, CIPR had 10,095 members. The association provides training and education, publishes a code of conduct and hosts awards and events. It is governed by a Board of Directors led by a President who is elected each year.\n\nDiscussions at the first Public Relations Officers conference in November 1946 led to the foundation of the Institute of Public Relations (IPR) in February 1948. It established a Professional Practices committee in 1956 and incorporated in 1962. The Institute of Public Relations first discussed attaining chartered status, a professional recognition in the United Kingdom, with the Privy Council in 1956. The Privy Council said that in order to be awarded chartered status, the organisation would have \"adopt and publish professional ethical standards relevant to the practice of public relations and to maintain procedures for the regulation of members' professional conduct and discipline.\" The Institute's first code of conduct was published seven years later in 1963. As of 2003 few members have been expelled for breaches in the code.\n\nTo support its bid for chartered status, IPR created a joint report with the Department of Trade and Industry in 2003 based on a survey of 812 professionals. The following year the Privy Council told IPR it needed to do more for the public good and professional development to qualify. By 2005, the privy council decided that IPR and its members act in a way that contributes to the public good and granted it chartered status. IPR added \"Chartered\" to its name. An analysis in the \"Journal of Communication Management\" in 2005 said that chartered status was needed in a time where public trust in businesses, institutions and governments was decreasing, but noted CIPR's limited power to enforce ethics among its members.\n\nCIPR changed its membership structure in 2011. Affiliate-level memberships were removed and the requirement for six years of experience to attain full membership status was reduced to two. That same year, CIPR responded to a report by the UK's Intellectual Property Office. CIPR felt that copyright policy decisions were prioritizing commercial interests over the public good. They expressed concern that the Newspaper Licensing Agency (NLA) was both the most popular provider of newspaper clippings to public relations professionals in the UK and the organization that enforces the intellectual property rights of newspapers.\nIn December 2011 the Bureau of Investigative Journalism shot a covert video interview with Bell Pottinger executives, in which the executives referred to their \"dark arts\" for manipulating English Wikipedia entries for their clients. The following month CIPR announced it would work with the Wikipedia community to create guidance for public relations professionals on how to participate ethically on English Wikipedia. CIPR's guidance was made available for editing by the English Wikipedia community and published in June 2012. According to \"PRWeek\" and \"CorpComms Magazine\" the most important aspect of CIPR's guidance is that PR professionals not directly edit English Wikipedia articles about their clients or employers. Instead, CIPR recommends they offer content and suggestions to the English Wikipedia community.\n\nIn 2009 CIPR provided an official response to a report by the Public Administration Select Committee's (PASC) that suggested the creation of a new government entity to oversee and regulate lobbyists. The report suggested the creation of a requirement for lobbyists to register themselves and record their activities. CIPR's position was that regulation would complement CIPR's code of ethics, but that it was more important to regulate members of the House of Lords that were being lobbied to. CIPR also said that lobbying regulation should focus on regulating individuals instead of companies.\n\nIn July 2013, CIPR joined The Public Relations Consultants Association and the Association of Professional Political Consultants in criticizing the UK government's definition of a lobbyist. CIPR's Director of Policy said the definition of lobbying was so narrow it would be \"self-defeating\" because few lobbyists would be defined as one. CIPR and other public relations trade associations support a registrar for lobbyists, though UK government estimates the cost of a registrar to be 500,000 pounds its first year and 200,000 every year thereafter.\n\nIn June 2015 the CIPR launched the UK Lobbying Register to replace the joint voluntary register previously run in conjunction with The Public Relations Consultants Association and the Association of Professional Political Consultants.\n\nThe Chartered Institute of Public Relations is governed by a 50-member Council that meets four times a year and an Executive Board that meets every six weeks. A President is elected each year that is usually supported by their predecessor. CIPR has six membership grades and 15 regional groups. CIPR had approximately 3,900 members in 1999, 7,000 by 2002, and 7,800 by 2004. By the end of 2012, CIPR had 10,095 members. Prior to 1999, applications for membership were processed over six weeks, before being ratified to an immediate acceptance system. CIPR is a member of the European PR Federation and a founding member of the Global Alliance for Public Relations and Communications Management. CIPR membership is bestowed in two categories: Associate CIPR member for new entrants to the field and full membership for those with at least two years of experience. It also has a Government Affairs Group dedicated to lobbyists.\n\nCIPR started hosting training and certification programmes in 1980. By 1998 it awarded 5,000 certificates and 3,000 diplomas. CIPR publishes a code of conduct that encourages members to \"deal honestly and fairly\" with clients, employers, business partners and the public. The code sets standards in personal conduct, integrity and confidentiality. Violations in its code are reported to the Professional Practices Committee, which may pass cases on to the Disciplinary Committee for sanctions.\n\nThe Institute hosts the Excellence Awards and the PRide awards. The Excellence Awards are bestowed in 28 categories based on a scoring of a campaign in four categories: planning, creativity, measurement and evaluation. CIPR maintains a public database of members, information on legislation affecting public relations, case studies, and a career guide.\n\nThe organization also hosts networking, award and educational events. PR professionals don't have to be a member to attend events or training. In 2003, 2,000 non-members attended the organization's training and 7,000 non-members attended events. CIPR has published \"Public Relations\" from 1952 to 1988 and \"IPR Newsletter\" intermittently from 1956 to 1983, as well as other publications. It also publishes a series of books with case studies and tips from CIPR award-winners called the \"PR in practice series.\"\n\n"}

He attended Wesley College, a prestigious Dublin school run by his maternal uncle Gerald Myles. Upon graduating he joined a host of notable alumni such as playwright George Bernard Shaw and Chaim Herzog, the sixth President of Israel.\n\nIn the late 1950s, FitzGerald emerged as a pioneer of scuba diving in Ireland. FitzGerald's work in the fledgling field of underwater photography unveiled and displayed the marine life of the Irish coastline to a wondrous audience. At a time when the Irish authorities had no diving capability, FitzGerald was often summoned to lead dives on behalf of the government.\n\nFitzGerald began his business career as a trainee in a small accounting firm. Following a series of mergers, FitzGerald quickly rose through the ranks and was ultimately appointed the head partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers. In the 1980s, as the Irish economy was experiencing a crippling recession, FitzGerald emerged as a leading insolvency practitioner. His business reputation flourished after a string of successes in rescuing failing businesses. In 1986, FitzGerald was the defendant in a landmark legal case brought by Irish tobacco giant Carroll Group. The court issued judgement in favor of FitzGerald.

M&T techniques provide energy managers with feedback on operating practices, results of energy management projects, and guidance on the level of energy use that is expected in a certain period. Importantly, they also give early warning of unexpected excess consumption caused by equipment malfunctions, operator error, unwanted user behaviours, lack of effective maintenance and the like.\n\nThe foundation of M&T lies in determining the normal relationships of energy consumptions to relevant driving factors (HVAC equipment, production though puts, weather, occupancy available daylight, etc.) and the goal is to help business managers:\n\n\nThe ultimate goal is to reduce energy costs through improved energy efficiency and energy management control. Other benefits generally include increased resource efficiency, improved production budgeting and reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\n\nM&T is an established technique that was first launched as a national program in the UK in 1980, and has since then spread throughout Europe. These techniques are now also rapidly growing in America.\n\nThroughout the numerous M&T projects implemented since the 1980s, a certain number of benefits have proved to be recurrent:\n\nMonitoring and Targeting techniques rely on three main principles, which form a constant feedback cycle, therefore improving control of energy use.\n\nMonitoring information of energy use, in order to establish a basis for energy management and explain deviations from an established pattern. Its primary goal is to maintain said pattern, by providing all the necessary data on energy consumption, as well as certain driving factors, as identified during preliminary investigation (production, weather, etc.)\n\nThe final principle is the one which enables ongoing control of energy use, achievement of targets and verification of savings: reports must be issued to the appropriate managers. This in turn allows decision-making and actions to be taken in order to achieve the targets, as well as confirmation or denial that the targets have been reached.\n\nBefore the M&T measures themselves are implemented, a few preparatory steps are necessary. First of all, key energy consumers on the site must be identified. Generally, most of the energy consumption is concentrated in a small number of processes, like heating, or certain machinery. This normally requires a certain survey of the building and the equipment to estimate their energy consumption level.\n\nIt is also necessary to assess what other measurements will be required to analyze the consumption appropriately. This data will be used to chart against the energy consumption: these are underlying factors which influence the consumption, often production (for industry processes) or exterior temperature (for heating processes), but may include many other variables.\n\nOnce all variables to be measured have been established, and the necessary meters installed, it is possible to initiate the M&T procedures.\n\nThe first step is to compile the data from the different meters. Low-cost energy feedback displays have become available. The frequency at which the data is compiled varies according to the desired reporting interval, but can go once every 30 seconds to once every 15 minutes. Some measurements can be taken directly from the meters, others must be calculated. These different measurements are often called streams or channels.\n\nDriving factors such as production or degree days also constitute streams and must be collected at intervals to match.\n\nThe data compiled must then be plotted on a graph in order to define the general consumption base-line. Consumption rates are plotted in a scatter plot against production or any other variable previously identified, and the best fit line is identified. This graph is the image of the business’ average energy performance, and conveys a lot of information:\n\nThe slope is not used quite as often for M&T purposes. However, a high y-intercept can mean that there is a fault in the process, causing it to use too much energy with no performance, unless there are specific distinctive features which lead to high base loads. Very scattered points, on the other hand, may reflect other significant factors playing in the variation of the energy consumption, other than the one plotted in the first place, but it can also be the illustration of a lack of control over the process.\n\nThe next step is to monitor the difference between the expected consumption and the actual measured consumption. One of the tools most commonly used for this is the CUSUM, which is the CUmulative SUM of differences. This consists in first calculating the difference between the expected and actual performances (the best fit line previously identified and the points themselves).\n\nThe CUSUM can then be plotted against time on a new graph, which then yields more information for the energy efficiency specialist. Variances scattered around zero usually mean that the process is operating normally. Marked variations, increasing or decreasing steadily usually reflect a modification in the conditions of the process.\n\nIn the case of the CUSUM graph, the slope becomes very important, as it is the main indicator of the savings achieved. A slope going steadily down indicates steady savings. Any variation in the slope indicates a change in the process. For example, in the graph on the right, the first section indicated no savings. However, in September (beginning of the yellow line), an energy efficiency measure must have been implemented, as savings start to occur. The green line indicates an increase in the savings (as the slope is becoming steeper), whereas the red line must reflect a modification in the process having occurred in November, as savings have decreased slightly.\n\nEnergy efficiency specialists, in collaboration with building managers, will decipher the CUSUM graph and identify the causes leading to variations in the consumption. This can be a change in behaviour, a modification to the process, different exterior conditions, etc. These changes must be monitored and the causes identified in order to promote and enhance good behaviour, and discourage bad ones.\n\nOnce the base line has been established, and causes for variations in energy consumption have been identified, it is time to set targets for the future. Now with all this information in hand, the targets are more realistic, as they are based on the building’s actual consumption.\nTargeting consists in two main parts: the measure to which the consumption can be reduced, and the timeframe during which the compression will be achieved.\n\nA good initial target is the best fit line identified during step 2. This line represents the average historical performance. Therefore, keeping all consumption below or equal to the historical average is an achievable target, yet remains a challenge as it involves eliminating high consumption peaks.\n\nSome companies, as they improve their energy consumption, might even decide to bring their average performance down to their historical best. This is considered a much more challenging target.\n\nThis brings us back to step 1: measure consumption. One of the specificities of M&T is that it is an ongoing process, requiring constant feedback in order to consistently improve performance. Once the targets are set and the desired measures are implemented, repeating the procedure from the start ensures that the managers are aware of the success or failure of the measures, and can then decide on further action.\n\nAn example with some features of an M&T application is the ASU Campus Metabolism, which provides real-time and historic energy use and generation data for facilities of Arizona State University on a public web site.

EY is one of the largest professional services firms in the world and is one of the \"Big Four\" accounting firms.\n\nEY operates as a network of member firms which are separate legal entities in individual countries. It has 250,000 employees in over 700 offices around 150 countries in the world. It provides assurance (including financial audit), tax, consulting and advisory services to companies.\n\nThe firm dates back to 1849 with the founding of Harding & Pullein in England. The current firm was formed by a merger of Ernst & Whinney and Arthur Young & Co. in 1989. It was known as Ernst & Young until 2013 when it underwent a rebranding to EY. The acronym \"EY\" was already an informal name for the firm prior to its official adoption.\n\nIn 2018, \"Fortune\" magazine ranked EY 52nd on the 100 Best Companies to Work For list. In 2017, EY was the 9th largest privately owned organization in the United States.\n\nEY is the result of a series of mergers of ancestor organizations. The oldest originating partnership was founded in 1849 in England as Harding & Pullein. In that year the firm was joined by Frederick Whinney. He was made a partner in 1859 and with his sons in the business, it was renamed Whinney Smith & Whinney in 1894.\n\nIn 1903, the firm of Ernst & Ernst was established in Cleveland by Alwin C. Ernst and his brother Theodore and in 1906, Arthur Young & Co. was set up by the Scotsman Arthur Young in Chicago.\n\nAs early as 1924, these American firms allied with prominent British firms, Young with Broads Paterson & Co. and Ernst with Whinney Smith & Whinney. In 1979, this led to the formation of Anglo-American Ernst & Whinney, creating the fourth largest accountancy firm in the world. Also in 1979, the European offices of Arthur Young merged with several large local European firms, which became member firms of Arthur Young International.\n\nIn 1989, the number four firm Ernst & Whinney merged with the then number five, Arthur Young, on a global basis to create Ernst & Young.\n\nIn October 1997, EY announced plans to merge its global practices with KPMG to create the largest professional services organization in the world, coming on the heels of another merger plan announced in September 1997 by Price Waterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand. These plans were abandoned in February 1998 due to client opposition, antitrust issues, cost problems and difficulty of merging the two diverse firms and cultures.\n\nEY had built up its consulting arm heavily during the 1980s and 1990s. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and members of the investment community began to raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest between the consulting and auditing work amongst the Big Five and in May 2000, EY was the first of the firms to formally and fully separate its consulting practices via a sale to the French IT services company Capgemini for $11 billion, largely in stock, creating the new company of Capgemini Ernst & Young, which was later renamed Capgemini.\n\nIn 2002, EY took over many of the ex-Arthur Andersen practices around the world, although not those in the United Kingdom, China, or the Netherlands.\n\nIn 2006, EY became the only member of the Big Four to have two member firms in the United States, with the inclusion of Mitchell & Titus, LLP, the largest minority-owned accounting firm in the United States.\n\nIn April 2009, Reuters reported that EY launched an initiative encouraging its staff in China to take 40 days of low-pay leave between July 2009 and June 2010 due to the economic turndown. Those who participated got 20% of regular salary plus benefits of a full-time employee. The initiative applied to employees in Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China, where the firm's employees are 8,500 in total.\n\nIn 2010, EY acquired Terco, the Brazilian member firm of Grant Thornton.\n\nIn 2013, EY agreed to pay federal prosecutors $123 million to settle criminal tax avoidance charges stemming from $2 billion in unpaid taxes from about 200 wealthy individuals advised by four Ernst & Young senior partners between 1999 and 2004.\n\nIn 2013, EY changed its brand name from Ernst & Young to EY and tagline to \"Building a better working world\".\n\nIn 2013, the Pope of the Roman Catholic church hired EY to help review Vatican City State's finances and help “verify and consult” the institution’s administration, including the museums, post office and tax-free department store. EY expanded further and acquired all of KPMG Denmark's operations including its 150 partners, 1500 employees and 21 offices.\n\nIn 2015, EY opened its first ever global Security Operations Centre at Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala in India and will invest $20 million over 5 years to combat increasing threat of cybercrimes.\n\nIn 2016 EY audited 947 public companies which are registered with the US SEC, more than any other auditing firm.\n\nIn 2017 EY announced it was opening an executive support center in Tucson, Arizona, creating over 125 new jobs. In 2017 the company began looking for a location for a new, $4.35 million professional services center in Louisville, Kentucky, creating 125 new jobs, due to open in mid-2018.\n\nIn 2018 EY announced it was opening an IT 'Tech' Hub in Nashville, Tennessee, creating 600 new jobs for the region.\n\nEY is the most globally managed of the Big Four firms. EY Global sets global standards and oversees global policy and consistency of service, with client work performed by its member firms.\n\nEach EY member country is organized as part of one of four areas. This is different from other professional services networks, which are more centrally managed.\n\nThe four areas are:\nEach area has an identical business structure and a management team, which is led by an Area Managing Partner who is part of the Global Executive board.\n\nIn India, since ICAI regulations do not permit foreign firms to carry out company audits, Ernst and Young carries them out through \"SR Batliboi & Co\", an accountancy firm headquartered in Mumbai. They carry out audits for large companies such as Vedanta Limited and V-Guard under partnerships called S.R.Batliboi & Co LLP and S.R.Batliboi & Co Associates.\n\nEY has the following four main service lines:\n\n\nThe rebranded EY logo was unveiled in July 2013 to coincide with the firm changing its trading name from Ernst & Young to EY.\n\nErnst & Young has been in accounting scandals - Bank of Credit and Commerce International (1991), Informix Corporation (1996), Sybase (1997), Cendant (1998), One.Tel (2001), AOL (2002), HealthSouth Corporation (2003), Chiquita Brands International (2004), Lehman Brothers (2010), Sino-Forest Corporation (2011) and Olympus Corporation (2011).\n\nIn 2004, Ernst & Young was punished for forming highly profitable business with one of its audit clients, PeopleSoft. As a result, the firm was barred by the SEC from accepting any new publicly traded companies as audit clients for six months.\nIn April 2004, Equitable Life, a UK life assurance company, sued EY after nearly collapsing but abandoned the case in September 2005. EY described the case as \"a scandalous waste of time, money and resources for all concerned.\"\n\nFollowing allegations by the Securities and Exchange Commission that EY had committed accounting fraud in its work auditing the books of Bally Total Fitness, EY reached two settlements in 2008, including a fine of $8.5 million.\n\nIn 2009, in the Anglo Irish Bank hidden loans controversy, EY was criticised by politicians and the shareholders of Anglo Irish Bank for failing to detect large loans to Sean FitzPatrick, its chairman, during its audits. The Irish Government had to subsequently take full ownership of the Bank at a cost of €28 billion. The Irish Chartered Accountants Regulatory Board appointed John Purcell to investigate. EY said it \"fundamentally disagrees with the decision to initiate a formal disciplinary process\" and that \"there has been no adverse finding made against EY in respect of the audit of Anglo Irish Bank.\"\n\nIn 2009, EY, the former auditors of Sons of Gwalia, agreed to a $125m settlement over their role in the gold miner’s collapse in 2004. Ferrier Hodgson, the company's administrator, had claimed EY was negligent over the accounting of gold and dollar hedging contracts. However, EY said that the proposed settlement was not an admission of any liability.\n\nIn 2009, EY agreed to pay US$200m out of court to settle a negligence claim by the liquidators of Akai Holdings. Separately the firm was alleged of falsifying and doctoring documents it presented to defend against the negligence claim by Akai's liquidators. In a separate lawsuit, a former EY senior partner from 1984 to 1991, Cristopher Ho, and his listed company, Grande Holdings, paid over US$100m to Akai creditors to settle Akai's liquidators' claim that Ho conspired with Ting of stripping assets from Akai. Police raided the Hong Kong office and arrested an EY partner who had been an audit manager on the Akai account from December 1997, although audit documents had been doctored dating back to 1994. Akai was said to be the firm's largest client for most of the 1990s from Hong Kong.\nThe EY partner for the Akai account between 1991 and 1999, David Sun Tak-kei, faced no charges and went on to become co-managing partner for EY China. A few months later EY settled a similar claim of up to HK$300m from the liquidators of Moulin Global Eyecare, an audit client of the Hong Kong affiliate between 2002 and 2004. The liquidators described the Moulin accounts as a \"morass of dodginess\".\n\nThe Valukas Report issued in 2010 charged that Lehman Brothers engaged in a practice known as repo 105 and that EY, Lehman's auditor, was aware of it. EY was alleged of professional malpractice regarding the lack of disclosure of Lehman's repo 105 practice in Lehman's public filings. New York prosecutors announced in 2010 that they have sued the firm. David Goldfarb, a Lehman CFO who concocted the repo 105 balance sheet window dressing technique was a former senior partner of EY. EY said that its last audit of Lehman Brothers was for the fiscal year ending 30 November 2007 and that Lehman’s financial statements were fairly presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. In March 2015, EY settled Lehman-related lawsuits with municipalities in New Jersey and California.\n\nEY Hong Kong resigned from the audit of Standard Water on when it emerged that although EY Hong Kong had signed off the audit, it had been effectively outsourced to the affiliate in mainland China, which had received 99.98% of the fee. This was important because shareholders have less confidence in mainland auditors and because audit papers on the mainland are subject to state secrecy laws and can be withheld from outside regulators. EY's quality and risk management leader (Greater China) even testified in the Court of First Instance that he was not sure whether there was a formal agreement covering the relationship between the two EY entities. The court case in 2013 came as US regulators were taking an interest in similar cases of accounting fraud in mainland China.\n\nIn 2014 tax arrangements negotiated by EY for The Walt Disney Company, Koch Industries, Skype, and other multinational corporations became public in the so-called \"Luxembourg Leaks\". The disclosure of these and other tax arrangements led to controversial discussions about tax avoidance.\n\nIn October 2016, EY settled with the SEC because they were unable to detect financial statement fraud that was committed by the Weatherford tax department. Weatherford misstated their financial statements by manipulating the income tax line item in their financials. EY was Weatherford's independent auditors when the fraud was perpetrated.\n\nEY's member firm in Japan, Ernst & Young ShinNihon, was fined () for failing to spot irregularities during audit of its client Toshiba, which was Japan's worst accounting scandal in years. The firm was also suspended from taking up new business for three months. An official from Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) described that \"[t]here was a grave breach of duty\". The firm's CEO and chairman, Koichi Hanabusa stepped down the following month to take responsibility and monthly salaries for 19 employees were cut from 20 per cent to 50 per cent. In an unusual move, the FSA publicly named seven accountants involved in the audit who were said of failing to exercise due caution and signing off on false financial documents. The FSA also said the \"firm’s operations were deeply improper\". ShinNihon, at the time, was Japan's biggest accounting firm, with about 3,500 certified accountants and more than 4,000 clients. Ernst & Young ShinNihon audited about 960 listed companies in Japan, the most among the Big Four, as reported in 2015. Ernst & Young ShinNihon had audited Toshiba for over 60 years and the firm had around 70 staff serving Toshiba before the accounting scandal broke.\n\nIn October 2016, Mozilla stopped accepting WebTrust audits from Ernst & Young Hong Kong due to their failure \"to detect multiple issues they should have detected\" during their audits of WoSign.\n\nIn February 2017, in response to questions regarding misissued certificates, Symantec stated they would no longer accept WebTrust audits from E&Y Korea and E&Y Brazil due to deficiencies in these audits.\n\nErnst & Young Baltic, member of the EY network, used the emission assumptions of highly polluting EURO II trucks (manufactured before 2001) to falsely increase the socio-economic benefits of the new railway for the period 2026-2055 by 3 billion euros in the Rail Baltica Cost-Benefit Analysis. Total mistakes amount to more than 4 billion euros that constitute 20% of the total socio-economic benefits of the Rail Baltica. Correction of the mistakes makes the project unfeasible. EY has refused to provide any comments to the media regarding the public accusations.\n\nEY's publicity activity includes its \"World Entrepreneur of the Year Award\" program, held in over 60 countries.\n\nEY UK also publicizes itself by sponsoring exhibitions of works by famous artists, such as Cézanne, Picasso, Bonnard, Monet, Rodin and Renoir. The most recent of these was \"Maharaja: the Splendour of India's Royal Courts\" at the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\nIn addition, EY publicizes itself by sponsoring the educational children's show \"Cyberchase\" on PBS Kids under the PBS Kids GO! television brand, in an effort to improve mathematics literacy in children.\n\nEY in the UK sponsors the ITEM club.\n\nEY in the UK has set up the National Equality Standard (NES), an initiative developed for business which sets clear equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) criteria against which companies are assessed. The National Equality Standard (NES) is currently the only industry recognised national standard for EDI in the UK.\n\nEY in the UK has set up \"EY Foundation\", a new UK charity set up to support young people and entrepreneurs.\n\nOn 8 September 2011, Rio 2016 made the announcement that EY would be an official sponsor of the \"XXXI Olympic Summer Games\" to be held in Brazil, as the exclusive provider of professional services – consulting and auditing – for Rio 2016 organizing committee.\n\nEY has also been an Official Partner to The 2012 and the 2014 Ryder Cups.\n\nEY also has a longstanding relationship with the 2011 Tour de France winner Cadel Evans.\n\nEY also partners with the British and Irish Lions.\n\n"}

Its main purpose was centralized preparation of food (both prefabrication and full processing) supplied for communal dining rooms or for personal purchase. Factory-kitchens were characteristic of their unique architecture. Sometimes the term is inadequately translated as communal kitchen, the latter being a kitchen in a Soviet communal apartment.\n\nThe idea of centralized food preparation was part of the emancipation of the women from the household work in early Soviet Union, and to better tap into women's workforce. Along with the house-communes (дом-коммуна), factory-kitchens were to get rid of \"the yoke of the household economy\". Slogans of the day were \"Away with Pots and Pans!\" and \"The Saucepan is an Enemy of the Party Cell.\n\nVarious propagandists explained how \"a single person can prepare from fifty to hundred dinners a day\".

{"id": "4364467", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4364467", "title": "Felix Booth", "text": "Felix Booth\n\nSir Felix Booth, 1st Baronet, FRS (1775 Roydon, Essex – 24 January 1850 Brighton, Sussex) was a wealthy UK gin distiller, and promoter of Arctic exploration, with various places in Nunavut, Canada being named after him.\n\nSir Felix Booth's ancestry can be traced back to the marriage of William de Booth in abt 1250 in Branston Lancashire. Five generations later, Sir John Booth b abt 1350 wed twice, firstly to Lady Joan Trafford in abt 1378 at Barton upon Inwell and secondly to Lady Maude Savage in abt 1412 at Barton upon Inwell Lancashire, collectively producing thirteen children. There was a parting of the ways with their children when their son Thomas Booth (1395–1482) (later knighted) moved from Lancashire to Lincolnshire and married Isabella Carrington in 1431 at Killingholme,and their other son named Robert Booth (b 1384) (later knighted) married Dulcia Venabales on 3 May 1409 at Eccles Lancashire and became the start of the \"Booths of Dunham Massey\" dynasty in Cheshire.\n\nSir Thomas and Isabella Booth née Carrington, now living in Lincolnshire, had seven offspring in Killingholme from which two Booth streams eventuated with their son Thomas Booth marrying Ann Ashton in abt 1456 at Goxhill Lincolnshire and starting the \"Booths of Goxhill\" dynasty, whilst their son Henry Booth married Elizabeth Gascaryk in 1460 at Killingholme Lincolnshire and started the \"Booths of Killingholme\" dynasty. Sir Felix Booth's ancestry has derived from the \"Booths of Killingholme\" dynasty.\n\nFive generations later, John Booth of Killingholme born abt 1555 married Martha Butler in abt 1573 at Goxhill and they had four offspring, from which their son George Booth b 1582 married Elizabeth Monkton in abt 1605 at Killingholme. Their son William Booth b 1608 married Elizabeth Wright on 13 June 1631 at Market Rasen. William and Elizabeth Booth's marriage produced ten offspring, from which their son Thomas Booth b 1637 (who would become Sir Felix Booth's 2x great-grandfather) married Elizabeth Middlemore on 23 November 1670 at Market Rasen, producing four sons and four daughters: their first son John Booth b 1672 (who would become Sir Felix Booth's 1x great-grandfather) marrying Elizabeth Sanderson on 20 June 1700 at Ulceby, their third son Robert Booth b 1677 marrying Katherine Clinton, daughter of Francis Clinton 6th Earl of Lincoln and their fourth son Peniston Booth marrying Katherine Jones, daughter of Reverend Canon Dr Edward Jones.\n\nFrom the marriage of John Booth and Elizabeth Sanderson on 20 June 1700 at Ulceby, their second son William Booth b 1703 married Alice Green on 25 July 1729 at Ulceby and they would have eight children comprising six boys and two girls. It would be their first son Richard Booth b 22 July 1730 who would be Sir Felix Booth's first cousin once removed. Richard married Ann Hill in 1753 at Irby upon Humber near Caistor and lived permanently in the village of Caistor. Richard and Ann had nine children comprising six sons and three daughters and their last born son Samuel Booth b 1773 married Ann (maiden name not known)in abt 1803 and had a son named Felix Booth b 1805. Richard Booth died in 1800 aged 70. It was reported in the Gentleman's Magazine in 1840 that \"the late Richard Booth's daughter Miss Elizabeth Booth of Caistor Lincolnshire died on 22nd April 1840 in her 82nd year. She was a cousin to Sir Felix Booth\".\n\nFrom the marriage of John Booth and Elizabeth Sanderson on 20 June 1700 at Ulceby, their third son John Booth b 1711(who would become Sir Felix Booth's grandfather) made his way to London and became involved in the distillery business, from which a major British company would evolve. John Booth married a Mary (maiden name may possibly be Watts and the marriage date may possibly be 3 January 1739 at Westminster London, but not substantiated) and by 1740, John Booth was aged 29 years and Booth's Gin was very popular. John and Mary produced at least four offspring including their son Philip Booth who was born during 1745 (substantiated by his obituary saying he died on 5 May 1818 aged 73). A second son John Booth was born abt 1750 and reference to him was reported in the Gentleman's Magazine in 1804 when it said \"John Booth's youngest daughter Jane died in her seventeenth year at Caistor Lincolnshire\". She was presumably visiting or staying with her Uncle Richard Booth and Aunt Ann Booth. Nothing is known about the remaining offspring.\n\nAround 1760, Philip Booth joined his father John in the family business and in abt 1772, he married Elisabeth Wallis, whose father lived – as did Philip – in the new and fashionable Russell Square on the Bedford Estate in Bloomsbury London. Philip and Elisabeth produced seven children, comprising four sons and three daughters, Elizabeth abt 1773 + William b 25 July 1774 + John Gillyat b 17 March 1776 + Mary b 15 August 1777 + Philip b 1778 + Felix b 16 July 1780 + Alice b 4 August 1782. In the Directory of Merchants for 1778, when Philip was aged 33, there is the entry of the firm Philip Booth and Company, Distillers, of 55 Turnmill Street in Clerkenwell London. Philip's three sons William, John Gillyat and Felix would join the family business and be groomed as successors. However shortly before Philip's death in 1818, the original family partnership was dissolved and a new one established between the brothers John Gillyat aged 40 and Felix aged 36. Together they had – to a great extent – rebuilt the Turnmill Street premises and it would be Felix who subsequently obtained sole control of the business.\n\nWith energy and drive, Felix expanded the business by building a second distillery at Brentford on the river Thames just six miles from Hyde Park Corner and purchasing the neighbouring brewery of Hazard and Company, which he renamed as the Red Lion Brewery. By establishing a distillery in Edinburgh Scotland, Felix Booth could then boast that he was the owner of the biggest distilling business in England. In 1828, now aged 48, he was elected a Sheriff of the City of London and the County of Middlesex. Felix had now accumulated considerable wealth and decided to use his money to privately fund a voyage of exploration to the Artic Seas, financing Captain Ross and his twenty two companions, equipped with stores and supplies to last several years, on a voyage on the paddle-steamer \"Victory\". They departed Woolwich Reach on 23 May 1829 and returned to Hull Yorkshire on 18 October 1833, having survived many exploratory experiences. Whilst Captain Ross had failed to open up a North-West passage, he had dramatically narrowed the field for future expeditions by mapping an area of over half-million square miles. For Felix Booth's financial contribution to such an effort, he was knighted by the King and had a baronetcy bestowed upon him 'as a reward for his patriotism in fitting out at his sole cost an expedition in the endeavour to discover a North-West Passage'.\nIn 1832, Sir Felix Booth bought the site of the old Ophthalmic Hospital in Albany Street, Regent's Park as a site for his distillery. In 1840, he went into partnership with William Grimble to experiment with producing vinegar from the spirits left over from the manufacturing process. The site was in the NE corner of Cumberland Market. The venture was unsuccessful so Sir Felix reverted to the more conventional method of vinegar brewing.\n\nBetween 1840 and 1843, Sir Felix Booth was faced with a blackmail situation and it was ultimately taken to court in 1843. Sir Felix had a second cousin once removed also named Felix Booth b 1805, being the grandson of Richard Booth of Caistor Lincolnshire. Felix, no doubt envious of Sir Felix's wealth, threatened – with the intent to exhort money – to reveal to the police that Sir Felix had committed unlawful sexual crimes. Sir Felix attended the hearing in Hull Yorkshire, vigorously denying the claims asserted by Felix. Sir Felix admitted to the court that he had fathered a male child with a Scottish woman in Edinburgh that he was very fond of and had financially assisted the child through his growth years. This situation had made Felix insanely jealous. The 'love child' was referred in the court as simply Mr Marr. The court ruled Sir Felix to be innocent and Felix was found guilty of blackmail and sentenced to twenty years transportation to Australia.\n\nWilliam Bradley (1801–1857), one of England's leading painters / engravers of the era painted a portrait of Sir Felix Booth around 1850, coloured in a mettzo-tint style and it was hung in the Court Room of the Coopers Company until its destruction in an air raid over London during World War 2.\n\nSir Felix Booth died unexpectedly of heart failure whilst staying in a seaside hotel at Brighton in 1850, aged 69. His funeral procession was staged with all the solemn pageantry of the Victorian period and passed respectful bare-headed villagers lining the roadside in Edmonton and Hoddesdon. Six horses, preceded by outriders, drew the hearse, six coaches of mourners followed it and Sir Felix's private carriage, empty of passengers, brought up the rear. It was said that \"Sir Felix Booth dies generally and justly lamented. he was in every respect a princely citizen of London. His immense wealth, acquired by his own industry, was devoted to the benefit or enjoyment of others. His disposition was amiable and his habits splendid. He took delight in hospitality and in acts of kindness and charity\".\n\nSir Felix Booth had not married but his illegitimate son John Marshall Marr – mentioned in the 1843 Hull Court hearing as simply Mr Marr – married Emma Minchin on 26 September 1836 at Exeter Devon and they produced eight daughters and four sons, named George b 1837 + William b 1845 + Arthur b 1852 + John b 1855. John Marshall Marr was adequately benefited in the Will of Sir Felix Booth.\n\nAs of 2015, \"Booth's Gin\" remains licensed by Diageo.\n\nFascinated by science, Booth financed John Ross's 1829 expedition to find the Northwest Passage. The Boothia Peninsula and Gulf of Boothia are named after him.\n\nHe provided £17,000 for the expenses of the expedition, to which Captain (\"later\" Sir John) Ross had added £3,000, and the result was an immense stride in the progress of geographical science. The grateful commander bestowed the name of his patron upon several of his discoveries on land and sea – \"Gulf of Boothia\", \"Isthmus of Boothia\", \"Continent of Boothia Felix\", \"Felix Harbor\", \"Cape Felix\", and \"Sheriff's Harbor\": the district with the islands, rivers, lakes, &c., extending to 74° N. latitude along the north-eastern portion of North America.\n\nThe discovery most important to geographical science was that of the magnetic pole at 96° 46' 45\" W. longitude, and 70° 5' 17\".\nHaving served as Alderman and Master of the Worshipful Company of Coopers, Booth was elected a Sheriff of London in 1828.\n\nA founding Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, Booth was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 10 April 1834; his sponsorship of the successful expedition was rewarded by King William IV with a baronetcy, on 27 March 1835, with remainder to heirs male of his eldest brother.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "35304421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35304421", "title": "Jobs (film)", "text": "Jobs (film)\n\nJobs is a 2013 American biographical drama film based on the life of Steve Jobs, from 1974 while a student at Reed College to the introduction of the iPod in 2001. It is directed by Joshua Michael Stern, written by Matt Whiteley, and produced by Stern and Mark Hulme. Steve Jobs is portrayed by Ashton Kutcher, with Josh Gad as Apple Computer's co-founder Steve Wozniak. \"Jobs\" was chosen to close the 2013 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nThe film opens in 2001 with a middle-aged Steve Jobs (Ashton Kutcher) introducing the iPod at an Apple Town Hall meeting.\n\nIt then flashes back to Reed College in 1974. Jobs had already dropped out due to the high expense of tuition, but was still attending classes with the approval of Dean Jack Dudman (James Woods) who took him under his wing. Jobs is particularly interested in a course on calligraphy. He meets up with his friend Daniel Kottke (Lukas Haas) who is excited to see that Jobs is holding a copy of \"Be Here Now\"\" \"by Baba Ram Dass. Influenced by this book and his experiences with LSD, Jobs and Kottke spend time in India.\n\nTwo years later, Jobs is back in Los Altos, California living at home with his adoptive parents Paul (John Getz) and Clara (Lesley Ann Warren). He is working for Atari and develops a partnership with his friend Steve Wozniak (Josh Gad) after he sees that Wozniak has built a personal computer (the Apple I). They name their new company Apple Computer, though there already is a company called Apple Records that is owned by The Beatles (Wozniak then teases Jobs that this is symbolic of his preference for Bob Dylan). Wozniak gives a demonstration of the Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club. Jobs is later approached by Paul Terrell (Brad William Henke) who shows interest in the Apple I. Knowing that he and Wozniak will need a studio in which to build them, Jobs convinces his father Paul to allow them to use the family garage (set up as a carpentry/tool center) for his new company. Realizing that they cannot build these computers alone, Jobs also recruits Kottke, Bill Fernandez (Victor Rasuk), and Chris Espinosa (Eddie Hassell) to the Apple team.\n\nTerrell, however, is disappointed by the Apple I, a reaction which inspires Jobs to start again with a second model. He hires Rod Holt (Ron Eldard) to reconceptualize the power supply for what would be called the Apple II. In addition, after many failed attempts, Jobs finally wins the interest of a venture capitalist, Mike Markkula (Dermot Mulroney), who also joins Apple. They release the Apple II at the 1977 West Coast Computer Faire where it is a remarkable success. Suddenly Jobs and the company are very successful.\n\nThe success also causes Jobs to distance himself from his friends and his high school girlfriend Chrisann Brennan (Ahna O'Reilly). When Brennan tells him she is pregnant with their child, he promptly ends their relationship. Brennan eventually gives birth to Lisa Brennan whom Jobs continues to deny as his daughter. He also brings in John Sculley (Matthew Modine) to become the CEO of the company. As his behavior becomes more erratic (for example firing an employee for not appreciating his investment in using fonts), Jobs is moved away from The Lisa to the Macintosh Group where he works with Bill Atkinson, Burrell Smith (Lenny Jacobson), Chris Espinosa, and Andy Hertzfeld (Elden Henson). He also forces the original team leader of the Macintosh group, Jef Raskin, out of it. Though the Macintosh is introduced with a great deal of fanfare in 1984, Jobs is forced out of the company by Sculley in 1985.\n\nThe film jumps forward to 1996. Jobs is married to Laurene Powell Jobs (Abby Brammell) and has accepted Lisa (Annika Bertea) as his daughter (she now lives with them). He has a son, Reed (Paul Baretto) and is also running the company NeXT which Apple decides to buy. He is asked by then-CEO Gil Amelio to return to Apple as a consultant. Jobs does so and soon he is named the new CEO, ultimately firing Amelio and his ex-friend Markkula (who refused to support him when he was forced out of Apple 11 years prior). Jobs becomes interested in the work of Jony Ive (Giles Matthey) and works to reinvent Apple. The film ends with Jobs recording the dialogue for the \"Think Different\" commercial in 1997. Before the credits, there are original photos of all the main characters paired with clips from the film of the actor playing the part, plus a dedication to Steve Jobs.\n\n\n\n\nScreenwriter Matt Whiteley began work on the screenplay around the time Steve Jobs took medical leave from Apple to battle pancreatic cancer. Director Joshua Michael Stern stated in an interview that all material for the screenplay was collected via research and interviews:\n\nMark Hulme, our producer, had an expert team of researchers to comb through all public records and interviews that had anything to do with Steve Jobs. Mark, the screenwriter and the research team, also took it upon themselves to interview quite a large pool of people who either worked at Apple or worked with Steve to make sure we portrayed as accurate a portrait and telling of the events possible within the constraints of the film's length.\n\nProduction began in June 2012 at Jobs' childhood home in Los Altos, California, with the help of Jobs' stepmother, Marilyn Jobs (who still lives there). It was also observed by his sister Patricia. UCLA was used as the backdrop for Jobs' time at Reed College. The majority of the film was shot in the Los Angeles region. Russell Carpenter was the cinematographer.\n\nIn August 2012, production moved to New Delhi and Vrindavan in order to provide the setting for Jobs' 1974 trek to India. Locations include \"Delhi's Jama Masjid, the Hauz Khas Complex, Safdarjung Tomb and Humayun's Tomb.\" Aseem Bajaj (\"Bandit Queen\", \"Chameli\", and \"Khoya Khoya Chand\") served as cinematographer for scenes shot in India, though cinematographer Russell Carpenter went to India as well. Bajaj notes that they \"shot guerrilla style in the crazy and mad by-lanes of Chandni Chowk in Old Delhi. We shot near the Red Fort and the famous Jama Masjid for two full days with multiple cameras spread across everywhere. Ashton stood frozen with the chaos staring right in his face which helped us capture what Steve Jobs must have felt on his visit to India.\"\n\nThe \"Business Insider\" described the film's opening as a box office flop, earning $6.7 million in its first weekend and placed seventh overall.\n\nIt had a worldwide gross of $35.9 million against its $12 million budget, making the film a modest box office success.\n\n\"E! Online\" said, \"Critics have taken the film to task for a reach that falls far short of its ambition, marred by its superficial and unsatisfying portrait of an icon who deserved better.\" \"Forbes\" reported that the consensus among critics was \"mixed positives for Kutcher's performance\" and a \"thumbs down for Joshua Michael Stern's film.\" On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 28% rating, based on 130 reviews, with a weighted average of 4.9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"An ambitious but skin-deep portrait of an influential, complex figure, \"Jobs\" often has the feel of an over-sentimentalized made-for-TV biopic.\" Review aggregator Metacritic gave the film a score of 44 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nRobert X. Cringely, author of \"Accidental Empires\" and creator of the documentaries \"Triumph of the Nerds\" and \"\", argues that \"the film is beautifully shot and Kutcher's portrayal of Jobs, while not spot-on, is pretty darned good. He certainly has the look down and the walk. But Ashton Kutcher also produced this film and he's definitely a better actor than producer. There are a lot of historical inaccuracies that just don't have to be there. ... The great failing of this film is the same failing as with Walter Isaacson's book: something happened during Steve's NeXT years (which occupy less than 60 seconds of this 122 minute film) that turned Jobs from a brat into a leader, but they don't bother to cover that.\" Mick LaSalle of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" states that \"at its best, it's a good picture, and at its worst, it's almost good.\" Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" suggests that \"Kutcher nails the genius and narcissism. It's a quietly dazzling performance\" but also notes that \"\"Jobs\" is a one-man show that needed to go for broke and doesn't. My guess is that Jobs would give it a swat.\" Contributor for rogerebert.com, Susan Wloszczyna, gave the movie 2/4 stars, saying that, \"Rather than attempting a deeper plunge behind the whys and wherefores of the elite business-model gospel according to Apple Inc. guru Steve Jobs and – more importantly – what it says about our culture, the filmmakers follow the easy rise-fall-rise-again blueprint familiar to anyone who has seen an episode of VH1's \"Behind the Music\".\" She further discusses how Kutcher's performance and the overall movie failed to portray Jobs in iconic manner that current pop culture suggests even after Jobs' passing. In a movie review for \"The New York Times\", writer Manohla Dargis writes that \"Jobs\" was \"inevitably unsatisfying\" and a result of a poor performance of the filmmakers rather than the actors themselves.\n\nIn a January 2013 interview with \"The Verge\", Steve Wozniak notes that he was approached by the crew of \"Jobs\" and given an early script to read. He read it as far as he \"could stomach it and felt it was crap. The Sony people got in contact with me too and in the end I went with them. You can't do both [films] and be paid.\" At around the same time, he responded to the first promotional clip for the film on \"Gizmodo\" by stating that the \"personalities are very wrong, although mine is closer ... our relationship was so different than what was portrayed.\"\n\nIn August 2013, before the wide release of the film, Kutcher responded to these critiques in a few interviews. In an interview with the Associated Press, Kutcher stated that: \"Steve Wozniak is being paid by another company to support their Steve Jobs film. It's personal for him, but it's also business. We have to keep that in mind. He was also extremely unavailable to us when producing this film. He's a brilliant man and I respect his work, but he wasn't available to us as a resource, so his account isn't going to be our account because we don't know exactly what it was. We did the best job we could. Nobody really knows what happened in the rooms.\" He reiterated this point in an interview with \"The Hollywood Reporter\" by stating that Wozniak \"is being paid by another movie studio to help support their Steve Jobs film, so he's gonna have an opinion that is connected to that, somewhat.\" Wozniak responded to Kutcher's comments as well as to the film itself on \"Gizmodo\" by stating that \"either film would have paid me to consult, but the \"Jobs \"one already had a script written. I can't take that creative leadership from someone else. And I was turned off by the \"Jobs\" script. But I still hoped for a great movie.\" He also believed several individuals portrayed in the film were inaccurately and/or unfairly portrayed including himself and Steve Jobs. Wozniak reiterated these points in an interview with Bloomberg Television adding that he is \"really easy to get a hold of, [Kutcher] could have called me and consulted over the phone any time.\" \"The Verge\" noted that \"Wozniak was in fact invited to consult on the film, but declined after reading the script, saying he and his wife were 'abhorred' by it. Wozniak was a consultant on Aaron Sorkin's 2015 \"Steve Jobs\" film. When asked why he did not at least correct the inaccuracies he saw, Wozniak said, 'I have a very busy life, and it came at a very busy time in my life.'\"\n\nIn an interview with \"Slashdot\", Daniel Kottke states that he consulted on early versions of the screenplay and notes that \"Ashton's very good. I have no complaints with him at all, no complaints with his portrayal of Jobs. The complaint that people would rightly have about the film is that it portrays Woz as not having the same vision as Steve Jobs, which is really unfair.\" He also said that the early versions of the screenplay \"were painful. Really painful. I forwarded the first draft to Mike Markkula because they wanted his feedback, and Mike took such a bad reaction to it, he wouldn't have anything more to do with the project. By the time it got to the fourth draft, it was okay. It wasn't making me cringe.\" Kottke also outlines various areas that were both accurate and inaccurate in the film. Bill Fernandez was part of the same interview but states that he didn't see the film because \"the whole thing is a work of fiction, and I don't want to be upset by all the things that the screenwriter has invented and don't represent the truth.\" Kottke responded that he didn't think of the film as fiction because \"I was involved early on in the film, and they really, sincerely tried to make it as accurate as they could.\"\n\nIn the same interview, Fernandez and Kottke commented on the characterization of Rod Holt (portrayed by actor Ron Eldard). Kottke disputed the characterization, noting that: \"What completely cracked us all up is the scene where Rod arrives for the first time. Rod comes up wearing leathers, riding up on a motorcycle with long hair ... he's like this motorcycle dude. It just cracked us all up.\" Fernandez, who had not seen the film at the time of the interview, was also surprised by this portrayal. Holt, however, (according to Kottke), \"thought it was hilarious.\" As for why he may have been characterized this way, Kottke states that, \"Rod was really into dirt bikes. And I never saw him riding one, but he talked about it all the time. So the author just had him riding up on a motorcycle. I liked that guy. I met him on the set. I had no idea who he was when I met him because he doesn't look at all like Rod, he has long straight hair and he's wearing leathers.\" Fernandez, who was equally amused by this vision of Holt responded by asking, \"Who could this possibly be in the Apple universe? ... It seems to me that there's a lot of fan fiction about Apple Computer and about Steve Jobs, and I think that this is the biggest, flashiest piece of fan fiction that there's been to date.\nChris Espinosa stated on Twitter, \"FYI My position at Apple precludes my commenting on the #JobsMovie with the press or public. But I can say that I enjoyed watching the film.\"\n\nThe TV show \"John Wants Answers\" took Wozniak, Kottke, and Andy Hertzfeld through the film scene by scene and discussed how the events actually occurred.\n\nA number of classic rock, classical music, and contemporary works appeared in the film.

Paul Getty. While living in Rome in 1973, he was kidnapped for a $17 million ransom. His grandfather was reluctant to pay, as it could have put his other grandchildren in danger. After his severed ear was received by a newspaper, a deal was done, and Getty was released. He developed drug and alcohol addiction, leading to paraplegia\nfor life.\n\nGetty was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He spent most of his childhood in Rome while his father headed the Italian division of the Getty family oil business. His parents divorced in 1964 when he was eight years old, and his father married model and actress Talitha Pol in 1966. The family adopted a hippie lifestyle, spending much time in Britain and Morocco during the 1960s. Getty remained in Italy with his mother Gail and attended St. George's British International School in Rome. \n\nIn early 1972, Getty was expelled from St. George's after painting offensive six-feet high wording in a hallway of the school, aimed at the school's headmaster. Later that year, his stepmother died of a heroin overdose in Rome, and his father moved back to the United Kingdom, partly to escape charges of drug possession which he was facing in Italy. Paul remained in Italy where he lived a bohemian lifestyle, living in a squat, frequenting nightclubs and taking part in left-wing demonstrations. He had considerable artistic talent and reportedly earned a living making jewelry, selling his paintings and cartoons, and appearing in movies as an extra. The Italian adult magazine \"Playmen\" paid him $1,000 to appear naked in a spread and on the cover of its August 1973 issue, released a month after he was kidnapped.\n\nGetty was kidnapped in the Palazzo Farnese in Rome at 3 a.m. on July 10, 1973, when he was 16. According to his girlfriend Martine Schmidt, he had toyed with the idea of getting himself kidnapped by petty criminals when the couple were struggling to make ends meet, but he had changed his mind because both of them started getting work modelling for photographers. She stated that \"Paul didn't want to be kidnapped anymore, but [the kidnappers] were following him.\" He was blindfolded, transported, and imprisoned in a cave. The kidnappers issued a ransom note demanding $17 million (equivalent to $ in ) in exchange for his safe return. When that message arrived, some family members suspected that the kidnapping was merely a ploy by Getty. The kidnappers sent a second demand, but its arrival was delayed by an Italian postal strike.\n\nJohn Paul Getty Jr. asked his father J. Paul Getty for the money, but his father refused, arguing that his 13 other grandchildren could also become kidnap targets if he paid. As time wore on, Paul's treatment by his captors grew worse; they took away his radio, killed a bird that he had taken as a pet, and began playing Russian roulette against his head.\n\nIn November 1973, a daily newspaper received an envelope containing a lock of hair, a human ear, and a threat from the kidnappers to mutilate Paul further unless they were paid $3.2 million (equivalent to $ in ). The letter read, \"This is Paul's first ear. If within ten days the family still believes that this is a joke mounted by him, then the other ear will arrive. In other words, he will arrive in little bits.\" Paul's health began to decline rapidly as his wound became infected, combined with pneumonia caused by the cold winter temperatures which were descending. His captors were alarmed at this sudden decline and gave him large doses of penicillin to treat the infection, which caused him to develop an allergy to the antibiotic and further affected his health. Getty's biographer John Pearson attributed his later alcoholism to the large amounts of brandy that he was plied with in the last few months of his captivity to keep him warm and numb his pain.\nAfter Paul's ear was sent, his grandfather negotiated a deal to get him back for about $2.9 million (equivalent to $ in ). He paid $2.2 million—the maximum amount that was tax deductible—and lent the remainder to his son, who was responsible for repaying the sum at 4% interest. Paul was found alive on December 15, 1973, in a petrol station of Lauria in the province of Potenza shortly after the ransom was paid. At his mother's suggestion, he called his grandfather to thank him for paying the ransom, but J. Paul Getty refused to come to the phone.\n\nNine of the kidnappers were apprehended, including Girolamo Piromalli and Saverio Mammoliti, high-ranking members of the 'Ndrangheta, a Mafia organization in Calabria. Two of the kidnappers were convicted and sent to prison; the others were acquitted for lack of evidence, including the 'Ndrangheta bosses. Most of the ransom money was never recovered. In 1977, Getty had an operation to rebuild the ear that his kidnappers had cut off.\n\nIn 1974, Getty married German Gisela Martine Zacher (née Schmidt) who was five months pregnant. He had known her and her twin sister Jutta since before his kidnapping, and he was 18 years old when his son Balthazar was born in 1975. The couple divorced in 1993.\n\nGetty acted in some European films, playing supporting parts in Raúl Ruiz's \"The Territory\" and in Wim Wenders's \"The State of Things\". He and his wife lived for a time in New York City where they consorted with Andy Warhol's art crowd.\n\nGetty was permanently affected by his kidnapping and suffered from drug and alcohol addiction during the years that followed. In 1981, he drank a Valium, methadone, and alcohol cocktail which caused liver failure and a stroke, leaving him quadriplegic, partially blind, and unable to speak. Afterwards, his mother cared for him, and he sued his father for $28,000 a month to cover his medical needs. He never fully recovered and remained severely handicapped for the rest of his life. By 1987, however, he was able to regain some degree of autonomy, and he was able to ski when strapped to a metal frame.\n\nIn 1999, Getty and several other members of his family became citizens of the Republic of Ireland in return for investments of approximately £1 million each, under a law which has since been repealed.\n\nGetty died at his father's estate at Wormsley Park, Buckinghamshire, on February 5, 2011, aged 54, following a long illness. He had been in poor health since his 1981 drug overdose.\n\nA. J. Quinnell used Getty's kidnapping as one piece of inspiration for his book \"Man on Fire\". The 1995 book \"Painfully Rich: the Outrageous Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Heirs of J. Paul Getty\" by John Pearson includes significant content on Getty's kidnapping ordeal. The book was adapted to the 2017 film \"All the Money in the World\", directed by Sir Ridley Scott. In the film, John Paul Getty III is played by Charlie Plummer (as an adult) and Charlie Shotwell (at age 7). The kidnapping is also dramatized in the 2018 television series \"Trust\", produced by Simon Beaufoy and Danny Boyle, with Harris Dickinson as John Paul Getty III.\n\n"}

{"id": "6872021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6872021", "title": "Louis Zborowski", "text": "Louis Zborowski\n\nCount Louis Vorow Zborowski (20 February 1895 – 19 October 1924) was an English racing driver and automobile engineer.\n\nHis father, William Eliot Morris Zborowski (1858–1903) was also a racing driver, and died in a racing crash, in 1903 at La Turbie Hillclimb in Nice, France. His mother was a wealthy American heiress, born Margaret Laura Astor Carey (1853–1911), a granddaughter of William Backhouse Astor, Sr. and Margaret Rebecca Armstrong of the prominent Astor family. She had been Madame de Stuers before her divorce and marriage in 1892 to Eliot Zborowski.\n\nAfter the death of his father in 1903, in 1910 his mother bought the Higham Park estate at Bridge near Canterbury in Kent. Paying £17,500 to the executors of the estate of London banker William Gay, the sale included a farm, and twelve houses. Mrs. Zborowski immediately commissioned a £50,000 refurbishment of the house from the architect Joseph Sawyer.\n\nOn her death in 1911, 16-year-old Louis instantly became the fourth richest under-21-year-old in the world, with cash of £11 million and real estate in the United States, including of Manhattan and several blocks on Fifth Avenue, New York.\n\nZborowski's career as an amateur racing driver encompassed a wide experience of marques and events. He was an early patron of Aston Martin, and raced for them at Brooklands and in the 1923 French Grand Prix. In 1921 Zborowski was to drive one of the 1921 Grand Prix Sunbeams representing Britain at Le Mans but this did not transpire and instead he raced the car at the International Shelsley Walsh - England’s foremost Speed Hill-Climb.\n\nZborowski designed and built four of his own racing cars in the stables at Higham Park, assisted by his engineer and co-driver Captain Clive Gallop, who was later racing engineer to the \"Bentley Boys\".\n\nThe first car was powered by a 23,093 cc six-cylinder Maybach aero engine and called \"Chitty Bang Bang\". A second \"Chitty Bang Bang\" was powered by 18,825 cc Benz aero engine. A third car was based on a Mercedes 28/95, but fitted with a 14,778 cc 6-cylinder Mercedes aero engine and was referred to as the White Mercedes. These cars achieved some success at Brooklands.\n\nAnother car, also built at Higham Park with a huge 27-litre American Liberty aero engine, was called the \"Higham Special\". After Zborowski's death the \"Higham Special\" was purchased by J.G. Parry-Thomas to make bids on the land speed record. Designer/driver Thomas improved the car and christened her \"Babs\". In April 1926 J.G. Parry-Thomas successfully took the Land Speed Record at over 170 mph at Pendine Sands. Thomas' second attempt at the same location in 1927 turned out fatal. At over 100 mph the car overturned and caught fire, killing the driver. \"Babs\" has been restored and can be seen either at the Pendine Sands museum of speed in the summer months or in the Brooklands Museum during other months of the year.\n\nIn January 1922 Louis, his wife Vi, Clive Gallop and Pixi Marix together with a couple of mechanics took Chitty Bang Bang 2 and the White Mercedes across the Mediterranean for a drive into the Sahara Desert, in the tracks of Citroën's Kégresse-track-equipped expedition.\n\nIn the 1923 Indianapolis 500 Zborowski drove a Bugatti. He drove in the 1923 Italian Grand Prix at Monza in a car designed by American engineer Harry Arminius Miller, the single-seat \"American Miller 122\".\n\nZborowski joined the Mercedes team in 1924 but died in one of their cars, after hitting a tree during the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. He was just 29 years old.\nZborowski was a railway enthusiast and a gauge railway circuit, the Higham Railway, was built around his estate in Kent. This line was part of the inspiration behind the joint decision by Zborowski and his racing friend Captain J.E.P. Howey to construct a long-distance passenger-carrying railway line in the same gauge. Many locations were investigated, but this eventually led to the founding of the long Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway in Kent, which remains a popular tourist attraction and means of local transport. Zborowski ordered a steam locomotive from Bassett-Lowke, which ran on the Higham Railway in 1924. The locomotive was purchased by the Fairbourne Railway in Wales following the Count's death and named \"Count Louis\" in his honour. The locomotive remained at the Fairbourne until 1988. Zborowski also ordered the first locomotives for the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway from Davey Paxman & Co. of Essex. The order (and the project) was continued by Capt Howey alone, following the Count's death.\n\nThe children's book by Ian Fleming, \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\", and the subsequent musical film, were inspired by the romance of Zborowski's exploits. Fleming had watched Zborowski race at Brooklands as a school boy, and later visited Higham Park (then known as Highland Court) as a friend of its later owner, Walter Whigham the chairman of Robert Fleming & Co. merchant bank founded by Ian's grandfather. In the third book, Zborowski is a major character, where his relationship to Chitty is explored and his future deadly crash is alluded to.\n\n"}

After graduating with an LL.M. degree in 1984, he became a lawyer for the Amsterdam office of law firm Baker & McKenzie. In 1989, he joined the management team of offshore company Heerema in Leiden. A management buyout made him part owner of salvage and towing company Wijsmuller in IJmuiden. From 1992 onwards, Muller led several companies, such as \"Emergo Mode Groep\" (Emergo Fashion Group), which would be launched on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange as McGregor Fashion Group.\n\nMuller and Maarten de Bruijn bought the name to the Dutch car company Spyker Cars in 2000, renewing the Spyker name which had been used surrounding car production in the 1920s. Muller was the CEO of the company until May 16, 2007, when he was succeeded by Michiel Mol. Muller continued to work for the company as chief designer for a period, but returned to the CEO seat later the same year, due to the split up between Spyker Cars and Spyker F1 (later Force India) while Mol continued as CEO for the latter.\n\nMuller was found guilty of sharing insider information in 2007. He sent an email to bank Theodoor Gilissen, requesting they not sell shares used as security for a personal loan. In the email Muller stated that Spyker would soon release a favourable press-release, which would increase the value of his shares. Victor Muller was initially fined €96,000. The fine was reduced in May 2012 to €11,400.\n\nOn 2 December 2014 Spyker NV was granted a financial restructuring by the Dutch court \"Midden Nederland\". Spyker needs protection from creditors for its liquidity problems. Victor R. Muller, Spyker founder and chief executive, said “Over the past few years, Spyker has faced a number of serious difficulties and challenges resulting from, among others, the legacy of the F1 era and the acquisition of Saab Automobile AB,”.\n\nOn 18 December 2014 Spyker NV was declared bankrupt by the Dutch court \"Midden Nederland\". Victor R. Muller, Spyker founder and chief executive, said “In 2000 our objective was to found a global sports car manufacturer, and we did just that. During this time we deployed several challenging activities. These have affected the company , and contributed to our decline,”.\n\nOnce in an interview with Tech Toys 360 by Channel Discovery Science, he told that the first word he said in his childhood was Car. He was interested in cars from his childhood. He started collecting cars before he got driving lincence. He was much passionated about cars that it seems he was born just for car\n\nMuller was also the chairman of the company Swedish Automobile, which was formed after the takeover of Saab Automobile by Spyker Cars. Saab Automobile was declared bankrupt in December 2011. A meeting on Saab's bankruptcy was held at the District Court of Vänersborg on the 16 April 2012. In April 2012, the Swedish curators made public that SAAB has a debt of over US$2 billion after subtracting the value of assets.\n\nIn March 2011, a Swedish biography of Victor Muller was published, Cirkus Muller, by journalist Jens B Nordström.\n\nIn August 2012, Muller, stated that Spyker Cars will sue General Motors over Saab's bankruptcy.\nMuller, stated, \"Ever since we were forced to file for Saab Automobile’s bankruptcy in December of last year, we have worked relentlessly on the preparation for this lawsuit, which seeks to compensate Spyker and Saab for the massive damages we have incurred as a result of GM’s unlawful actions\". On 22 June 2013, a District Court Judge dismissed the case. According to Judge Gershwin A. Drain, \"General Motors had a contractual right to approve or disapprove the proposed transaction,\" and \"The court is going to grant the motion to dismiss the matter.\"\n\nSpyker Cars NV appealed the ruling. The appeal was heard at the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati. The court said on Friday October 24, 2014 that GM did not intentionally interfered with the Dutch company's effort to sell Saab to Zhejiang Youngman Lotus Automobile Co, leading to Saab's bankruptcy. Judge Eugene Siler said GM's actions were not malicious, and that it had \"legitimate business concerns\" about the sale, including who would benefit from Saab's use of its technology. Siler said that Spyker's claim was \"fatally flawed\".\n\nSince May 2013, Muller, has been a prime suspect of corporate tax evasion. As of 19 February 2016 Muller will be prosecuted by the Swedish tax authorities.\n\n"}
