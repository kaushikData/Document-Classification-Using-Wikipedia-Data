It may apply both to tangible assets (physical objects such as buildings or equipment) and to intangible assets (such as human capital, intellectual property, goodwill and/or financial assets). Asset management is a systematic process of developing, operating, maintaining, upgrading, and disposing of assets in the most cost-effective manner (including all costs, risks and performance attributes).\n\nThe term is commonly used in the financial sector to describe people and companies who manage investments on behalf of others. Those include, for example, investment managers that manage the assets of a pension fund.\n\nIt is also increasingly used in both the business world and public infrastructure sectors to ensure a coordinated approach to the optimization of costs, risks, service/performance and sustainability. \n\nThe International Standard, ISO 55000, provides a introduction and requirements specification for a management system for asset management.\n\nThe most common usage of the term \"asset manager\" refers to investment management, the sector of the financial services industry that manages investment funds and segregated client accounts. Asset management is part of a financial company which employs experts who manage money and handle the investments of clients. From studying the client's assets to planning and looking after the investments, all things are looked after by the asset managers and recommendations are provided based on the financial health of each client.\n\nInfrastructure asset management is the combination of management, financial, economic, engineering, and other practices applied to physical assets with the objective of providing the best value level of service for the costs involved. It includes the management of the entire life cycle—including design, construction, commissioning, operating, maintaining, repairing, modifying, replacing and decommissioning/disposal—of physical and infrastructure assets. Operation and maintenance of assets in a constrained budget environment require a prioritization scheme. As a way of illustration, the recent development of renewable energy has seen the rise of effective asset managers involved in the management of solar systems (solar park, rooftops and windmills). These teams often collaborate with financial asset managers in order to offer turnkey solutions to investors. Infrastructure asset management became very important in most of the developed countries in the 21st century, since their infrastructure network was almost completed in the 20th century and they have to manage to operate and maintain them cost-effectively.\nSoftware asset management is one kind of infrastructure asset management.\n\nThe International Organization for Standardization published its management system standard for asset management in 2014.. The ISO 55000 series provides terminology, requirements and guidance for implementing, maintaining and improving an effective asset management system.\n\n\nEnterprise asset management (EAM) systems are asset \"information\" systems that support the management of an organization's assets. An EAM includes an asset registry (inventory of assets and their attributes) combined with a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) and other modules (such as inventory or materials management). Assets that are geographically distributed, interconnected or networked, are often also represented through the use of geographic information systems (GIS).\n\nGIS-centric asset registry standardizes data and improves interoperability, providing users the capability to reuse, coordinate, and share information in an efficient and effective manner . A GIS platform combined with information of both the \"hard\" and \"soft\" assets helps to remove the traditional silos of departmental functions. While the hard assets are the typical physical assets or infrastructure assets, the soft assets might include permits, licenses, brands, patents, right-of-ways and other entitlements or valued items.\n\nThe EAM system is only one of the 'enables' to good asset management. Asset managers need to make informed decisions in order to fulfill their organizational goals, this requires good asset information but also leadership, clarity of strategic priorities, competencies, inter-departmental collaboration and communications, workforce and supply chain engagement, risk and change management systems, performance monitoring and continual improvement.\n\nPublic asset management, also called corporate asset management, expands the definition of enterprise asset management (EAM) by incorporating the management of all things of value to a municipal jurisdiction and its citizens' expectations. An example in which public asset management is used is land-use development and planning.\n\nIncreasingly both consumers and organizations use assets, e.g. software, music, books, etc. where the user's rights are constrained by a license agreement. An asset management system would identify the constraints upon such licenses, e.g. a time period. If, for example, one licenses software, often the license is for a given period of time. Adobe and Microsoft both offer time based software licenses. In both the corporate and consumer worlds, there is a distinction between software ownership and the updating of software. One may own a version of software, but not newer versions of the software. Cellular phones are often not updated by vendors, in an attempt to force purchase of newer hardware. Large companies such as Oracle, that license software to clients distinguish between the right to use and the right to received maintenance/support.\n\n\n\n"}

At a height of 521 ft (158.8 m), Atelier looks over the Hudson River located a block away to the West. The building stands 46-stories tall and contains a total of 478 individual units.\n\nThe building's name comes from the word for an artist's workshop. The building features an art gallery on the ground floor and often holds exhibitions of artwork. The gallery is also visible from the street and includes the lobby of the building as part of its exhibit space. As of January 2009, it featured the works of graphic designer and New York-based artist Milton Glaser.\n\nIn 2011, solar panels were installed on the roof of the building capable of generating five percent of the energy needs of the building. As of 2013, solar panels were generating ten percent of the building's energy needs. In 2014, Atelier became one of the first buildings in New York to include an ice-skating rink on the roof of the building which was installed by Daniel Neiditch, president of the condo board who owns many units in the building.The rooftop terrace is also the location of a private lounge open to residents of the building. As of 2014, the building also has several other amenities such as access to a playground, a basketball court, and a tennis court.\n\nIn 2016, Atelier promoted the most expensive planned condominium property in New York City. The penthouse property spanning the entire 45th floor of the building and including 10 bedrooms and 13 bathrooms was listed in 2016 at $85 million. It was to be created by combining nine units located on the top floor. The plan was to include such lavish amenities as a one-million-dollar yacht, two Rolls-Royce Phantoms, and a year's worth of \"live-in butler services – as well as a private chef\".\n\nAtelier was designed by Costas Kondylis. Construction on the building began in 2004 and was completed in 2007. Atelier was part of the company's development project of Manhattan's West Side which included several buildings along 11th Avenue. The building has been a popular destination for celebrities including Deborah Cox, Brendan Fraser, Lindsay Lohan, Mekhi Phifer, and Dania Ramirez, some of whom have used it for brief stays in New York while performing on Broadway.\n"}

The goal of the project is to aggregate all open access content distributed across different systems, such as repositories and open access journals, enrich this content using text mining and data mining, and provide free access to it through a set of services. The CORE project also aims to promote open access to scholarly outputs. It fully supports the taxpayer's entitlement to the research they have funded and facilitates the wide dissemination of the open access content. CORE works closely with digital libraries and institutional repositories.\n\nBased on the open access fundamental principles, as they were described in the Budapest Open Access Initiative, the open access content not only must be openly available to download and read, but it must also allow its reuse, both by humans and machines. As a result, there was a need to exploit the content reuse, which could be made possible with the implementation of a technical infrastructure. Thus the CORE project started with the goal of connecting metadata and full-text outputs offering, via the content aggregation, value-added services, and opening new opportunities in the research process.\n\nCurrently there are existing commercial academic search systems, such as Google Scholar, which provide search and access level services, but do not support programmable machine access to the content, for example with the use of an API or data dumps. This limits the further reuse of the open access content, for example, with regards to text and data mining. Taking into consideration that there are three access levels to content: 1. access at the granularity of papers, 2. analytical access and granularity of collections and 3. programmable machine access to data the programmable machine access is the main feature that distinguishes CORE from Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic Search.\n\nThe first version of CORE was created in 2011 by Petr Knoth with the aim to make it easier to access and text mine very large amounts of research publications. The value of the aggregation was first demonstrated by developing a content recommendation system for research papers, following the ideas of literature-based discovery introduced by Don R. Swanson. Since its start, CORE has received financial support from a range of funders including Jisc and the European Commission. Although CORE aggregates from across the world, it has the status of the UK's national aggregator of open access content, aggregating metadata and full-text outputs from both UK publishers' databases as well as institutional and subject repositories. The service operates as a one step search tool for UK's open access research outputs, facilitating easy discoverability, use and reuse. The importance of the service has been widely recognised by Jisc, which suggested that CORE should preserve the required resources to sustain its operation and explore an international sustainability model.\nCORE is now one of the Repository Shared Services projects, along with Sherpa Services, IRUS-UK, Jisc Publications Router and OpenDOAR.\n\nCORE data can be accessed through an API or downloaded as a pre-processed and semantically enriched data dump.\n\nCORE provides searchable access to a collection of over 125 millions of open access harvested research outputs. All outputs can be accessed and downloaded free of cost and have limited re-use restrictions. One can search the CORE content using a faceted search. CORE also provides a cross-repository content recommendation system based on full-texts. The collection of the harvested outputs is available either by looking at the latest additions or by browsing the collection at the date of harvesting.\nThe CORE search engine has been selected as one of the top 10 search engines for open access research, facilitating access to academic papers. CORE ranks second among the most useful databases of searching electronic thesis and dissertations (ETDs).\n\nThe availability of data aggregated and enriched by CORE provides opportunities for the development of new analytical services for research literature. These can be used, for example, to monitor growth and trends in research, validate compliance with open access mandates and to develop new automatic metrics for evaluating research excellence.\n\nCORE offers eight applications:\n\n"}

Thamrin Road or Thamrin Road) is a major thoroughfare in Jakarta. The road is located at the center of Jakarta, running from Bundaran HI at the south end to the roundabout near Arjuna Wijaya Statue at the north end. Developed in the 1950s, the road was a landmark of post-colonial Indonesia and continue to have a prominent importance in Jakarta.\n\nThamrin Road is classified as a secondary arterial road in Jakarta. \n\nThe road passes through five urban administrative villages:\n\nThamrin Road is closed to traffic every Sunday from 6:00 until 11:00 as part of Jakarta Car Free Days campaign.\n\nThe road that would become Thamrin Road first appear around late 1910s as a small lane running from Koningsplein West (now Medan Merdeka Barat) to Kebon Sirih. This lane was known as Gang Timboel. Prominent landmark near this small lane was a 19th-century Armenian Church for the Armenian community of Batavia. The church has been demolished. The former location of the Armenian Church is the green within the complex of Bank Indonesia.\n\nThe development of the suburb Kebayoran in 1949 raised the need to link the suburb with the city center of Jakarta, and thus work on a new \"highway\" began in the same year. The northern half of this new highway received the name Jalan M.H. Thamrin by January 1951, after Indonesian National Hero Mohammad Husni Thamrin. To avoid the occupation of the newly opened lands by illegal squatters - a major problem at the time - the government sold these lands cheaply to those who committed to build on it within three to six months. Despite this, time extensions had to be granted because buyers could not arrange finance or procure building materials. \n\nAmong the early projects situated in Thamrin Road were Sarinah Department Store, Bank Dagang Negara building (now Wisma Mandiri), Ministry of Religion building, Wisma Nusantara, Hotel Indonesia and the prominent Bundaran Hotel Indonesia. Thamrin Road was largely completed by 1953.\n\nWith the arrival of the 1962 Asian Games, President Sukarno imagined the VIP visitors for the Asian Games arriving at Kemayoran Airport, drove along Thamrin Road, be greeted by the Welcome Monument and stayed at Hotel Indonesia. For the Games itself, the same VIP visitors would be driven along Sudirman Road over the Semanggi cloverleaf bridge into the newly-opened Gelora Bung Karno sports complex where the competitions would take place. For the purpose of the game, both Thamrin and Sudirman Road were widened in the early 1960s. A regulation was also established which requires buildings along Thamrin Road to be minimum five-stories-high. This was difficult to achieve due to lack of funding and commercial building expertise at that time, and the fact that there were already several two-story government buildings along Thamrin Road.\n\nIn the beginning of 1970s, Thamrin Road was already a major thoroughfare of Jakarta as envisaged by Sukarno. Buildings reached a minimum height of five stories e.g. ICA building (later the United Nations), Hotel Asoka, the Australian Embassy, and the state-owned developer Pembangunan Perumahan. Sudirman Road was still relatively devoid of development during the early 1970s compare with Thamrin Road, with the exception of the Gelora Bung Karno sports complex. \n\nSeveral parades were enacted along the major thoroughfare, including Jakarta's anniversary parade and Independence Day parade.\n\nUp until the 2000s, Thamrin Road consisted of four carriageways consisting of local-express lanes, 3 lanes for the express lane and 2 lanes for the local lane. With the introduction of TransJakarta BRT in 2004, one of the lane of the express lanes was converted into a dedicated lane for the BRT.

He invented a modern adjustable spanner (patents in 1891 and 11 May 1892). He obtained over 100 patents in total.\n\nHe was born in Vårgårda in western Sweden, the oldest of six children in a crofter's family. His was first employed as an assistant operator of a steam engine at a local peat factory. He left Vårgårda at age 19, in 1873, for Motala to work as a navvy. Following military service in 1874, he moved to Eskilstuna where he worked for the Bolinder-Munktell factory, and in 1878 he moved to Västerås where he found employment at a mechanical workshop. Following that, he worked as a blacksmith at a nearby farm.\n\nAt this time, he had made a decision to leave Sweden for the United States. This never happened; he was instead offered a more esteemed job by his former employer Munktells, and the offer changed his mind.\n\nHe eventually decided to start his own business and, in 1886, moved to Enköping where he started \"Enköpings Mekaniska Verkstad\" (the Mechanical Workshop of Enköping) which quickly became a successful venture. It was during the years in his workshop that he invented the adjustable spanner and the plumber wrench. In 1890, B.A. Hjorth & Company agreed to distribute his tools worldwide under the \"Bahco\" trademark. The Bahco tools became greatly successful, and the company is still in operation and has manufactured over 100 million wrenches to date.\n\nJohansson transferred the then-large enterprise to his son, Hannes Brynge, and the B.A. Hjorth & Company in 1916. He started experimenting with electrical armature and in 1919 opened a new factory, Triplex, which manufactured electrical pendulums and various devices.\nHe died 89 years old after having been productive for the most of his life.\n\n"}

He was a commercial agent in New York and later a business owner in Cork. His business played a pivotal role in creating infrastructure that connected Dublin to Cork. Anderson purchased land in Fermoy that was later used as a military complex. \n\nAnderson was born into a poor family at Portland near Dumfries, Scotland and moved to Glasgow in 1784. He later settled in Cork City, at that time the major provisioning centre on the Atlantic Coast. During the American wars he earned considerable sums as a commercial agent in New York, and made extensive land purchases in the Cork area.\n\nHis Cork enterprise was based at Lapp's Island, and his business acumen was recognised as he grew rapidly in fortune and was appointed to the city's committee of merchants. He was made a Freeman of the city in 1787. Among his business interests was a malting and warehouse complex at Ballinacurra on Cork Harbour in partnership with John Lapp, in the 1780s. In common with many Cork merchants he was in favour of union with Great Britain in 1800. Anderson's Quay in Cork is called after him. He married a Miss Semple and had two daughters and two sons, one of whom, James Caleb Anderson (1782–1861), was a noted experimenter with steam-driven road vehicles.\n\nHis fortunes suffered a series of reversals with the fall in the value of land after the Napoleonic Wars, and he lost over £30,000 in a Welsh mining venture. He had been conducting banking business and with the economic downturn his bank collapsed in 1816.\n\nAnderson secured the equivalent of a government franchise to provide a mail service from Dublin to Cork. This involved the building of an extensive infrastructure of roads, bridges, inns and stage coach stations. By 1789 he was the dominant partner in the Dublin–Cork turnpike and mail line, which was extended to Limerick in 1793. Its paramount achievement was getting from Dublin to Cork within 24 hours, the first Royal Mail arriving in Cork 8 July 1789.\n\nAnderson purchased lands in the Fermoy area in 1791 and responded to a British government demand for military barracks by offering to build to their order in Fermoy. The first barracks was for 1400 troop and 100 horses, later increased to a total of 3300 men. Soon a vast military complex with workshops and ancillary services together with coach workshops were functioning.\n\n\n"}

The site is adjacent to the A483 road and close to the Montgomery Canal. It is about south of Oswestry on the English side of the border, and about north of the Powys town of Welshpool.\n\nThis is a nationally significant industrial heritage area, containing one of only three remaining Hoffmann kilns in the country.\nIt provides key insights into industrial archaeology, as it was a major centre of the lime industry until the early 20th century. It is not known when the lime industry started here, but it may date back to medieval times or possibly earlier. The first reference to the site is on a map from 1753. Evidence of early settlement locally includes a prehistoric hill fort on Llanmynech HIll, while Offa's Dyke runs close to the site on the western perimeter. The area also has a long history of industrial activity, including copper and lead mining dating back to at least the Roman period.\n\nPrior to the opening of the Montgomery Canal (then known as the Ellesmere Canal) in 1796, limestone quarrying was undertaken on the site on a relatively small scale, although lime kilns for lime burning appear to have been within the quarry from at least 1753. In 1806 a tramway and incline was constructed to transport limestone from the quarry to a new wharf on the canal. A second tramway was constructed to the east of the site sometime between 1807–1837 and this became the main transport route, remaining in use until the closure of the quarry in 1914.\n\nThe 1863 opening of the Llanfyllin branch line, part of Cambrian Railways, had a major impact on the quarry, enabling much faster transportation of limestone and opening up new potential markets. Additional track and sidings were built along with two draw kilns – located to the west of the Hoffman kiln. Designed for continuous operation and built after 1874, these two kilns were abandoned by 1900.\n\nThe Hoffman kiln was the last major development on the site and is believed to have been built around 1900, along with additional tramways and rail track. The kiln, which is exceptionally well preserved, measures around and has two tunnel vaults entered through 14 round-headed arches. The chimney, a local landmark, stands on a plinth and is around high.\n\nA restoration project ran from 2006–2009, with funding from both the Heritage Lottery Fund and English Heritage. Additional financial support also came from the Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund and project partners, with the aim to conserve the site for visitors and educational purposes.\n\nAs part of the project, an archaeological investigation was carried out. Its main aim was to gather information about key features of the site – particularly the location of former tramways, ground surfaces and turntable track-beds.\n\nA local community project also received funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund, highlighting the importance of the area through initiatives including:\n\nSome artefacts discovered at the site in recent years are on display at Oswestry Town Museum. These range from tools and a quarryman's boot to a tramway sleeper, couplings and a pulley wheel.\n\nThis area contains a variety of short or long walks with routes leading passed lime kilns, woodland, canals, old railways, and grazed pastures. Along these routes are various information panels and sculptures to inform you about the area, some of these pathways are rough and so suitable footwear is recommended.\n\n"}

From 1998 until 2010, Hagyó was active in the Hungarian Socialist Party. Immediately following the April 2010 elections, when Hagyó lost his seat, he was arrested on suspicion of extortion and breach of fiduciary responsibility. The trial against Hagyó and 14 other suspects is currently underway in Kecskemét.\n\nIn 1989, Hagyó earned a bachelor's degree in Product Engineering from the former Budapest University of Horticulture and Food Industry in Szeged, Hungary. After the undergraduate studies, he relocated to the university's Budapest campus in pursuit of an advanced degree in Food Engineering from the Department of Economics. Hagyó claimed that he subsequently pursued doctoral work in the subject matter, but he was forced to abandon the academic project due to \"political and personal life difficulties\". Hagyó did however co-author a published scientific investigation into the \"conditions of the food retail trade units in Hungary\".\n\nResulting from the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989, and the subsequent transition to a market economy, Hungary saw a significant increase in foreign investment and trade after 1991. Taking advantage of that, Hagyó began working in 1992 for Wrigley's Hungarian operation, Hungaria. After working his way into an exclusive regional distribution position, Hagyó became involved in many start-up food distribution companies. According to him, he enjoyed financial growth and professional success \"thanks to the [post-Soviet] economic boom.\" \n\nIn 1998, Hagyó became a member of the Hungarian Socialist Party, citing Gyula Horn's \"personality and role\" as his attraction toward politics.\n\nFour years later, Hagyó was one of 178 socialists elected to the National Assembly, thus granting him the title Member of Parliament. Thereafter he served as the party's president of district XII in Budapest, which placed him on the party's national board. At various moments between July 2002 until May 2006, Hagyó was active in various parliamentary committees: Joint EU Institutions Committee, Regional Development Committee, Environmental Committee, and Foreign Affairs Committee. Also during that time, he delivered three speeches in Parliament, and he submitted a total of 55 independent and non autonomous motions.\n\nIn 2005, acting as the party's chairman for nationwide charitable activities, he and Dr. Lajos Oláh organized Hope for Transylvania. With the help of the Hungarian Red Cross, they collected and delivered food, medicine, tents, blankets, and other emergency supplies to residents in the severely flooded region. Moreover, he helped secure substantial funds from the Hungarian Red Cross in an effort to transport many of the victims to Hungary while the damaged communities were restored.\n\nDue to the social unrest of a 2006 scandal involving former Socialist Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány, many thought that opposing Fidesz representatives would oust the socialists from their seats in Budapest. Despite that, the Alliance of Free Democrats-Socialist coalition incumbent Gábor Demszky was re-elected. In addition to holding his parliamentary position, Hagyó was appointed as Deputy Mayor of Budapest on December 14, 2006. As Deputy Mayor, Hagyó wield political oversight over the city's urban and asset management responsibilities.\n\nDuring his second parliamentary term, Hagyó was active in the following committees between May 2006 and June 2007: Economic and Information Technology Commission, the Commission's Energy Subcommittee and the Enterprise Research and Development Subcommittee. Also during that allotted time, he made three speeches to Parliament, and he submitted a total of 15 independent and joint motions.\n\nAs a member of the Hungarian Olympic Committee, Hagyó was elected President of the Hungarian Synchronized Swimming Association (MSZSZ) in 2007 after the resignation of the previous president, Csaba Haranghy. In a 2010 interview, MSZSZ Secretary General Laszló Szimandl stated in an interview:\n\nAt that time, Hagyó was forced to resign from the socialist party and its associated position. He therefore was unable to remain the president of the synchronized swimming association.\n\nAccording to promotional videos, his pride of his Jászberény heritage - an ethnically mixed community due to historical wars - and his recognition of Roma soldiers, Hagyó is a supporter of ethnic diversity. During a March 2008 speech recognizing the efforts of Jews and Roma in the 1848 revolution, Hagyó reminded his Hungarian audience that the history of the Serbs, the Croatians, and the Poles are regrettably more known than that of the Romany soldiers.\n\nResponding to the 2008 Tibetan unrest, Hagyó signed a denunciatory petition to promote Hungarian political support for the Tibetans. While doing so, he urged all politician to come forth with support despite political affiliation. Moreover, Hagyó stated:\n\nIn 2009, BKV was investigated by city's police and the State Audit Office of Hungary because of an employee severance payment controversy. Many of BKV's upper management were interrogated concerning possible involvement.\n\nFormer BKV chief executive office Zsolt Balogh gave an interview to the daily newspaper \"Magyar Nemzet\" (Hungarian National) on March 6, 2010 and a separate interview the following day to HírTV. During the interviews, Balogh publicly accused Hagyó of extortion and breach of fiduciary duty. According to the accuser, he entered Hagyó's office \"in late September, early October 2007\" as the freshly promoted chief technology officer. Then and there, Balogh claimed, Hagyó dictated that Balogh must \"be hard, because things must be done here, and who doesn't do it\" will receive no mercy, and the throat \"must be cut.\"\n\nIn the same two interviews, Balogh alleged that during a later meeting in Gödöllő, Hagyó demanded from Balogh an annual \"membership fee\" of 15 million forints which would need to be paid directly to Hagyó. Balogh admitted that the following day he obliged to the demand. In the March 6th interview, Balogh stated that he met Hagyó in the office of Ottó Lelovics, former public relations and communication consultant to BKV. Then and there he passed 15 million forints to Hagyó. Balogh stated that he knew \"15 million fits in a Nokia box,\" so he hid the money inside a Nokia box designed for mobile phone packaging. As a result, this scandal has become known as the \"Nokia Box Case\" or the \"Magic Box Case.\"\n\nOn March 7, 2010 the online Hungarian news site \"Index.hu\" reported that Hagyó resigned from his local and national positions in the Hungarian Socialist Party. In the same article, the party's spokesman, István Nyakó, stated that the accusations had \"not been about the truth.\" Nyakó also explained that other socialist politicians did not want the scandal to hinder the party in the upcoming 2010 elections.\n\nImmediately following the change of government on May 14, 2010, Hagyó was detained by police. In addition to the bribery accusations from Balogh, police suspected him of instructing former BKV managing director Attila Antal of concluding an unnecessary contract with AAM and misappropriating funds related to the suburban railway line HÉV passenger information supply system.\n\nOn May 26, 2010 Hagyó was incarcerated at the Budapest Penitentiary in spite of numerous appeals from Hagyó's lawyer, András Kádár, who argued that his client suffered from numerous illnesses and no evidence supported the stringent measure. The signatory judge, Mária Szívós, cited the necessity of the coercive measure as prevention from suspect collusion and prevention from Hagyó fleeing the country. Prior to this, Hagyó communicated via his lawyer, András Kádár, willingness to cooperate in the ongoing investigation.\n\nHagyó's initial release date was June 17, 2010. The prosecution repeatedly proposed sentence extensions, which were approved by the Pest Central District Court and confirmed by the Municipal Court. Hagyó was released from prison into house arrest on February 13, 2011, and he remained on house arrest until June 8, 2011.\n\nOn September 6, 2010, 11 days before his pretrial detention circumstance would again be extended via order 28.AJC.No.1850/2010/2., Hagyó and Kádár filed application no.52624/10 with the European Court of Human Rights. In the application, they complained against validity of the pretrial detention and numerous prison conditions under Article 5 § 1 (c), Article 5 § 4 in conjunction with Article 13, Article 3, and Article 8 in conjunction with Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights. On April 23, 2013 the Court announced its decision, and in doing so they found the Hungarian judicial system to be in violation of the articles associated with the complaint.\n\nWhile supporters of Hagyó's detainment agreed that the alleged mafia boss needed to be detained before administering further damage, the judicial process through which the decisions were made to imprison Hagyó received much criticism. A Hungarian law student used the detainment and the subsequent trial as case studies, focusing on the issue of basic rights established by the Convention. The main points of contention were the prosecution's and court's unwillingness to allow neither Hagyó nor his lawyer access to the evidence which, according to the former bodies, necessitated an extended pretrial detention, especially when Hagyó suffered from deteriorating health.\n\nAs Hagyó was a young and popular socialist politician, some speculate that the detention and the trial have political, rather than criminal, motivations. This speculation stems from bloggers, academics, and journalists.\n\nCritics of Hagyó consider him a relic of Soviet-imposed communism, a symbol of corruption.\n\nWhile serving his pretrial detention at the Budapest Penitentiary, Miklós Hagyó, with legal oversight from Dr. Viktor Géza Szűcs, empowered his common-law wife to act on his behalf with regards to Hagyó's company, WIRTASS Trade and Service, LLC. on August 6, 2010. After receiving the authorization of the trial's prosecutor, the document was sent along with a letter from Hagyó's common-law wife to Brigader-General Csaba Boglyasovszky, the principal administrator of the Venyige Street Penal Enforcement Institution. In the letter, Hagyó's partner states that the new situation would require extraordinary visitation rights. She was previously allowed to visit Hagyó one time per month. In her request dated August 17, 2010 she states that \"I would also like to record, that the actual mutual confidence alone is not sufficient to provide [for WIRTASS LLC.] adequate, objective and rational basis for decision making.\" She therefore requested rights for two separate visitations per month to be \"at pre-announced times in accordance with the house rules of the penal enforcement institution.\" Principal Administrator Csaba Boglyasovszky positively replied to the request on August 19, 2010 and granted her a visitation on the 26th of August, 2010. In the letter, Boglyasovszky stated, \"Referring to the letter dated on the 17th of August 2010. I inform you that for visiting Miklós Hagyó detainee, to you as the legal representative is allowed.\"\n\nPrior to that, the television show Célpont aired by HírTV on March 21, 2010 allegedly showed material which were damaging to Miklós Hagyó and his partner. As a result, Hagyó filed a lawsuit against HírTV within the Budapest Regional Court. On August 6, 2010 Hagyó and Dr. Viktor Szűcs signed a document which granted Hagyó's common-law wife to act as his legal representative in the slander lawsuit. Hagyó presented this authorization to the prison via his counselor on September 2, 2010. \nThe prosecution observed this and the fact that Hagyó's common-law wife lacked the necessary legal qualifications. They therefore filed misdemeanor foregery charges against Hagyó, his partner, and Dr. Szűcs.\n\nAll three persons were cleared of the charges by the Pest District Central Court on January 16, 2012.\n\nThe trial of Miklós Hagyó and 14 other defendants is currently underway. It began in June 2012 at the Kecskemét Tribunal in the city of Kecskemét.\n\nTrial 1.B.73/2012 \"Hagyó Miklós és társai ellen bűnszervezetben elkövetett hűtlen kezelés bűntette és más bűncselekmények\n\"miatt \"(Against Miklós Hagyó and Others Who Perpetrated Organized Crimes of Misappropriation of Funds and Other Crimes), like the pretrial detention circumstances, has been shrouded in controversy. Apart from the speculative political nature of the case, red flags were raised when the trial was transferred from the Budapest Metropolitan Tribunal to the Kecskemét Tribunal.\n\nThe trial transfer was permitted under a temporary provision relating to the Act XIX. of 1998. (Criminal Proceedings) and Act LXXXIX. of 2011. (accelerating criminal justice).\n\nMiklós Hagyó’s case has already been used by the politic in Hungary three times: the former politician was the symbol of corruption both in the national and the local elections in 2010. The only basis was a confession of a witness which was withdrawn since then. CÖF, the “civil” organization attached to the administration “advertised” the left-wing before the national elections of 2014 with posters in which Hagyó as a criminal was illustrated in the company of former prime ministers and party chairmen. There is no doubt that Hagyó’s case shall be used during the local elections in autumn. Furthermore, the restarted trial before the Kecskemét Tribunal will not give a quick end for sure since it is a very complex case indeed. Supposedly the right-wing will use Hagyó’s case even in the national elections of 2018 to blacken the political counter-party.\n\nWe do not know how the court considers but it is a fact that Zsolt Balogh eventually withdrew his confession in October, 2012. “I am not a hero. I did not want anything else but to go home” – he confessed the reason why he gave an interview to Magyar Nemzet daily and HÍR TV, the home media of FIDESZ. As he told the court he was forced by the police to tell stories about the NOKIA box in order to remain at large.\n\nHe is married. His wife is Beáta Csecserits. They have a daughter, Dorina.\n\nHagyó completed the pilgrimage on El Camino de Santiago.\n\n- A (from the scope of basic constitutional rights) special case?\n\n- BKV case- are they represented fairly according to the statutory right of the court?\n\n- The legend of the Nokia-box and the pure truth\n\n"}

In 2009, he had to book a plane ticket to Berlin, which he found very difficult and frustrating. On his way back to Greece from the trip, he began planning on launching an online travel agency. Soon afterwards, he founded AirFastTickets with an initial capital of €100,000. The company bought tickets in bulk from scheduled flights and then sold the tickets at discounted prices. AirFastTickets partnered with Groupon, which allowed it to sell a huge quantity of tickets with low marketing costs.\n\nThe company opened its London office in 2012, and its office in New York City. Due to the extremely low prices the company offered for tickets, many Greek electronic travel agencies filed lawsuits against AirFastTickets for unfair competition practices. In 2013, the company was awarded for the most rapidly developed SME by the Athens Chamber of Commerce and Industry. In 2014, the company was in the news for offering Justin Bieber free tickets to travel anywhere outside the US due to Bieber's issues with the US authorities including a DUI. The company also offered free to tickets to him for as long as he stayed out of the US.\n\nDue to an increased volume of sales and the high cost of developing a software, Koklonis defaulted on €45 million payment to IATA. In 2014, IATA closed the UK subsidiary of the company as well as the Greek office. Koklonis began discussions with IATA and said that the company would clear its payments. In September 2015, the company entered bankruptcy and was liquidated in October.

The primary nature of data mining, analysis and extrapolation have their roots in game theory, rule of inference and regression models. Predictive Buying is an integration of predictive analytics and the methods of permission marketing.\n\nWhile direct marketing and content-relevant ads have expanded the personalized nature of individual consumer's experiences and communication with businesses, predictive buying intelligence bridges between consumers and the products they want. Even if the consumer does not know of a product's existence, predictive buying technology can, through an analysis of the consumer's interactions, purchase history and other factors, bring that product to the consumer’s attention.\n\nWhile many products are relevant, there will never be a perfect match every time, just as there isn’t always a perfect match with human intelligence when buying a product. This condition is especially true when the predictive buying analysis is based on limited data sets.\n\nThe future for predictive buying however is unlikely to be impeded by limited data sets. Trends in increased internet usage, the widespread popularity of social media and the data which can be obtained from an online merchant's website optimization analysis add daily to the diversity of data sources which can be mined, analyzed and extrapolated to accurately predict the products an individual is willing to purchase. Data sets are dramatically augmented when consumers give permission to examine the content of all of their related social media, trusting the exchange will provide for a better purchasing experience.\n\nPredictive buying is an applied derivative of Artificial Intelligence which may have some of its earliest roots manifest in Greek mythology. Consider Hephaestus and Pygmalion which used the concept of intelligent robots (such as Talos). Through the years, there have been many advances in the philosophy of intelligent programming, but in 1945, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern introduced the Game Theory which introduced artificial intelligence. Vannevar Bush followed up later that year with an article in July 1945 in The Atlantic Monthly titled As We May Think focusing on a vision of future computers assisting humans in many activities.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1951 that the first AI programs were actually written by Christopher Strachey and Dietrich Prinz to run on the Ferranti Mark1 machine of the University of Manchester to play checkers and chess.\n\nIn the 1990s data mining became a key development which eventually led to behavior-based robotics, such as with Polly, the first robot to navigate using vision and operate at animal-like speeds.\n\nIn 2005, recommendation technology based on tracking web activity or media usage brought artificial intelligence to marketing.\n\nTiVo Suggestions and Pandora have pioneered predictive consumer behavior based on history and algorithmic processing.\n\nWebsites such as Amazon.com, @WalmartLabs and Imply Labs utilize predictive buying intelligence to recommend relevant products to consumers based on social media usage.\n"}

He is the former governor of Ruhengeri prefecture in northwestern Rwanda. He has also been accused of collaborating in the 1994 Rwandan genocide and the 1985 murder of Dian Fossey.\n\nBetween 1974 and 1989 Zigiranyirazo served as governor of Ruhengeri. An ethnic Hutu, he was well-connected to the Hutu establishment of politicians, businessmen and military officers which then controlled Rwanda: he is the brother of Agathe Kanziga, wife of the late Rwandan president Juvénal Habyarimana, whose assassination on 6 April 1994 precipitated the events leading to the genocide.\n\nIn 1989 he resigned his position as prefect to study at the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He was expelled from UQAM and from Canada in 1993 after being convicted of uttering death threats against two Tutsi refugees in Montreal, who \"accused him of participating in the planning of ethnic massacres.\" \n\nZigiranyirazo returned to Rwanda following his expulsion from Canada. The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) has accused him of committing several crimes during the months of the genocide in 1994. Specifically, ICTR alleges that Zigiranyirazo \"ordered or authorized roadblocks to be established in direct proximity to each of his three residences ... knowing and intending that they would be used in the campaign of extermination and killing.\"\n\nFurther \"Protais Zigiranyirazo further instructed men at the roadblock to kill all Tutsi that attempted to pass through. Shortly thereafter, and on a continuing basis, soldiers and \"Interahamwe\" killed a number of people in their homes and killed people identified as Tutsi that attempted to pass through the roadblock.\"\n\nFrom sometime after 1994 until July 2001 Zigiranyirazo resided in Nairobi, Kenya. On 21 July 2001 he was arrested in a Brussels airport and seeking asylum in Belgium. On 4 October 2001 the Belgian government handed him over to the ICTR.\n\nOn his initial appearance before the court in October 2001 he was charged with two counts of crimes against humanity. The indictment against him was, however, amended pending his second appearance on 25 November 2003. The amended indictment accuses him of committing genocide against Tutsis between April and July 1994 in Kigali and Gisenyi. Trial Chamber III composed of Judges Inés Mónica Weinberg de Roca, Khalida Rachid Khan and Lee Gacuiga Muthoga, on Thursday 18 December 2008, convicted Protais Zigiranyirazo of genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity and sentenced him to 20 years imprisonment. Credit was given to him for time spent in prison. The verdict was overturned by the Appeal chamber of the ICTR who acquitted him of all charges on 16 November 2009, ordering the immediate release of Mr Zigiranyirazo and citing that the court has made serious errors in the initial judgement.\nZigiranyirazo's acquittal, which was partly based on the fact that he was not found to have engaged in \"genocide planning,\" has been criticized for giving credence to denial that the Rwandan genocide was planned by its perpetrators.\n\nBased on records, Protais Zigiranyirazo resigned and abandoned politics in 1989 and since then, he has never been involved in political activities which has influenced the acquittal decision.\n\n"}

Additionally, there must be some element of secrecy. Matters of public knowledge or of general knowledge in an industry cannot be the subject-matter of a trade secret.\n\nTrade secrets are a type of intellectual property that consists of certain information, expertise or knowhow that has been developed or acquired by firms. This knowledge frequently gives firms their competitive edge in the market and it has to be kept as a secret.\n\nIn Canada any information that a firm or its employees produces or acquires for the purpose of the firm’s business can constitute confidential information that courts are willing to protect. All that is required is that the creator of the information “has used his brain and thus produced a result which can be produced by somebody who goes through the same process”.\n\nAccording to \"Seager v. Copydex Ltd\", courts will even act to protect a comparatively underdeveloped idea from misappropriation. However, information may stop being confidential and confident may be released from its obligations of confidence if the information subject to confidence is later publicly disclosed by the confider or a third party.\n\nWith one exception in the field of employer-employee relations, there is no recognized distinction in Canada between the rights and remedies afforded to trade secrets as opposed to mere confidential information. In the field of employer-employee relationships, the British case \"Faccenda Chicken Ltd. v. Fowler\", which has been cited with approval by several Canadian courts, has drawn a distinction between the two.\n\nUnder the \"Constitution Act 1867\", the exclusive Legislative Authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to most areas of intellectual property such as patents, trademarks and copyrights; whereas the provincial government has exclusive authority to legislate on matters related to property and civil rights. The federal Parliament also has exclusive jurisdiction to create offences under its criminal law power.\n\nAt one time, the federal \"Trade-marks Act\" prohibited anyone from \"do[ing] any other act or adopt[ing] any other business practice contrary to honest industrial or commercial usage in Canada,\" which was considered to include the taking of trade secrets. However, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in \"MacDonald v. Vapor Canada Ltd.\" that the provisions encroached on the provinces' authority over property and civil rights and could not be upheld under the federal trade and commerce power. Therefore, the regulation of trade secrets as a civil matter falls under provincial jurisdiction.\n\nThe \"Uniform Trade Secrets Act\", adopted by the Uniform Law Conference of Canada in 1989, would provide civil remedies for the breach of trade secrets. That Uniform Act defines \"trade secrets\" as follows:\n\nTo date, the Uniform Act has not been enacted into law by any of the Legislatures, but the definition has been incorporated in the federal \"Security of Information Act\".\n\nIn all the provinces but Quebec, trade secrets are governed by the common law, ultimately derived from the English common law as interpreted and applied in Canada. The Canadian definition of trade secret is based on Canadian case law and doctrine, and also draws on American and English case law. In \"Lac Minerals Ltd. v. International Corona Resources Ltd.\", the Supreme Court of Canada held that a breach of confidence action is \"sui generis\" and the courts may rely on all three traditional jurisdictional bases for action (contract, equity and property) to enforce the policy of the law that confidences are to be respected.\n\nIn common law, there are essentially five types of civil action that a trade secret holder can rely on to seek protection of its trade secrets before a court of justice:\n\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada stated in \"Cadbury Schweppes Inc. v. FBI Foods Ltd.\" that all these types of actions coexist in the Canadian judicial system and remain available to the trade secret holder.\n\nIn Quebec, trade secrets are governed by provisions under the \"Civil Code of Quebec\". An action for breach of trade secrets or confidential business information generally arises either from a contractual liability action or, in the absence of a contract, from a civil liability action.\n\nThe \"Code\" deals specifically with trade secrets in one article that provides for a defense where disclosing the secret is in the public interest, and in one that describes how a loss resulting from disclosure is to be calculated. However, none of its provisions define the concept of trade secret.\n\nThe Quebec Court of Appeal has ruled in \"Continental Casualty Company v. Combined Insurance Company\" that those who own trade secrets (\"secrets de commerce\") are entitled to seek protection and that Quebec courts are competent to grant remedies in the case the plaintiff can evidence its ownership of them.\n\nTwo important forms of contract used by employers in Canada to protect their trade secrets and confidential information are non-disclosure agreements and non-competition agreements, which are also known as confidentiality agreements and restrictive covenants.\n\nAccording to \"Faccenda Chicken Ltd. v. Fowler\", ex-employees, post-termination, may use their general skills and knowledge anywhere but they may not use or divulge their former employer’s trade secrets. Exceptionally, ex-employers may also be able to enjoin a former employee’s use of non-trade secret information where that information has been obtained from records which qualify as trade secrets.\n\nAccording to \"International Tools Ltd. v. Kollar\", in Canada the length of a permanent injunction to force a defendant to cease using the plaintiff’s information should not normally extend beyond the time that the plaintiff’s trade secrets remains a secret which is exclusively known to the plaintiff and its confidants.\n\nIn \"Cadbury Schweppes Inc. v. FBI Foods Ltd.\" Justice Binnie concluded that the form of relief for breach of confidence was “dictated by the facts of the case rather than strict jurisdictional or doctrinal considerations”. He also stated that “whether a breach of contract in a particular case has a contractual, tortuous, proprietary or trust flavour goes to the appropriateness of particular equitable remedy but does not limit the court’s jurisdiction to grant it”.\n\nIn \"R. v. Stewart\", the Supreme Court of Canada held that the taking of confidential information cannot form the basis of a charge of theft under the \"Criminal Code\", but it could in certain circumstances form one for fraud:\n\nParliament has since amended the \"Security of Information Act\" to provide that it is an offence to:\n\nfor the benefit of a foreign economic entity, and to the detriment of Canada’s economic interests, international relations or national defence or national security.\n\n"}
{"id": "29354893", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29354893", "title": "Uninsured employer", "text": "Uninsured employer\n\nUninsured employer in the United States is a term to identify an employer of workers under circumstances where there is no form of insurance in place to provide certain benefits to those workers. More specifically, it is a term used in workers’ compensation law to identify an employer who does not have some form of worker’s compensation insurance or self-insurance coverage in effect at the time of, or during the time of, a claimed injury.\n\nAll States require that employers provide injury benefits coverage to their employees. These benefits are called workers’ compensation insurance coverage. This kind of coverage is to be distinguished from liability coverage, which covers the premises and the owner/occupier of the space from claims made by non-employees for injuries on the premises. It is also to be distinguished from health insurance, which covers only medical bills for non-work incurred conditions.\n\nProtection can be accomplished through a traditional insurance policy for workers’ compensation coverage. Coverage can also be accomplished by way of compliance with various State self-insurance laws (usually reserved for larger employers) requiring substantial bonding and self-funding. For example, public agencies are usually permissibly self-insured.\n\nWhen the employer has no specific insurance, or arrangement for the provision of workers’ compensation benefits to injured employees, the employer is then referred to as an uninsured employer.\n\nThis status is highly negative one in most States and often deemed a crime under State law. When there are no funds available to cover the benefits, and resulting bills for such benefits, the State usually steps in and provides the funding; hence the State’s interest in making the failure to have coverage both legally and financially painful. Most often this involves complete repayment to the State, fines, penalties, business closure, and the loss of legal defenses. The seriousness of the status by the uninsured employer is often underestimated due to unfamiliarity with the system and the belief that, like automobile uninsured motorist law, a quick settlement can be made by the uninsured for a modest amount to end the process. This is contrary to State law and recent studies in California have shown that for 2009 average claim cost is upwards of $60,000 and continually rising.\n\nMost often US states set aside fund to pay claims to injured workers under certain circumstances. Below are some examples:\n\nTwo special funds pay claims to injured workers under certain circumstances.\n\n\n\nThe New York State Workers' Compensation Board's Bureau of Compliance oversees uninsured claims. The Uninsured Employers Fund (UEF) is the funding mechanism for compensation and medical payments to injured employees whose employer was not properly insured at the time of the accident.\n\nThe risks to an uninsured employer are many, and can threaten the continued existence and viability of the firm. These risks include:\n\n\nWhile an uninsured employer does face a real problem, such as a prospective fine, prosecution, or employee injury, or is actually sued, there are steps the employer can take to minimize the consequences. Several established law firms can represent the employer in all administrative hearings and appeals, and advise the employer how to proceed. The goal for the uninsured employer is not only to achieve resolution to the immediate problem, but also to protect the assets of the firm, and to reach an accommodation with the regulatory agencies that enables the company to go forward in compliance with the law. The Uninsured Employer Benefit Trust Fund in CA does not have funding or staff to mitigate the value of an uninsured claim. UEBTF merely pays the claim and all costs as claimed by the Applicant/Plaintiff, and assesses the cost against the uninsured employer. If legal counsel is retained by the uninsured employer, there is at least opportunity to mitigate the value/reimbursement to UEBTF. Additionally, legal counsel can sometimes mitigate the administrative penalties, and negotiate repayment plans that allow the business to continue.\n\n"}
