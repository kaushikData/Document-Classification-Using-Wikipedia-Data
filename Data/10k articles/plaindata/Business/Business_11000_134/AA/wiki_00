Designed by Philip Johnson, it was formerly the headquarters of Sony Corporation of America. The tower was purchased by the Olayan Group and Chelsfield for $1.4 billion in 2016.\n\nThe building was designed by architect Philip Johnson and partner John Burgee and was completed in 1984. It is close – in concept – to the 1982 Humana Building by Michael Graves. It became immediately controversial for its ornamental top (sometimes mocked as \"Chippendale\", after the open pediments characteristic of the famous English designer's bookcases and other cabinetry), but enjoyed for its spectacular arched entrance way, measuring about seven stories in height. With these ornamental additions, the building challenged architectural modernism's demand for stark functionalism and purely efficient design. The effect the building had on the public at large has been described as legitimizing the postmodern architecture movement on the world stage. In July 2018 it was designated a New York City landmark by the Landmarks Preservation Commission.\n\nIn October 1978, AT&T was granted permission to add , the equivalent of some four floors of space on its proposed building, in exchange for agreeing to provide open public space and a three-story communications museum. The firm was granted an additional , about two floor's worth, as a bonus for creating a covered arcade along Madison Avenue that would include seating and retail kiosks.\nIn 1982, with the Bell System divestiture set to take effect on January 1, 1984, AT&T decided to seek a tenant to lease of space on the 7th through 25th floors, nearly half the space in the building, and was seeking rents of as much as $60 per square foot. The company had expected to relocate as many as 1,500 employees, most who had been located at the company's old headquarters at 195 Broadway, but the impending divestiture meant it would only be moving 600 employees into 550 Madison, with others being moved to another facility in Basking Ridge, New Jersey.\n\n\"Spirit of Communication\", a bronze statue that had stood for 64 years at the top of AT&T's previous headquarters building at 195 Broadway, was disassembled and relocated to the lobby of 550 Madison in 1983. The figure, modeled in 1916 by American sculptor Evelyn Beatrice Longman, is holding bolts of electricity clutched in one arm reaching towards the sky and has coils of cable wound around the statue's torso. After AT&T moved out of the building, the statue was relocated to a spot outside of its Basking Ridge operational headquarters in 1992. In 2009, the statue was relocated to AT&T's current corporate headquarters in Dallas.\n\nIn 1984, the company indicated that it would not build the museum that it had originally committed to build in exchange for bonus zoning. The change of heart came as part of plans following the court-ordered divestiture of the Regional Bell Operating Companies and the reduced presence it expected to have at the building. In the face of firm opposition from the city, AT&T acquiesced to construction of a three-story exhibition space in an annex located adjoining the pedestrian walkway behind the building.\nAT&T had been granted a tax break of $42 million, under the condition that the company would keep its headquarters at 550 Madison Avenue and not rent out the space to other tenants. Having decreased in size substantially, AT&T signed a 20-year lease agreement on 550 Madison with Sony and relocated its headquarters to 32 Sixth Avenue, between Walker and Lispenard Streets. Sony was granted an option to purchase the building. AT&T returned $14.5 million to New York City to compensate it for tax abatements made as part of a 1987 renegotiation.\n\nIn 1992, Sony submitted plans that required approval by the New York City Planning Commission, in which it would take some of the open space in the building's atrium that had been used to obtain approval for additional floors on top of the building, and convert those areas into retail space. In exchange, the company would expand the glass-enclosed pedestrian walkway with the addition of planters and public seating. Sony expected that the proposed conversion of the of public space could be converted into stores that could be leased at rates that \"The New York Times\" estimated could approach $200 per square foot. The company noted that the space was underutilized as a public amenity because it was \"dark, windy and noisy\" and that its conversion to commercial space would provide \"retail continuity\" with the remainder of Madison Avenue.\n\nBy 1996, Sony had consolidated most of the operations for its Sony Music Entertainment division at 550 Madison Avenue, for which \"The New York Times\" noted that \"such high-profile and elaborate space is appropriate and necessary.\" That same year, Sony acquired additional space across the street at 555 Madison Avenue, a building built in the 1960s that underwent renovations of its lobby, windows, bathrooms and other common spaces in conjunction with Sony's lease. Sony signed leases through 2013 on an additional on the sixth through ninth floors of the building, on top of an initial rental of of space on the second through fifth floors of the building that it had made in 1995. Rents on the floors had averaged about $34 per square foot at the time. Sony connected the two buildings using fiber optic cables that were run under Madison Avenue and installed microwave communications equipment on the top of the 555 building. Sony made these moves, which included early termination of leases on space in the surrounding area at 711 Fifth Avenue on the 43rd floor at 9 West 57th Street, as part of an effort to lower occupancy costs by bringing its businesses closer together.\n\nA cash-strapped AT&T sold the building to Sony in 2002 for $236 million, or $315 per square foot.\n\nThe building incorporated the Sony Wonder Technology Lab, a multimedia hands-on tour through the world of media, located in a four-story annex accessible through a glass-roofed atrium that connects 55th and 56th Streets in mid-block. It was open on Tuesdays through Saturdays, and Sony described the free exhibits as a \"technology and entertainment museum for all ages\". During 2008, the museum's third and fourth floors underwent renovations that were completed in fall 2008. Sony Wonder replaced Infoquest Center, a permanent telecommunications exhibition that had been built by AT&T. Sony permanently closed the lab on January 29, 2016.\n\nOn February 27, 2010, an accumulation of ice from the February 25–27, 2010 North American blizzard broke loose from an upper floor, breaking the glass ceiling of the atrium and injuring at least 15 inside who were attending a Purim celebration.\n\nIn December 2012, bidding started on the building and in January 2013 Sony announced plans to sell the building to the Chetrit Group for $1.1 billion – $685 million more than it had paid for it. Sony leased back its offices there through 2016, when it moved its headquarters south to 11 Madison Avenue.\n\nThe Chetrit Group planned to redevelop the building as a combination of condominiums and a hotel. Chetrit abandoned this plan and sold the building to Olayan and Chelsfield in 2016, relinquishing the \"Sony Tower\" name. Olayan and Chelsfield have announced plans to rebrand the building and reconfigure the existing space. Other than a ground floor restaurant, the building is currently empty.\n\nIn late October 2017, the Olayan Group announced its plans for a large renovation of the building, with the architectural firm Snøhetta to design the changes. The firm plans a glass curtain wall over the street front and plans to replace a glass arcade and annex building with an outdoor garden. Several architecture critics, architects, artists, and others voiced their opposition to the plans.\n\nA November protest and the petition, organized by Starship Chicago and The Absent Column filmmaker Nathan Eddy, drew widespread media coverage. A week later, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission announced it would vote to decide whether or not to calendar the building for landmark status consideration. \n\nOn November 27, the LPC voted unanimously to put the building on its calendar, though a specific date has not been set. Despite efforts to preserve the tower's architecture and significant interiors, demolition of the building's original ground floor lobby began in January 2018. \n\nThe protests and ensuing debate landed the building on the list of the most controversial architecture stories of 2017.\n\nOn July 31, 2018, the LPC voted unanimously to designate the entire exterior of the building a New York City landmark,http://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/2600.pdf less than a year after the protests for its protection began. \n\nEddy described the landmarking as \"an astonishing and marvelous victory\".\n\nThe Sony Tower appears in the original Spider-Man game \"Spider-Man (2000 video game)\" in the first level of the game. as well as in the 2002 video game, \"Spider-Man: The Movie,\" in the level \"Oscorp's Gambit\". This is probably because Sony owns the rights to Spider-Man. The tower later appears in the game's sequel, \"Spider-Man 2,\" as a building in the free-roaming Manhattan map. It also appears in \n\"Marvel's Spider-Man (2018 video game) in the free roam. \n\nIt is also featured in the movie \"Wall Street\", both as general office space (James Spader) and the CEO office (Michael Douglas as Gordon Gekko).\n\nhttp://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/2600.pdf\n\n"}

It was signed by Robert Horne, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leonid Krasin, Commissar of Foreign Trade. Lenin's New Economic Policy downplayed socialism and emphasized business dealings with capitalist countries, in an effort to restart the sluggish Russian economy. Britain was the first country to accept Lenin's offer of a trade agreement. It ended the British blockade, and Russian ports now were open to British ships. Both sides agreed to refrain from hostile propaganda. It amounted to de facto diplomatic recognition and opened a period of extensive trade.\n\nLloyd George first raised the proposal to drop the blockade on Russia, following the October Revolution at a meeting of the Allied Supreme Council, held on 14 January 1920, four days after the Treaty of Versailles had been ratified. Originally trade was to be restricted to being with the \"Russian people\", through Centrosoyuz, the All-Russian Union of Consumer Co-operative Societies. However, by the end of May 1920, Leonid Krasin had arrived in London and the terms of the agreement had shifted. Also, although originally an \"allied\" proposal, the French declined Lord Curzon's invitation to participate, and the Italians sent a chargé d'affaires who only participated in one session. Meanwhile, the Bolsheviks, upon hearing of the Supreme Council's intention of lifting of the blockade and developing trade with the Co-operatives, responded by taking Centrosoyuz over. Lenin wrote the executive decree promulgated by the Council of People's Commissars on 27 January which put this into effect. Krasin and his fellow delegates were nominally co-opted on to the board of Centrosoyuz, \nmaintaining the fiction that negotiations were being carried out with the Co-operatives Union.\n\nKrasin was accompanied by Viktor Nogin to London to engage in the negotiations. The British Cabinet discussed the proposed agreement at 10 Downing Street on 28 May 1920. Lord Curzon had previously briefed the meeting:\n\nThere were four meetings held on 31 May, 7 June, 16 June, and 29 June. The first two were more formal, but the third meeting consisted only of Lloyd George, Krasin, Sir Robert Horne, Philip Kerr, 11th Marquess of Lothian and Fridtjof Nansen. However, the last meeting was to prove crucial. Both Krasin and Lloyd George agreed that there were two principal issues:\n\nFaced with an impending meeting with Britain's allies, Lloyd George drew up a four-point plan:\nKrasin was given 7 days in which to reply and provided passage on board HMS Vimiera to Reval. Georgy Chicherin responded on 7 July agreeing to these terms in principle.\n\nLev Kamenev was appointed the head of the new negotiating team at Chicherin's insistence over Lenin's objections.\n\nNegotiations were long and protracted. Lenin remarked at the 8th All Russian Congress of Soviets on 21 December 1920:\n\nIvan Maisky was to underline the importance of the agreement thus:\n\n\n"}

He is one of Australia's best-selling authors, notable for his book \"The Power of One\".\n\nArthur Bryce Courtenay was born in the Lebombo Mountains, South Africa, the son of Maude Greer and Arthur Ryder. Ryder was married with six children, and lived with his family, but also maintained a relationship with Greer, with whom he already had a daughter, Rosemary. Maude Greer gave the surname Courtenay to both her children. Bryce Courtenay spent most of his early years in a small village in the Lebombo Mountains in the Limpopo province. He later attended King Edward VII School.\n\nIn 1955, while studying journalism in London, Courtenay met his future wife, Benita Solomon, and they emigrated to Sydney in 1958. They married in 1959 and had three sons – Brett, Adam and Damon.\n\nCourtenay entered the advertising industry and, over a career spanning 34 years, was the Creative Director of McCann Erickson, J. Walter Thompson and George Patterson Advertising. His award-winning campaigns included \"Louie the Fly\" and the original \"Milkybar Kid\" commercial.\n\nAlong with Geoff Pike, Bryce Courtenay developed the concept behind the Cadbury Yowie, a chocolate that contained a children's toy, typically an Australian or New Zealand native animal.\n\nOn 1 April 1991, Damon (who was born with the blood condition haemophilia) died at age 24 from AIDS-related complications, contracted through a blood transfusion.\n\nCourtenay divorced Benita in 2000 and acknowledged sexual relationships with other women during their 42-year marriage. Benita Courtenay died on 11 March 2007, at the age of 72, four months after being diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia. He later lived in Canberra with his second wife, Christine Gee.\n\nHis novels are primarily set in Australia, his adopted country, or South Africa, the country of his birth. His first book, The Power of One, was published in 1989 and, despite Courtenay's fears that it would never sell, quickly became one of Australia's best-selling books by any living author. The story was made into a film, as well as being re-released in an edition for children.\n\nCourtenay was one of Australia's most commercially successful authors. He built up this success over the long term by promoting himself and developing a relationship with readers as much as marketing his books; for instance, he gave away up to 2,500 books free each year to readers he met in the street. However, only \"The Power of One\" has been published in the United States. Courtenay claimed that this was because \"American publishers for the most part have difficulties about Australia, they are interested in books in their own country first and foremost. However, we receive many e-mails and letters from Americans who have read my books and I am hoping in the future that publishers will recognize that there is a market for all my books in the U.S.\"\n\nIn September 2012, Courtenay announced that he was suffering from terminal gastric cancer and that his last book would be \"Jack of Diamonds\". He died on 22 November at his Canberra home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

O'Higgins in 1991, which proposes that an investor annually select for investment the ten Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) stocks whose dividend is the highest fraction of their price.\n\nSelecting some components of the DJIA is not a new idea. An article by H. G. Schneider was published in \"The Journal of Finance\" in 1951, based on selecting stocks by their price–earnings ratio.\n\nProponents of the Dogs of the Dow strategy argue that blue-chip companies do not alter their dividend to reflect trading conditions and, therefore, the dividend is a measure of the average worth of the company; the stock price, in contrast, fluctuates through the business cycle. This should mean that companies with a high yield, with a high dividend relative to stock price, are near the bottom of their business cycle and are likely to see their stock price increase faster than low-yield companies.\n\nUnder this model, an investor annually reinvesting in high-yield companies should out-perform the overall market. The logic behind this is that a high-dividend yield suggests both that the stock is oversold and that management believes in its company's prospects and is willing to back that up by paying out a relatively high dividend. Investors are thereby hoping to benefit from both above-average stock-price gains as well as a relatively high quarterly dividend. Of course, several assumptions are made in this argument.\n\nThe first assumption is that the dividend price reflects the company size rather than the company business model. The second is that companies have a natural, repeating cycle in which good performances are predicted by bad ones. Due to the nature of the concept, the Dogs may come from a small number of sectors. For example, the ten stocks that belonged to the 2015 Dogs of the Dow list came from only six sectors, including industrials, energy, and healthcare, in contrast to the S&P 500 Index which covers eleven sectors.\n\nO'Higgins and others back-tested the strategy as far back as the 1920s and found that investing in the Dogs consistently outperformed the market as a whole. Since that time, the data shows that the Dogs of the Dow as well as the popular variant, the Small Dogs of the Dow, have performed well.\n\nFor example, for the twenty years from 1992 to 2011, the Dogs of the Dow matched the average annual total return of the DJIA (10.8 percent) and outperformed the S&P 500 (9.6 percent), as reported by the Dogs of the Dow website located at dogsofthedow.com.\n\nThe Small Dogs of the Dow, which are the five lowest-priced Dogs of the Dow, outperformed both the Dow and S&P 500 with an average annual total return of 12.6 percent.\n\nWhen each individual year is reviewed, it is clear that both the Dogs of the Dow and Small Dogs of the Dow did not outperform each and every year. In fact, the Dogs of the Dow and Small Dogs of the Dow struggled to keep up with the Dow during latter stages of the dot-com boom (1998 and 1999) as well as during the financial crisis (2007–2009). This suggests that an investor would be best served by viewing this as a longer-term strategy by giving this portfolio of stocks time to recover in case of a rare-but-extreme economic event (e.g., dot-com boom, financial crisis).\n\nOn January 8, 2014, John S. Tobey wrote an article in \"Forbes\" magazine where he criticized the Dogs. He said that it should use price weighting, instead of equal weighting, because that is what the DJIA uses. He said that, for the year 2013, using the price weighting the Dogs would have returned less, rather than more, than the DJIA. He suggested that it is too simple and it should use more factors such as dividend–payout ratio, growth of cash and earnings, price performance, and many other things. However, he did not say how to combine these into a strategy. He also criticized it for back-testing (although the method was published in 1991). He also said that the strategy would not work well for 2014.\n\n\n"}

An award of expectation damages protects the injured party's interest in realizing the value of the expectancy that was created by the promise of the other party.\n\nThe purpose of expectation damages is to put the non-breaching party in the position it would have occupied had the contract been fulfilled. Expectation damages can be contrasted to reliance damages and restitution damages, which are remedies that address other types of interests of parties involved in enforceable promises.\n\nThe default for expectation damages are monetary damages which are subject to limitations or exceptions (see below)\n\nExpectation damages are measured by the diminution in value, coupled with consequential and incidental damages.\n\nIn expectation damages, the measure of damages is the difference between what was given and what was promised, along with consequential and incidental expenses minus any payments received from the breaching party and any costs saved as a result of the breach. The proper amount is that which gives the non-breaching party the \"benefit of the bargain.\" However, it is important to note that expectation damages are not punitive; its theoretical purpose is to place the injured, non-breaching party in the same position that they would have occupied had there been full performance of the contract. In other words, it is the amount that makes the injured party indifferent to the breach.\n\nExamples: \n\n\n"}

As a prominent figure within the children's entertainment industry in the Benelux, he is regarded as a Belgian cultural icon, known for his influence and contributions to children' s entertainment in the Benelux and founder of Studio 100.\n\nVerhulst already knew on a very early age that he wanted to become famous (own words). In 1987 he applied at the \"Koninkijk Conservatorium Antwerpen\" (translated: The Royal Academy of fine Arts Antwerp) where he was rejected, he would recall this as a gift from Heaven. Later that year he got his first job at the former BRTN (now VRT) as continuity announcer.\n\nSamson & Gert is a Flemish children's television series produced by Eline van Noppen, centered on the talking dog Samson and his owner Gert. In its entire run, the show was originally aired on TV1 from Christmas Day 1989 until 1 December 1997, where it moved to Ketnet and continues airing all of its episodes to this day. As a continuity announcer Verhulst wanted to make the announcements before children's television programmes more appealing by having an animal puppet next to him. He got in touch with puppeteer Danny Verbiest, who created the puppet dog Samson. Samson, an Old English Sheepdog, made his screen debut on 2 September 1989. The pair's popularity grew very rapidly in Flanders and they were given their own television series in 1990. The show, named \"Samson\", premiered on 2 September 1990. During the show, Samson and Gert and their friends would encounter many funny and chaotic situations. The plot would be interrupted for contests, fan mail and a variety of cartoons, such as The Smurfs, Ovide and the Gang, and Mrs. Pepper Pot.\n\nVerhulst presented the language game \"Zeg eens Euh!\" (translated: Say Uh!) It was a game that was broadcast on Friday between 1992 and 1997 and whose concept was clearly inspired by the British radio game, \"Just a Minute\". The panelists alternately were given a theme that they had to talk about for one minute. Together with the theme they got a banned word that they could not use. In the panel were four Flemish celebrities including: \"Emiel Goelen\", \"Margriet Hermans\", \"Koen Crucke\" & \"Jaak Pijpen\". Occasionally one of these panelists was replaced by \"Mark Tijsmans\", \"Andrea Croonenberghs\", \"Walter Baele\" & \"Paul Ambach\". During the summer months, the viewer share rose from 700,000 to 800,000 viewers. When Verhulst moved to VTM, \"Donaat Deriemaecker\" took over the game but after a scandal involving one of the panel members, Emiel Goelen, the show was dismissed.\n\nIn 1997 Verhulst moved to VTM where he presented \"Wat zegt u?\" (translated: What do you say ?). This was followed by \"Linx\" and in the summer of 1998 Verhulst presented \"Sterrenslag\" (translated: Star battle) for several weeks because presenter 'Herbert Bruynseels' had had to withdraw due to illness. In the summer of 1999, the dialect game \"Watte ?\" (translated What?) started with the panel members: \"Walter De Donder\", \"Koen Crucke\" and \"Simonne Peeters\".\n\nVerhulst founded \"Studio 100\" in 1996 together with \"Danny Verbiest\", and \"Hans Bourlon\". They came together in 1989, when the programme \"Samson en Gert\" (translated \"Samson and Gert\") was first produced. Studio 100 started in 1996 with one program Samson en Gert. They immediately decided to create a new program to be able to advertise themselves more. They chose Kabouter Plop (translated Gnome Plop). It has been broadcast on VTM since 1997. In 1999, Studio 100 expanded significantly with four new projects, all launched in Flanders: a musical, a film, and two new television programmes. For both the musical and the film, Vtm was asked to provide financial support. In October of '99, Studio 100 and the VMMa (Vlaamse Media Maatschappij, founded in 1987 as Vlaamse Televisie Maatschappij by nine publishers each with an 11.1% share), announced that they would incorporate Meli Park. Right now Studio 100 features five Amusement parks in Belgium (\"Plopsaland De Panne\", Mayaland Indoor \"Plopsa Indoor\" Hasselt, \"Plopsa Coo\" and \"Plopsaqua\"), one in the Netherlands (\"Plopsa Indoor\" Coevorden) & one in Germany (Holiday Park) The headquarters of Studio 100 are located in Schelle and Londerzeel.

His daughter, Marie Verhulst, is also an actress. At the time of the musical \"Sleeping Beauty\" there where rumours that Verhulst was having a relationship with Karen Damen from the popular Girl group, K3. Verhulst always denied the relationship, but in February 2005, pictures of the couple appeared in a Dutch newspaper. In April the couple broke up, after a relationship of four years. From 2008 to 2011, Verhulst had a relationship with a restaurant owner from Blankenberge. In 2012 Verhulst had a very short relationship with Josje Huisman, also a singer from the popular Girl group, K3, but after a few months they split up.

He was the only son of Josep Plandolit Targarona and Maria Rosa Areny. He belonged to one of the most prominent Catalan families at the time, with a long industrial and commercial background that traces its origins back to the 17th century.\n\nHis mother died nine months after his birth, in September. Afterward, Josep and his son moved to Andorra, settling in Ordino where he eventually remarried. Josep died on 17 July 1843 aged 55 at the family estate after a long illness.\n\nIn 1841, at the age of 19, Areny-Plandolit married Maria Dolors Parella, Baroness of Senaller. They had seven children, five of whom survived to adulthood. \n\nTragedy struck on 19 June 1855, when his first wife was murdered at the age of 30 in Barcelona, where the family had property they frequently visited. Her attacker, Blas Durana Atauri, stabbed her 13 times in a carefully premeditated attack. The crime became well-known in 19th-century Barcelona and shocked the public at the time because of the status and personality of those involved and also for its bizarre aftermath.\n\nDurana was an infantry colonel in the Spanish Army and was stationed in Barcelona at the time. He frequently attended social gatherings where he attempted to climb the social ladder and court women. He soon caught wind of the Baroness and fell deeply in love with her. Parella initially welcomed and tolerated his compliments, but became alarmed when Durana began appearing at an increasing amount of the same gatherings, apparently not letting up. \nAfter complaining to her husband, Areny-Plandolit was annoyed enough to ask his friend, Captain General of Catalonia Juan Zapatero y Navas, for help. Zapatero agreed to redeploy Durana to Lugo in Galicia to mend the situation. Durana was able to continue his amorous siege by making up excuses and taking advantage of every opportunity to return to Barcelona, apparently still motivated by love. Fueled by frustration and envy, this feeling eventually turned into hatred. Desperate and embittered, he decided to kill Parella.\n\nDurana had spent the day of the attack carefully observing the Areny-Plandolit and Parella property, hiding in an alleyway on the opposite street. He attacked the Baroness at dusk when she finally came out of the house in order to visit a theater; she died within twenty minutes. As he did not attempt to flee, he was quickly captured by a local militia to whom he quickly identified himself and triumphantly admitted his crime. \n\nDurana's lawyer tried to argue that mental instability was to blame and referred to past incidents to prove this claim. However, he was quickly convicted and sentenced to be executed by garrotte. Although Durana remained calm and composed during the sentencing, the method of execution came unexpectedly since he had expected to be put in front of a firing squad, something more befitting a colonel. His request to change the method of execution was denied.\n\nDurana committed suicide on the eve of the execution by means of mercuric cyanide, likely smuggled in by an army comrade on an earlier visit to him in prison. Rumors had been going around that the trial had been a farce and that the colonel, as a result of his rank, would somehow be allowed to escape his fate. As a result, a large crowd had gathered on the morning of the execution to witness the event. To avoid a riot, authorities wheeled out his dead body and went through the motions of the execution; essentially executing his corpse.\n\nAreny-Plandolit was not present at the burial of his first wife and appears not to have mourned for long, if at all. He remarried a little more than three months later, to Carolina de Plandolit, his cousin. They had ten children.\n\nAndorra in the mid-19th century was a country in an economic crisis. Areny-Plandolit led the reforms to replace the aristocratic and oligarchical that previously ruled the state. The political system was largely governed based on the privileges of a small social group formed of traditional wealthy Andorran families, to whom his family also belonged. This type of oligarchical governance made it possible for them to control all the decisions made by the General Council of the Valleys, and to manage public resources as they pleased.\n\nWith a total estimated population of only 4,000 residents, whose economic power was growing and eventually even surpassing that of the original wealthy families, more and more voices were demanding social and political changes. The General Council reacted with a steady refusal and inaction. This led to a group of reformists led by Areny-Plandolit to organize meetings in order to discuss the best way to bring about reform.\nOn 22 April 1866, The New Reform () was decreed by the Episcopal Co-Prince, Bishop Josep Caixal i Estradé, and established the basis of the Andorran constitution and symbols (such as the tricolor flag) of Andorra. It was ratified three years later by Napoleon III.\n\nThe reforms had several effects. Most importantly, it gave every citizen of the country the right to vote. It also promised regular elections; in this case twelve of the twenty-four councilors were to be elected every two years, with a maximum post length of four years. There was also the creation of the position of town commissioner in order to control public spending and put a halt to the waste of resources.\n\nAfter producing the official document listing the reforms in May 1866, Areny-Plandolit was elected First Syndic of the General Council, a position akin to speaker.\n\n\nBooks\n\nNewspapers\nOnline\n"}

Soon after, in the 1890s, Guillermo was honored by the local governor, Luciano Leiva, for giving flour to the poor and contributing money to the local area to stimulate growth. After contributing to the health of many people and giving selflessly, he was honored by a reprographic shop in Rosario, and eventually met Pope Leo XIII, who was touched by his kindness.

Ferré\n\nDon Luis Alberto Ferré-Aguayo (February 17, 1904 October 21, 2003) was a Puerto Rican engineer, industrialist, politician, philanthropist, and a patron of the arts. He was the third Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, serving from 1969 to 1973. He was the founding father of the New Progressive Party, which advocates for Puerto Rico to become a state of the United States of America. He is a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nLuis Alberto Ferré-Aguayo was born in the southern city of Ponce, Puerto Rico on February 17, 1904. Ferré's grandfather Maurice Ferré Perotín was a French engineer who was involved in the construction of the Panama Canal before settling in Cuba. Ferre's father, Antonio Ferré Bagayado or \"Bacallao\", was born in Havana, Cuba and grew up there. As a young man he immigrated to Puerto Rico, where he founded the company Puerto Rico Iron Works, in Barrio Playa de Ponce, Ponce, Puerto Rico. In Puerto Rico Ferré met and married María Aguayo Casals, a cousin of Catalan cellist Pablo Casals, whose mother was a Puerto Rico-born Catalan musician. Antonio and María had four sons, Luis, José, Carlos and Hermán Ferré, and two daughters, Rosario and Isolina, this latter would became a nun of international prominence.\n\nFerré studied mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, obtaining his bachelor's degree in 1924 and master's degree in 1925, and music at the New England Conservatory of Music. During this time while living in Boston, Ferré developed an admiration for the \"American way of democracy\".\n\nUpon his return to Puerto Rico, Ferré helped transform his father's company into a successful business from which he earned a fortune. In 1948, he acquired \"El Día,\" a fledgling newspaper that was later renamed \"El Nuevo Día,\" becoming the newspaper with the largest circulation in Puerto Rico at the time. In the 1950s, Ferré's \"Empresas Ferré\" (Ferre Enterprises) acquired Puerto Rico Cement and Ponce Cement, which capitalized on the economic boom which Puerto Rico enjoyed based on the ambitious industrialization projects undertaken in association with the Operation Bootstrap. Ferré's brother, José, had moved to Miami with his family. His son Maurice expanded a successful business there, selling bagged pre-mixed cement and sand under the name Mezcla Lista. Maurice Ferré was elected Mayor of Miami.\n\nFerré became active in politics in the 1940s. He unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Ponce in 1940 and Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico in 1948.\n\nIn 1948, Puerto Ricans were allowed to elect their governor; previously the position was filled by appointment by the United States president. Luis Muñoz Marín was elected governor of Puerto Rico. A movement began which aimed to adopt a commonwealth relationship with the United States of America. In 1951, a referendum was held to decide whether to approve or not the option granted by the United States Congress to draft Puerto Rico's first constitution. Ferré abstained from participating in the process; the pro-statehood party to which he belonged favored the 1951 referendum. He believed that the process would mean \"an acceptance of a colony and condemn the people to a perpetual condition of second class citizenship\". Ferré later participated in the constitutional assembly created by the referendum, which drafted the constitution.\n\nIn 1952 the Constitution of Puerto Rico was adopted, renaming the body politic of the territory of Puerto Rico as the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Ferré was elected as a member of the Constitutional Assembly. That same year Ferré was elected representative in the Puerto Rico House of Representatives. He ran under the Republican Statehood Party (\"Partido Estadista Republicano) and officially assumed his duties as representative on January 11, 1953.\nOn July 23, 1967, a plebiscite was held to decide if the people of Puerto Rico desired to become an independent nation, a state of the United States of America, or continue the commonwealth relation established in 1952. The majority of Puerto Ricans opted for the Commonwealth option (see Puerto Rican status referendums). Disagreement among the current pro-statehood party led by Miguel A. García Méndez led Ferré and others to found the New Progressive Party or PNP.\n\nIn the following general election in 1968, Ferré ran for Governor and defeated Luis Negrón López, the candidate of the Popular Democratic Party (PPD) by a slight margin. The ruling party had split with the creation of the People's Party, which ran incumbent PDP-elected Governor Roberto Sánchez Vilella as its gubernatorial candidate, ending Luis Muñoz Marín's PPD's hold on the governor's seat, which had lasted 20 years.\n\nDuring Ferré's administration, Puerto Rico was in an economic boom at 7% GDP Growth and the unemployment at 10%, the lowest until 1999. His work as governor of Puerto Rico included defending the federal minimum wage and granting workers a Christmas bonus. He visited Puerto Rican troops in Vietnam. In 1970, his first wife, Lorencita, died at La Fortaleza after being bed-ridden for years. Their daughter, Rosario Ferré, an acclaimed novelist and writer, stepped into the role of First Lady.\n\nDuring his governorship, he paid special attention to youth affairs and bringing young Puerto Ricans into public service. He successfully had the Puerto Rico Constitution amended to lower the voting age to 18, strongly supported the New Progressive Party Youth organization as party president, and appointed then-young statehooders such as Antonio Quiñones Calderón and Francisco \"Pompi\" González to high-level administration jobs, campaigned for a 26-year-old at large House candidate, nominated a future Senate President and Secretary of State, teenager Kenneth McClintock as Puerto Rico delegate to the 1971 White House Conference on Youth, and strengthened college scholarship programs.\n\nBefore the Congress created the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 1971, Ferré had already created Puerto Rico's Environmental Quality Board in 1970, charged with protecting the islands' environment.\n\nIn the elections of 1972 he sought reelection but lost to Rafael Hernández Colón of the PPD. The PPD had claimed that many corruption scandals (rather minor compared to similar ones in the various administrations following Ferré's) had been overlooked by the Ferré administration. A bloody student strike at the University of Puerto Rico at Río Piedras in 1971 had been neutralized by the Puerto Rican police using brute force, something about which Ferré had mixed feelings. Hernández played the youth card in his campaign (when elected he was the youngest Puerto Rican governor). All these issues, along with the reunification of the People's Party and the PDP, contributed to a PDP win over Ferré in the election.\n\nFerré remained active in politics and in 1976, he was elected to the Senate of Puerto Rico. Ferré served as the eighth president of the Senate from 1977 to 1981 and continued serving as senator until 1985.\n\nYears after leaving La Fortaleza, he married Tiody De Jesús, a nurse who later became a physician.\n\nAfter serving as senator, Ferré continued to be active in politics, especially representing the United States Republican Party on the island. Between 1989 and 1991, Ferré served with former Governor Carlos Romero Barceló, former representative Benny Frankie Cerezo, PNP leader Kenneth McClintock and former congressional staffer David Gerken as the New Progressive Party's negotiating team while Congress considered Puerto Rico political status legislation introduced by Senator J. Bennett Johnston.\n\nFerré was also a talented pianist who recorded several albums of his piano music. On January 3, 1959 he founded the Museo de Arte de Ponce, in his hometown of Ponce. The museum initially displayed 71 paintings from his personal collection and today displays over 3,000 pieces. Among other things, Ferré is credited with having rescued from oblivion the painting \"Flaming June\" by the Victorian painter Frederic Lord Leighton – purchasing it in 1963, when it was considered \"too old fashioned\" and getting it prominently displayed at the Museo of Arte de Ponce.\n\n\"El Centro de Bellas Artes\", the center for performing arts in Santurce, Puerto Rico also bears his name, as well as the main highway connecting San Juan and Ponce. He also assisted in the creation of the Casals Festival and the Puerto Rico Conservatory of Music. He was a member of Phi Sigma Alpha Fraternity. As a sportsman, Ferré practiced fencing, and is honored annually with the \"Campeonato Nacional de Esgrima\" in Puerto Rico.\n\nHis philanthropic deeds and defense for democracy earned him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, awarded by President George H. W. Bush on November 18, 1991.\n\nOn September 29, 2003, Ferré was hospitalized with a urinary tract infection and underwent surgery for an intestinal blockage on October 1. While in the hospital he developed pneumonia before finally succumbing to respiratory failure on the morning of October 21, 2003.\n\nHis body lay in state in Puerto Rico's capitol building in San Juan, then transported to his museum in Ponce, before being taken for a state funeral and burial in that city. His funeral and ceremonies honoring him were attended by numerous politicians. He is interred at the Las Mercedes Cemetery in Ponce.\n\nAmong the awards that were bestowed on Luis A. Ferré was the Presidential Medal of Freedom, an honor which was also subsequently bestowed on his sister Sor Isolina Ferre. The sculptor Tomás Batista was also commissioned to make a bust of Ferré, which is exhibited in the Ponce Museum of Art. Another Tomás Batista bust of him was unveiled by his widow, Tiody, Senate President Kenneth McClintock and Senate Vice President Orlando Parga in February, 2008 at the Senate of Puerto Rico's Hall of Governors.\n\nIn 2003 the historic United States Courthouse and Post Office Building in Ponce, Puerto Rico was named the Luis A. Ferré United States Courthouse and Post Office Building by an Act of the U.S. Congress.\n\nThe segment of Las Américas Avenue that includes the Museo de Arte de Ponce and the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico was renamed the \"Luis A. Ferré Boulevard\" in November, 2010, in his honor.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3234871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3234871", "title": "Merger control", "text": "Merger control\n\nMerger control refers to the procedure of reviewing mergers , acquisitions under antitrust / competition law. Over 130 nations worldwide have adopted a regime providing for merger control. National or supernational competition agencies such as the EU European Commission or the US Federal Trade Commission are normally entrusted with the role of reviewing mergers.\n\nMerger control regimes are adopted to prevent anti-competitive consequences of concentrations (as mergers and acquisitions are also known). Accordingly, most merger control regimes normally provide for one of the following substantive tests:\n\n\nIn practice most merger control regimes are based on very similar underlying principles. In simple terms, the creation of a dominant position would usually result in a substantial lessening of or significant impediment to effective competition.\n\nThe large majority of modern merger control regimes are of an \"ex-ante\" nature, i.e. the reviewing authorities carry out their assessment before the transaction is implemented.\n\nWhile it is indisputable that a concentration may lead to a reduction in output and result in higher prices and thus in a welfare loss to consumers, the antitrust authority faces the challenge of applying various economic theories and rules in a legally binding procedure.\n\nThe vast majority of significant competition issues associated with mergers arises in horizontal mergers. A horizontal merger is one between parties that are competitors at the same level of production and/or distribution of a good or service, i.e., in the same relevant market.\n\nThere are two types of anticompetitive effects associated with horizontal mergers: unilateral effects and coordinated effects.\n\nUnilateral effects, also known as non-coordinated effects, arise where, as a result of the merger, competition between the products of the merging firms is eliminated, allowing the merged entity to unilaterally exercise market power, for instance by profitably raising the price of one or both merging parties’ products, thus harming consumers.\n\nIn homogeneous markets, unilateral effects can be pronounced when two significant competitors merge to create a large, dominant player with only a few or no other competitors. In these markets, an important role in the assessment is played by market shares and by the capacity available in the market. In differentiated markets, unilateral effects tend to arise particularly when the two merging companies have highly substitutable goods. Such a price increase does not depend on the merged firm being the dominant player in the market. The likelihood and magnitude of such an increase will instead depend on the substitutability of the products supplied by the two firms – the closer the substitute, the greater the unilateral effects.\n\nCoordinated effects arise where, under certain market conditions (e.g., market transparency, product homogeneity etc.), the merger increases the probability that, post merger, merging parties and their competitors will successfully be able to coordinate their behaviour in an anti-competitive way, for example, by raising prices. As in the case of unilateral effects, the most common form of coordinated effects is in the case of horizontal mergers, i.e. mergers between firms active on the same market.\n\nThe main question in analysing coordinated effects should be whether the merger materially increases the likelihood that firms in the market will successfully coordinate their behaviour or strengthen existing coordination. The task is to identify what factors are likely to lead to coordination taking place between firms post-merger. This was a controversial area with which competition authorities and courts have struggled to come to terms over the years, but experience has led to the emergence of some agreement on what conditions are most likely to give rise to coordinated effects.\n\nUnder the European Union merger control regime, in order for coordinated effects to arise the so-called \"Airtours criteria\" have to be fulfilled.\n\nAccording to the \"Airtours criteria\", coordination is more likely to emerge in markets where it is relatively simple to reach a common understanding on the terms of coordination. In addition, three conditions are necessary for coordination to be sustainable. First, the coordinating firms must be able to monitor to a sufficient degree whether the terms of coordination are being adhered to. Second, discipline requires that there is some form of credible deterrent mechanism that can be activated if deviation is detected. Third, the reactions of outsiders, such as current and future competitors not participating in the coordination, as well as customers, should not be able to jeopardise the results expected from the coordination.\n\nThere are two basic forms of non-horizontal mergers: vertical mergers and conglomerate mergers.\n\nVertical mergers are mergers between firms that operate at different but complementary levels in the chain of production (e.g., manufacturing and an upstream market for an input) and/or distribution (e.g., manufacturing and a downstream market for re-sale to retailers) of the same final product. In purely vertical mergers there is no direct loss in competition as in horizontal mergers because the parties' products did not compete in the same relevant market. As such, there is no change in the level of concentration in either relevant market. Vertical mergers have significant potential to create efficiencies largely because the upstream and downstream products or services complement each other. Even so, vertical integration may sometimes give rise to competition concerns.\n\nVertical effects can produce competitive harm in the form of foreclosure. A merger is said to result in foreclosure where actual or potential rivals' access to supplies or markets is hampered or eliminated as a result of the merger, thereby reducing these companies' ability and/or incentive to compete.\n\nTwo forms of foreclosure can be distinguished. The first is where the merger is likely to raise the costs of downstream rivals by restricting their access to an important input (input foreclosure). The second is where the merger is likely to foreclose upstream rivals by restricting their access to a sufficient customer base (customer foreclosure).\n\nHowever, it should be noted that in general vertical merger concerns are likely to arise only if market power already exists in one or more markets along the supply chain.\n\nConglomerate mergers involve firms that operate in different product markets, without a vertical relationship. They may be product extension mergers, i.e., mergers between firms that produce different but related products or pure conglomerate mergers, i.e., mergers between firms operating in entirely different markets. In practice, the focus is on mergers between companies that are active in related or neighbouring markets, e.g., mergers involving suppliers of complementary products or of products belonging to a range of products that is generally sold to the same set of customers in a manner that lessens competition.\n\nMerger review in this area is controversial, as commentators and enforcement agencies disagree on the extent to which one can predict competitive harm resulting from such mergers. Such a disagreement is for instance illustrated by the different outcomes of the merger control reviews by the authorities of the United States and the European Union of the GE/Honeywell merger attempt.\n\nProponents of conglomerate theories of harm argue that in a small number of cases, where the parties to the merger have strong market positions in their respective markets, potential harm may arise when the merging group is likely to foreclose other rivals from the market in a way similar to vertical mergers, particularly by means of tying and bundling their products. When as a result of foreclosure rival companies become less effective competitors, consumer harm may result.\n\nHowever, it should be stressed that in these cases there is a real risk of foregoing efficiency gains that benefits consumer welfare and thus the theory of competitive harm needs to be supported by substantial evidence.\n\nA merger control regime is described as \"mandatory\" when filing of a transaction is compulsory. Mandatory regimes normally also contain a so-called \"suspensory clause\", which implies that the parties to a transaction are indefinitely prevented from closing the deal until they have received merger clearance. The majority of merger jurisdictions worldwide have mandatory merger control systems. An examples of a mandatory system with suspensory clause is provided by the European Union merger control.\n\nA distinction can also be made between \"local\" and \"global\" bars on closing/implementation; some mandatory regimes provide that the transaction cannot be implemented within the particular jurisdiction (local bar on closing) and some provide that the transaction cannot be closed/implemented anywhere in the world prior to merger clearance (global bar on closing). A number of jurisdictions worldwide have a merger control regime which imposes a global bar on closing. This creates obstacles for the parties to a concentration to close a transaction until a number of the regulatory clearances required are obtained.\n\nA merger control regime is described as \"voluntary\" when the parties are not prevented from closing the deal and implementing the transaction in advance of having applied for and received merger clearance. In these circumstances the merging parties are effectively taking the risk that the competition authority will not require them to undo the deal if in due course it is found that the transaction is likely to have an anti-competitive effect. Voluntary regimes are fairly exceptional. The United Kingdom, for instance, has a voluntary merger control regime. However, the Office of Fair Trading can request the parties to a merger that has already completed to hold the two businesses separate pending an investigation (so called \"initial undertakings\").\n\nMandatory regimes can be considered effective in preventing anticompetitive concentrations since it is almost impossible to unravel a merger once it has been implemented (for example because key staff have been made redundant, assets have been sold and information has been exchanged). On the other hand, voluntary regimes are seen as constituting less of a burden for merging firms.\n\n\n"}

MiSK specifically focuses on four key areas: education, creative and digital media, technology, and culture and arts. It pursues this agenda both through its own programs, and through partnerships with local and global organisations.\n\nCreated in 2011, the MiSK foundation was initiated by Mohammad bin Salman, then advisor to the Governor of Riyadh. The foundation aims to increase economic opportunities in Saudi society, where seventy percent of the population is under the age of 30, in step with the Vision 2030 national restructuring plan.\n\nThe MiSK Foundation launched the Tweeps Forum in 2013, an annual networking event connecting the Saudi youth with social media leaders, gathering speakers such as Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Ivanka Trump, and top executives from Twitter.\n\nIn October 2015, the MiSK Foundation was one of the main partners of the 9th UNESCO Youth Forum in Paris. In September 2016, the two organisations signed a Framework Agreement to collaborate on the development of youth, education, emerging technologies, culture, and science. The 7th International Forum of NGOs was held in Riyadh in May 2017 in partnership with the MiSK foundation.\n\nThe MiSK Global Forum started in 2016 and was initially conceived as a two-day forum, with a focus on entrepreneurship and innovation. From 25 to 27 November 2016, the MiSK Hackathon connected more than 100 youths from London and Riyadh by satellite in a competition broadcast over two days.\n\nIn April 2017, the Foundation launched a campaign with Google named \"We Are All Online\", an initiative to share best practices in the promotion of online safety for Saudi youth, one of the most connected nations worldwide. In the same month, the Foundation became a member of the MIT Media Lab consortium.\n\nIn September 2017, the MiSK Foundation organised a New York-based youth-oriented forum, the MiSK-UNDP Youth Forum, that drew 400 participants and raised awareness on ways that Saudi and Arab youth could further involve themselves with the issues of counter extremism and the refugee crisis.\n\nIn November 2018, a month after the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation pulled funding to the foundation. The decision ended a joint initiative between the Gates Foundation and the MiSK Foundation called the \"MiSK Grand Challenges\", which made grants to organisations around the world working to create innovative solutions to development challenges. In 2017, the Gates Foundation had committed $5 million to the MiSK Grant Challenges. “Jamal Khashoggi’s abduction and murder are extremely troubling,” said the Gates Foundation in a statement.\n\nThe name of the Foundation comes from \"misk\" (\"musk\" in English). The symbolism is one of generosity and benevolence in that this ancient perfume is worn by one person, while simultaneously engulfing those around them.\n\nThe Foundation’s work is focused on education, culture and media. It provides contributions to youth development, with a spotlight on technology and the arts, in order to build a knowledge-based economy. The MiSK Foundation also tackles problems related to terrorism by convening events both in Saudi Arabia and internationally, including the annual Tweeps Forum and the MiSK UNDP Youth Forum.\n\nThe MiSK Art Institute, launched in 2017, is the artistic branch of the MiSK Foundation. The objective of the institute is to become the \"leading platform for grassroots cultural production, diplomacy and exchange\" in Saudi Arabia. Ahmed Mater serves as its executive director.\n\nIn early 2018, the Foundation announced the expansion of the MiSK Art Institute, including new galleries, creative spaces, meeting spaces, workshops, and educational programs. The Institute also included plans for a pavilion at the 2018 Venice Biennale, a New York Arab Art Festival, an exchange program with California.\n\n\n"}

The elder Rocca was an engineering apprentice who would later become a member of the board of directors of the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (IRI), the centerpiece of the corporate state advanced by Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini.\n\nDuring World War II, Roberto Rocca enlisted in the Italian Navy, serving from June 1942 until September 8, 1943, as a Second Lieutenant in Naval Engineering on board a submarine. He graduated as Mechanical Engineer at the Politecnico di Milano in July 1945, though seven months later, the family left Italy for Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nHis father's new establishment, Techint, prospered during the administration of populist President Juan Perón, and Rocca enrolled at MIT, earning a degree in science at the end of 1949.\n\nInvolved in Techint since its initial, 1945 establishment, Rocca served an engineer and in the company's technical department. He was named head of the technical department in 1959, and oversaw the company's expansion into the steel industry. He became General Manager of Techint at the end of 1969, and CEO upon his father's retirement in 1975.\n\nAgostino Rocca died in 1978, leaving his elder son as Chairman and CEO. Techint was, by then, a conglomerate with 15,000 employees, two steel manufacturing facilities in Argentina and with international engineering and construction interests. Buffeted by problems in the Argentine economy during the 1980s, Techint expanded its Latin American activities. \n\nTechint participated in the privatization drive adopted by President Carlos Menem in the early 1990s, purchasing a majority stake in Argentina's then-leading steel manufacturer, the state-owned , in 1992. Techint bids for two electric utilities serving the Buenos Aires area came in second, however. \n\nRocca converted Somisa into Siderar, and integrated Techint's cold rolled steel operations (for which Somisa had long been a leading supplier, reportedly at a loss to the state concern) into Siderca. Between 1992 and 1996 Siderar raised its share of domestic consumption of flat steel (used in major aplliances and the auto industry, among others) from about 56 percent to about 79 percent.\n\nRelinquishing the presidency of Techint to his elder son, Agostino, in 1993, he became president of Siderca in 1996, as well as of Dalmine, a steelmaker based in Bergamo, Italy, acquired in 1996 . Rocca embarked on a five-year investment program for Siderar, modernizing operations and shedding unprofitable units. Productivity almost tripled during this period, and costs per ton fell by 28 percent.\n\nSiderar was listed on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange in 1996. A further joint venture was entered into with Tamsa, in Mexico, and a controlling stake was purchased in Sidor (the leading steelmaker in Venezuela) in 1998, Confab (Brazil), in 1999, and in NKK (Japan), in 2000, making it the first Japanese steel company in foreign majority ownership.

Agostino's younger brother, Paolo Rocca, was appointed to the post.

They own a six-floor, $7 million townhome in Boston's Beacon Hill neighborhood, an ocean-front home on Nantucket recently listed for sale at $25 million, a $5 million ski retreat in Idaho, a $4 million estate in Fox Chapel, Pennsylvania, near the Heinz family's home base of Pittsburgh, and a $5 million home in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C.\n\nLike her first husband, Heinz was a registered Republican for most of her voting life, and she remained a registered Republican despite being married to Kerry. In January 2003, she changed her registration to the Democratic Party.\n\nIn 2003, Heinz was named to the PoliticsPA list of \"Pennsylvania's Most Politically Powerful Women\".\n\nHeinz is said to have been encouraged to run for her first husband's vacant Senate seat after his death. Heinz declined and refused to endorse Republican Congressman Rick Santorum's 1994 bid for the seat. She publicly denounced him as the \"antithesis\" of her late husband, and later called him \"Forrest Gump with attitude.\" It was rumored she would challenge Santorum in 2006 (as a Democrat), but she did not enter the race, and the Democratic nomination went to State Treasurer Bob Casey, Jr., who went on to defeat Santorum.\n\nHeinz has a reputation in the media as a very direct personality. In an interview published in \"USA Today\" in July 2004, Heinz was asked about the differences between then-First Lady Laura Bush and herself:\n\n\"Well, you know, I don't know Laura Bush. But she seems to be calm, and she has a sparkle in her eye, which is good. But I don't know that she's ever had a real job—I mean, since she's been grown up. So her experience and her validation comes from important things, but different things. And I’m older, and my validation of what I do and what I believe and my experience is a little bit bigger–because I’m older, and I’ve had different experiences. And it’s not a criticism of her. It’s just, you know, what life is about.\n\nHeinz retracted the statement later, saying she was \"sincerely sorry\" for the remark. \"I had forgotten that Mrs. Bush had worked as a schoolteacher and librarian, and there couldn't be a more important job than teaching our children\", Heinz said. \"As someone who has been both a full time mom and full time in the workforce, I know we all have valuable experiences that shape who we are. I appreciate and honor Mrs. Bush's service to the country as first lady, and am sincerely sorry I had not remembered her important work in the past.\"\n\nBush brushed it off, saying, \"It didn't matter to me. It didn't hurt my feelings. It was perfectly all right that she apologized. She didn't have to apologize. I know how tough it is. And actually I know those trick questions.\"\n\n"}

The fund, which had an initial $295 million investment, is used for ensuring the growth of business in Texas. One of Texas’ most competitive recruitment tools, these funds are used primarily to attract new business to the state or assist with the substantial expansion of an existing business as part of a competitive recruitment situation. Sources indicate that since 2003 the Fund has yielded up to $6.3 billion in capital investment in Texas by out-of-state companies .\n\nIn 2004, authorization was given for the fund to grant $20 million to Countrywide Financial in return for a promise \"to create 7,500 new jobs in the state by 2010.\" The grant (all of which are approved by the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor and Speaker of the House) is one of the largest made from the fund in terms of the size and the number of jobs promised. In the fall of 2007, while slashing jobs and with its stock price plummeting, Countrywide was eventually acquired in a fire sale by Bank of America. But thanks to the \"claw-back\" provisions in the program, grantees return all funds to the state for jobs not created.\n\nIn 2012, it was announced that Apple would be adding a new campus in Austin, creating 3,600 new jobs. The Fund would be investing $21 million over ten years.\n\n\n"}

A major focus is on exploring the dynamic gains associated with lowering trade transactions costs and identifying the relative importance (net benefits) of related reform measures. The project has two primary parts: research and policy relevant analysis, and support for new data.\n\nThe project analyzes trade facilitation effects in a broad sense, as its analysis spans the entire realm of a typical international trade transaction; this includes, among other topics, the transparency and professionalism of customs and regulatory environments, the efficiency of supply chain-related infrastructure, the harmonization of product standards, and conformance to international or regional regulations.\n\nThe Project is led by Lead Economist John S. Wilson of the World Bank, and is funded through a Trust Fund at the World Bank established by the United Kingdom Department for International Development and a Multi-donor Trust Fund for Trade and Development.\n\nResearch associated with the project has included policy working papers, presentations, learning events, and research briefs. \n\n\n\n\n"}
