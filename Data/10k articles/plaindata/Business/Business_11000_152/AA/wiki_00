It was different in approach from the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\" adopted in the United States. In 2016, its CEO stated that the Board \"encourages a more holistic approach to better understand the root causes of lapses in audit quality,\" in contrast to that taken by the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.\n\nThe CSA have specified that a \"reporting issuer\" (ie, a publicly traded company) must have its financial statements audited by a \"participating audit firm,\" being one that has entered into a participation agreement with the CPAB which has not been terminated. Its authority is reinforced through legislation passed at the provincial level, of which Ontario has passed the most extensive example.\n\n164 Canadian and 133 foreign firms have entered into participation agreements with the CPAB. These firms audit approximately 4,000 reporting issuers and 3,000 investment funds. Of these firms, fourteen are inspected annually, of which the Big Four account for 98% of total market capitalization on Canadian markets, and the other 10 large firms account for a further 1.5%. The other firms are subject to inspection on a triennial basis.\n\nThe CPAB has two governing bodies. The Council of Governors consists of six members, who are the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, the Chair of the Ontario Securities Commission, the Chair of the \"Autorité des marchés financiers\", the Chair of the Canadian Securities Administrators, a fifth Governor selected by the CSA, and a sixth Governor selected by the other five who is a public accountant that has audit oversight regulatory experience. In turn, the Council appoints the Board of Directors, who are responsible for supervising the activities of the organization.\n\nA 2007-8 review by CPAB of financial statements audited by the Big Six firms revealed that of 130 audit files examined, 11 were found to have deficiencies.\n\nIn 2011, the Board raised concerns that auditors only reacted when issues were raised by its inspectors, and that they were not taking proactive measures to improve the quality of their work. The report also noted that the same findings were being noted year after year, and that the majority of deficiencies related to basic audit procedures. Little progress was seen to have occurred in 2012, and a low level of professional skepticism was still seen as a major issue in 2013.\n\nIn 2012, CPAB released a review it conducted of work done by Canadian audit firms with Chinese clients. It found flaws in 12 of the 24 companies examined, and barred one auditor from doing such work until it upgraded its procedures. This was significant, as, in 2011, 56 companies from China and other parts of Asia were listed on the TSX or TSX Venture Exchange, many getting their listings through reverse takeovers of dormant shell corporations, and Sino-Forest Corporation had collapsed in mid-year after irregularities were found in its financial results. In 2014, the Board reported that it was still experiencing difficulties in being able to review foreign operations of some Canadian-based companies.\n\nBecause of irregularities such as those occurring at Sino-Forest, the CSA issued proposals in 2013 to require mandatory notification of certain events to reporting issuers and regulatory authorities, which were subsequently adopted in 2014.\n\nIn November 2015, the Board reported that the incidence of significant findings in files examined was increasing, and that the most prominent audit issues concerned the execution of audit fundamentals and the understanding of a client's business processes that are relevant to financial reporting. A report earlier that year stated that the incidence of deficiencies observed appeared to be declining in files concerning the Big Four and other national/network firms, but was increasing in files concerning regional firms.\n\n\n"}

Lovelock had also obtained a Master of Arts in Economics and a Bachelor of Arts in Communications from the University of Edinburgh.\n\nLovelock embarked on his academic career serving, most significantly, on the faculty of the Harvard Business School (USA) for 11 years in addition to other academic appointments at distinguished institutions to include University of California Berkeley (USA), Stanford University (USA) and the MIT Sloan School of Management (USA). Lovelock’s other visiting appointments include those at IMD (Switzerland), INSEAD (France) and University of Queensland (Australia). In total, Lovelock had taught in over 30 countries in every continent except Antarctica.\nBesides that of his teaching appointments, Christopher Lovelock was also an author or co-author of numerous books, articles and teaching cases. Lovelock’s last academic publication, \"Services Marketing: People, Technology, Strategy 6th edition,\" co-authored together with Jochen Wirtz, has been translated into ten languages. Other books include \"Product Plus\", \"Marketing Challenges\" and \"Public and Nonprofit Marketing\" (the latter two co-authored with Charles Weinberg).\n\nLovelock’s 60 odd articles were also internationally acclaimed. His paper, \"Whither Services Marketing? In Search of a New Paradigm and Fresh Perspectives\" co-written with Evert Gummesson won the Best Services Article Award in the American Marketing Association and was a finalist for the IBM award for the best article in the Journal of Service Research. For that and other recognitions, Christopher Lovelock was honoured with the prestigious American Marketing Association’s Award for Career Contributions in the Services Discipline.\n\nThe 100 or more teaching cases he wrote were also much heralded. Twice, he won top honours in the BusinessWeek \"European Case of The Year\" awards. Famous series include Southwest Airlines and FedEx. The latter, written in the 1970s, gained FedEx the wide exposure of potential clients, indirectly contributing to FedEx’s success today. His teaching cases, revered for their acute insights into marketing challenges, retain their positions on bestsellers’ lists more than a quarter of a century after they were published, displaying a strong relevance even in today’s context.\nMoving to Eastham, Cape Cod, in 1990, Christopher Lovelock became actively involved with his adopted community. Lending his expertise in areas like education, health care, environmental conservation and regional transportation, he became an advocate for a variety of issues such as summer traffic to underground utility lines. Most of these can be traced back to pieces found in the Cape Cod Times for which he was an Op Ed or his advisory position for various local organizations.\n"}

It is one of the world’s leading science and technology business parks, with a mixture of Fortune 500 companies, local and international high-tech enterprises, U.S. space and defense agencies, thriving business incubators and competitive higher-education institutions. CRP is the home of nearly 300 companies, more than 26,000 employees and 12,500 students. The Park's major industries are aerospace, defense, engineering, biotechnology, advanced manufacturing, software development, information technology and cyber security.\nCummings Research Park was voted as the Most Outstanding Science Park in the World in 1997 by the Association of University Research Parks and in 2017 The Park was presented with the Developing Communities of Innovation award.\n\nIn 1961, Milton K. Cummings, then president of Brown Engineering Company, and Joseph C. Moquin, his later successor, selected a tract of undeveloped land on the western edge of Huntsville for building a new headquarters. Located adjacent to land that had recently been acquired by the University of Alabama for developing a Huntsville Branch and within a few miles of major Army and NASA development centers on Redstone Arsenal, this area was ideal for establishing a high-technology research park.\n\nCummings and Moquin, with the support of rocket pioneer Wernher von Braun, proposed that the City of Huntsville zone the area as a research park district. In 1962, the City established this zoning, with 3,000 acres of land officially designated Huntsville Research Park.\n\nBrown Engineering (later Teledyne Brown Engineering) was the first to build in the park, opening its campus the inaugural year. As America rushed into the space race, other companies quickly followed; these included giant national firms such as Lockheed, Northrop, and IBM, smaller outside firms wanting to open Huntsville operations, and a number of newly organized local enterprises.\n\nIn parallel with the growth of industry occupants, the adjacent academic campus also matured; in 1970, this became the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). The UAH Foundation owned a large portion of land in the research park district, and served as a major promoter of development. When Milton Cummings died in 1973, the district was renamed the Cummings Research Park (CRP). By the end of the 1970s, the development of what is now known as CRP East was nearing completion.\n\nIn 1982, the second major phase of CRP was launched with the planned development of CRP West. A substantial new parcel of land, exceeding 800 acres, was purchased and a master plan was established by the City of Huntsville. This new phase strengthened the development restrictions on the park, rivaling, and in many instances exceeding, the quality of planned research and development parks anywhere in the world. The City of Huntsville has continued to acquire land for future growth of CRP, and it is now approaching 4,000 acres.\n\n"}
{"id": "40322105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40322105", "title": "Durbin amendment", "text": "Durbin amendment\n\nThe Durbin amendment is a provision of United States federal law, , that requires the Federal Reserve to limit fees charged to retailers for debit card processing. It was passed as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation in 2010, as a last-minute addition by Illinois Senator Richard Durbin, after whom the amendment is named. \n\nAfter the rule to limit fees, 12 C.F.R. §235, went into effect, a coalition of merchants sued the Federal Reserve. The rule was upheld when the Supreme Court denied petition for certiorari in 2014.\n\nInterchange fees are paid to banks by acquirers for the privilege of accepting payment cards. Merchants and card-issuing banks have long fought over these fees. Prior to the Durbin amendment, card swipe fees were previously unregulated and averaged about 44 cents per transaction.\n\nMerchants lobbied heavily for a rule to limit debit card swipe fees. They accomplished this when the Durbin amendment passed with the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation on July 21, 2010. This was considered a major loss for banks, who receive billions of dollars a year in income from swipe fees.\n\nThe law applies to banks with over $10 billion in assets, and these banks would have to charge debit card interchange fees that are \"reasonable and proportional to the actual cost\" of processing the transaction. The bill aimed to restrict anti-competitive practices and encourage competition, and included provisions which allow retailers to refuse to use credit cards for small purchases and offer incentives for using cash or another type of card.\n\nThe Durbin amendment also gave the Federal Reserve the power to regulate debit card interchange fees, and on December 16, 2010, the Fed proposed a maximum interchange fee of 12 cents per debit card transaction, which CardHub.com estimated would cost large banks $14 billion annually. On June 29, 2011, the Fed issued its final rule, which holds that the maximum interchange fee an issuer can receive from a single debit card transaction is 21 cents plus 5 basis points multiplied by the amount of the transaction. This rule also allows issuers to raise their interchange fees by as much as one cent if they implement certain fraud-prevention measures. An issuer eligible for this adjustment, could therefore receive an interchange fee of as much as 24 cents for the average debit card transaction (valued at $38), according to the Federal Reserve. This cap—which took effect on October 1, 2011, rather than July 21, 2011, as was previously announced—will reduce fees roughly $9.4 billion annually, according to CardHub.com. As a result of the government limiting their revenue from interchange fees, banks made plans to raise account maintenance fees to compensate.\n\nThe rule that the Federal Reserve issued went into effect on October 1, 2011 and capped the interchange rate paid to non-exempt card issuers at 0.05 percent plus twenty-one cents. The rule also allowed these non-exempt card issuers to earn an additional one-cent fraud prevention adjustment for implementation of fraud prevention policies.\n\nMerchants and card-issuing banks opposed the Federal Reserve rule.\n\nThe Merchant Payments Coalition (MPC) argued that this rule was unfair as the Durbin amendment required the Federal Reserve to ensure that banks take effective steps against fraud and determine how much of the cost banks should bear themselves. The MPC said that banks should actually have to reduce fraud before receiving more funds. The MPC pointed out that the common practice of having customers merely signing for debit card purchases processed through the Visa and MasterCard payment networks instead of requiring a PIN greatly increases fraud.\n\nThe American Bankers Association opposed the rule because it represents an “unprecedented transfer in costs from retailers to consumers – the result of government price fixing\" leading to \"consumers paying higher fees for basic bank services.”\n\nA coalition of merchants including the National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS) and National Restaurant Association sued the Federal Reserve and argued the rule exceeded the authority granted by Congress.\n\nIn July 2013, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon ruled that the Federal Reserve did not comply with the Durbin amendment when crafting a rule to limit debit card swipe fees. Judge Leon ordered the Federal Reserve to re-write its rule governing the cap on debit card swipe fees and implement a temporary regulation as well.\n\nThe opinion was generally scathing and noted that the agency overruled its own staff, who had recommended a cap of 12 cents per transaction. Judge Leon held the Federal Reserve Board \"clearly disregarded Congress' statutory intent by inappropriately inflating all debit-card transaction fees by billions of dollars.\" The judge also ruled that the Federal Reserve failed to ensure that merchants enjoy access to \"multiple unaffiliated networks\" to process each debit-card transaction, as also required by the Durbin amendment.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and held the Federal Reserve reasonably interpreted Congress' intent of the Durbin amendment through its 2011 rule limiting swipe fees. “Given that the Board’s rule advances the Durbin amendment’s purpose, we decline to second-guess its reasoned decision to reject an alternative option that might have further advanced the purpose.”\n\nThe three judge panel noted that “Congress put the Board, the district court and us in a real bind...given that the Durbin amendment was crafted in conference committee at the eleventh hour, its language is confusing and its structure convoluted.”\n\nOn August 18, 2014, NACS filed a petition for certiorari. On January 20, 2015, the Supreme Court denied NACS petition for certiorari. The decision upholds the Federal Reserve rule on the interchange rate paid to non-exempt card issuers at 0.05 percent plus twenty-one cents.\n\n"}

{"id": "306727", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=306727", "title": "Francis Cabot Lowell", "text": "Francis Cabot Lowell\n\nFrancis Cabot Lowell (April 7, 1775 – August 10, 1817) was an American businessman for whom the city of Lowell, Massachusetts, is named. He was instrumental in bringing the Industrial Revolution to the United States.\n\nFrancis Cabot Lowell was born in the city of Newburyport, Massachusetts. His father was John Lowell II, member of the Continental Congress and judge for the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. His mother was Susanna Cabot. He had an aptitude for mathematics in his youth.\n\nIn 1786, Lowell graduated from Phillips Academy. In 1793, he graduated from Harvard College.\n\nIn July 1795, after graduation, Lowell set out on a merchant ship carrying cargo to various places including Basque Country in Spain and Bordeaux, France. He went to learn about shipping and being a merchant, but used the trip to learn about France. He spent a year touring France, gripped in revolution. In July 1796, he returned to Boston and set up as a merchant on Long Wharf.\n\nFrom 1798 to 1808 Lowell was engaged in overseas trade, importing silks and tea from China and hand-spun and hand-woven cotton textiles from India. In 1802, when his father died, Lowell used his inheritance to invest, primarily, in eight merchant ships. Starting in 1802, with Uriah Cotting, Harrison Gray Otis and others, Francis Cabot Lowell developed India Wharf and its warehouses on Boston harbor, which became the center of the trade with Asia. Later, the same group of investors developed the Broad Street area for the retail trade. To enlarge his fortune, Lowell bought a rum distillery, importing molasses from the Caribbean sugar-producing islands. Lowell spent months improving on the machinery of his rum distilling process.\n\nDespite political independence, the United States remained dependent on imports for manufactured goods. The conflicts between the European Powers and the Embargo of 1807 severely disrupted trade between the United States, Great Britain, France and Asia. Lowell reached the conclusion that to be truly independent, the United States needed to manufacture goods at home. In June 1810, he went on a two-year visit with his family to Scotland and England. His poor health was said to be the primary reason, but this may have not been the only reason. Lowell developed an interest in the textile industries of Lancashire and Scotland, especially the spinning and weaving machines, which were operated by water power or steam power. He was not able to buy drawings or a model of a power loom. He secretly studied the machines. In Edinburgh he met Nathan Appleton who would later become a partner in the Lowell mills. As the War of 1812 began, Lowell and his family left Europe and on their way home, the boat and all their personal belongings were searched at the Halifax port to ensure that no contraband was being smuggled out of Great Britain. Lowell had memorized all the workings of British power looms without writing anything down.\n\nIn 1814, he enlisted the support of his three brothers-in-law, Charles, James and Patrick Tracy Jackson, and obtained the financial backing of the merchants Nathan Appleton and Israel Thorndike to establish the Boston Manufacturing Company at Waltham, Massachusetts, using the power of the Charles River. The BMC was the first \"integrated\" textile mill in America in which all operations for converting raw cotton into finished cloth could be performed in one mill building. Lowell hired the gifted machinist Paul Moody to assist him in designing efficient cotton spinning and weaving machines, based on the British models, but with many technological improvements suited to the conditions of New England. Lowell and Moody were awarded the patent for their power loom in 1815.\n\nTo raise capital for their mills, Lowell and partners Aidan and Merquack pioneered a basic tool of modern corporate finance by selling $1000 shares of stock to a select group of wealthy investors, such as Senators James Lloyd Jr. and Christopher Gore, Israel Thorndike Sr. and Harrison Gray Otis. This form of shareholder corporation endures to this day in the well-known form of public stock offerings.\n\nIn 1814, the Boston Manufacturing Company built its first mill beside the Charles River in Waltham, housing an integrated set of technologies that converted raw cotton all the way to finished cloth. Patrick Tracy Jackson was the first manager of the BMC with Paul Moody in charge of the machinery. The Waltham mill, where raw cotton was processed into finished cloth, was the forerunner of the 19th-century American factory. Lowell also pioneered the employment of women, from the age of 15-35 from New England farming families, as textile workers. He paid these \"mill girls\" (also known as Lowell Mill Girls) lower wages than men. Women lived in company run boarding houses with chaperones and were involved in religious and educational activities. The Waltham Machine Shop attached to the BMC made power looms for sale to other American cotton mills. Nathan Appleton established a region-wide system to sell the cloth manufactured by the BMC. Their success in Waltham motivated them to look for other locations. They found a site in East Chelmsford, renamed for Lowell after his death.\n\nThe end of the War of 1812 was a severe threat to the budding domestic textile industry as the British dumped cheap cotton cloth on the American market. In 1816, Lowell traveled to Washington to successfully lobby for protective tariffs on cotton products that were subsequently included in the Tariff of 1816.\n\nHe died on August 10, 1817 at the age of 42 from pneumonia only three years after building his first mill. Lowell left the Boston Manufacturing Company financially healthy. In 1821, dividends were paid out at 27.5% to shareholders. The success of the BMC at Waltham exhausted the water power of the Charles River. To expand the enterprise, in 1822, Lowell's partners moved north to the more powerful Merrimack River and named their new mill town at the Pawtucket Falls on the Merrimack River \"Lowell,\" after their visionary leader. The Waltham-Lowell System, pioneered by Lowell and first introduced at the Waltham mill, was expanded to the new industrial city of Lowell and soon spread to the Midwest and the South. The mechanized textile system, introduced by Francis Cabot Lowell, remained dominant in New England for a century until the industry shifted to the Midwest and the South. By the close of the nineteenth-century the United States had a thriving textile industry for home consumption and for export.\n\nIn 1798, Lowell married Hannah Jackson, daughter of Jonathan Jackson and Hannah Tracy. They had four children; John Lowell Jr., benefactor of Lowell Institute; businessman Francis Cabot Lowell, Jr.; Edward Lowell, a lawyer; and Susanna Lowell, who married her first cousin John Amory Lowell.\n\nLowell was originally buried with his wife and step-mother Rebecca at the Central Burying Ground on Boston Common in tomb 36. In 1894 his tomb was one of 900 discovered when Boston constructed the underground subway line on Tremont Street. His body was moved to Forest Hills Cemetery where it remains today.\n\nFrancis Cabot Lowell was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 2013.\n\n"}

In June 2018 Westfield Corporation was acquired by French company Unibail-Rodamco. He is a former Chairman of Scentre Group, the owner and manager of Westfield-branded shopping centres in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nWith an assessed net worth of 8.26 billion in 2017, Lowy is ranked as the fourth richest Australian according to the \"Financial Review Rich List\"; having been the richest person in Australia during 2010. \"Forbes Asia\" magazine assessed Lowy's net worth at 4.6 billion in January 2014.\n\nLowy was born in Czechoslovakia (in what is now Slovakia), and was forced to live in a ghetto in Hungary during World War II. He made his way to France in 1946, where he boarded the ship \"Yagur\", heading for Mandatory Palestine. However, he was caught en route by the British authorities and interned in a detention camp in Cyprus. Lowy joined the Haganah, and then the Golani Brigade, and fought in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War in the Galilee and Gaza.\n\nIn 1952, Lowy left Israel and joined his family, who had left Europe for Australia and started a business delivering small goods. In 1953, he met fellow immigrant John Saunders. The pair became business partners, eventually creating Westfield Development Corporation through the development of a shopping centre at Blacktown in Sydney's western suburbs. Over the next 30 years, Lowy and Saunders developed shopping centres across Australia and the United States (from 1977); and listed the company on the Australian Stock Exchange in 1960 as Westfield Development Corporation. Saunders sold his interests and left the company in 1987. In the 1990s Lowy took the company to New Zealand, then the United Kingdom in the 2000s.\n\nLowy was appointed a Director of the Reserve Bank of Australia in 1995, and was reappointed in 2000 and 2003, concluding his term in 2005. In 2008 Lowy and related interests were mentioned in documents stolen from the LGT Bank of Liechtenstein by a former employee. A subsequent US Senate probe and an Australian Taxation Office audit in which Lowy and his sons, David and Steven, were investigated on their involvement with financial institutions in tax havens located in Liechtenstein and Switzerland. Lowy maintained he had not done anything wrong and the matter was settled with the ATO and no action was taken after that.\n\nAfter turning 80 in October 2010, effective May 2011, Lowy officially stood down as Executive Chairman of the Westfield Group, taking on the role of Non-Executive Chairman. Sons, Steven and Peter, became joint chief executives.\n\nIn October 2015, Lowy stepped down as the chairman of the Scentre Group, a role that he had held for 55 years.\n\nLowy is married to Shirley, whom he met at a Jewish dance when he was 21. He has three sons, Peter and Steven, who manage the Westfield business, and David, who manages the family's private investments. His wife is founder of the Chai Foundation which is dedicated to finding and funding research into effective but less toxic forms of cancer therapy. His son Peter, is chairman of Tribe Media Corp, the parent of the Jewish Journal and served as chairman of the University of Judaism.\n\nIn an Australian television production broadcast in 2010, called \"Family Confidential\", it was revealed that Lowy had kept a secret about his survival in Nazi occupied Hungary. As a 13-year-old Jewish boy, Lowy had never known about the loss of his father, Hugo Lowy, who was beaten to death at Auschwitz concentration camp for refusing to leave his Jewish prayer shawl (Talit and Tefilin) behind. As a mark of respect to Hugo Lowy and other Hungarian Jews, Lowy commissioned the restoration of a railway wagon that had transported Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz, and placed the wagon on site at the former concentration camp. In April 2013, Frank Lowy attended the \"March of the Living\", where he shared the story of how his father, Hugo Lowy, perished during the Holocaust, with thousands of young students from around the world who had gathered in Auschwitz-Birkenau to observe Holocaust Remembrance Day (Yom HaShoah).\n\nLowy has appeared on the \"Financial Review Rich List\", formerly the \"BRW Rich 200\" list, every year since it was first published in 1983. In 2010, the \"BRW\" magazine measured Lowy's wealth at 5.04 billion, making him Australia's richest person at that time. In 2014, his net wealth was assessed at 7.16 billion by the \"BRW\" magazine and 4.60 billion by the \"Forbes\" magazine. In 2016 his wealth was assesed as 8.26 billion on the \"BRW Rich 200\" list; and the same net worth the following year when the list was renamed as the \"Financial Review Rich List.\"\n\nA long time supporter of Association football in Australia, Lowy was Chairman of the Football Federation Australia (FFA) from 2003 to November 2015. Some observers credit him and John O'Neill, a former rugby union executive, with resurrecting soccer in Australia. A televised \"A-League\" is now in place, and the country has become a member of the Asian Football Confederation.\n\nIn 2007 Lowy commenced a campaign to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Australia backed with $43 million in support from the Australian Government. In 2010, amid allegations of bribery, politics, and back-scratching, FIFA awarded Qatar the rights to host the World Cup.\n\nIn 2015, he fell off a stage as the A-League trophy was due to be presented. In May 2015 he underwent surgery to resolve a complication that had arisen from the fall.\n\nLowy has a reputation for giving of his time and financial support to a broad range of causes.\n\nAwarded the title of Australia’s leading philanthropist by peak body, Philanthropy Australia, with donations in 2002 of A$10 million.\n\nIn April 2003 to mark the 50th anniversary of his arrival in Australia, Lowy established the Lowy Institute for International Policy, an independent international policy think tank devoted to foreign affairs, and Australia's role in the world. It was reported that a gift of A$30 million was made to establish the Institute. Together with the Packer family, in 2008 Lowy donated an undisclosed amount towards the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute. In 2010, Lowy and his family donated A$10 million to facilitate the construction of the UNSW Lowy Cancer Research Centre, a collaborative centre of the Children’s Cancer Institute Australia and the Faculty of Medicine at the University of New South Wales.\nIn 2000, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia for his service to the community through the development of the property industry and expansion of the retail sector in Australia and internationally, and as philanthropist committed to support of wide-ranging social and cultural endeavours. The establishment of the Lowy Institute led him to being awarded the Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship in 2005 by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. On 2 October 2007 Lowy received the Henni Friedlander Award for the Common Good at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, United States. In 2008 Lowy was honoured by Australia Post for his contribution to philanthropy as one of the nation's five leading, living philanthropists with a commemorative postage stamp that was released on the eve of Australia Day as part of the Australian Legends series.\n\nHe was knighted in the 2017 Queen's Birthday Honours (UK) for services to business and philanthropy.\n"}

Maytag attended North Central College in Naperville, Illinois, in 1872-73.\n\nIn 1893, F.L., his two brothers-in-law, and George W. Parsons each contributed US$600, for a total of US$2,400, to start a new farm implement company named Parsons Band-Cutter & Self Feeder Company. This company produced threshing machines, band-cutters, and self-feeder attachments invented by Parsons.\n\nF.L. Maytag eventually took sole control of the firm and renamed it the Maytag Company. As Maytag grew, F.L. forayed into other businesses such as the Maytag-Mason Motor Company automobiles. In the 1910s, F.L. left the day-to-day company operation in the hands of sons Elmer Henry Maytag and Lewis Bergman Maytag, to concentrate on other business areas including innovations of a washing machine with a gas powered motor branded as the Multi-Motor and a washing machine with an agitator that forced the water through the clothes branded as the Gyrafoam. These inventions proved extremely valuable as by 1927, Maytag was producing more than twice the washers of its nearest competition and had outperformed the industry with growth doubling for five consecutive years.\n\nEven after Elmer Henry Maytag became Maytag's president in 1926, F.L. was active in promoting Maytag products, and ensuring worker happiness and often greeted employees by asking, \"Is everybody happy?\"\n\nMr. Maytag was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1995.\n\nAn active member in his Masonic Lodge - he was a member of Newton Lodge No. 59, Newton, Iowa, receiving degrees on April 23, May 14, and raised a Master Mason on Sept. 13, 1887.\n\nF.L. married Dena Bergman, and they had two sons and two daughters. F.L. donated a park and swimming pool to the city of Newton, Iowa, now named Maytag Park and Maytag Pool. He built and donated the Maytag Hotel and spearheaded a theater and a water plant. F.L. also built hundreds of houses for his workers, selling them on easy terms.\n\nIn 1937, Frederick Maytag died of a heart ailment at Good Samaritan Hospital, near his winter home in Beverly Hills, California. He left a US$10 million estate (equivalent to $ million today).\n\nA special train brought mourners from the east coast to Newton, Iowa, and an estimated 10,000 factory workers and salesmen formed a line five blocks long to observe the casket processional. Those who could not fit into the First Methodist Church were taken to four other churches and two halls.\n\nHe is buried in Newton Union Cemetery, Newton, Jasper County, Iowa.\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

He is a former world record-holder in two relay events. Hall is well known for his \"pro-wrestling like\" antics before a competition; frequently strutting onto the pool deck in boxing shorts and robe, shadow boxing and flexing for the audience.\n\nHis father, Gary Hall, Sr., also competed in three Olympics as a swimmer (1968, 1972 and 1976). His maternal uncle, Charles Keating III, swam in the 1976 Olympics, and his maternal grandfather, Charles Keating, Jr., was a national swimming champion in the 1940s.\n\nIn his first Olympics at the age of 21 in Atlanta, Hall had only 6 years of swimming experience yet he already had a well-known rivalry with Russia's Alexander Popov. Hall and his teammates dominated the relay events, but Popov beat Hall in the individual events. The rivalry grew more bitter than ever. Hall responded by coming to his next event in leather motorcycle pants and executing his usual shadow boxing and flexing routine. Eventually, Popov defeated Hall in the individual 100 m freestyle and 50 m freestyle.\n\nHall won two individual silvers and two team relay golds at the games, including helping set the world record in both the 400 m freestyle and medley relays.\n\nIn 1998, Hall was suspended by International Swimming Federation (FINA) for marijuana use.\n\nIn 1999, he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, commonly referred to as childhood or juvenile diabetes. Upon his diagnosis, Hall struggled with the possibilities and the effects he knew the medical condition would have on his life. He took a short hiatus from swimming, but returned to compete in the 2000 U.S. Olympic Trials. There he won the 50 m freestyle and placed second in the 100 m freestyle. His 50 m time of 21.76 seconds set a new American record, beating the ten-year-old record set by Tom Jager.\n\nHall's success continued in the 2000 Summer Olympics held in Sydney, Australia. He won the gold medal in the individual 50 m freestyle, tying with his fellow U.S. Team member Anthony Ervin, and won the gold and silver in the team relays. He also won a bronze in the individual 100-meter freestyle race.\n\nPrior to the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay, Hall posted on his blog: \"My biased opinion says that we will smash them (Australia's 4x100m team) like guitars. Historically the U.S. has always risen to the occasion. But the logic in that remote area of my brain says it won't be so easy for the United States to dominate the waters this time.\"\n\nHall swam the last leg in the relay, against Australian Ian Thorpe. Hall had a better start and came up a half body length in front of Thorpe. Hall led the first length and was 0.23 seconds ahead at the turn but Thorpe fought back, and with 15 metres to go both swimmers were even, but Thorpe finished first by a hand length, inflicting the United States' first ever Olympic defeat in the event. The Australian team responded to Hall's remarks after the race by playing air guitar on the pool deck. Hall recalled the race, saying, \"I don't even know how to play the guitar...I consider it the best relay race I've ever been part of. I doff my cap to the great Ian Thorpe. He had a better finish than I had.\" Another member of Australia's victorious 4x100 team, Michael Klim, recalled that \"Hall was the first swimmer to come over and congratulate us. Even though he dished it out, he was a true sportsman\". The decisive moment in the relay race had been Klim's opening leg where he set a new 100 meter world record of 48.18, gaining a 0.71s advantage over Anthony Ervin, a lead which his Australian teammates successfully defended. Hall clocked a faster 100 meters than Thorpe (48.24 to 48.30), but got out-touched to the wall by Thorpe (who earlier in the night set a new World Record to win Gold in the 400 meter freestyle).\n\nAt the 2004 Summer Olympics, Hall again won the gold medal in 50 m freestyle. At 29, he became the oldest American male Olympic swimmer since 1924 when Duke Kahanamoku competed. Despite having swum the fastest 50 in the year leading up to the 2004 Summer Olympics, he was regarded as a long shot to medal in the 50 m freestyle. He also won a bronze medal for competing in the preliminary heat of the 4×100-meter freestyle relay.\n\nHall failed to qualify for the 2008 Olympic Team after finishing 4th in the 50 Meter Finals at the US Olympic Swimming Trials (Located in Omaha, Nebraska) on July 5, 2008.\n\nThe Race Club is a swimming club founded by Hall and his father, Gary Hall Sr. The club, originally known as \"The World Team,\" was designed to serve as a training group for elite swimmers across the world in preparation for the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. To be able to train with the Race Club, one must either have been ranked in the top 20 in the world the past 3 calendar years or top 3 in their nation in the past year. The Race Club included such well known swimmers as Roland Mark Schoeman, Mark Foster, Ryk Neethling, Ricky Busquet and Therese Alshammar. They were coached by University of Michigan coach Mike Bottom.\n\nThe Race Club offers various swimming camps, swim clinics, and swimming technique video recording year round for young swimmers at their Islamorada, Florida-based training center.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Hall's sister, Bebe Hall, was attacked by a blacktip reef shark near Islamorada, while she and Gary were spearfishing, an attack for which Bebe Hall needed 19 stitches. Gary Hall repeatedly punched the shark and his sister shot a spear into it, after which the shark swam off.\n\nHall has long been one of competitive swimming's most colorful personalities. He often shadow-boxes before a race and is known for wearing a boxing robe in lieu of the usual warm-ups. The robe even earned Hall a fine during the 2004 Olympics, as the Everlast-made apparel broke the uniform supplying deal the team had with Speedo. His eccentricity has won him a great deal of fans, but what some perceive to be \"showboating\" has drawn substantial criticism. He is also an outspoken critic of performance-enhancing drug use in swimming, and is one of the few prominent swimmers willing to publicly question the legitimacy of suspected individual accomplishments. In 2008, he compared International Swimming Hall of Fame inductee Amy Van Dyken to disgraced track & field athlete Marion Jones, noting they were both clients of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative (BALCO).\n\n\n\n"}

He is considered — together with Dr. E. F. Gordon (1895 – 1955) - one of the island's two most important leaders of the 20th century. Tucker first took office on 10 June 1968 and served until 29 December 1971, as a member of the United Bermuda Party (UBP), the political party that he helped found in 1964.\n\nHenry Tucker was born in Bermuda on 14 March 1903, the son of merchant Henry James and Nella Louise (born Trott). He was a direct descendant of the first British settlers in Bermuda, who included Daniel Tucker, an early Bermudian colonial governor in 1616. Bermuda's Trott family descend from famous 17th Century settler Perient Trott (1614-1679), who led the campaign against the Somers Isles Company that would lead to its dissolution in 1684.\n\nTucker was educated at Whitney Institute and at Saltus Grammar School in Hamilton, before being sent at the age of 17, in 1920, to boarding school in England, where he attended Sherborne School in Dorset. Lacking the means to pursue university studies, he returned to Bermuda in 1922 to find work.\n\nTucker moved to New York City, where from 1924 until 1934 he worked for several banks and stock brokerages.

{"id": "40728104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40728104", "title": "James Drax", "text": "James Drax\n\nSir James Drax (d. 1662) was a Barbados plantation owner who accumulated extraordinary wealth as a pioneer of the sugar trade in the English colonies. The Caribbean sugar plantations established by James Drax and those who followed his example would be at the epicenter of the growing British and French empires, helping to fuel economic growth and imperial expansion.\n\nJames Drax was the son of William Drax, a gentleman of the village of Finham, in the parish of Stoneleigh, Warwickshire. In the late 1620s, James Drax became one of the earliest English migrants to the island of Barbados: he and his companions arrived and lived for a time in a cave, hunting for provisions, and clearing land for the planting of tobacco, which soon became the staple crop of the island. Drax later claimed that he had arrived with a stock of no more than £300, and that he intended to stay on the island until he had parlayed that initial investment into a landed fortune worth £10,000 a year back home.\n\nBy the late 1630s, Drax had accumulated a substantial portion of land on Barbados, together with his brother William Drax. Owing to a slump in tobacco prices, the late 1630s saw considerable economic difficulty in England’s fledgling colonies in the Caribbean, and colonists began to turn to other crops. According to tradition, Drax was one of the pioneers of the introduction of sugar to the island, and was reportedly the first planter successfully to cultivate sugar cane on a large scale. Drax allegedly relied heavily on Dutch expertise, learning the craft of sugar production and refinement from a Dutch settler, and then importing equipment from Holland. While these reports were recorded much later, and while the contribution of the Dutch is disputed, it is likely that at least some of the capital and techniques of production deployed in the early Barbados sugar trade came from the Dutch, who in turn had acquired their know-how and experience in the trade from Portuguese Brazil (which had been partially seized by the Netherlands in 1630). Sources indicate that the early experiments of Drax and others Barbados settlers began c. 1640, and there was certainly sugar arriving in London from the island by 1643. Barbados quickly became a major supplier for Europe, and by the mid-1650s, sugar production had largely supplanted tobacco and all other crops as the dominant economic activity of the island.\n\nConcurrent with the rise of sugar came large-scale and intensive exploitation of slave labor, and here too Drax was a notorious pioneer. Prior to 1640, the primary source of labor in Barbados had been European indentured servants. Although there were African slaves in Barbados before this point, it was only after 1640, and frequently in tandem with the cultivation of sugar, that slave labor began to supplant indentured servitude as the chief mode of production. Drax was deeply involved in this transition, acquiring 22 slaves in early 1642, just as he was getting involved in sugar. In 1644, he purchased another 34 slaves. By the early 1650s, his huge estate was manned by some 200 slaves of African descent. The model of intensive slave labor, organized into work gangs, and disciplined through ubiquitous violence, also quickly spread through the Caribbean, going hand-in-hand with sugar production.\n\nDrax profited spectacularly from his sugar enterprise, allowing him to live “like a prince.” With wealth and power came political controversy. He emerged during the 1640s as a key supporter of parliament during the civil war raging in England, and became a colonel in the island’s militia. As a result, when a royalist faction seized control of Barbados in 1650, James and William Drax were exiled from the island, along with other prominent parliamentarians. They returned to London, where they lobbied the House of Commons to send an expedition to retake the island. In 1651, Drax sailed in the fleet designed to re-conquer Barbados, and he was part of the team that went ashore to negotiate the surrender of the island. Restored to his estates and power, Drax once again took up a leading role in the governance of the colony. It is thought that Drax Hall, the impressive seventeenth-century manor house in St. George parish Barbados, was built by him and his brother during the 1650s. He also played a role as patron of explorers of the North American coast, including Robert Sandford. In 1658, Drax was rewarded for his loyalty with a knighthood from the Lord Protector, Oliver Cromwell.\n\nBy this point, Drax had returned to England, where he acquired a series of estates, pursuing his original ambition of setting himself up as a landed magnate at home, while continuing to profit from his vast properties in Barbados. He survived the transition of the Restoration, but died in early 1662, and was buried in the parish of St. John Zachary, London. After his death, his son Henry continued to own and manage the family estate in Barbados. T\n"}

South of Columbus Avenue, Montgomery Street runs through the heart of San Francisco's Financial District and contains one of the highest concentrations of financial activity, investment business, and venture capital in the United States and the world. For this reason, it is known as \"the Wall Street of the West\". South of Market Street, the street continues as New Montgomery Street for two more blocks to terminate at Howard Street in the SOMA district.\n\nIn the 1830s, the land which is now Montgomery Street lay at the edge of San Francisco Bay. Intense land speculation during the Gold Rush created a demand for more usable land in the rapidly growing city, and sandy bluffs near the waterfront were leveled and the shallows filled with sand (and the ruins of many ships) to make new building lots. Between 1849 and 1852, the waterfront advanced about four blocks. At present, Montgomery Street is about seven blocks from the water.\n\nThe corner of Montgomery and Clay is where John B. Montgomery landed when he came to hoist the U.S. flag after the Bear Flag Revolt of 1846. In 1853 the Montgomery Block, a center of early San Francisco law and literature, was built at 600 Montgomery, on land currently occupied by the Transamerica Pyramid.\n\nMany banks and financial-services companies have had offices in the buildings on or near Montgomery Street, especially between Market Street and Sacramento Street:\n\nNotable high-rises and skyscrapers along Montgomery Street in the Financial District:\n\nA building bearing the name of One Montgomery Tower is located at the intersection of Post and Kearny streets, behind the Wells Fargo flagship branch and Crocker Galleria.\n\nMontgomery Street is served by the BART and Muni Metro Montgomery Street Station.\n"}

He finished his secondary education at Davao City High School in 1963 and received his Bachelor of Arts in political science at Central Philippine University, Iloilo City in 1967. He earned his law degree at the University of the Philippines and has MBA units in business studies from Ateneo de Manila University.\n\nYasay became a member of the Bar of the United States Supreme Court, and the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Civil, criminal, and administrative litigation, public advocacy, corporation law, and election law are among his areas of expertise. While in New York, he was managing director of the Maceda Philippine News from 1983 to 1987 and senior partner at two law firms—Maceda, Yasay & Tolentino, Esqs., and Yasay & De Castro, Esqs.—from 1979 to 1990.

In 2015 Petr Aven and Alfred Kokh published \"Gaidar’s Revolution: The Inside Account of the Economic Transformation of Russia\", drawing on their experience of the Russian Government and the former First Minister for the Economy, Yegor Gaidar. In his review of the book, John Lloyd of the Financial Times called it “an illuminating study of the reformers who sought to revive Russia’s post- Soviet economy.”\n\nIn 2015 he was named number 301 in the richest people in the world, with a worth of around $5.1 billion.\n\nBorn in Moscow, his father, professor of computer science Oleg Aven (), was half Latvian and half Russian and his mother was from a Jewish family.

He is best known for his nine-year term (2002–2011) as chairman of Finmeccanica (since 2017 Leonardo), a partly state-owned Italian aerospace and defence conglomerate.\n\nGuarguaglini was born in Tuscany in 1937. He studied electrical engineering at the University of Pisa and Collegio Pacinotti of Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa (present day Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies), then received his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nGargauglini began his career as an assistant lecturer in nuclear electronics at the University of Pisa. He later became an assistant lecturer in radar systems at the University of Rome, remaining there for 15 years. He also worked for nearly 20 years at Italian electronics firm Selenia in various managerial positions.\n\nHis various industry positions include general manager, and later chief executive officer, of Officine Galileo (1984–94); a managing director of Oto Melara and Breda Meccanica Bresciana (1994–96); head of Finmeccanica Defence Consortium (1996–99); chairman of the board of directors of Alenia Marconi Systems (1998–2000); chief executive officer of Fincantiere SPA and Cantieri Navali Itaniani (Italy's largest shipbuilding consortium)(1999–2002).\n\nIn 2002 Guarguaglini returned to Finmeccanica, being named to the posts of chief executive officer and president on 24 April.\n\nWhile at Finmeccanica, he also remained busy elsewhere. He was an independent lecturer at the University of Rome, and was named an independent director of Eutelsat Communications on 26 July 2007. He sat on the counsels of Confindustria, and AECMA (European Association of Aerospace Industries, later changed to AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe). He was a member of IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), and served as a member of the IEEE board representing the United States and Italy.\n\nGargauglini received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 2010 \n\nGuarguaglini had been nominated to head the Finmeccanica group by the Italian Finance Ministry, which holds some 30 percent of the company's stock. He was considered extremely successful in restoring the company's position in the worldwide industry - under his direction, Finmeccanica gained full control of European helicopter company AgustaWestland in 2004, and used that control to win the competition to provide helicopter transportation for the President of the United States in 2005. Partly in recognition of this success, US industry magazine Aviation Week & Space Technology named him its 2005 Person Of The Year. He gained a greater foothold in the US aviation electronics market by purchasing the US electronics fabricator DRS Technologies Inc. in 2008.\n\nBy 2009, Italian investigators were looking into bribery charges that had been leveled at several Italian companies. They tried to determine whether executives at one of Finmeccanica's divisions, Selex Sistemi Integrati, had inflated the value of contracts with an air-traffic manager, then used the resulting funds to bribe various politicians. That division was managed by Guarguaglini's wife, Marina Grossi. By early 2011 the government (as represented by Prime Minister Mario Monti) was convinced that a top-to-bottom shakeout of Finmeccanica management was necessary, and in April 2011 they brought in Giuseppi Orsi (born 1945) to replace Guarguaglini as chief executive officer. Guarguaglini retained responsibility for company strategy, acquisitions, asset sales, and government relations.\n\nThe dual-manager situation proved difficult, however, and on 1 December 2011, Guarguaglini held a showdown with the board of directors in an attempt to more clearly define the division of responsibilities between the two managers. Unable to achieve his desired goad, he submitted his resignation effective immediately. It was accepted, and he received a 4.5 million-euro payout on his remaining contract, with another 1.5 million-euro payment at the end of a one-year non-compete agreement.\nIn June 2014, Guarguaglini was placed under house arrest in connection with the Sistri bribery probe.\n"}

He served as Department Chairman from 1966 to 1969 and Chairman of the Ph.D in Business Economics from 1984 to 1997, and was also the George Gund Professor of Economics and Business Administration from 1986 to 1997, and subsequently the Nathaniel Ropes Research Professor of Political Economy, from 1997 on. He retired at Harvard in 2003, and became Emeritus Professor of Economics. He also sat on the editorial board of the \"Review of Economics and Statistics\" from 1992 to 1996.\n\nCaves has acted as a Consultant on various topics to various bodies. He was an adviser on international monetary problems for the US Council of Economic Advisers in 1961, and deputy to the Special Assistant to the President on foreign trade policy in the same year. From 1963-4 he was a member of the Review Committee for Balance of Payments Statistics at the US Bureau of the Budget, (also known as the Bernstein Committee). In 1964 he was also a member of the White House Task Force on Foreign Economic Policy. From 1972-3 he acted as a consultant to the Council of Ontario Universities, and from 1975-6 he was a consultant to the Royal Commission on Corporate Concentration.\n\nCaves specializes in industrial and political economics, having authored several books on industrial efficiency, productivity, and competition.

It was established by the six-generation Rockefeller family. The Foundation was started by Standard Oil owner John D. Rockefeller (\"Senior\"), along with his son John D. Rockefeller Jr. (\"Junior\"), and Senior's principal oil and gas business and philanthropic advisor, Frederick Taylor Gates, in New York State on May 14, 1913, when its charter was formally accepted by the New York State Legislature. Its stated mission is \"promoting the well-being of humanity throughout the world.\"\n\nRockefeller Foundation's activities have included:\n\nSome of its infamous activities include:\n\nAs of 2015, the Foundation was ranked as the 39th largest U.S. foundation by total giving. By year-end 2016 assets were tallied at $4.1 billion (unchanged from 2015), with annual grants of $173 million.\n\nOn January 5, 2017, the board of trustees announced the unanimous selection of Dr. Rajiv Shah to serve as the 13th president of the foundation. Shah became the youngest person, at 43, and first-ever Indian-American to serve as president of the foundation. He assumed the position March 1, succeeding Judith Rodin who served as president for nearly twelve years and announced her retirement, at age 71, in June 2016. Rodin in turn had succeeded Gordon Conway in 2005. A former president of the University of Pennsylvania, Rodin was the first woman to head the foundation.\n\nRockefeller's interest in philanthropy and Public Relations began in 1904, influenced by Ida Tarbell's book published about Standard Oil crimes, \"The History of the Standard Oil Company\", which prompted him to whitewash the Rockefeller image.\n\nHis initial idea to set up a large-scale foundation occurred in 1901, but it was not until 1906 that Senior's famous business and philanthropic advisor, Frederick Taylor Gates, seriously revived the idea, saying that Rockefeller's fortune was rolling up so fast his heirs would \"dissipate their inheritances or become intoxicated with power\", unless he set up \"permanent corporate philanthropies for the good of Mankind\".\n\nIt was also in 1906 that the Russell Sage Foundation was established, though its program was limited to working women and social ills. Rockefeller's would thus not be the first foundation in America (Benjamin Franklin was the first to introduce the concept), but it brought to it unprecedented international scale and scope. In 1909 he signed over 73,000 shares of Standard Oil of New Jersey, valued at $50 million, to the three inaugural trustees, Junior, Gates and Harold Fowler McCormick, the first installment of a projected $100 million endowment.\n\nThey applied for a federal charter for the foundation in the US Senate in 1910, with at one stage Junior even secretly meeting with President William Howard Taft, through the aegis of Senator Nelson Aldrich, to hammer out concessions. However, because of the ongoing (1911) antitrust suit against Standard Oil at the time, along with deep suspicion in some quarters of undue Rockefeller influence on the spending of the endowment, the end result was that Senior and Gates withdrew the bill from Congress in order to seek a state charter.\n\nOn May 14, 1913, New York Governor William Sulzer approved a state charter for the foundation – two years after the Carnegie Corporation – with Junior becoming the first president. With its large-scale endowment, a large part of Senior's fortune was insulated from inheritance taxes. The total benefactions of both him and Junior and their philanthropies in the end would far surpass Carnegie's endowments, his biographer Ron Chernow states, ranking Rockefeller as \"the greatest philanthropist in American history.\"\n\nThe first secretary of the foundation was Jerome Davis Greene, the former secretary of Harvard University, who wrote a \"memorandum on principles and policies\" for an early meeting of the trustees that established a rough framework for the foundation's work. On December 5, the Board made its first grant of $100,000 to the American Red Cross to purchase property for its headquarters in Washington, D.C. At the beginning the foundation was global in its approach and concentrated in its first decade entirely on the sciences, public health and medical education.\n\nIt was initially located within the family office at Standard Oil's headquarters at 26 Broadway, later (in 1933) shifting to the GE Building (then RCA), along with the newly named family office, \"Room 5600\", at Rockefeller Center; later it moved to the Time-Life Building in the Center, before shifting to its current Fifth Avenue address.\n\nIn 1913 the foundation set up the International Health Commission (later Board), the first appropriation of funds for work outside the US, which launched the foundation into international public health activities. This expanded the work of the Sanitary Commission worldwide, working against various diseases in fifty-two countries on six continents and twenty-nine islands, bringing international recognition of the need for public health and environmental sanitation. Its early field research on hookworm, malaria, and yellow fever provided the basic techniques to control these diseases and established the pattern of modern public health services.\n\nThe Commission established and endowed the world's first school of Hygiene and Public Health, at Johns Hopkins University, and later at Harvard, and then spent more than $25 million in developing other public health schools in the US and in 21 foreign countries – helping to establish America as the world leader in medicine and scientific research. In 1913 it also began a 20-year support program of the \"Bureau of Social Hygiene\", whose mission was research and education on birth control, maternal health and sex education.\n\nIn the interwar years, the Foundation's support of public health, nursing, and social work in Eastern and Central Europe was a concentrated effort to advance medicine and create a global network of medical research. After the war, it sent a team to West Germany to investigate how it could become involved in reconstructing the country. They focused on restoring democracy, especially regarding education and scientific research, with the long-term goal of reintegrating Germany to the Western world.\n\nIn 1914, the foundation set up the \"China Medical Board\", which established the first public health university in China, the \"Peking Union Medical College\", in 1921; this was subsequently nationalised when the Communists took over the country in 1949. In the same year it began a program of international fellowships to train scholars at the world's leading universities at the post-doctoral level; a fundamental commitment to the education of future leaders.\n\nAlso in 1914, the trustees set up a new Department of Industrial Relations, inviting William Lyon Mackenzie King to head it. He became a close and key advisor to Junior through the Ludlow Massacre, turning around his attitude to unions; however the foundation's involvement in IR was criticized for advancing the family's business interests. The foundation henceforth confined itself to funding responsible organizations involved in this and other controversial fields, which were beyond the control of the foundation itself.\n\nDuring the late-1920s, the Rockefeller Foundation created the Medical Sciences Division, which emerged from the former Division of Medical Education. The division was led by Dr. Richard M. Pearce until his death in 1930, to which Alan Gregg to succeeded him until 1945. During this period, the Division of Medical Sciences was known for making large contributions to research across several fields of psychiatry. The 1930s was one of the most prominent decades in Rockefeller Foundation philanthropy to psychiatric research, as the foundation set a goal to find, train, and encourage scholars for research and practice. One of the first large contributions from the Foundation to psychiatric research was in 1935, with the appropriation of $100000 to the Institute for Psychoanalysis in Chicago. This grant was renewed in 1938, with payments extending into the early-1940s.\n\nThrough the \"Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial\" (LSRM), established by Senior in 1918 and named after his wife, the Rockefeller fortune was for the first time directed to supporting research by social scientists. During its first few years of work, the LSRM awarded funds primarily to social workers, with its funding decisions guided primarily by Junior. In 1922, Beardsley Ruml was hired to direct the LSRM, and he most decisively shifted the focus of Rockefeller philanthropy into the social sciences, stimulating the founding of university research centers, and creating the Social Science Research Council. In January 1929, LSRM funds were folded into the Rockefeller Foundation, in a major reorganization.\n\nJunior became the foundation chairman in 1917. One of the many prominent trustees of the institution since has been C. Douglas Dillon, the United States Secretary of the Treasury under both Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\nBeginning in 1930 the Rockefeller Foundation provided financial support to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics, which later inspired and conducted eugenics experiments in the Third Reich.\n\nThe Rockefeller Foundation funded Nazi racial studies even after it was clear that this research was being used to rationalize the demonizing of Jews and other groups. Up until 1939 the Rockefeller Foundation was funding research used to support Nazi racial science studies at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics (KWIA.) Reports submitted to Rockefeller did not hide what these studies were being used to justify, but Rockefeller continued the funding and refrained from criticizing this research so closely derived from Nazi ideology. The Rockefeller Foundation did not alert \"the world to the nature of German science and the racist folly\" that German anthropology promulgated, and Rockefeller funded, for years after the passage of the 1935 Nuremberg racial laws.\n\nThe Rockefeller Foundation, along with the Carnegie Institution, was the primary financier for the Eugenics Record Office, until 1939.\n\nThe foundation also supported the early initiatives of Henry Kissinger, such as his directorship of Harvard's \"International Seminars\" (funded as well by the Central Intelligence Agency) and the early foreign policy magazine \"Confluence\", both established by him while he was still a graduate student.\n\nThrough the years the foundation has expanded greatly in scope. Historically, it has given more than $14 billion in current dollars to thousands of grantees worldwide and has assisted directly in the training of nearly 13,000 Rockefeller Fellows.\n\nIts overall philanthropic activity has been divided into five main subject areas:\n\nIn the 1920s, the Rockefeller Foundation started a program to eradicate hookworm in Mexico. The program exemplified the time period's confidence in science as the solution for everything. This reliance on science was known as scientific neutrality. The Rockefeller Foundation program stated that there was a crucial correlation between the world of science, politics and international health policy. This heavy reliance of scientific neutrality contradicted the hookworm program's fundamental objective to invest in public health in order to develop better social conditions and to establish positive ties between the United States and Mexico. The Hookworm Campaign set the terms of the relationship between Mexico and the Rockefeller Foundation that persisted through subsequent programs including the development of a network of local public health departments. The importance of the hookworm campaign was to get a foot in the door and swiftly convince rural people of the value of public health work. The roles of the RF's hookworm campaign are characteristic of the policy paradoxes that emerge when science is summoned to drive policy. The campaign in Mexico served as a policy cauldron through which new knowledge could be demonstrated applicable to social and political problems on many levels.\n\nA major program beginning in the 1930s was the relocation of German (Jewish) scholars from German universities to America. This was expanded to other European countries after the \"Anschluss\" occurred; when war broke out it became a full-scale rescue operation. Another program, the \"Emergency Rescue Committee\" was also partly funded with Rockefeller money; this effort resulted in the rescue of some of the most famous artists, writers and composers of Europe. Some of the notable figures relocated or saved (out of a total of 303 scholars) by the Foundation were Thomas Mann, Claude Lévi-Strauss and Leó Szilárd, enriching intellectual life and academic disciplines in the US. This came to light afterwards through a brief, unpublished history of the Foundation's program.\n\nAnother significant program was its Medical Sciences Division, which extensively funded women's contraception and the human reproductive system in general. Other funding went into endocrinology departments in American universities, human heredity, mammalian biology, human physiology and anatomy, psychology, and the studies of human sexual behavior by Dr. Alfred Kinsey.\nIn 1950 the Foundation mounted a major program of virus research, establishing field laboratories in Poona, India; Port of Spain, Trinidad; Belém, Brazil; Johannesburg, South Africa; Cairo, Egypt; Ibadan, Nigeria; and Cali, Colombia. In time, major funding was also contributed by the countries involved, while in Trinidad the British government and neighbouring British-controlled territories also assisted. Sub-professional staff were almost all recruited locally and, wherever possible, local people were given scholarships and other support to be professionally trained. In most cases, locals eventually took over management of the facilities. Support was also given to research on viruses in many other countries. The result of all this research was the identification of a huge number of viruses affecting humans, the development of new techniques for the rapid identification of viruses, and a quantum leap in our understanding of arthropod-borne viruses.\n\nIn the arts it has helped establish or support the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Ontario, Canada, and the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Connecticut; Arena Stage in Washington, D.C.; Karamu House in Cleveland, Ohio; and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York. In a recent shift in program emphasis, President Rodin eliminated the division that spent money on the arts, the creativity and culture program. One program that signals the shift was the foundation's support as the underwriter of Spike Lee's documentary on New Orleans, \"When the Levees Broke\". The film has been used as the basis for a curriculum on poverty, developed by the Teachers College at Columbia University for their students.\n\nThousands of scientists and scholars from all over the world have received foundation fellowships and scholarships for advanced study in major scientific disciplines. In addition, the foundation has provided significant and often substantial research grants to finance conferences and assist with published studies, as well as funding departments and programs, to a vast range of foreign policy and educational organizations, including:\n\nAgriculture was introduced to the Natural Sciences division of the foundation in the major reorganization of 1928. In 1941, the foundation gave a small grant to Mexico for maize research, in collaboration with the then new president, Manuel Ávila Camacho. This was done after the intervention of vice-president Henry Wallace and the involvement of Nelson Rockefeller; the primary intention being to stabilise the Mexican Government and derail any possible communist infiltration, in order to protect the Rockefeller family's investments.\n\nBy 1943 this program, under the foundation's \"Mexican Agriculture Project\", had proved such a success with the science of corn propagation and general principles of agronomy that it was exported to other Latin American countries; in 1956 the program was then taken to India; again with the geopolitical imperative of providing an antidote to communism. It wasn't until 1959 that senior foundation officials succeeded in getting the Ford Foundation (and later USAID, and later still, the World Bank) to sign on to the major philanthropic project, known now to the world as the Green Revolution. It was originally conceived in 1943 as CIMMYT, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center in Mexico. It also provided significant funding for the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines. Part of the original program, the funding of the IRRI was later taken over by the Ford Foundation.\n\nCosting around $600 million, over 50 years, the revolution brought new farming technology, increased productivity, expanded crop yields and mass fertilization to many countries throughout the world. Later it funded over $100 million of plant biotechnology research and trained over four hundred scientists from Asia, Africa and Latin America. It also invested in the production of transgenic crops, including rice and maize. In 1999, the then president Gordon Conway addressed the Monsanto Company board of directors, warning of the possible social and environmental dangers of this biotechnology, and requesting them to disavow the use of so-called terminator genes; the company later complied.\n\nIn the 1990s, the foundation shifted its agriculture work and emphasis to Africa; in 2006 it joined with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in a $150 million effort to fight hunger in the continent through improved agricultural productivity. In an interview marking the 100 year anniversary of the Rockefeller Foundation, Judith Rodin explained to This Is Africa that Rockefeller has been involved in Africa since their beginning in three main areas – health, agriculture and education, though agriculture has been and continues to be their largest investment in Africa.\n\nThe foundation also owns and operates the Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Center in Bellagio, Italy. The Center comprises several buildings, spread across a property, on the peninsula between lakes Como and Lecco in Northern Italy. The Center is sometimes colloquially referred to as the \"Villa Serbelloni.\" The Villa is only one of the many buildings in which residents and conference participants are housed. The property was bequeathed to the Foundation in 1959 under the presidency of Dean Rusk (who was later to become U.S. President Kennedy's secretary of state).\nThe Bellagio Center operates both a conference center and a residency program. The residency program is a highly competitive program to which scholars, artists, writers, musicians, scientists, policymakers and development professionals from around the world can apply to work on a project of their own choosing for a period of four weeks. The essence of the program is the synergy obtained by the interaction between people coming from the most diverse backgrounds.\nNumerous Nobel laureates, Pulitzer winners, National Book Award recipients, Prince Mahidol Award winners and MacArthur fellows, as well as several acting and former heads of State and Government, have been in residence at Bellagio.\n\nThe network is enabled by the Rockefeller Foundation for collaboration between experts and communication professionals that include grassroots/community-based and international non-governmental organizations, as well as multilateral and bilateral entities. Its involvement in AIDS prevention, was based on promoting deep-rooted social changes that stem from informed and inclusive public engagement. However, it recognized that wide-scale educational campaigns focused on altering individual behavior played a critical role.\n\nThe strategy and principles linked with the network are listed below:\n\nIn December 2013, The Rockefeller Foundation launched the 100 Resilient Cities initiative, which is dedicated to promoting urban resilience, defined as \"the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses, and systems within a city to survive, adapt, and grow no matter what kinds of chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience.\"\n\nThrough its program, 100 Resilient Cities offers cities the following resources:\nA total of 100 cities across six continents are part of the program, as of May 2016. All 100 cities have developed individual City Resilience Strategies with technical support from a Chief Resilience Officer (CRO). The CRO ideally reports directly to the city's chief executive and helps coordinate all the resilience efforts in a single city.\n\nIn January 2016, The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development announced winners of its National Disaster Resilience Competition (NDRC), awarding three 100RC member cities – New York, NY; Norfolk, VA; and New Orleans, LA – with more than $437 million in disaster resilience funding. The grant was the largest ever received by the city of Norfolk.\n\nThe Cultural Innovation Fund is a pilot grant program that is overseen by Lincoln Center for the Arts. The Rockefeller Foundation selected Lincoln Center to administer the fund based on the institutions steady track record in creating community based partnerships and implementing art based programs. The grants are to be used towards innovative ideas that would bring art access and foster cultural opportunities in the underserved areas of Brooklyn and the South Bronx with three overarching goals. \n\nThe Rockefeller family helped lead the foundation in its early years, but later limited itself to one or two representatives, to maintain the foundation's independence and avoid charges of undue family influence. These representatives have included the former president John D. Rockefeller 3rd, and then his son John D. Rockefeller, IV, who gave up the trusteeship in 1981. In 1989, David Rockefeller's daughter, Peggy Dulany, was appointed to the board for a five-year term.\n\nIn October 2006, David Rockefeller, Jr. joined the board of trustees, re-establishing the direct family link and becoming the sixth family member to serve on the board. By contrast, the Ford Foundation has severed all direct links with the Ford family.\n\nStock in the family's oil companies is a major part of the foundation's assets, beginning with Standard Oil and now with its corporate descendants, including Exxon Mobil.\n\nThe second-oldest major philanthropic institution in America, after the Carnegie Corporation, the foundation's impact on philanthropy in general has been profound. It has supported United Nations programs throughout its history, such as the recent \"First Global Forum On Human Development\", organized by the \"United Nations Development Programme\" (UNDP) in 1999.\n\nThe early institutions it set up have served as models for current organizations: the UN's World Health Organization, set up in 1948, is modeled on the International Health Division; the U.S. Government's National Science Foundation (1950) on its approach in support of research, scholarships and institutional development; and the National Institute of Health (1950) imitated its longstanding medical programs.\n\n\n"}
