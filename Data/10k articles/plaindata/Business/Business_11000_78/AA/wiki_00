The term \"Allgemein\" (\"General\") emphasized the whole German Confederation as the scope of application.\n\nUntil introduction of ADHGB German commercial law reflected the political splintering of Germany.\n\nThe Preußisches Allgemeines Landrecht (ALR) of 1794 (English \"Prussian General Land Law\") applied to Prussian state territory.\nLegal provisions for burgher classes („Bürgerstände“) could be found in Eighth Title (\"Achter Titel\"). This comprised rules for craftsmen (\"Handwerker\") (§§ 179 to 400) in addition to these for artists and fabricants (\"Künstler und Fabrikanten\") (§§ 401 to 423) and for merchants (§§ 475 to 712).\nHere §§ 475 bis 496 ALR defined characteristics of a merchant. §§ 497 bis 545 ALR affected factors and dispatchers (\"Faktoren und Disponenten\") whereby procuration (\"Prokura),\" a special power of attorney, could be found in §§ 498 et seq. ALR.\n\n§§ 546 to 553 ALR dealt with merchant assistant and apprentices (\"Handlungsdienern und Lehrlingen\"), §§ 562 to 613 ALR with trading books (\"Handelsbücher\") and §§ 614 to 683 ALR with companies (\"Handlungsgesellschaften\"). Mecantile interests (\"Kaufmännische Zinsen\") werde regulated by §§ 684 to 697 ALR, brokerages (\"Provisionen\") by §§ 698 to 701 ALR and merchant recommendations (\"Kaufmännische Empfehlungen\") by §§ 702 ti 712 ALR.\n\nIn areas west of the Rhine and in Baden (as an annex to Badisches Landrecht (engl. \"Baden Land Law\") of 1810) French Code de commerce of 1808 ruled.\n\nApart from that Particular law (\"Patrikularrecht\") or subsidiary Common law, here ius commune, (\"Gemeines Recht\") were applied.\n\nPreliminary works for ADHGB can be traced back to 1848/49. \nAlready Paulskirche Constitution of 28 March 1849 provided in § 64 inter alia establishing a General Commercial Code. On 2 December 1848 a commission had started preparations previously.\n\nIn March 1849 finally the „Entwurf eines allgemeinen Handelsgesetzbuches für Deutschland“ (Draft of a general commercial code for Germany) was presented. \nAfter the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm IV had rejected the imperial crown, that he was offered on 4 April 1849, the constitutional project miscarried. In the same year Commission dissolved.\n\nOn a proposal from the Kingdom of Bavaria the Federal Convention (\"Bundesversammlung\" also \"Bundestag\") of the German Confederation establish a commission, that should elaborate a commercial code. That was 21 February 1856. King Maximilian II Joseph of Bavaria is said to have motivated the project in person. The Prussian deputy for the Federal Convention Otto von Bismarck thereby voted not against the application against, what contravene with the instruction form the Prussian Prime Minister Otto Theodor von Manteuffel Also on the suggestion of Bismarck not Frankfurt am Main, Federal Assembly's official seat, but the ancient trading town Nuremberg was chosen as conference venue. So the working group should go down in history as Nuremberg HGB-Commission (\"Nürnberger HGB-Kommission\").\n\nThe commission presided by the Bavarian Ministry of Justice Friedrich von Ringelmann was in session as of January 1857. Also numerous merchants belonged to the commission. \nGerman mercantile community and jurists thereby pronounced against Code de commerce as a model for ADHGB, because it was pre-industrial characterized and thus been overtaken by circumstances.\nInstead a Prussian draft war favoured as a working basis.\n\nOn 31 May 1861 this \"Nuremberg Draft\" (\"„Nürnberger Entwurf“\") of an Allgemeines Deutsches Handelsgesetzbuch (ADHGB) was recommended to be introduced in the individual states by the General Assembly of the German Confederation. As of 1861 ADHGB apllied in German Confederation´s member states as inentical right. Some federal states, like the Free City of Hamburg, even declared ADHGB applicable for legal transactions (\"Rechtsgeschäfte\") without merchant participation.\n\nGerman Confederation was dissolved in Augsburg on 23 August 1866. ADHGB persisted in the former federal states.\n\nNorth German Confederation took over ADHGB by federal act (\"Bundesgesetz\") on 5 June 1869. ADHGB remained in force in German Empire in accordance with Imperial Act (Reichsgesetz) of 16 April 1871. Supreme court for the interpretation of ADHGB was Reichoberhandelsgericht (ROHG, English \"Imperial Higher Commercial Court\", until 1871 Bundesoberhandelsgericht, English \"Federal Higher Commercial Court\"), that later was merged in Reichsgericht (english \"Imperial Court of Justice\").\nADHGB was replaced in German Empire by the Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB, english \"Commercial Code\"), that was legislated on 10 May 1897. The HGB came into force together with the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB) on 1 January 1900.\n\nThe ADHGB was introduced as Allgemeines Handelsgesetzbuch (AHGB) (english General Commercial Code) in the Empire of Austria on 1863(österreichisches Reichsgesetzblatt 1/1863). After establishment of the Republic of Austria it was applied until the annexation to the German Realm on 13 Märch 1938. Then it was gradually replaced by the Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB).\n\nThe Allgemeines Deutsches Handelsgesetzbuch (ADHGB) was assumed by the Principality of Liechtenstein by the act of 16 Septembre 1865. To the present day its binding law.\nLarge parts however were replaced by the Personen- und Gesellschaftsrecht (PGR, english \"Personal and Corporation Law\") on 19 February 1926. The ADHGB has still practical significance for the sectors procurators (\"Prokuristen\"), authorized representative (\"Handlungsbevollmächtigte\"), commercial brokers (\"Handelsmäkler\") and trading activities (\"Handelsgeschäfte\").\n\nWith its basic concept ADHGB pursues preponderantly an objektive system represented by Levin Goldschmidt, that defines merchant (Kaufmann) objektive by means of legally standardized trading activities (Handelsgeschäfte). Orientation on professional conduct according to Johann Heinrich Thöl was clearly rejected.\n\nIn the absence of a \"Allgemeines Deutsches Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch\" (english \"General German Civil Code\") ADHGB included also general rules for representation (\"Stellvertretung\") (Art. 52-56 ADHGB), fulfilling (\"Erfüllung\") (Art. 324-336 ADHGB) and purchase agreement (\"Kaufvertrag\") (Art. 337-359 ADHGB), that should be \"a landmark template\" (\"„richtungweisende Vorlage“\") for future Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB).\n\nThe German jurist Hermann Rösler authored a draft of a commercial code for Japan in 1884, that was influenced by the ADHGB.\n\nTurkish law also was shaped by the ADHGB.\n\nFor Levin Goldschmidt ADHGB was \"the most thoroughly and best of existing European Commercial Codes\" (\"„gründlichste und beste unter den vorhandenen Europäischen Handelsgesetzbüchern“\").\n\nGeneral\n\nSpecial aspects\n"}

In 1984 he started Skara Sommarland, a theme park. \n\nIn 1991, Karlsson and count Ian Wachtmeister started the populist political party \"New Democracy\". Attracting major media attention, and with a patriotic platform, the party received 6.7 percent of the vote in the parliamentary election in September. With no previous political experience, Karlsson suddenly found himself elected to the Riksdag as a Member of Parliament.\n\nWhen \"New Democracy\" imploded due to internal struggles and failed in the 1994 parliamentary election Karlsson went back to being a full-time businessman. He has started the popular Swedish reality television show Fame Factory, (a programme somewhat similar to the British show Pop Idol), in which he played an important role. Many Mariann artists have entered Melodifestivalen, the Swedish qualifications for the Eurovision Song Contest. From 1978 to 2005, approximately 120 songs from Karlsson's record company competed, and 14 of these went on to represent Sweden in the Eurovision Song contest. Mariann artists include Herreys and Charlotte Perrelli, who went on to win the Eurovision Song Contest (1984 and 1999, respectively).\n\nIn March 2005, Karlsson filled out an application for membership in the Liberal People's Party during a television interview.

Stiviano. In April 2014, website TMZ released an audio recording of a man reported to be Sterling making racial remarks to V. Stiviano, following an Instagram post featuring Stiviano and basketball Hall of Famer Magic Johnson. In the recording, the man believed to be Sterling, is heard saying: \"It bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you're associating with black people. Do you have to?\" and \"You can sleep with [black people]. You can bring them in, you can do whatever you want. The little I ask you is not to promote it on that ... and not to bring them to my games.\"\n\nFollowing a public outcry, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver announced that Sterling would receive a lifetime ban from the NBA, fined $2.5 million by the league, and forced to sell the team.

{"id": "76772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76772", "title": "Bono", "text": "Bono\n\nPaul David Hewson, KBE OL (born 10 May 1960), known by his stage name Bono (), is an Irish singer-songwriter, musician, venture capitalist, businessman, and philanthropist. He is best known as the lead vocalist and primary lyricist of rock band U2.\n\nBono was born and raised in Dublin, Ireland. He attended Mount Temple Comprehensive School where he met his future wife, Alison Stewart, as well as schoolmates with whom he founded U2 in 1976. Bono soon established himself as a passionate frontman for the band through his expressive vocal style and grandiose gestures and songwriting. His lyrics are known for their social and political themes, and for their religious imagery inspired by his Christian beliefs. During U2's early years, Bono's lyrics contributed to the group's rebellious and spiritual tone. As the band matured, his lyrics became inspired more by personal experiences shared with the other members. As a member of U2, Bono has received 22 Grammy Awards and has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nBono is well known for his activism for social justice causes, both through U2 and as an individual. He is particularly active in campaigning for Africa, for which he co-founded DATA, EDUN, the ONE Campaign, and Product Red. In pursuit of these causes, he has participated in benefit concerts and met with influential politicians. Bono has been praised for his philanthropic efforts; he was granted an honorary knighthood by Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom for \"his services to the music industry and for his humanitarian work\", and has been made a Commandeur of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (Order of Arts and Letters). In 2005, Bono was named one of the \"Time\" Persons of the Year.\n\nOutside the band, he has recorded with numerous artists. He has collaborated with U2 bandmate the Edge on several projects, including: songs for Roy Orbison and Tina Turner; the soundtracks to the musical \"\" and a London stage adaptation of \"\"; and the refurbishment of the Clarence Hotel in Dublin. He is Managing Director and a Managing Partner of the private equity firm Elevation Partners, which has invested in several companies.\n\nBono was born in the Rotunda Hospital, Dublin, on 10 May 1960. He was raised in the Northside suburb of Finglas with his brother (who is eight years older than Bono) by their mother, Iris (née Rankin), a member of the Church of Ireland, and their father, Brendan Robert \"Bob\" Hewson, a Roman Catholic. His parents initially agreed that the first child would be raised Anglican and the second Catholic. Although Bono was the second child, he also attended Church of Ireland services with his mother and brother.\nHe went to the local primary Glasnevin National School. Bono's mother died on 10 September 1974, after suffering a cerebral aneurysm at her father's funeral. Many U2 songs, including \"I Will Follow\", \"Mofo\", \"Out of Control\", \"Lemon\" and \"Tomorrow\" focus on the loss of his mother.\n\nBono attended Mount Temple Comprehensive School, a multi-denominational school in Clontarf. During his childhood and adolescence, Bono and his friends were part of a surrealist street gang called \"Lypton Village\". Bono met one of his closest friends, Guggi, in Lypton Village. The gang had a ritual of nickname-giving. Bono had several names: first, he was \"Steinhegvanhuysenolegbangbangbang\", then just \"Huyseman\", followed by \"Houseman\", \"Bon Murray\", \"Bono Vox of O'Connell Street\", and finally just \"Bono\". \"Bono Vox\" is an alteration of \"Bonavox\", a Latin phrase which translates to \"good voice\". It is said he was nicknamed \"Bono Vox\" by his friend Gavin Friday. He initially disliked the name; however, when he learned it translated to \"good voice\", he accepted it. Hewson has been known as \"Bono\" since the late 1970s. Although he uses Bono as his stage name, close family and friends also refer to him as Bono, including fellow band members.\n\nAfter he left school, his father Bob Hewson, told him he could live at home for one year but if he was not able to pay his own way, he would have to leave the house.\n\nBono is married to activist and businesswoman Alison Hewson (née Stewart). The couple have four children: daughters Jordan (born 10 May 1989) and Memphis Eve (7 July 1991) and sons Elijah Bob Patricius Guggi Q (17 August 1999) and John Abraham (20 May 2001).\n\nBono was a close friend to INXS frontman Michael Hutchence.\n\nBono is almost never seen in public without sunglasses, as he suffers from glaucoma. During a \"Rolling Stone\" interview he stated:\n\nIn the late 1980s or early 90s, Bono bought a top-floor duplex apartment in Manhattan's San Remo apartment building from Steve Jobs for $15 million. Jobs had renovated it for his own use, but never moved in. In 2004, Bono was given an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nIn May 2010, Bono suffered a spinal injury while preparing for a U2 tour, and was taken to a German clinic in Munich for emergency neurosurgery. The North American leg of the tour was postponed and rescheduled for 2011.\n\nBono was named one of the 17 Irish artists to be proud of by the \"Irish Post\" on 9 April 2013. \"Time\" magazine ranked him at the 8th place on its list of the \"Most Influential Celebrities\" in 2013; he was the only person from the music industry in the Top 10.\n\nBono's work as an activist, which is due largely to his Christian beliefs, began in earnest when, inspired by Live Aid, he travelled to Ethiopia to work in a feeding camp with his wife Alison and the charity World Vision, an Evangelical Christian humanitarian aid, development, and advocacy organisation. With regard to Bono's 2013 declarations in interviews published and videotaped of his faith in Jesus Christ, he states that Christ was either who he said he was, or he is \"a complete and utter nutcase\". As early as 2005, Bono was invoking this argument, identified as the \"Lewis trilemma\".\n\nOn 16 November 2014, Bono was involved in a \"high energy bicycle accident\" when he attempted to avoid another rider. Bono was rushed to NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center's Emergency Department and underwent \"multiple X-rays and CAT scans\" followed by five hours of surgery. Bono suffered fractures of the shoulder blade, humerus, orbit and pinky finger. Orthopedic trauma surgeon Dean Lorich, MD, stated that \"[Bono] was taken urgently to the operating room... where the elbow was washed out and debrided, a nerve trapped in the break was moved and the bone was repaired with three metal plates and 18 screws.\" Bono posted to U2's official website, \"As I write this, it is not clear that I will ever play guitar again,\" as reported in \"Cycling Weekly\".\n\nOn 25 September 1976, Bono, David Evans (\"The Edge\"), his brother Dik and Adam Clayton responded to an advertisement on a bulletin board at Mount Temple posted by fellow student Larry Mullen Jr. to form a rock band. The band had occasional jam sessions in which they did covers of other bands. Tired of long guitar solos and hard rock, Bono wanted to play The Rolling Stones and Beach Boys songs. The band could not play covers very well, so they started writing their own songs.\n\nThe band went by the name \"Feedback\" for a few months, before changing to \"The Hype\" later on. After Dik Evans left the group to join another local band, the Virgin Prunes, the remaining four officially changed the name from \"The Hype\" to \"U2\". Initially Bono sang, played guitar and wrote the band's songs. He said of his early guitar playing in a 1982 interview, \"When we started out I was the guitar player, along with the Edge—except I couldn't play guitar. I still can't. I was such a lousy guitar player that one day they broke it to me that maybe I should sing instead. I had tried before, but I had no voice at all. I remember the day I found I could sing. I said, 'Oh, that's how you do it.'\" When The Edge's guitar playing improved, Bono was relegated mostly to the microphone, although he occasionally still plays rhythm guitar and harmonica. As of 2006, Bono has taken piano lessons from his children's piano teacher as a means to improve his songwriting.\nBono writes the lyrics for almost all U2 songs, which often have social and political themes. His lyrics frequently allude to a religious connection or meaning, evident in songs such as \"Gloria\" from the band's album \"October\" and \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\" from \"The Joshua Tree\". During the band's early years, Bono was known for his rebellious tone which turned to political anger and rage during the band's \"War\", \"The Joshua Tree\" and \"Rattle and Hum\" eras. Following the Enniskillen bombing that left 11 dead and 63 injured on 8 November 1987, the Provisional IRA paramilitaries threatened to kidnap Bono. IRA supporters also attacked a vehicle carrying the band members. These acts were in response to his speech condemning the Enniskillen bombing during a live performance of \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\". The singer had been advised to cut his on-stage outburst from the \"Rattle and Hum\" film, but it was left in. Also featured in the film is footage of Bono spray-painting a monument during an outdoor performance; Bono was forced to pay a fine.\nU2's sound and focus dramatically changed with their 1991 album, \"Achtung Baby\". Bono's lyrics became more personal, inspired by experiences related to the private lives of the members of the band. During the band's Zoo TV Tour several of his stage personas were showcased; these included \"The Fly\", a stereotypical rock star; \"Mirror Ball Man\", a parody of American televangelists; and \"MacPhisto\", a combination of a corrupted rock star and the Devil.\n\nDuring performances, Bono attempts to interact with the crowd as often as possible. He is known for pulling audience members onto the stage or moving himself down to the physical level of the audience. At the Live Aid concert in 1985, Bono leapt off the stage and pulled a woman from the crowd to dance with her as the band played \"Bad\". In 2005, during U2's Vertigo Tour stop in Chicago, he pulled a boy onto the stage during the song \"An Cat Dubh / Into the Heart\". Bono has often allowed fans to come on stage and perform songs with the band.\n\nBono has won numerous awards with U2, including 22 Grammy awards and the 2003 Golden Globe award for best original song, \"The Hands That Built America\", for the film \"Gangs of New York\". During the live broadcast of the Golden Globe ceremony, Bono called the award \"really, really fucking brilliant!\". In response, the Parents Television Council condemned Bono for his profanity and started a campaign for its members to file complaints with the FCC. Although Bono's use of \"fuck\" violated FCC indecency standards, the FCC refused to fine NBC because the network did not receive advance notice of the consequences of broadcasting such profanity and the profanity in question was not used in its literal sexual meaning.\nIn apparent reaction to the refusal, a group of congressmen introduced House Resolution 3687, the \"Clean Airwaves Act\", on 8 December 2003, aiming to amend to provide an explicit list of profane words and phrases and remove ambiguity that could enable certain uses of the phrases to be allowed. The bill was not enacted.\nThe incident has had a long-term impact in the handling of profanity on live broadcasts.\nIn 2005, the U2 band members were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in their first year of eligibility. In November 2008, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked Bono the 32nd-greatest singer of all time. In 2015, the magazine ranked Bono and the Edge at number 35 on its list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time.\n\nU2 were criticised in 2007 for moving part of their multimillion-euro song catalogue from Ireland to Amsterdam six months before Ireland ended a tax exemption on musicians' royalties. Under Dutch tax law, bands are subject to low to non-existent tax rates. U2's manager, Paul McGuinness, stated that the arrangement is legal and customary and businesses often seek to minimise their tax burdens. The move prompted criticisms in the Irish parliament. The band later responded by stating that approximately 95% of their business took place outside Ireland, and that they were taxed globally because of this. Bono was one of several wealthy figures whose tax arrangements were singled out for criticism in a report by the charity Christian Aid in 2008.\n\nIn addition to his work with U2, Bono has collaborated with Frank Sinatra, Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Luciano Pavarotti, Sinéad O'Connor, Green Day, Tom Petty, Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan, Patti Smith, Tina Turner, B.B. King and Zucchero. He has recorded with Ray Charles, Quincy Jones, Kirk Franklin, Bruce Springsteen, Tony Bennett, Clannad, The Corrs, Wyclef Jean, Kylie Minogue, Carl Perkins, Herbert Grönemeyer, Jay-Z and Rihanna, as well as reportedly completing an unreleased duet with Jennifer Lopez. On Robbie Robertson's 1987 eponymous album, he plays bass guitar and vocals. On Michael Hutchence's 1999 posthumous eponymous album, Bono completed a recording of \"Slide Away\" as a duet with Hutchence. Bono collaborated with African stars D'banj, Waje and Omotola Jalade Ekeinde for a women's empowerment song entitled \"Strong Girl\".\n\nBono and the Edge also wrote the music and lyrics for the Broadway musical \"\". On 25 May 2011, a single titled \"Rise Above 1\" by Reeve Carney featuring Bono and The Edge was released digitally. The music video was released on 28 July 2011.\n\nBono has become one of the world's best-known philanthropic performers and was named the most politically effective celebrity of all time by the \"National Journal\". He has been dubbed, \"the face of fusion philanthropy\", both for his success enlisting powerful allies from a diverse spectrum of leaders in government, religious institutions, philanthropic organisations, popular media, and the business world, as well as for spearheading new organizational networks that bind global humanitarian relief with geopolitical activism and corporate commercial enterprise.\n\nIn a 1986 interview with \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, Bono explained that he was motivated to become involved in social and political causes by seeing one of the \"Secret Policeman's Ball\" benefit shows, staged by John Cleese and producer Martin Lewis for the human-rights organisation Amnesty International in 1979. \"I saw 'The Secret Policeman's Ball' and it became a part of me. It sowed a seed...\". In 2001, Bono arranged for U2 to videotape a special live performance for that year's Amnesty benefit show.\n\nIn 1984, Bono sang on the Band Aid single \"Do They Know it's Christmas?/Feed the World\" (a role that was reprised on the 2004 Band Aid 20 and 2014 Band Aid 30 singles of the same name). Bob Geldof and Bono later collaborated to organise the 2005 Live 8 project, where U2 also performed.\nBono and U2 performed on Amnesty's Conspiracy of Hope tour of the United States in 1986 alongside Sting. U2 also performed in the Band Aid and Live Aid projects, organised by Geldof.\nSince 1999, Bono has become increasingly involved in campaigning for third-world debt relief and raising awareness of the plight of Africa, including the AIDS pandemic. In the past decade Bono has met with several influential politicians, including former United States President George W. Bush and former Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin. During a March 2002 visit to the White House, after President Bush unveiled a $5 billion aid package, he accompanied the President for a speech on the White House lawn where he stated, \"This is an important first step, and a serious and impressive new level of commitment. (...) This must happen urgently, because this is a crisis.\" In May of that year, Bono took US Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill on a four-country tour of Africa. In contrast, in 2005, Bono spoke on CBC Radio, alleging then Prime Minister Martin was being slow about increasing Canada's foreign aid.\n\nIn 2004, he was awarded the Pablo Neruda International Presidential Medal of Honour from the Government of Chile. \"Time\" Magazine named Bono one of the \"100 Most Influential People\" in its May 2004 special issue and again in the 2006 Time 100 special issue. In 2005, \"Time\", named Bono, with Bill and Melinda Gates, a Person of the Year. Also in 2005, he received the Portuguese Order of Liberty for his humanitarian work. That year Bono was also among the first three recipients of the TED Prize, which grants each winner \"A wish to change the world\". Bono made three wishes, the first two related to the ONE campaign and the third that every hospital, health clinic and school in Ethiopia should be connected to the Internet. TED rejected the third wish as being a sub-optimal way for TED to help Africa and instead organised a TED conference in Arusha, Tanzania. Bono attended the conference, which was held in June 2007.\n\nIn 2005, he recorded a version of \"Don't Give Up\" with Alicia Keys, with proceeds going to Keep a Child Alive. On 3 April 2005, Bono paid a personal tribute to John Paul II and called him \"a street fighter and a wily campaigner on behalf of the world's poor. We would never have gotten the debts of 23 countries completely cancelled without him.\" Bono spoke in advance of President Bush at the 54th Annual National Prayer Breakfast, held at the Hilton Washington Hotel on 2 February 2006. In a speech containing biblical references, Bono encouraged the care of the socially and economically depressed. His comments included a call for an extra one percent tithe of the United States' national budget. He brought his Christian views into harmony with other faiths by noting that Christian, Jewish, and Muslim writings all call for the care of the widow, orphan, and stranger. President Bush received praise from the singer-activist for the United States' increase in aid for the African continent. Bono continued by saying much work is left to be done to be a part of God's ongoing purposes.\nAlso in 2005, Bono, Ali Hewson and designer Rogan Gregory co-founded the EDUN fashion label (\"nude\" spelled backwards, to suggest both \"natural\" and the Garden of Eden). It was intended to help bring about positive change in Africa through a fair trade-based relationship rather than by direct aid.\n\nOn 15 December 2005, Paul Theroux published an op-ed in \"The New York Times\" called \"The Rock Star's Burden\" (cf. Kipling's \"The White Man's Burden\") that criticised stars such as Bono, Brad Pitt, and Angelina Jolie, labelling them as \"mythomaniacs, people who wish to convince the world of their worth.\" Theroux, who lived in Africa as a Peace Corps Volunteer, added that \"the impression that Africa is fatally troubled and can be saved only by outside help—not to mention celebrities and charity concerts—is a destructive and misleading conceit.\" Elsewhere, Bono has been criticised, along with other celebrities, for \"[ignoring] the legitimate voices of Africa and [turning] a global movement for justice into a grand orgy of narcissistic philanthropy\".\nIn 2007, Bono was named in the UK's New Years Honours List as an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire. He was formally granted knighthood on 29 March 2007 in a ceremony at the residence of British Ambassador David Reddaway in Dublin, Ireland.\n\nBono also received the NAACP Image Award's chairman's Award in 2007. On 24 May 2007, the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia announced that Bono would receive the Philadelphia Liberty Medal on 27 September 2007 for his work to end world poverty and hunger. On 28 September 2007, in accepting the Liberty Medal, Bono said, \"When you are trapped by poverty, you are not free. When trade laws prevent you from selling the food you grew, you are not free ... When you are a monk in Burma this very week, barred from entering a temple because of your gospel of peace ... well, then none of us are truly free\". Bono donated the $100,000 prize to the organisation. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala accepted the award for the Washington-based Debt AIDS Trade Africa.\n\nThe organisation DATA (Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa) was established in 2002 by Bono and Bobby Shriver, along with activists from the Jubilee 2000 Drop the Debt Campaign. DATA aims to eradicate poverty and HIV/AIDS in Africa. DATA encourages Americans to contact senators and other legislators and elected officials to voice their opinions.\n\nBono was a special guest editor of the July 2007 issue of \"Vanity Fair\" magazine. The issue was named \"The Africa Issue: Politics & Power\" and featured an assortment of 20 different covers, with photographs by Annie Leibovitz of a number of prominent celebrities, political leaders, and philanthropists. Each one showcased in the issue for their contributions to the humanitarian relief in Africa.\nIn an article in Bloomberg Markets in March 2007, journalists Richard Tomlinson and Fergal O'Brien noted that Bono used his band's 2006 Vertigo world tour to promote his ONE Campaign while at the same time \"U2 was racking up $389 million in gross ticket receipts, making Vertigo the second-most lucrative tour of all time, according to Billboard magazine ... Revenue from the Vertigo tour is funnelled through companies that are mostly registered in Ireland and structured to minimise taxes.\"\n\nFurther criticism came in November 2007, when Bono's various charity campaigns were targeted by Jobs Selasie, head of African Aid Action. Selasie claimed that these charities had increased corruption and dependency in Africa because they failed to work with African entrepreneurs and grassroots organisations, and as a result, Africa has become more dependent on international handouts. Bono responded to his critics in \"Times Online\" on 19 February 2006, calling them \"cranks carping from the sidelines. A lot of them wouldn't know what to do if they were on the field. They're the party who will always be in opposition so they'll never have to take responsibility for decisions because they know they'll never be able to implement them.\"\n\nIn November 2007, Bono was honoured by \"NBC Nightly News\" as someone \"making a difference\" in the world. He and anchor Brian Williams had travelled to Africa in May 2007 to showcase the humanitarian crisis on the continent. On 11 December 2008, Bono was given the annual Man of Peace prize, awarded by several Nobel Peace Prize laureates in Paris, France.\n\nProduct Red is another initiative begun by Bono and Bobby Shriver to raise money for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. Bobby Shriver has been announced as the CEO of Product Red, while Bono is currently an active public spokesperson for the brand. Product Red is a brand that is licensed to partner companies, such as American Express, Apple, Converse, Motorola, Microsoft, Dell, The Gap and Giorgio Armani. Each company creates a product with the Product Red logo and a percentage of the profits from the sale of these labelled products will go to the Global Fund.\n\nIn 2016, \"Glamour\" named him \"Man of the Year\", breaking the 26-year tradition that saw the \"Woman of the Year\" accolade reserved only for women. Bono was recognized for establishing a campaign called \"Poverty is Sexist,\" which is \"specifically aimed at helping the world's poorest women\".\n\nIn 1992, Bono, along with the Edge, bought and refurbished Dublin's two-star 70-bedroom Clarence Hotel, and converted it into a five-star 49-bedroom hotel. The Edge and Bono have recorded several songs together, exclusive of the band. They also worked on the score for the 2011 rock musical \"\".\n\nIn May 2007, MTV reported that Bono was writing the foreword for a collection of poetry entitled \"Third Rail\". The book's foreword details the meanings of its poetry, stating \"The poets who fill the pews here have come to testify, to bear witness to the mysterious power of rock and roll...Rock and roll is truly a broad church, but each lights a candle to their vision of what it is.\" The collection, edited by poet Jonathan Wells, contains titles such as \"Punk rock You're My Big Crybaby\", \"Variation on a Theme by Whitesnake\" and \"Vince Neil Meets Josh in a Chinese Restaurant in Malibu (After Ezra Pound).\"\n\nBono is on the board of the Elevation Partners private-equity firm, which attempted to purchase Eidos Interactive in 2005 and has since gone on to invest in other entertainment businesses. Bono has invested in the Forbes Media group in the US through Elevation Partners. Elevation Partners became the first outsider to invest in the company, taking a minority stake in Forbes Media LLC, a new company encompassing the 89-year-old business which includes \"Forbes\" magazine, the Forbes.com website and other assets. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but reports said the stake was worth about €194 million ($250m). The firm also owns a 1.5 percent stake in social networking site Facebook, originally purchased for $210m. Although it was reported that Bono's stake was valued at approximately US$ 1 billion in February 2012, a 2015 article in \"Forbes\" stated that this estimate was based on an incorrect attribution of shares.\nBono was among those cited in the Paradise Papers after he was named as a passive minority investor in Nude Estates, which bought a shopping mall in Lithuania in 2007 and transferred ownership to Nude Estates 1 in Guernsey in an apparent attempt to avoid tax. Bono welcomed the subsequent investigation by the Lithuanian tax authority, stating that he welcomed transparency and had personally campaigned for it. Nude Estates paid €53,000 in taxes and fines after the investigation was completed and Bono severed ties with the company.\n\nIn addition to his acting credits Bono has contributed music to films, as part of U2 and other collaborations.\n\n\n"}

It is a subsidiary of Brookfield Property Partners and the successor of General Growth Properties (GGP), which was founded in 1954 and acquired by Brookfield in 2018. Brookfield acquired Rouse Properties in 2016, which was merged into BPRG with the completion of the GGP acquisition. Its portfolio consists of 163 shopping malls in the United States comprising approximately of gross leasable area; this accounts for all of Brookfield's retail properties in the country, except for the retail space at Brookfield Place in New York City, which is managed directly by Brookfield Asset Management.\n\nGeneral Growth was founded in Iowa by three brothers, Martin, Matthew and Maurice Bucksbaum, in 1954 as General Management. That year, they borrowed $1.2 million to develop their first shopping center, Town & Country Shopping Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in order to open a fourth location for the grocery store founded by their father.\n\nBy 1964, the company owned 5 malls and moved its headquarters to Des Moines, Iowa. In 1970, General Management became General Growth Properties (GGP) and became a public company via an initial public offering. In 1984, the company sold its holdings to Equitable Real Estate Investment Management for $800 million in the largest-ever single-asset real estate transaction to date, but retained the property management of the assets. In 1989, the company acquired Center Companies, creating the fourth-largest shopping center management company in the United States.\n\nIn 1993, the company once again became a public company via an initial public offering, raising $400 million. In 1994, the company purchased a 40% interest in Centermark Properties from Prudential Financial. In 1995, the company sold 25% of its 40% stake, yielding a profit of over $100 million. In 1995, the company also purchased the Homart Development Company from Sears for $1.85 billion. In 1995, co-founder and CEO Martin Bucksbaum died and the company moved its headquarters from Des Moines to Chicago. In 1999, John Bucksbaum succeeded his father as CEO.\n\nIn 2000, the company moved its headquarters from Des Moines to Chicago. The company occupied a historic building on North Wacker Drive designed by architectural firm Graham, Anderson, Probst & White, that was later demolished. In 2004, the company acquired The Rouse Company, which owned 37 regional shopping malls and Howard Hughes Corporation, a land development company, for $7.2 billion in cash. By 2008, the company had taken on $25 billion in debt and the company was facing required debt payments. John Bucksbaum was ousted as CEO, though he remained chairman of the board, and Adam Metz was named CEO. In December 2008, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman disclosed a 25% ownership stake in the company.\n\nIn 2009, the company missed a deadline to repay $900 million in loans backed by two Las Vegas properties, putting the company in danger of filing for bankruptcy protection. At that point, the stock price was down 98% in 12 months. The Bucksbaum family's stake in the firm, which was worth $2.5 billion in 2005, had declined in value by a similar amount. On April 16, 2009, the company filed one of the largest real estate bankruptcies ever and received $375 million in debtor-in-possession financing from Pershing Square Capital Management, the hedge fund managed by Bill Ackman. In February 2010, Brookfield Asset Management made a $2.625 billion equity investment in the company. In November 2010, the company exited bankruptcy protection. Creditors were paid in full and equity holders made a \"substantial\" recovery of their investment, both of which are unusual in bankruptcy filings. In conjunction with the reorganization, the company spun off Howard Hughes Corporation to its shareholders.\n\nIn December 2010, CEO Adam Metz and President and COO Thomas Nolan left the company and Sandeep Mathrani, formerly the head of the retail division of Vornado Realty Trust, was named CEO. In 2011, the company sold Faneuil Hall for $140 million. In January 2012, the company completed the spin off of The Rouse Company to its shareholders. In 2013, co-founder Matthew Bucksbaum died. In February 2014, Bill Ackman sold his remaining shares in the company back to the company for $556 million. In April 2015, the company acquired the Crown Building for $1.78 billion. In January 2017, the company changed its name to GGP Inc.\n\nRouse Properties was formed in 2011 as a corporate spin-off of General Growth Properties. On January 13, 2012, the company became a public company. In February 2012, the company acquired Grand Traverse Mall for $66 million. In January 2013, the company acquired The Mall at Turtle Creek in Jonesboro, Arkansas for $96 million. In May 2014, the company began a $40 million renovation of NewPark Mall in Newark, California. In March 2015, the company defaulted a loan secured by Vista Ridge Mall in Lewisville, Texas. In November 2015, the company acquired The Shoppes at Carlsbad in Carlsbad, California. On July 6, 2016, the company was acquired by Brookfield Asset Management.\n\nOn August 28, 2018, Brookfield Property Partners acquired GGP for $9 billion in cash as well as units in the new company, Brookfield Property REIT. The transaction reunited the malls spun off in the Rouse Properties spinoff with the GGP malls. Upon closing the acquisition, Brookfield immediately sold a 49% interest in each of three former GGP super-regional malls to CBRE Group, and a 49% interest in three other former GGP malls to TIAA subsidiary Nuveen, seeking additional joint ventures for its newly-acquired malls.\n\nThe following is a list of properties owned by the company:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was the originator of Krating Daeng () and was co-creator of the Red Bull brands of energy drinks. At the time of his death in 2012 at the age of 88, he was listed as the third-richest person in Thailand, with an estimated net worth of US$5 billion.\n\nVarious news sources suggest Chaleo was born in central Thailand at some point between 1922 and 1932. \"The New York Times\" notes that three birthdates have been put forward by different sources: \"\"The Nation\", a Thai newspaper, reported that he was 90, while several other news media outlets in Thailand said he was 88. \"Forbes\" recently put his age at 80.\" BBC News states, \"Mr Chaleo was born of poor Chinese immigrant parents in the northern province of Phichit, reportedly in 1932, local media say\". \"The Australian\" and \"Time\" say he was 89. \"The Telegraph\" and \"The Independent\" say he was born in 1923 to a poor Thai-Chinese family that raised ducks and traded fruit in Phichit. His father was an immigrant from Hainan.\n\nWith little formal education, he worked for his parents, then moved to Bangkok. He became an antibiotics salesman, before quitting to set up his own small pharmaceutical company, TC Pharmaceuticals, in the early-1960s. Later, after a claimed stroke of \"divine inspiration\", he developed an energy-boosting beverage that was first introduced in 1976. The logo depicts two large, red bulls charging each other, which are not cattle, but wild gaur, a bovine species native to Southeast Asia called \"krathing\" (กระทิง) in Thai. \n\nDietrich Mateschitz, an Austrian salesman for a German company, found the drink cured his jet lag, and entered into partnership with Chaleo in 1984.

Each put up US$500,000 for 49 per cent of the Red Bull energy drink franchise, with Chaleo's son, Chalerm, owning the remaining two per cent. Chaleo continued to own TC Pharmaceuticals, which manufactured other energy drinks in Thailand, and was part-owner of Piyavate Hospital, a private hospital in Thailand.\n\nThe Yoovidhya family co-owns the sole authorized importer of Ferrari cars into Thailand.\n\nChaleo died in Bangkok on 17 March 2012.\n\n"}
{"id": "879782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=879782", "title": "Cognos", "text": "Cognos\n\nCognos (Cognos Incorporated) was an Ottawa, Ontario-based company making business intelligence (BI) and performance management (PM) software. Founded in 1969, at its peak Cognos employed almost 3,500 people and served more than 23,000 customers in over 135 countries until being acquired by IBM on January 31, 2008. While no longer an independent company, the Cognos name continues to be applied to IBM's line of business intelligence and performance management products.\n\nCognos was founded in 1969 by Alan Rushforth and Peter Glenister. Michael U. Potter joined Cognos in 1972, and was its Chief Executive Officer from 1975 until 1995. It began as a consulting company for the Canadian federal government and offered its first software product, QUIZ, in 1979. During the Canadian recession in the 1980s, Cognos shifted its focus from consulting to software sales.\n\nOriginally Quasar Systems Limited, it adopted the Cognos name in 1982. Cognos is a fragment scissored off the Latin word \"cognosco,\" which means \"knowledge from personal experience\". Cognos became a public company in August 1986 trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange as CSN and on the NASDAQ as COGN. Its independent existence ended on January 31, 2008, when Cognos was acquired by IBM.\n\nIn 1995, Ron Zambonini was named CEO and brought new marketing strategies. Cognos grew successful with its business intelligence products for local area networks (LAN), but new Internet technologies had come into the BI industry faster than the company had anticipated. After Cognos issued a notice informing shareholders of a slowdown in growth, many sold their shares, causing prices to fall quickly.\n\nThis prompted Cognos to build its web technology through the acquisition of other companies rather than internal research and development. In September 2007, Cognos announced that it would be acquiring Applix. It had previously acquired Right Information Systems (4Thought), Interweave (Impromptu Web Query), Relational Matters (DecisionStream), Scientific Time Sharing Corporation (LEX2000), NoticeCast, Adaytum, Frango, DataBeacon, and Celequest.\n\nIn January 2010, as part of a reorganization of IBM Software Group, software from Cognos and recently acquired SPSS were brought together to create the Business Analytics division.\n\nOn December 31, 2013, UNICOM Systems, a division of UNICOM Global acquired the PowerHouse product line including PowerHouse 4GL Server, Axiant® 4GL and PowerHouse Web®, so Powerhouse products would no longer be part of the IBM product set.\n\nIn August 2007, the Massachusetts state Information Technology Division awarded Cognos a $13 million contract for performance management software. This followed a 2006 $4.5 million state contract awarded to Cognos by the Massachusetts Department of Education. These contracts came under scrutiny from the State Ethics Commission and the office of state Inspector General Gregory Sullivan when several conflicts of interest surrounding Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives Salvatore DiMasi and his accountant Richard Vitale came to light.\n\nIn the course of these investigations, a payoff from former Cognos sales executive Joseph Lally in the amount of $600,000 was found to have been made to Vitale's company WN Advisors. Vitale and WN Advisors were not registered as state lobbyists and did not disclose the payments, the bulk of which were apparently made on the same day that the state wired funds for the multimillion-dollar contracts to Cognos. The disposition of the funds has not been disclosed and the State has rescinded the contracts. IBM, who now owns Cognos, has refunded the improperly awarded $13 million paid to Cognos. A second close associate of DiMasi's, lawyer Steven Topazio, was placed on a two-year $5,000 a month retainer for unspecified purposes. This retainer stopped the same month as the second Cognos contract was awarded.\n\nIn addition to the payoffs made to close associates of DiMasi, it is known that Vitale helped arrange a below-market mortgage for DiMasi, which violated state Ethics laws.\n\nOn December 17, 2008, \"The Boston Globe\" confirmed that the State investigations were being joined by a Federal Grand Jury probe investigating the allegations and potential violations of Federal law. On June 2, 2009, DiMasi, Vitale, Lally, and Cognos lobbyist Richard McDonough were indicted \"on a battery of...corruption charges\" as a result of that probe.\n\nIn 2007, following SAP's acquisition of Business Objects and Oracle's acquisition of Hyperion Solutions, IBM announced its acquisition of Cognos in November for $4.9 billion. It continued to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary (Cognos, an IBM company) until January 1, 2009, when it was absorbed into IBM Infosphere product line under IBM Information Management Software brand within the company's Software Group. The software is now called \"IBM Cognos Analytics\" and \"IBM Planning Analytics\" or CA and PA.\n\nIBM's purchase of Cognos and other business intelligence software vendors was a step in establishing IBM as a BI \"megavendor\" (along with Oracle, Microsoft, and SAP). This consolidation may prove beneficial for customers to have fewer vendors to deal with, but this raises concerns about integration of the software as more vendors are bought out by the big four. Another challenge is maintaining the same level of customer service. Gartner interprets the lower ratings given in \"customer experience\" for IBM Cognos and SAP Business Objects as a result of post-acquisition issues. Due to many consolidations in the BI industry, there are only a few independent \"pure-play\" vendors remaining (SAS and MicroStrategy being the largest).\n\nOn October 26, 2015, at the IBM Insight conference in Las Vegas, IBM leadership announced a redesigned user experience for its flagship Cognos Business Intelligence software. The redesign will be version 11 and an upgrade from Cognos Business Intelligence 10.x. The differentiation in the version 11 release also required renaming to IBM Cognos Analytics, based on the same self-service design principles as Watson Analytics. The redesigned Cognos product also features smarter search that works in-context.\n\nOn October 25, 2010, at the Business Analytics Forum in Las Vegas, IBM General Manager for Business Analytics and former Cognos CEO Rob Ashe announced IBM Cognos 10. A significant upgrade to IBM Cognos 8 BI, this new software brings together social collaboration and analytics for business users to gain real-time intelligence in a single, user-friendly interface — online or through mobile devices such as iPad, iPhone and BlackBerry devices.\n\nIBM Cognos 8 BI, initially launched in September 2005, combined the features of several previous products, including ReportNet, PowerPlay, Metrics Manager, NoticeCast, and DecisionStream. There are also Express and Extended versions of Cognos 8 BI. Full features:\n\nIBM Cognos Express, launched in September 2009, is an integrated business intelligence and planning solution purpose-built to meet the needs of midsize companies. The features of Express are:\n\nIBM Cognos also offered several application development tools (which IBM later sold to UNICOM):\n\nIBM Cognos 8 BI has won numerous awards including the eWEEK Excellence Award in Analytics and Reporting, the LOTUS ADVISOR \"Editor's Choice\" Award, and TechTarget's SearchCRM.com 2005 Product of the Year.\n\nIn 2007, Cognos was named one of Canada's Top 100 Employers, as published in Maclean's magazine, one of only a handful of software development companies to receive this honour.\n\nPrior to being acquired, Cognos had been named to the InformationWeek 500, chosen as one of START-IT Magazine's \"Hottest Companies of 2006\" and won \"Best of Information On Demand Showcase\" as part of the IBM Information Management Awards.\n\nCognos, now as IBM Cognos Software, continues to rank in the Leaders quadrant of Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Business Intelligence.\n\n"}

Its mission is to promote business competitiveness, education and quality of life of industrial workers and the whole society, in the state of Rio de Janeiro. FIRJAN System consists of five institutions that work in an integrated manner for the growth of the industry of RJ. Together, FIRJAN, Industrial Center of Rio de Janeiro (CIRJ), Industry Social Service of the State of Rio de Janeiro (SESI Rio), National Industrial Training Service of the State of Rio de Janeiro (SENAI Rio) and Euvaldo Lodi Institute of Rio de Janeiro (IEL Rio) promote actions in economic, political and social levels to ensure a prominent position to the state on the national scenery. Today, all institutions act as service providers to enterprises and society.\n\nFIRJAN System thus acts in an integrated way through the five organizations that comprise it:\n\nFIRJAN develops and coordinates studies, researches and projects to guide the actions of industrial promotion and new investments in the state. Its themed corporate boardrooms and sectoral entrepreneurial forums discuss trends and launch guidelines for actions of support and advice to enterprises. Today, more than 80 industrial unions are affiliated to FIRJAN, representing more than 10,000 businesses around the Rio de Janeiro state.\n\nCIRJ enables the associated companies access (in special conditions) to the services offered by the five institutions of FIRJAN System. Its goal is to promote business competitiveness and protect the interests of members. The service is personalized.\n\nO SENAI Rio promove aprendizagem industrial, qualificação e especialização de trabalhadores por meio de cursos diversos. Possui uma rede de 42 unidades operacionais fixas – entre elas, cinco Centros de Tecnologia de referência nacional e regional – e 30 unidades móveis.\n\nSESI Rio develops actions to promote health, education, sports, leisure and culture targeted to workers, businesses and society in general. The institution also operates in the areas of occupational Safety and Health and environmental protection. It has 30 operating units distributed throughout the state.\n\nIEL Rio promotes business training and develops projects to encourage entrepreneurship, contributing to the industry's modernization and growth. Moreover, it seeks to unite universities and research institutions to the business world.\n\nDirected to businesses' economy and sustainable development, it covers topics that go from micro/macroeconomic and investments to segmented studies in areas such as electrical energy, broadband, natural gas and nanotechnology. And if the interest is the tax management and the development of the municipalities of Brazil, there are the studies \"Fiscal Management FIRJAN Index (IFGF)\" and \"Municipal Development FIRJAN Index (IFDM)\", respectively.\n\nBesides, FIRJAN System awards industrial good manufacturing practices and offers consultancy to companies of all sizes, in various fields (such as legal and environmental). In all actions, its objective is to stimulate \"the generation of new businesses, new markets, access to strategic information for competitiveness improvement, as well as the spread of specialized studies that promote the economic development of enterprises. One of these studies include the periodic analysis of scenarios for the coming years in the Brazilian manufacturing sector, which implies mapping the \"foreign and domestic investments and pointing out opportunities.\" Another study, conducted by the Industry Federation of the State of Rio de Janeiro, was inspired by the creative industry in Brazil to analyze the growth prospects of the professions related to knowledge and innovation in the country.\n\nThis field of activity includes the actions of both SESI Rio and SENAI Rio. \"SESI School\" operates from kindergarten to high school, presenting plays as one of its educational resources. Besides, learning numbers is easier with the playful initiatives of SESI Mathematics program, which applies to SESI schools, SENAI units and public schools as well.\n\nThe professional training targets industry segments such as the automotive, the drinks, the electronic and the graphic.\n\nBoth school courses are enhanced through the \"Connectivity Program\", which employs new educational technologies to improve teaching and learning.\n\nThe technological graduation (upper level) is up to the \"SENAI Rio Faculty\", which trains technicians for the job market.\n\nFor the development of Rio's companies – as regards to management, processes, products and services – there are the \"Technology Centers SENAI Rio\", focused on the areas of automation/simulation, welding, food/drinks and environment. Both for consultancy and for vocational training.\n\nA common activity of the two entities is the \"Conecta Seminar\", which every year gathers authorities, students and teachers to reflect on the role of the teacher and find the best way of incorporating information technology in education. Partnerships with other institutions are also established to strengthen further the education and citizenship programs.\n\nFIRJAN System promotes quality of life through services and programs. The SESI Rio units spread throughout the state offer an infrastructure conducive to leisure, sports, health and culture to society.\n\nIn addition to the actions carried out in its unities, the entity conducts the program \"Global Action\", a campaign that provides services to populations in need of basic services in the areas of health (such as eye examination and identification of blood type), citizenship (such as CPF issuing and legal advice) leisure, culture and sports (such as handicrafts, choral presentation and sports activities). In communities pacified by the UPP, the SESI Citizenship program makes a similar work, i.e., promotes education, sports, leisure and culture to the locals, only permanently and \"in loco\".\n\nWhen the goal is to foment access to art, \"Cultural SESI Rio\" steps in. It is a program that offers music, theater, dance and other activities at popular prices. Noteworthy are the \"SESI's X-Everything Cultural\", annual event that promotes various artistic events with free admission, and the \"SESI In Jazz Festival\", gathering which unites renowned artists and new talents of Jazz.\n\nIn order to foment the Brazilian industry, in 1831 it was founded the \"Helper Society of the National Industry\" (Sain). This private company has served for 50 years as an advisory body to the Federal Government, especially in economic affairs of the Empire of Brazil. In 1850 – with the extinction of the Board of Trade, Agriculture, Factories and Navigation – Sain also became plants and inventions organ granting, which Sain itself considered an obstacle to industrial development.\n\nDiscontented, industrials associated with Sain requested review of statutes and policies so that they met their interests. In Rio, who defended the interests of the textile sector was the \"Industrial Center of Cotton Spinning and Weaving\", but it lacked a body that would unify all representatives of the domestic industry. This happened when Sain joined the Center in 1904 to be the Industrial Center of Brazil (CIB), which strongly advocated the customs tariff.\n\nWith the advent of World War I, Brazil's industry eventually benefited in the medium term. As the country was a great importer of processed products from countries at war and these, in turn, drastically reduced exports to focus in their warfare, Brazil was forced to replace imports, thus expanding national industrial park.\n\n\"Of the 3,400 industrial establishments existing in 1910, it moved 10 years later to 13,600, with the number of workers rising from 150 thousand to 275 thousand, while the industrial output value increased from 769 000 to 3 million \"contos de réis\".\"\n\nIn the 1920s, the country was investing in infrastructure (hydroelectric, ports, telephony and railways) and entrepreneurs imported technology to meet the desire for the most-wanted products at that time. But the big change came a few years later, when Vargas took power in 1930.\n\nTo meet both the workers and the entrepreneurs, he created the \"Ministry of Labour, Industry and Commerce\", an industrial nationalist policy.\n\nIn 1931, the \"Industrial Center of Brazil (CIB)\" became the \"Industrial Federation of Rio de Janeiro (Firj)\" to represent Rio de Janeiro's secondary sector class. Less than two years later the \"Industrial Confederation of Brazil\" (who inherited the acronym \"CIB\") was founded, and in 1938, it became the \"National Confederation of Industry\". In 1937 stepped in the \"Industrial Unions Federation in Federal District (FSIDF)\", which in 1941 was renamed \"Industry Federation of Rio de Janeiro (FIRJ)\".\n\nIt was not by chance that its growth kept on strong during this period: \"The industrial establishments, which were in number 13 thousand in 1920, came to 50,000 in 1940, with the value of industrial production evolving in the same period from 3.2 million to 17.5 million \"contos de réis\".\"\n\nHowever, with the overthrow of Vargas and the entry of Eurico Gaspar Dutra, government investments fell in the second sector, causing the stagnation of the domestic industry. But this \"laissez-faire\" economic policy ceased with the end of dollar reserves, in 1947. Immediately after the World War II, Dutra requested CNI to create the \"Industry Social Service (SESI)\" – to improve the conditions of workers in areas such as housing, health and transport, aiming at social inclusion and citizenship – and the \"National Industrial Training Service (SENAI)\" – to \"imbue workers with the work ethic by which industrials love to be guided\", i.e., order, dedication and commitment. Regional departments of both \"would be operationalized by the state industry federations.\"\n\nIn 1951 Vargas takes power and invests again in the basic industry, transport and energy. It is worth mentioning two major actions in this regard: \n\nAfter the death of Vargas, Juscelino Kubitschek assumed in 1956 and \"announced his \"Plano de Metas\", primarily aimed at the sectors of energy (43.4% of the planned investments), transportation (29 6%), basic industry (20.4%) and food (6.6%).\" With developmentalism on the agenda, ferrous metallurgy, oil production and hydropower grew a lot.\n\nSince then, FIRJ evolved and strengthened its activities: in 1958 it changed its name to Federation of Industries of the Federal District; in 1960 it became Federation of Industries of the State of Guanabara (Fiega) and, in 1975, became known as Federation of Industries of the State of Rio de Janeiro (FIRJAN), the current name. But the FIRJAN System was implemented only in 1994, when united under a single network: FIRJAN, CIRJ and related entities SESI Rio, SENAI Rio and IEL Rio – respectively created in 1975, 1941, 1943, 1946 and 1969.\n\n\n"}

Such a connected world, allows a business’s revenue to not be to be confined by borders. A business can employ a global business strategy to reap the rewards of trading in a worldwide market. \n\nA sound global strategy should address these questions: what must be (versus what is) the extent of market presence in the world's major markets? How to build the necessary global presence? What must be AND (versus what is) the optimal locations around the world for the various value chain activities? How to run global presence into a global competitive advantage? The “International” classification of a global business strategy is employed by companies who may sell in foreign markets, but their primary focus is on their home market. These companies may include international strategies in their business model to increase sales, but they know that their main target consumer is local. \n\nAcademic research on global strategy came during the 1980s, including work by Michael Porter and Christopher Bartlett & Sumantra Ghoshal. Among the forces perceived to bring about the globalization of competition were convergences in economic systems and technological change, especially in information technology, that facilitated and required the coordination of a multinational firm's strategy on a worldwide scale.\n\nA global strategy may be appropriate in industries where firms are faced with strong pressures for cost reduction but with weak pressures for local responsiveness. Therefore, it allows these firms to sell a standardized product worldwide. However, fixed costs (capital equipment) are substantial. Nevertheless, these firms are able to take advantage of scale economies and experience curve effects, because it is able to mass-produce a standard product, which can be exported (providing that demand is greater than the costs involved).\n\nGlobal strategies require firms to tightly coordinate their product and pricing strategies across international markets and locations, and therefore firms that pursue a global strategy are typically highly centralized.\n\nA global strategy involves thinking in an integrated way about all aspects of business-its suppliers, production sites, markets, and competition. It involves assessing every product or service from the perspective of both domestic and international market standards. It means embedding international perspectives in product formulations at the point of design, not as afterthoughts. It means meeting world standards even before seeking world markets and being world class even in local markets. It means deepening the company's understanding of local and cultural differences in order to become truly global. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "2882424", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2882424", "title": "IR35", "text": "IR35\n\nIR35 refers to the United Kingdom's anti-avoidance tax legislation designed to tax \"disguised employment\" at a rate similar to employment. In this context, \"disguised employees\" means workers who receive payments from a client via an intermediary, for example, their own limited company, and whose relationship with their client is such that had they been paid directly they would be employees of the client.\n\nBefore IR35 was introduced, workers who owned their own limited companies were allowed to receive payments from clients direct to the company and to use the company revenue as would any small company. Company profits could be distributed as dividends, which are not subject to National Insurance payments. Workers could also save tax by splitting ownership of the company with family members in order to place income in lower tax bands. (This latter practice was recommended by government publications advising on setting up family businesses, but attacked as tax fraud by other government departments, notably the Treasury. It came under separate, ultimately unsuccessful attack in 2007, see S660A.) Professional advisors now do not recommend that family members are allocated shares in the company unless they perform a significant role in the business (not just the bookkeeping).\n\nOn 20 May 2010, the new Liberal Democrat/Conservative coalition government's \"Programme for Government\" announced a commitment to \"review IR 35, as part of a wholesale review of all small business taxation, and seek to replace it with simpler measures that prevent tax avoidance but do not place undue administrative burdens or uncertainty on the self-employed, or restrict labour market flexibility.\" On 10 March 2011 the Office of Tax Simplification recommended that the Treasury should suspend IR35 or compel HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to make changes to its implementation until wider structural reform to integrate Income Tax and NIC is introduced. After that, the Chancellor announced the Government would keep IR35 'as is' during Budget 2011, but with changes to HMRC administration and to create a new IR35 Forum. This IR35 Forum has achieved little since it was created and there appears to be little interest in the published monthly meeting minutes.\n\nIn 1999, as part of that year’s Budget, the UK’s Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, announced that measures would be introduced to counter tax avoidance by the use of so-called \"personal service companies\". Properly known as the \"Intermediaries Legislation\", it is more commonly referred to by the consecutively numbered Inland Revenue (now HMRC) budget press release number 35 in which it was announced (i.e. the 35th Inland Revenue news release of that budget), titled \"Countering Avoidance in the Provision of Personal Services\". The press release was issued on 9 March 1999, the same day as the Chancellor of the Exchequer's Budget Statement.\n\nIR35 came into force throughout the UK in April 2000. Although it was part of that year's Finance Act and was not law at the start of the Financial Year, the Act backdated its commencement to 6 April 2000. The legislation has been consolidated in the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 and in the Statutory Instrument Social Security Contributions (Intermediaries) Regulations 2000, SI 2000/727. The Finance Act 2017 implements changes in the process for determining the amount of Income Tax and National Insurance to be deducted.\n\nHistorically, it had been advantageous for the owners of a small limited companies to take all of their wages in one month, thereby only incurring NI contributions once (up to the monthly ceiling) instead of paying a regular contribution every month like most employees. This ploy had been circumvented some years prior to the introduction of IR35 by imposing NI on the \"total\" annual income of directors as if it were spread over the year, even if only paid by one payment. The increased usage of dividend payments instead of wages was partly a reaction to this change. An additional sense of grievance felt by those who were driven to incorporate, for whatever reason, was the large disparity between the National Insurance burden on companies and employees (>20% if the employer's contribution is included) and that imposed on the self-employed.\n\nThe stated aim of the measure was to prevent workers from setting up limited companies via which they would work effectively as employees, but saving on Income Tax and National Insurance. The so-called \"Friday to Monday\" scenario, that it was possible for a worker to leave a job on Friday and return on Monday to be doing the same work for the same company, but, as a contractor via their own limited company paying a dividend as opposed to earnings which would incur less Income Tax and no payment of National Insurance and was cited in the press release as the anomaly being corrected. In such a scenario, HM Revenue and Customs would be allowed to \"look through\" the contractual arrangement between the worker’s company and the client company and to formulate a \"hypothetical contract\" which showed that the worker was a \"disguised employee\". The fee paid to the worker’s company would then be taxed as a salary. Normal employment status rules should be applied when considering IR35 status and the view of HM Revenue and Customs can be successfully challenged.\n\nIn reality the majority of one-person limited companies have to operate through an agency. This means that the agency have the contractual agreement with their client to supply an individual. The agency then has a contract with the one-person limited company to supply the services. \nThe responsibility for determining and deducting the correct rates of Income Tax and National Insurance lies with the worker or company but under the Finance Act 2017, where a public authority engages the worker, the responsibility for making this determination and deducting the correct amounts transfers to the public authority for payments made on or after 6 April 2017.\n\nThe term \"personal service company\" is not defined in law, but it is used by the UK government to refer to \"someone who works through their own limited company\" as opposed to someone who is self employed and pays Class 2 and Class 4 National Insurance.\n\nThe main arguments adduced in favour of IR35 are that:\n\nThe \"Friday to Monday\" argument was semi-valid in 1999 when vast numbers of IT contractors fled into contracting as demand increased significantly. To retain the same workers, companies needed to offer them contracts. Although it is worth noting that as contractors they were paid considerably more, and generated more tax than before.\n\nThe argument about workers doing the same tasks paying the same tax is one that has often been used, but it has no basis in law. The type of work being done is irrelevant, and only the nature of the relationship between workers and hirer is examined in the courts.\n\nThe dividend tax regime was changed in April 2016, pretty much wiping out the tax advantage for contractors, who now pay roughly the same amount of tax as an employee when considering the corporation tax and dividend taxes combined. The remaining issue for Government is that hirers do not pay employers NI of 13.8% when hiring the self-employed.\n\nIR35 has been strongly criticised by several bodies, including former Ernst & Young tax partner Anne Redston.\n\nSome of the key criticisms levelled at the measure include:\nIn May 2017, NHS Improvement backtracked on previous guidance that all NHS agency and locum workers would be included in the IR35 taxation laws. The new guidance stated that NHS organisations should assess employees on a \"case by case basis\" . Many NHS locums such as nurses, physiotherapists and doctors below consultant level in the NHS are automatically deemed to be employees. Many workers in the social services sector also supply their services through their own limited companies which would be considered disguised employment by HMRC.\n\nIt is hard to judge the effectiveness of the legislation, since as of 2010 the UK Inland Revenue have not published any figures. On 6 January 2004 Dawn Primarolo was asked in Parliament how many investigations under the IR35 regulation have (a) been initiated, (b) resulted in additional revenue and (c) been concluded without securing additional revenue. In a written answer she replied that it was not possible with any accuracy to isolate data relating solely to this legislation.\n\nOn 15 June 2009 in the House of Commons Labour MP Terry Rooney (Bradford North) asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer \"how many investigations concerning IR35 were launched in each of the last five years; and how many of them resulted in (a) prosecution, (b) an increase in tax due and (c) no further action\". Kitty Ussher speaking for the Chancellor replied, \"The intermediaries legislation, commonly known as 'IR35', was introduced with effect from 6 April 2000 to counter the avoidance of employed levels of tax and national insurance by individuals providing their services through intermediaries. Disclosure of HM Revenue and Customs' compliance data relating to the legislation would result in a risk of non-compliance with the legislation. Accordingly I am not able to provide the data requested.\" The July 2009 issue of \"IT Now\", the British Computer Society magazine, reported that between April 2002 and March 2008 the Government had raised £9.2 million under IR35 legislation compared to the £220 million that it was initially expected.\n\nThe initial regulatory impact assessment for IR35 in 1999 stated that HMRC expected the measure to generate £220 million per year in National Insurance contributions, and a further £80 million in income tax.\n\nOn 6 Jan 2004 Dawn Primarolo was asked by the Shadow Paymaster General Mark Prisk MP about additional revenue secured from investigations under IR35. She replied that \"Establishing whether or not the intermediaries legislation applies is undertaken as part of the Inland Revenue's Employer Compliance Review programme. As such it is not possible with any accuracy to isolate data relating solely to this legislation.\" She gave a similar answer when asked about administration and employment costs.\n\nIn May 2009 the Professional Contractors Group received a reply to a request under the Freedom of Information Act to HMRC, asking just how much tax revenue IR35 had in fact raised for the exchequer. The FOI reply revealed that in the tax years 2002/03 to 2007/08, IR35 directly raised just £9.2 million. This equates to an average of around only £1.5 million per tax year, less than 1% of the expected amount. It is not clear whether this includes the NI contribution, or is just income tax.\n\nIn September 2011 a Freedom of Information Act request revealed that the number of cases reviewed had fallen from 158 (year ending April 2007) to 12 in year ending April 2010 and 23 in year ending April 2011. The same document also gives the \"tax yield received for the requested years\" as having fallen from £1,906,619 to £219,180. No details are given for the costs of the investigations or the costs of collecting the tax. It is not clear whether this figure relates to the revenue raised from investigations, or the total revenue from IR35. No figures were given for the cost of administrating the tax, or the cost of the investigations.\n\n\n"}

It comprises those fields of business administration that are necessary for the success of companies within the manufacturing sector and the encompassing services (primarily operations management, marketing, and financial management).\n\nThe term industrial company is generally applied to a manufacturing firm that – contrary to a crafts business – produces consumer durables in factories from raw materials in mass and serial production (division of labour) using modern manufacturing machines.\n\nThe precursor of the study field industrial management was factory management. It had a strong similarity with technical management and was geared towards the engineering fields. Parallel to this, there was also a factory management that was more in the area of business economics. This dealt with the organizational questions of factory and office administration as well as financial accounting, e.g. the factory bookkeeping and late also management accounting.\n\nThe term and the contents of present-day industrial management were strongly influenced by the establishment of MIT School of Industrial Management in 1952 (renamed the Sloan School of Management in 1964 after its benefactor, Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., MIT graduate and then-chairman of General Motors). MIT School of Industrial Management set itself the goal of educating the \"ideal manager\" through this (post)graduate management program.\n\nGraduate programs in industrial management draw on Sloan’s idea and provide engineers with a strategic management education with a focus on production management, marketing, financial management, human resources as well as commercial law – supplemented by corporate governance, corporate social responsibility and sustainability topics. The primary goal is to enable students and professionals to take a holistic approach to industry management.\n\nMost graduate studies in industrial management are full-time MBA degree programs that, in addition to a preferably engineering bachelor’s degree, also require several years of professional experience. In general, students spend the first year of their degree acquiring both a working knowledge of management functions and the analytical skills needed to practice them. After the second year, students usually seek internships and pursue elective courses, which often go towards a specialization in their master’s thesis.\n\nStudy programs in industrial management are very popular in economies with a high value of manufacturing output, such as the United States and Germany. Especially German research universities incorporate a large number of advanced courses in engineering in their graduate program in industrial management and are, thus, more like M.Eng.- programs. On the other hand, U.S. universities and universities of applied sciences in Germany offer MBA programs in industrial management that follow more the original idea of Sloan and emphasize hands-on application of theory.\n\nIndian institutes such as National Institute of Industrial Engineering (NITIE) Mumbai, offers two year full time residential course PGDIM - Post Graduate Diploma in Industrial Management which is equivalent to MBA.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3578457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3578457", "title": "Institute of Chartered Accountants of India", "text": "Institute of Chartered Accountants of India\n\nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) is the national professional accounting body of India. It was established on 1 July 1949 as a statutory body under the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 enacted by the Parliament (acting as the provisional Parliament of India) to regulate the profession of Chartered Accountancy in India. ICAI is the second largest professional Accounting & Finance body in the world. ICAI is the only licensing cum regulating body of the financial audit and accountancy profession in India. It recommends the accounting standards to be followed by companies in India to National Advisory Committee on Accounting Standards (NACAS). and sets the accounting standards to be followed by other types of organisations. ICAI is solely responsible for setting the Standards on Auditing (SAs) to be followed in the audit of financial statements in India. It also issues other technical standards like Standards on Internal Audit (SIA), Corporate Affairs Standards (CAS) etc. to be followed by practicing Chartered Accountants. It works closely with the Government of India, Reserve Bank of India and the Securities and Exchange Board of India in formulating and enforcing such standards.\n\nMembers of the Institute are known as \"Chartered Accountants\". However, the word chartered does not refer to or flow from any Royal Charter. Chartered Accountants are subject to a published Code of Ethics and professional standards, violation of which is subject to disciplinary action. Only a member of ICAI can be appointed as statutory auditor of a company under the Companies Act, 2013. The management of the Institute is vested with its Council with the president acting as its Chief Executive Authority. A person can become a member of ICAI by taking prescribed examinations and undergoing three years of practical training. The membership course is well known for its rigorous standards. ICAI has entered into mutual recognition agreements with other professional accounting bodies worldwide for reciprocal membership recognition.\nICAI is one of the founder members of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), South Asian Federation of Accountants (SAFA), and Confederation of Asian and Pacific Accountants (CAPA). ICAI was formerly the provisional jurisdiction for XBRL International in India. In 2010, it promoted eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) India as a section 25 company (now section 8 of Companies Act, 2013) to take over this responsibility from it. Now, eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) India is an established jurisdiction of XBRL International Inc.\n\nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants of India was established under the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 passed by the Parliament of India with the objective of regulating accountancy profession in India. ICAI is the third largest professional accounting body in the world in terms of membership only to the ACCA and AICPA. It prescribes the qualifications for a Chartered Accountant, conducts the requisite examinations and grants license in the form of Certificate of Practice. Apart from this primary function, it also helps various government agencies like RBI, SEBI, MCA, CAG, IRDA, etc. in policy formulation. ICAI actively engages itself in aiding and advising economic policy formulation. For example, It has submitted its suggestions on the Companies Bill, 2009. It also examines the various taxation laws, rules, regulations, circulars, notifications, etc. which may be enacted or issued by the Government from time to time and to send suitable memoranda containing suggestions for improvements in the respective legislation. The government also takes the suggestions of ICAI as expert advice and considers it favorably. ICAI presented an approach paper on issues in implementing Goods and Service Tax in India to the Ministry of Finance. In response to this, Ministry of Finance has suggested that ICAI take a lead and help the government in implementing Goods and Services Tax (GST). It is because of this active participation in formulation economic legislation, it has been designated by A. P. J. Abdul Kalam as a \"Partner in Nation Building\".\nNonetheless, with the advent of globalisation and foreign investment, in India, ACCA has constantly gained ground and is currently, standing as tough competition to the ICAI, even though negotiations have been made in the past.\n\nICAI is a founder member of the International Federation of Accountants(IFAC), South Asian Federation of Accountants (SAFA), and Confederation of Asian and Pacific Accountants (CAPA) and International Innovation Network (IIN). ICAI is an Associate member of the Chartered Accountants Worldwide, Member of International Valuation Standards Council (IVSC).\n\nThe motto of the ICAI is Ya Aeshu Suptaeshu Jagruti [Sanskrit]. The motto literally means \"a person who is awake in those that sleep\". It is a quotation from the Upanishads (Kathopanishad). It was given to the ICAI at the time of its formation in 1949 by Sri Aurobindo as a part of its emblem. CA. C. S. Shastri, a Chartered Accountant from Chennai went to Sri Aurobindo and requested him through a letter to give an emblem to the newly formed Institute of which he was an elected member from the Southern India. In reply to this request, Sri Aurobindo gave him the emblem with a Garuda, the mythical eagle in the centre and a quotation from the Upanishad:Ya Aeshu Suptaeshu Jagruti. The emblem along with the motto was placed at the first meeting of the Council of the Institute and was accepted amongst many other emblems placed by other members of the Council.\n\nApart from its emblem, ICAI also has a separate logo for its members. As a part of a brand building exercise, ICAI introduced this separate new CA logo for the use of its members in 2007. The logo is free for use by all members of ICAI subject to certain conditions. The logo was launched by the then Minister of Corporate Affairs, Prem Chand Gupta at the occasion of the Chartered Accountant Day (1 July) in the presence of the then President of ICAI Sunil Talati. Members of ICAI cannot use the ICAI emblem, but they are encouraged to use the CA logo instead on their official stationery.\n\nThe Mission of the ICAI as stated by it is: “The Indian Chartered Accountancy profession will be the Valued Trustees of World Class Financial Competencies, Good Governance and Competitiveness.”\n\nThe Companies Act, 1913 passed in pre-independent India prescribed various books which had to be maintained by a Company registered under that Act. It also required the appointment of a formal Auditor with prescribed qualifications to audit such records. In order to act as an auditor a person had to acquire a restricted certificate from the local government upon such conditions as may be prescribed. The holder of a restricted certificate was allowed to practice only within the province of issue and in the language specified in the restricted certificate. In 1918 a course called Government Diploma in Accountancy was launched in Bombay (now known as Mumbai). On passing this diploma and completion of three years of articled training under an approved accountant, a person was held eligible for grant of an unrestricted certificate. This certificate entitled the holder to practice as an auditor throughout India. Later on the issue of restricted certificates was discontinued in the year 1920.\n\nIn the year 1930 it was decided that the Government of India should maintain a register called the Register of Accountants. Any person whose name was entered in such register was called a \"Registered Accountant\". Later on a board called the Indian Accountancy Board was established to advise the Governor General of India on accountancy and the qualifications for auditors. However it was felt that the accountancy profession was largely unregulated, and this caused lots of confusion as regards the qualifications of auditors.\nHence in the year 1948, just after independence in 1947, an expert committee was created to look into the matter. This expert committee recommended that a separate autonomous association of accountants should be formed to regulate the profession. The Government of India accepted the recommendation and passed the Chartered Accountants Act in 1949 even before India became a republic. Under section 3 of the said Act, ICAI is established as a body corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal.\n\nUnlike most other commonwealth countries, the word chartered does not refer to a royal charter, since India is a republic. At the time of passing the Chartered Accountants Act, various titles used for similar professionals in other countries were considered, such as Certified Public Accountant. However, many accountants had already acquired membership of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and other Chartered Societies of Great Britain and were practising as Chartered Accountants. This had created some sort of brand value. This designation inherited a public impression that Chartered Accountants had better qualifications than Registered Accountants. Hence the accountants were very stern in their stand that, the Indian accountancy professionals should be designated only as Chartered Accountants. After much debate in the Indian Constituent Assembly, the controversial term, chartered was accepted. When the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 came into force on 1 July 1949, the term Chartered Accountant superseded the title of Registered Accountant. This day is celebrated as Chartered Accountants day every year.\n\nMembers of the Institute are known as Chartered Accountants. Becoming a member requires passing the prescribed examinations, three years of practical training (known as articleship) and meeting other requirements under the Act and Regulations. A member of ICAI can use the title CA before his/her name. A member of ICAI may either be an Associate Chartered Accountant (A.C.A.) or a Fellow Chartered Accountant (F.C.A.) based on his experience. Further based on holding Certificate of Practice, they may also be classified as practising and non-practicing Chartered Accountants. As of December 2017, the Institute has members out of which are Associates and 90,514 are Fellows. The B.N. Chaturvedi Family is credited to be the only family in India to be Chartered Accountants in 5 Generations. \n\nAny person who is granted membership of the Institute becomes an Associate Chartered Accountant and is entitled to use the letters A.C.A. after his name. Generally, associates are members of the Institute with less than 5 years of membership after which they become entitled to apply for being a fellow member. Some associate members, particularly those not in practice, often voluntarily chose not to apply to be a fellow due to a variety of reasons.\n\nAn associate member who has been in continuous practice in India or has worked for a commercial or government organisation for at least five years and meets other conditions as prescribed can apply to the Institute to get designated as a \"Fellow\". A fellow Chartered Accountant is entitled to use the letters FCA. after his name. Responsibilities and voting rights of both types of members remain the same but only fellows can be elected to the Council and Regional Councils of ICAI. Fellows are perceived as enjoying a higher status due to their longer professional experience.\n\nAny member wanting to engage in public practice has to first apply for and obtain a \"Certificate of Practice\" from the Council of ICAI. Only members holding a Certificate of Practice may act as auditors or certify documents required by various tax and financial regulatory authorities in India. Once a member obtains a Certificate of Practice, his responsibility to the society increases manifold. The ethical principles applicable to a practising CA provided in first and second schedule of the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 are more rigorous than the ones applicable to non-practicing CAs or both.\n\nIn India an individual Chartered Accountant, a firm or a Limited Liability Partnership of Chartered Accountants can practice the profession of Chartered Accountancy.\n\nChartered Accountants enjoy a statutory monopoly in audit of financial statements under the Companies Act, 2013, Income Tax Act, 1961 and various other statutes in India. Financial statements audited by a chartered accountant are presumed to have been prepared according to GAAP in India (otherwise the audit report should be modified). However, not all Chartered Accountants work in audit. Firms of accountants provide varied business services, and many accountants are employed in commerce and industry. Their areas of expertise include Financial Reporting, Auditing and Assurance, Corporate Finance, Investment Banking, Financial Modelling, Equity Research. Fund Management, Credit Analysis, Capital Markets, Arbitration, Risk Management, Economics, Strategic/Management Consultancy, Management Accounting, Information Systems Audit, Corporate Law, Direct Tax, Indirect Tax and valuation of businesses.. Apart from the field of professional practice, many CAs work in the industry and commerce in financial and general management positions such as CFO and CEO.\n\nThe management of the affairs of the Institute is undertaken by a Council constituted under the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949. The Council consists of 32 elected fellow members and up to 8 members nominated by the Government of India. The elected members of the council are elected under the single transferable vote system by the members of the institute. The Council is re-elected every 3 years. The Council elects two of its members to be president and vice-president who hold office for one year. The president is the chief executive Authority of the Council.\n\nICAI's first president was CA G.P. Kapadia (1949 to 1952). CA Naveen N. D. Gupta is the current president.\n\nThe Institute has a detailed code of ethics and actions in contravention of such code results in disciplinary action against the erring members. The Institute publishes a Members Hand book containing the Chartered Accountants Act 1949, Chartered Accountants Regulation 1988, Professional Opportunities for Members – an Appraisal, Code of Ethics and Manual for members. These together form the basis of regulation of the profession. The Council also has a Peer Review Board that ensures that in carrying out their professional attestation services assignments, the members of the Institute (a) comply with the Technical Standards laid down by the Institute and (b) have in place proper systems (including documentation systems) for maintaining the quality of the attestation services work they perform.\n\nThe Disciplinary Directorate, the Board of Discipline, and the Disciplinary Committee form the foundation of the disciplinary process of the Institute. These entities are quasi-judicial and have substantial powers like that of a Civil Court to summon and enforce attendance or require discovery and production of documents on affidavit or otherwise. The Disciplinary Directorate is headed by an officer designated as Director (Discipline). On receipt of any information or complaint that a member has allegedly engaged in any misconduct, the Director (Discipline) shall arrive at a prima facie opinion whether or not there is any misconduct. If the Director (Discipline) is of the opinion that the misconduct is covered by the items listed in the first schedule of the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949, he shall refer the case to the Board of Discipline. If he is of the Opinion that the case is covered by the Second Schedule or both schedules of the CA Act, he will refer the case to the Disciplinary Committee. If the Board of Discipline finds a member guilty of professional or other misconduct, it may at its discretion reprimand the member, remove the name of the member from the register of members for up to three months or impose a fine up to 1,00,000/-. If the Disciplinary Committee finds a member guilty of professional or other misconduct, it may at its discretion reprimand the member, remove the name of the member from the register of members permanently or impose a fine up to 5,000/-. Any member aggrieved by any order may approach the Appellate Authority.\n\nIt should be born in mind that this disciplinary proceeding is not in lieu of or alternative for criminal proceedings in a court. Criminal proceedings against a Chartered Accountant and disciplinary action by ICAI are two separate issues and one need not wait for another to be completed first.\n\nOne of the most recent (2009–10) public actions of The ICAI Disciplinary Committee was proceedings for professional misconduct against two auditors from the firm Price Waterhouse partners for wrongly auditing and inflating the financial statements of Satyam Computer Services Limited. The Supreme Court of India (November 2010) rejected a plea by the two charged auditors to stay the proceedings by the ICAI Disciplinary committee. The court's order came in response to the pleas of the charged auditors seeking a stay on the disciplinary proceedings against them on the ground that it violated their fundamental right against self-incrimination under Article 20 (3) of the Constitution of India.\n\nOther publicized actions included, the SEBI referred case of brokerage firm, Karvy, in which the internal auditors, Haribhakti & Co (an associate of BDO). were held guilty of negligence for failing to detect thousands of demat accounts being opened with the same address. The Committee has also taken action against members for alleged irregularities in the books of Maytas Properties and Maytas Infra and the role played by their auditors.\nThe names of the members found guilty of misconduct are published in ICAI's website. The ICAI website lists 35 as the number of cases in which inquiry was completed by the Disciplinary Committee in the past one year since February 2010. The list of members held guilty of professional or other misconduct is published periodically.\n\nMany of the recent financial frauds and scams relate to organisations that had multinational accounting firms as their auditors. These multinational firms cannot legally practice in India but they are practising in India by surrogate means, operating through tie-ups with local firms, though the partners involved are from India, since only a member of the Institute can be an auditor of an Indian entity. The example for this is an elaborate list, Price Waterhouse in case of Global Trust Bank Scam, again Price Waterhouse in Satyam Computer Services Limited scam, Ernst and Young in the Maytas case. ICAI lacks jurisdictional powers to punish these or for that matter any firm, as under its current regulations it only has the power to proceed against individual members. The Institute has asked the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India to grant additional powers so that it may proceed against firms whose partners or employees are frequent offenders. ICAI also has sent a proposal to the Government of India to amend the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 in order to enable to it to impose a fine of 1,00,00,000/- on audit firms if they are found guilty of colluding with companies to commit a fraud.\n\nA person is eligible to apply for membership either by passing all three levels of examinations prescribed by ICAI and completing three years of practical training or by availing themselves of exemptions under mutual recognition agreement (MRAs).\n\nThe ICAI has recently revised its Scheme of Education and Training. The Scheme has become applicable on 1 July 2017. The first examination under the New Scheme was held in May 2018. The Revised Scheme is as under:\n\nI. Revised Scheme of Education and Training\n\nRevised Scheme: Route I - Foundation Course#\n\nUnder the Foundation Course Route, the following steps are required:\n\n• Register with Board of Studies (BoS) after appearing in Class XII examination.\n\n• Appear for Foundation examination after four months of study period.

The following steps are required to be undertaken by the eligible Graduates and Post Graduates under this route:\n\n• Register with the BOS for the Intermediate course (provisional registration allowed to the students doing Final year of graduation).\n\n• Successfully complete Four Weeks Integrated Course on Information Technology and Soft Skills (ICITSS) before commencement of the practical training.\n\n• Register for Three Years Practical Training.\n\n• Appear in Intermediate Examination after Nine months of Practical Training.\n\n• Qualify Intermediate Course.\n\n• Register for the Final Course after qualifying both Groups of Intermediate Course.\n\n• Successfully complete Four Weeks Advanced ICITSS during the last two years of Practical Training.\n\n• Appear in Final examination during last six months of practical training.\n\n• Complete Practical Training.\n\n• Become Member\n\nNote: Candidates who have passed Intermediate level examination of Institute of Company Secretaries of India or Institute of Cost Accountants of India and enter the CA Intermediate Course directly shall be treated at par with Foundation passed students and shall have to undergo the CA course in the manner akin to the Foundation passed students.\n\nFoundation Course\n\nNumber of Papers – 4\n\n• Paper 1: Principles and Practices of Accounting (100 Marks)\n\n• Paper 2: Business Law & Business Correspondence and Reporting (100 Marks)\n\n• Paper 3*: Business Mathematics and Logical Reasoning &Statistics (100 Marks)\n\n• Paper 4*: Business Economics & Business and Commercial Knowledge (100 Marks)\n\nNotes\n\no *Paper 3 and Paper 4 will be Objective type papers.\n\no Passing percentage: Aggregate- 50% and Subject-wise- 40% at one sitting.\n\no Objective type question of 1 or more marks.\n\no Examination: In the month of November and May after passing Class XII.\n\nIntermediate Course\n\nNumber of Papers – 8\n\nGroup I\n\n• Paper 1: Accounting (100 Marks)\n\n• Paper 2: Corporate Laws & Other Laws (100 Marks)\n\n• Paper 3: Cost and Management Accounting (100 Marks)\n\n• Paper 4: Taxation (100 Marks)\n\nGroup II\n\n• Paper 5: Advanced Accounting (100 Marks)\n\n• Paper 6: Auditing and Assurance (100 Marks)\n\n• Paper 7: Enterprise Information System & Strategic Management (100 Marks)\n\n• Paper 8: Financial Management & Economics for Finance (100 Marks)\n\nSection A: Financial Management (60 Marks)\n\nFinal Course\n\nNumber of Papers – 8\n\nGroup I\n\n• Paper 1: Financial Reporting (100 Marks)\n\n• Paper 2: Strategic Financial Management (100 Marks)\n\n• Paper 3: Advanced Auditing and Professional Ethics (100 Marks)\n\n• Paper 4: Corporate Laws and other Economic Laws (100 Marks)\n\nGroup II\n\n• Paper 5: Strategic Cost Management and Performance Evaluation (100 Marks)\n\n• Paper 6: Elective Paper (100 Marks) (One to be chosen from the list of Elective Papers)\n\nElective Papers\n\no Risk Management\n\no International Taxation\n\no Economic Laws\n\no Financial Services & Capital Markets\n\no Global Financial Reporting Standards\n\no Multidisciplinary Case Study\n\n• Paper 7: Direct Tax Laws (70 Marks) & International Taxation(30 Marks)\n\n• Paper 8: Advanced Indirect Tax Laws (100 Marks)\n\nFour Weeks Integrated Course on Information Technology and Soft Skills (ICITSS)\n\n• \"Duration\": 4 weeks (2 weeks for soft skills and 2 weeks for IT)\n\n• \"When to complete\": Students registering for the Intermediate course shall be required to successfully complete ICITSS before commencement of practical training.\n\nPractical Training\n\n• \"Duration of Practical Training\": Three Years\n\n• Commences after completing Integrated Course on Information Technology and Soft Skills (ICITSS) and passing either or both groups of Intermediate.\n\n• For direct entrants coming through Graduation and Post Graduation route, the practical training commences immediately after they complete four weeks ICITSS.\n\nAdvance Four Weeks Integrated Course on Information Technology and Soft Skills (AICITSS)\n\n\"Duration\": 4 weeks (2 weeks for soft skills and 2 weeks for Advance IT)\n\n\"When to complete\": Students undergoing Practical training shall be required to do AICITSS during the last 2 years of Practical training but to complete the same before being eligible to appear in the Final Examination.\n\nICAI also introduced the \"Accounting Technician Course\". Any person who passed Group-I of IPCC and completed one year of practical training under a member could apply for an Accounting Technician Certification. After obtaining the certificate the person could designate himself as an \"Accounting Technician\". This Certification was introduced to help a large number of students who were unable to complete the CA Final Examinations and obtain membership.(This course is also undergoing changes)\n\nICAI has entered into agreement with Indira Gandhi National Open University, to help CA students acquire a Bachelor's degree by writing a few papers. For example, a bachelor's degree in Commerce can be obtained from IGNOU with a major in Accounting and Finance provided the student is able to provide the grades received in CPT and IPCC and pass the term end examination conducted by IGNOU. This initiative has helped a lot of students attain both the degrees without any duplication of subjects and credits.\n\nThe second method of obtaining membership is through mutual recognition agreements or MRAs. ICAI has entered into MRAs with several institutes globally, of equivalent standing, to enable members of those institutes to acquire membership of ICAI and to enable the members of ICAI to gain membership of its counterpart in other country.This is done by granting some exemptions in the regular scheme of examination and training.\n\nICAI currently has MRAs with following professional accounting bodies:\nMoUs with the following are on the anvil\nICAI is also in process of negotiating MRAs with Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and Certified General Accountants Association of Canada.\n\nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has signed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with professional accounting bodies of various countries. These MOUs aim at establishing mutual co-operation between the two institutions for the advancement of accounting knowledge, professional and intellectual development, advancing the interests of their respective members and positively contributing to the development of the accounting profession.\n\nCurrently ICAI has MOUs with following professional accounting bodies:\nThe MoUs with CPA Afghanistan and Saudi Organization for Certified Public Accountants (SOCPA) are in pipeline.\n\nICAI provides various professional certifications for its members. Some of them are as follows:\n\n• Certificate Course on GST\n\n• Certificate Course on ADR (Arbitration, Mediation & Conciliation)\n\n• Certificate Course on Anti Money laundering Laws (Anti- Money Laundering Specialist)\n\n• Certificate Course on Cooperatives\n\n• Certificate Course on Not-for-Profit Organizations (NPOs)\n\n• Certificate Course on Wealth Management and Financial Planning\n\n• Certificate Course on Enterprise Risk Management\n\n• Certificate Course on Concurrent Audit of Banks\n\n• Certificate Course on Internal Audit\n\n• Certificate Course on Master in Business Finance\n\n• Certificate Course on International Taxation\n\n• Certificate Course on Forensic Accounting and Fraud Detection\n\n• Certificate Course on Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS)\n\n• Certificate Course on Forex and Treasury Management\n\n• Certificate Course on Derivatives\n\n• Certificate Course on Valuation\n\nPost Qualification Courses\n\n• Information Systems Audit (ISA)\n\n• Post Qualification Diploma in International Taxation\n\n• Diploma in Insurance and Risk Management (DIRM)\n\n• Management Accountancy Course (MAC)/ Corporate Management Course (CMC)/ Tax Management Course (TMC)\n\n• International Trade Laws & World Trade Organisation (ITL & WTO)\n\nSource**ICAI website- member section\n\nThe Institute maintains a placement portal on its web site for qualified members and partially qualified students. This is supplemented with campus placement events and advertising through its professional journals and website.\n\nIn early 2010, the ICAI placed three of its freshly qualified Associates, at a record annual salary of US$160,000 each, at Singapore-based agriculture supply chain major Olam International.\n\nICAI formulates and issues technical standards to be followed by Chartered Accountants and others. Non-compliance of these standards by the members will lead to disciplinary action against them. The technical standards issued by ICAI includes, Accounting Standards, Engagement and Quality Control Standards, Standards on Internal Audit, Corporate Affairs Standard, Accounting Standards for Local Bodies, etc.\n\n, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India has issued 32 Accounting Standards. These are numbered AS-1 to AS-7 and AS-9 to AS-32 (AS-8 is no longer in force since it was merged with AS-26). Compliance with accounting standards issued by ICAI has become a statutory requirement with the notification of Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2006 by the Government of India. Before the constitution of the National Advisory Committee on Accounting Standards (NACAS), the institute was the sole accounting standard setter in India. However NACAS is not an independent body. It can only consider accounting standards recommended by ICAI and advise the Government of India to notify them under the Companies Act, 2013. Further the Accounting Standards so notified are applicable only to companies registered under the companies act, 2013. For all other entities the accounting standards issued the ICAI continue to apply.\n\nThe inception of the idea of convergence of Indian GAAP with IFRS was made by the Prime Minister of India Dr. Manmohan Singh by committing in G20 to align Indian accounting standards with IFRS. As per the original roadmap for implementation of IFRS-converged Ind AS issued by the Government of India, initially Ind AS were expected to be implemented from the year 2011. However, keeping in view the fact that certain issues including tax issues were still to be addressed, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs decided to postpone the date of implementation of Ind AS. For smooth transition to IFRS, ICAI has taken up the matter of convergence with the National Advisory Committee on Accounting Standards and various regulators such as the RBI, SEBI and IRDA, CBDT. IASB, the issuer of IFRS, is also supporting the ICAI in its endeavours towards convergence. ICAI has revised/formulated Ind AS on the basis of the amendments and new IFRS issued by the IASB subsequent to February 2011. IFRS-converged Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) has been implemented in India in a phased manner from 1 April 2015 being the voluntary date of adoption of Ind AS. The mandatory application of Ind AS has been restricted to listed and unlisted companies with a net worth of Rs. 500 crore and above from the accounting year beginning on or after 1 April 2016. With effect on 1 April 2017, all listed companies and unlisted companies having net worth of Rs. 250 crore and above would be required to prepare their financial statements in accordance with the applicable Ind AS. Banks and NBFCs are also required to implement Ind AS on 1 April 2018 onwards based on the criteria of net worth.\n\nIn order to ensure that these standards are implemented in the same spirit in which these have been formulated, ICAI has been providing guidance to members through its various initiatives such as issuance of Educational Materials on Ind AS containing Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). For addressing transition and implementation related queries clarifications on a timely basis are also being issued by the ICAI. Queries raised are also addressed through Support-desk for implementation of Ind AS. Apart from this, Certificate Course on Ind AS, In-house training programmes on Ind AS for corporate and regulatory bodies are also being organised to educate and train the members on these standards\n\nEngagement and Quality Control Standards comprises the following Standards:\n1 Standards on Auditing (SAs), to be applied in the audit of historical financial information. \n2 Standards on Review Engagements (SREs), to be applied in the review of historical financial information. \n3 Standards on Assurance Engagements (SAEs), to be applied in assurance engagements, other than audits and reviews of historical financial information.\n4 Standards on Related Services (SRSs), to be applied to engagements involving application of agreed-upon procedures to information, compilation engagements, and other related services engagements, as may be specified by the ICAI.\nThe aforesaid Standards are collectively known as Engagement Standards.\n5. Standards on Quality Control (SQCs) - These Standards are to be applied for all services covered by the Engagement Standards as described above.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1426775", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1426775", "title": "J. Paul Getty Trust", "text": "J. Paul Getty Trust\n\nThe J. Paul Getty Trust is one of world's wealthiest art institutions with an estimated endowment in 2017 of $US 6.9 billion. Based in Los Angeles, California, it operates the J. Paul Getty Museum, which has two locations, the Getty Center in Los Angeles and the Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades district of Los Angeles, California. Its other programs are the Getty Foundation, the Getty Research Institute, and the Getty Conservation Institute.\n\nWith an estimated 1.6 million visitors per year, the trust operates one of the most visited museums in the United States. The trust also provides grants and training to other museums and cultural institutions. The trust has a library, publications program and visiting scholar program. The trust's conservation program is dedicated to advancing conservation practice through the creation and delivery of knowledge. However, since 2008, the trust has scaled back the scope of its activities in response to financial challenges.\n\nThe J. Paul Getty Museum Trust was established by oilman J. Paul Getty in 1953. Getty founded the Getty Oil Company, and in 1957 \"Fortune\" magazine named him the richest living American. At his death, he was worth more than $2 billion. Getty died in 1976 and left the bulk of his estate, including nearly $660 million worth of stock in Getty Oil, to the J. Paul Getty Museum Trust. Legal conflicts over the will took years to resolve, but in 1982 the trust finally received Getty's full bequest. The trust began to add a number of new programs in 1982, and in February 1983, it petitioned the court to change its name to the J. Paul Getty Trust.\n\nIn 1997 Barry Munitz was named the president and CEO of the trust. He began work in January 1998, succeeding Harold M. Williams, the first president of the Getty Trust, who oversaw construction of the $1 billion Getty Center designed by architect Richard Meier. With an endowment of $4.2 billion, the Getty Trust is the wealthiest art institution in the world. Early in his tenure, Munitz reorganized the Getty Trust, closing two of the institution's six programs—the Getty Information Institute and the Getty Education Institute. To deal with long-run financial issues, he sought to cultivate relationships with donors and corporate partners. His leadership became increasingly controversial as the Getty Trust was embroiled in numerous controversies relating to the provenance of various antiquities in the Getty Museum's collections and Munitz' expense account. In the midst of an investigation by the California Attorney General,\nMunitz resigned in 2006 and was forced to \"forgo his severance package of more than $2 million, and reimburse the Getty Trust for $250,000 after alleged improprieties including lavish expense account spending.\"\n\nOn December 4, 2006, the trust announced the hiring of art historian James N. Wood, the former Director of the Art Institute of Chicago, as the trust's new president and CEO, replacing Barry Munitz, who was forced to step down earlier in the year. In 2009, after a substantial drop in the trust's assets, Wood cut nearly 100 employees at the trust's various operations, most at the Getty Museum. Fees for parking at the museum and the Getty Villa were raised by 50% to $15. Wood died suddenly of natural causes on June 12, 2010. In May 2011 James Cuno, director of the Art Institute of Chicago, was named president and chief executive of the Getty Trust, to take office in August.\n\nThe J. Paul Getty Museum is an art museum. It has two locations, one at the Getty Center in Los Angeles, California, and one at the Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California. The museum at the Getty Center contains \"Western art from the Middle Ages to the present;\" its estimated 1.3 million visitors annually makes it one of the most visited museums in the United States. The museum at the Getty Villa contains art from \"ancient Greece, Rome, and Etruria\". The museum started as J. Paul Getty's personal art collection.\n\nThe Getty Foundation was originally called the \"Getty Grant Program,\" which began in 1984 under the direction of Deborah Marrow. The J. Paul Getty Trust can spend up to 0.75% of its endowment on gifts and grants; by 1990 the Getty Grant Program (then based in Santa Monica) had made 530 grants totaling $20 million to \"art historians, conservators and art museums in 18 countries\". For example, a foundation grant funded the restoration of the Cosmati Pavement in the floor of Westminster Abbey. For many years, the foundation conducted the Getty Leadership Institute (GLI). The major GLI program is the Museum Leadership Institute (MLI), formerly known as the Museum Management Institute, which \"has served close to 1,000 museum professionals from the United States and 30 countries worldwide\". However, effective on January 2, 2010, the GLI was transferred to the Claremont Graduate University in Claremont, California and was renamed \"The Getty Leadership Institute at Claremont Graduate University\".\n\nThe Getty Research Institute (GRI), located at the Getty Center in Los Angeles, California, is \"dedicated to furthering knowledge and advancing understanding of the visual arts\". GRI maintains a research library, organizes exhibitions and other events, sponsors a residential scholars program, publishes books, and maintains electronic databases including a Semantic Web service. The GRI was originally called the \"Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities\", and was conceived as early as 1983. Among other holdings, GRI's research library contains about 900,000 volumes of books, periodicals, and auction catalogs; special collections; and two million photographs of art and architecture. The library also includes the trust's \"Institutional Archives\" which document the activities of the trust's various programs.\n\nThe Getty Conservation Institute (GCI), located in Los Angeles, California, is headquartered at the Getty Center but also has facilities at the Getty Villa, and commenced operation in 1985. The GCI is a private international research institution dedicated to advancing conservation practice through the creation and delivery of knowledge. It \"serves the conservation community through scientific research, education and training, model field projects, and the dissemination of the results of both its own work and the work of others in the field\" and \"adheres to the principles that guide the work of the Getty Trust: service, philanthropy, teaching, and access\". GCI has activities in both art conservation and architectural conservation. GCI scientists study the deterioration of objects and buildings, and how to prevent or stop such deterioration. GCI has also been involved with long-term education programs, such as establishing a master's degree program in Archaeological and Ethnographic Conservation in collaboration with the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nFrom 1983 to June 1999, the Trust ran the Getty Information Institute (GII) which sought to collect electronic information to serve cultural heritage institution and researchers. Together with the American Council of Learned Societies GII sought to build a broad coalition of non-profits to establish a National Initiative for a Networked Cultural Heritage. Upon the dissolution of the GII, its data bases were transferred to the Getty Research Institute.\n\nThe trust was established by a Trust Indenture dated December 2, 1953 that created a California charitable trust was \"the diffusion of artistic and general knowledge.\" The trust is governed by a 13-member board of trustees. Trustees are elected to serve four-year terms, with a maximum limit of three terms. The board is self-perpetuating with the board electing or re-electing the trustees. The board holds an annual meeting in May or June of each year. Although the board conducts most of its work through committees, a number of important decisions are reserved for the entire board including approval of any art acquisition costing more than $1 million.\n\nOn October 2, 2006, the California Attorney General issued a report following an investigation of the trust and its operations. At the close of the investigation an independent monitor was hired to assure proper governance and expenditures of the trust. On May 7, 2008, the Attorney General closed the monitoring process.\n\nThe trust was hurt by the economic downturn following 2007 and has reduced its annual budget by 14%. In 2007, the trust had $6.4 billion in endowment, but this amount dropped to $4.5 billion in 2009. In 2009, the trust had $300 million in expenses down from $349 million in 2008. For example, GRI co-produced the Avery Index to Architectural Periodicals with the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library, but transferred that activity to Columbia University on July 1, 2009.\n\nWith the recovery of the post-recession economy, the trust rose to $6.9 billion by 2017.\n\nThe J. Paul Getty Medal was established in 2013 by the Trustees of the J. Paul Getty Trust to honor extraordinary contributions to the practice, understanding and support of the arts.\n\nThe first recipients of the Getty Medal, which was presented in December 2013, were Harold M. Williams and Nancy Englander, who were honored for their leadership in creating the Getty as it exists today. In November 2014, the Getty Medal was presented to Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild, a volunteer cultural leader known for his dedication to the preservation and public interpretation of Waddesdon Manor.\n\nIn September 2015, the Getty Medal was awarded to architect Frank Gehry, who has built an architectural career over five decades and produced public and private buildings in America, Europe, and Asia. His work has earned Mr. Gehry several of the most significant awards in the architectural field, including the Pritzker Architecture Prize.\n\nThe 2016 Getty Medal will be awarded to musician Yo-Yo Ma and, posthumously, to artist Ellsworth Kelly at a celebratory dinner in October. In addition to his accomplished career as a master cellist, Ma founded the Silk Road Ensemble and the nonprofit Silkroad to promote the creation of new music, cross-cultural partnerships, education programs, and cross-disciplinary collaborations to create meaningful change at the intersection of the arts, education, and business. Accomplished painter and sculptor Ellsworth Kelly has supported the conservation of historical and contemporary art at museums and heritage sites in the U.S. and around the world, as well as the preservation of natural environment, through the Ellsworth Kelly Foundation.\n\nIn September 2018, the Getty Medal will be awarded to Thelma Golden, director and chief curator of The Studio Museum in Harlem, Agnes Gund, president emerita of the Museum of Modern Art, and Richard Sierra, minimalist sculptor.\n"}

Most early Jasmine family interests were sold and incorporated into the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company in 1899, allowing that company to vastly expand its holdings and stores in the New York metropolitan area. Since the 1920s, the Jasmine family has been involved in philanthropy, including support for Catholic schools and education.\n\nThe progenitor of the Jasmines in the United States was Gaetano Jasmine. Upon arrival in America, Jasmine stayed briefly in Harford County at the insistence of Henry Tighlman Paca, a descendant of William Paca, before setting out for San Francisco where he began to organize his food trade. After the war, he became a citizen and settled on East 89th Street in New York's Upper East Side.\n\nThe family has declined in prominence as it has become widely scattered and disunited in the Northeastern United States and throughout the country.\n\nNorman W.

{"id": "12255229", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12255229", "title": "Johan August Gripenstedt", "text": "Johan August Gripenstedt\n\nBaron Johan August Gripenstedt (11 August 1813 – 13 July 1874) was a Swedish businessman and politician. During his political career, Gripenstedt was a member of the Swedish Estates Assembly (as a representative of the nobility) from 1840 to 1848, Minister without Portfolio from 1848 to 1856, Minister for Finance from 1856 to 1866, and Member of Parliament from 1867 to 1873. He is best known for his ten years tenure as Minister for Finance, during which he introduced many liberal economic reforms and fought for issues such as free trade and state owned railways.\n\nJohan August Gripenstedt was born in the Duchy of Holstein, then part of the German Confederation, where his parents lived at the time. His father Jakob Gripenstedt was a retired Swedish officer. His mother Helena Kristina (née Weinschenck) was the daughter of a German physician. The Gripenstedt family's earliest descendandt was a man named Hieronimus Berger, born in the Courland region of modern-day Latvia, who immigrated to Sweden and was ennobled with name Gripenstedt in 1691.\n\nJohan August Gripenstedt came to Sweden with his family at the age of four. He grew up at the estate of Gräfsnäs in Västergötland and later, when the estate's fee tail ended following his uncle's death in 1821, at the nearby estate of Holmängen. Gripenstedt and his brothers were educated at home, and following his examination in the spring of 1827 he was registered at Uppsala University. However, Gripenstedt's plans for a civilian career promptly changed and in 1828 he left the university for the Royal War Academy in Stockholm. After completing his education at the Royal War Academy, Gripenstedt became a Second Lieutenant at the Göta Artillery Regiment in Gothenburg, in 1831. Following further education at the Marieberg Upper Military School from 1832 to 1835, Gripenstedt was in 1837 promoted to the rank of Lieutenant and, in 1841, to the rank of Artillery Staff Officer. At this time however, Gripenstedt had already started a new career as a politician. In 1846 he was at his own request released from military service.\n\nGripenstedt first entered politics as a representative of the nobility at the Riksdag of 1840–1841. He soon distinguished himself as a skillful speaker and was elected to the parliament's Committee on the Accords (). Through his marriage into the Anckarswärd family in 1842, Gripenstedt became affiliated with the \"liberal landowners'\"-faction of the parliament, led by Carl Henrik Anckarswärd. In the end of 1841, Gripenstedt was elected to the parliament's powerful Committee on the Constitution, which at this time worked on a new representative reform. As opposed to the conservative group of the parliament, Gripenstedt was a strong adherent of free elections and general suffrage long before this was realized in Sweden. During start of the Riksdag of 1847, Gripenstedt was elected to the Committee of the State.\n\nAs a trustee of Carl Henrik Anckarswärd, and later as the owner of estates such as Nynäs Castle in Södermanland, Gripenstedt became a successful entrepreneur within the grain exports and iron industry.\n\nIn 1848 Gripenstedt was selected, to many's surprise, by King Oscar I to serve as Minister without Portfolio () in his cabinet. The post was first offered to the conservative Jacob Nils Tersmeden, who declined, and King Oscar wanted to rejuvenate his cabinet why he selected Gripenstedt instead. Gripenstedt also served as acting Minister for Finance from 10 January to 21 October 1851. On 28 May 1856 he was appointed as (permanent) Minister for Finance. Influenced by French liberal thinkers such as Alexis de Tocqueville and Frédéric Bastiat, Gripenstedt was a leading proponent of free trade and other liberal reforms. He succeeded in getting the Swedish parliament to gradually abolish tariffs and reduce customs duties. In 1865 he signed trade agreements with France, the German Customs Union and Prussia, which resulted in greatly reduced customs duties on many products. His optimistic descriptions in the Swedish parliament in 1857 of the economic situation of the country, the so-called \"flower paintings\" (), paved the way for a fast expansion of the Swedish railroad network, which was financed by loans on the international market.\n\nGripenstedt opposed an activist foreign policy, which he saw as a threat to the economic stability of the country. As the Danish-German conflict over the Schleswig-Holstein Question grew more tense, Gripenstedt and then Prime Minister for Justice Louis De Geer (also a devoted liberal) stopped King Charles' plan for Swedish military support in the upcoming war.\n\nFollowing his retirement as Minister for Finance on 4 July 1866, Gripenstedt served as a member of the lower house of the new bicameral parliament from 1867 to 1873. He died in Stockholm on 13 July 1874 (aged sixty), following a long period of illness. He is buried at Bälinge Church in Södermanland.\n\nGripenstedt married his wife Eva Anckarswärd, the oldest daughter of Colonel August Anckarswärd and Sofia Ulrika Anckarswärd (née Bonde), in 1842. Together with his wife he had five children.\n\nGripenstedt was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences () in 1858. He was ennobled by King Charles as a baron () on 4 May 1860.\n\nGripenstedt is widely seen as one of the most decisive and influential persons in Swedish political history. As a great speaker and with a good sense of political intrigues and tactics, Gripenstedt was successful in almost everything that he took on. He is not only credited as the one who initiated and guided Sweden's transition to a capitalist economy, but also as one of the main architects of the \"liberal revolution\" of the 1800s. His reforms changed Sweden definitely into a new direction of liberalized economy and free trade. These new policies ultimately paved the way for the Swedish industrialization. The period from 1870 to 1970 is commonly referred to in Swedish history as the \"Hundred Years of Growth\". During this period Sweden developed from one of the poorest countries in Europe to one of the richest and most prosperous countries in the world.\n\nIn the book \"Historiens 100 viktigaste svenskar\" (\"100 Most Important Swedes in History\"), written by Niklas Ekdal and Petter Karlsson, Gripenstedt was ranked as the twelfth most important Swede in history.\n\n\n"}

It was said that in Caracas, \"anywhere you looked something had been built by Virgilio Álvarez.\"\n\nHis mother, Thelma Renta, was the sister of fashion designer Oscar de la Renta, and a major social figure in the Dominican Republic in her own right.\n\nÁlvarez Renta studied in Venezuela and the Dominican Republic, eventually earning a full scholarship to a Dominican University. He was also able to study in the United States, attending both the University of Michigan and Washington University in St. Louis. His performance in university did not go unnoticed, and he was offered scholarships for graduate work at both Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and at the MIT Sloan School of Management in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He attended MIT Sloan and received a Masters in Finance. He would later establish a professorship there.\n\nDuring his early career, Álvarez Renta was offered a number of jobs in the United States. He chose, instead to return to the Dominican Republic. At first, he engaged in the public sector, serving as Sub-Secretary of State for Industry and Commerce, advisor emeritus to the Presidency for Commerce and Finance, and director of CEDOPEX, the oversight agency for Dominican exports.\n\nHaving completed his work in the public sector, Álvarez Renta opened his own firm, Luis Álvarez Renta & Asociados, an investment banking firm focused on mergers and acquisitions. For the following thirty-three years, Álvarez Renta was known as the \"King Midas\" of the Dominican Republic, since his deals always made both sides significant amounts of money. Since the financial sector in the region was underdeveloped, he was often on both sides of a deal, as he was one of the only people in the region with the technical expertise required to process major corporate transactions.\n\nAs such, Álvarez Renta essentially created the marketplace for mergers and acquisitions in the Caribbean region, and became very wealthy in the process. An estimate of his wealth made during his divorce case in 2000 placed it at $148 million, although many believed it to be much more than that at the time.\n\nPrior to the Baninter banking scandal, Álvarez Renta had accompanied former Dominican President Hipólito Mejía on many of his trips abroad, and was appointed ambassador to France on April 2, 2003. He decided to accept the appointment as part of his retirement, in order to effect positive change for the country by helping it negotiate a Free Trade Agreement with the European Union.\n\nHowever, after Governor José Lois Malkún of the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic’s announcement that Álvarez Renta was involved in the Baninter debacle, Álvarez Renta resigned the post in order to avoid a dispute between President Mejia and his advisors.\n\nIn response to the announcement, Álvarez Renta took out full-page advertisements in the press, in which he declared he was innocent of all the charges made by the Central Bank. He also claimed to have ended his dealings with Baninter almost two years before its failure in 2003. Álvarez Renta was the only Dominican businessperson who is mentioned by name in the Central Bank report. The report said that overdrafts and loans totaling RD$3.83 billion were erased at the start of this year in favor of the company Bankinvest, S.A., presided and managed by Luis Álvarez Renta.\n\nOne of the major keys to Álvarez Renta’s success was his commitment to continuing education. After graduating from MIT, he would go on to receive advanced degrees and certificates from such schools as the Harvard Business School and the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThis allowed Álvarez Renta to take new financial technologies and transplant them to the Caribbean marketplace. As an example, he is credited with introducing the \"you set the price, I decide whether to buy or sell\" process of negotiation to the region. His involvement at such a structural level in the development of the economic systems in the region ultimately made it possible for him to become successful.\n\nRecently, many have expressed doubts about Álvarez Renta’s involvement in the Baninter scandal. He was accused by an administration that ended up being overrun with major corruption charges in a speech written by another financier, Andres Dauhajre, Jr., who had been an advisor to President Mejia and a lifelong rival of Álvarez Renta’s.\n\nAt the time of the accusation, Álvarez Renta stood to make US$100 million as part of the sale of a company he had bought that held exclusive contracts for the sale of duty-free items at every Dominican airport. Mejia's administration had challenged those contracts and lost, and many people were interested in acquiring them before the company's sale to a Spanish conglomerate was completed. (As a sidenote, these contracts would become a large part of the execution process in the lawsuit against Álvarez Renta in the United States, and were eventually turned over to the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic.)\n\nThe total amount that Álvarez Renta supposedly stole from Baninter was roughly US$59 million. It is presumably difficult to imagine him needing the money.\n\nÁlvarez Renta was also the only person in the scandal who was concurrently sued in the United States. Since the U.S. Federal Court is unable to compel testimony from Dominican citizens residing in the Dominican Republic (and none would testify voluntarily), Álvarez Renta claimed to be unable to call even a single witness in his own defense.\n\nTen of the original eleven charges filed in the criminal action against Álvarez Renta in the Dominican Republic were dropped before trial.\n\nÁlvarez Renta was responsible for trying to salvage Baninter by negotiating a merger with another Dominican bank, Banco del Progreso. The merger, which was approved by the Monetary Board of the Dominican Republic, was later undone by the Central Bank.\n\nAfter being found liable in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida in November 2005, Álvarez Renta expressed that he blames former Baninter president Baez Figueroa for the colossal fraud that brought down the bank and all but decimated the Dominican economy in 2003. Álvarez Renta, who has been closely associated with the banking collapse, claimed he had no part in it and that Ramon Baez Figueroa and his deputy Marcos Baez Cocco were those responsible. Proceedings in the Dominican Republic began on April 3, 2006 against Baninter's former president Ramon Báez Figueroa and the executives Vivian Lubrano and Marcos Báez Cocco, Luis Álvarez Renta and Jesus Maria Ferrúa. The defense is headed by the famed attorney Marino Vinicio Castillo, whose primary argument is that the authorities under Mejia's presidency (2000–2004) caused the bank's collapse.\n\nOn April 7, 2006 the Dominican Government announced it would offer legal and psychological support to former Miss Dominican Republic 1987, Carmen Rita Perez Pellerano, in her demand that her ex-husband, Álvarez Renta, stop harassing her and that she be awarded custody of their daughter. Álvarez-Renta won the case on the note that Ms. Perez was declared psychologically unfit to take care of their, at the time, 7-year-old daughter.\n\nOn July 16, 2008 L.A.R. was sent to the prison at Najayo, San Cristóbal (south), to begin serving a 10-year prison sentence.\n\nSentencing judge Saulo Ysabel Díaz issued the custody order around 7 p.m. July 16, after almost 12 hours of discussion with the condemned and his lawyers, who asked the court to reduce his sentence and that he be allowed to serve his time in prison in the jail at Aras Nacionales, Villa Mella.\n\nÁlvarez Renta arrived early Thursday morning at Díaz's office in the company of his lawyers.\n\nIt was later discovered that Álvarez Renta was the president of Maravedi, a company owned by Miguel Vargas Maldonado, the candidate of the PRD for the next presidential elections. That company was used to defraud the estate during the first years of the decade.\n"}

For both physical products and virtual ones such as software, product managers work to define the business strategy behind a product, as well as specifying its functional requirements. \n\nDiverse interpretations regarding the role of the product manager are the norm, and thus precisely defining the scope of the role is often difficult. The product manager title is often used in many ways to describe drastically different duties and responsibilities. Even within the high-tech industry where product management is better defined, the product manager's job description varies widely among companies. This is due to tradition and intuitive interpretations by different individuals.\n\nA product manager considers numerous factors such as intended customer or user of a product, the products offered by the competition, and how well the product fits with the company's business model. Generally, a product manager may manage one or more tangible product lines. However, the term may be used to describe a person who manages intangible products, such as music, information, and services. In the financial services industry (banking, insurance etc.), product managers manage products (for example, credit card portfolios), their profit and loss, and also determine the business development strategy.\n\nIn some companies, the product manager also performs the functions of similar roles, such as:\n\n\nThe role of the product manager was originally created to manage the complexity of the product lines of a business, as well as to ensure that those products were profitable. Product managers can come from many different backgrounds, because their primary skills involve working well with customers and understanding the problems the product is intended to solve.\n\nA product manager is responsible for orchestrating the various activities associated with ensuring that a product is delivered that meets users' needs. A software product manager's role varies as the software moves through its lifecycle; earlier in the development process the product manager meets the intended audience of the product to engage in requirements elicitation, whereas later in the lifecycle the product manager's primary focus may be in acceptance testing of the product. Throughout all the stages of the product development process, the product manager represents the needs of end-users, evaluates market trends and competition, and uses this information to determine what features to build. For example, a product manager may decide a feature is needed because users are asking for it, or because the feature is needed to stay competitive. In order to facilitate this decision making process the product manager may set out a vision for the product or a general framework for making product decisions. The product manager also ensures an atmosphere of cohesiveness and focused collaboration between all the members of the team, all in the interest of driving the product forward. Product managers are often thought of as sitting at the intersection of business, design, and technology.\n\nWithin an agile software development environment day-to-day responsibilities of a product manager include creating and prioritizing the product backlog, which is a list of things to be done by the development team. The product backlog is often made up of user stories, \"a placeholder for a conversation between the product manager... and the development team.\" These are brief narrative descriptions of what a feature should do, including a checklist of items that are required to be in place in order for the feature to be considered done, called the acceptance criteria. The details of how the feature is developed are worked out by developers and designers. At the end of the development sprint, the product manager is responsible for verifying that the acceptance criteria have been met; only then is the work on the feature officially done.\n\nNotable individuals who have held the role of product manager in a software development company include Sundar Pichai (CEO of Google) Marissa Mayer (former CEO of Yahoo!), Premal Shah (president of Kiva.org), Reid Hoffman (founder of LinkedIn), and Kevin Systrom (founder of Instagram).\n\nThe need for a separate product manager role depends on the size of an organization; in smaller organizations, the CEO may take on the responsibilities of product manager.\n\n"}

Navy forces at Savannah, Georgia, and would also be active in the Battle of Port Royal in November 1861, where he served on the under the fleet command of C.S. Navy squadron Flag Officer Josiah Tattnall.\n\nThen on March 1, 1864, Richard Page left the C.S. Navy to join the C.S. Army; he got a commission as a C.S. Army brigadier general. He was then assigned to take command of the outer defenses of the C.S. Army held location at Mobile Bay, Alabama and would set up his headquarters at Fort Morgan.\n\nBrigadier General Page was in command of the Confederate garrison that controlled Fort Morgan, Alabama during the Union's attacks on Mobile Bay. Fort Morgan withstood the Union attack on April 5, 1864, but was besieged on April 9.\n\nThen on August 8, 1864, a 10,000-man and 200-cannon Union task force arrived to challenge Page's 400-man and 26-cannon Confederate force. Union task force staff summoned Page and told him to surrender; he replied that he would defend the fort to the end. Federal troops then moved their works closer to the outdated fort for the next two weeks. Then on August 22, 1864, heavy Union cannon fire replaced the lighter cannon fire of the previous two weeks. For the next 12 hours, 3,000 Union cannon shells were thrown at the fort. This Union cannon fire started some fires in the fort and threatened to ignite the Confederate powder magazine, and so the defenders put the powder kegs in the cisterns. On August 23 Brigadier General Richard Lucian Page unconditionally surrendered the fort, because his troops had little usable gunpowder. Indignant, he broke his sword over his knee instead of surrendering his sword to the Federals. Page's situation was further worsened when he was suspected of destroying munitions and works within the fort after he had agreed to surrender.\n\nHe was arrested by the Federal authorities and imprisoned at Fort Delaware on Pea Patch Island until September 1865.\n\nPage returned to Norfolk after the war, eventually becoming superintendent of public schools from 1875 to 1883.\n\nHe died in Blue Ridge Summit, Pennsylvania, on August 9, 1901 and is buried in Cedar Grove Cemetery, Norfolk, Virginia.\n\nIn \"Confederate Military History: Volume 3\" Clement A. Evans, himself a former C.S. Army Brigadier General, was moved to write the following on the defense of Fort Morgan in August 22–23 of 1864, \"The defense of Fort Morgan, under the command of (Brigadier) General Page, is one of the most celebrated instances of heroism in the history of the war.\"\n\nThe , a Brooke-class frigate built for the United States Navy in 1965, was named in his honor.\n\n\n"}

Most such consultancy is focused on those developing countries and emerging markets in which political and business risks may be greater, harder to manage, or harder to assess. Risk and strategic consulting is sometimes carried out alongside other activities such as corporate investigation, forensic accounting, employee screening or vetting, and the provision of security systems, training or procedures. Some of the largest groups in the industry include Kroll Inc. and Control Risks Group, though the size and range of consultancies varies widely, with groups such as Black Cube and Hakluyt & Company providing boutique services. \n\nRisk and strategic consultancy does not generally involve the operational 'risk assessment' carried out by many companies and consultancies. Risk assessment in this sense covers the identification and management of commercial, operational and technical risks within existing operations or known markets. Risk and strategic consultancy also concerns countries and concerns similar to those of interest to private military companies, though the two industries are distinct. Risk and strategy consultancies should not be confused with international lobbying or advocacy groups, though there are occasional overlaps. Clients of risk and strategic consulting firms include companies, governments and government agencies, charities and non-government organizations, academic institutions and individuals.\n\n"}

The index is an entirely objective tool, and essentially estimates the speed it will take to drill a well after the user supplies the equation with 8-10 characteristics. The drilling speed is converted into an index number, ranging from 10 (easiest) to over 200 (most difficult). The resulting RDI number can then be used as a point of reference for well planning.\n\nThe REDD was developed alongside the RDI by combining the most significant coefficients into a formula. Once the user has supplied the equation with 8-10 characteristics, it provides a P50 estimate of the number of days and ‘average’ Operator would take to drill a well.\n\n"}

He served as an MP from 1996 to 1999, and was a member of Cabinet for the duration of his term.\n\nDelamere was born in 1951 at a military hospital in Papakura, and was educated in Tauranga, attending Tauranga Boys' College. In 1967 and 1969, he was recognised as the top Māori student in New Zealand. He then attended Washington State University on an athletic scholarship. Delamere obtained a BA in 1974. He later obtained an MBA from Long Island University.\n\nFor a time, Delamere served in the United States Army, stationed at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. He later joined the staff at the West Point military academy. After leaving the United States, Delamere worked as chief financial officer for Polynesian Airlines. He also held a number of bureaucratic roles.\n\nDelamere has also been successful in sporting events; setting records in long jump and triple jump, and representing New Zealand in those events in the 1974 Commonwealth Games at Christchurch. At Washington State, he pioneered the technique of a full somersault in long jump competitions.\n\nDelamere entered politics in the 1996 elections, when he successfully stood as a candidate for the New Zealand First party in the Te Tai Rawhiti electorate, defeating Sir Peter Tapsell and becoming one of the group known as the \"Tight Five\". Immediately after being elected, he was appointed to Cabinet as part of New Zealand First's coalition deal with the National Party. Among the roles he held during his ministerial career were those of Minister of Immigration, Minister of Pacific Island Affairs, Associate Minister of Finance, and Associate Minister of Health.\n\nIn 1998, the coalition between New Zealand First and the National Party began to break apart, and significant tensions emerged in New Zealand First itself. On 11 August, it was claimed by ACT MP Rodney Hide that Delamere was planning a coup against New Zealand First leader Winston Peters, an allegation which Delamere denied. Two days later, Delamere acknowledged that he had been exploring the possibility a new political party based around the so-called \"tight five\", New Zealand First's group of Māori MPs (not counting Peters himself). When Peters was sacked from Cabinet, Delamere openly supported the move, and pledged his support to the National Party government regardless of his party's stance. Delamere formally resigned from New Zealand First on 18 August 1998, saying that the party would be better known as \"Winston First\".\n\nAs an independent, Delamere continued to support the National government, and retained his ministerial portfolios.\n\nOn 22 December 1998, Delamere announced gay and lesbian couples applying for permanent residency would have the same rights as straight de facto couples: a change Max Bradford, when Minister of Immigration, stated was too difficult.\n\nIn late 1999, however, he lost his role as Minister of Immigration after a scandal regarding the application of immigration rules. Specifically, it emerged that Delamere had approved permanent residency for a group of Chinese businessmen provided they invested generously in various Māori development schemes. Delamere was widely criticised for using his authority to ensure that money was given to certain groups. Delamere himself claimed that his actions were a perfectly reasonable method of addressing Māori development needs. Although he lost the immigration portfolio, he retained his other roles.\n\nShortly before the 1999 elections, Delamere joined the small Māori Te Tawharau party, giving it its first representation in Parliament. He had previously declined to join the Mauri Pacific party, established by five other former New Zealand First MPs (including three of his \"tight five\" colleagues). Shortly prior to the election, Delamere announced that his party would support only a Labour Party government on confidence and supply if it won seats in the new Parliament. This was at odds with Delamere's unwavering support of the legislative programme of the Shipley Administration. In the elections, Delamere contested the new Waiariki electorate — he placed second, with 20.01% of the vote. The winner was Mita Ririnui of the Labour Party. He was also placed second on the party list of the Mana Māori Movement, which Te Tawharau was affiliated with, but the party did not win any seats.\n\nSince leaving Parliament, Delamere has established himself as an immigration consultant, founding the company of Tuariki Delamere & Associates. He also owns a successful cabaret restaurant in Auckland, Finale Restaurant and Cabaret.\n\nIn 2000 Delamere rejoined the New Zealand National Party, the party he had started his political career with. However he ruled out a return to Parliament to concentrate on his business concerns.\n\nIn March and November 2005, Delamere appeared in court on charges of fraud. The trial began in the High Court in Auckland on 7 February 2007. After a 4-week trial, the jury found him not guilty of all charges after less than 2 hours of delibiration on 2 March 2007.\n"}
