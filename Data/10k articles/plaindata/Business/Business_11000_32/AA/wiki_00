It is advocated by those who consider the focus of the present standards and practices wholly inadequate to the task of measuring and reporting the activity, success, and failure of modern enterprise, including government.\n\nReal debate concerns concepts such as whether to report transactions, such as asset acquisitions, at their cost or at their current market values. The former, traditional approach, appeals for its reliability, but can quickly lose its relevance due to inflation and other factors; the latter, increasingly common approach, is appealing for its relevance, but is less reliable due to the need to use subjective measures. Accounting standards setters such as the International Accounting Standards Board attempt to strike a balance between relevance and reliability.\n\nLimited reforms within professional management circles have led in the past to activity-based costing, economic value added, and risk measures. Current accounting practices have also been criticised for being too complex.\n\nHeads of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission since the 1980s have consistently complained that this lobbying makes it impossible for them to apply meaningful reform, even in the wake of accounting scandals, e.g. that which felled Arthur Andersen in 2002.\n\nAny comprehensive scheme of accounting reform is a major professional and academic enterprise. Typically it requires examination of the role of each of the fundamental factors of production, an analysis of capital indicating how many types there are and how each supports each factor of a production process.\n\nA comprehensive scheme that would affect, for instance, the United Nations standards for national accounts, the rules of the Bank for International Settlements, or listing requirements on the major stock exchanges, would have to defend any change against critics that advocated lesser reforms.\n\nMarilyn Waring, who deeply criticized the UN account system for systematically under-valuing the social and economic contributions of women, stated also that she had to read literally an entire room full of books in order even to understand the standards applied today.\n\nThe critique from ecological economics claims that most means of measuring well-being indicated that the developed nations were in a state of \"uneconomic growth\" through the 1980s and 1990s, due mostly to failures of measurement, most or all of which could be tracked back to the practice of using Gross National Product or other narrow indicators as a means of making money supply (and other economic) decisions.\n\nRobert Costanza, Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins and others who advocate a consistent global system for valuing natural capital, note that failures in this area are particularly grim: promoting extinction, loss of biodiversity, climate change and destructive weather for the sake of such \"growth\". John McMurtry characterized this as \"the cancer stage of capitalism\".\nWhat makes \"economic sense\" under current standards, they argue, is in fact leading to ecological catastrophe, social conflict, and economic chaos.\n\nNotable advocates of accounting reform:\n\n"}

There are many different definitions of the AAR. However, in one form or another, the AAR is always defined as: Some measure of average accounting profit divided by some measure of average accounting value. The specific definition we will use is: Average net income divided by Average book value. It is kinds of decision rule to accept or reject the finance project. For decide to these projects value, it needs cutoff rate. This rate is kind of deadline whether this project produces net income or net loss. \nThere are three steps to calculating the AAR.\n\nFirst, determine the average net income of each year of the project's life. Second, determine the average investment, taking depreciation into account. Third, determine the AAR by dividing the average net income by the average investment. After determine the AAR, compare with target cutoff rate. For example, if AAR determined is 20%, and given cutoff rate is 25%, then this project should be rejected. Because AAR is lower than cutoff rate so this project will not make sufficient net income to cover initial cost. Average accounting return(AAR) does have advantages and disadvantages. Advantages; It is easy to calculate than other capital budgeting decision rules. It only needs net income data and book values of the investment during its life. Another advantage is needed information will usually be available. Disadvantage; it does not take time value of money into account. When we average figures that occur at different times, we are treating the near future and the more distant future in the same way. Therefore, there is no clear indication of profitability. And also should use an arbitrary benchmark cutoff rate is kind of disadvantage thing. The last disadvantage is it is based on accounting net income and book values, not cash flows and market values.\n"}

Screenwriter Ben Younger interviewed for a job at brokerage firm Sterling Foster. Younger said, \"I walked in and immediately realized, 'This is my movie.' I mean, you see these kids and know something is going on.\"\n\nIn 1999, Seth Davis (Ribisi), a 19-year-old Queens College dropout, runs an unlicensed casino in his home near the campus, catering to college students. Although he earns a successful living, he is a disappointment to his father, Marty (Rifkin), a New York City federal judge. One night, his cousin Adam (Kennedy) stops by the casino to play blackjack, bringing a rich associate named Greg Weinstein (Katt) along with him. Greg recruits Seth to join J.T. Marlin, a brokerage firm based somewhere off the Long Island Expressway, promising him that he has the opportunity to get rich.\n\nArriving at J.T. Marlin, Seth attends a group interview and learns from Jim Young (Affleck), one of the co-founders of the firm, what is expected of his work and also how he can become a millionaire. The firm's techniques of selling are through cold calling investors to sell stock, and Seth joins as a stockbroker trainee, having to close 40 accounts and pass a Series 7 Exam to begin working independently. The brokers love to quote insider trader Gordon Gekko from \"Wall Street\", seeing him as a role model. He is soon making a good living, as well as winning his father's approval and embarking on a romance with Abbie Halpert (Long), a secretary and Greg's ex-girlfriend.\n\nEventually, he learns that J.T. Marlin is a chop stock brokerage firm that runs a \"pump and dump\", using its brokers to create artificial demand in the stock of expired or fake companies, and speculative penny stocks. When the firm is done pumping the stock, the investors then have no one to sell their shares to in the market, and the price of the stock plummets. The FBI agents investigating the firm decide to pursue Seth, hoping to make him their informant.\n\nSeth passes his Series 7 Exam and becomes a broker. He then contacts Harry Reynard (Taylor Nichols), the purchasing manager of a gourmet foods company. Although Harry is reluctant, he gives in after Seth lies that the stock is guaranteed to go up in value; Seth sells him 100 shares at $8 each. When the stock's value drops, Harry calls back to ask why the stock has done so poorly, only to have Seth persuade him to buy more worthless shares. The stock eventually tanks, costing Harry his savings and his family.\n\nFeeling guilty for scamming Harry, Seth resolves to shut the firm down. Marty then disowns him, accusing him of destroying peoples' lives. Seth shows up at his father's office and tearfully explains that he shut down his casino and went along with a highly criminal line of work that he thought was legal to gain his family's approval. He then requests that his father help him on an IPO scheme to rob the firm of their money and bring them down. Although Marty initially refuses due to the risk of losing his judgeship, he calls Seth the next day, reconciling with him and offering to help with the scheme.\n\nSeth is eventually arrested by the FBI for the violation of 26 SEC and NASD regulations, and is brought into their custody along with his father, as the bureau had discovered their IPO scheme from a tape-recorded phone conversation. The FBI offer him federal immunity if he agrees to testify against J.T. Marlin once all the suspects are brought into court, and threaten to involve Marty in order to assure Seth's cooperation. Seth asserts that he will testify against the firm and provide strong evidence of their illegal practices only if his father is released. He and the agents come to an agreement on this, with Seth being kept overnight. After that, it is implied that he will be free to go as the FBI will proceed to raid the building and prosecute everybody else.\n\nSeth returns to work the next day and goes along with the FBI's instructions to make copies of investment files onto a floppy disk to use as evidence. Before leaving, Seth attempts to get Harry's money back. He lies to Michael Brantley (Scott), the company's founder, by explaining that the firm can lose a lot of money by refusing to continue to do business with Harry Reynard, who Seth makes out to be an important prospect at a make-or-break point. Brantley agrees to proceed, offering him shares of the next IPO, with a caveat that he cannot sell the shares until the firm has sold off theirs. In order to sell the shares behind Michael's back, Seth needs a ticket sale signed by a senior broker, something that his direct supervisor, Greg, has explicitly said that he would never do. He seeks a signing from Chris Varick (Diesel), explaining that he may as well \"do one thing right\" in helping a severely hit investor make his money back, now that the firm will be raided and, soon enough, there will be no future in continuing business at J.T. Marlin. Chris reluctantly agrees, and proceeds to escape the building in an attempt to flee federal enforcement. Seth walks out to his car, deciding what to do with his life now that his ties with J.T. Marlin are finished. As he departs in his car, several FBI cars, buses, and tow trucks enter the parking lot, with agents storming out ready to raid the building.\n\n\nThe film opened in the United States on February 18, 2000, alongside \"Hanging Up\", \"Pitch Black\" and \"The Whole Nine Yards\", grossing $6.7 million on its opening weekend. Eventually, the film grossed $17 million domestically and $11.8 million in other territories, with a worldwide total of $28.8 million.\n\n\"Boiler Room\" received generally positive reviews. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 67% based on reviews from 99 critics; the site's consensus is: \"Its ending is disappointingly tidy, but \"Boiler Room\" boasts just enough sharp writing and brisk pacing to make getting there worthwhile.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28411273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28411273", "title": "British Parking Association", "text": "British Parking Association\n\nThe British Parking Association (BPA), is a British-based trade association that represents the views and interests of its membership drawn principally from the parking and traffic management fields. More fully described as the British Parking Association Limited the association is a company limited by guarantee and non-profit organisation founded in 1968, although the limited company was not registered until 1970.\n\nThe BPA's stated aim is to actively represent and promote the sector by advancing knowledge, raising standards and professionalism, and using its influence to deliver excellence for the benefit of all, although the BPA is fully funded by its members rather than any independent source. The association's headquarters are in Haywards Heath, West Sussex and it produces the monthly magazine \"Parking News\".\n\nAlthough the association does not publish its membership lists, it asserts that there are currently about 720 members which includes manufacturers and suppliers, private car park operators, local authorities, health authorities, airports, the privately owned railway operating companies, shopping centres, bailiffs, debt collectors and consultants. Members, whether from the private or public sectors, pay a subscription based on their parking revenues. There are five levels of individual membership each of which pay a fixed rate fee.\n\nThe association manages the \"Safer Parking Scheme\" (formerly the Secured Car Parks Award) on behalf of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO). The purpose of the scheme is to raise the standard of safety, security, design and operation of UK car parks. \nCar parks that are found to meet the criteria set down by the scheme are awarded the Park Mark Safer Parking Award. The award is made after inspection by an accredited assessor and is subject to re-assessment every 2 years.\nPark Mark is considered a prestigious award and may be granted to council or privately operated car parks. In 2014 the Scheme celebrated its 10th Anniversary since becoming the Safer Parking Scheme.\n\nThe Association set up the Approved Operator Scheme (AOS) in 2007 in response to concerns about the management of car parking on private land, an area of the parking profession in the United Kingdom which was at that time unlegislated. Members of the scheme are required to comply with the BPA's Code of Practice (CoP).\n\nIn August 2010, the Coalition Government announced their intention to ban clamping on private land. The next two years saw the development and subsequent Royal Assent of the Protection of Freedoms Act<ref name=\"enacted 2012/9\">http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/9/contents/enacted</ref> which bans all forms of immobilisation without lawful authority.\n\nThe BPA welcomed the change as a move to marginalise rogue clampers, but felt that the legislation took away a valuable form of enforcement for landowners to use in the protection of their land. In order to ensure that private enforcement remained with a robust solution, the BPA's discussions with Government resulted in a form of keeper liability being introduced with the Protection of Freedoms Act, allowing the private operator in England and Wales to pursue the registered keeper of a vehicle if a named driver cannot be traced or denies liability.\n\nPrivate parking companies are permitted to issue notices as specified in the Protection of Freedoms Act Schedule 4. They do not have the legal authority to issue fines or penalties, except in rare cases such as train or railway station car parks.\n\nOnly tickets issued by the police or Council are legally enforceable (except as previously stated, certain railway or train station car parks also have legal authority to issue penalties).\n\nKeeper liability has been introduced by Government on the proviso that the parking profession provides the motorist with an Independent Appeals Service (IAS), and that the service will be funded by the industry. POPLA - Parking on Private Land Appeals - launched on 1 October in England & Wales only, Northern Ireland and Scotland does not have keeper liability or Popla.\n\nAlongside the launch of the AOS in 2007, DVLA announced that any company/organisation accessing Vehicle Keeper data via an electronic request process that is not a Local Authority or Government Organisation must be a member of an Accredited Trade Association (ATA).\n\nA condition of an ATA is that they have a Code of Practice in place. The BPA has been working with DVLA since their announcement, achieving ATA status and sharing all plans for the AOS with DVLA.\n\nIn complying with the Code, operators that are members of the AOS are able to demonstrate that their business operates to a set of standards and that it is recognised as an ostensibly professional and responsible member of the industry. However, if non-compliance to the Code is proven, it leads to sanctions being temporarily applied and could ultimately result in the member being suspended or expelled from the scheme.\n\nThere are principles in contract law when applied to private parking, that the driver of a vehicle is invited by the parking operator (and/or the landowner) to park in a car parking site, and that the terms and conditions of the parking contract should be set out clearly and concisely through the placement of signs as you enter and around the site. These are clearly specified in the BPA's Code of Practice for Parking on Private Land.\n\nOperators do not have legal power to issue fines or penalties as a result of people parking on private land, as this is classed as misrepresentation of authority. They are able to issue a Parking Charge Notice (PCN) as specified in Schedule 4 of the Protection of Freedoms Act.\n\nIn parking at the site, a driver may have accepted those terms and conditions, provided they are clearly displayed, and the driver has read and understood them as set out in the case of \"Vine v London Borough of Waltham Forest\" [2000] EWCA Civ 106.\n\nIn his judgment, Lord Justice Roche stated:\nWheel clamping on private land was banned as of 1 October 2012 when the Protection of Freedoms Bill was passed into law.\n\nAdvice and guidance for motorists parking on private land can be found on various websites including the BPA, Know Your Parking Rights and POPLA. Website forums such as Pepipoo and moneysavingexpert also debate the issues.\n\nOn 10 July 2012, Martin Cutts of the Plain Language Commission made a speech at an event delivered by Landor Publishing \"The Enforcement Summit '12\" which was attended by some BPA executive members.\n\nIn a speech made at Europe's largest parking event Parkex on 10 June 2014, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport Robert Goodwill praised the private parking sector by saying that industry self-regulation can succeed and that the establishment of POPLA, providing motorists with independent and free appeals is testament to the high standards that are often promoted by parking professionals, who are providing well designed, fair and proportionate parking services.\n\nThis is the name of the independent appeals service established by the BPA and initially operated by London Councils from October 2012 to September 2015 – Ombudsman Services took over as the service provider for POPLA on 1 October 2015. The remit of POPLA to handle appeals by drivers and others wanting to challenge the issue of a parking charge notice issued by members of the BPA's Approved Operator Scheme on private land in England and Wales. POPLA only handles appeals after the recipient of the parking charge notice has been through the internal complaints procedures of the operator who issued the notice.\n\nIts adoption across England & Wales makes it available to all motorists, who park on private land where parking is invited including, retail parks, railway stations etc. as well as locations where parking is not invited. POPLA is not currently available In Scotland or Ireland.\n\nPOPLA is judicially independent when it comes to deciding the outcome of an appeal and their decision is binding on the operator only. The POPLA service is free to the motorist with the parking operator being charged a fee for every appeal that is considered.\n\nAt the official launch of POPLA, then Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport Norman Baker welcomed the Report and the success of POPLA stating \"This report shows that motorists are using this new free appeals service in significant numbers and, in more than half of cases, having their appeals upheld. This shows the new system is working for drivers and for the parking industry.\"\n\nMedia interest in the association has changed over time. Although members of the BPA have previously had their actions featured on the BBC Consumer Affairs Programme \"Watchdog\", media interest on the private parking profession has decreased since the introduction of the BPA's Approved Operator Scheme and launch of POPLA. \nThe BPA regularly contribute to TV and radio broadcasts when private parking is debated. Consumer help websites including MoneySavingExpert.com forums, Pepipoo, Consumer Action Group also provide their own opinion on the profession.\n\nOn 30 August 2012 Combined Parking Solutions (CPS) was suspended from accessing the DVLA database for three months.\nThe suspension was put in place as a result of CPS breaking the DVLA's rules on signage for privately issued parking tickets. The rules state(s) that parking companies must not make reference to liability by anyone other than the driver. On 14 June this year, the DVLA sent a memo to the BPA about this issue and instructed them to put out a warning to their members, download here. However, CPS was subsequently found to be in breach of this instruction on at least three separate occasions, and this resulted in their suspension.Being suspended from accessing the DVLA's registered keeper database will have a major effect upon how CPS operates. Private parking companies use this database to find out who the registered keeper is of vehicles they wish to issue a ticket to so that they can send out demands for payment. Without this data, they have no way of trying to chase payment where the driver has not identified themselves (e.g. via an appeal). Further to this, the DVLA has confirmed that CPS will not be able to retrospectively gather this data after the suspension ends or via another parking company. Furthermore, shortly before CPS was suspended, the British Parking Association had only just recently appointed a Combined Parking Solutions representative to the Board of its Approved Operator Scheme. They continue to be represented on the AOS Board and no further issues have since been reported. Combined Parking Solutions ceased to be a member of the BPA in November 2014. As part of the BPA's new Governance, the AOS Board ceased to exist in 2014. Approved Operator Scheme members are now represented on the BPA's Council of Representatives.\n\n"}

{"id": "14900040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14900040", "title": "Chinese Industrial Cooperatives", "text": "Chinese Industrial Cooperatives\n\nChinese Industrial Cooperatives () (CICs) were organisations established by a movement, involving various Western expatriates, to promote grassroots industrial and economic development in China. The movement was led through the Chinese Industrial Cooperative Association (CICA or Indusco) founded in 1938. Its international arm the International Committee for the Promotion of Chinese Industrial Cooperatives (ICCIC, also known by the nickname Gung Ho International Committee) was founded in 1939 in Hong Kong to promote cooperatives in China.\n\nThe movement was especially active in the 1930s and 1940s with bipartisan support from both the left and right wings of Chinese politics. The movement disappeared after the 1950s due to suppression by the People's Republic of China government, but CICA and ICCIC were revived in the 1980s and are still active today. In the English-speaking world, the industrial cooperatives’ best known legacy is its nickname Gung Ho meaning \"working together\", which led to the word ‘gung-ho’.\n\nThe Gung Ho (工合 \"Gōnghé\", literally \"work together\") movement was first initiated in Shanghai in 1937. Some of the principal organizers were Rewi Alley of New Zealand, Edgar Snow, Nym Wales (Helen Foster Snow), and Ida Pruitt of the USA, as well as a group of Chinese including Hu Yuzhi () and Sha Qianli (). In August 1938, the CICA was established. It was founded in the wartime capital Hankow when China was engaged in the War of Resistance Against Japan. Through the sponsorship of Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Finance Minister Dr. H. H. Kung supplied government financial support.\n\nThe movement aimed to organize unemployed workers and refugees, increasing production to support the war effort. The goal was to replace industrial capacity lost to bombing by dispersing and giving workers voting shares in their CICs. The CICA organized small scale self-supporting cooperatives, mainly in rural areas, to create employment for workers and refugees and produce goods for the war effort.\n\nIn January 1939, the international arm ICCIC was established in Hong Kong. Ms. Soong Ching-ling was elected honorary chair and the Anglican Bishop of Hong Kong, the Right Rev. Ronald O. Hall to be chair, and Dr. Chen Hansheng was appointed as secretary general.\n\nIn 1941, the Gung Ho movement reached its peak: around 3 000 cooperatives with a combined membership of nearly 300 000 people were functioning. Their factories produced more than 500 products for the local people, and a large number of blankets, uniforms and other army supplies for the battlefront. Ida Pruitt toured the United States to raise substantial financial support. The unique role of Gung Ho cooperatives in the war also won such international acclaim that the term \"gung-ho\" became a famous slogan of the U.S. Marine Corps, and entered the English language as a term denoting whole-hearted dedication to a meaningful cause.\n\nBoth the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek and the Communist movement of Mao Zedong supported the movement and tried to control it. Alley placated the Nationalists but his sympathies and eventual loyalties were to the emerging Communist government. In 1942, Alley was dismissed from Gung Ho by the government of Chiang Kai-shek. After Mao’s victory in 1949 Alley stayed in China, but there was no need for the CICA and ICCIC. Both CICA and ICCIC suspended their works in 1952.\n\nAn excellent discussion of the CICs appears in Graham Peck's book \"Two Kinds of Time\" (1950). Peck traveled with Alley to a number of CICs early in 1941 and was able to see them at their height, but as his experience grew he came to understand their limitations and the fact that their course was ultimately downwards, not upwards, for a variety of reasons.\n\nThe CICA was revived in 1983, and the ICCIC was revived in 1987 in Beijing by Alley and other former Gung Ho leaders. The reorganized ICCIC registered with the Ministry of Civil Affairs of People's Republic of China as an international non-profit organization. Zhu Xuefan () was elected as honorary chair and Alley as chair.\n\nThe main task of the revived ICCIC is the promotion of cooperatives in China. Membership is open to all individuals and organizations who support the cooperative movement. The committee has approximately 100 members from China, Australia, Germany, Belgium, France, Japan, Mexico, Singapore, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and Hong Kong. The ICCIC’s General Assembly of all members meets every five years. The Executive Board elected by the Assembly is responsible for decision-making on major issues according to its articles of association during the adjournment of the Assembly. A secretariat is set up to handle day-to-day work.\n\n\n\n"}

Aspects of communications management include developing corporate communication strategies, designing internal and external communications directives, and managing the flow of information, including online communication.\n\nIn project management, communication management must address the following questions:\n\nOne simple and popular communications method is called the weekly reporting method: every employee composes an e-mail report, once a week, including information on their activities in the preceding week, their plans for the following week, and any other information deemed relevant to the larger group, bearing in mind length considerations. Reports are sent to managers, who summarize and report to their own managers, eventually leading to an overall summary led by the CEO, which is then sent to the board of directors. The CEO then sends the board's summary back down the ladder, where each manager can append an additional summary or note before referring it to their employees.\n\nEventually, each employee will receive a long e-mail, containing many or all of the above-mentioned summaries, from every level of management; reading the full result is rarely a requirement. Curious or ambitious employees are considered more likely to read the result; task-centered employees, however, are not.\n\n"}

Organizations are individually different, face different situations (contingency variables), and require different ways of managing. Contingency approaches remain less common than change management approaches.\n\nContingency approach evolved during the 1960s. Management theory and research began to adopt a new orientation, one that embodied a simple concept and enabled significant advancements in the study of management and organizations, now referred to as the contingency approach. It emphasized the importance of situational influences on the management of organizations and questioned the existence of a single, best way to manage or organize. Today, the contingency approach dominates theory and research in the management literature. Contingency approach challenged the classic process and models designed by management theorists such as Frederick Winslow Taylor (Scientific management) and Henri Fayol (Fayolism). Various researchers concentrated on different contextual factors. Joan Woodward (1958) studied the production technology, Blau and Schoenherr (1971) the size of the organizations, Burns and Stalker (1961) as well as Lawrence and Lorsch (1967) into the economic environment, in particular market competition and technological change. A broader approach was developed by a British team of researchers at the University of Aston, widely known as Aston Group by developing a conceptual scheme for the comparative analysis of organizational structure which took account of several contextual factors at the same time (Pugh, Hickson, et al., 1963).\n\nA conceptual model of the contingency approach was developed by Kieser and Kubicek. According to the model, the formal structure of an organization defines the roles of its members in a specific way and thereby directs their behavior to a certain degree. The performance of the organization depends on the degree to which these role definitions enable members to cope with the requirements resulting from the context of the organization.\n\n\n"}

Koshland Jr.\n\nDaniel Edward Koshland Jr. (March 30, 1920July 23, 2007) was an American biochemist. He reorganized the study of biology at the University of California, Berkeley, and was the editor of the leading US science journal, \"Science\", from 1985 to 1995. He was a Member of the United States National Academy of Sciences.\n\nKoshland was born to a Jewish family, the son of Daniel E. Koshland Sr. and Eleanor Haas, daughter of the Haas family patriarch Abraham Haas. His great-grandfather was wool merchant Simon Koshland. He has two siblings: Frances \"Sissy\" Koshland Geballe and Phyllis Koshland Friedman. His father served as CEO of Levi Strauss & Co. from 1955 to 1958 and is widely credited with saving the company during the Great Depression.\n\nKoshland's private fortune, derived from Levi Strauss, put him on lists of America's wealthiest people. Rather than relying on his fortune, Koshland chose to pursue a career in science. Koshland wrote in an autobiographical article that he decided to become a scientist in the eighth grade after reading two popular books about science, \"Microbe Hunters\" by Paul de Kruif and \"Arrowsmith\" by Sinclair Lewis.\n\nAttending Phillips Exeter Academy for high school Koshland then became the third generation of his family to matriculate to the University of California at Berkeley (UCB) where he majored in chemistry.\nThe next five years, 1941–46, were spent working with Glenn T. Seaborg at the University of Chicago on the top-secret Manhattan project, where his team purified the plutonium that was used to make the atomic bomb at Los Alamos.\n\nIn 1949, he received his Ph.D. in organic chemistry from the University of Chicago. His early work was in enzyme kinetics at Brookhaven National Laboratory, Long Island, and Rockefeller University, New York. This led him to propose the induced fit model for enzyme catalysis. After this advance, he turned to studying how bacteria control their movements in chemotaxis.\nDr. Koshland's laboratory made three major discoveries concerning protein phosphorylation in bacteria. (1) The first phosphorylated bacterial protein, isocitrate dehydrogenase, was identified. (2) It was demonstrated that substituting an aspartate residue for the serine residue that was phosphorylated causes the protein to behave as if it were phosphorylated. (3) The response regulators in the two-component regulatory systems were shown to be phosphorylated on an aspartate residue and to be protein phosphatases with a covalent intermediate.\n\nHe spearheaded the reorganization of the biological sciences at Berkeley, merging 11 departments into three. In 1992, Koshland Hall was named after him. The building is located next to (and on some floors connected to) Barker Hall. Koshland Hall houses a number of laboratories in both Molecular and Cell Biology as well as Plant and Microbial Biology.\n\nKoshland served as editor of the journal \"Science\" from 1985 to 1995. His philosophical essay \"The Seven Pillars of Life\" is frequently cited and discussed in terms of extraterrestrial and artificial life as well as biological life.\n\nIn 1998, Koshland was awarded the Albert Lasker Special Achievement Award given by the Lasker Foundation for medical research in the United States. In 2008, the award was renamed the Lasker-Koshland Special Achievement Award in Medical Science in honor of Koshland.\n\nHe was married to Marian Koshland (), a fellow UC Berkeley professor, from 1946 until her death in 1997. Marian was a gentile, the daughter of a teacher who had immigrated from Denmark and a hardware salesman father of Southern Baptist background. Daniel and Marian had five children: Ellen Koshland, Phyllis \"Phylp\" Koshland, James Koshland, Gail Koshland, and Douglas Koshland. Koshland's son Douglas Koshland is a professor of genetics at UC Berkeley. Daniel Koshland supported the creation of the Marian Koshland Science Museum by giving a major gift to the National Academy of Sciences in Marian's honor.\n\nAfter his wife's death in 1997 he reconnected with onetime classmate Yvonne Cyr San Jule and they were married in on August 17, 2000. San Jule had four children from previous marriages: Christopher Keene, Philip, Elodie Keene, and Tamsen Calhoon ().\n\n"}

He served as the Minister without Portfolio in charge of the National Investment Plan in the 2007-2008 Cabinet of Serbia and prior to that as the director of the People's Office of the President between 2004 and 2007.\n\nOn 18 April 2011 Đilas became the President of Basketball Federation of Serbia (KSS). He resigned in November 2016.\n\nĐilas graduated from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Mechanical Engineering in the aerospace engineering program.\n\nHe worked as journalist at Radio Index. On 15 May 1989, part of Radio Index merged with \"Ritam Srca\" radio programme thus forming Radio B92, meaning that Đilas was one of the new station's founders. He soon became a news editor at the station.\n\nSimultaneously, Đilas was active in opposing the rule of Slobodan Milošević, leading the student protests in 1991 and 1992. On 19 March 1991, only ten days following the violent March 9th Protest that claimed two lives and the ensuing student clashes with the police, Milošević (at that time the President of Serbia) came to the University of Belgrade in order to face the students where student leader Đilas got a chance to address him in an uncomfortable encounter recorded by the TV cameras. Later, Đilas was part of an official student delegation that Milošević received. As a student leader/activist, in June 1992, Đilas appeared on RTS interview programme \"Razgovor s povodom\" thus getting 50 minutes of air time on state television, which he used to further criticize Milošević's policies. All throughout this period Đilas continuously received offers from two largest opposition parties at that time, the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) and the Democratic Party (DS) to join their ranks, but he refused.\n\nIn the coming years, he continued to actively participate in various anti-Milošević rallies between 1996 and 2000, although by now his activism took a back seat to his budding business career in the mass media market.\n\nSince the mid-1990s, Đilas is very active in the Serbian media market. After completion of the journalistic career has entered into marketing business as media director at the agency \"Saatchi & Saatchi\". He then went to Prague, and there with a few friends opened company in 1995. He began his first business in Belgrade 1998.\n\nHe has a minority stake in a limited-liability company called Multikom Group whose ownership is dividid between Đilas (25%), Dragoslav Ilić (42%), Milica Delević (25%) and Nebojša Garić (8%).\n\nThe company is also active in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, and Montenegro.\n\nSince 2001, Đilas co-owns (through Multikom Group) a closed joint stock company called Direct Media, a media company that sells advertising space in various Serbian electronic media outlets. The company also offers ad rights in large sporting events such as the World Cup, Olympics, and World Basketball Championships.\n\nEven though he was politically active in various forms since his early youth, Đilas officially entered politics in 2004 when he joined the Democratic Party (DS).\n\nOn October 1, 2004 Đilas became the director of the People's Office, instituted by the newly elected President of Serbia Boris Tadić. The creation of People's Office was one of Tadić's election promises at the June 2004 presidential elections. Đilas stayed in the position until May 2007 when the new Government of Serbia was finally formed by the DS and the DSS-NS coalition almost 5 months after January 2007 parliamentary election. He became the Minister without Portfolio in charge of the National Investment Plan (NIP).\n\nHis tenure, however, was short-lived since the government fell in February 2008 following the declaration of independence of Kosovo.\n\nĐilas' time in office was marked by frequent vicious clashes with the government colleague Minister for Capital Investment Velimir Ilić. The two already had history of public feuding when they became part of the same cabinet in May 2007. It didn't take long for their feud to reignite and in October 2007 things boiled over when Ilić placed an angry, obscenity-laced phone call to Đilas' office, the transcript of which ended up in Serbian media.\n\nOn 19 August 2008, Đilas was sworn in as the new Mayor of Belgrade.\n\nDuring the 2008 Belgrade mayoral election campaign, Đilas was often denounced as a \"tycoon\" by the Liberal Democratic Party due to his amassed personal wealth. There was even a wall-spraying campaign with the phrase \"Đilas Tajkun\" written on various buildings around Belgrade. However, the party denied any link with the sprayed writings.\n\nHe was dismissed as mayor on 18 November 2013 and Siniša Mali was appointed as President of the Temporary Council of Belgrade.\n\nAfter Belgrade City Council elections in 2018, Đilas announced a formation of a new opposition political alliance - as a counterweight to ruling SNS. His ambition was to gather all opposition political parties and organizations, regardless of their political orientation. He partially succeeded in this, and SzS was officially formed in September 2018, gathering both center left parties like DS and center right parties like NS. Since Đilas welcomed Dveri (a right wing political party) into the alliance, some liberal and left leaning organizations (notably Saša Janković's PSG) refused to take part in the alliance, though they stated they are willing to cooperate on various subjects, especially on the matter of election organization.\n\nĐilas is the founder and vice president of Naša Srbija humanitarian organisation for Serbian children who were left without one or both parents in the wars in the former Yugoslavia.\n\nHe divorced in 2007. He was married to Milica Delević from 1994, who is also politically active. From fall 2003 until mid-August 2004 she headed the Office for Cooperation with the European Union under the Council of Ministers. Then from 2007 until 2008, she was the deputy to Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremić. From November 2008, she is heading the Office for European Integration in the Serbian Government. They have two daughters together, Sofija and Jovana.\n\nIn September 2009, 42-year-old Đilas married the 28-year-old doctor Iva Pelević in a low-key civic ceremony. A year later they had a church wedding. They have a daughter named Ana and a son named Vuk. In 2013 they divorced.\n\n\n"}

In October of the same year he became the Department Head at the Moscow Office of ANAS GROUP. In January 1995 he was appointed Managing Director of the Company, whose duties included estimation of competitive environment and competitiveness of manufacture of chemical production at the level of countries, regions of Russia and countries of the Central and Eastern Europe, as well as drawing up of reviews on condition and development prospects of separate chemical companies and enterprises.\n\nIn February 1996, Kilzie was appointed Managing Director of FABA CHEMICALS GmbH, where he was engaged in development and implementation of projects on optimization of direct supplies of raw materials from Russia and CIS countries with arrangement of project financing, insurance of project risks in Russia.\n\nIn January 2000, he became the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Creon Advisory Company (Moscow). Since May 2012 he has been working as the Chairman of the Board of Directors at Creon Energy.\n\nIn 2001, Kilzie established the first independent industry-specific information agency RCC (Russian Chemical Consulting) GmbH, which has become one of the most authoritative corporate information portals in Russia in the area.\n\nIn 2002, CREON Group was founded and Kilzie supervised the process of elaboration and estimation of the business plans, worked on technical and economical grounds of investment projects, conducted condition researches and prospects of development of separate oil and gas chemical companies and enterprises, and estimated the commercial potential of new technologies and products (ethylene, propylene, associated petroleum gas, liquefied hydro carbonic gas, liquefied natural gas). In 2012 Kilzie took charge of CREON Energy, which has been the official adviser of the Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation throughout several years, in particular in the classification of questions regarding liquefied hydro carbonic gas, which is considered to be the basis for customs-tariff regulation.\n\nAt the same 2012, a unique company entered the market - OJSC INVENTRA, focusing on consultancy services exclusively for polymers industry and the related produced products. And 2017 saw the rise of the company CREON Chemicals specializing in agro chemistry and special chemistry.\n\nIn 2016, Kilzie took the lead in the establishment of a direct investment fund, CREON Energy Fund SICAV-SIF, focused on investments in the chemicals sector in the Russian Federation. The estimated overall amount of fund investments exceeds €100mln. The Fund is investing in the projects at their initial stage, in growing and expanding Russian and CIS companies, as well as in eco-projects of 'green' economy and alternative energy. The managing company and the unlimited partner is CREON Capital S.a.r.l. with the head office located in Luxembourg. The partners of CREON Capital are Caceis Bank Luxembourg S.A., Ernst & Young S.A., Arendt & Medernach S.A.\n\nKilzie speaks fluent Russian, English, German, Arabic and Spanish. He is married and has five children.\n\nAs the head of CREON Group, Kilzie took part in management of some projects. Thus, since 2014 CREON Group has acted as the adviser and the operator of the civil-engineering design of methanol manufacturing factory Methanol Serverny which is implemented by NGSK company in Ust-Luga (Leningrad region), and is responsible for full-scale project realization.\n\nMoreover, after several years of cooperation, CREON Group developed a separate Gazprom Eastern Gas Program including a Feasibility Study (FS), offers on production technologies selection and evaluation of licensed extraction facilities. One of the most important factors of this program was an increase in helium production, based on the hypothesis that the development of Chayadinsk and Kovyktinsk extraction facilities might change dramatically the situation on the world gas market. Moreover, the estimation of the Vladivostok LNG was conducted – the liquefied natural gas manufacturing factory (LNG) with the capacity of at least 15 mln tonnes per year.\n\nWithin the frames of work on the KazAzot project (unique producer of ammonia and ammonium nitrate in the Republic of Kazakhstan) the efforts of the Group’s consultants were focused on execution of a full technical and technological company audit (due diligence). The strategy for the company’s further development was also elaborated together with the choice of licenses and company’s management schemes. For Sibmethachem company from Tomsk, the Group prepared the site development with due consideration of new tendencies in methanol production. As a result, in 2015, Sibmethachem hit the record production figures for methanol (874 thousand tones). At the instructions of GazpromNeft Company, the CREON Group developed a strategy for the development of oil technologies sector with identification of priority directions in development and analysis of existing and projected products portfolio. At the request of one of the largest oil-producing companies in Russia, the CREON Group worked out the justification of the investment project on the basis of market analysis for benzene production facilities across Russia and the CIS countries, with a forecast up to 2035.\n\nOverall working experience amounts to more than 20 years of experience in investments and international petrochemicals consulting industry, including sixteen years of heading the Board of Directors of CREON Group of Companies.\n\nIn 2014, together with WWF, Kilzie and Creon Energy organized The first , within Rational Approach Project. Rating included 19 leading companies on volumes of oil and natural gas extraction. Rating grade was calculated for each company as average for 28 rating criteria. According to calculations, Surgutneftegaz Company became the winner; Sakhalin Energy comes second place, Gazprom is on the third place.\n\nThe principal idea behind this rating is to encourage companies to make good use of hydrocarbon resources, to ensure environmental protection and an ecologically and socially responsible business in Russia. This project was developed in order to provide ‘greening’ of the petrochemicals industry, to include environmental operations into the list of priorities of Oil&Gas Companies and to develop regulatory activities amongst the State authorities of the Russian Federation. Today, this is the only rating in Russia that serves as a tool in evaluation of levels of environmental responsibility of all companies extracting more than 1.5 mln tonnes of oil per year.\n\nWhen the results of the second Rating (end of 2015) were published, the national petrochemical industry journal Neftegazovaya Vertikal admitted that over just one year, the Rating has been recognised by the companies of this industry, which was particularly reflected in the meeting between representatives of the petrochemicals sector at the premises of CREON Group, which was dedicated to the methodology correction. This meeting was attended by representatives of 11 companies, who put forward more than 70 proposals. The Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (RUIE) included the Rating in its compilation of corporate practice named “Business. Russia. Ecology. People.” The methodology of the research, which has no equivalents, has already attracted interest from abroad, and this helps in reinforcing a positive image of Russia overseas.\n\nThe Rating is carried out annually and its publication is considered as a major event in the ecological field of petrochemicals sector in the Russian Federation. It includes such companies as Arktik Gaz, Bashneft, BelkamNeft, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Zarubezhneft, Irkutsk Oil Company, LUKOIL, NNK, Novatek, Rosneft, RussNeft, Salym Petroleum Development, Sakhalin Energy, , Surgutneftegaz, Tatneft, , Total Razvedka Razrabotka Rossiya, Transneft, and Exxon NL.\n\nAll expenditures for elaboration, estimation, corrections and drawing results are financed by Kilzie.\n\nIn October 2015, The Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), in association with the Centre for Strategic Studies (SAM) of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and with the support of CREON Group, held an international conference: “Russia & Turkey – Forging Multidimensional Partnership”. The purpose of the conference was to discuss current aspects of collaboration between Russia and Turkey, mechanisms for implementation of joint infrastructure projects, approaches of the two countries to regional problems.\n\nIn May 2016, RIAC also held in cooperation with CREON Group and Russian-Chinese Committee for Friendship and Development, the second international conference: “Russia & China – Towards New Quality of Bilateral Relations”. The event was held with the support of governmental agencies of the Russian Government and the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The purpose of this conference was to assess the status and development tendencies of Russian-Chinese relations, to identify main achievements and unsettled issues of bilateral cooperation and to prepare proposals for the leaderships of both China and Russia on further development of strategic partnership. The conference became a significant event in the preparation process of Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to China at the end of June 2016, and received massive coverage in the Russian, Chinese and English-language media.\n\nIn general, for all working experience of the CREON Group and by Kilzie personally, more than 300 business conferences, congresses and forums have been held, dedicated to the issues of extraction and processing of fossil carbon fuels, processing of polymers, and development of agrochemicals. Some of the events have contributed to formation of an innovative vector of development in extracting and recycling branches of the Russian economy.\n\nIn 2007 the Group organized the first conference in the country on associated petroleum gas in last decade for subject and complex discussion of problems on effective processing liquefied natural gas (LNG) that subsequently promoted the adoption of law, forcing all oil companies by 2012 to provide 95 percent useful recycling of associated petroleum gas on all of their sites. By the seventh international conference \"Associated petroleum gas 2016\", a number of leading players of oil branch had already reached recycling level of 95% or have come close to it. However, there were complexities with recycling liquefied natural gas (LNG) on the remote, complex or new sites, and the level of recycling liquefied natural gas (LNG) became one of the key parameters of the rating of ecological safety of the oil and gas companies of the Russian Federation.\n\n2010 witnessed the organization of unique in Russia debatable platform on coverage of helium market, which has no analogues in Europe. As a result development of manufacture of helium in Russia has justified CREON Group predictions about a high export potential of this product. The director for development and strategy of Gazprom Marketing and Trading France Didier Lebo at the conference \"Helium 2016\" has informed that with the start of Amur gas recycling factory of Gazprom for the first time one source of manufacture will be enough to cover predicted deficiency in the world market at various scenarios within the next 30 years.\n\nAmong other key themes of the actions organised by CREON company and Kilzie manufacture may be highlighted LNG/CNG, LCG, petrol, diesel, mineral fertilizers, caustic soda, sulfur and sulfuric acid, etc.\n\nIn March 2012, Creon Company organized «Caustic Soda 2012» Conference. The key issue of the conference was cartel agreement case, initiated by the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) against manufacturers of caustic soda and chloric production headed by United Trade Company (UTK).\n\nIn 2014, Creon Energy Group organized the Plastics of Russia National Forum and established the self-titled award aimed at encouragement of Russian companies and enterprises engaged in the formation of the country's plastic industry. First annual Forum was supported by the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation and Analytical Center for the Government of the Russian Federation. According to Kilzie, plastic converting became the national basis and is able to be a key point for development of a significant segment of the Russian industry. Speeches at this forum proved the significant opportunities for development of domestic market of plastics production in all segments of the national economy.\n\nIn 2016, the Plastics of Russia Award had eleven categories for polymer products producers and processors. Among the winners of the award were recognised market leaders (including Kazanorgsintez, Ufaorgsintex, SIBUR and Mosoblgaz companies) together with new market players, such as the recently-opened polymer film plant in Rostov Region Waterfall Pro.\n\nThe award ceremony was covered by leading trade publications and business media, including \"Expert\" magazine, the Prime agency for economic news, the PRO-Business television network, and other major organizations.\n\n"}

{"id": "2732241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2732241", "title": "Food miles", "text": "Food miles\n\nFood miles is the distance food is transported from the time of its production until it reaches the consumer. Food miles are one factor used when assessing the environmental impact of food, including the impact on global warming.\n\nThe concept of food miles originated in the early 2018s in the United Kingdom. It was conceived by Professor Tim Lang at the Sustainable Agriculture Food and Environment (SAFE) Alliance and first appeared in print in a report “The Food Miles Report: The dangers of long-distance food transport”, researched and written by Angela Paxton.\n\nSome scholars believe that an increase in the distance food travels is due to the globalization of trade; the focus of food supply bases into fewer, larger districts; drastic changes in delivery patterns; the increase in processed and packaged foods; and making fewer trips to the supermarket. These make a small part of the greenhouse gas emissions created by food; 83% of overall emissions of CO are in production phases.\n\nSeveral studies compare emissions over the entire food cycle, including production, consumption, and transport. These include estimates of food-related emissions of greenhouse gas 'up to the farm gate' versus 'beyond the farm gate'. In the UK, for example, agricultural-related emissions may account for approximately 40% of the overall food chain (including retail, packaging, fertilizer manufacture, and other factors), whereas greenhouse gases emitted in transport account for around 12% of overall food-chain emissions. Researchers are currently working to provide the public with more information.\n\nThe concept of \"food miles\" has been criticised, and food miles are not always correlated with the actual environmental impact of food production. In comparison, the percentage of total energy used in home food preparation is 26% and in food processing is 29%, far greater than transportation.\n\nThe concept of food miles is part of the broader issue of sustainability which deals with a large range of environmental, social and economic issues, including local food. The term was coined by Tim Lang (now Professor of Food Policy, City University, London) who says: \"The point was to highlight the hidden ecological, social and economic consequences of food production to consumers in a simple way, one which had objective reality but also connotations.\" The increased distance traveled by food in developed countries was caused by the globilization of food trade, which increased by 4 times since 1961. Food that is transported by road produces more carbon emissions than any other form of transported food. Road transport produces 60% of the world's food transport carbon emissions. Air transport produces 20% of the world's food transport carbon emissions. Rail and sea transport produce 10% each of the world's food transport carbon emissions.\n\nAlthough it was never intended as a complete measure of environmental impact, it has come under attack as an ineffective means of finding the true environmental impact. For example, a DEFRA report in 2005 undertaken by researchers at AEA Technology Environment, entitled \"The Validity of Food Miles as an Indicator of Sustainable Development\", included findings that \"the direct environmental, social and economic costs of food transport are over £9 billion each year, and are dominated by congestion.\" The report also indicates that it is not only how far the food has travelled but the method of travel in all parts of the food chain that is important to consider. Many trips by personal cars to shopping centres would have a negative environmental impact compared to transporting a few truckloads to neighbourhood stores that can be easily reached by walking or cycling. More emissions are created by the drive to the supermarket to buy air freighted food than was created by the air freighting in the first place. Also, the positive environmental effects of organic farming may be compromised by increased transportation, unless it is produced by local farms. The Carbon Trust notes that to understand the carbon emissions from food production, all the carbon-emitting processes that occur as a result of getting food from the field to our plates need to be considered, including production, origin, seasonality and home care.\n\nA recent study led by Professor Miguel Gomez (Applied Economics and Management), at Cornell University and supported by the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future found that in many instances, the supermarket supply chain did much better in terms of food miles and fuel consumption for each pound compared to farmers markets. It suggests that selling local foods through supermarkets may be more economically viable and sustainable than through farmers markets.\n\nWith processed foods that are made of many different ingredients, it is very complicated, though not impossible, to calculate the CO2 emissions from transport by multiplying the distance travelled of each ingredient, by the carbon intensity of the mode of transport (air, road or rail). However, as both Prof. Lang and the original Food Miles report noted, the resulting number – although interesting, cannot give the whole picture of how sustainable – or not – a food product is.\n\nWal-Mart publicized a press releasing that stated food traveled 1500 miles before it reaches customers. The shocking statistics aroused public concern about food miles. According to Jane Black, a food writer who covers food politics, the number was derived from a small database. The 22 terminal markets from which the data was collected handled 30% of the United States produce.\n\nAccording to Oxfam researchers, there are many other aspects of the agricultural processing and the food supply chain that also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions which are not taken into account by simple \"food miles\" measurements. There are benefits to be gained by improving livelihoods in poor countries through agricultural development. Smallholder farmers in poor countries can often improve their income and standard of living if they can sell to distant export markets for higher value horticultural produce, moving away from the subsistence agriculture of producing staple crops for their own consumption or local markets.\n\nHowever, exports from poor countries do not always benefit poor people. Unless the product has a Fairtrade label, or a label from another robust and independent scheme, food exports might make a bad situation worse. Only a very small percentage of what importers pay will end up in the hands of plantation workers. Wages are often very low and working conditions bad and sometimes dangerous. Sometimes the food grown for export takes up land that had been used to grow food for local consumption, so local people can go hungry.\n\nResearchers say a more complete environmental assessment of food that consumers buy needs to take into account how the food has been produced and what energy is used in its production. A recent DEFRA case study indicated that tomatoes grown in Spain and transported to the United Kingdom may have a lower carbon footprint in terms of energy than heated greenhouses in the United Kingdom.\n\nAccording to German researchers, the food miles concept misleads consumers because the size of transportation and production units is not taken into account. Using the methodology of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in accordance with ISO 14040, entire supply chains providing German consumers with food were investigated, comparing local food with food of European and global provenance. Large-scale agriculture reduces unit costs associated with food production and transportation, leading to increased efficiency and decreased energy use per kilogram of food by economies of scale. Research from the Justus Liebig University Giessen show that small food production operations may cause even more environmental impact than bigger operations in terms of energy use per kilogram, even though food miles are lower. Case studies of lamb, beef, wine, apples, fruit juices and pork show that the concept of food miles is too simple to account for all factors of food production. \n\nA 2006 research report from the Agribusiness and Economics Research Unit at Lincoln University, New Zealand counters claims about food miles by comparing total energy used in food production in Europe and New Zealand, taking into account energy used to ship the food to Europe for consumers. The report states, \"New Zealand has greater production efficiency in many food commodities compared to the UK. For example New Zealand agriculture tends to apply fewer fertilizers (which require large amounts of energy to produce and cause significant CO2 emissions) and animals are able to graze year round outside eating grass instead of large quantities of brought-in feed such as concentrates. In the case of dairy and sheep meat production NZ is by far more energy efficient, even including the transport cost, than the UK, twice as efficient in the case of dairy, and four times as efficient in case of sheep meat. In the case of apples, NZ is more energy-efficient even though the energy embodied in capital items and other inputs data was not available for the UK.\"\n\nOther researchers have contested the claims from New Zealand. Professor Gareth Edwards-Jones has said that the arguments “in favour of New Zealand apples shipped to the UK is probably true only or about two months a year, during July and August, when the carbon footprint for locally grown fruit doubles because it comes out of cool stores.”\n\nStudies by Dr. Christopher Weber et al. of the total carbon footprint of food production in the U.S. have shown transportation to be of minor importance, compared to the carbon emissions resulting from pesticide and fertilizer production, and the fuel required by farm and food processing equipment.\n\nFarm animals account for between 20% and 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions. That figure includes the clearing of land to feed and graze the animals. Clearing land of trees, and cultivation, are the main drivers of farming emissions. Deforestation eliminates carbon sinks, accelerating the process of climate change. Cultivation, including the use of synthetic fertilisers, releases greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide. Nitrogen fertiliser is especially demanding of fossil fuels, as producing a tonne of it takes 1.5 tonnes of oil.\n\nMeanwhile, it’s increasingly recognised that meat and dairy are the largest sources of food-related emissions. The UK’s consumption of meat and dairy products (including imports) accounts for about 8% of national greenhouse gas emissions related to consumption.\n\nAccording to a study by engineers Christopher Weber and H. Scott Matthews of Carnegie Mellon University, of all the greenhouse gases emitted by the food industry, only 4% comes from transporting the food from producers to retailers. The study also concluded that adopting a vegetarian diet, even if the vegetarian food is transported over very long distances, does far more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, than does eating a locally grown diet. They also concluded that \"Shifting less than one day per week’s worth of calories from red meat and dairy products to chicken, fish, eggs, or a vegetable-based diet achieves more GHG reduction than buying all locally sourced food.\" In other words, the amount of red meat consumption is much more important than food miles.\n\nA commonly ignored element is the last mile. For example, a gallon of gasoline could transport 5 kg of meat over by road (40 tonner at 8 mpg) in bulk transport, or it could transport a single consumer only 30 or to buy that meat. Thus foods from a distant farm that are transported in bulk to a nearby store consumer can have a lower footprint than foods a consumer picks up directly from a farm that is within driving distance but farther away than the store. This can mean that doorstep deliveries of food by companies can lead to lower carbon emissions or energy use than normal shopping practices. Relative distances and mode of transportation make this calculation complicated. For example, consumers can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the last mile by walking, bicycling, or taking public transport. Another impact is that goods being transported by large ships very long distances can have lower associated carbon emissions or energy use than the same goods traveling by truck a much shorter distance.\n\nLifecycle analysis, a technique that meshes together a wide range of different environmental criteria including emissions and waste, is a more holistic way of assessing the real environmental impact of the food we eat. The technique accounts for energy input and output involved in the production, processing, packaging and transport of food. It also factors in resource depletion, air pollution and water pollution and waste generation/municipal solid waste.\n\nA number of organisations are developing ways of calculating the carbon cost or lifecycle impact of food and agriculture. Some are more robust than others but, at the moment, there is no easy way to tell which ones are thorough, independent and reliable, and which ones are just marketing hype.\n\nEven a full lifecycle analysis accounts only for the environmental effects of food production and consumption. However it is one of the widely agreed three pillars of sustainable development, namely environmental, social and economic.\n\nfoodpocketstats/FoodPocketbook2009.pdf.\nLondon/Medway, Kent.\n\n"}

The \"Sunday Times\" Rich List estimated his wealth at £162m (U$238m) , making him the 497th richest person in Britain. The Romanian magazine \"Capital\" reckoned Timiș to be the 9th richest Romanian, estimating his wealth at $290m . In 2012 he became the richest Romanian with a net worth of £1.34 billion (US$2.13 billion).\n\nBorn in Borșa, Maramureș County, he graduated from a vocational school for auto mechanics. He left Romania and settled as a refugee in Perth, Australia. Whilst in Australia he was convicted of possession of heroin with intent to supply and fined A$27,000.\n\nTimiș started his own transport company in Australia, which owned only one truck driven by himself. However, it went bankrupt in 1986 with debts of 15,806 AUD. According to Jurnalul Național, Timiș failed to declare this fact in the CV he published when he listed the company Gabriel Resources on the Toronto Stock Exchange, as required by law.\n\nIn 1992, he became the CEO of Morwest Holdings Pty Ltd, the first of his gold mining businesses. Timiș and two Australian miners dug for six months for gold in a region called Mosquito Creek, but the result was a failure. In the meantime, he founded another three companies: Riverdale Mining, Timis Corporation, and Carpathian Investments, together with Ioana Timiș and his sister, Ioana Majdik. However, these companies were liquidated by Timiș, and all creditors were paid in full.\n\nAnother setback was Timiș' investment in Pneumatic Systems International Pty Ltd. In 2001, he quit his investment and kept only 11.6% of the company, administered via a new company, Regal Group Services, in the British Virgin Islands tax haven. According to an ex-manager of the company, in 2003, those shares were worth under $1,500 AUD.\n\nRegal Group Services changed its name and headquarters, and is currently listed on the London Stock Exchange as Regal Petroleum. This company is associated with a Romanian company, Global Mineral Resources, owned by a son of a former Romanian senator of the Democratic Party, Teodor Hăucă, who used to be secretary of the Economic Commission of the Romanian Senate between 1996 and 2000.\n\nIn 1995, Timiș founded Gabriel Resources NL Australia, and in the autumn of the same year, the Romanian state-owned mining company \"Regia Autonomă a Cuprului din Deva\" (RAC) announced that it was searching for a partnership with a foreign company for the mining of precious metals from the tailings in Roșia Montană and Gurabarză-Brad. However, Jurnalul Național claims that it has documents indicating a collaboration signed by RAC Deva and Gabriel Resources one day before the announcement was published, on 4 September 1995. Also, RAC claimed it received several offers, including from another Australian company, Lycopodium Pty Ltd., but that company has denied RAC's claim.\n\nAccording to ASIC, in April 1996, Gabriel Resources NL had financial problems with its creditors, including the National Australia Bank Ltd, and Timiș started a new company after paying all creditors in full, Gabriel Resources Limited, registered in the Jersey tax haven. The mining contract was redirected to the new company. Timiș had an 80% stake in the joint company. The Romanian Agency of Mineral Resources declared that the new contract was unfavourable to the Romanian state, but it was allowed by the Government after a parliamentary vote.\n\nTimiș had access to various databanks of the Romanian research institutes of mineralogy and got data on the area. His company also hired relevant scientists and an ex-officer of the Topographic Department of the Romanian Ministry of Defence who mapped the area.\n\nGabriel Resources sent 80 tonnes of ore to a research lab in Australia to measure the gold content. The ore was high in gold, and the market value of Gabriel Resources soared to $75 million. Timiș obtained a $3 million loan from the Rothschild bank in the United States. Between 1999–2000, the area being mined was increased from 12 km² to 22 km², and then to 42.8 km².\n\nThe resulting project in Roșia Montana has been a source of much controversy, with local people lining up on both sides of the issue, and some national and international environmental groups joining the opposition. One source of controversy involved the method used for mining, gold cyanidation, which causes pollution. The company hopes to eventually extract 300 tonnes of gold and 1600 tonnes of silver from the area but the project is currently on hold.\n\nRegal Petroleum, founded by Timiș in November 1996, was listed on the London Alternative Investment Market and owned some oil and gas resources in Romania and Ukraine. However, it became famous after the September 2003 acquisition of 60% of an oilfield located in Kavala, Greece. The Regal board hoped that the company's survey team had found one of the largest oil deposits in Europe: up to a billion barrels. The oil was allegedly under so much pressure that it almost destroyed the drilling platform.\n\nThis hype drove Regal's share price up to a peak of 509p, with the company's market value reaching £500m, making it one of the highest-valued companies of the Alternative Investment Market. Many private investors and respectable institutions (including Merrill Lynch, Commerzbank, Artemis and Schroders) invested more than £45m in the company. Days later, Timiș secretly agreed to sell the company's assets and the resigned as chief executive of the company.\n\nBy mid-2005, it was clear that Regal's oil field contained oil but not in commercial amounts. The flow rates were around 30 barrels a day and \"deemed to be non-commercial\". In a few hours, the stock fell by more than 60%, and as of June 2006, the share price was at 65p, less than 20% of the peak price. In 2010, the company was still worth about £200m, and had cash reserves of £80m, In February 2006, Regal lost its Ukraine gas production license in a trial but got it back through appeal one year later.\n\nIn June 2005, an environmental group, Alburnus Maior, asked the Romanian Supreme Court, under the freedom of information laws, whether Timiș was under any investigations. The answer was that his name was linked with three dossiers investigated by the organised crime department. However, Timiș denied all the claims and no charges were ever filed. Later queries to the Romanian administration on this subject were given the answer that there are no investigations concerning Timiș.\n\nDue to the collapse in the share price of this company, the Alternative Investment Market decided in 2006 to toughen regulations for companies in the natural resources sector and to hire experts who would prevent future bubbles followed by price fluctuations.\n\nThe company has, however, recently been given back licences that had been frozen by the government, and has begun to produce oil again.\n\nIn 2005, the Timiș Trust bought 30% of the shares of the Sierra Leone Diamond Corporation, via the Trust's Bermuda-registered Timis Diamond Corporation Limited. SLDC holds mineral rights over a third of the area of Sierra Leone in the northern part of the country, including some important diamond fields and the Tonkolili & Marampa Iron Ore Projects. The company is also exploring for uranium at Lovetta, and for gold and base metals in the Sula Mountains, Gori Hills and Nimini Hills. On 16 August 2007 the AIM-listed company was renamed African Minerals Limited (AMI.L) to reflect these other interests., On 15 March 2010 AMI announced an initial Mineral Resource estimate of over 10 billion tonnes of iron ore (independently valued) at an average grade of 29.9% Total Iron in the Numbara and Simbili targets at Tonkolili.\nTimiș, who is executive chairman of the company, increased his shareholding to 34% in June 2006 and to 34.6% (40,875,002 shares) in September 2006. the entire company was worth £45m (US$65m).\n\nIn 2015, Frank Timis together with then CEO Alan Watling and CFO Matthew Hird took African Minerals into administration. The company has been forced to sell its 75% share to Shandong Iron and Steel Group for a grossly undervalued sum. Half year results for AMI were impressive, the Company posted a quarterly production of 4mt – an improvement of 81% on the prior 3 months. In January 2014 AMI hit its operating capacity for the first time, producing 5.3mt and exporting 4.6mt in the first quarter. Earnings for the Company were US$203m in 2013 compared with a US$26.5m in 2012. Despite the best efforts of the team and management, the continued downturn in iron ore prices, slowing global growth and China’s appetite and the Ebola crisis (which infected almost 15,000 and claimed 4,000 lives) left AMI exposed. The downturn in iron ore prices from US$128.12 in January 2014 decreased rapidly over coming months reaching US$68 in December 2014 and US$63 in February 2015. This combined with the Ebola crises created a perfect storm for the beleaguered mining company. Shandong refused to release remaining funds (US$100m) and their lawyers Linklater’s recognised a perfect opportunity to take over buying 75% of AMI shares at a grossly undervalued price and through a process that was anything but transparent. The Board, management and Timis fought passionately to keep the company from going to administration, but given the perfect storm it was facing and like many other junior mining Companies then and since, there was no alternative but administration.\nTimis lost all of his $450m investment as did the institution investors, shareholders and bond holders. AMI is now operating as Shan Steel under Chinese leadership.\n\nTimiș was formerly the non-executive chairman of African Petroleum, he stepped off the board and any role in Governance in African Petroleum in October 2014 and this remained a precondition of the subsequent and current listing on the Oslo Bors. He remains the founder and a supportive shareholder but plays no other role African Petroleum Corporation is a company with various oil and gas operations in West Africa, listed on the National Stock Exchange of Australia (NSX: AOQ) and Oslo Bors (APCL).\n\nTimiș is a non-executive director at International Petroleum Limited, an Australian-domiciled, NSX-listed (NSX code: IOP), oil and gas exploration and production company.\n\nTimiș is CEO of Pan African Minerals Limited, which has various operations in Africa, including exploration of a large manganese deposit at Tambao in Burkina Faso.\n\nIn 2000 Frank Timiș bought 15% of European Goldfields (EGU.L), a Yukon-incorporated company listed in Toronto and on AIM that owns 95% of Hellas Gold S.A. 21% of that stake was acquired by EGU from Timiș himself in 2004 for $77.3m, paid a third in cash and two-thirds in EGU shares, taking his stake to 18.9%. Hellas has three mining projects in Greece (Stratoni, Skouries and Olympias) and two companies in Romania: 100% of the shares of European Goldfields Deva (with projects at Voia and the Cainel perimeter) and 80% of the shares in Deva Gold, Certej Mine, Bolcana and Băița-Crăciunești.\n\nHe sold his entire stake in the company between January and April 2006.\n\nTimiș and his wife Carmen Timiș are major contributors to numerous causes, particularly those focused on children. The organisations they support include Street Child of Sierra Leone, the Carmen Timiș & Lucia B. Centre for Children, F.R.O.D.O. (Foundation for the Relief of Disabled Orphans), and UK charity Anorexia and Bulimia Care (ABC).\n\nFrank also funded the restoration of a celebrated icon kept at Romania's Namaiesti Monastery, and provides financial support to a number monasteries, convents and a hermitage in Romania. On the occasion of the Heroes Double Dip swim across the English Channel by two British soldiers, Frank donated £100,000 of his personal funds to Help for Heroes, a UK charity providing practical support for service personnel wounded in recent armed conflicts.\n\nTimiș' various companies are engaged in a variety of corporate social responsibility projects. The Timiș Corporation has formed a partnership with ProtoPharma dedicated to advancing research into treatments for both malaria and substance abuse. The corporation is also a major sponsor of Sparks (a UK charity funding research into childhood diseases); has funded construction of a well on school grounds in Tonkolili, Sierra Leone; and donated €100,000 to the catholic charity Don Bosco Fambul to launch the Basics Mobil project (a bus that delivers health and community services to street children in Freetown).\n\nTimiș' company African Petroleum has partnered with Sightsavers to fund training for 18 cataract surgeons, ophthalmic nurses and ophthalmologists to work throughout West Africa. Sister company African Minerals funds Sierra Leone's national football team, the Leone Stars. Also, Timiș' International Petroleum is a significant sponsor of the Kazakh National Ballet.\n\nIn 2010, he donated £100,000 to the Christian Party for the United Kingdom General Election.\n"}

Most often, business entities are formed to sell a product or a service. There are many types of business entities defined in the legal systems of various countries. These include corporations, cooperatives, partnerships, sole traders, limited liability companies and other specifically permitted and labelled types of entities. The specific rules vary by country and by state or province. Some of these types are listed below, by country. For guidance, approximate equivalents in the company law of English-speaking countries are given in most cases, for example:\n\nHowever, the regulations governing particular types of entities, even those described as roughly equivalent, differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. When creating or restructuring a business, the legal responsibilities will depend on the type of business entity chosen.\n\n\n\n\n\nDutch, French or German names may be used.\n\n\n\n\nThere are three main types of business entity in Brunei, namely sole proprietorship, partnership and company.\n\nA private company contains the term \"Sendirian Berhad\" or \"Sdn. Bhd.\" as part of its name where as for a public company \"Berhad\" or \"Bhd.\" is used.\n\n\n\nIn Canada entities can be incorporated under either federal or provincial (or territorial) law. Unlimited liability corporations can be formed in Alberta \"AULC\" and Nova Scotia \"NSULC\".\n\nThe word or expression \"Limited\", \"Limitée\", \"Incorporated\", \"Incorporée\", \"Corporation\" or \"Société par actions de régime fédéral\" or the corresponding abbreviation \"Ltd.\", \"Ltée\", \"Inc.\", \"Corp.\" or \"S.A.R.F.\" forms part of the name of every entity incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act (R.S., 1985, c. C-44). ≈ Ltd. or Plc (UK)\n\nAs an exception, entities registered prior to 1985 may continue to be designated \"Société commerciale canadienne\" or by the abbreviation \"S.C.C.\"\n\nUnder the Canada Cooperatives Act (1998, c. 1), a co-operative must have the word \"cooperative\", \"co-operative\", \"coop\", \"co-op\", \"coopérative\", \"united\" or \"pool\", or another grammatical form of any of those words, as part of its name.\n\nUnlike in many other Western countries, Canadian businesses generally only have one form of incorporation available. The aforementioned AULC and NSULC are generally not used as operating business structures, but are instead used to create favorable tax positions for either Americans investing in Canada or vice versa.\n\nRather, Canadian businesses are generally formed under one of the following structures:\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of legal person business entities:\n\n\nTypes of natural person business entities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn SE or SCE may be created by registration in any of the EU/EEA Member States, and is subject to the European Company Statute. It may relocate its registered office to any other EU/EEA Member State with minimal formalities.\n\n\nThe abbreviations are usually in Finnish, but Swedish names may also be used either as is or in combination with Finnish, e.g. \"Oy Yritys Ab\".\n\nIn the corporations of real estate law, the ownership or membership may be vested either in the real property or in a legal or natural person, depending on the corporation type. In many cases, the membership or ownership of such corporation is obligatory for a person or property that fulfils the legal requirements for membership or wishes to engage in certain activities.\n\nIn addition to native types, European Union types are implemented:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Hungary, business entities are mainly regulated by the Companies Act of 2006, the Companies Registration Act of 2006 and the new Civil Code of 2013. All companies are required to indicate their type in their name.\n\n\n\n\nSituation in Ireland is similar to United Kingdom below, though without the class \"Community Interest Company\". There were two forms of Company Limited by Guarantee, but only the form \"without a share capital\" is now used. Irish names may also be used, such as \"cpt\" (cuideachta phoibli theoranta) for plc, and \"Teo\" (Teoranta) for Ltd.\n\n\n\nBusiness corporations are referred to as \"kaisha\" (会社) and are formed under the Companies Act of 2005.

This form is a little bit specific and was created for companies that are domiciled registered in other countries and have its part in Montenegro.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompanies are registered on the Companies Register and with a regional Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\nThe Commercial Code establishes the following types of companies:\n\n\n\n\nThere are three main forms of business:\n\n(a) Sole Proprietorship\n(b) Partnership\n(c) Company\n\n\nIn a sole proprietorship, an individual on his/her own account carries out the business or profession. No formal procedure or formality is required for setting up a sole proprietary concern.\n\n\nA partnership is a business relationship entered into by a formal agreement between two or more persons or corporations carrying on a business in common. The capital for a partnership is provided by the partners who are liable for the total debts of the firms and who share the profits and losses of the business concern according to the terms of the partnership agreement.\n\nPartnerships (other than banking companies) are generally limited in size to twenty partners. The interest of a partner is transferable only with the prior consent of the other partner(s). However, a partner's right to a share of the partnership income may be received in trust for another person.\n\nFor taxation purposes, partnerships are classified into:\n\n(i) Registered Firms\n(ii) Unregistered Firms\n\nThe income of the registered firm is subject to Super Tax before distribution to the partners. Also the individual income of the partners is subject to income tax at the usual rates.\n\nFor unregistered firms, income tax is levied on the firm's income and the partners are not liable to pay tax on the shares of profit received from the unregistered firm(s).\n\n\nA company is a legal entity formed under the Companies Ordinance, 1984. It can have share capital or can be formed without share capital.\n\nA company having share capital may be formed as:\n\n(i) A company limited by shares.\n(ii) A company limited by guarantee.\n(iii) An unlimited company.\n\n\nThe liability of its members is limited to the extent of their shares in the paid-up capital of the company. These companies may further be classified as public limited and private limited companies.\n\n\n(i) Restricts the right to transfer its shares;\n(ii) Limits the number of its members to fifty; and;\n(iii) Prohibits any invitation to the public to subscribe for shares or debentures of the company.\n\nA private limited company is required to use the words \"(Private) Limited\" as the last words of its name.\n\n\nMeans a company having the liability of its members limited by memorandum to such amounts as the members may respectively undertake to contribute to the capital of the company in the event of its winding up. A company limited by guarantee is usually formed on a 'non profit basis'. Companies limited by guarantee use the words (Guarantee) Limited\" as the last words of their n\nUnlimited Company\n\nMeans a company having unlimited liability of its members\n\nhttps://www.secp.gov.pk\n\n\n\nOlder forms (now rarely used)\n\n\n\n\"Societăți comerciale\", abbreviated SC (Companies):\n\nlimited liability company \"societate cu raspundere limitata\" (SRL);\njoint stock company \"societate pe actiuni\" (SA);\n\n\n\n\nPrivate Limited Company, Sole Proprietorship and Partnership are the predominant types of business found in Singapore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Code of Obligations (fifth book of Civil Code) (Act No: 6098)\n\nAccording to the Commercial Code (Act No: 6102)\n\nŞahıs şirketleri ≈ Partnerships (Unlike the partnerships in Anglo-American law, they also have legal personality like companies)\n\nSermaye şirketleri ≈ Companies\n\nAccording to the Capital Markets Act (Act No: 6362)\n\nAccording to the Cooperatives Act (Act No: 1136)\n\nOther entitites:\n\n\n\nCompany formation is regulated by the Ukrainian Civil Code and Commercial Code, Law of Commercial companies, Law of stock companies, law and order.\n\n\nIn the United States, the individual states incorporate most businesses. Very few special types are incorporated by the federal government.\n\nFor federal tax purposes, the Internal Revenue Service has separate entity classification rules. Under the tax rules, an entity may be classified as a corporation, a partnership, a Cooperative or a disregarded entity. A corporation may be taxed as either a C corporation or elect to be treated as a Subchapter S corporation. A disregarded entity has one owner (or a married couple as owner) that is not recognized for tax purposes as an entity separate from its owner. Types of disregarded entities include single-member LLCs; qualified sub-chapter S subsidiaries and qualified real estate investment trust subsidiaries. A disregarded entity's transparent tax status does not affect its status under state law. For example, for federal tax purposes, a sole-member LLC (SMLLC) is disregarded, so that all its assets and liabilities are treated as owned by its single member. But under state law, an SMLLC can contract in its own name and its owner is generally not personally liable for the debts and obligations of the entity. To be recognized as a Cooperative for tax purposes Cooperatives must follow certain rules under Sub Chapter T of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nThe key word for a bank is \"national\". A bank chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) must have the word \"national\" in its name. A bank chartered by a state cannot have \"national\" in its name.\n\nFor a savings bank (formerly called a savings and loan association) or credit union, the key word is \"federal\", and the same rules apply; a federally chartered savings bank or credit union must have the word \"federal\" in its name, while a state chartered savings bank or credit union cannot have \"federal\" in its name.\n\n\nMany federal governmental units are specially formed public corporations, while some private organizations have received a charter from Congress.\n\nThe following are the main business designations and types:\n\n\n\n\nRequired designations for corporations, by U.S. state, territory or commonwealth:\n\n\n\n"}

As of 2015, the price had already reached about 14 billion US dollars.\n\nRock's law can be seen as the economic flip side to Moores (first) law – that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles every two years. The latter is a direct consequence of the ongoing growth of the capital-intensive semiconductor industry—innovative and popular products mean more profits, meaning more capital available to invest in ever higher levels of large-scale integration, which in turn leads to creation of even more innovative products.\n\nThe semiconductor industry has always been extremely capital-intensive, with ever-dropping manufacturing unit costs. Thus, the ultimate limits to growth of the industry will constrain the maximum amount of capital that can be invested in new products; at some point, Rock's Law will collide with Moore's Law.\n\nIt has been suggested that fabrication plant costs have not increased as quickly as predicted by Rock's law – indeed plateauing in the late 1990s – and also that the fabrication plant cost \"per transistor\" (which has shown a pronounced downward trend) may be more relevant as a constraint on Moore's Law.\n\n"}
{"id": "2271789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2271789", "title": "Naumkeag", "text": "Naumkeag\n\nNaumkeag is the former country estate of noted New York City lawyer Joseph Hodges Choate located at 5 Prospect Hill Road, Stockbridge, Massachusetts. The estate's centerpiece is a 44-room, Shingle Style country house designed principally by Stanford White of McKim, Mead & White, and constructed in 1886 and 1887.\n\nThe estate is noted for its large gardens, which were designed in the mid-20th century by noted landscape designer Fletcher Steele in conjunction with Choate's daughter Mabel. A National Historic Landmark District, Naumkeag is now owned by The Trustees of Reservations, who operate it as a nonprofit museum.\n\nNaumkeag was designed by architect Stanford White of McKim, Mead & White in 1885 as the summer estate for Joseph Hodges Choate (1832–1917), a prominent New York City attorney and American ambassador to England from 1899 to 1905, and then his daughter Mabel. The house is built in the Shingle Style with a wood-shingled exterior featuring brick and stone towers, prominent gables and large porch, and interiors with fine woodwork. It contains the Choate family's furniture, Chinese porcelain, and artwork collected from America, Europe, and the Far East.\n\nThe house sits within of terraced gardens (including The Rose Garden, The Afternoon Garden, and The Chinese Garden) and landscaped grounds surrounded by of woodland, meadow, and pasture. Its grounds were first designed in the late 1880s by Nathan Barrett, then replanned and expanded between 1926 and 1956 by the noted landscape designer Fletcher Steele. Barrett's original designs included two terraces, perennial beds (now the Chinese Garden), and an evergreen topiary. Steele's additions include the Afternoon Garden (1926); arguably his most famous design, the Blue Steps (1938); and the Chinese Garden (1936–1955).\n\nColonial settlement of the Prospect Hill section of Stockbridge began with the town's founding as a Native American mission community in the 1730s. The future site of Naumkeag was probably acquired by New York lawyer David Dudley Field in the 1870s, and purchased by Joseph Hodges Choate in 1884. Choate's family had vacationed in Stockbridge (where Choate's law partners also summered), and had picnicked on the property. Choate persuaded Field (whom he had opposed in the Boss Tweed legal cases) to part with on the south side of the hill.\n\nChoate was a longtime friend of architect Charles McKim, but most of the architectural design work was done by McKim's partner Stanford White. Although design work began shortly after the purchase, construction was delayed by the death of Choate's son. The house was completed in 1887 at a cost of about $35,000. White was also instrumental in providing the decorations and furnishings of the house, traveling to Europe with the Choates for the purpose.\n\nThe house underwent a variety of alterations and additions, some guided by architects George de Gersdorff and Charles Platt. The library was expanded in 1897, enclosing a space that had once served as a south-facing porch. The number of bathrooms was raised from four to seven in the early years of the 20th century. These changes, which included the addition of a porch to the master bedroom, necessitated the addition of a dormer on the third floor and a number of new windows. During the period of Mabel Choate's ownership only modest changes were made.\n\nJoseph Choate first offered the landscape design to Frederick Law Olmsted, but rejected his proposal to place the house halfway down the hill, where a favorite oak tree was located. The landscaping contract was instead given to Nathan Barrett, a self-taught designer then best known for his municipal work. Barrett's vision of the landscape was implemented between 1884 and 1894. His design included formal flower gardens near the house, and had a broad meadow slope down the hill, with an orchard and the family cemetery plot at the bottom. For the main fountain Choate commissioned White's friend and sculptor Frederick MacMonnies to produce a work; the result was \"Young Faun with Heron\".\nBetween 1895 and 1925 minor changes were made to the gardens under the guidance of Percival Gallagher and Marian Coffin. Design decisions in the later years were dominated by Choate's daughter Mabel, especially after Choate's death in 1917. Mabel acquired full control of the estate after her mother's death in 1929. Mabel Choate began her long and fruitful collaboration with designer Fletcher Steele in 1926. Upon her death in 1958 the estate was bequeathed to the Trustees of Reservations, to be \"an authentic representation of the times and manner of living which it now [1958] reflects.\"\n\nNaumkeag's main house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975; the listing was expanded and the entire estate was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 2007. Its designation was made for the architecture and content of the house, which are well-preserved examples of a Gilded Age country estate, and for the innovative landscape design work of Fletcher Steele.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The key feature of this model is positive assortative matching, whereby people with similar skill levels work together.\n\nThe name comes from the 1986 Challenger shuttle disaster, a catastrophe caused by the failure of a single O-ring.\n\nKremer thinks that the O-ring development theory explains why rich countries produce more complicated products, have larger firms and much higher worker productivity than poor countries.\n\nThere are five major assumptions of this model: firms are risk-neutral, labor markets are competitive, workers supply labor inelastically, workers are imperfect substitutes for one another, and there is a sufficient complementarity of tasks.\n\nProduction is broken down into \"n\" tasks. Laborers can use a multitude of techniques of varying efficiency to carry out these tasks depending on their skill. Skill is denoted by \"q\", where 0≤\"q\"≤1. The concept of \"q\" differs depending on interpretation. It could mean: the probability of a laborer successfully completing a task, the quality of task completion expressed as a percentage, or the quality of task completion with the condition of a margin of error that could reduce quality. Output is determined by multiplying the \"q\" values of each of the \"n\" tasks together and then multiplying this result by another term (lets say, \"B\") denoting the individual characteristics of the firm. \"B\" is positively correlated with the number of tasks. The production function here is simple:\n\nThe important implication of this production function is positive assortative matching. We can observe this through a hypothetical four-person economy with two low skill workers () and two high skill workers (). This equation dictates the productive efficiency of skill matching:\n\nBy this equation total product is maximized by pairing those with similar skill levels.\n\nThere are several implications one can derive from this model:\n\n\nThis model helps explain brain drain and international economic disparity. As Kremer puts it, \"If strategic complementarity is sufficiently strong, microeconomically identical nations or groups within nations could settle into equilibria with different levels of human capital\".\n\nGarett Jones (2013) builds upon Kremer's O-ring theory to explain why differences in worker skills are associated with \"massive\" differences in international productivity levels despite causing only modest differences in wages within a country. For this purpose, he distinguishes between O-ring jobs - jobs featuring high strategic complementarities in terms of skill - and foolproof jobs - jobs characterized by diminishing returns to labor - and assumes both production technologies to be available to all countries. He then goes on to show that small international variations in average worker skill per country result in both large international and small intra-national income inequality.\n"}

When Luna was assassinated in Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija, Román attempted to save him but he was also shot to death by Emilio Aguinaldo's presidential guards.\n\nFrancisco Román was born on October 4, 1869 in Alcala, Cagayan to Pelagia Velásquez, a Tagalog and José Román a Spanish national. Pelagia was the sister of Hilaria Velasquez, the mother of José and Rafael Palma. Paco's father, José, was a licensee of the tobacco monopoly system then implemented in the province. The family moved to Manila where the elder Román established a factory. Francisco then studied at Ateneo Municipal and eventually pursued studies in Hong Kong.\n\nRoman married Juliana Piqueras, whom he had two children, Juan and Carmen.\n\nFrancisco Román assumed his father's business after the latter died and secretly donated to the revolutionary cause. Being the son of a Spanish national, he sided with the colonial government and was believed to have volunteered in the Spanish cavalry in order to not be suspected of aiding the revolutionary forces. At the outbreak of the Philippine–American War, Roman joined General Antonio Luna's forces and rose to the ranks to become a colonel and Luna's aide-de-camp.\n\nRomán led what came to be known as the Second Battle of Caloocan where his forces were able to push the invading American forces back to Azcárraga Street in Manila.\n\nWhile setting up his mountain headquarters in Bayambang, Pangasinan, General Antonio Luna received a telegram on June 4, 1899 from Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija summoning him to a conference with the President Emilio Aguinaldo. Román, together with Captain Eduardo Rusca, Majors Manuel Bernal, José Bernal, and Simeon Villa, and 25 cavalrymen, joined Luna to Cabanatuan.\n\nThe next day, en route to Cabanatuan, a broken bridge posed to delay the entire party. Luna, accompanied by only Román and Rusca, decided to proceed immediately to the parish convent which was used as Aguinaldo's office after moving the government's capital from Malolos.\n\nAt around three in the afternoon, Luna, Román, and Rusca arrived at the convent of Cabanatuan, with Luna proceeding to meet Aguinaldo. Upon hearing gunshots Román proceeded to come to Luna's aid, but was assassinated himself by Aguinaldo's personal guards from Kawit, Cavite.\n\nRomán was buried together with Luna at the town cemetery with military honors.

{"id": "11104031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11104031", "title": "Rice Lofts", "text": "Rice Lofts\n\nThe Rice Lofts, formerly the Rice Hotel, is a historic building at 909 Texas Avenue in Downtown Houston, Texas, United States. The current building is the third to occupy the site. It was completed in 1913 on the site of the former Capitol building of the Republic of Texas, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The old Capitol building was operated as a hotel until it was torn down and replaced by a new hotel around 1881. Jesse H. Jones built a new seventeen-story, double-winged hotel in 1913, also called \"The Rice Hotel.\" This building underwent major expansions: adding a third wing in 1925, adding an eighteenth floor in 1951, and adding a five-story \"motor lobby in 1958. In addition, there were several renovations during its life as a hotel. It continued to operate as a hotel before finally shutting down in 1977. The Rice, renamed the Post Rice Lofts, was renovated and turned into apartments in 1998 after twenty-one years of standing unused.\n\nWhen Augustus Allen and John Kirby Allen commissioned the first survey of Houston in the fall of 1836, they made plans to set aside property for use by the Republic of Texas. Eventually they chose property on the south side of Texas Avenue between Travis and Main Street. They also agreed to construct a capitol building for the Texas government, and leased the building on easy terms.\n\nThe Republic of Texas used this as its capitol building from 1837 to 1839, and again from 1842 to 1845. In 1841, Mr. M. Norwood leased the building from Augustus Allen, and ran it as the Capitol Hotel. After the Texas government left Houston again, Augustus Allen resumed leasing the building to various hotel operators. Charlotte Allen sold the property to R.S. Blount in 1857. There were various hotel operators between 1857 and 1881 with a few name changes (Houston House and Barnes House). It is not clear how long Charlotte owned the property before it was sold in 1857. John Kirby Allen had died in 1838 without a will. After 1843, there was a dispute about his estate, which led to a permanent estrangement between Augustus and Charlotte Allen. Augustus left Houston in 1852. \n\nAnson Jones, the last president of the Republic of Texas, committed suicide at the hotel in 1858.\n\nAbraham Groesbeck razed the original building and constructed a five-story Victorian hotel in 1881. The building, then known as the \"Capitol Hotel\", was designed by George E. Dickey, and represented his first major commission since relocating to Houston in 1878. \n\nWilliam Marsh Rice bought the hotel after Groesbeck died in 1886. He added a three-story annex. Rice was murdered in 1900, and the hotel property was transferred to the Rice Institute, which he had established in 1891. The Rice Institute trustees renamed it the \"Rice Hotel\". \n\nJessie H. Jones, who would later redevelop the site, resided at the original Rice Hotel when he first arrived in Houston around 1898. Texas Governor James Hogg maintained a Houston residence there in 1904.\n\nThe hotel had been losing money and its taxes unpaid. Jesse H. Jones offered to lease the land from the Rice Institute and replace the existing hotel through his company, the Houston Hotel Association. Jones obtained a ninety-nine year lease with an option for a ninety-nine year extension. The Rice Institute also invested funds from its endowment to assist Jones in building a new hotel. After demolishing the original Rice Hotel in 1912, Jones hired Mauran, Russell & Crowell to design the new hotel. The new seventeen-story, C-shaped (or U-shaped) hotel opened in May 1913. The hotel featured four restaurants, a banquet room, a small concert hall, and a rooftop deck. The construction cost was about $3.5 million, .\n\nIn the first five years, the new Rice Hotel was losing money, but the Houston Hotel Association was able to repay its loans. Jesse Jones continued improving the building. In 1922, he installed air-conditioning in the Rice Hotel Cafeteria, the first for a public room in Houston. In 1924, he expanded the capacity of the cafeteria, but built over a basement pool (it would be discovered and re-opened in the 1998 renovation). In 1925, Jones hired Alfred C. Finn to design a new wing for the hotel, increasing the number of rooms to over 1,000 and creating the building's current E-shaped configuration. The Crystal Ballroom was air-conditioned in 1928, the same year that Houston hosted the National Democratic Convention. More than preparing the Rice Hotel for convention delegates, Jones lured the Democratic Convention to Houston in the first place, donating $200,000 to the cause, . A famous guest was during the convention was Franklin D. Roosevelt, the not yet Governor of New York. Jones placed a large shed on the hotel roof before the Democratic Convention to serve as temporary accommodations. This hotel deck was a popular dance venue during the 1930s. \n\nJones continued investing in the Rice Hotel through the 1930s. The Rice Barber Shop was remodeled in 1930, and a major remodeling of the bottom floors in 1938 coincided with a new, art-deco dining area, the Empire Room. He opened a barber shop in 1930, which remained in business there until about 1977. Five years later, he introduced air-conditioning to the Crystal ballroom, perhaps the first dance venue with such an amenity in Houston. In 1940, Jones embarked on another major remodeling, transforming the cafeteria into the Skyline Room, replete with plastic upholstery and fluorescent lighting. A first among Houston hotels, the Rice installed an escalator in 1946. By 1949, all the guest rooms were air-conditioned. In 1951, Jones hired Staub & Rather to transform the roof deck over the seventeenth floor into an eighteenth floor edition to house the Petroleum Club of Houston.\n\nAfter Jones died in 1956, the estate conveyed the Rice Hotel building to the Jones family non-profit, the Houston Endowment. The Rice continued to operate as a hotel under the management of the Houston Endowment until 1971. In 1957, Houston Endowment remodeled the Old Capital Club and the Flag Room from the previously existing Empire Room. They commissioned a five-story annex for a motor lobby and a second grand ballroom in 1958. The hotel featured fine dining in the Flag Room, a casual first-floor coffee shop, and the underground Rice Hotel Cafeteria, known for its signature dish, rice pudding. It had a variety of retail shops, including a lobby news stand, a hat store, and Bilton's Fine Jewelry. \n\nIn 1962 the Rice Hotel was used for a meeting of NASA Astronaut Group 2 - The New Nine - all of whom booked in with the code name \"Max Peck\" as portrayed on the 1998 HBO miniseries \"From the Earth to the Moon\".\n\nJohn F. Kennedy visited the Rice Hotel in 1962, and in 1963 before traveling to Fort Worth, and then Dallas, where he was assassinated. Kennedy used a suite at the Rice Hotel to hold meetings, which was supplied with caviar, champagne, and his favorite beer. After a brief visit at a LULAC event and his speech at the Albert Thomas Convention Center, he returned to his suite for a change of clothes. After less than six hours in Houston, he headed to the airport for his flight to Fort Worth. He also delivered his famous speech on religion in politics there to the Greater Houston Ministerial Conference on Sept. 12, 1960. Other notable people who have orated at the Rice are Texas Governor William P. Hobby and Captain James A. Baker of Baker and Botts. \n\nOther notable guests of the Rice Hotel include Groucho Marx and Liberace. Notable musicians who have performed at the Rice include Tommy Dorsey, Perry Como, Xavier Cugat, Woody Herman, Lawrence Welk, and a young Illinois Jacquet.\n\nRice University assumed ownership of the Rice Hotel through a donation from the Houston Endowment. The university had already owned the land since 1900, and the hotel had been operating under a ninety-nine year lease. The hotel ran profitably for a couple of years. However, Rice University estimated compliance to a new 1974 Houston fire code would cost as much as $1.2 million. In December 1974, the university warned that they might demolish the hotel if they could not sell it. Rittenhouse Capital Corporation purchased the property in 1975, and briefly operated as the Rice-Rittenhouse, opening in April 1976 after being closed for remodeling. The hotel closed again in August 1977.\n\nSeveral entities assumed financial interests in the Rice Hotel after the August 1977 closure. The Rice Preservation Corporation purchased the Rice Hotel property at auction in September 1977. Portfolio Management of Texas bought the property early in 1978 for $3 million, much more than the $542,962 paid at the 1977 foreclosure auction. The new owners secured a listing on the National Register of Historic Places and federal funding to convert the building into apartments. Portfolio Management of Texas did not raise enough capital and did not execute the federal grant. In 1981, Rovi Texas Corporation purchased the property for $7.75 million and announced they would operate it as a luxury hotel. The business plan was based on federal aid of $9.7 million, which was not forthcoming. Rovi Texas allowed its bank, Frankfurt BFG-Bank AG, to assume ownership of the property. The German Bank was asking $15 million to $17 million to sell until they discovered structural problems with the building, leading them to cut their asking price in half.\n\nRandall Davis inquired about redeveloping the Rice Hotel property in 1995. He had already rehabilitated old buildings and repurposed them as loft apartments. Three examples are the Dakota Lofts, the Hogg Palace, and the Tribeca Lofts.\nMichael Stevens, head of the Houston Housing Finance Corporation (HHFC), proposed a public-private partnership, which included $5 million in capital from the Randall Davis investment group with a $5 million matching funds from the City of Houston. However, as cost estimates for the renovation increased, private investors backed out. Stevens developed a tax increment financing (TIF) scheme in which the Rice project would borrow against future tax revenue increases. The City of Houston planned a Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone (TIRZ), placing the Rice within its boundaries. Based on projected tax revenue of $700,000, he coaxed a $6 million loan from Wells Fargo Bank, replacing the $5 million from the Davis group under the original plan. As head of HHFC, Stevens committed another $8 million to the project, $3 million of which would go toward buying the Rice outright. HHFC would recover its investment through selling federal tax credits for restoring historic buildings. \nStevens sold most of the municipal interest in the hotel to Columbus Properties for $4.5 million in cash. Columbus (later renamed Post Properties) also assumed all the municipal debt related to the project, but also gained the tax credits and the ground lease. The city retained ownership of the property, while Davis obtained a forty-year lease. \n\nDavis hired the architectural firm of Page Southerland Page to plan the renovation of the abandoned Rice Hotel. The firm presented Davis with a plan to limit public rooms to the ground floor. Alternatively, the Texas State Historical Association proposed restoring the Crystal Ballroom. Davis decided to model the public area after the 1913 Rice Hotel. This included restoration of the former two-story lobby, the Crystal Ballroom, and the Empire Room. The ground floor reserved 25,000-square feet of retail space, with a wide cast iron awning covering the sidewalks on the Texas Avenue side and part of the Main Street side.\n\nPost Properties (renamed from Columbus Properties) opened the Rice Lofts for tenants in April 1998. After renovation from 1000 hotel rooms into lofts, the building housed 312 apartments, including some 500-square foot efficiencies, many 1500-square foot apartments, and a few three-story penthouses. Efficiency apartments rented as low as $750 per month. \n\nSambuca, a jazz club, opened in ground floor space at the Rice on October 28, 1998. Sambuca, which was still operating at the same location as of November 19, 2014, announced plans to open a new bar \"Lawless\" on the second floor. \n\nIn early 2014, Post Properties listed the building for sale, while claiming an apartment occupancy rate of ninety-five percent and an average rental price of $1,700 per month. Later that year, CH Realty/MF Houston Rice VI (Crow Holding Capital Partners) acquired the building from Post Properties. \n\nIn 2014, Crow Holding Capital Partners announced plans to make renovations. The owners hired architectural firm Page to design the renovations. The plan includes installing appliances and remodeling each apartment, and moving a swimming pool and fitness center from the basement to the second floor. Along with new appliances for the apartments, there were plans for remodeling of each kitchen and bathroom. The management company also announced valet service would be offered to tenants. Early in 2014 Post Properties claimed that average rent was almost $1,700 per month and the building had a vacancy rate of about five percent. One person interviewed late in 2014 said his one-bedroom apartment rented for $1,550.\n\nThe Petroleum Club of Houston, founded in 1946, was originally located in the top area of the Rice Hotel. It moved to the ExxonMobil Building in 1963.\n\nThe Rice Lofts is zoned to the Houston Independent School District.\n\nResidents are zoned to Crockett Elementary School, Gregory Lincoln Education Center (for middle school), and Northside High School (formerly Davis High).\n\nBy Spring 2011 Atherton Elementary School and E.O. Smith Education Center were consolidated with a new K-5 campus in the Atherton site. As a result, the building was rezoned from Smith to Gregory Lincoln.\n\n\n"}

Lee Jr.\n\nRobert Edward \"Rob\" Lee Jr. (October 27, 1843 – October 19, 1914) was the youngest of three sons of Confederate General Robert E. Lee and Mary Anna Randolph Custis, and the sixth of their seven children. He became a soldier during the American Civil War, and later was a planter, businessman, and author.\n\nRob Lee was born and raised at Arlington House across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C. He was close to his father, who he was named after, and his sister, Mildred Lee. He attended boarding schools during much of the 1850s, while his father, a career U.S. Army officer, was serving in the Mexican–American War and as Superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Unlike his father and two older brothers, Rob apparently never envisioned a military career, never serving in the United States Army. In 1860, he enrolled at the University of Virginia.\n\nWhen the American Civil War broke out in 1861, his father and his two older brothers, Custis and Rooney, all chose to serve Virginia in the Confederate Army. To his mother's dismay, Rob joined them in 1862, enlisting in the Rockbridge Artillery as a private.\n\nAfter the Battle of Sharpsburg, he was promoted to the rank of Captain and assigned as aide to his older brother George Washington Custis Lee. The latter was a major general and aide-de-camp to the Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and involved in defending Richmond, Virginia.\nAll four Lees survived the Civil War. After the war, Rob lived and farmed Romancoke Plantation on the north bank of the Pamunkey River in King William County, which he inherited from his maternal grandfather George Washington Parke Custis. Romancoke was located approximately four miles from the Town of West Point.\n\nRob also became a writer, gathering his memories of his family and life in \"Recollections and Letters of General Robert E. Lee\" (1904). The first-hand account provides a valuable source of information on day-to-day life at Arlington House during his youth, and includes many items of interest regarding his father's entire life. (see link for online portion of this book below) However, some are now offended by racial views expressed therein.\n\nRobert E. Lee Jr. died in 1914. He was interred with his parents and siblings in the Lee Chapel in Lexington, Virginia, where his father and brother Custis each had served as a president of the college now known as Washington and Lee University.\n\nRob married twice. On November 16, 1871, he married Charlotte Haxall (October 23, 1848 – September 22, 1872). No children survived her.\n\nOn March 8, 1894, in Washington D.C., Rob Lee married Juliet Carter (April 6, 1860 – November 17, 1915), who was 16 years younger than him. They had two daughters, Anne Carter Lee (b. July 21, 1897) and Mary Custis Lee (b. December 23, 1900).\n\nRob's mother, Mary Anna Randolph Custis Lee, was the only surviving child of George Washington Parke Custis and Mary Lee Fitzhugh. George was the grandson of Martha Dandridge and adopted grandson (although not legally) of George Washington.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18743071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18743071", "title": "Submission management", "text": "Submission management\n\nThe art and science of collecting and managing submissions (of any kind) is called Submission Management. Traditionally, submissions were collected offline i.e. in the form of 'hard' paper files or folders. However, with the recent penetration of Internet in almost every sphere of life, there has been a steady shift towards collecting electronic submissions as compared to hard copies of submissions. The Internet has also facilitated a change in the perception towards the deliverables or contents of a submission. As a result of this, submitting audio and video files, pictures and presentations in addition to standard text, word and pdf-like documents has become common in the last few years.\n\nManaging submissions may include evaluating submissions and providing feedback to submitters, accepting or rejecting submissions or requesting submitters to make a re-submission. In some cases, a panel of experts may also be requested to assist in the evaluation of submissions by reviewing or judging them.\n\nIt is a common practice for teachers, professors and teaching assistants to get assignments and projects submitted by students, either electronically or otherwise. These assignments are graded and the students are given feedback on whatever they submitted and how can they improve it. In institutes where academic submissions are done electronically, there generally is a system (usually a web-based one) in place to assist in the collection and management of submissions.\n\nIn call-for-paper or academic conferences, prospective presenters are usually asked to submit a short abstract of their presentation or research work, which is reviewed before being accepted for the conference. Some conferences require researchers to submit a full paper of about 6–15 pages, which is peer reviewed by members of the conference's program committee and/or external reviewers chosen by them.\n\nMost competitions and contests held world over usually have an initial screening round in which they accept nominations or entries from prospective participants. After all the nominations and entries have been received, the organizers of the competition or contest evaluate and shortlist the required number of entries on the basis of certain parameters set by them, notify the participants whose entries have been shortlisted and invite them to participate in further rounds of the competition or contest. Those whose entries were not shortlisted may also be given feedback by the organizers with a reason for the rejection and tips for improvement.\n\nStudent bodies in colleges and universities usually organize various inter-college and intra-college events and fests on an annual and/or semester basis. These events and fests are usually made up of several big and small competitions and contests, each of which generally follow a procedure as explained in the paragraph above.\n\nRegulatory submissions in the pharmaceutical–biotechnology and medical device industry comprise documents and data that are submitted to a regulatory agency to gain approval to market new drugs, biologics and devices but also when modifications are introduced in registered data (variations). The documentation represents years of research and includes multi-disciplinary information (including preclinical and clinical data) regarding the safety and efficacy of a compound. The regulatory process varies from country to country and involves numerous interactions between the submitting company (sponsor) and the regulatory authority (agency). Many regulatory agencies accept electronic submissions in conjunction with or in lieu of submitting paper.\n\nHuman resource departments collect résumés and CVs as a part of processing job applications. Applicants submit their résumés either via email, on the website of their prospective employer or on employment websites that help connect job seekers and employers.\n\nIn contemporary art, curators often select and interpret works of art created by various artists. Before the popularity of the Internet, this was often done in person but these days some curators prefer artists submitting pictures of their work over email or by other electronic means for an initial screening. If the curator likes a particular work of art, he may electronically communicate his desire to work with the artist after verifying that the picture is indeed of his work.\n\nModels create and maintain portfolios which they use to showcase themselves during the process of getting selected for various fashion shows, advertisements and other events in the fashion industry. Those who are responsible for taking a decision on which models to choose usually ask prospective models to submit their portfolios with them. They take their decision after evaluating all the portfolios available with them.\n\nJournalists and writers (full-time as well as freelancers) usually submit their articles and reports to editors of magazines, journals, newspapers and news channels who then select which ones will be published and/or telecasted and which ones won't be. At times, editors even provide feedback to the authors of reports with an intention of seeking pre-publication improvement.\n\nMost government procedures demand the filling up of a form, either electronically or on paper. Citizens submit their forms to the desired government agency by their preferred mode of communication after which the agency performs an initial verification during which they may contact the concerned person for further information, data or correction of errors. After the verification stage, the forms are marked for processing and the concerned person is intimated once the processing is over. The processing stage may involve external or sister agencies too.\n\nAs companies, agencies and institutes move towards electronic submissions, a lot of complexity has been added in the submission management domain. In the paper world, much of the effort of managing a submission involves printing and collating volumes of information but with electronic submissions, it becomes increasingly difficult to efficiently manage the tens and thousands of submissions coming from different sources, in different formats at different times. As a result, many agencies are in the process of trying to implement global standards for submission formats and standards.\n\nOne example of this is the standards put forth by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) in the context of the pharmaceuticals industry. The ICH has developed the electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) to promote harmonization of regulatory submissions in electronic format across various regions (United States, Europe and Japan).\n\nEmail is by-far the most popular mode for collecting and managing electronic submissions and post for paper submissions. Since, both these processes are manual to quite an extent, they often lead to delays, inconsistencies and mishaps. In some setups, there are tailor-made systems that help collectors of submissions to some extent but they often fail owing to their ultra specific nature.\n\nThe key to successful submission management involves tracking each submission as well as all its versions and sub-parts that may be related to it or dependent on it. In addition to planning and tracking submission content, it is also important to manage and allocate resources effectively based on workload, skill sets and availability. Submission collectors may seek the help of expert reviewers or judges in such cases. All these reasons have motivated many companies and researchers to begin looking at submission management as a formal discipline and to start analyzing metrics behind various submission processes.\n\nCertain software vendors have begun developing submission management systems to assist submission collectors in the automation, tracking and management of complex submission processes. Most of these systems are web based and accessible from any device with a browser and an Internet connection. However, a majority of these systems are application specific and cannot be applied to all submission management scenarios. This means that a lot of work needs to be done in this field before we have good and reliable submission management systems that are suitable and usable in every context of submission management.\n"}

In 1983, he proposed a definition for \"corporate purpose:\" Rather than merely making money, it is to create and keep a customer.\n\nLevitt was born in 1925 in Vollmerz to a Jewish family. A decade later his family moved to Dayton, Ohio. He served in World War II, received his high school diploma through correspondence school and then earned a bachelor's at Antioch College and a Ph.D. in economics at Ohio State University. His first teaching job was at the University of North Dakota.\n\nIn 1959 he joined the faculty of the Harvard Business School. Later that year, he became world-renowned after publishing \"Marketing Myopia\" in Harvard Business Review where he asks \"What business are you in?\", a phrase that demands one account for the significance of the job one does.\n\nThough widely credited with coining the term globalization in an article entitled \"Globalization of Markets\", which appeared in the May–June 1983 issue of Harvard Business Review, he was not the originator of the term. As a NYTimes article notes, the term 'globalization' was in use well before this publication (at least as early as 1944) and had been used by economists as early as 1981. Nonethless, Levitt can be credited with popularizing the term and bringing to a mainstream business audience. \n\nBetween 1985 and 1989, he headed the \"Harvard Business Review\" as an editor.\n\nHe was the author of \"The Marketing Imagination\", and was a best-selling author whose works have been translated into eleven languages. He was also the author of numerous articles on economic, political, management, and marketing subjects.\n\nHe was a four-time winner of the McKinsey Awards competitions for best annual article in the \"Harvard Business Review\"; winner of Academy of Management Award for the outstanding business books of 1962 for \"Innovation in Marketing\"; winner of John Hancock Award for Excellence in Business Journalism in 1969; recipient of the Charles Coolidge Parlin Award as \"Marketing Man of the Year,\" 1970; recipient of the George Gallup Award for Marketing Excellence, 1976; recipient of the 1978 Paul D.
