He was the leader of an alliance of Iraqi Sunni Arab tribes that opposed al-Qaeda in Iraq.\n\nAbu Risha was assassinated shortly after becoming an ally of the Iraqi government through forming an organisation of fellow tribal chiefs called the \"Sahawat al-Anbar\" (Anbar Awakening), based in Anbar's provincial capital of Ramadi, some west of Baghdad.\n\nAbu Risha was the grandson of a tribal leader in the Iraqi revolt against the British occupying forces in 1920 and the son of a commander in the Anglo-Iraqi War in 1941. Little is known about Abu Risha's life prior to the Iraq War, albeit he reportedly ran a construction and import-export business with offices in Amman in Jordan and Dubai in the UAE. According to \"The Washington Post\", \"he was called a warlord and a highway bandit, an oil smuggler and an opportunist\". Many of the Awakening leaders are believed to have at least tacitly supported the Iraqi insurgency, though Sattar claimed he never did.\n\nDuring the early part of the insurgency following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, as al-Qaeda's fighters tightened their grip on Ramadi, it is reported that they became increasingly repressive and challenged the tribal leaders' power. Soon they were kidnapping and beheading tribal Sunnis as part of a campaign of extortion and intimidation. Abdul Sattar's own father and two brothers were killed by al-Qaeda. During the late summer of 2006, he began enlisting his fellow sheikhs in \"Sahawat al-Anbar\" and encouraging members of his tribe to join the local police force. The U.S. forces under Lt. Col. Tony Deane encouraged Sattar and provided security for the initial meetings of the Al Anbar tribal meetings at Sattar's compound in western Ramadi; these early meetings were the beginning of what grew into the Anbar Salvation Council by the fall of 2006; in March 2007 the Council counted 41 clans from Anbar province. The development led to a sharp reduction of violence in the province and forced many al-Qaeda fighters to flee to other regions of Iraq.\n\nAbu Risha was assassinated on September 13, 2007, along with three of his guards by an improvised explosive device planted on the road near the gate of his house in Ramadi. Al-Qaeda took responsibility for the attack and several dozen people were arrested in connection with the killing, including the head of his own security detail.\n\nThe sheikh's funeral attracted about 1,500 mourners, including Iraq's national security adviser Mowaffak al-Rubaie, Interior Minister Jawad Jawad Bulani, Defense Minister General Qadir Obeidi and Lieutenant-General Raymond Odierno, second in command of U.S. forces in Iraq, and sparked vows of revenge. After Abu Risha's death, his brother, Sheik Ahmed Abu Risha, was selected to take over leadership of the Anbar Salvation Council by the tribal leaders of the province.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38994057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38994057", "title": "Allan Staffans", "text": "Allan Staffans\n\nAllan Walfrid Staffans (13 February 1880 – 19 October 1946) was a Finnish technician, vuorineuvos and shipbuilder.\n\nStaffans began his career at Maskin- och Brobyggnad (Maskin o. Bro) shipyard in Helsinki in 1898. Later he worked in shipbuilding industry in Siberia until World War I, when he returned to Finland. In 1918 he led an operation for eliminating of cannons in Viapori fortress in Helsinki; the significance of the event has been later disputed by historians.\n\nIn 1920 Staffans was selected the manager of Vulcan shipyard in Turku. He organised a merger with its competitor Crichton creating Crichton-Vulcan shipyard, which grew under his leadership the most significant shipbuilding company of Finland. The yard built the most important vessels of the Finnish Navy, including submarines and two large coastal defence ships.\n\nAfter World War II Staffans participated in negotiations of war reparations to Soviet Union.\n\nStaffans had two daughters with his wife Selma Elisabeth née Kjellin.\n\nStaffans was born in Nikolaistad, Grand Duchy of Finland, for sailor Matts Staffans and Amanda Maria Sofia née Törner. He first learned at folkschool and then graduated technician in mechanical engineering in Nikolaistad Industry School in 1898. By end of the 19th century the Nikolaistad shipbuilding industry, which once was a flourishing branch in the area, was almost disappeared. Staffans moved to Helsinki where he got a position at Maskin o. Bro shipyard. Staffans soon reached master's level in shipbuilding.\n\nIn 1902 he was sent to work in Siberia to lead steam ship and dredging vessel building from materials transported from Finland. The parts were taken by rail to river Amur delta and then built in place. The primary customer was the Imperial Russian Navy, which joined the vessels to its Pacific fleet to mainly protect the traffic of the large rivers. Staffans travelled to far east total six times, some of the journeys he did with his family. The last journey Staffans did through Suez Canal and Indian Ocean, and he also stopped by in India, China and Japan. Staffans planned to leave for few years to study in Germany and UK in 1914 but outbreak of World War I changed his plans.\n\nAfter Finland declared independence the Finnish Civil War broke out in January 1918 and Helsinki was soon taken over by the Finnish Red Guards. The Viapori fortress in front of Helsinki was still housed by the Russian soldiers and its cannons were seen as a threat against the Finnish White Guards.\n\nAllan Staffans went to the fortress with some twenty men to dismount the locks of the cannons. The work started from the outer bastions and the main fortress followed after. The locks weighed hundreds of kilos were dismounted by use of winch hoists, packed into wooden caskets and stored in the warehouses of the batteries. The men moved on ice by feet and pulling the equipment on a sledge. The work was dangerous due to patrolling red guards, who reached over the cannons for their own use. The Russian soldiers were not always willing to accept the disarmament, but the good relationship Staffans had built with the Russian military during his work in Maskin o. Bro helped, although time to time the discussions were heated. The work was done by 15 March.\n\nThe White Guards got help from the German army which invaded in southern Finland in beginning of April. The Russian military handed Viapori over to the Finns on 14 April.\n\nAfter the war the newspaper Hufvudstadsbladet published an article, according which Staffans had duped the Russian military personnel by typing himself an attorney letter fooling the fortress organisation up to the highest command. The operation was described as a \"historic deed\". As a memory of the event, there is a bust of Staffans in the fortress.\n\nHowever, the Russian commander of artillery in Viapori colonel Balzam wrote a reply to a Russian speaking newspaper in Helsinki, that the operation was done under order of the commandant of the fortress and the directive of the Russian navy headquarters to ensure that none of the fighting parties would use the artillery against the city, and Staffans and his men were paid for their work by the Russian military.\n\nRussia and Germany had agreed in the Brest-Litovsk peace treaty that the Russian Baltic fleet and coast fortresses would not get involved in military operations in Finland. It also came out afterwards that the Russian soldiers were not very interested in the mutual skirmishes of Finns. More information about the disputed event has been recently found from a 26 March 1918 dated report written by Oskar Gros who was a member in Staffans's team. The report tells that the work was done under supervision of Staffans and also consent with the Russian officers, who wanted to avoid that operative cannons had ended up to the hands of the Red Guards or German troops.\n\nIt is speculated, that a possible motive for exaggeration of the action was the Finnish White Guards' crave to get a part of the glory Helsinki conquest, which was mainly done by Germans.\n\nAfter the war ended Staffans stayed serving the Finnish army in the fortress during years 1918–1920 under commandant office as the technical manager of the dry dock.\n\nStaffans was appointed general manager of Vulcan shipyard in Turku at the beginning of 1921. The company had got into financial trouble as the orders from the Russian navy had ceased, some of the deliveries had not been paid and the company had lost its property in Saint Petersburg. The company made heavy losses. Staffans was selected manager because of his experience, high expertise and leadership skills.\n\nIn 1922 Staffans negotiated with the state about repairing of an old Russian submarine. As the company had no experience about submarines, Staffans searched for contacts which had the technology. Although the project turned out to be hopeless, Staffans managed to get to know the Dutch company IvS, which was eager to start a submarine project with Vulcan. IvS was a German dummy company set up to maintain and develop the German submarine engineering expertise, when it was not allowed for Germany to build its own submarines. During 1922–1923 Staffans attended in committees which were planning an updated naval defence strategy for Finland. Vulcan and IvS signed a secret contract about co-operation for submarine engineering in November 1923. According to the contract, IvS promised to give all the needed engineering support in case Vulcan wants to build submarines. In the following month Staffans negotiated about a merger with a competitor, Crichton yard, which was located next to Vulcan, at the other side of the river Aura.\n\nThe merger of Crichton and Vulcan took place on 18 August 1924 and Staffans was chosen unanimously to lead the new, united Crichton-Vulcan yard. The yard got only few orders and Staffans put his hope on getting orders from the Finnish Navy. The naval defence strategy was ready in 1925 and included four submarines, two coastal defence ships and four torpedo boats. The ministry of defence sent inquiries for 22 companies for 400-ton and 100-ton submarines. Finally, Staffans's efforts were rewarded, when the state ordered first in 1926 one and then in 1927 two more 400-ton submarines from Crichton-Vulcan. Another order for a 100-ton submarine went to Hietalahti shipyard in Helsinki. The project schedules were delayed by months due to strikes in 1927. The submarines Vetehinen, Vesihiisi and Iku-Turso were launched between June 1930 and May 1931. IvS and Crichton-Vulcan made a secret agreement about one more submarine, CV-707, which Germans used for testing. The vessel stayed finally in the Finnish navy and was named Vesikko.\n\nSimultaneously with the submarine projects, the yard worked already on two 3 800 ton coastal defence ship projects. Crichton-Vulcan signed contracts for the ships in November 1928. Building of such large and demanding ships required investments in facilities and cranes; also the number of employees was increased. The first one of the ships, Väinämöinen, was launched in December 1930 and Ilmarinen followed in July 1931.\n\nThe investments required capital and finally Crichton-Vulcan was sold to Maskin o. Bro, which had taken over previously the Hietalahti yard in Helsinki. The acquisition improved the company's financial basis and during the 1930s Crichton-Vulcan had grown the strongest and most modern shipyard of Finland under Staffans's leadership. The most important investments were a crane with a capacity of 100 tonnes and a dry dock.\n\nDuring the 1930s Crichton-Vulcan managed to sell ships to Soviet Union. Staffans's excellent Russian language skills proved helpful in the negotiations. Contracts for total 29 ships to Soviet Union were signed; the orders were vital in the middle of the depression.\n\nThe company got again a new owner when Wärtsilä took over Maskin o. Bro, including Crichton-Vulcan. The General Manager Wilhelm Wahlforss trusted and respected Staffans; in fact, Staffans was one of those few people who could disagree and argue openly with Wahlforss without being afraid of consequences. Wahlforss did not question his authority in Crichton-Vulcan and Staffans could continue his investment program.\n\nCrichton-Vulcan got more demanding orders at the end of the 1930s; a big step was 2 000-dwt steam ship \"Rigel\" made for FÅA. This was followed by more modern and challenging projects; total 17 ships were ordered between January 1936 and September 1939. Staffans's right hand was the company's chief engineer Gösta Rusko, who was also his son-in-law.\n\nThe biggest investments of the late 1930s were the new office building \"White House\", foundry and large machine workshops. The latter ones were built especially for diesel engine production. By using his old contacts from ivS, Staffans made a licence production agreement with Krupp Germaniawerft AG in summer 1938. The engine production could be started only in summer 1941, when all the needed machines were in place, and finally just two Krupp engines were built. These were the first diesel engines of Wärtsilä.\n\nWhen Winter War broke out in 1939, Turku was heavily bombed by the Soviet air forces, but Crichton-Vulcan avoided of large damages. When the peace came in 1940, Finland signed a new trading agreement with Soviet Union and soon Staffans and the Soviet Machinoimport signed a contract of four tug boats; this was followed by another order of 12 more slightly larger vessels of the same kind. No single vessel could be delivered before Finland was again in war with Soviet Union in summer 1941. However, Staffans found a new customer: he agreed delivering of the ships to German Kriegsmarine instead, and the yard got even few more orders for similar ships from Germany. In addition, Staffans signed contracts for cargo ships for Germany. Total 38 vessels were handed over to Germany before Finland got at war with Germany in September 1944. The yard suffered some damages in the Continual War.\n\nAfter the war ended, Finland had to pay heavy war reparations to Soviet Union, which wanted the payment mainly in machinery. The largest and most demanding ships were assigned to Wärtsilä yards. Staffans was called together with Wahlforss and the Hietalahti yard manager August Jansson to negotiate about the ship types. Once again, Staffans's excellent knowledge about Russian language and Russian mentality proved helpful. The agreement about material list was signed in December 1944 by Andrei Zhdanov from the Allied Commission and the prime minister of Finland, J.K. Paasikivi.\n\nStaffans was not involved into the war reparation industry as he fell ill and died in 1946. During his period the number of personnel at Crichton-Vulcan yard had grown from 300 up to 3 000.\n\nIn 1904 Staffans married Selma Elisabeth née Kjellin, who was from Helsinki. They got two daughters: Margit and Gunvor. Margit married later Gösta Rusko, the main engineer of Crichton-Vulcan. The younger daughter Gunvor was married to professor John Rosas.\n\nStaffans was a vice consul for Netherlands in the 1930s.\n\nIn 1942 Staffans wrote a book called \"Skeppsbyggare och resenär i Östasien\" about his experiences in Siberia in the early 20th century.\n\nStaffans faced two major personal losses in 1943 when first his closest colleague and son-in-law Gösta Rusko became seriously ill and perished in April. The widow and Staffans's daughter Margit Rusko died only two months later. Staffans and his wife took care of their two children after.\n\nThe family moved permanently in Turku in the early 1920s, but they also had a summer villa in Kirkkonummi. The villa had to be given to Soviet Union after the Continual War as a part of Porkkala lease area. When Soviet Union returned the area back to Finland in 1956, the widow Selma Staffans moved in, and despite of her high age, she participated eagerly into rebuilding of the area.\n\n\n"}

Through his father Frederick, Bradlee was also a lineal descendant of King Henry VII of England by an unknown British woman through their son Sir Roland de Velville. His maternal great-grandfather was Dr. Ernst Bruno von Gersdorff, who was a third cousin of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom through Heinrich XXIX.\n\nBradlee, the second of three children, grew up in a wealthy family with domestic staff. With his brother, Freddy, and sister, Constance, he learned French, took piano lessons, and went to the symphony and the opera. The stock market crash of 1929 decimated the family's wealth however. During the Clutch Plague, Bradlee's father worked odd jobs to support his family, including keeping the books for various clubs and institutions and supervising the janitors at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.\n\nBradlee attended Dexter School before finishing at St. Mark's School, where he played varsity baseball. While attending St. Mark's, he contracted polio. He exercised regularly at home and developed strong arms and chest. He was able to fight off the effects of polio and could walk without limping. Thereafter he attended Harvard College, where he was a member of the A.D. Club, a Greek–English major and joined the Naval ROTC.\n\nBradlee received his naval commission two hours after graduating in 1942, joined the Office of Naval Intelligence, and worked as a communications officer in the Pacific during World War II. His duties included handling classified and coded cables, serving primarily on the destroyer USS \"Philip\" fighting off the shore of Guam and arriving at Guadalcanal with the Second Transport Group, part of Task Group 62.4, commanded by Rear Admiral Norman Scott. Bradlee's main battles were Vella Lavella, Saipan, Tinian, and Bougainville. He also fought in the biggest naval battle ever fought, the Battle of Leyte Gulf in the Philippines Campaign, in the Borneo Campaign, and made every landing in the Solomon Islands campaign.\n\nBradlee's first marriage was to Jean Saltonstall, who also came from a wealthy and prominent Boston Brahmin family. They married on , 1942, and had one son, Ben Bradlee Jr., who became a deputy managing editor of \"The Boston Globe\".\n\nAfter the war, in 1946, Bradlee became a reporter at the \"New Hampshire Sunday News\", a venture he helped launch. After he sold the paper, in 1948 he started working for \"The Washington Post\" as a reporter. He got to know associate publisher Philip Graham, who was the son-in-law of the publisher, Eugene Meyer. On , 1950, Bradlee was alighting from a streetcar in front of the White House just as two Puerto Rican nationalists attempted to shoot their way into Blair House in an attempt to kill President Harry S. Truman. In 1951 Graham helped Bradlee become assistant press attaché in the American embassy in Paris \n\nIn 1952, Bradlee joined the staff of the Office of U.S. Information and Educational Exchange (USIE), the embassy's propaganda unit. USIE produced films, magazines, research, speeches, and news items for use by the CIA throughout Europe. USIE (later known as USIA) also controlled the Voice of America, a means of disseminating pro-American \"cultural information\" worldwide. While at the USIE, according to a Justice Department memo from an assistant U.S. attorney in the Rosenberg Trial, Bradlee was helping the CIA manage European propaganda regarding the spying conviction and execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg on , 1953. The memo, addressed to U.S. Attorney Myles Lane and dated December 13, 1952, states that \"[Mr. Bradlee] further advised that he was sent here by Robert Thayer, who is the head of the CIA in Paris ... he stated that he was supposed to have been met by a representative of the CIA at the airport but missed connections\" and that \"he has been trying to get in touch with [CIA Director] Allen Dulles.\" \n\nThis memorandum was cited as evidence of Bradlee's CIA connections by author Deborah Davis in her 1979 biography of Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham, \"Katharine the Great: Katharine Graham and her Washington Post Empire\". Graham and Bradlee, in a controversial action that drew widespread accusations of censorship, demanded and obtained the recall of the book by Davis's publisher, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, which first disavowed the book, and then recalled and shredded 20,000 copies. Davis subsequently won a judgment against her publisher, however, and the Justice Department memorandum that formed the primary basis for her claims regarding Bradlee's CIA affiliation was never disavowed, even by Bradlee himself. It appeared in two subsequent editions of Davis's book without challenge and was cited by author Carol Felsenthal, in her 1999 book \"Power, Privilege, and The Post: The Katharine Graham Story\". Reporter Christopher Reed, in his obituary on Bradlee in \"The Guardian\", states that Bradlee \"spent many years undercover as a counter-espionage informant, a government propagandist and an unofficial asset of the Central Intelligence Agency,\" initially by promulgating \"CIA-directed European propaganda urging the controversial execution of the convicted American spies Ethel and Julius Rosenberg.\"\n\nBradlee was officially employed by USIE until 1953, and he began working for \"Newsweek\" in 1954. While based in France, Bradlee divorced his first wife and married Antoinette Pinchot in 1957. At the time of the marriage, Antoinette's sister, Mary Pinchot Meyer, was married to Cord Meyer, a key figure in Operation Mockingbird, a CIA program to influence the media. Antoinette Bradlee was also a close friend of Cicely d'Autremont, who was married to CIA counterintelligence chief James Jesus Angleton. Bradlee became friends with Angleton but the two allegedly parted ways after the October 12, 1964, murder of Bradlee's sister-in-law Mary Pinchot Meyer, whose CIA connections and romantic ties to the late President John F. Kennedy made her death the object of intense scrutiny. Bradlee and Angleton gave conflicting accounts of the events surrounding the search for and disposition of the diary in which Pinchot Meyer recorded her affair with Kennedy.\n\nIn 1957, while working as a reporter for \"Newsweek\", Bradlee created controversy when he interviewed members of the FLN. They were Algerian guerrillas who were in rebellion against the French government at the time.\nAccording to Deborah Davis, author of the Katharine Graham biography \"Katharine the Great\", this had all the \"earmarks of an intelligence operation\". As a result of these interviews, Bradlee was forced to leave France.\n\nAs a reporter in the 1950s, Bradlee became close friends with then-senator John F. Kennedy, who had graduated from Harvard two years before Bradlee, and lived nearby. In 1960 Bradlee toured with both Kennedy and Richard Nixon in their presidential campaigns. He later wrote a book, \"Conversations With Kennedy\" (W.W. Norton, 1975), recounting their relationship during those years. Bradlee was, at this point, Washington Bureau chief for \"Newsweek\", a position from which he helped negotiate the sale of the magazine to \"The Washington Post\" holding company. Bradlee maintained that position until being promoted to managing editor at the \"Post\" in 1965. He became executive editor in 1968.\n\nAfter Bradlee and Pinchot divorced, Bradlee married fellow journalist Sally Quinn on , 1978. Quinn and Bradlee had one child, Quinn Bradlee, who was born in 1982 when Quinn was 40 and Bradlee was 60. In 2009 they appeared with Quinn Bradlee on the \"Charlie Rose Show\" on PBS and spoke of their son's having been born with Velo-cardio-facial syndrome, also known as DiGeorge syndrome.\n\nBradlee retired as the executive editor of \"The Washington Post\" in September 1991 but continued to serve as vice president at large until his death. He was succeeded as executive editor at the \"Post\" by Leonard Downie Jr., whom Bradlee had appointed as managing editor seven years earlier.\n\nUnder Bradlee's leadership, \"The Washington Post\" took on major challenges during the Nixon administration. In 1971 \"The New York Times\" and the \"Post\" successfully challenged the government over the right to publish the Pentagon Papers. One year later, Bradlee backed reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as they probed the break-in at the Democratic National Committee Headquarters in the Watergate Hotel. According to Bradlee:\n\nYou had a lot of Cuban or Spanish-speaking guys in masks and rubber gloves, with walkie-talkies, arrested in the Democratic National Committee Headquarters at 2 in the morning. What the hell were they in there for? What were they doing? The follow-up story was based primarily on their arraignment in court, and it was based on information given our police reporter, Al Lewis, by the cops, showing them an address book that one of the burglars had in his pocket, and in the address book was the name 'Hunt,' H-u-n-t, and the phone number was the White House phone number, which Al Lewis and every reporter worth his salt knew. And when, the next day, Woodward—this is probably Sunday or maybe Monday, because the burglary was Saturday morning early—called the number and asked to speak to Mr. Hunt, and the operator said, 'Well, he's not here now; he's over at' such-and-such a place, gave him another number, and Woodward called him up, and Hunt answered the phone, and Woodward said, 'We want to know why your name was in the address book of the Watergate burglars.' And there is this long, deathly hush, and Hunt said, 'Oh my God!' and hung up. So you had the White House. You have Hunt saying 'Oh my God!' At a later arraignment, one of the guys whispered to a judge. The judge said, 'What do you do?' and Woodward overheard the words 'CIA.' So if your interest isn't whetted by this time, you're not a journalist.\n\nEnsuing investigations of suspected cover-ups led inexorably to congressional committees, conflicting testimonies, and ultimately to the resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974. For decades, Bradlee was one of only four publicly known people who knew the true identity of press informant Deep Throat, the other three being Woodward, Bernstein, and Deep Throat himself, who later revealed himself to be Nixon's FBI associate director Mark Felt.\n\nIn 1981 \"Post\" reporter Janet Cooke won a Pulitzer Prize for \"Jimmy's World\", a profile of an 8-year-old heroin addict. Cooke's article turned out to be fiction: there was no such addict. As executive editor, Bradlee was roundly criticized in many circles for failing to ensure the article's accuracy. After questions about the story's veracity arose, Bradlee (along with publisher Donald Graham) ordered a \"full disclosure\" investigation to ascertain the truth. Bradlee personally apologized to Mayor Marion Barry and the chief of police of Washington, D.C., for the \"Post\"'s fictitious article. Cooke, meanwhile, was forced to resign and relinquish the Pulitzer.\n\nIn recognition of his work as editor of \"The Washington Post\", Bradlee won the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism in 1998.\n\nBradlee published an autobiography in 1995, \"A Good Life: Newspapering and Other Adventures\". He had an acting role in \"Born Yesterday\", the 1993 remake of the 1950 romantic comedy. In 1983 he gave the inaugural Vance Distinguished Lecture at Central Connecticut State University. On , 2006, Bradlee received a Doctor of Humane Letters from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. Prior to receiving the honorary degree, he taught occasional journalism courses at Georgetown.\n\nIn 1991 he was persuaded by then–governor of Maryland William Donald Schaefer to accept the chairmanship of the Historic St. Mary's City Commission and continued in that position through 2003. He also served for many years as a member of the board of trustees at St. Mary's College of Maryland, and endowed the Benjamin C. Bradlee Annual Lecture in Journalism there. He continued to serve as vice chairman of the school's board of trustees.\n\nIn 1991, Bradlee delivered the Theodore H. White lecture at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. His message: Lying in Washington, whether in the White House or the Congress, is wrong, immoral, tearing at the fiber of our national instincts and institutions — and must stop. He said, \"Lying has reached such epidemic proportions in our culture and among our institutions in recent years, that we've all become immunized to it.\" He went on to suggest that the deceit was degrading the respect for the truth.\n\nIn the fall of 2005, Jim Lehrer conducted six hours of interviews with Bradlee on a variety of topics, from the responsibilities of the press to Watergate to the Valerie Plame affair. The interviews were edited for an hour-long documentary, \"Free Speech: Jim Lehrer and Ben Bradlee\", which premiered on PBS on , 2006.\n\nAt \"The Washington Post\", Bradlee carried the title vice president at large. He and Quinn lived at the Todd Lincoln House in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. The middle part of the house was built in 1792. They also restored Porto Bello, their home in Drayden, Maryland.\n\nBradlee received the French Legion of Honor, the highest award given by the French government, at a ceremony in 2007 in Paris.\n\nBradlee was named as a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama on , 2013, and was presented the medal at a White House ceremony on , 2013.\n\nBradlee spent his final years suffering with dementia. In late September 2014, he entered hospice care due to declining health as a result of Alzheimer's disease. He died of natural causes on , 2014, at his home in Washington, D.C., at the age of 93. His funeral was held at the Washington National Cathedral on October 29. He was buried at the Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C. \"The Daily Beast\" paid tribute to Bradlee by posting his quote, \"Today Our Best, Tomorrow Better\" on the wall of their office.\n\nBradlee has drawn criticism from several quarters for his perjury at the 1965 trial of the man accused of murdering Bradlee's sister-in-law Mary Pinchot Meyer, who was shot to death on October 12, 1964, while walking on the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal towpath in Georgetown. Attorneys for both the prosecution and the defense (Alfred Hantman and Dovey J. Roundtree), in addition to D.C. Police Detective Bernie Crooke, along with authors Peter Janney and Nina Burleigh, have all noted the significant difference between the limited information Bradlee divulged under oath at the 1965 trial, and what he revealed 30 years later in his 1995 memoir \"A Good Life\".\n\nPinchot Meyer biographers Janney and Burleigh have both criticized Bradlee's omission of substantial information under oath. \"Bradlee had excoriated Cord Meyer [Pinchot Meyer's ex-husband] for his 'derisive scorn' for the people's right to know in the 1960s, but the rules changed when the subject of a story was his sister-in-law,\" author Burleigh wrote. \"The First Amendment champion of the Watergate investigation admitted in his memoir that he gave Mary Meyer's diary to the CIA because it was 'a family document.'\"\n\nIn his 1995 memoir \"A Good Life\", Bradlee revealed that his sister-in-law's diary contained information about her affair with the late President Kennedy and the fact that Bradlee had conspired with CIA counterintelligence chief James Angleton and others to destroy it. At the 1965 trial, however, he failed to mention the diary when asked under oath what he had found when searching her studio on the night of the murder.\n\nIn a 1991 interview with the late author Leo Damore, prosecuting attorney Hantman said that having knowledge of the diary at the trial \"could have changed everything.\" In her 2009 autobiography, \"Justice Older than the Law\", defense counsel Dovey Johnson Roundtree expresses shock at learning of the diary's significance from Bradlee's book, and states,\n\nJames Angleton's awareness of the diary's existence and his interest in finding it, reading it, and destroying it – all of that unsettled me deeply when I read Mr. Bradlee's 1995 account, as did his insistence that the diary was a private document ... Had I been aware of it, I would have felt compelled to pursue it.\n\nFor many years Bradlee served on the board of trustees of St. Mary's College of Maryland. He was very active on the board and also played major roles in the establishment of the Center for the Study of Democracy at the college, where he also served on the advisory board.\n\nHe is also known for his work on the board of trustees of the Historic St. Mary's City Commission, as well as narrating a documentary produced by the organization on the history of the early Maryland colony.\n\n\n\n"}

He created his atelier in 1866 and a year later won the Gold Medal during the Exposition Universelle (1867).\n\nIn 1893, Frédéric Boucheron became the first jeweller to move to Place Vendôme. Legend has it that he chose 26 Place Vendôme, where Boucheron remains to this day, because it was the sunniest corner of the square. He believed that the diamonds in the windows would sparkle all the more brilliantly.\n\nIn 1893, Boucheron opened a store in Moscow, later transferred to Saint Petersburg in 1911. In 1903 a store in London and an office in New York. More store openings followed in Japan in 1973, Shanghai, Dubai in 2005, and finally Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur in 2006.\n\nBoucheron was a family business; after the death of its founder Frédéric Boucheron in 1902, his descendants took over the business.\nIn 1994, the family business shifted to a more global approach with its selling out to Schweizerhall.\n\nThe House of Boucheron was then acquired by former Gucci Group in 2000, which was bought by PPR in 2004. Pierre Bouissou was appointed CEO in April 2011 and was replaced by Helene Poulit-Duquesne in July 2015.\n\nIn 1878, the Russian Prince Felix Youssoupoff purchased a corsage decorated with 6 detachable diamond bows during one of his visits to Paris.\n\nIn 1921, Boucheron was commissioned to make a tiara for Lady Greville which was later given to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. Her grandson Prince Charles passed the tiara on to his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II also has a collection of Boucheron jewels.\n\nIn 1928, the Maharaja of Patiala asked Boucheron to set the stones of his treasure, which were brought to the Place Vendôme boutique by the prince.\n\nIn addition to Czar Alexander III, royal patrons of Boucheron have included Maharajah Sir Bhupinder Singh of Patiala, Riza Shah Pahlevi, Queen Farida of Egypt and Queen Rania of Jordan.\n\nOne of the first lines created was the symbolic snake line in the 1970s.\n\nSolange Azagury-Partridge was appointed Creative Director in 2001, she held the position for three years. 2002 saw the launch of the \"Beauté Dangereuse\" and \"Cinna Pampilles\" collections, \"Not Bourgeois\" launched the following year.\n\nIn 2004, the \"Jaipur\" High Jewellery line and the \"Déchaînée\" collection are launched.\n\n2005 is a very creative year for the House of Boucheron : the \"Trouble\", \"Quatre\", \"Diablotine\", \"Vingt-Six\" and \"Trouble Désir\" jewellery lines are launched.\n\nIn 2006 \"Exquises Confidences\" is launched, and a year later \"Fleurs Fatales\" high jewellery collection makes its debut.\n\nIn 2010, Boucheron unveiled a colorful jewellery range to enhance its \"Cinna Pampilles\" collection.\n\nIn 2011, the \"Cabinet of Curiosities\" line was launched.\n\nIn 1996 Boucheron collaborated with Waterman Paris to produce the limited edition, \"Edson signe Boucheron\". The nib was made of 18K solid gold with the body of the pen being of a blue translucent Resin. The retail price was €2000 / $2700 / £1700 and limited to only 3471 pieces (this number is the sum of the years of foundation of Waterman, 1883, and Boucheron, 1858). The pen remains one of the most sought after pieces within the fine writing category.\n\nIn 2006, Boucheron and Alexander McQueen collaborated to create a limited-edition Novak bag that incorporates the snake motif of Boucheron's Trouble line.\n\nThe beginning of a collaboration between Boucheron and Swiss watchmaker Girard-Perregaux started a year later in 2007, amongst which feature the LadyHawk Tourbillon and the limited Boucheron tribute watch.\n\nIn 2010, Boucheron and MB&F launched the HM3 JwlryMachine timepiece.\n\nIt has 34 boutiques worldwide and an online e-commerce website launched in 2007.

The watch and jewelry making segments have existed for over 150 years. The first fragrance, \"Boucheron,\" was launched in 1988. Over 22 men's and women's fragrances have been released. Since 2011 Boucheron fragrances have been created, produced and distributed under license by .\n\nBoucheron has compiled a classification system by which to determine the value of a diamond, developed on the basis of the diamond's international currency. The Boucheron method of appreciation has been registered under the name B.I.R.D. (Boucheron International Rating of Diamonds). This original classification system is based on an evaluation of diamond quality and relies on a combined analysis of two criteria: first, the degree of clarity and second, the colour of the stone. The point at which these two variables, \"clarity\" and \"colour\" intersect gives rise to a mark of appreciation of between 90/100 and 99/100 for the quality of the diamond. A mark of 100/100 would indicate that a stone possesses the ultimate degree of perfection, according to Boucheron's criteria.\n\nIn a joint venture with the mobile phone brand Vertu, Boucheron created the world's first High Jewellery limited edition cell phones out of gold and precious stones. This collaboration continued with the 150th anniversary celebration with a new line of 7 Vertu mobile phones inspired by Boucheron's High Jewellery \"Enchanting Boucheron\" anniversary collection. There are only eight pieces of the Cobra model in rose gold set all round with rubies and a pear-cut diamond and emerald eyes.

It looks nothing like the downtown district of a typical major city, and has no skyscrapers. The Central Business District's main borders are Neva River to the north and west, and the Fontanka River to the south and east, but the downtown includes areas outside.\n\nThe Central Saint Petersburg is the oldest part of the city after the Peter and Paul Fortress. When people were starting to populate Saint Petersburg they built their houses around the almost only building outside the fortress; the Admiralty building. The largest industry was ship building. The first residence of Peter the Great was a little hut (the hut hasn't been destroyed and is a museum), but he soon started to build the Summer Palace, which was located just opposite the hut, on the other side of the Neva River, and later he built a Winter Palace for himself. The central part of the city was supposed to be between the Peter and Paul Fortress and his first house.\n\nThe CBS is an area with many old buildings and has beautiful parks like the Summer Garden, Field of Mars and Mikhailovsky Garden. It is also the wealthiest area in Saint Petersburg, home to luxury hotels like Hotel Astoria and Grand Hotel Europe.

It is approximately 5.23 km² (2.02 sq mi) in size. It has a population of 149,718 people and a population density of 28,587/km² (74,040/sq mi).\n\nThe Centro district of Madrid is the oldest section of the city. Evidence of a stable settlement dates back to Spain's Muslim period. In the second half of the 9th century, the emir of Córdoba, Muhammad I (852–886), built a fortress on a promontory beside the river, the modern-day location of the Royal Palace. Its purpose was to watch the passes of the Sierra de Guadarrama and to initiate raids against the northern Christian countries. The remaining ruins of the fortress's wall are still preserved. A small suburb called Magerit developed to the east of the fortress. With the exception of the wall, few structures from this period remain.\n\nThe city passed into Christian hands in 1085, prospering into a villa by 1123. Philip II chose to place his court in Madrid in 1561, ensuring the swift evolution of the city. Many of the older buildings and monuments of the region known as El Madrid de los Austrias are from this period.\n\nThe city quickly surpassed the borders of the current Centro district; however, the majority of new monuments continue to be built in the area, including the Royal Palace and the Plaza de Cibeles. The Bourbon kings, especially Carlos III, fixated on converting Madrid into a city at the height of the new European villas, using Paris as a model. This resulted in huge investments in the infrastructure of the city, especially sewage and public buildings.\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, with the arrival of democracy, the city continued to grow. The reign of Isabella II saw the construction of the Congress of Deputies building, in Puerta del Sol.\n\nCentro currently houses the central government of the Community of Madrid, in Puerta del Sol.

His landmark 1938 book, \"The Functions of the Executive\", sets out a theory of organization and of the functions of executives in organizations. The book has been widely assigned in university courses in management theory and organizational sociology. Barnard viewed organizations as systems of cooperation of human activity, and noted that they are typically short-lived. According to Barnard, organizations are generally not long-lived because they do not meet the two criteria necessary for survival: effectiveness and efficiency.\n\nIn his youth, Barnard worked on a farm, then studied economics at Harvard University, earning money selling pianos and operating a dance band. He did not obtain his Harvard BA because he did his four-year work in three years and could not complete a science course, but a number of universities later granted him honorary doctorates.\n\nBarnard joined the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (now AT&T) in 1909. In 1927, he became president of the New Jersey Bell Telephone Company. During the Great Depression, he directed the New Jersey state relief system.\n\nHe was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1939. He was president of the United Service Organizations (USO), 1942-45. Upon retiring from business, he served as president of the Rockefeller Foundation, 1948–52, and as chairman of the National Science Foundation, 1952-54. End 1950s he was among the first members of the Society for General Systems Research.\n\nBarnard viewed organizations as systems of cooperation of human activity, and noted that they are typically short-lived. It is rare for a firm to last more than a century. Similarly most nations last for less than a century. The only organization that can claim a substantial age is the Roman Catholic Church. According to Barnard, organizations are not long-lived because they do not meet the two criteria necessary for survival: effectiveness and efficiency. Effectiveness, is defined the usual way: as being able to accomplish stated goals. In contrast, Barnard's meaning of organizational efficiency differed substantially from the conventional use of the word. He defined efficiency of an organization as the degree to which that organization is able to satisfy the motives of the individuals. If an organization satisfies the motives of its members while attaining its explicit goals, cooperation among its members will last.\n\nBarnard was a great admirer of Talcott Parsons (1902–1979) and he and Parsons corresponded persistently. The two scholars would send manuscripts for commentary to each other and they would write long letters where they engage in a common theoretical discussion. The first correspondence between Barnard and Parsons began in the end of the 1930s and it persisted essentially to Barnard’s death in 1961.\n\nBarnard's classic 1938 book, \"The Functions of the Executive\" discusses, as the title suggests, the functions of the executive, but not from a merely intuitive point of view, but instead deriving them from his conception of cooperative systems.\n\nBarnard summarized the functions of the executive as follows: \n\nBarnard formulated two interesting theories: one of authority and the other of incentives. Both are seen in the context of a communication system grounded in seven essential rules: \n\nThus, what makes a communication authoritative, rests with the subordinate, rather than with his superior. Barnard's perspective had affinities to that of Mary Parker Follett and was very unusual for his time, and that has remained the case down to the present day. He seemed to argue that managers should obtain authority by treating subordinates with respect and competence.\n\nAs for incentives, he proposed two ways of convincing subordinates to cooperate: tangible incentives and persuasion. Barnard gives great importance to persuasion, much more than to economic incentives. He described four general, and four specific incentives. \nThe specific incentives were:\n\nThe general incentives were:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They are often shown at the end of movies and on CD jackets. In film, video, television, theater, etc., \"credits\" means the list of actors and behind-the-scenes staff who contributed to the production.\n\nIn non-fiction writing, especially academic works, it is generally considered important to give credit to sources of information and ideas. Failure to do so often gives rise to charges of plagiarism, and \"piracy\" of intellectual rights such as the right to receive a royalty for having written. In this sense the financial and individual meanings are linked.\n\nAcademic papers generally contain a lengthy section of footnotes or citations. Such detailed crediting of sources provides readers with an opportunity to discover more about the cited material. It also provides a check against misquotation, as it's easy for an attributed quote to be checked when the reference is available. All of this is thought to improve integrity of the instructional capital conveyed, which may be quite fragile, and easy to misinterpret or to misapply.\n\nIn fiction writing, authors are generally expected to give credit to those who contributed significantly to a work. Sometimes authors who do not want credit for their work directly may choose to use a pen name. A ghostwriter gives all or some of the credit for his or her writing to someone else.\n\nIn computer software licenses, attribution of credit is sometimes a condition of licensing. For example, original versions of the BSD license controversially required credit to be provided in the advertisement for software that used licensed code, but only if features or use of the licensed software was mentioned in the advertisement.\n\nSoftware documentation is sometimes licensed under similar terms. For example, the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL) used by Wikipedia requires that acknowledgments to authors be preserved.\n\n"}

It involves a clearly defined set of tangible (goods) and intangible (services) features that the customer recognizes, purchase or use. This can be the real or perceived value that a customer experiences or believes they are receiving through dealing with a company.\n\nA combination of a primary product with additional goods and services defines the total product to the customer. In other words, a CBP is a combination of services and goods that adds value to the primary product acquired by the customer. The primary product is the “core” offering that attracts customers and satisfy their basic needs. These goods and services adding value to the primary product are called peripheral goods and services, which are not essential to the primary product, but enhance it. Examples of peripheral goods and services in the fast food industry include toys (peripheral goods) that are offered as part of a kiddie’s meal and a kids' play area (peripheral service) inside the fast food restaurant.\n\nThe CBP may also contain some variants as part of the product offering. A variant is an attribute that departs from the CBP overall theme. Adding unique goods or services like free Internet access inside the fast food restaurant gives the customer the ability to surf the Internet while enjoying a meal. Often a variant will become part of the CBP on a continuous basis, thus it becomes a permanent peripheral good or service.\n\nThe CBP cannot stand on its own as a system or tool. OM requires effective management of the whole value chain starting with identifying the customer’s needs and ending with supplying a final product that meets or exceeds the customer’s expectations. Developing the CBP through all these stages of the value chain is essential to create and deliver a process for each peripheral good or service adding to the overall development of the final product to the customer.\n\nThe requirements of the customer (client) are clearly defined within a contract agreement between the contractor and the customer. However, there are a number of peripheral good and services that can be developed in this highly controlled environment. Disciples like quality management and risk management in conjunction with information technology (IT) systems and operations management (OM) processes can be used to develop systems with the ability to capture real-time data and report directly to the customer. This is just one example of many more possibilities that can differentiate a contractor from the competition.\n\nMedicine is evolving daily; there are new cures to diseases, new vaccines and new diagnostic technology that once thought impossible. \"There is however an extreme lack in incorporating information technology (IT) and OM processes within medical practices. I have therefore decided to re-evaluate the value chain within my new general practitioner (GP) practice\", a South African doctor comments. Living in the information age, patients want to know everything, so much a new term \"googlelitis\" is used in describing many patients. Embracing this new culture (need) amongst patients can be satisfied with the use of short message service (SMS) technology to report medical results and confirm future appointments.\n"}

The World Bank estimates that Djibouti will maintain a 7% rate of growth in 2017. This economic outlook is strengthened by large-scale investment in construction and infrastructure in Djibouti and the wider East Africa region.\n\nThe Djibouti Ports & Free Zones Authority contributes to and leads several of these projects. The DPFZA’s highly trained staff coordinate with government agencies and international partners to focus Djibouti’s strategic development, support the flow of capital investment, and manage the construction railways, airports and power plants. Fast-paced growth has led to an increase in competition and a diversification of consumer markets, which is transforming the economy in the long-term. In turn, financial institutions, such as the Central Bank of Djibouti (Banque Centrale de Djibouti, BCD) is working with its partners to develop new regulation, frameworks and technological solutions to support growth, manage risk and promote increased corporate and financial activity.\n\nAboubaker Omar Hadi has served as the Chairman of the Djibouti Ports & Free Zones Authority (DPFZA) since July 2, 2011. His career has spanned over 30 years, beginning in the Port of Djibouti where he worked in the Marine Department and Port Control and was responsible for port documentation in 1978. Throughout his career, he has also served as Deputy Manager in the statistics department, General Cargo Manager, Container Terminal Manager and Commercial Director of the port.\nAboubaker Omar Hadi has been instrumental in improving trade relations between Djibouti and Ethiopia, to the extent where the neighbouring country now uses Djibouti’s ports for over 90% of its foreign trade. \nMore recently he has led the expansion of Djibouti’s ports and free zones as the nation strives to become the commercial trade hub of East Africa.\nAboubaker Omar Hadi completed his First Degree in Ports and Multimodal Transport from Le Conservatoire Nationale des Arts et Metiers, in France, and also holds a master's degree in Ports and Shipping Administration from the World Maritime University of Sweden.\n\nThe Djibouti Ports and Free Zones Authority (DPFZA) engages in projects with renowned global partners to strengthen Djibouti’s role as a logistics and infrastructure hub. \nIts strategic position grants vessels and cargo direct access to strategic passages, such as the Suez Canal. Its proximity to developing landlocked economies such as Ethiopia provides opportunities for bilateral and multi-lateral cooperation. In fact, Djibouti-Ethiopia relations has been praised as a model of regional integration. \nDjibouti launched a $15 billion expansion program, which includes the development of airports, highways, and other key national infrastructure projects. In support of this growth, commercial institutions like the Djibouti International Free Trade Zone and the Silk Road International Bank have been set up to modernize existing services, and facilitate the development of these projects.\n\nThe Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway is a standard gauge international railway that links Addis Ababa with the port of Djibouti on the Gulf of Aden, providing landlocked Ethiopia with railroad access to the sea. More than 95% of Ethiopia's trade passes through Djibouti. \nChina Railway Group and the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation started construction on the railway in 2011, and were financed by the Exim Bank of China, the China Development Bank, and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. The project was completed in 2016, with a total investment of $4 billion, making the electrified train a key element of the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nThe Djibouti International Free Trade Zone (DIFTZ) will transform trade in the region and provide a strategic base for global businesses to access the rapidly growing African market. Construction of DIFTZ began a week after the completion of the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway, a new 752 km track linking Ethiopia’s capital with the Port of Djibouti.\nThe Djibouti Ports & Free Zones Authority partnered with China Merchants Group, Dalian Port Authority and IZP to form the DIFTZ Project Preparatory Group. Together, they began the construction on the $3.5 billion dollar free trade zone, which extends over 4,800 hectares. \nThe initiative is expected to create 200,000 new jobs, and cement Djibouti’s role as the strategic link between global maritime trade routes in the Belt and Road Initiative.\nIn coordination with Djibouti’s government agencies, the DPFZA oversees the construction, management and administration of several ports and facilities.\n\nThe Port of Djibouti – also known as the Red Sea Port – facilitates the transit of around 30,000 vessels every year. The Djibouti Ports & Free Zones Authority supports the port’s activities by linking it to the Doraleh Multipurpose Port, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and oil terminal, and two additional ports dedicated to Salt and Potash.\n\nThe Horizon Djibouti Terminal is equipped to meet the demands of petroleum trade and shipping, with a storage capacity of 371,000 cubic meters, loading bays and equipment capable of fulfilling local, regional and contango (Trading) needs. \nThe Horizon Djibouti Terminal was constructed in response to rapid economic developments in East Africa - such as the spread of independent oil companies and increased logistical activities. \nThe HDTL’s facilities are expected to evolve with the changing landscape of maritime shipping of petroleum, and adapt to offer services that meet the traditional and unpredictable demands of Africa’s natural resource sector.\n\nThe Djibouti Ports & Free Zones Authority offers a mix of commercial and non-commercial services, in coordination with the relevant government agencies.\n\nDjibouti Ports & Free Zones Authority regulates the procedures for setting up a company in Djibouti. Applicants can obtain a license to operate through the authority. The DPFZA also processes work permits for foreign workers and facilitates applications concurrently with companies.\n\nThe Djibouti Ports & Free Zones Authority performs administrative functions, such as compliance and performance audits, regulates cost frameworks for maritime and freight shipping, and issues the necessary licenses for companies operating within Djibouti or its ports.\n\nThe Djibouti Ports & Free Zones Authority processes applications for:\n\n\n"}

The name comes from earnings per share (EPS), the bottom line number in the income statement divided by the number of shares outstanding. The US-based National Investor Relations Institute (NIRI) says that 92% of companies represented by their members conduct earnings calls and that virtually all of these are webcast. Transcripts of calls may be made available either by the company or a third party.\n\nThe calls are usually preceded or accompanied by a press release containing a summary of the financial results, and possibly by a more detailed filing under securities law. Earnings calls usually happen, or at least begin, while the stock market on which the company's shares are traded is closed to trading, so that all investors will have had a chance to hear management's presentation before trading in the stock resumes.\n\nGenerally, the call will begin with a company official, typically the Investor Relations Officer (IRO), reading a safe harbor statement to limit the company's liability should actual results prove different from expected indicators reported in the discussion. Then one or more company officials, often including the Chief executive officer and Chief financial officer, will discuss the operational results and financial statements for the period just ended and their outlook for the future. The teleconference will then be opened for questions by investors, financial analysts, and other call participants. Management will answer many of these questions, although if the data is unavailable to them they may decline or defer response. Depending on the size and complexity of the company, the difference between actual and expected results, and other factors, the length of the call will vary.\n\nThere is no general requirement for how far in advance notice of a call must be given. However, keeping the investor and analyst communities happy is part of management's job, so the call will generally be announced a few days or weeks in advance. If the company has a website, then there will probably be a section titled \"Investor Relations\" or \"Investors\", where call schedules and archived past calls will typically be posted.\n\nMany companies are tracked by financial analysts that publish estimates of earnings per share (EPS). The company may also provide financial guidance as to what EPS are likely to be. If management knows that its results are going to be significantly different from its guidance or from analyst expectations, it may choose to make a preannouncement of differing results.\n\nIn 2013, the National Investor Relations Institute (NIRI) published \"Standards of Practice: Earnings Release Content\", available to NIRI members.\n\nIf the call occurs within 48 hours of a press release filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Form 8-K and meets certain other criteria, there is no obligation to separately report the call to the SEC. Otherwise, it must be reported on Form 8-K. If the call contains non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) information, then there are additional requirements under SEC regulations, including Regulation FD.\n\nCompanies headquartered in the United States with securities traded on a US-based stock market or other exchange are required to file audited annual reports with the SEC on Form 10-K following the end of a fiscal year and unaudited reports on Form 10-Q following the end of a fiscal quarter. These companies announce earnings and generally hold an earnings call quarterly.\n\nSome companies with shares traded on foreign stock exchanges also have American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) that are traded on US stock exchanges and are required to file Forms 20-F and 6K with the SEC. They are likely to have their earnings announcements and calls coordinated with the schedule required in the country where their shares are traded.\n\n"}

After working as a journalist and then as an administrator of \"Diário Popular\" (the \"People's Daily\" in English) from 1963 to 1971, he founded the \"Expresso\" magazine in 1973 and continued to direct it until 1980.

Despite his reputation for competence, he was widely perceived as lacking Sá Carneiro's charisma. He had difficulty maintaining the level of support enjoyed by his party, which had been based to a large extent on Sá Carneiro's personal popularity. He also had to cope with friction within the Democratic Alliance, and found the Democratic and Social Centre leader, Diogo Freitas do Amaral, a difficult ally. These factors contributed to his defeat in the parliamentary election of 1983.

Black Emperor is a Canadian experimental music collective which originated in Montreal, Quebec in 1994. The group releases recordings through Constellation, an independent record label also located in Montreal. After the release of their debut album in 1997, the group toured regularly from 1998 to 2002. In 2003, the band announced an indefinite hiatus in order for members to pursue other musical interests. In the intervening period, the group was occasionally rumored to have broken up, but finally reconvened for a tour which began in late 2010. Since reforming, they have released three more albums, the most recent being \"Luciferian Towers\" in September 2017.\n\nThe band has gained a dedicated cult following and remains very influential in the post-rock genre. In September 2013, \"Allelujah! Don't Bend! Ascend!\" won the 2013 Polaris Music Prize.\n\nThe band is also known for their song \"East Hastings\" from the 1997 album \"F♯ A♯ ∞\", which was used in the film \"28 Days Later\" in an edited version. \"East Hastings\" does not appear on the \"\" because the rights to the song could not be obtained.\n\nGodspeed You! Black Emperor was formed in 1994 in Montreal, Quebec, by Efrim Menuck (guitar), Mike Moya (guitar), and Mauro Pezzente (bass). The band took its name from \"God Speed You! Black Emperor\", a 1976 Japanese black-and-white documentary by director Mitsuo Yanagimachi, which follows the exploits of a Japanese biker gang, the Black Emperors. The band initially assembled after being offered a supporting act for another local band named Steak 72. Thereafter, the trio performed live on a few separate occasions, before ultimately deciding to produce an album. The cassette, \"All Lights Fucked on the Hairy Amp Drooling\", was self-released in December 1994 and limited to thirty-three copies.\n\nAfter the limited release of the cassette, the band quickly expanded and continued to perform live periodically. According to Menuck, joining the group was quite simple: \"It was like if anyone knew anybody who played an instrument and seemed like an okay person, they would sort of join up.\" In short order, the group's numbers ebbed and flowed. Local musicians would often join the band for a handful of performances, then depart. The revolving door nature of the group's membership frequently caused it strain before the release of \"F♯ A♯ ∞\". After that release, the group stabilized around a nine-person lineup with Menuck, Moya and David Bryant on guitars, Pezzente and Thierry Amar on bass guitars, Aidan Girt and Bruce Cawdron on drums, and Sophie Trudeau and Norsola Johnson on violin and cello respectively. Moya would depart in 1998 to focus on HṚṢṬA, being replaced by Roger Tellier-Craig of Fly Pan Am.\n\nAlthough various members of the band are often pinned down as anarchists, for a rather long time no one in the band explicitly subscribed to this label; however, as of 2014, Menuck was calling himself an anarchist. In any case, there is a strong political component to the band's music. For example, the liner notes to \"Yanqui U.X.O.\" describe the song \"09-15-00\" as \"Ariel Sharon surrounded by 1,000 Israeli soldiers marching on al-Haram Ash-Sharif & provoking another Intifada,\" and the back cover of that album depicts the relationships of several major record labels to the military–industrial complex. Several of its songs also incorporate voice samples which express political sentiments, most notably \"The Dead Flag Blues\" (on \"F♯A♯∞\") and \"BBF3\" (on \"Slow Riot for New Zerø Kanada\").\n\nMembers of the group have formed a number of side projects, including Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra & Tra-La-La Band, Fly Pan Am, HṚṢṬA, Esmerine, and Set Fire to Flames.\n\nThe band released the CD versions of its first two albums and EP on the Kranky record label, and released the LPs through Constellation Records. All editions of their subsequent studio material have been released through Constellation.\n\nIn 2004, long-time guitarist Roger Tellier-Craig left the band on amicable terms to devote more time to Fly Pan Am.\n\nThe group was once misconstrued as being a band of terrorists. After stopping at a local gas station for fuel in the town of Ardmore, Oklahoma, during their 2003 tour of the United States, the station attendant working that day believed the group of Canadians to be terrorists. She quickly passed a note to another customer asking them to call the police. When the local police appeared, the group was held until it could be questioned by the FBI. Although the police were suspicious of the band's anti-government documents and some photos it had (such as those of oil rigs), they found no incriminating evidence. After background checks were run, the ensemble was released from custody and continued on its way to its next show in Saint Louis, MO. Efrim Menuck later spoke to the crowd during their appearance in Missouri about what happened to them and speculated that their origin was a motive for being released quickly (\"It's a good thing we're nice white kids from Canada\"). The incident was mentioned in Michael Moore's book \"Dude, Where's My Country?\".\n\nIn 2010, the band reported it was reuniting for an All Tomorrow's Parties music event in the UK as well as further US dates. Mike Moya re-joined the band for the reunion, while original cellist Norsola Johnson declined to participate. The band played a full North American and European tour in 2011, and more dates in the UK including an appearance at the ATP 'I'll Be Your Mirror' music festival in London.\n\nIn 2011, in an interview with Voir, band member Bruce Cawdron announced that the band was working on new material.\n\nOn February 28, 2012, it was announced that the band would be performing at the 2012 Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago. On March 15, 2012, it was announced that the band would be performing at the 2012 All Tomorrow's Parties I'll Be Your Mirror festival in New York.

She earned her full name after marrying Harvey Fuqua and kept the name after their divorce.\n\nGwen Gordy was born to Berry Gordy Sr. and Bertha Ida (née Fuller) Gordy in Detroit. She was the youngest of the four Gordy sisters (Esther, Anna and Loucye) and the third youngest of the entire family (brothers Berry and Robert were born after her).\n\nFollowing graduation from high school, Gwen owned the photo concession at Detroit's popular Flame Show Bar, which helped to make her a celebrity in Detroit's nightlife. By the late 1950s, Gordy had also become a cheerleader for brother Berry's musical efforts. She provided Berry with his first important music business contact when she introduced him to the manager of the club, a white man named Al Green. Green managed music stars like Johnnie Ray and LaVern Baker and he had just signed a new singer from Detroit named Jackie Wilson.\n\nGreen also owned a music publishing company and was looking for new material. She had a songwriting partnership with her brother Berry Gordy and Roquel \"Billy\" Davis, a childhood friend who had connections with Chess Records in Chicago. The partners started out with a bang by writing \"Jim Dandy Got Married\" for LaVern Baker on the Atlantic label and \"All I Could Do Was Cry\" for Etta James on Argo, a Chess subsidiary label. By far, however, their greatest early success was writing the first big hits for Jackie Wilson.\nStarting with \"Reet Petite\", Gwen, Berry and Davis penned five consecutive Jackie Wilson hits. \"Lonely Teardrops\", \"That's Why (I Love You So)\", \"To Be Loved\", and \"I'll Be Satisfied\" all established Wilson as one of Rock and Roll's hottest new stars.\nGordy earned small pay during this period of her work with Wilson's label Brunswick.\n\nAlthough Berry, Gwen, and Roquel had provided five consecutive hits for Jackie Wilson, they had to split the songwriting royalties three ways. To bring in more income, Berry demanded that some of their songs be used for the B sides on Wilson's recordings. After he was turned down by manager Nat Tarnopol, the trio decided to end their association with Jackie.\n\nGwen Gordy was the first to put the idea of starting a record company into action. She formed a label with Roquel Davis and named the company 'Anna', after her sister. Davis then used his contacts to make a deal with Chess Records to distribute their new Anna label nationally. Gwen and Roquel both wanted Berry to become a partner with them. However, Berry decided to go out on his own. The label helped to distribute the local Tamla Records single, Barrett Strong's \"Money (That's What I Want)\", which became a top 40 hit in 1960.\n\nThat year, Gordy co-wrote the ballad \"All I Could Do Was Cry\", which was originally offered to Erma Franklin (Aretha's sister), who almost signed with Anna Records but was rebuffed by her father, C. L. Franklin. The song eventually was sold by Chess Records who recorded the song with Etta James. Shortly after meeting Harvey Fuqua, they founded the labels Harvey Records and Tri-Phi Records, the latter label including The Spinners, who recorded their first hit with the Gordy/Fuqua composition, \"That's What Girls Are Made For\".\n\nIn 1961, Motown absorbed Anna Records, signing Marvin Gaye in the process. The Harvey and Tri-Phi labels were absorbed by Motown two years later after that and Gordy and Fuqua accepted staff jobs with Motown, with Gordy handling business affairs, while Fuqua became a staff writer and producer. Alongside sister Anna, she co-headed Motown's Artist Development course and by the mid-1960s was managing acts such as the Spinners, Shorty Long, Junior Walker & the All Stars and Tammi Terrell, who signed to Motown in 1965. Gordy convinced Motown to allow Terrell to perform duets with Gaye.\n\nIn 1973, Gordy had hand in adding lyrics to Marvin Gaye's composition, \"Distant Lover\", which became a hit single a year later after Motown released a live recording of the song. In 1977, Gordy founded Gwen Glenn Productions and produced for Motown acts such as High Inergy before retiring from the music business in the early 1980s.\n\nGordy dated fellow composer Billy Davis for a number of years. However, the relationship imploded after Gordy got involved with Harvey Fuqua. Gordy and Fuqua married in 1961 and Gordy was known afterwards as Gwen Gordy Fuqua for the duration of her life, though in 1968, Gordy and Fuqua divorced. After most of the Spinners left Motown for Atlantic Records in 1972, she struck up a romance with ex-Spinners bandmate G.C. Cameron, managed his career and later marrying him.\n\nThe couple broke up in the late 1970s after Cameron left Motown. Gordy's production company \"Gwen Glenn\" was named after Gwen's son Glenn Gordy. Gordy moved to California in the early 1970s, where she'd remained until her death and lived comfortably off royalties after her career ended in the early 1980s.\n\nGwen succumbed to cancer at her home in San Diego, California on November 8, 1999 at the age of 71. She was buried in Detroit, Michigan.\n"}
{"id": "14031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14031", "title": "Hierarchical organization", "text": "Hierarchical organization\n\nA hierarchical organization is an organizational structure where every entity in the organization, except one, is subordinate to a single other entity. This arrangement is a form of a hierarchy. In an organization, the hierarchy usually consists of a singular/group of power at the top with subsequent levels of power beneath them. This is the dominant mode of organization among large organizations; most corporations, governments, and organized religions are hierarchical organizations with different levels of management, power or authority. For example, the broad, top-level overview of the general organization of the Catholic Church consists of the Pope, then the Cardinals, then the Archbishops, and so on. \n\nMembers of hierarchical organizational structures chiefly communicate with their immediate superior and with their immediate subordinates. Structuring organizations in this way is useful partly because it can reduce the communication overhead by limiting information flow; this is also its major limitation.\n\nA hierarchy is typically visualized as a pyramid, where the height of the ranking or person depicts their power status and the width of that level represents how many people or business divisions are at that level relative to the whole—the highest-ranking people are at the apex, and there are very few of them; the base may include thousands of people who have no subordinates. These hierarchies are typically depicted with a tree or triangle diagram, creating an organizational chart or organigram. Those nearest the top have more power than those nearest the bottom, and there being fewer people at the top than at the bottom. As a result, superiors in a hierarchy generally have higher status and command greater rewards than their subordinates.\n\nAll governments and most companies have similar structures. Traditionally, the monarch was the pinnacle of the state. In many countries, feudalism and manorialism provided a formal social structure that established hierarchical links at every level of society, with the monarch at the top. \n\nIn modern post-feudal states the nominal top of the hierarchy still remains the head of state, which may be a president or a constitutional monarch, although in many modern states the powers of the head of state are delegated among different bodies. Below the head, there is commonly a senate, parliament or congress, which in turn often delegate the day-to-day running of the country to a prime minister. In many democracies, the people are considered to be the notional top of the hierarchy, over the head of state; in reality, the people's power is restricted to voting in elections.\n\nIn business, the business owner traditionally occupied the pinnacle of the organization. In most modern large companies, there is now no longer a single dominant shareholder, and the collective power of the business owners is for most purposes delegated to a board of directors, which in turn delegates the day-to-day running of the company to a managing director or CEO. Again, although the shareholders of the company are the nominal top of the hierarchy, in reality many companies are run at least in part as personal fiefdoms by their management; corporate governance rules are an attempt to mitigate this tendency.\n\nThe organizational development theorist Elliott Jacques identified a special role for hierarchy in his concept of requisite organization. \nThe iron law of oligarchy, introduced by Robert Michels, describes the inevitable tendency of hierarchical organizations to become oligarchic in their decision making.\n\nThe Peter Principle is a term coined by Laurence J. Peter in which the selection of a candidate for a position in an hierarchical organization is based on the candidate's performance in their current role, rather than on abilities relevant to the intended role. Thus, employees only stop being promoted once they can no longer perform effectively, and managers in an hierarchical organization \"rise to the level of their incompetence.\" \n\nHierarchiology is another term coined by Laurence J. Peter, described in his humorous book of the same name, to refer to the study of hierarchical organizations and the behavior of their members.\n\nThe IRG Solution – hierarchical incompetence and how to overcome it argued that hierarchies were inherently incompetent, and were only able to function due to large amounts of informal lateral communication fostered by private informal networks.\n\nIn the work of diverse theorists such as William James (1842–1910), Michel Foucault (1926–1984) and Hayden White, important critiques of hierarchical epistemology are advanced. James famously asserts in his work \"Radical Empiricism\" that clear distinctions of type and category are a constant but unwritten goal of scientific reasoning, so that when they are discovered, success is declared. But if aspects of the world are organized differently, involving inherent and intractable ambiguities, then scientific questions are often considered unresolved. A hesitation to declare success upon the discovery of ambiguities leaves heterarchy at an artificial and subjective disadvantage in the scope of human knowledge. This bias is an artifact of an aesthetic or pedagogical preference for hierarchy, and not necessarily an expression of objective observation.\n\nHierarchies and hierarchical thinking has been criticized by many people, including Susan McClary and one political philosophy which is vehemently opposed to hierarchical organization: anarchism. Heterarchy is the most commonly proposed alternative to hierarchy and this has been combined with responsible autonomy by Gerard Fairtlough in his work on Triarchy theory. The most beneficial aspect of a hierarchical organization is the clear command that is established. However, hierarchy may become dismantled by abuse of power.\n\nAmidst constant innovation in information and communication technologies, hierarchical authority structures are giving way to greater decision-making latitude for individuals and more flexible definitions of job activities and this new style of work presents a challenge to existing organizational forms, with some research studies contrasting traditional organizational forms against groups that operate as online communities that are characterized by personal motivation and the satisfaction of making one's own decisions. With all levels of an organization having access to information and communication via digital means, power structures align more as a wirearchy, enabling the flow of power and authority to be based not on hierarchical levels, but on information, trust, credibility, and a focus on results.\n"}

Galbraith (Feb. 26, 1939 - April 8, 2014) was an American organizational theorist, consultant and Professor at the International Institute for Management Development, known for his work on strategy and organization design.\n\nBorn in Cincinnati, Ohio, Galbraith obtained his BSc in Chemical Engineering in 1962 at the University of Cincinnati, and at the Indiana University his MBA in 1964, and his PhD in Business Administration with the thesis, entitled \"Motivational Determinants of Job Performance: An Empirical Study.\"\n\nGalbraith had started his academic career as Instructor at the Indiana University in 1964. In 1966 he moved to MIT Sloan School of Management, where he was appointed Assistant professor and became associate Professor in 1970. From 1962 to 1966 he was Professor at the European Institute of Advanced Studies in Management, Brussels. From 1974 to 1978 he was Professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and from 1986 to 1995 Professor of Clinical Management at the USC Marshall School of Business and Senior Research Scientist at its Center for Effective Organizations. In Lausanne, Switzerland he was Professor at the International Institute for Management Development from 1995 to 2000, where he became Professor Emeritus in 2000. Back in the United States, he rejoined the USC Center for Effective Organizations as Senior Research Scientist.\n\nIn 1978 Galbraith had started his own consultancy firm Jay R.

His book \"Organization Design\" was elected \"Outstanding Book on Organization in 1976 - 1977\" by the Organization Development Council in 1977, and his \"Organizing for the Future,\" was second in the Industry Week's top ten books of the year 1993.\n\nOrganization design can be defined narrowly, as the process of reshaping organization structure and roles, or it can more effectively be defined as the alignment of structure, process, rewards, metrics and talent with the strategy of the business. Jay Galbraith and Amy Kates have made the case persuasively (building on years of work by Galbraith) that attention to all of these organizational elements is necessary to create new capabilities to compete in a given market. This systemic view, often referred to as the \"star model\" approach, is more likely to lead to better performance.\n\nOrganization design may involve strategic decisions, but is properly viewed as a path to effective strategy execution. The design process nearly always entails making trade-offs of one set of structural benefits against another. Many companies fall into the trap of making repeated changes in organization structure, with little benefit to the business. This often occurs because changes in structure are relatively easy to execute while creating the impression that something substantial is happening. This often leads to cynicism and confusion within the organization. More powerful change happens when there are clear design objectives driven by a new business strategy or forces in the market that require a different approach to organizing resources.\n\n\n\n"}

Cramer (born February 10, 1955) is an American television personality, former hedge fund manager, and best-selling author. Cramer is the host of CNBC's \"Mad Money\" and a co-founder of TheStreet, Inc.\nCramer was born in 1955 in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania (a suburb of Philadelphia), to Jewish parents. Cramer's mother, Louise A. Cramer, was an artist. Cramer's father, N. Ken Cramer, owned International Packaging Products in Philadelphia; the company sold wrapping paper, boxes and bags to retailers and restaurants.\nIn one of his first jobs, he sold ice cream at Veterans Stadium during Philadelphia Phillies games. \nCramer went to Springfield Township High School in Montgomery County. He lives in Summit, New Jersey.\n\nIn 1977, Cramer graduated \"magna cum laude\" from Harvard College with a B.A. in government. Cramer began his involvement with journalism in college, where he was the President and Editor-in-Chief of \"The Harvard Crimson\". In 1984, Cramer received his Juris Doctor degree from Harvard Law School.\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard, Cramer worked in several entry-level reporting jobs. Dating back to March 1, 1978, Cramer worked for the \"Tallahassee Democrat\" in Tallahassee, Florida, where he covered the Ted Bundy murders. Then-executive editor, Richard Oppel, has said \"[Cramer] was like a driving ram. He was great at getting the story.\" He subsequently wrote for the \"Los Angeles Herald-Examiner\". During this time, his apartment was robbed on multiple occasions, eventually losing all of his possessions and forcing him to live out of his car for several months. He also worked for Governor Jerry Brown.\n\nCramer was one of the first reporters at \"American Lawyer\". During his years at Harvard Law School, Cramer worked as a research assistant for Alan Dershowitz. He assisted Dershowitz's campaign to acquit alleged murderer Claus von Bülow despite the fact that Cramer believed von Bülow was \"supremely guilty.\" Cramer was admitted to the New York Bar in 1985 but his license to practice law was suspended on April 2, 2009 for failure to pay the registration fee.\n\nCramer started investing in the stock market during his time at law school. Cramer began promoting his holdings by leaving stock picks on his answering machine. This impressed \"The New Republic\" owner Martin Peretz, who gave him $500,000 to invest. In two years, Cramer made $150,000 for Peretz.\n\nCramer's track record helped him obtain employment in 1984 as a stockbroker with Goldman Sachs' Private Wealth Management division. Cramer's success in this position led him to found his own hedge fund, Cramer & Co. (later Cramer, Berkowitz & Co.), in 1987. The fund operated out of the offices of hedge fund pioneer Michael Steinhardt's Steinhardt, Fine, Berkowitz & Co. and early investors included Eliot Spitzer (a Harvard classmate, one of his oldest friends and former Governor of New York who resigned), Brill, and Peretz.\n\nDuring Cramer's tenure with the fund from 1988 to 2000, he had one year of negative returns in 1998. The following year, the fund returned 47% and in 2000 28%, beating the S&P 500 by 38 percentage points. Cramer retired from his hedge fund in 2001, finishing with a 24% average annual return over 14 years and having \"routinely [taken] home $10 million a year and more.\" The fund was taken over by his former partner Jeff Berkowitz after Cramer's retirement. During that time, he was also an \"editor at large\" for \"SmartMoney\" magazine and was accused of unethically combining his investing and reporting activities when he bought stocks that he recommended just before his recommendation article came out, contributing to a $2 million personal gain. Today, Cramer is barred by CNBC from trading stocks with his personal funds although he makes picks and sells his recommendations.\n\nIn 1996 Cramer co-founded TheStreet, Inc. [formerly TheStreet.com, Inc.] with \"The New Republic\" editor Martin Peretz, one of his hedge fund's original clients. Cramer is currently a market commentator and adviser to the TheStreet, Inc. and is its second-largest shareholder. Cramer also manages a charitable trust stock portfolio which is tied to TheStreet, Inc. through a paid subscription service called Action Alerts \"PLUS\" Portfolio. Cramer owns a 10 per cent stake in TheStreet, the market value of which peaked at $1.7 billion but by 2014, the Nasdaq-listed company was worth less than $80 million.\n\nCramer claimed to be worth $50 to $100 million in October 2005.\n\nIn 2009, Cramer received earnings of $461,276 from TheStreet, Inc. As of 2010, Cramer was the chairman of the board of TheStreet.com, Inc.\n\nThe cable television program \"Mad Money with Jim Cramer\" first aired on CNBC in 2005. According to CNBC's Web site in an article titled, \"Mad Money Manifesto\" by Jim Cramer, the show's mission statement and Cramer's job:\n\n... is not to tell you what to think but to teach you how to think about the market like a pro. This show is not about picking stocks. It's not about giving you tips that will make you money overnight – tips are for waiters. Our mission is educational, to teach you how to analyze stocks and the market through the prism of events.\n\nTo provide DIY investors and other viewers with \"the knowledge and the tools that will empower you to be a better investor,\" \"Mad Money\" features many segments, including: The \"Lightning Round\", \"Game Plan\", \"Execution Decision\", \"Off the Charts\", \"Sell Block\", \"Market Marshmallows\", \"Outrage of the Day\", \"Mad Bull Disease\", \"Am I Diversified\", and \"Mad Mail\".\n\nAfter being a frequent guest commentator on CNBC in the late 1990s, Cramer co-hosted CNBC shows \"America Now\" and \"Kudlow & Cramer\" with Lawrence Kudlow in the early 2000s.\n\nCramer hosted a one-hour radio show, \"Jim Cramer's Real Money\", until December 2006. \"Take the Money and Run\" by the Steve Miller Band was the intro to each of his radio shows. The show was similar to his \"Mad Money\" TV show. He also guest-hosted in the slot caused by the cancellation of \"Imus in the Morning\" (MSNBC and WFAN/Westwood One) in May 2007.\n\nOn November 13, 2005, Dan Rather did a sit-down interview with Cramer on \"60 Minutes\". Among the topics of discussion were Cramer's past at his hedge fund; for example, his violent temper and what finally led him to come to his senses and \"calm down.\" Footage of Cramer at his family home with his daughters and wife was also included. On November 15, 2005, Cramer mentioned on his program that he received hundreds of e-mails after his \"60 Minutes\" interview. This report was taped before Cramer's radio show, \"Smart Money with Jim Cramer\" moved to WOR and became syndicated under the CBS Radio banner.\n\nIn 2005, Cramer appeared as himself in two episodes of the television series \"Arrested Development\". He appeared to first announce that he had upgraded Bluth Company stock to a \"Don't Buy\" from a \"Triple Sell,\" and then to say that the stock was not a \"Don't Buy\" anymore, but a \"Risky.\"\n\nCramer has also made appearances on NBC's \"Today\", \"NBC Nightly News\", \"Live with Regis and Kelly\", ESPN Classic's \"Cheap Seats\", NBC's \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\", Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\", \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\", \"Late Show with David Letterman\", ABC's \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" and NBC's \"The Apprentice\" called \"The Celebrity Apprentice.\"\n\nCramer also appeared in the 2008 motion picture \"Iron Man\" spoofing Stark Industries on his show \"Mad Money\", and appears in the movie \"\". He also claims to have consulted for the original \"Wall Street\" movie by telling the filmmakers how he would get through to Gordon Gekko.\n\nOn March 12, 2009, Jon Stewart interviewed Cramer on \"The Daily Show\" and challenged Cramer's recommendations of Bear Stearns.\n\nOn November 3, 2009, Cramer appeared on \"The Martha Stewart Show\" to promote his new book \"Getting Back to Even\". Cramer stated that it was a great time to invest in real estate and that he had recently purchased the DeBary Inn in Summit, New Jersey.\n\nIn the timeframe of 2002 until May 2009 the performance of Cramer's charitable trust \"Action Alerts PLUS\" outpaced the S&P 500 and the Russell 2000; while the charitable trust accumulated a return of 31.75%, the S&P 500 had a return of 18.75% and the Russell 2000 had a return of 22.51%. On an annual basis, the trust outperformed the S&P 500 by 7.35% and the Russell 2000 Index by 3.33%. Paul Bolster explains that Cramer beats the market in part because of the excess risk in his picks. \"If we adjust for his market risk, we come up with an excess return that is essentially zero\", Bolster said, adding that \"zero\", in this case, means his returns are roughly in line with the risk he's taking on. Another criticism of Actions Alerts Plus is that it does not compare itself to indexes that include dividend reinvestment (as the SEC requires for stock-oriented mutual funds). According to a Kiplinger's article \"One recent [Action Alerts PLUS] and included a chart, under the headline \"Action Alert PLUS is CRUSHING the S&P 500,\" showing that the picks returned about 39% from the portfolio's inception through last March 31, compared with 15.5% for the S&P 500 over the same nine-year, three-month period. But the S&P figure did not include reinvested dividends. With them, the S&P 500 returned 38.3%.\"\n\nA study done by Wharton researchers Jonathan Hartley and Matthew Olson found that in the timeframe of August 2001 to March 2016, Cramer's charitable trust underperformed the S&P 500 primarily as a result of underexposure to market returns in years after the 2008 financial crisis. As of March 31, 2016, Cramer's trust since inception had a cumulative return of 64.5% where the S&P 500 fewer dividends returned 70% during the same time frame. Wharton finance professor Robert Stambaugh said he didn't think the findings showed significant underperformance or outperformance when adjusting for a variety of factors, but did state \"It's a commendable attempt to dig more deeply into the style that underlies Cramer's stock picks.\" \n\nCNBC does not permit Cramer to buy or sell any security he has spoken about on CNBC for the trust for five days following the broadcast. Whenever Cramer is acting within his portfolio or important news about his stocks occur, he sends out e-mails to his paying subscribers on TheStreet, Inc. Whenever mentioning a stock that he holds in his portfolio, he is required to disclose that he owns shares of such company on his CNBC show.\n\nIn 2000 Cramer settled a lawsuit with Fox News Channel in which Fox had claimed Cramer reneged on a deal to produce a show for them. Their conflict began when Fox complained that Cramer promoted TheStreet, Inc's stock on the air.\n\nIn March 2007, a December 2006 interview from TheStreet, Inc's \"Wall Street Confidential\" webcast stirred controversy after it appeared on YouTube.com. In the video, Cramer described activities used by hedge fund managers to manipulate stock prices—some of debatable legality and others illegal. He described how he could push stocks higher or lower with as little as $5 million in capital when he was running his hedge fund. Cramer said, \"A lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund ... When I was positioned short—meaning I needed it down—I would create a level of activity beforehand that could drive the futures.\" He also encouraged hedge funds to engage in this type of activity because it is \"a very quick way to make money.\"\n\nCramer stated that everything he did was legal, but that illegal activity is common in the hedge fund industry as well. He also stated that some hedge fund managers spread false rumors to drive a stock down: \"What's important when you are in that hedge-fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful because the truth is so against your view, that it's important to create a new truth, to develop a fiction.\" Cramer described a variety of tactics that hedge fund managers use to affect a stock's price. Cramer said that one strategy to keep a stock price down is to spread false rumors to reporters he described as \"the Pisanis of the world.\" The comment was a reference to CNBC correspondent Bob Pisani, who reports from the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange. \"You have to use these guys,\" said Cramer. He also discussed giving information to \"the bozo reporter from \"The Wall Street Journal\"\" to get an article published. Cramer said this practice, although illegal, is easy to do \"because the SEC doesn't understand it.\" During the interview Cramer referred to himself as a \"banking-class hero.\"\n\nIn February 2006, an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) into allegations of collusion between short-sellers and a stock research firm led to the serving of subpoenas to TheStreet, Inc., and Cramer, as well as journalists for Dow Jones and Marketwatch.com. The SEC then began to back away from the subpoenas, indicating it had no intention of enforcing them after lawyers for Dow Jones said they would not comply. SEC Chairman Christopher Cox rebuked the SEC's staff attorneys for filing subpoenas on two Dow Jones reporters without first consulting him or the other top commissioners. Cox issued a statement saying neither he nor any of the SEC's four other commissioners were aware of the subpoenas, which he called \"highly unusual.\"\n\nThe allegations had been raised publicly and in a lawsuit against Gradient by Overstock.com chief executive Patrick M. Byrne. In May 2007, it was revealed that the SEC had subpoenaed Byrne in May 2006, in connection with an investigation of the company.\n\nCramer is the founder, former owner, and former Senior Partner of Cramer Berkowitz, a hedge fund where Cramer reported a compounded annual \"rate of return of 24% after all fees for 15 years\" at Cramer Berkowitz. He retired from his hedge fund in 2001, where he finished with a self-reported 36% return in 2001. (These returns, however, cannot be independently verified, since hedge funds have no ticker symbols and are not regulated by the SEC. The only source should have been an independent client, who would have invested from day one.)\n\nOn August 3, 2007, Cramer made a plea for Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to cut interest rates supposedly because of comments he was getting from investment banks and their concern about adjustable-rate mortgage borrowers' increasing loan rates.\n\nOn July 8, 2008, in an article in TheStreet.com entitled, \"Look At The Facts,\" Cramer said, \"The losses are increasing, the auction-rate preferreds are now biting, the mortgage implode-a-meter now measures how many home-builders are going under.\"\n\nOn \"Hardball with Chris Matthews\" for September 19, 2008, Cramer stated \"It's not too late to be on the pom-pom ... the sideline\" in regards to home teaser loans. Cramer spoke again on the Today Show on October 6, 2008, suggesting to investors, \"Whatever money you need for the next five years, please take it out of the stock market.\"\n\nOn September 22, 2008, \"Wall Street Journal\" bestselling author Eric Tyson, criticized Cramer's stock picks and his performance in general.\n\nAn August 20, 2007 article in Barrons stated that within the select time frame of the previous two years, \"his picks haven't beaten the market. Over the past two years, viewers holding Cramer's stocks would be up 12% while the Dow rose 22% and the S&P 500 16%.\" CNBC disputed the magazine's findings. In a February 9, 2009, story, Barrons further reported that betting against Cramer's Buy recommendations using options in the short term could yield 25% in the initial month.\n\nOn March 2, 2009, Cramer drew the attention of some critics after his evaluation of President Obama's spending plans and the administration's handling of the banking crisis. Cramer's name came up on March 3, 2009, during a White House press briefing after Cramer said that Obama was responsible for \"the greatest wealth destruction I have seen by a president\". An offended White House administration shot back, with Press Secretary Robert Gibbs stating, \"If you turn on a certain program, it's geared to a very small audience. I'm not entirely sure what he's pointing to make some of the statements.\" When pressed further by NBC's Tom Costello, Gibbs said, \"You can go back and look at any number of statements he's made in the past about the economy and wonder where some of the back-ups for those are, too.\"\n\nOn March 5, 2009, Cramer responded to the White House. He said, \"Huh? Backup? Look at the incredible decline in the stock market, in all indices, since the inauguration of the president, with the drop accelerating when the budget plan came to light because of the massive fear and indecision the document sowed: Raising taxes on the eve of what could be a second Great Depression, destroying the profits in healthcare companies, tinkering with the mortgage deduction at a time when U.S. house price depreciation is behind much of the world's morass and certainly the devastation affecting our banks, and pushing an aggressive cap and trade program that could raise the price of energy for millions of people.\"\n\nCramer questioned criticism he received which he explained makes him \"uncomfortable being in the crosshairs of columnists and comedians I enjoy.\" Cramer asked, \"So, why after toiling in the cable wilderness for four years with \"Mad Money\" am I the target of the wrath of the Obama clan, and the darling, albeit surely momentary, of the Obama-critics? After all, my criticism of Obama's handling of the economic crisis is a lot less pointed than my withering August 2007 'They Know Nothing' meltdown against Ben Bernanke and the previous administration's handling of the economic crisis.\"\n\nReferring to March 8, 2009, charges leveled against Cramer by \"New York Times\" columnist Frank Rich, Cramer said that he does not understand how Obama and his staff plan to raise taxes, institute cap-and-trade limitations and rework the health-care system all during a recession. The article says: \"It isn't that Cramer disagrees with Obama's vision for the country – he even agrees with taxing the rich – but now is not the time to put those plans into action. The president needs to solve our housing, employment and financial problems, and only then turn his attention to health care and changing the mortgage deduction.\"\n\nOn the March 11, 2008, episode of Cramer's show \"Mad Money\", a viewer named Peter submitted the question \"Should I be worried about Bear Stearns in terms of liquidity and get my money out of there?\" Cramer responded \"No! No! No! Bear Stearns is not in trouble. If anything, they're more likely to be \"taken over\". Don't move your money from Bear.\" On March 14, 2008, Bear Stearns stock fell 92% on news of a Fed bailout and $2/share takeover by JPMorgan. On March 17, 2008, Cramer claimed his statements were made in regards to the liquidity of Bear Stearns brokerage accounts as opposed to Bear Stearns common stock. Cramer stated he was not recommending the common stock but allaying concerns about the account holder's liquidity held in a Bear Stearns brokerage account. Cramer later wrote about the incident: \"I did tell an emailer that his deposit in his account at Bear Stearns was safe, but through a clever sound bite, (Jon) Stewart, and subsequently (Frank) Rich—neither of whom have bothered to listen to the context of the pulled quote—pass off the notion of account safety as an out-and-out buy recommendation. The absurdity astounds me. If you called Mad Money and asked me about Citigroup, I would tell you that the common stock might be worthless, but I would never tell you to pull your money out of the bank because I was worried about its solvency. Your money is safe in Citi as I said it was in Bear. The fact that I was right rankles me even more.\"\n\nMichael Lewis, a journalist for the UK-based \"Evening Standard\", states that TheStreet.com listed Bear Stearns as a \"Buy\" at $62 per share on March 11, 2008, which was the same day as the caller's question and a day before the collapse of Bear Stearns. However, TheStreet.com—the web site quote that shows the ratings history for actual changes that Cramer makes—indicates that Cramer changed Bear Stearns rating to a \"Sell\" on February 5, 2008. On his March 12, 2009 appearance on \"The Daily Show\", Cramer admitted he made mistakes on his Bear Stearns calls.\n\nOn March 12, 2009, Cramer appeared on \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\". Stewart reiterated earlier claims regarding the CNBC host's \"silly and/or embarrassing and/or stupid financial observations.\" Moreover, he claimed CNBC shirked its journalistic duty by believing corporate lies, rather than being an investigative \"powerful tool of illumination.\" For his part, Cramer disagreed with Stewart on a few points, but acknowledged that he could have done a better job foreseeing the economic collapse: \"We all should have seen it more.\" \n\nStewart also discussed how short-selling was detrimental to the markets and investors. Cramer admitted to Stewart that short-selling was detrimental, stated his opposition to it, and claimed that he had never engaged in it, which contradicts earlier statements in which he described going short while managing a hedge fund. In a December 2006 interview from TheStreet.com's \"Wall Street Confidential\" webcast Cramer said, \"A lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund. ... When I was positioned short—meaning I needed it down—I would create a level of activity beforehand that could drive the futures.\" He said, \"I will say this: I am trying to expose this stuff, exactly what you guys do, and I've been trying to get the regulators to look at it.\" However, Stewart played several video clips from 2006 where Cramer discussed the spreading of false rumors to drive down stock prices and encouraged short-selling by hedge funds as a means to generate returns. At one point in a clip from December 22, 2006, he said, \"I would encourage anyone in a hedge fund to do it.\" He called it a very quick way to make money and very satisfying. He continued, \"By the way, no one else in the world would ever admit that, but I don't care, and again, I'm not gonna say it on TV.\" Stewart responded, \"I want the Jim Cramer on CNBC to protect me from that Jim Cramer.\" Cramer again admitted that he can do better, and that he should try to change. The interview ended when Stewart pointedly suggested: \"Maybe we can remove the 'financial expert' and the 'In Cramer We Trust' and start getting back to fundamentals on the reporting, as well, and I can go back to making fart noises and funny faces.\" Cramer responded: \"I think we make that deal right here\".\n\n\"The pundits,\" Cramer explained on March 9, 2009, in a MainStreet article, \"who haven't paid attention to anything I have been saying or writing for the past 18 months are all over me.\" Cramer said the pundits \"won't engage in the merits of, say, favoring Tier 1 capital for the banks vs. common equity, or forbearing on the banks to work the situation out over time because the banks can be profitable if we have some patience. They just attack me.\" Cramer suggested, \"It's time to get serious. It's time to take the issue from the pundits and from the left and right, and put it where it belongs: serious non-ideological debate to put out the real firestorm, the collapse of the economy from Wall Street to Main Street and the ensuing Great Wealth Destruction for all.\"\n\nCramer appeared on CNBC on August 3, 2007 and said of the Fed Committee, \"They're nuts. They know nothing. This is a different kinda market. And the Fed is asleep.\" When the transcript from the August 7, 2007 meeting of the Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee was subsequently released on August 28, 2007, it showed that Cramer's comments elicited laughter from participants during a comment from Dennis Lockhart, president, and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. \"I believe that the correct policy posture is to let the markets work through the changes in risk appetite and pricing that are underway, but the market observations of one of my more strident conversational counterparts—and that is not Jim Cramer [laughter]—are worth sharing.\" Continued economic decline in the months that followed—a period that would become known as the Great Recession—and the subsequent rebound in the stock market have left Cramer seemingly vindicated.\n\nOn April 18, 2015, Cramer married Lisa Detwiler in Brooklyn, New York. She is a real estate broker, and is the General Manager of The Longshoreman, a Brooklyn Italian bistro/restaurant.\nCramer has two children from his first marriage.\n\n\n\n"}

Wertheim founded Wertheim & Co. in 1927.\n\nBorn to a Jewish family, the son of Jacob Wertheim of Hartford, Connecticut, and his wife, Hannah Frank of Hoboken, New Jersey, Wertheim was educated at the Sachs School in New York. He then graduated from Harvard University in 1906 with a B.A. and received his M.A. in 1907. In his freshman year, he lived in Matthews Hall in Harvard Yard. He began work at his father's firm, the United Cigar Manufacturers Company. He would later inherit nearly half a million dollars from his father, due to his success with the company. In 1915, he entered into a career as an investment banker in New York, and four years later would become a firm partner of Hallgarten & Company. He founded his own firm Wertheim & Company in 1927, developing a very successful business in mergers and acquisitions, and becoming wealthy in the process. During World War II, he served as a dollar-a-year man on the War Production Board in the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nWertheim served on various boards and as a trustee for various organizations. He was trustee of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, Mount Sinai Hospital, and The Nation. He also served as president of the American Jewish Committee.\n\nWertheim was an amateur chess player and patron of the game. He served as the president of the Manhattan Chess Club, which he assisted financially and took an avid interest in playing correspondence chess. He financed the 1941 U.S. Chess Championship match between Samuel Reshevsky and I.A. Horowitz, which was won by Reshevsky.\n\nWertheim conceived of the idea for the 1946 chess match between the United States and the Soviet Union in Moscow and persuaded the U.S. State Department that it would make a difference in thawing the Cold War. He paid for all the costs, and personally led the team at the tournament.\n\nHe was also actively interested in art, fishing, nature conservancy, and theater. He was an active supporter of the New York Theatre Guild, where he later served as director overseeing the Guild's operations. He acquired of land along the Carmans River on eastern Long Island for personal use to conserve waterfowl and for hunting. In 1947, Wertheim and his then wife, Cecile, donated the entire stretch of land to the United States government for \"the American people\"; the land would eventually become known as the Wertheim National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nWertheim amassed a notable collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works that contained many famous masterpieces, including paintings and sculptures by Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Édouard Manet, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, and Vincent van Gogh. In his will, he arranged for the donation of his collection of French Impressionist paintings to the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University.\n\nAfter his death from a heart attack in 1950, a memorial Maurice Wertheim chess tournament was organized in 1951 in New York in his memory; it was won by Samuel Reshevsky. In 1963, Wertheim's daughter, Barbara, established the Wertheim Study Room in the New York Public Library in honor of her father.\n\nIn 1909, he married Alma Morgenthau, daughter of Henry Morgenthau, Sr.; they had three daughters, Josephine Wertheim Pomerance (b. 1910), historian Barbara W. Tuchman (1912-1989), and Anne Rebe Wertheim Langman (b. 1914). They divorced in 1929. Alma died in 1953. He began his second marriage in March 1930 to Ruth White; they did not have children and divorced in 1935. He was married for a third time in 1944 to Cecile Berlage, who was his spouse until his death; they did not have children. \n\nHis granddaughter, Betsy Ann Langman, was married to film producer Budd Schulberg. His granddaughter, Lynn Langman married attorney and philanthropist, Philip H. Lilienthal, in 1963.\n\n"}

With maximum containment, scientists are able to work safely with pathogens ranging from the most common to the most serious including Ebola, Marburg and Lassa fever.\n\nNML has a second site in Winnipeg, the JC Wilt Infectious Disease Research Centre on Logan Avenue which serves as a hub for HIV research and diagnostics in Canada. The three other primary sites include locations in Guelph, St. Hyacinthe and Lethbridge.\n\nThe National Microbiology Laboratory was preceded by the Bureau of Microbiology which was originally part of the Laboratory Centre for Disease Control of Health Canada in Ottawa. In the 1980s, Health Canada identified both the need to replace existing laboratory space that was reaching the end of its lifespan and the need for Containment Level 4 space in the country. Around the same time, Agriculture Canada (prior to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency being formed) also identified the need for new laboratory space including high-containment. Numerous benefits were identified for housing both laboratories in one building and Winnipeg was chosen as the site; an announcement to that effect was made in October 1987.\n\nAfter some debate, the spot chosen for the site was a city works yard near to the Health Sciences Centre (a major teaching hospital), the University of Manitoba’s medical school, and other life science organizations. Construction of the facility that came to be named the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health (often referred to locally as “the Virology Lab”) began with an official ground-breaking in December 1992. The joint venture design team of Toronto-based Dunlop Architects and Winnipeg-based Smith Carter Architects and Engineers Inc. visited 30 laboratories to seek best practices in containment and design. Construction was largely complete by the end of 1997 with the first programs beginning in the spring of 1998 and all laboratories coming on line after that. The official opening took place in June 1999.\n\nFollowing the SARS outbreak in 2003, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) was formed in 2004 to provide a stronger focus on public health and emergency preparedness in the country. It is a member of the federal Health Portfolio (along with Health Canada, the Canadian Institute of Health Research, and other organizations).\n\nHuman pathogens are classified into risk groups. The criteria to determine the group includes the level of risk to the health of a person or to public health, as well as the likelihood that the human pathogen will actually cause disease in a human, and whether treatment and preventative measures are available. It can depend on the type of work being done as to which level of containment is needed for pathogens from specific risk groups; as an example, culturing (or growing) a virus or bacterium requires higher containment than some diagnostic tests.\n\nNML operates Containment Level 2, 3 and 4 laboratories. In human health infectious disease laboratories, the design and construction of the facility, the engineering controls, and the training and techniques of staff are all focused on protecting lab workers, containing the pathogens, and preventing contamination of materials to ensure accurate diagnosis and research. All of these factors vary depending on the level of containment.\n\nThe vast majority (87.7%) of NML’s lab space is Containment Level 2 (CL2). This is the same type of laboratory found in doctors' offices, hospitals and universities. In a Level 2 lab, work with infectious materials is done inside a biosafety cabinet (BSC) and appropriate personal protective gear is worn relative to activities (gloves, eye protection, lab coats, gowns, etc.). Risk Group 2 pathogens worked with in Level 2 can cause disease but are not a serious hazard and they are often circulating in the community. Environmental contamination must be minimized by the use of hand washing sinks and decontamination facilities such as autoclaves. Examples include E-coli; whooping cough; and seasonal influenza.\n\nNML also has Containment Level 3 (CL3) laboratories (8.6% of lab space). Risk Group 3 pathogens may be transmitted by the airborne route, often need only a low infectious dose to produce effects, and can cause serious or life-threatening disease. CL3 emphasizes additional primary and secondary barriers to minimize the release of infectious organisms into the immediate laboratory and the environment. Additional features to prevent transmission of CL3 organisms are appropriate respiratory protection, HEPA filtration of exhausted laboratory air, and strictly controlled laboratory access. Examples include tuberculosis; West Nile virus; and pandemic H1N1 influenza.\n\nA small percentage of laboratory space (3.6%) is devoted to Containment Level 4 (CL4) at NML. These agents have the potential for aerosol transmission, often have a low infectious dose and produce very serious and often fatal disease; there is no licensed treatment or vaccine available. This level of containment represents an isolated unit independent of other areas. CL4 emphasizes maximum containment of the infectious agent by completely sealing the facility perimeter with confirmation by negative pressure testing; isolation of the researcher from the pathogen by an enclosed positive pressure suit; and decontamination of air and all other materials. Examples include Ebola; Nipah; Marburg; and 1918 pandemic influenza.\n\nNML programs are housed in several facilities across the country. Two of these facilities are in proximity to each other in Winnipeg: The Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health on Arlington Street and the J.C. Wilt Infectious Diseases Research Centre on Logan Avenue. The other facilities are located in Guelph, ON; St. Hyacinthe, QC and Lethbridge, AB.\n\nNML is divided into five main laboratory divisions which are supported by scientific and administrative services. The primary NML divisions are:\n\nBacterial Pathogens - focussing on bacterial diseases such as tuberculosis and antibiotic resistant organisms.\n\nEnteric Diseases - focussing on food and water-borne pathogens including E.coli and Salmonella.\n\nViral Diseases - addressing a range of viral diseases, including hepatitis and other blood-borne pathogens, respiratory viruses and viral exanthemata, such as measles.\n\nZoonotic Diseases and Special Pathogens - dealing with viral, bacterial and rickettsial zoonoses (diseases transmitted to humans from other species), such as West Nile Virus and Lyme disease, along with risk group 4 agents such as Ebola, Marburg and Lassa fever viruses.\n\nHIV and Retrovirology - providing laboratory services and scientific expertise relating to HIV and emerging retroviruses.\n\nThe Science Technology Core and Services Division works with these divisions to provide technological approaches, including genomics, proteomics and bioinformatics.\n\nThere is also the Public Health Risk Sciences Division, which is a specialized resource that provides scientific knowledge and solutions to better assess public health risks and enable decisions, with specific attention to infectious disease threats transmitted from food, the animals, or the physical environment.\n\nThese science-based divisions are complemented and supported by numerous other units that ensure their ongoing operations such as the Office of Science Planning, Program Support and Services, Scientific Informatic Services, Science Support and Client Services, Surveillance and References Services, the Facility and Property Management Division, and the Biorisk and Occupational Safety Services Division. NML also funds the National Reference Centre for Parasitology in Montreal and has a Laboratory Liaison Technical Officer in most provincial labs.\n\nNML employs scientists (MD, PhD, and DVM), biologists, and laboratory technicians, but it also includes informatics specialists, biosafety experts, specialized operations and maintenance staff, and administrative staff, among others. In total, there are approximately 600 staff members as of 2016.\n\nNML is renowned for its work on a broad spectrum of infectious diseases from seasonal influenza to Ebola and its accomplishments are too many to detail.\n\nSome recent examples of the work done by NML include their involvement in the response to the West African Ebola outbreak. For a period of about 18 months, teams from NML travelled to West Africa to aid in the diagnostics during the outbreak. They worked closely with the World Health Organization and Médecins sans frontières to ensure people were properly diagnosed so that they could be properly cared for and isolated from others to stop the spread. Also during this outbreak, a promising vaccine and treatment for Ebola that were developed at NML, in conjunction with collaborators, were fast tracked into clinical trials so that they could get to the people that needed it as soon as possible.\n\nAnother accomplishment was the response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. In April 2009, the Mexican national lab approached NML for assistance with identifying a respiratory virus that was causing outbreaks in Mexico. NML was able to quickly identify the new virus and recognize that it matched the virus that was beginning to circulate in the U.S. As the lead laboratory in Canada, NML rapidly developed diagnostic tests and equipped provincial labs to be able to test for the new virus. NML also assisted Mexico by providing additional testing and sent staff to their national laboratory to enable to help them set up their own testing protocols.\n\nIn the international laboratory sector, NML has developed different types of mobile labs: a lab-truck, a lab-trailer, and a “lab in a suitcase.” The lab-truck is generally used for in-country deployments at high-profile events such as the 2010 Olympics, the lab-trailer is used for international large-scale events where there may be a threat of bio-terrorism or other deliberate acts involving infectious agents, and the lab in a suitcase is frequently used in remote areas of the world with little available infrastructure. An example would be the multiple deployments over the years to combat outbreaks of Ebola in Africa. This model was adopted by many other countries during the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n\nNML houses the secretariats for both the Canadian Public Health Laboratory Network (CPHLN) and the Global Health Security Action Group – Laboratory Network (GHSAG-LN). The role of CPHLN is to provide a forum for public health laboratory leaders to share knowledge. The GHSAG-LN network’s goals are to coordinate the diagnostic capabilities of all participants and contribute to disease surveillance around the world.\n\nThe Canadian Network for Public Health Intelligence (CNPHI) is an innovation developed by NML staff. It is a secure web-based system that compiles information from various surveillance systems and issues alerts to users. More than 4,000 public health officials across Canada now subscribe to it. CNPHI tools assist in determining the existence or extent of an outbreak through the recognition of related cases across jurisdictions.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2014, Dr. Frank Plummer was the Scientific Director General of the National Microbiology Laboratory. Under Dr. Plummer's guidance, the NML developed into one of the world's premier institutions in the research, detection, and response to global infectious disease and bio-security threats.\n\nDr. Plummer received his medical degree from the University of Manitoba in 1976. Between 1984 and 2001, Dr. Plummer lived in Nairobi, Kenya where he spearheaded the development of the world renowned \"Kenya AIDS Control Program,\" established by the Universities of Manitoba and Nairobi. This HIV epidemiological work was central to global understanding of the risk factors for HIV transmission and how to prevent its spread. Dr. Plummer was the first to reveal that heterosexual women could also be infected with HIV/AIDS and that a cohort of Nairobi sex workers had a natural immunity to HIV/AIDS. This latter discovery suggested the possibility that a vaccine could eventually be developed.\n\nDr. Plummer stepped down as the NML’s Scientific Director General to take the position as senior adviser to the Agency's Chief Public Health Officer in 2014. He continues to be a distinguished professor at the University of Manitoba and a Canada Research Chair.\n\nIn 2015, Dr. Matthew Gilmour became the Scientific Director General of the National Microbiology Laboratory and the Laboratory for Foodborne Zoonoses. Dr. Gilmour spearheaded the partnership that brought these two laboratories together under the National Microbiology Laboratory umbrella. He was previously the Chief, Enteric Diseases and subsequently the Program Director, Bacteriology and Enteric Diseases at the NML.\n\nDr. Gilmour has won a number of scientific awards including Canadian Society of Microbiologists’ Canadian Graduate Student Microbiologist of the Year Award; the Public Health Agency of Canada’s Most Promising Researcher Merit Award and Dr. Andrés Petrasovits Public Health Merit Award; and Health Canada’s Excellence Award in Collaborative Leadership and Award for Excellence in Science. Dr. Gilmour continues to be an Assistant Professor at the University of Manitoba’s Department of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases as well as the Secretary Treasurer of the Canadian Association for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (CACMID).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "183515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=183515", "title": "Retail", "text": "Retail\n\nRetail is the process of selling consumer goods or services to customers through multiple channels of distribution to earn a profit. Retailers satisfy demand identified through a supply chain. The term \"retailer\" is typically applied where a service provider fills the small orders of a large number of individuals, who are end-users, rather than large orders of a small number of wholesale, corporate or government clientele. Shopping generally refers to the act of buying products. Sometimes this is done to obtain final goods, including necessities such as food and clothing; sometimes it takes place as a recreational activity. Recreational shopping often involves window shopping and browsing: it does not always result in a purchase.\n\nRetail markets and shops have a very ancient history, dating back to antiquity. Some of the earliest retailers were itinerant peddlers. Over the centuries, retail shops were transformed from little more than \"rude booths\" to the sophisticated shopping malls of the modern era.\n\nMost modern retailers typically make a variety of strategic level decisions including the type of store, the market to be served, the optimal product assortment, customer service, supporting services and the store's overall market positioning. Once the strategic retail plan is in place, retailers devise the retail mix which includes product, price, place, promotion, personnel and presentation. In the digital age, an increasing number of retailers are seeking to reach broader markets by selling through multiple channels, including both bricks and mortar and online retailing. Digital technologies are also changing the way that consumers pay for goods and services. Retailing support services may also include the provision of credit, delivery services, advisory services, stylist services and a range of other supporting services.\n\nRetail shops occur in a diverse range of types and in many different contexts – from strip shopping centres in residential streets through to large, indoor shopping malls. Shopping streets may restrict traffic to pedestrians only. Sometimes a shopping street has a partial or full roof to create a more comfortable shopping environment – protecting customers from various types of weather conditions such as extreme temperatures, winds or precipitation. Forms of non-shop retailing include online retailing (a type of electronic-commerce used for business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions) and mail order.\n\nRetail comes from the Old French word \"tailler\", which means \"to cut off, clip, pare, divide\" in terms of tailoring (1365). It was first recorded as a noun with the meaning of a \"sale in small quantities\" in 1433 (from the Middle French \"retail\", \"piece cut off, shred, scrap, paring\"). As in the French, the word, \"retail\", in both Dutch and German, also refers to the sale of small quantities of items.\n\nRetail refers to the activity of reselling. A retailer is any person or organisation is a reseller who sells goods or services directly to consumers or end-users. Some retailers may sell to business customers, and such sales are termed \"non-retail activity.\" In some jurisdictions or regions, legal definitions of retail specify that at least 80 percent of sales activity must be to end-users.\n\nRetailing often occurs in retail stores or service establishments, but may also occur through direct selling such as through vending machines, door-to-door sales or electronic channels.\nAlthough the idea of retail is often associated with the purchase of goods, the term may be applied to service-providers that sell to consumers. Retail service providers include retail banking, tourism, insurance, private healthcare, private education, private security firms, legal firms, publishers, public transport and others. For example, a tourism provider might have a retail division that books travel and accommodation for consumers plus a wholesale division that purchases blocks of accommodation, hospitality, transport and sightseeing which are subsequently packaged into a holiday tour for sale to retail travel agents.\n\nSome retailers badge their stores as \"wholesale outlets\" offering \"wholesale prices.\" While this practice may encourage consumers to imagine that they have access to lower prices, while being prepared to trade-off reduced prices for cramped in-store environments, in a strict legal sense, a store that sells the majority of its merchandise direct to consumers, is defined as a retailer rather than a wholesaler. Different jurisdictions set parameters for the ratio of consumer to business sales that define a retail business.\n\nRetail markets have existed since ancient times. Archaeological evidence for trade, probably involving barter systems, dates back more than 10,000 years. As civilizations grew, barter was replaced with retail trade involving coinage. Selling and buying is thought to have emerged in Asia Minor (modern Turkey) in around the 7th millennium BCE. Gharipour points to evidence of primitive shops and trade centres in Sialk Hills in Kashan (6000 BCE), Catalk Huyuk in modern-day Turkey (7,500–5,700 BCE), Jericho (2600 BCE) and Susa (4000 BCE). Open air, public markets were known in ancient Babylonia, Assyria, Phoenicia and Egypt. These markets typically occupied a place in the town's centre. Surrounding the market, skilled artisans, such as metal-workers and leather workers, occupied permanent premises in alleys that led to the open market-place. These artisans may have sold wares directly from their premises, but also prepared goods for sale on market days. In ancient Greece markets operated within the agora, an open space where, on market days, goods were displayed on mats or temporary stalls. In ancient Rome, trade took place in the forum. Rome had two forums; the Forum Romanum and Trajan's Forum. The latter was a vast expanse, comprising multiple buildings with shops on four levels. The Roman forum was arguably the earliest example of a permanent retail shop-front. In antiquity, exchange involved direct selling via merchants or peddlers and bartering systems were commonplace.\n\nThe Phoenicians, noted for their seafaring skills, plied their ships across the Mediterranean, becoming a major trading power by the 9th century BCE. The Phoenicians imported and exported wood, textiles, glass and produce such as wine, oil, dried fruit and nuts. Their trading skills necessitated a network of colonies along the Mediterranean coast, stretching from modern day Crete through to Tangiers and onto Sardinia The Phoenicians not only traded in tangible goods, but were also instrumental in transporting culture. The Phoenician's extensive trade networks necessitated considerable book-keeping and correspondence. In around 1500 BCE, the Phoenicians developed a consonantal alphabet which was much easier to learn that the complex scripts used in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. Phoenician traders and merchants were largely responsible for spreading their alphabet around the region. Phoenician inscriptions have been found in archaeological sites at a number of former Phoenician cities and colonies around the Mediterranean, such as Byblos (in present-day Lebanon) and Carthage in North Africa.\n\nIn the Graeco-Roman world, the market primarily served the local peasantry. Local producers, who were generally poor, would sell small surpluses from their individual farming activities, purchase minor farm equipment and also buy a few luxuries for their homes. Major producers such as the great estates were sufficiently attractive for merchants to call directly at their farm-gates, obviating the producers' need to attend local markets. The very wealthy landowners managed their own distribution, which may have involved exporting and importing. The nature of export markets in antiquity is well documented in ancient sources and archaeological case studies. The Romans preferred to purchase goods from specific places: oysters from Londinium, cinnamon from a specific mountain in Arabia, and these place-based preferences stimulated trade throughout Europe and the middle East. Markets were also important centres of social life.\n\nThe rise of retailing and marketing in England and Europe has been extensively studied, but less is known about developments elsewhere. Nevertheless, recent research suggests that China exhibited a rich history of early retail systems. From as early as 200 BCE, Chinese packaging and branding was used to signal family, place names and product quality, and the use of government imposed product branding was used between 600 and 900 CE. Eckhart and Bengtsson have argued that during the Song Dynasty (960–1127), Chinese society developed a consumerist culture, where a high level of consumption was attainable for a wide variety of ordinary consumers rather than just the elite. The rise of a consumer culture led to the commercial investment in carefully managed company image, retail signage, symbolic brands, trademark protection and sophisticated brand concepts.\n\nIn Medieval England and Europe, relatively few permanent shops were to be found; instead customers walked into the tradesman's workshops where they discussed purchasing options directly with tradesmen. In 13th century London, mercers and haberdashers were known to exist and grocers sold \"miscellaneous small wares as well as spices and medicines\" but fish and other perishables were sold through markets, costermongers, hucksters, peddlers or other type of itinerant vendor.\n\nIn the more populous cities, a small number of shops were beginning to emerge by the 13th century. In Chester, a medieval covered shopping arcade represented a major innovation that attracted shoppers from many miles around. Known as \"The Rows\" this medieval shopping arcade is believed to be the first of its kind in Europe. Fragments of Chester's Medieval Row, which is believed to date to the mid-13th century, can still be found in Cheshire. In the 13th or 14th century, another arcade with several shops was recorded at \"Drapery Row\" in Winchester. The emergence of street names such as \"Drapery Row\", \"Mercer's Lane\" and \"Ironmonger Lane\" in the medieval period suggests that permanent shops were becoming more commonplace.\n\nMedieval shops had little in common with their modern equivalent. As late as the 16th century, London's shops were described as little more than \"rude booths\" and their owners \"bawled as loudly as the itinerants.\" Shopfronts typically had a front door with two wider openings on either side, each covered with shutters. The shutters were designed to open so that the top portion formed a canopy while the bottom was fitted with legs so that it could serve as a shopboard. Cox and Dannehl suggest that the Medieval shopper's experience was very different. Glazed windows, which were rare during the medieval period, and did not become commonplace until the eighteenth century, meant that shop interiors were dark places. Outside the markets, goods were rarely out on display and the service counter was unknown. Shoppers had relatively few opportunities to inspect the merchandise prior to consumption. Many stores had openings onto the street from which they served customers.\n\nOutside the major cities, most consumable purchases were made through markets or fairs. Markets were held daily in the more populous towns and cities or weekly in the more sparsely populated rural districts. Markets sold fresh produce; fruit, vegetables, baked goods, meat, poultry, fish and some ready to eat foodstuffs; while fairs operated on a periodic cycle and were almost always associated with a religious festival. Fairs sold non-perishables such as farm tools, homewares, furniture, rugs and ceramics. Market towns dotted the medieval European landscape while itinerant vendors supplied less populated areas or hard-to-reach districts. Peddlers and other itinerant vendors operated alongside other types of retail for centuries. The political philosopher, John Stuart Mill compared the convenience of markets/fairs to that of the itinerant peddlers:\n\nBlintiff has investigated the early Medieval networks of market towns across Europe, and suggests that by the 12th century there was an upsurge in the number of market towns and the emergence of merchant circuits as traders bulked up surpluses from smaller regional, different day markets and resold them at the larger centralised market towns. Market-places appear to have emerged independently outside Europe. The Grand Bazaar in Istanbul is often cited as the world's oldest continuously-operating market; its construction began in 1455. The Spanish conquistadors wrote glowingly of markets in the Americas. In the 15th century the Mexica (Aztec) market of Tlatelolco was the largest in all the Americas.\n\nEnglish market towns were regulated from a relatively early period. The English monarchs awarded a \"charter\" to local Lords to create markets and fairs for a town or village. This charter would grant the lords the right to take tolls and also afford some protection from rival markets. For example, once a chartered market was granted for specific market days, a nearby rival market could not open on the same days. Across the boroughs of England, a network of chartered markets sprang up between the 12th and 16th centuries, giving consumers reasonable choice in the markets they preferred to patronise. A study on the purchasing habits of the monks and other individuals in medieval England, suggests that consumers of the period were relatively discerning. Purchase decisions were based on purchase criteria such as consumers' perceptions of the range, quality, and price of goods. This informed decisions about where to make their purchases and which markets were superior. Today, traders and showmen jealously guard the reputation of these historic market charters.\n\nBraudel and Reynold have made a systematic study of these European market towns between the thirteenth and fifteenth century. Their investigation shows that in regional districts markets were held once or twice a week while daily markets were common in larger cities. Gradually over time, permanent shops with regular trading days began to supplant the periodic markets, while peddlers filled in the gaps in distribution. The physical market was characterised by transactional exchange and the economy was characterised by local trading. Braudel reports that, in 1600, goods travelled relatively short distances – grain 5–10 miles; cattle 40–70 miles; wool and woollen cloth 20–40 miles. Following the European age of discovery, goods were imported from afar – calico cloth from India, porcelain, silk and tea from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum and coffee from the New World.\n\nEnglish essayist, Joseph Addison, writing in 1711, described the exotic origin of produce available to English society in the following terms:\n\nLuca Clerici has made a detailed study of Vicenza’s food market during the sixteenth century. He found that there were many different types of reseller operating out of the markets. For example, in the dairy trade, cheese and butter was sold by the members of two craft guilds (i.e., cheesemongers who were shopkeepers) and that of the so-called ‘resellers’ (hucksters selling a wide range of foodstuffs), and by other sellers who were not enrolled in any guild. Cheesemongers’ shops were situated at the town hall and were very lucrative. Resellers and direct sellers increased the number of sellers, thus increasing competition, to the benefit of consumers. Direct sellers, who brought produce from the surrounding countryside, sold their wares through the central market place and priced their goods at considerably lower rates than cheesemongers.\n\nBy the 17th century, permanent shops with more regular trading hours were beginning to supplant markets and fairs as the main retail outlet. Provincial shopkeepers were active in almost every English market town. These shopkeepers sold general merchandise, much like a contemporary convenience store or a general store. For example, William Allen, a mercer in Tamworth who died in 1604, sold spices alongside furs and fabrics. William Stout of Lancaster retailed sugar, tobacco, nails and prunes at both his shop and at the central markets. His autobiography reveals that he spent most of his time preparing products for sale at the central market, which brought an influx of customers into town.\n\nAs the number of shops grew, they underwent a transformation. The trappings of a modern shop, which had been entirely absent from the sixteenth and early seventeenth century store, gradually made way for store interiors and shopfronts that are more familiar to modern shoppers. Prior to the eighteenth century, the typical retail store had no counter, display cases, chairs, mirrors, changing-rooms, etc. However, the opportunity for the customer to browse merchandise, touch and feel products began to be available, with retail innovations from the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Glazing was widely used from the early 18th-century. English commentators pointed to the speed at which glazing was installed, Daniel Defoe, writing in 1726, noted that \"Never was there such painting and guildings, such sashings and looking-glasses as the shopkeepers as there is now.\"\n\nOutside the major metropolitan cities, few stores could afford to serve one type of clientele exclusively. However, gradually retail shops introduced innovations that would allow them to separate wealthier customers from the \"riff raff.\" One technique was to have a window opening out onto the street from which customers could be served. This allowed the sale of goods to the common people, without encouraging them to come inside. Another solution, that came into vogue from the late sixteenth century was to invite favoured customers into a back-room of the store, where goods were permanently on display. Yet another technique that emerged around the same time was to hold a showcase of goods in the shopkeeper's private home for the benefit of wealthier clients. Samuel Pepys, for example, writing in 1660, describes being invited to the home of a retailer to view a wooden jack. The eighteenth century English entrepreneurs, Josiah Wedgewood and Matthew Boulton, both staged expansive showcases of their wares in their private residences or in rented halls.\n\nSavitt has argued that by the eighteenth century, American merchants, who had been operating as importers and exporters, began to specialise in either wholesale or retail roles. They tended not to specialise in particular types of merchandise, often trading as general merchants, selling a diverse range of product types. These merchants were concentrated in the larger cities. They often provided high levels of credit financing for retail transactions.\n\nBy the late eighteenth century, grand shopping arcades began to emerge across Europe and in the Antipodes. A shopping arcade refers to a multiple-vendor space, operating under a covered roof. Typically, the roof was constructed of glass to allow for natural light and to reduce the need for candles or electric lighting. Some of the earliest examples of shopping arcade appeared in Paris, due its lack of pavement for pedestrians. Retailers, eager to attract window shoppers by providing a shopping environment away from the filthy streets, began to construct rudimentary arcades. Opening in 1771, the \"Coliseé\", situated on the Champs Elysee, consisted of three arcades, each with ten shops, all running off a central ballroom. For Parisians, the location was seen as too remote and the arcade closed within two years of opening. Inspired by the souks of Arabia, the Galerie de Bois, a series of wooden shops linked the ends of the Palais Royal, opened in 1786 and became a central part of Parisian social life.\n\nThe architect, Bertrand Lemoine, described the period, 1786 to 1935, as \"l’Ère des passages couverts\" (the Arcade Era). In the European capitals, shopping arcades spread across the continent, reaching their heyday in the early 19th century: the Palais Royal in Paris (opened in 1784); Passage de Feydeau in Paris (opened in 1791) and Passage du Claire in 1799. London's Piccadilly Arcade (opened in 1810); Paris's Passage Colbert (1826) and Milan's Galleria Vittorio Emanuele (1878). Designed to attract the genteel middle class, arcade retailers sold luxury goods at relatively high prices. However, prices were never a deterrent, as these new arcades came to be the place to shop and to be seen. Arcades offered shoppers the promise of an enclosed space away from the chaos that characterised the noisy, dirty streets; a warm, dry space away from the elements, and a safe-haven where people could socialise and spend their leisure time. As thousands of glass covered arcades spread across Europe, they became grander and more ornately decorated. By the mid nineteenth century, they had become prominent centres of fashion and social life. Promenading in these arcades became a popular nineteenth century pass-time for the emerging middle classes. The \"Illustrated Guide to Paris\" of 1852 summarized the appeal of arcades in the following description:\n\nThe Palais-Royal, which opened to Parisians in 1784 and became one of the most important marketplaces in Paris, is generally regarded as the earliest example in the grand shopping arcades. The Palais-Royal was a complex of gardens, shops and entertainment venues situated on the external perimeter of the grounds, under the original colonnades. The area boasted some 145 boutiques, cafés, salons, hair salons, bookshops, museums, and numerous refreshment kiosks as well as two theatres. The retail outlets specialised in luxury goods such as fine jewellery, furs, paintings and furniture designed to appeal to the wealthy elite. Retailers operating out of the Palais complex were among the first in Europe to abandon the system of bartering, and adopt fixed-prices thereby sparing their clientele the hassle of bartering. Stores were fitted with long glass exterior windows which allowed the emerging middle-classes to window shop and indulge in fantasies, even when they may not have been able to afford the high retail prices. Thus, the Palais-Royal became one of the first examples of a new style of shopping arcade, frequented by both the aristocracy and the middle classes. It developed a reputation as being a site of sophisticated conversation, revolving around the salons, cafés, and bookshops, but also became a place frequented by off-duty soldiers and was a favourite haunt of prostitutes, many of whom rented apartments in the building. London's Burlington Arcade, which opened in 1819, positioned itself as an elegant and exclusive venue from the outset. Other notable nineteenth century grand arcades include the Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert in Brussels which was inaugurated in 1847, Istanbul's Çiçek Pasajı opened in 1870 and Milan's Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II first opened in 1877. Shopping arcades were the precursor to the modern shopping mall.\nWhile the arcades were the province of the bourgeoisie, a new type of retail venture emerged to serve the needs of the working poor. John Stuart Mill wrote about the rise of the co-operative retail store, which he witnessed first-hand in the mid-nineteenth century. Stuart Mill locates these co-operative stores within a broader co-operative movement which was prominent in the industrial city of Manchester and in the counties of Yorkshire and Lancashire. He documents one of the early co-operative retail stores in Rochdale in Manchester, England, \"In 1853, the Store purchased for £745, a warehouse (freehold) on the opposite side of the street, where they keep and retail their stores of flour, butcher's meat, potatoes, and kindred articles.\" Stuart Mill also quoted a contemporary commentator who wrote of the benefits of the co-operative store:\n\nBuyer and seller meet as friends; there is no overreaching on one side, and no suspicion on the other... These crowds of humble working men, who never knew before when they put good food in their mouths, whose every dinner was adulterated, whose shoes let in the water a month too soon, whose waistcoats shone with devil's dust, and whose wives wore calico that would not wash, now buy in the markets like millionaires, and as far as pureness of food goes, live like lords.\n\nThe modern era of retailing is defined as the period from the industrial revolution to the 21st-century. In major cities, the department store emerged in the mid to late 19th-century, and permanently reshaped shopping habits, and redefined concepts of service and luxury. The term, \"department store\" originated in America. In 19th century England, these stores were known as emporia or warehouse shops. In London, the first department stores appeared in Oxford Street and Regent Street, where they formed part of a distinctly modern shopping precinct. When London draper, William Whiteley attempted to transform his Bayswater drapery store into a department store by adding a meat and vegetable department and an Oriental Department in around 1875, he met with extreme resistance from other shop-keepers, who resented that he was encroaching on their territory and poaching their customers. Before long, however, major department stores began to open across the US, Britain and Europe from the mid-nineteenth century including; Harrod's of London in 1834; Kendall's in Manchester in 1836; Selfridges of London in 1909; Macy's of New York in 1858; Bloomingdale's in 1861; Sak's in 1867; J.C. Penney in 1902; Le Bon Marché of France in 1852 and Galeries Lafayette of France in 1905. Other twentieth century innovations in retailing included chain stores, mail-order, multi-level marketing (pyramid selling or network marketing, 1920s), party plans ( 1930s) and B2C e-commerce.\n\nMany of the early department stores were more than just a retail emporium; rather they were venues where shoppers could spend their leisure time and be entertained. Some department stores offered reading rooms, art galleries and concerts. Most department stores had tea-rooms or dining rooms and offered treatment areas where ladies could indulge in a manicure. The fashion show, which originated in the US in around 1907, became a staple feature event for many department stores and celebrity appearances were also used to great effect. Themed events featured wares from foreign shores, exposing shoppers to the exotic cultures of the Orient and Middle-East.\nDuring this period, retailers worked to develop modern retail marketing practices. Pioneering merchants who contributed to modern retail marketing and management methods include: A. T. Stewart, Potter Palmer, John Wanamaker, Montgomery Ward, Marshall Field, Richard Warren Sears, Rowland Macy, J.C. Penney, Fred Lazarus, brothers Edward and William Filene and Sam Walton.\n\nRetail, using mail order, came of age during the mid-19th century. Although catalogue sales had been used since the 15th century, this method of retailing was confined to a few industries such as the sale of books and seeds. However, improvements in transport and postal services, led several entrepreneurs on either side of the Atlantic to experiment with catalogue sales. In 1861, Welsh draper Pryce Pryce-Jones sent catalogues to clients who could place orders for flannel clothing which was then despatched by post. This enabled Pryce-Jones to extend his client base across Europe. A decade later, the US retailer, Montgomery Ward also devised a catalogue sales and mail-order system. His first catalogue which was issued in August 1872 consisted of an 8 in × 12 in (20 cm × 30 cm) single-sheet price list, listing 163 items for sale with ordering instructions for which Ward had written the copy. He also devised the catch-phrase \"satisfaction guaranteed or your money back\" which was implemented in 1875. By the 1890s, Sears and Roebuck were also using mail order with great success.\n\nEdward Filene, a proponent of the scientific approach to retail management, developed the concept of the \"automatic bargain Basement\". Although Filene's basement was not the first ‘bargain basement’ in the U.S., the principles of ‘automatic mark-downs’ generated excitement and proved very profitable. Under Filene's plan, merchandise had to be sold within 30 days or it was marked down; after a further 12 days, the merchandise was further reduced by 25% and if still unsold after another 18 days, a further markdown of 25% was applied. If the merchandise remained unsold after two months, it was given to charity. Filene was a pioneer in employee relations. He instituted a profit sharing program, a minimum wage for women, a 40-hour work week, health clinics and paid vacations. He also played an important role in encouraging the Filene Cooperative Association, \"perhaps the earliest American company union\". Through this channel he engaged constructively with his employees in collective bargaining and arbitration processes.\n\nIn the post-war period, an American architect, Victor Gruen developed a concept for a shopping mall; a planned, self-contained shopping complex complete with an indoor plaza, statues, planting schemes, piped music, and car-parking. Gruen's vision was to create a shopping atmosphere where people felt so comfortable, they would spend more time in the environment, thereby enhancing opportunities for purchasing. The first of these malls opened at Northland Mall near Detroit in 1954. He went on to design some 50 such malls. Due to the success of the mall concept, Gruen was described as \"the most influential architect of the twentieth century by a journalist in the New Yorker.\"\n\nThroughout the twentieth century, a trend towards larger store footprints became discernible. The average size of a U.S. supermarket grew from square feet in 1991 to square feet in 2000. In 1963, Carrefour opened the first hypermarket in St Genevieve-de-Bois, near Paris, France. By the end of the twentieth century, stores were using labels such as \"mega-stores\" and \"warehouse\" stores to reflect their growing size. In Australia, for example, the popular hardware chain, Bunnings has shifted from smaller \"home centres\" (retail floor space under ) to \"warehouse\" stores (retail floor space between and ) in order to accommodate a wider range of goods and in response to population growth and changing consumer preferences. The upward trend of increasing retail space was not consistent across nations, and led in the early 21st century to a 2-fold difference in square footage per capita between the United States and Europe.\n\nAs the 21st century takes shape, some indications suggest that large retail stores have come under increasing pressure from online sales models and that reductions in store size are evident. Under such competition and other issues such as business debt, there has been a noted business disruption called the retail apocalypse in recent years which several retail businesses, especially in North America, are sharply reducing their number of stores, or going out of business entirely.\n\nThe distinction between \"strategic\" and \"managerial\" decision-making is commonly used to distinguish \"two phases having different goals and based on different conceptual tools. Strategic planning concerns the choice of policies aiming at improving the competitive position of the firm, taking account of challenges and opportunities proposed by the competitive environment. On the other hand, managerial decision-making is focused on the implementation of specific targets.\"\n\nIn retailing, the strategic plan is designed to set out the vision and provide guidance for retail decision-makers and provide an outline of how the product and service mix will optimize customer satisfaction. As part of the strategic planning process, it is customary for strategic planners to carry out a detailed environmental scan which seeks to identify trends and opportunities in the competitive environment, market environment, economic environment and statutory-political environment. The retail strategy is normally devised or reviewed every 3– 5 years by the chief executive officer.\n\nThe strategic retail analysis typically includes following elements:\n\nAt the conclusion of the retail analysis, the retail marketers should have a clear idea of which groups of customers are to be the target of marketing activities. Retail research studies suggest that there is a strong relationship between a store's positioning and the socio-economic status of customers. In addition, the retail strategy, including service quality, has a significant and positive association with customer loyalty. A marketing strategy effectively outlines all key aspects of firms' targeted audience, demographics, preferences. In a highly competitive market, the retail strategy sets up long-term sustainability. It focuses on customer relationships, stressing the importance of added value, customer satisfaction and highlights how the store's market positioning appeals to targeted groups of customers.\n\nSee also product management; promotion mix; marketing mix; price; servicescapes and retail design\n\nOnce the strategic plan is in place, retail managers turn to the more managerial aspects of planning. A retail mix is devised for the purpose of coordinating day-to-day tactical decisions. The retail marketing mix typically consists of six broad decision layers including product decisions, place decisions, promotion, price, personnel and presentation (also known as physical evidence). The retail mix is loosely based on the marketing mix, but has been expanded and modified in line with the unique needs of the retail context. A number of scholars have argued for an expanded marketing, mix with the inclusion of two new Ps, namely, \"Personnel\" and \"Presentation\" since these contribute to the customer's unique retail experience and are the principal basis for retail differentiation. Yet other scholars argue that the \"Retail Format\" (i.e. retail formula) should be included. The modified retail marketing mix that is most commonly cited in text-books is often called the \"6 Ps of retailing\" (see diagram at right).\n\nSee Product management\n\nThe primary product-related decisions facing the retailer are the product assortment (what product lines, how many lines and which brands to carry); the type of customer service (high contact through to self-service) and the availability of support services (e.g. credit terms, delivery services, after sales care). These decisions depend on careful analysis of the market, demand, competition as well as the retailer's skills and expertise.\n\nThe term product assortment refers to the combination of both product breadth and depth. The main characteristics of a company's product assortment are:\n\nFor a retailer, finding the right balance between breadth and depth can be a key to success. An average supermarket might carry 30,000–60,000 different product lines (product length or assortment), but might carry up to 100 different types of toothpaste (product depth). Speciality retailers typically carry fewer product lines, perhaps as few as 20 lines, but will normally stock greater depth. Costco, for example, carries 5,000 different lines while Aldi carries just 1,400 lines per store.\n\nLarge assortments offer consumers many benefits, notably increased choice and the possibility that the consumer will be able to locate the ideal product. However, for the retailer, larger assortments incur costs in terms of record-keeping, managing inventory, pricing and risks associated with wastage due to spoiled, shopworn or unsold stock. Carrying more stock also exposes the retailer to higher risks in terms of slow-moving stock and lower sales per square foot of store space. On the other hand, reducing the number of product lines can generate cost savings through increased stock turnover by eliminating slow-moving lines, fewer stockouts, increased bargaining power with suppliers, reduced costs associated with wastage and carrying inventory, and higher sales per square foot which means more efficient space utilisation.\n\nWhen determining the number of product lines to carry, the retailer must consider the store type, store's physical storage capacity, the perishability of items, expected turnover rates for each line and the customer's needs and expectations.\n\nCustomer service is the \"sum of acts and elements that allow consumers to receive what they need or desire from [the] retail establishment.\" Retailers must decide whether to provide a full service outlet or minimal service outlet, such as no-service in the case of vending machines; self-service with only basic sales assistance or a full service operation as in many boutiques and speciality stores. In addition, the retailer needs to make decisions about sales support such as customer delivery and after sales customer care.\n\nRetailing services may also include the provision of credit, delivery services, advisory services, exchange/ return services, product demonstration, special orders, customer loyalty programs, limited-scale trial, advisory services and a range of other supporting services. Retail stores often seek to differentiate along customer service lines. For example, some department stores offer the services of a \"stylist\"; a fashion advisor, to assist customers selecting a fashionable wardrobe for the forthcoming season, while smaller boutiques may allow regular customers to take goods home \"on approval\", enabling the customer to try out goods before making the final purchase. The variety of supporting services offered is known as the \"service type.\" At one end of the spectrum, self-service operators offer few basic support services. At the other end of the spectrum, full-service operators offer a broad range of highly personalised customer services to augment the retail experience.\n\nWhen making decisions about customer service, the retailer must balance the customer's desire for full-service against the customer's willingness to pay for the cost of delivering supporting services. Self-service is a very cost efficient way of delivering services since the retailer harnesses the customers labour power to carry out many of the retail tasks. However, many customers appreciate full service and are willing to pay a premium for the benefits of full-service.\n\nA sales assistant's role typically includes greeting customers, providing product and service-related information, providing advice about products available from current stock, answering customer questions, finalising customer transactions and if necessary, providing follow-up service necessary to ensure customer satisfaction. For retail store owners, it is extremely important to train personnel with the requisite skills necessary to deliver excellent customer service. Such skills may include product knowledge, inventory management, handling cash and credit transactions, handling product exchange and returns, dealing with difficult customers and of course, a detailed knowledge of store policies. The provision of excellent customer service creates more opportunities to build enduring customer relationships with the potential to turn customers into sources of referral or retail advocates. In the long term, excellent customer service provides businesses with an ongoing reputation and may lead to a competitive advantage. Customer service is essential for several reasons. Firstly, customer service contributes to the customer's overall retail experience. Secondly, evidence suggests that a retail organization which trains its employees in appropriate customer service benefits more than those who do not. Customer service training entails instructing personnel in the methods of servicing the customer that will benefit corporations and businesses. It is important to establish a bond amongst customers-employees known as Customer relationship management.\n\nThere are several ways the retailer can deliver services to consumers:\n\nPlace decisions are primarily concerned with consumer access and may involve location, space utilisation and operating hours.\n\nAlso see Site selection\n\nRetail stores are typically located where market opportunities are optimal – high traffic areas, central business districts. Selecting the right site can be a major success factor. When evaluating potential sites, retailers often carry out a \"trade area analysis\"; a detailed analysis designed to approximate the potential patronage area. Techniques used in trade area analysis include: Radial (ring) studies; Gravity models and Drive time analyses.\n\nIn addition, retailers may consider a range of both qualitative and quantitative factors to evaluate to potential sites under consideration:\n\nA major retail trend has been the shift to multi-channel retailing. To counter the disruption caused by online retail, many bricks and mortar retailers have entered the online retail space, by setting up online catalogue sales and e-commerce websites. However, many retailers have noticed that consumers behave differently when shopping online. For instance, in terms of choice of online platform, shoppers tend to choose the online site of their preferred retailer initially, but as they gain more experience in online shopping, they become less loyal and more likely to switch to other retail sites. Online stores are usually available 24 hours a day, and many consumers in Western countries have Internet access both at work and at home.\n\nSee also Pricing Strategies\n\nThe broad pricing strategy is normally established in the company's overall strategic plan. In the case of chain stores, the pricing strategy would be set by head office. Broadly, there are six approaches to pricing strategy mentioned in the marketing literature:\n\nWhen decision-makers have determined the broad approach to pricing (i.e., the pricing strategy), they turn their attention to pricing tactics. Tactical pricing decisions are shorter term prices, designed to accomplish specific short-term goals. The tactical approach to pricing may vary from time to time, depending on a range of internal considerations (e.g. the need to clear surplus inventory) or external factors (e.g. a response to competitive pricing tactics). Accordingly, a number of different pricing tactics may be employed in the course of a single planning period or across a single year. Typically store managers have the necessary latitude to vary prices on individual lines provided that they operate within the parameters of the overall strategic approach.\n\nRetailers must also plan for customer preferred payment modes – e.g. cash, credit, lay-by, Electronic Funds Transfer at Point-of-Sale (EFTPOS). All payment options require some type of handling and attract costs. If credit is to be offered, then credit terms will need to be determined. If lay-by is offered, then the retailer will need to take into account the storage and handling requirements. If cash is the dominant mode of payment, the retailer will need to consider small change requirements, the number of cash floats required, wages costs associated with handling large volumes of cash and the provision of secure storage for change floats. Large retailers, handling significant volumes of cash, may need to hire security service firms to carry the day's takings and deliver supplies of small change. A small, but increasing number of retailers are beginning to accept newer modes of payment including PayPal and Bitcoin. For example, Subway (US) recently announced that it would accept Bitcoin payments.\nPricing tactics that are commonly used in retail include:\n\nDiscount pricing is where the marketer or retailer offers a reduced price. Discounts in a variety of forms – e.g. quantity discounts, loyalty rebates, seasonal discounts, periodic or random discounts etc.\nEveryday low prices refers to the practice of maintaining a regular low price-low price – in which consumers are not forced to wait for discounting or specials. This method is extensively used by supermarkets.\n\nHigh-low pricing refers to the practice of offering goods at a high price for a period of time, followed by offering the same goods at a low price for a predetermined time. This practice is widely used by chain stores selling homewares. The main disadvantage of the high-low tactic is that consumers tend to become aware of the price cycles and time their purchases to coincide with a low-price cycle.\n\nA loss leader is a product that has a price set below the operating margin. Loss leadering is widely used in supermarkets and budget-priced retail outlets where it is intended to generate store traffic. The low price is widely promoted and the store is prepared to take a small loss on an individual item, with an expectation that it will recoup that loss when customers purchase other higher priced-higher margin items. In service industries, loss leadering may refer to the practice of charging a reduced price on the first order as an inducement and with anticipation of charging higher prices on subsequent orders.\n\n\nPrice bundling (also known as product bundling) occurs where two or more products or services are priced as a package with a single price. There are several types of bundles: \"pure bundles\" where the goods can only be purchased as package or \"mixed bundles\" where the goods can be purchased individually or as a package. The prices of the bundle is typically less than when the two items are purchased separately. Price bundling is extensively used in the personal care sector to prices cosmetics and skincare.\n\n\"Price lining\" is the use of a limited number of prices for all product offered by a business. Price lining is a tradition started in the old five and dime stores in which everything cost either 5 or 10 cents. In price lining, the price remains constant but quality or extent of product or service adjusted to reflect changes in cost. The underlying rationale of this tactic is that these amounts are seen as suitable price points for a whole range of products by prospective customers. It has the advantage of ease of administering, but the disadvantage of inflexibility, particularly in times of inflation or unstable prices. Price lining continues to be widely used in department stores where customers often note racks of garments or accessories priced at predetermined price points e.g. separate racks of men's ties, where each rack is priced at $10, $20 and $40.\n\nPromotional pricing is a temporary measure that involves setting prices at levels lower than normally charged for a good or service. Promotional pricing is sometimes a reaction to unforeseen circumstances, as when a downturn in demand leaves a company with excess stocks; or when competitive activity is making inroads into market share or profits.\n\nPsychological pricing is a range of tactics designed to have a positive psychological impact. Price tags using the terminal digit \"9\", ($9.99, $19.99 or $199.99) can be used to signal price points and bring an item in at just under the consumer's reservation price. Psychological pricing is widely used in a variety of retail settings.\n\nBecause patronage at a retail outlet varies, flexibility in scheduling is desirable. Employee scheduling software is sold, which, using known patterns of customer patronage, more or less reliably predicts the need for staffing for various functions at times of the year, day of the month or week, and time of day. Usually needs vary widely. Conforming staff utilization to staffing needs requires a flexible workforce which is available when needed but does not have to be paid when they are not, part-time workers; as of 2012 70% of retail workers in the United States were part-time. This may result in financial problems for the workers, who while they are required to be available at all times if their work hours are to be maximized, may not have sufficient income to meet their family and other obligations.\n\nAlso see Personal selling\nRetailers can employ different techniques to enhance sales volume and to improve the customer experience:\n\n\nOne of the unique aspects of retail promotions is that two brands are often involved; the store brand and the brands that make up the retailer's product range. Retail promotions that focus on the store tend to be ‘image’ oriented, raising awareness of the store and creating a positive attitude towards the store and its services. Retail promotions that focus on the product range, are designed to cultivate a positive attitude to the brands stocked by the store, in order to indirectly encourage favourable attitudes towards the store itself. Some retail advertising and promotion is partially or wholly funded by brands and this is known as co-operative (or co-op) advertising.\n\nRetailers make extensive use of advertising via newspapers, television and radio to encourage store preference. In order to up-sell or cross-sell, retailers also use a variety of in-store sales promotional techniques such as product demonstrations, samples, point-of-purchase displays, free trial, events, promotional packaging and promotional pricing. In grocery retail, shelf wobblers, trolley advertisements, taste tests and recipe cards are also used. Many retailers also use loyalty programs to encourage repeat patronage.\n\nSee Merchandising; Servicescapes; Retail design\nPresentation refers to the physical evidence that signals the retail image. Physical evidence may include a diverse range of elements – the store itself including premises, offices, exterior facade and interior layout, websites, delivery vans, warehouses, staff uniforms.\n\nThe environment in which the retail service encounter occurs is sometimes known as the \"retail servicescape.\" The store environment consists of many elements such as smells, the physical environment (furnishings, layout and functionality), ambient conditions (lighting, temperature, noise) as well as signs, symbols and artifacts (e.g. sales promotions, shelf space, sample stations, visual communications). Collectively, these elements contribute to the \"perceived retail servicescape\" or the overall \"atmosphere\" and can influence both the customer's cognitions, emotions and their behaviour within the retail space.\n\nRetail designers pay close attention to the front of the store, which is known as the \"decompression zone\". This is usually an open space in the entrance of the store to allow customers to adjust to their new environment. An open-plan floor design is effective in retail as it allows customers to see everything. In terms of the store's exterior, the side of the road cars normally travel, determines the way stores direct customers. New Zealand retail stores, for instance, would direct customers to the left.\n\nIn order to maximise the number of selling opportunities, retailers generally want customers to spend more time in a retail store. However, this must be balanced against customer expectations surrounding convenience, access and realistic waiting times. The overall aim of designing a retail environment is to have customers enter the store, and explore the totality of the physical environment engaging in a variety of retail experiences – from browsing through to sampling and ultimately to purchasing. The retail service environment plays an important role in affecting the customer's perceptions of the retail experience.\n\nThe retail environment not only affects quality perceptions, but can also impact on the way that customers navigate their way through the retail space during the retail service encounter. Layout, directional signage, the placement of furniture, shelves and display space along with the store's ambient conditions all affect patron's passage through the retail service system. Layout refers to how equipment, shelves and other furnishings are placed and the relationship between them. In a retail setting, accessibility is an important aspect of layout. For example, the grid layout used by supermarkets with long aisles and gondolas at the end displaying premium merchandise or promotional items, minimises the time customers spend in the environment and makes productive use of available space. The gondola, so favoured by supermarkets, is an example of a retail design feature known as a \"merchandise outpost\" and which refers to special displays, typically at or near the end of an aisle, whose purpose is to stimulate impulse purchasing or to complement other products in the vicinity. For example, the meat cabinet at the supermarket might use a merchandise outpost to suggest a range of marinades or spice rubs to complement particular cuts of meat. As a generalisation, merchandise outposts are updated regularly so that they maintain a sense of novelty.\n\nAccording to Ziethaml et al., layout affects how easy or difficult it is to navigate through a system. Signs and symbols provide cues for directional navigation and also inform about appropriate behaviour within a store. Functionality refers to extent to which the equipment and layout meet the goals of the customer. For instance, in the case of supermarkets, the customer's goal may be to minimise the amount of time spent finding items and waiting at the check-out, while a customer in a retail mall may wish to spend more time exploring the range of stores and merchandise. With respect to functionality of layout, retail designers consider three key issues; circulation – design for traffic-flow and that encourages customers to traverse the entire store; coordination – design that combines goods and spaces in order to suggest customer needs and convenience – design that arranges items to create a degree of comfort and access for both customers and employees.\n\nThe way that brands are displayed is also part of the overall retail design. Where a product is placed on the shelves has implications for purchase likelihood as a result of visibility and access. Products placed too high or too low on the shelves may not turn over as quickly as those placed at eye level. With respect to access, store designers are increasingly giving consideration to access for disabled and elderly customers.\n\nThrough sensory stimulation retailers can engage maximum emotional impact between a brand and its consumers by relating to both profiles; the goal and experience. Purchasing behaviour can be influenced through the physical evidence detected by the senses of touch, smell, sight, taste and sound. Supermarkets offer taste testers to heighten the sensory experience of brands. Coffee shops allow the aroma of coffee to waft into streets so that passers-by can appreciate the smell and perhaps be lured inside. Clothing garments are placed at arms' reach, allowing customers to feel the different textures of clothing. Retailers understand that when customers interact with products or handle the merchandise, they are more likely to make a purchase.\n\nWithin the retail environment, different spaces may be designed for different purposes. Hard floors, such as wooden floors, used in public areas, contrast with carpeted fitting rooms, which are designed to create a sense of homeliness when trying on garments. Peter Alexander, retailer of sleep ware, is renowned for using scented candles in retail stores.\n\nAmbient conditions, such as lighting, temperature and music, are also part of the overall retail environment. It is common for a retail store to play music that relates to their target market. Studies have found that \"positively valenced music will stimulate more thoughts and feeling than negatively valenced music\", hence, positively valenced music will make the waiting time feel longer to the customer than negatively valenced music. In a retail store, for example, changing the background music to a quicker tempo may influence the consumer to move through the space at a quicker pace, thereby improving traffic flow. Evidence also suggests that playing music reduces the negative effects of waiting since it serves as a distraction. Jewellery stores like Michael Hill have dim lighting with a view to fostering a sense of intimacy.\n\nThe design of a retail store is critical when appealing to the intended market, as this is where first impressions are made. The overall servicescape can influence a consumer's perception of the quality of the store, communicating value in visual and symbolic ways. Certain techniques are used to create a consumer brand experience, which in the long run drives store loyalty.\n\nTwo different strands of research have investigated shopper behaviour. One strand is primarily concerned with shopper motivations. Another stream of research seeks to segment shoppers according to common, shared characteristics. To some extent, these streams of research are inter-related, but each stream offers different types of insights into shopper behaviour.\n\nBabin et al. carried out some of the earliest investigations into shopper motivations and identified two broad motives: \"utilitarian\" and \"hedonic.\" Utilitarian motivations are task-related and rational. For the shopper with utilitarian motives, purchasing is a work-related task that is to be accomplished in the most efficient and expedient manner. On the other hand, hedonic motives refer to pleasure. The shopper with hedonic motivations views shopping as a form of escapism where they are free to indulge fantasy and freedom. Hedonic shoppers are more involved in the shopping experience.\n\nMany different shopper profiles can be identified. Retailers develop customised segmentation analyses for each unique outlet. However, it is possible to identify a number of broad shopper profiles. One of the most well-known and widely cited shopper typologies is that developed by Sproles and Kendal in the mid-1980s. Sproles and Kendall's consumer typology has been shown to be relatively consistent across time and across cultures. Their typology is based on the consumer's approach to making purchase decisions.\n\n\nSome researchers have adapted Sproles and Kendall's methodology for use in specific countries or cultural groups. Consumer decision styles are important for retailers and marketers because they describe behaviours that are relatively stable over time and for this reason, they are useful for market segmentation.\n\nThe \"retail format\" (also known as the \"retail formula\") influences the consumer's store choice and addresses the consumer's expectations. At its most basic level, a retail format is a simple marketplace, that is; a location where goods and services are exchanged. In some parts of the world, the retail sector is still dominated by small family-run stores, but large retail chains are increasingly dominating the sector, because they can exert considerable buying power and pass on the savings in the form of lower prices. Many of these large retail chains also produce their own private labels which compete alongside manufacturer brands. Considerable consolidation of retail stores has changed the retail landscape, transferring power away from wholesalers and into the hands of the large retail chains.\n\nIn Britain and Europe, the retail sale of goods is designated as a \"service activity.\" The European Service Directive applies to all retail trade including periodic markets, street traders and peddlers.\n\nRetail stores may be classified by the type of product carried:\n\nRetailers carrying highly perishable foodstuffs such as meat, dairy and fresh produce typically require cold storage facilities. Consumers purchase food products on a very regular purchase cycle – e.g. daily, weekly or monthly.\nSoftline retailers sell goods that are consumed after a single use, or have a limited life (typically under three years) in they are normally consumed. Soft goods include clothing, other fabrics, footwear, toiletries, cosmetics, medicines and stationery.\nGrocery stores, including supermarkets and hypermarkets, along with convenience stores carry a mix of food products and consumable household items such as detergents, cleansers, personal hygiene products. Consumer consumables are collectively known as fast-moving-consumer goods (FMCG) and represent the lines most often carried by supermarkets, grocers and convenience stores. For consumers, these are regular purchases and for the retailer, these products represent high turnover product lines. Grocery stores and convenience stores carry similar lines, but a convenience store is often open at times that suit its clientele and may be located for ease of access.\nRetailers selling consumer durables are sometimes known as \"hardline retailers\" – automobiles, appliances, electronics, furniture, sporting goods, lumber, etc., and parts for them. Goods that do not quickly wear out and provide utility over time. For the consumer, these items often represent major purchase decisions. Consumers purchase durables over longer purchase decision cycles. For instance, the typical consumer might replace their family car every 5 years, and their home computer every 4 years.\nSpecialist retailers operate in many industries such as the arts e.g. green grocers, contemporary art galleries, bookstores, handicrafts, musical instruments, gift shops.\n\nTypes of retail outlet by product type\nTypes of retail outlet by marketing strategy include:\nA shopping arcade refers to a group of retail outlets operating under a covered walkway. Arcades are similar to shopping malls, although they typically comprise a smaller number of outlets. Shopping arcades were the evolutionary precursor to the shopping mall, and were very fashionable in the late 19th-century. Stylish men and women would promenade around the arcade, stopping to window shop, making purchases and also taking light refreshments in one of the arcade's tea-rooms. Arcades offered fashionable men and women opportunities to 'be seen' and to socialise in a relatively safe environment. Arcades continue to exist as a distinct type of retail outlet. Historic 19th-century arcades have become popular tourist attractions in cities around the world. Amusement arcades, also known as penny arcades in the US, are more modern incarnation of the eighteenth and nineteenth century shopping arcade.\nAn anchor store (also known as draw tenant or anchor tenant) is a larger store with a good reputation used by shopping mall management to attract a certain volume of shoppers to a precinct.\nThe term, 'bazaar' can have multiple meanings. It may refer to a Middle-Eastern market place while a 'penny bazaar' refers to a retail outlet that specialises in inexpensive or discounted merchandise. In the United States a bazaar can mean a \"rummage sale\" which describes a charity fundraising event held by a church or other community organization and in which either donated used goods are made available for sale. \nA Boutique is a small store offering a select range of fashionable goods or accessories. The term, 'boutique', in retail and services, appears to be taking on a broader meaning with popular references to retail goods and retail services such as boutique hotels, boutique beers (i.e. craft beers), boutique investments etc.\n\nBy supplying a wide assortment in a single category for lower prices a category killer retailer can \"kill\" that category for other retailers. A category killer is a specialist store that dominates a given category. Toys \"R\" Us, established in 1957, is thought to be the first category killer, dominating the children's toys and games market. For a few categories, such as electronics, home hardware, office supplies and children's toys, the products are displayed at the centre of the store and a sales person will be available to address customer queries and give suggestions when required. Rival retail stores are forced to reduce their prices if a category killer enters the market in a given geographic area. Examples of category killers include Toys \"R\" Us and Australia's Bunnings (hardware, DIY and outdoor supplies) and Officeworks (stationery and supplies for the home office and small office). Some category killers redefine the category. For example, Australia's Bunnings began as a hardware outlet, but now supplies a broad range of goods for the home handyman or small tradesman, including kitchen cabinetry, craft supplies, gardening needs and outdoor furniture. Similarly Officeworks straddles the boundary between stationery supplies, office furniture and digital communications devices in its quest to provide for all the needs of the retail consumer and the small, home office.\nChain store is one of a series of stores owned by the same company and selling the same or similar merchandise. Chain stores aim to benefit from volume buying discounts (economies of scale) and achieve cost savings through economies of scope (e.g. centralised warehousing, marketing, promotion and administration) and pass on the cost savings in the form of lower prices.\n\nConcept stores are similar to speciality stores in that they are very small in size, and only stock a limited range of brands or a single brand. They are typically operated by the brand that controls them. Example: L'OCCITANE en Provence. The limited size and offering of L'OCCITANE's stores is too small to be considered a speciality store. However, a concept store goes beyond merely selling products, and instead offers an immersive customer experience built around the way that a brand fits with the customer's lifestyle. Examples include Apple's concept stores, Kit Kat's concept store in Japan.\nA co-operative store; also known as a co-op or coop, is a venture owned and operated by consumers to meet their social, economic and cultural needs.\nA convenience store provides limited amount of merchandise at above average prices with a speedy checkout. This store is ideal for emergency and immediate purchase consumables as it often operates with extended hours, stocking every day.\nDepartment stores are very large stores offering an extensive assortment of both \"soft\" and \"hard\" goods which often bear a resemblance to a collection of specialty stores. A retailer of such store carries a variety of categories and has a broad assortment of goods at moderate prices. They offer considerable customer service.\nA destination store is one that customers will initiate a trip specifically to visit, sometimes over a large area. These stores are often used to \"anchor\" a shopping mall or plaza, generating foot traffic, which is capitalized upon by smaller retailers.\nRetailers that aim at one particular segment (e.g. high-end/ luxury retailers focusing on wealthy individuals or niche market).\nDiscount stores tend to offer a wide array of products and services, but they compete mainly on price. They offer extensive assortments of merchandise at prices lower than other retailers and are designed to be affordable for the market served. In the past, retailers sold less fashion-oriented brands. However, in more recent years companies such as TJX Companies (Own T.J. Maxx and Marshalls) and Ross Stores are discount store operations increasingly offering fashion-oriented brands on a larger scale.\nThe customer can shop and order through the internet and the merchandise is dropped at the customer's doorstep or an e-tailer. In some cases, e-retailers use drop shipping technique. They accept the payment for the product but the customer receives the product directly from the manufacturer or a wholesaler. This format is ideal for customers who do not want to travel to retail stores and are interested in home shopping.\n\nA general merchandise retailer stocks a variety of products in considerable depth. The types of product offerings vary across this category. Department stores, convenience stores, hypermarkets and warehouse clubs are all examples of general merchandise retailers.\nA general store is a store that supplies the main needs of the local community and is often located in outback or rural areas with low population densities. In areas of very low population density, a general store may be the only retail outlet within hundreds of miles. The general store carries a very broad product assortment; from foodstuffs and pharmaceuticals through to hardware and fuel. In addition, a general store may provide essential services such as postal services, banking services, news agency services and may also act as an agent for farm equipment and stock-food suppliers.\nAs the name implies, a give-away shop provides goods for free. There are several different models of give-away shop in popular use. One is where goods are free to any shopper; an alternative is that shoppers must provide a product before they can take a product and a third variation is where consumers have the option of taking goods for free or paying any amount that they can afford. For example, Australia's restaurant group Lentil as Anything operates on a pay whatever you feel is right model.\nHawkers also known as a peddlers, costermongers or street vendors; refer to a vendor of merchandise that is readily portable. Hawkers typically operate in public places such as streets, squares, public parks or gardens or near the entrances of high traffic venues such as zoos, music and entertainment venues, but may also call on homes for door-to-door seling. Hawkers are a relatively common sight across Asia.\nA high street store is a term used widely in the United Kingdom where more than 5,000 High Streets where a variety of stores congregate along a main road. Stores situated in the High Street provide for the needs of a local community, and often give a locality a unique identity.\nA hypermarket (also known as hypermart) provides variety and huge volumes of exclusive merchandise at low margins. The operating cost is comparatively less than other retail formats; may be defined as \"a combined supermarket and discount store, at least or larger, that sells a wide variety of food and general merchandise at a low price.\"\nA mall has a range of retail shops at a single building or outlet, arranged on a single level or multiple levels. A shopping mall typically includes one or more \"anchor\" stores. The retail mix in a mall may include outlets such as food and entertainment, grocery, electronics, furniture, gifts and fashion. Malls provide 7% of retail revenue in India, 10% in Vietnam, 25% in China, 28% in Indonesia, 39% in the Philippines, and 45% in Thailand. Malls are typically managed by a central management/ marketing authority which ensures that the mall attracts the right type of retailer and an appropriate retail mix.\nA small retail outlet owned and operated by an individual or family. Focuses on a relatively limited and selective set of products.\n\nA Pop-up retail store is a temporary retail space that opens for a short period of time, possibly opening to sell a specific run of merchandise or for a special occasion or holiday period. The key to the success of a pop-up is novelty in the merchandise.\nA Marketplace is defined as venue for the retail sales of all products, packed and unpacked where the sale is to end users. In practice, retail markets are most often associated with the sale of fresh produce, including fruit, vegetables, meat, fish and poultry, but may also sell small consumable household goods such as cleaning agents. Globally, different terms may be used to refer to a retail market. For instance, in the Middle East, a market place may be known as a bazaar or souq/souk\nA market square is a city square where traders set up temporary stalls and buyers browse for purchases. In England, such markets operate on specific days of the week. This kind of market is very ancient, and countless such markets are still in operation around the world.\nA speciality (AE: specialty) store has a narrow marketing focus  – either specializing on specific merchandise, such as toys, footwear, or clothing, or on a target audience, such as children, tourists, or plus-size women. Size of store varies  – some speciality stores might be retail giants such as Toys \"R\" Us, Foot Locker, and The Body Shop, while others might be small, individual shops such as Nutters of Savile Row. Such stores, regardless of size, tend to have a greater depth of the specialist stock than general stores, and generally offer specialist product knowledge valued by the consumer. Pricing is usually not the priority when consumers are deciding upon a speciality store; factors such as branding image, selection choice, and purchasing assistance are seen as important. They differ from department stores and supermarkets which carry a wide range of merchandise.\nA supermarket is a self-service store consisting mainly of grocery and limited products on non-food items. They may adopt a Hi-Lo or an EDLP strategy for pricing. The supermarkets can be anywhere between and . Example: SPAR supermarket.\nVariety stores offer extremely low-cost goods, with a vast array of selection. The downfall to this is that the items are not very high quality.\n\nA vending machine is an automated piece of equipment wherein customers can drop the money in the machine which dispenses the customer's selection. The vending machine is a pure self-service option. Machines may carry a phone number which customers can call in the event of a fault.\n\nSome stores take a no frills approach, while others are \"mid-range\" or \"high end\", depending on what income level they target.\nWarehouse clubs are membership-based retailers that usually sell a wide variety of merchandise, in which customers may buy large, wholesale quantities of the store's products, which makes these clubs attractive to both bargain hunters and small business owners. The clubs are able to keep prices low due to the no-frills format of the stores. In addition, customers may be required to pay annual membership fees in order to shop.\nWarehouse stores are retailers housed in warehouses, and offer low-cost, often high-quantity goods with minimal services, e.g. goods are piled on pallets or steel shelves. shopping aisles are narrow and cramped, added-value services such as home delivery are non-existent.\n\nOther types of retail store include:\n\nRetailers can opt for a format as each provides different retail mix to its customers based on their customer demographics, lifestyle and purchase behaviour. An effective format will dtermine how products are display products, as well as how target customers are attracted.\n\nTo achieve and maintain a foothold in an existing market, a prospective retail establishment must overcome the following hurdles:\n\nChina is currently the largest retail market in the world.\n\nRetail stores may or may not have competitors close enough to affect their pricing, product availability, and other operations. A 2006 survey found that only 38% of retail stores in India believed they faced more than slight competition. Competition also affected less than half of retail stores in Kazakhstan, Bulgaria, and Azerbaijan. In all countries the main competition was domestic, not foreign.\nRetail trade provides 9% of all jobs in India and 14% of GDP.\n\nBetween 1985 and 2018 there have been 46,755 mergers or acquisitions conducted globally in the retail sector (either acquirer or target from the retail industry). These deals cumulate to an overall known value of around 2.561 bil. USD. The three major Retail M&A waves took place in 2000, 2007 and lately in 2017. However the all-time high in terms of number of deals was in 2016 with more than 2,700 deals. In terms of added value 2007 set the record with 225 bil. USD.\n\nHere is a list of the top ten largest deals (ranked by volume) in the Retail Industry: \n\nSTORES Magazine annually ranks the nation’s top retailers according to sales.\n\nTop 100 Chart\nSince 1951, the U.S. Census Bureau has published the Retail Sales report every month. It is a measure of consumer spending, an important indicator of the US GDP. Retail firms provide data on the dollar value of their retail sales and inventories. A sample of 12,000 firms is included in the final survey and 5,000 in the advanced one. The advanced estimated data is based on a subsample from the US CB complete retail & food services sample.\n\nIn 2011, the grocery market in six countries of Central Europe was worth nearly €107bn, 2.8% more than the previous year when expressed in local currencies. The increase was generated foremost by the discount stores and supermarket segments, and was driven by the skyrocketing prices of foodstuffs. This information is based on the latest PMR report entitled Grocery retail in Central Europe 2012<ref name=\"http://www.pmrpublications.com/product/Grocery-retail-Central-Europe-2012\"> Grocery retail in Central Europe 2012 Retail in Central Europe</ref>\n\nNational accounts show a combined total of retail and wholesale trade, with hotels and restaurants. in 2012 the sector provides over a fifth of GDP in tourist-oriented island economies, as well as in other major countries such as Brazil, Pakistan, Russia, and Spain. In all four of the latter countries, this fraction is an increase over 1970, but there are other countries where the sector has declined since 1970, sometimes in absolute terms, where other sectors have replaced its role in the economy. In the United States the sector has declined from 19% of GDP to 14%, though it has risen in absolute terms from $4,500 to $7,400 per capita per year. In China the sector has grown from 7.3% to 11.5%, and in India even more, from 8.4% to 18.7%. Emarketer predicts China will have the largest retail market in the world in 2016.\n\nIn 2016, China became the largest retail market in the world.\n\nAmong retailers and retails chains a lot of consolidation has appeared over the last couple of decades. Between 1988 and 2010, worldwide 40,788 mergers & acquisitions with a total known value of 2.255 trillion USD have been announced. The largest transactions with involvement of retailers in/from the United States have been: the acquisition of Albertson's Inc. for 17 bil. USD in 2006, the merger between Federated Department Stores Inc with May Department Stores valued at 16.5 bil. USD in 2005 – now Macy's, and the merger between Kmart Holding Corp and Sears Roebuck & Co with a value of 10.9 bil. USD in 2004.\n\nTypes of sales person:\nTypes of store or shop:\nInfluential thinkers in sales and retail:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "57210764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57210764", "title": "Reward Work Act", "text": "Reward Work Act\n\nThe Reward Work Act of 2018 (S.2605 and HR 6096) is a proposed United States Act of Congress to ban unjustified stock buy-backs, and to require every listed company enable employees to elect one-third of the board of directors. The Bill was sponsored initially by Senators Tammy Baldwin, Elizabeth Warren and Brian Schatz in March 2018, and joined in April 2018 by Kirsten Gillibrand. It was sponsored in the House of Representatives in June 2018 by Keith Ellison and Ro Khanna.\n\nSection 2 prohibits stock buybacks on the open market.\n\nSection 3 requires one-third board representation for employees of listed companies. Specifically, this amends §12b of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 USC 78l(b)(1)) to add \"No issuer may register securities on a national exchange unless at least 1⁄3 of the issuer’s directors are chosen by the issuing company’s employees in a one-employee-one-vote election process.\" It then requires the Securities and Exchange Commission, consulting with the National Labor Relations Board to make regulations ensuring democratic election processes, and 1/3 of an issuer's board to \"be composed of employee representatives within 2 years of the date of enactment of this Act.\"\n\nThe problem of stock buybacks as a source of US income inequality had become highly visible as a result of the award-winning 2014 publication of the \"Harvard Business Review\" article, \"Profits Without Prosperity: Stock Buybacks Manipulate the Market and Leave Most Americans Worse Off,\" by William Lazonick. The Act was welcomed by the Roosevelt Institute, and media outlets. The Act also gathered endorsements from the following groups:\n\n\nA Civis poll found people in \"the “lean Democrat” category voted 75% in favor of the question, and just 9% opposed. Around 43% of the “lean Republican” category supported the concept, while 31% opposed, and the pure Republican category saw 4% more opposed than in favor. But overall, a clear majority of people favor the concept.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Small companies generally are not able to secure the best (prime) borrowing rates and wield reduced power, including a smaller market share. Being small, they are also less financially stable than larger companies, and are more likely to become bankrupt. However, they do generally have more growth potential and over time have greater but more volatile expected returns.\n\n"}
{"id": "46422056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46422056", "title": "Stu Strumwasser", "text": "Stu Strumwasser\n\nStu Strumwasser (born March 25, 1966) is an American novelist, entrepreneur and investment banker. He is a graduate of Cornell University where he studied Marketing/Advertising and Creative Writing. His novel, THE ORGAN BROKER, is a depiction of the global black market for organs—a consequence of the organ shortage crisis in American and around the world—and establishes Strumwasser as a thought leader on the bioethical issues that he has written about for publications like Salon.com.\n\nStrumwasser writes thrillers with underlying socio-political themes. His first novel, A METAL SKY, was a coming of age story combined with an exposé of fundraisers for police unions. THE ORGAN BROKER, a novel about a black market organ broker, will be released by the Arcade Imprint of Skyhorse Publishing in May 2015. While the book is a novel, the author has developed a secondary agenda of advocating for those in need of organ donations. In the Salon.com article, published in march of 2013, he said, “The tragic aspect of this particular shortage is that there are plenty of organs and there are things we can do.\" Strumwasser calls on Congress to enact more modern legislation related to the issue of organ transplantation. In his next book, THE AMERICAN PARTY, Strumwasser takes on broken government and the unfolding oligarchy being created by the two major political parties.\n\nStrumwasser worked on Wall St. from 1990 until 2005 in the area of wealth management, serving as a VP and Director at major firms including Paine Webber (now UBS) and Oppenheimer & Co.\n\nFor most of the time that Strumwasser worked on Wall Street he concurrently pursued a career as an aspiring novelist and also as the primary songwriter and drummer in the indie rock band Channeling Owen. In a feature article in Forbes ASAP (a 90s technology supplement to Forbes) freelance journalist David Freedman noted that, \"Stu Strumwasser, Channeling Owen's drummer, principal songwriter, and administrator...\" was, \"obsessed with making it in rock and roll since he was 6.\" Freedman's article contrasted the release of a new record by Strumwasser's indie rock band and MCA recording artist Blink-182 in a changing landscape for the music business. \nIn 1999 the band was referred to by Electronic Sonic Press as, \"… next in the great lineage of soul-searching groups such as Live, Collective Soul, and Creed, not to mention Jars of Clay.\" Heard magazine called the band's first full-length release, Small-minded Voodoo Theories, \"well executed, displaying both great production techniques and a flair for solid songwriting,\" and Modernrock.com referenced Strumwasser's songwriting as, \"full of historical references, poetic metaphors, and literary allusions.\" On 1/12/00, the band's song,\"Scared Of me,\" was featured in the Dawson's Creek episode \"Barefoot at Capefest\" on the WB network. Yet, the band did not succeed in becoming a profitable venture and eventually broke up in 2003.\n\nIn late 2005 Struumwasser left Wall Street to found Snow Beverages, makers of natural soda. \"To get Snow Beverages in gear, Stu Strumwasser tapped his savings...\" Strumwasser has been a vegetarian since the age of 14 (in 1980) and was determined to manufacture and distribute a natural alternative to commercial and unhealthy soda. In December 2005, with the brand merely a few months old, the Wall Street Journal referenced it as one of the new natural sodas with \"catchy names such as Fizzy Lizzy, GUS, Steaze, IZZE, or Snow...\" Launched initially as a single-flavor natural mint soda, Snow evolved in 2007 to add a, \"few new additions to the fizzy family\" and in 2010 Snow, \"dropped mint and launched three familiar flavors.\" However, despite meaningful distribution, the product line struggled to find an audience with consumers. In 2011 Strumwasser left the company which soon after ceased operations.\n\nIn 2011 Strumwasser founded a new company, Tengrade, the social rating tool, designed to enable users to get, or give, Real Opinions, on anything, from friends and people like them, directly on Facebook or Twitter. Fox Business Channel called Tengrade, \"A new, one-stop rating tool for everything from cars and restaurants to hotels and pizza.\"\nGreen Circle Capital:\nConcurrent to creating Tengrade Strumwasser also returned to Wall Street, but in a different capacity. Armed with the experience of having been an entrepreneur he aimed to assist other early-stage companies with raising capital, which he now does as Senior Managing Director of Green Circle.\n"}
{"id": "22786270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22786270", "title": "Søren Kristian Toubro", "text": "Søren Kristian Toubro\n\nSøren Kristian Toubro (27 February 1906 – 4 March 1982) was a Danish engineer who co-founded Larsen & Toubro, an India-based conglomerate.\n\nToubro began his career as a Civil Engineer. As an employee of F. L. Smidth & Co. of Copenhagen, he came to India in 1934 to erect and commission the equipment supplied to the Madukkarai Cement Works (near Coimbatore) and the Rohri Cement Factory (near the Sukkur Barrage in Sindh). Sometime after landing in India, he read a report in the Bombay Chronicle that quoted Mohandas K. Gandhi as saying: \"(I am) not leading a movement to rid India of its white colonial masters in order to substitute them with brown ones.\" Toubro felt that such an India would \"offer great opportunities to anyone with modern technological and management skills\".\n\nIn 1938, Toubro partnered with his former schoolmate Henning Holck-Larsen, a chemical engineer and a fellow Smidth's employee, to establish Larsen & Toubro. The idea of L&T was conceived during a holiday in Matheran, a hill station near Bombay (now Mumbai). Holck-Larsen was a risk-taker while Toubro was more conservative. Larsen & Toubro saw opportunities in India at a time, when few Europeans had realised the country's potential for industrial growth.\n\nThe first office of L&T, located in Bombay, was so small that only one of them could use it a time. Initially, L&T represented Danish dairy equipment manufacturers. However, the Danish imports were restricted during the World War II, forcing L&T to start a small workshop that provided servicing and undertook small jobs. The imports stopped after the German invasion of Denmark, forcing L&T to start manufacturing dairy equipment indigenously, a move that was successful.\n\nSeeing opportunity in ship repair during wartime, Larsen and Toubro formed a new company called Hilda Ltd. Around this time, L&T also started two repair and fabrication shops. The internment of German engineers who were supposed to build a soda ash plant for the Tatas provided L&T another new opportunity.\n\nIn 1944, Larsen and Toubro established Engineering Construction & Contracts (ECC). L&T started collaborating with international companies around this time. In 1945, L&T signed an agreement with the Caterpillar Tractor Company of USA for marketing earthmoving equipment. L&T also started representing British manufacturers of equipment used to manufacture a variety of products including biscuits, glass, hydrogenated oils and soaps.\n\nAt the end of World War II, the war-surplus Caterpillar equipment were available in bulk at low prices. However, L&T lacked the money to purchase them. Therefore, Larsen and Toubro decided to raise additional equity capital, and as a result, Larsen & Toubro Private Limited was established on 7 February 1946. After India gained independence in 1947, L&T set up offices in Calcutta, Madras and New Delhi. In 1948, L&T acquired of undeveloped land in the Powai suburb of Mumbai.\nLarsen and Toubro gradually transformed L&T into a large business house with diverse interests. A 2006 article in The Hindu described Toubro as follows:\nSoren K Toubro served as the director of L&T from 1946 to 1981, and retired from active management in 1962–63. He continued to serve on the L&T and ECC board of directors till 1981.\n\nAfter spending nearly five decades in India, Toubro retired to Denmark in 1981, and died there next year.

Schwager published on January 26, 1992 by HarperCollins. The format is very similar to his 1988 \"Market Wizards\", with a new selection of interviews with super-traders.\n\nAs in the previous volume, Schwager starts with a frank discussion of his own trading experience, followed by a surprising diversion comparing Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait with a trade that went wrong.\n\nThe rest of the book is broken into five parts including interviews with different types of traders and brief discussions of the lessons to be learnt from them, plus a part on trading psychology and a final part summarising the wisdom gained from all of the interviewees in 42 golden rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
