In 2006, the \"New Zealand Listener\" described Hubbard as the most powerful businessman in the South Island.\n\nHubbard was listed on the New Zealand Listener Power List from 2005 through to 2007 and he was listed on the Primary Sector Power list at number four in 2009.\n\nHubbard had significant interests in dairy farming, irrigation systems, finance and helicopters. He was one of three directors of Dairy Holdings Limited, which in 2007 owned 57 dairy units, and 10 grazing blocks in the South Island. In the 2006-07 season Dairy Holdings Limited milked 44,000 cows on 16,120 hectares and produced 14.3 million kg of milksolids.\n\nHubbard died as the result of an Oamaru car crash. After being stabilised at Oamaru Hospital, he died in a short helicopter ride while being transferred from the hospital to Dunedin Hospital on 2 September 2011. In February 2012, the Oamaru police charged a 40-year-old man with careless driving causing death and injury.\nThe Mosgiel man was found guilty in August 2013.\n\nAllan Hubbard was born in 1928 in Dunedin. His parents lived with five children in a three-bedroom Dunedin North cottage with no electric lighting. In the Depression, his father was unemployed plumber who had to plant pine seedlings on a work scheme. Hubbard's first job was on a Taieri Plains dairy farm. He then worked as a clerk for Trustees Executors while studying part-time for his School Certificate, University Entrance and an accountancy degree from the universities of Otago and Canterbury. In 1953, he and Jean Hubbard, who had been a fellow student at Otago, moved to Timaru where he did bookkeeping for the Craighead school while establishing the accounting firm Hubbard Churcher. In the mid-1950s he provided the backing for Doug Shears and Helicopters New Zealand Ltd. Also in the 1950s, Hubbard gained control of South Canterbury Finance, a small-time lender to local businesses and households. In 1962 Hubbard bought a dairy farm.\n\nIn 1926, South Canterbury Finance Ltd started as a small-time lender to local businesses and households in Timaru. Allan Hubbard bought South Canterbury Finance in either the 1950s or in 1960. Hubbard was considered the driving force behind the company's growth as it ultimately became the largest financial institution in the South Island of New Zealand. By the late 2000s, South Canterbury Finance had 35,000 investors and its assets were considered to be worth almost $NZ2 billion. South Canterbury Finance owned 13 companies including fruit packaging and warehousing company Scales Corporation, helicopter and tourism business Helicopters NZ, and a third shareholding in Dairy Holdings Limited, New Zealand's largest dairy farming group.\n\nDespite its reputation as a South Island rural lender, South Canterbury Finance made loans to property development throughout New Zealand, Australia and Fiji. At 30 June 2009, property loans were $414.2 million. Real estate lending represented 207 loans with an average net loan value of $1.15 million. Further, 37 per cent of lending was secured by a second or lower ranking mortgages. There were ten property loans greater than $10 million. For some lending, the interest was capitalised into the loan debt, so borrowers did not have to immediately fund interest payments.\n\nIn June 2010, Allan Hubbard stood down as Chairman of South Canterbury Finance and was replaced by Bill Baylis.\n\nOn 31 August 2010, South Canterbury Finance asked its trustee to place it in receivership after negotiations over a recapitalisation deal failed. The Government immediately paid out investors $NZ1.6 billion under the Government's Retail Deposit Guarantee Scheme. Alan Hubbard was reported blaming the Government and the other South Canterbury Finance directors for the receivership: as the directors had sidelined him and the Government had placed him in statutory management.\n\nOn 7 December 2011, the Serious Fraud Office laid 21 charges against five individuals in respect of South Canterbury Finance. The charges related to a variety of allegedly fraudulent transactions which had a total estimated value of approximately $1.7 billion. This included an estimated $1.58 billion from the Crown Retail Deposits Guarantee Scheme. The charges included entering the Crown Guarantee Scheme by deception, omitting to disclose a related party loan of $64.185m from SCF to Southbury Group and Woolpak Holdings, failing to disclose related party loans of $19.1m from SCF to Shark Wholesalers, and breaching the crown guarantee scheme by lending $39m to Quadrant Holding Limited. The five accused were; former South Canterbury Finance chief executive Lachie McLeod, former South Canterbury Finance directors Edward Oral Sullivan and Robert Alexander White (a lawyer with Raymond Sullivan McGlashan), former chief financial officer of South Canterbury Finance, Graeme Brown, and Timaru chartered accountant Terry Hutton, formerly of Hubbard and Churcher.\nThe alleged offences included theft by a person in a special relationship, obtaining by deception, false statements by a promoter of a company and false accounting. All five defendants denied the charges. A date of Monday May 28, 2012 was set for a post committal conference.\nIn 2013 charges against Brown and Hutton were dropped, leaving the former chief executive (McLeod) and two former directors (Sullivan and White) to stand trial. \nOn 20 June 2010, the New Zealand Government placed Allan Hubbard, his wife Jean Hubbard and his business Aorangi Securities and seven charitable trusts into statutory management, with Trevor Thornton and Richard Simpson of Grant Thornton New Zealand Limited appointed as statutory managers. This decision was based on recommendations from the Securities Commission of New Zealand after a complaint from an investor. Allan Hubbard established Aorangi Securities Limited in 1974. The directors were Allan and Margaret Hubbard and the share capital was owned by another Hubbard-owned company, Forresters Nominee Company Limited. Aorangi had operated as a finance company, having raised $98 million from 407 investors living in Otago and Canterbury and making loans of approximately $134 million to borrowers. The review of the Securities Commission concluded that many of the loans were inadequately documented, appeared to be unsecured and contrary to instructions from investors. The Serious Fraud Office initiated an investigation for fraud.\n\nThe news was met with disbelief in his home town of Timaru and elsewhere in the South Island, where Hubbard was seen as a pillar of the community. There was widespread support for Allan Hubbard and a rally was held for him on 26 June 2010 in Timaru attended by thousands of people who protested against the investigation. In June 2010, supporters of Allan Hubbard started a campaign to clear his name.\n\nIn July 2010, the Statutory Managers reported that Allan Hubbard also controlled an additional business that they had not been aware of when appointed. This was Hubbard Funds Management, an investment management business estimated to be worth $70 million. It had inadequate accounting records consisting of a hand written cashbook and journals maintained by Mr Hubbard.\n\nIn September 2010, two further companies related to Hubbard Funds Management, Hubbard Churcher Trust Management Ltd and Forresters Nominee Company Ltd, were also placed under statutory management. On 11 May 2011, Allan and Jean Hubbard filed judicial review proceedings in the Timaru High Court to challenge the decision to place them into statutory management.\n\nTwo other assessments of the statutory management were also released in September 2011. On 6 September 2011, Kerry Grass released a report to the Government. Businessman Tur Borren also provided a report on the statutory management.\n\nAfter an independent review of the statutory management organised by the Registrar of Companies, Jean Hubbard was released from statutory management on 11 November 2011.\n\nIn May 2012, Statutory Managers Grant Thornton New Zealand Limited reported that investors in Hubbard Management Funds were owed $82 million, and the fund was valued at $44.8m. Grant Thornton asked the High Court to decide how to distribute the fund given the lack of a prospectus and given that the 'largely fictional' investor statements had not been reconciled to investment assets for three years.\n\nIn October 2015, Statutory Managers Grant Thornton reported paying out 99% of the money investors put into Aorangi Securities Limited, and all of the money originally put in by investors to Hubbard Management Funds. This led critics to question whether statutory management had been necessary or if the right approach had been taken by the statutory managers during their period of administration.\n\nOn 20 June 2011, the Serious Fraud Office announced that it had laid fifty charges of alleged fraud under sections 220, 242 and 260 of the Crimes Act against Alan Hubbard in the Timaru District Court.\n\nOn 9 September 2011, the Timaru District Court made an order permanently staying the prosecution of Allan James Hubbard in light of Mr Hubbard's death.\n\n"}

She collaborates with both small and large firms and integrates field experiments in order to answer this questions.\n\nIn a 2010 study, Gneezy and coauthors worked with Disney Research to study a behavioral pricing approach called pay-what-you-want at an amusement park. In a large-scale field experiment, they sold people souvenir photos from a ride at the park under four conditions. In the first of these, the photos were priced at the regular $12.95; about 0.5% (1 in 200) of people bought a photo in this condition. In the second condition, the price stayed the same but consumers were told that half of the proceeds would go to charity, which resulted in about 0.57% of people buying the photos. The third condition allowed people to pay what they want for the photos, which resulted in 16 times more sales, but at prices so low that they were unsustainable. In the final condition, Gneezy and her coauthors offered the consumers the option to pay what they want and told them half of the proceeds would go to charity. The results of the final condition were astonishing; the amusement park profited significantly from this condition, along with a considerable amount of money being raised for the charity. This demonstrated what Gneezy and her colleagues refer to as \"shared social responsibility\" – the idea that involving the consumer in the pricing of goods and the choice of contributions increases the benefit to both the consumers and the company.\n\nThe results of this study received widespread media attention and have inspired many more studies and experiments.

{"id": "4662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4662", "title": "Bookkeeping", "text": "Bookkeeping\n\nBookkeeping is the recording of financial transactions, and is part of the process of accounting in business. Transactions include purchases, sales, receipts, and payments by an individual person or an organization/corporation. There are several standard methods of bookkeeping, such as the single-entry bookkeeping system and the double-entry bookkeeping system, but, while they may be thought of as \"real\" bookkeeping, any process that involves the recording of financial transactions is a bookkeeping process.\n\nBookkeeping is usually performed by a bookkeeper. A bookkeeper (or book-keeper) is a person who records the day-to-day financial transactions of a business. They are usually responsible for writing the \"daybooks\", which contain records of purchases, sales, receipts, and payments. The bookkeeper is responsible for ensuring that all transactions whether it is cash transaction or credit transaction are recorded in the correct daybook, supplier's ledger, customer ledger, and general ledger; an accountant can then create reports from the information concerning the financial transactions recorded by the bookkeeper.\n\nBookkeeping refers mainly to the record-keeping aspects of accounting. Bookkeeping involves preparing source documents for all transactions, operations, and other events of the business. \n\nThe bookkeeper brings the books to the trial balance stage: an accountant may prepare the income statement and balance sheet using the trial balance and ledgers prepared by the bookkeeper.\n\nThe origin of book-keeping is lost in obscurity, but recent researches would appear to show that some method of keeping accounts has existed from the remotest times. Babylonian records have been found dating back as far as 2600 B.C., written with a stylus on small slabs of clay. \nThe term \"waste book\" was used in colonial America referring to bookkeeping. The purpose was to document daily transactions including receipts and expenditures. This was recorded in chronological order, and the purpose was for temporary use only. The daily transactions would then be recorded in a daybook or account ledger in order to balance the accounts. The name \"waste book\" comes from the fact that once the waste book's data were transferred to the actual journal, the waste book could be discarded.\n\nThe bookkeeping process primarily records the \"financial effects\" of transactions. The difference between a manual and any electronic accounting system results from the former's latency (engineering) between the recording of a financial transaction and its posting in the relevant account. This delay—absent in electronic accounting systems due to nearly instantaneous posting into relevant accounts—is a basic characteristic of manual systems, thus giving rise to primary books of accounts such as Cash Book, Bank Book, Purchase Book, and Sales Book for recording the immediate effect of a financial transaction.\n\nIn the normal course of business, a document is produced each time a transaction occurs. Sales and purchases usually have invoices or receipts. Deposit slips are produced when lodgements (deposits) are made to a bank account. Checks (spelled \"cheques\" in the UK and several other countries) are written to pay money out of the account. Bookkeeping first involves recording the details of all of these \"source documents\" into multi-column \"journals\" (also known as \"books of first entry\" or \"daybooks\"). For example, all credit sales are recorded in the sales journal; all cash payments are recorded in the cash payments journal. Each column in a journal normally corresponds to an account. In the single entry system, each transaction is recorded only once. Most individuals who balance their check-book each month are using such a system, and most personal-finance software follows this approach.\n\nAfter a certain period, typically a month, each column in each journal is totalled to give a summary for that period. Using the rules of double-entry, these journal summaries are then transferred to their respective accounts in the ledger, or \"account book\". For example, the entries in the Sales Journal are taken and a debit entry is made in each customer's account (showing that the customer now owes us money), and a credit entry might be made in the account for \"Sale of class 2 widgets\" (showing that this activity has generated revenue for us). This process of transferring summaries or individual transactions to the ledger is called \"posting\". Once the posting process is complete, accounts kept using the \"T\" format undergo \"balancing\", which is simply a process to arrive at the balance of the account.\n\nAs a partial check that the posting process was done correctly, a working document called an \"unadjusted trial balance\" is created. In its simplest form, this is a three-column list. Column One contains the names of those accounts in the ledger which have a non-zero balance. If an account has a \"debit\" balance, the balance amount is copied into Column Two (the \"debit column\"); if an account has a \"credit\" balance, the amount is copied into Column Three (the \"credit column\"). The debit column is then totalled, and then the credit column is totalled. The two totals must agree—which is not by chance—because under the double-entry rules, whenever there is a posting, the debits of the posting equal the credits of the posting. If the two totals do not agree, an error has been made, either in the journals or during the posting process. The error must be located and rectified, and the totals of the debit column and the credit column recalculated to check for agreement before any further processing can take place.\n\nOnce the accounts balance, the accountant makes a number of adjustments and changes the balance amounts of some of the accounts. These adjustments must still obey the double-entry rule: for example, the \"inventory\" account and asset account might be changed to bring them into line with the actual numbers counted during a stocktake. At the same time, the \"expense\" account associated with usage of inventory is adjusted by an equal and opposite amount. Other adjustments such as posting depreciation and prepayments are also done at this time. This results in a listing called the \"adjusted trial balance\". It is the accounts in this list, and their corresponding debit or credit balances, that are used to prepare the financial statements.\n\nFinally financial statements are drawn from the trial balance, which may include:\n\nTwo common bookkeeping systems used by businesses and other organizations are the single-entry bookkeeping system and the double-entry bookkeeping system. Single-entry bookkeeping uses only income and expense accounts, recorded primarily in a revenue and expense journal. Single-entry bookkeeping is adequate for many small businesses. In the double-entry accounting system, at least two accounting entries are required to record each financial transaction. These entries may occur in asset, liability, equity, expense, or revenue accounts.\n\nThe primary bookkeeping record in single-entry bookkeeping is the \"cash book\", which is similar to a checking account (UK: cheque account, current account) register, but allocates the income and expenses to various income and expense accounts. Separate account records are maintained for petty cash, accounts payable and receivable, and other relevant transactions such as inventory and travel expenses. These days, single-entry bookkeeping can be done with DIY bookkeeping software to speed up manual calculations.\n\nA \"double-entry bookkeeping system\" is a set of rules for recording financial information in a financial accounting system in which every transaction or event changes at least two different nominal ledger accounts.\n\nA \"daybook\" is a descriptive and chronological (diary-like) record of day-to-day financial transactions also called a \"book of original entry\". The daybook's details must be entered formally into journals to enable posting to ledgers. Daybooks include:\n\n\nA \"petty cash\" book is a record of small-value purchases before they are later transferred to the ledger and final accounts; it is maintained by a petty or junior cashier. This type of cash book usually uses the imprest system: a certain amount of money is provided to the petty cashier by the senior cashier. This money is to cater for minor expenditures (hospitality, minor stationery, casual postage, and so on) and is reimbursed periodically on satisfactory explanation of how it was spent.\n\n\"Journals\" are recorded in the general journal daybook. A journal is a formal and chronological record of financial transactions before their values are accounted for in the general ledger as debits and credits. A company can maintain one journal for all transactions, or keep several journals based on similar activity (e.g., sales, cash receipts, revenue, etc.), making transactions easier to summarize and reference later. For every debit journal entry recorded, there must be an equivalent credit journal entry to maintain a balanced accounting equation.\n\nA \"ledger\" is a record of accounts.The ledger is a permanent summary of all amounts entered in supporting Journals which list individual transactions by date. These accounts are recorded separately, showing their beginning/ending balance. A journal lists financial transactions in chronological order, without showing their balance but showing how much is going to be charged in each account. A ledger takes each financial transaction from the journal and records it into the corresponding account for every transaction listed. The ledger also sums up the total of every account, which is transferred into the balance sheet and the income statement. There are three different kinds of ledgers that deal with book-keeping:\n\n\nA chart of accounts is a list of the accounts codes that can be identified with numeric, alphabetical, or alphanumeric codes allowing the account to be located in the general ledger. The equity section of the chart of accounts is based on the fact that the legal structure of the entity is of a particular legal type. Possibilities include \"sole trader\", \"partnership\", \"trust\", and \"company\".\n\nComputerized bookkeeping removes many of the paper \"books\" that are used to record the financial transactions of an entity—instead, relational databases take their place, but they still typically enforce the double-entry bookkeeping system and methodology. CPAs design the internal controls for the computerized bookkeeping system, which serve to minimize errors in documenting the big number of activities that the entity engages in over the period.\n\n"}

An investment banker, an underwriter, or a stock promoter may, wholly or in part, perform the role of a promoter. Promoters generally owe a duty of utmost good faith, so as to not mislead any potential investors, and disclose all material facts about the company's business.\n\nGenerally, promoters are in a fiduciary relationship with the company and its investors and shareholders, and must avoid conflicts of interests and exercise reasonable care in performing their duties. They must refrain from self-dealing or other types of abuse to take advantage of their position as a promoter. Self-dealing occurs, for example, when a promoter unfairly profits from the conduct of business with the company by charging higher prices for the goods they sell to the company than it would otherwise pay.\n\nA promoter can be a shareholder in the promoted company. If the promoter is the only shareholder, the company may, in compliance with the rule of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and similar rules in other jurisdictions, need to disclose the information prior to selling shares to the public.\n\nThe fiduciary duties of promoters include:\n\n\nIf a promoter fails to disclose the profits, made by him in the course of promotion or he knowingly makes a false statement in the prospectus, whereby the person relying on that statement, makes a loss, he will be liable to make good the loss, suffered by that other person. The promoter is liable for untrue statements, made in the prospectus.\n\nA person, who subscribes for any shares or debenture in a company on the faith of the untrue statement contained in the prospectus, can sue the promoter for the loss or damages, sustained by the subscriber as the result of such untrue statement.\n\nPromoters may be classified into the following types.\n\nThere are firms which specialise in company promotion, including its incorporation and flotation, before handing it over to the shareholders or their representatives for the company.\n\nThese promoters take interest in floating some companies. They are not engaged in promotion work on a regular basis. They take up the promotion of some company and once it is over they go to their original profession.For instance, engineers, lawyers etc. may float some companies.\n\nThey are both promoters and entrepreneurs. They conceive the idea of a new business unit, do the groundwork to establish it and may subsequently become a part of the management.\n\nSome financial institutions, like investment banks or industrial banks, may take up the promotion of a company with a view to finding opportunities for investment.\n\nThe functions of a promoter may include:\n\nThe first stage in company promotion is the generation of new ideas. It is the promoter who conceives the idea of setting up a business, and makes an assessment of the viability of a particular aspects business be it technical feasibility ,financial feasibility ,economic feasibility and also incorporation of company .\n\nPromoters undertakes a detailed investigation of the viability, profitability and future prospects of the growth of the proposed activity, and may seek the help of specialists such as lawyers, accountants, cost accountants, a company secretary, and engineers. Organisations engaged in market research and other specialised agencies. Specialists are in a position to make an objective analysis of their own areas which may help the promoters. Decisions have to be taken regarding the size, location, layout, manpower etc.\n\nIf the proposed endeavour gives promise of success and the promoter is willing to undertake the risk of forming the business, step must be taken to assemble various factors of production, such as land, labour, capital and managerial personnel. Assembly of resources involves making contracts for the purchase of these resources.promoters organise the resources to convert the idea into a reality by forming a company.\n\nThe promoter may enter into contracts with third parties in anticipation of the registration of a company; but after registration, the company must approve or confirm these contracts.\n\n"}

In 1863 his family moved from Glasgow to the United States of America, sailing on the \"Cynosure\" and eventually settling in Ogden Valley located in eastern Weber County, Utah. The move was made because of their joining The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and their desire to be near the body of the church. He lived in both Eden and Liberty, Utah.\n\nAfter struggling to make a living, the family moved to Oregon City, Oregon. There they worked in a new mill. He worked for the mill for a year, then for a lumber corporation, and the Oregon and California Railroad. The family moved back to Ogden, Utah in 1869 after the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad hoping it would bring them work.\n\nIn the Ogden area, he worked cutting wood and building homes. He worked as a freighter and for the Union Pacific coal mines. He also worked at a sawmill at Monte Cristo east of Ogden.\n\nIn 1874, he attended Louis F. Moench's school in Ogden. It was there he met Bertha Marie Jensen and married her in 1875. They had 12 children from this marriage.\n\nWhile he had been working he saved up a considerable amount of money and put it to other uses. He started the Eccles Lumber Company and several other enterprises. Through supplying ties for railroads, he knew the local circumstances of where the railroads were building and the opportunities available. He opened lumber mills, shingle mills, planing mills, an electric plant, and other entities. He followed the railroads and opened mills in other locations in Oregon and Washington states. He and his associates built the Sumpter Valley and Mount Hood railroads. It was through these and other railroads that Eccles shipped the lumber and other goods to Utah.\n\nEccles met Ellen Stoddard, the daughter of his partner, John Stoddard. Under the practice of polygamy at the time, David married Ellen, and they made their home in Logan, Utah where he built a lavish yellow brick mansion for his new bride using lumber imported from his corporation in Oregon. (The home is on West Center Street.) Marriner Stoddard Eccles is a son of this marriage.\n\nEccles was a hard worker. He reported himself to have traveled over in 1904. While friends encouraged him to slow down, he preferred to \"die in the harness.\" One of his hallmarks was integrity and self-reliance. His companies prospered on his no debt plan, and view of achieving success rather than money.\n\nDavid always put his children to work early in life. They worked along with the crews on the railroads, mills, and lumber yards. They were taught as many aspects of the businesses as they were willing to learn. Several went and served missions for the LDS Church. One son graduated from University of Michigan Law School, another from Columbia University, others from Brigham Young College, Utah State University, and the University of Utah.\n\nWith the estimated 4-7 million dollars he made, mostly from his Oregon enterprises, he invested heavily in Utah. He purchased stock in banks, canneries, insurance companies, railroads, factories, mills, mines, and various other companies. The Utah Construction Company built over of track for the Western Pacific Railroad and led the Six Companies in constructing the Hoover Dam. David Eccles served as the second president of Utah Construction Company after the death of long-term associate Thomas Dee.

{"id": "5479497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5479497", "title": "Debt validation", "text": "Debt validation\n\nDebt validation, or \"debt verification\", refers to a consumer's right to challenge a debt and/or receive written verification of a debt from a debt collector. The right to dispute the debt and receive validation are part of the consumer's rights under the United States Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) and are set out in §809 of that act, which has been codified in Title 15, Section 1692-1692p of the United States Code. This debt validation procedure was expected\nto reduce the incidence of debt collectors dunning the wrong person or attempting to collect previously paid debts.\n\nUnder the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, any person or entity, including lawyers, who regularly attempts to collect consumer debts is considered a debt collector and is therefore required to respond to proper debt validation requests. In contrast, the original creditor and its employees are generally not subject to the FDCPA, though they may be regulated by other state and federal laws; including the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which was modified by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act in 2003. The original Act excluded lawyers from the definition of \"debt collector\" by explicitly exempting from any coverage “any attorney-at-law collecting a debt as an attorney on behalf of and in the name of a client.” The definition of \"debt collector\" was amended in 1986 to omit the prior exemption for attorneys. Despite the amendment, some attorneys maintained that litigation in an attempt to collect a debt did not bring them within the definition of \"debt collector\" in . This issue was not resolved until 1995, when the Supreme Court determined that the FDCPA applies to any attorneys who regularly engage in debt collection activity, even if it includes litigation.\n\nA consumer can dispute all or any part of a debt at any time, but only a written request sent within thirty days of receipt of the first written notice of the debt triggers validation rights under the FDCPA. requires specific information regarding the consumer's right to dispute all or part of the debt to be provided in writing to the consumer within 5 days of the initial communication. specifies the response required of a debt collector upon receipt of a timely written or oral dispute, most notably that it shall cease collection of the debt until the collector mails the consumer \"verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment, or the name and address of the original creditor, and a copy of such verification or judgment, or name and address of the original creditor.\"\n\nThus, there is no time limit for providing the required verification or other information, just that the collector must cease collection until it provides the required information. also contains a prohibition against the collection activities and communications during the initial 30 days of contact with the consumer overshadowing or being inconsistent with the consumer's right to dispute the debt or request the name and address of the original. provides that failure by the consumer to dispute the debt during the thirty-day period after the debt collector's initial communication with the consumer may not be construed by any court as an admission by the consumer that he is liable for the debt.\n\nThe FDCPA does not define what constitutes proper debt validation, and the issue has not been fully resolved by the courts. In the leading case of \"Chaudhry v. Gallerizzo\", the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals adopted a relatively low standard: \"Verification of a debt involves nothing more than the debt collector confirming in writing that the amount being demanded is what the creditor is claiming is owed; the debt collector is not required to keep detailed files of the alleged debt.\" The Court further stated that a request for validation of the debt is primarily intended to eliminate such problems as collectors contacting the wrong person or attempting to collect debts which have already been paid. In 2006, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals followed and adopted what they described as the \"reasonable standard\" articulated in Chaudhry.\n\nConsumer advocates have criticized the Chaudhry and Clark cases as setting too low a legal standard for validation and allowing debt collectors to justify providing little information in response to a dispute. In addition, some courts (such as the Court of Appeals of Indiana) have taken a stricter stance on debt validation than the Chuadhry Court, though the precedential value of such cases is uncertain.\n\nThere is no deadline for the debt collector to provide a response to the request for validation. However, a debt collector must cease all attempts to collect the debt until they have sent a sufficient response.\n\nIf a consumer makes a timely request for debt validation and a debt collector fails to provide proper validation or does not respond at all, the debt collector may not legally continue to pursue the debt. If collection activity continues, the consumer may file a lawsuit in state or federal court for violation of the FDCPA (see Fair Debt Collection Practices Act for discussion of FDCPA lawsuits).\n\nAny dispute of the debt must also be reported by the creditor on the consumer's credit report pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).\n\n\n"}

Volume I contains 1290 regulations, volume II contains appendices and forms and volume III contains alphabetically arranged subject wise index of regulations and appendices. It is incumbent upon every Magistrate to go through all regulations and appendices of which the regulations appended hereto are of high importance for the Executive Magistrate.\n\n(a) The Commissioner as the local head of the administration, shall exercise supervision and control over the action of the District Magistrate in police matters.\n(b) An order received from the Commissioner either direct or through the District magistrate shall be promptly executed by the Superintendent, who shall, however, report it through the Deputy Inspector General of the Range to the Inspector General if it is of an unusual nature.\n[§.12,Act v, 1861]\n\n(a) The Deputy Inspector-General of a Range shall keep in close touch with Commissioner and District Magistrates in regard to the maintenance of peace and the prevention and detection of crime in their respective charges and shall do all in his power to establish harmonious co-operation between the police and the magistracy.\n(b) He shall ordinarily communicate with the Commissioner by demi-official or unofficial notes and with District Magistrates through Superintendents but he shall make a point of having personal discussions with them at intervals, e.g., when he visits their Headquarters.\n\n\n(a) The Superintendent is the immediate head of the police force of the district and is responsible for all matters concerning its internal economy and management and for its efficiency and discipline. He is also responsible, subject to the general control of the District Magistrate, for the criminal administration of the district, and for the proper performance by officers subordinate to him of all preventive and executive duties.\n\n(b) The District Magistrate has no authority to interfere in the internal organisation and discipline of the police force, but it is his duty to bring to the notice of the Superintendent all cases in which the conduct and qualifications of a police officer affect the general administration of his district.\n\n(c) The District Magistrate may call for the papers relating to the conduct or character of any police officer of his district and may send them on to the Deputy Inspector-General of the Range for the information of the Inspector-General and Commissioner. He may direct an enquiry to be made into any case of misconduct of a police officer. The Superintendent shall submit to the District Magistrate the papers regarding all serious cases of misconduct and of cases likely to affect the relations of the police with the public.\n\n(d) All orders of the District Magistrate relating to the police except those passed in his judicial capacity, shall be addressed to the Superintendent, or in the event of his absence from Headquarters to the officer in charge during his absence. The Superintendent as the local head of the police under the District Magistrate is bound to carry out his orders except in regard to the internal economy organisation and discipline of the force, and matters of a purely departmental nature.\n\n(e) Should any difference of opinion on any question relating to the police administration arise between the Superintendent and the District Magistrate, it is the duty of the Superintendent to carry out the Magistrate's instructions. The Magistrate shall in such cases forth with refer the matter to the Commissioner and the Superintendent shall similarly make a reference to his Deputy inspector-General. The Commissioner and the Deputy Inspector-General shall consult together and, if possible, arrive at an agreed decision. If they are unable to agree, the matter shall be referred to the Provincial Government through the inspector-General\n\n(f) The District Magistrate, in the exercise of his power of control, shall abstain from any action likely to weaken the authority of the Superintendent or to deprive him of responsibility. For this reason he shall avoid, as far as possible, the issue of executive orders until he has consulted the Superintendent.\n\n(g) No circular or general order dealing with questions of law or procedure other than purely departmental matters may be issued by a Superintendent until it has been approved by the District Magistrate.\n\n(a) The Superintendent shall remain in constant personal communication with the District Magistrate whenever possible, and consult him on all important matters. It is incumbent on him to afford the District Magistrate all possible assistance in the criminal administration of the district, and in such matters he shall, as far as possible, accede to his wishes. Should any question arise on which they do not agree the District Magistrate shall give the Superintendent written orders and the Superintendent will carry them out; but the District Magistrate shall refer the point under dispute, if the Superintendent so desires, to the Deputy Inspector-General when the matter will be settled as laid down in regulation 15 (e).\n\n(b) The Superintendent shall keep the District Magistrate fully informed of all matters coming to his knowledge affecting the peace of the district, and when he is on tour the police officer in charge of Headquarters shall send direct to the District Magistrate all important information which would not reach him soon enough through the Superintendent.\n\n(c) Whenever he is about to leave the station, the Superintendent shall report his intention to the Magistrate, specifying, as far as possible, the places at which he may be found from day to day; and the Magistrate, for reasons to be recorded by him, may require the Superintendent to remain at Headquarters.\n\nCorrespondence between District Magistrates and Superinten¬dents shall be carried on by means of unofficial notes or memoranda. The original file shall be sent for action, when possible, and formal letters shall on no account be written.\n\n\nAll orders on the police, except judicial orders, issued by the office of the District Magistrate shall ordinarily be sent through the Superintendent. This includes orders relating to tours by the District Magistrate and other officers and the provision of supplies by the police. Similarly, orders issued by the Sub-divisional Magistrate shall be sent through the Sub-divisional Police Officer, or if there be no Sub-divisional Police Officer, through the Circle Inspector.\n\n\nThe District Magistrate shall exercise constant supervision over the prevention and detection of crime, for the proper conduct of which he is ultimately responsible. An important part of his duty is to inspect the police-stations of his district at regular intervals. It is not necessary for him to examine the details of the working of the department, but he should give special attention to—\n\n(i) the general diary and the manner in which it is written up;\n\n(ii) the recording of vital statistics;\n\n(iii) the proper working of the Arms Act;\n\n(iv) the methods of collecting crop statistics;\n\n(v) the working of the rural police;\n\n(vi) the general state of crime in the police-station and any reasons for its increase or decrease;\n\n(vii) whether the Sub-Inspector appears to have a proper knowledge of his duties, whether he is in touch with the respectable inhabitants of his charge, has acquired local knowledge, and takes an interest in his work;\n\n(viii) Whether the police-station officials appear to be working properly and have a proper knowledge of their duties and the neighbourhood;\n\n(ix) whether the police-station has been regularly and properly inspected.\n\n\n(a) If the District Magistrate observes in any police officer of or below the rank of Inspector marked incompetence or unfitness for the locality in which he is stationed, or unfitness for his particular duties, he may draw the attention of the Superintendent to the fact and request him to consider the advisability of transferring him to another locality or to other duties. He shall; however, bear in mind that not only are transfers detrimental to police work, but the officer transferred may do as badly or even worse in another place. Unsatisfactory work is as a rule met by punishment and a transfer should not be recommended unless it is likely to improve the criminal administration of the district as a whole.\n\n(b) If the Magistrate observes in any police officer above the rank of Inspector incompetence or unfitness he may communicate with the Inspector-General, who after paying careful attention to the views of the District Magistrate, shall determine what measures should be taken and shall inform the Magistrate of the action which he takes in the matter.\n\n\nPolice officers shall treat all courts and Magistrates with due respect.

{"id": "12870157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12870157", "title": "History of competition law", "text": "History of competition law\n\nThe history of competition law refers to attempts by governments to regulate competitive markets for goods and services, leading up to the modern competition or antitrust laws around the world today. The earliest records traces back to the efforts of Roman legislators to control price fluctuations and unfair trade practices. Throughout the Middle Ages in Europe, kings and queens repeatedly cracked down on monopolies, including those created through state legislation. The English common law doctrine of restraint of trade became the precursor to modern competition law. This grew out of the codifications of United States antitrust statutes, which in turn had considerable influence on the development of European Community competition laws after the Second World War. Increasingly the focus has moved to international competition enforcement in a globalised economy.\n\nLaws governing competition law are found in over two millennia of history. Roman Emperors and Mediaeval monarchs alike used tariffs to stabilise prices or support local production. The formal study of \"competition\", began in earnest during the 18th century with such works as Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations. Different terms were used to describe this area of the law, including \"restrictive practices\", \"the law of monopolies\", \"combination acts\" and the \"restraint of trade\".\n\nThe earliest surviving example of modern competition law's ancestors appears in the \"Lex Julia de Annona\", enacted during the Roman Republic around 50 BC. To protect the corn trade, heavy fines were imposed on anyone directly, deliberately and insidiously stopping supply ships. Under Diocletian, in 301 AD an Edict on maximum prices established a death penalty for anyone violating a tariff system, for example by buying up, concealing or contriving the scarcity of everyday goods. The most legislation came under the Constitution of Zeno of 483 AD which can be traced into Florentine Municipal laws of 1322 and 1325. It provided for property confiscation and banishment for any trade combinations or joint action of monopolies private \"or\" granted by the Emperor. Zeno rescinded all previously granted exclusive rights. Justinian I also introduced legislation not long after to pay officials to manage state monopolies. As Europe slipped into the Dark Ages, so did the records of law making until the Middle Ages brought greater expansion of trade in the time of \"lex mercatoria\".\n\nLegislation in England to control monopolies and restrictive practices were in force well before the Norman Conquest. The Domesday Book recorded that \"foresteel\" (i.e. forestalling, the practice of buying up goods before they reached market and then inflating the prices) was one of three forfeitures that King Edward the Confessor could carry out through England. Concern for fair prices also led to attempts to directly regulate the market. Under Henry III, an Act was passed in 1266 to fix bread and ale prices in correspondence with corn prices laid down by the assizes. Penalties for breach included amercements, pillory and tumbrel. A fourteenth century statute labelled forestallers as \"oppressors of the poor and the community at large and enemies of the whole country.\" Under King Edward III, the Statute of Labourers of 1349 fixed wages of artificers and workmen and decreed that foodstuffs should be sold at reasonable prices. On top of existing penalties, the statute stated that overcharging merchants must pay the injured party double the sum they received, an idea that has been replicated in punitive treble damages under US antitrust law. Also under Edward III, the following statutory provision in the poetic language of the time outlawed trade combinations.\n\n\"...we have ordained and established, that no merchant or other shall make Confederacy, Conspiracy, Coin, Imagination, or Murmur, or Evil Device in any point that may turn to the Impeachment, Disturbance, Defeating or Decay of the said Staples, or of anything that to them pertaineth, or may pertain.\"\n\nExamples of legislation in Europe include the \"constitutiones juris metallici\" by Wenceslas II of Bohemia between 1283 and 1305, condemning combinations of ore traders increasing prices; the Municipal Statutes of Florence in 1322 and 1325 followed Zeno's legislation against state monopolies; and under Emperor Charles V in the Holy Roman Empire a law was passed \"to prevent losses resulting from monopolies and improper contracts which many merchants and artisans made in the Netherlands.\" In 1553 King Henry VIII reintroduced tariffs for foodstuffs, designed to stabilise prices in the face of fluctuations in supply from overseas. The legislation read here that whereas,\n\n\"it is very hard and difficult to put certain prices to any such things... [it is necessary because] prices of such victuals be many times enhanced and raised by the Greedy Covetousness and Appetites of the Owners of such Victuals, by occasion of ingrossing and regrating the same, more than upon any reasonable or just ground or cause, to the great damage and impoverishing of the King's subjects.\"\n\nAround this time, organisations representing various tradesmen and handicraftspeople, known as guilds had been established and enjoyed many concessions and exemptions from the laws against monopolies. The privileges conferred were not abolished until the Municipal Corporations Act 1835.\n\nEurope around the 15th century was changing quickly. The new world had just been opened up, overseas trade and plunder was pouring wealth through the international economy and attitudes among businessmen were shifting. In 1561, a system of Industrial Monopoly Licences, similar to modern patents had been introduced into England. But by the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, the system was reputedly much abused and used merely to preserve privileges, encouraging nothing new in the way of innovation or manufacture. When a protest was made in the House of Commons and a Bill was introduced, the Queen convinced the protesters to challenge the case in the courts. This was the catalyst for the Case of Monopolies or \"Darcy v Allin\". The plaintiff, an officer of the Queen's household, had been granted the sole right of making playing cards and claimed damages for the defendant's infringement of this right. The court found the grant void and that three characteristics of monopoly were (1) price increases (2) quality decrease (3) the tendency to reduce artificers to idleness and beggary. This put a temporary end to complaints about monopoly, until King James I began to grant them again. In 1623 Parliament passed the Statute of Monopolies, which for the most part excluded patent rights from its prohibitions, as well as the guilds. From King Charles I, through the civil war and to King Charles II, monopolies continued, and were considered especially useful for raising revenue. Then in 1684, in \"East India Company v Sandys\" it was decided that exclusive rights to trade only outside the realm were legitimate on the grounds that only large and powerful concerns could trade in the conditions prevailing overseas. In 1710, to deal with high coal prices caused by a Newcastle Coal Monopoly, the New Law was passed. Its provisions stated that \"all and every contract or contracts, Covenants and Agreements, whether the same be in writing or not in writing...[between] persons whatsoever concerned the said Coal trade, for Ingrossing Coals, or for restraining or hindering any Person or Persons whomsoever from freely... disposing of Coals... are hereby declared to be illegal.\" When Adam Smith wrote the \"Wealth of Nations\" in 1776 he was somewhat cynical of the possibility for change.\n\n\"To expect indeed that freedom of trade should ever be entirely restored in Great Britain is as absurd as to expect that Oceana or Utopia should ever be established in it. Not only the prejudices of the public, but what is more unconquerable, the private interests of many individuals irresistibly oppose it. The Member of Parliament who supports any proposal for strengthening this Monopoly is seen to acquire not only the reputation for understanding trade, but great popularity and influence with an order of men whose members and wealth render them of great importance.\"\n\nThe English law of restraint of trade is the direct predecessor to modern competition law. Its current use is small, given modern and economically oriented statutes in most common law countries. Its approach was based on the two concepts of prohibiting agreements that ran counter to public policy, unless the reasonableness of an agreement could be shown. A restraint of trade is simply some kind of agreed provision that is designed to restrain another's trade. For example, in \"Nordenfelt v Maxim, Nordenfelt Gun Co\" a Swedish arms inventor promised on sale of his business to an American gun maker that he \"would not make guns or ammunition anywhere in the world, and would not compete with Maxim in any way.\"\n\nTo consider whether or not there is a restraint of trade in the first place, both parties must have provided valuable consideration for their agreement. In \"Dyer's case\" a dyer had given a bond not to exercise his trade in the same town as the plaintiff for six months but the plaintiff had promised nothing in return. On hearing the plaintiff's attempt to enforce this restraint, Hull J exclaimed:\n\n\"per Dieu, if the plaintiff were here, he should go to prison until he had paid a fine to the King.\"\n\nThe common law has evolved to reflect changing business conditions. So in the 1613 case of \"Rogers v Parry\" a court held that a joiner who promised not to trade from his house for 21 years could have this bond enforced against him since the time and place was certain. It was also held that a man cannot bind himself to not use his trade generally by Chief Justice Coke. This was followed in \"Broad v Jolyffe\" and \"Mitchel v Reynolds\" where Lord Macclesfield asked, \"What does it signify to a tradesman in London what another does in Newcastle?\" In times of such slow communications, commerce around the country it seemed axiomatic that a general restraint served no legitimate purpose for one's business and ought to be void. But already in 1880 in \"Roussillon v Roussillon\" Lord Justice Fry stated that a restraint unlimited in space need not be void, since the real question was whether it went further than necessary for the promisee's protection. So in the \"Nordenfelt\" case case Lord McNaughton rule that while one could validly promise to \"not make guns or ammunition anywhere in the world\" it was and unreasonable restraint to \"not compete with Maxim in any way.\" This approach in England was confirmed by the House of Lords in \"Mason v The Provident Supply and Clothing Co\"\n\nModern competition law begins with the United States legislation of the Sherman Act of 1890 and the Clayton Act of 1914. While other, particularly European, countries also had some form of regulation on monopolies and cartels, the U.S. codification of the common law position on restraint of trade had a widespread effect on subsequent competition law development. Both after World War II and after the fall of the Berlin wall, competition law has gone through phases of renewed attention and legislative updates around the world.\n\nThe American term anti-trust arose not because the U.S. statutes had anything to do with ordinary trust law, but because the large American corporations used trusts to conceal the nature of their business arrangements. Big trusts became synonymous with big monopolies, the perceived threat to democracy and the free market these trusts represented led passage of the Sherman and Clayton Acts. These laws, in part, codified past American and English common law of restraints of trade. Senator Hoar, an author of the Sherman Act said in a debate, \"We have affirmed the old doctrine of the common law in regard to all inter-state and international commercial transactions and have clothed the United States courts with authority to enforce that doctrine by injunction.\" Evidence of the common law basis of the Sherman and Clayton Acts is found in \"Standard Oil of New Jersey v. United States\", where Chief Justice White explicitly linked the Sherman Act with the common law and sixteenth-century English statutes on engrossing. The Act's wording also reflects common law. The first two sections read as follows,\n\n\"Section 1. Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any contract or engage in any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine...\n\nSection 2. Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine...\"\n\nThe Sherman Act did not have the immediate effects its authors intended, although Republican President Theodore Roosevelt's federal government sued 45 companies, and William Taft used it against 75 companies. The Clayton Act of 1914 was passed to supplement the Sherman Act. Specific categories of abusive conduct were listed, including price discrimination(section 2), exclusive dealings (section 3) and mergers which substantially lessened competition (section 7). Section 6 exempted trade unions from the law's operation. Both the Sherman and Clayton Acts are now codified under Title 15 of the United States Code.\n\n\nIt was after the First World War that countries began to follow the United States' lead in competition policy. In 1923, Canada introduced the Combines Investigation Act and in 1926 France reinforced its basic competition provisions from the 1810 Code Napoleon. After World War II, the Allies, led by the United States, introduced tight regulation of cartels and monopolies in occupied Germany and Japan. In Germany, despite the existence of laws against unfair business practices and unfair competition passed in 1909 (\"Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb\" or \"UWG\") it was widely believed that the predominance of large cartels of German industry had made it easier for the Nazis to assume total economic control simply by bribing or blackmailing the heads of a small number of industrial magnates. Similarly in Japan, where business was organised along family and nepotistic ties, the zaibatsu were easy for the government to manipulate into the war effort. Following World War II and the unconditional surrender of Japan and Germany, tighter controls, replicating the existing American policies and regulations were introduced.\n\nHowever, further developments were considerably overshadowed by the move towards nationalisation and industry-wide planning in many countries. Making the economy and industry democratically accountable through direct government action became a priority. Coal industry, railroads, steel, electricity, water, health care and many other sectors were targeted for their special qualities of being natural monopolies. Commonwealth countries were slow in enacting statutory competition law provisions. The United Kingdom introduced the (considerably less stringent) Restrictive Practices Act in 1956. Australia introduced its current Trade Practices Act in 1974. Recently however there has been a wave of updates, especially in Europe to harmonise legislation with contemporary competition law thinking.\n\nIn 1957 six Western European countries signed the Treaty of the European Community (EC Treaty or Treaty of Rome), which over the last fifty years has grown into a European Union of nearly half a billion citizens. The European Community is the name for the economic and social pillar of EU law, under which competition law falls. Healthy competition is seen as an essential element in the creation of a common market free from restraints on trade. The first provision is Article 81 EC, which deals with cartels and restrictive vertical agreements. Prohibited are...\n\n\"(1) ...all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which may affect trade between Member States and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the common market...\"\n\nArticle 81(1) EC then gives examples of \"hard core\" restrictive practices such as price fixing or market sharing and 81(2) EC confirms that any agreements are automatically void. However, just like the Statute of Monopolies 1623, Article 81(3) EC creates exemptions, if the collusion is for distributional or technological innovation, gives consumers a \"fair share\" of the benefit and does not include unreasonable restraints (or disproportionate, in ECJ terminology) that risk eliminating competition anywhere. Article 82 EC deals with monopolies, or more precisely firms who have a dominant market share and abuse that position. Unlike U.S. Antitrust, EC law has never been used to punish the existence of dominant firms, but merely imposes a special responsibility to conduct oneself appropriately. Specific categories of abuse listed in Article 82 EC include price discrimination and exclusive dealing, much the same as sections 2 and 3 of the U.S. Clayton Act. Also under Article 82 EC, the Council of the European Union was empowered to enact a regulation to control mergers between firms, currently the latest known by the abbreviation of ECMR \"Reg. 139/2004\". The general test is whether a concentration (i.e. merger or acquisition) with a community dimension (i.e. affects a number of EU member states) might significantly impede effective competition. Again, the similarity to the Clayton Act's substantial lessening of competition. Finally, Articles 86 and 87 EC regulate the state's role in the market. Article 86(2) EC states clearly that nothing in the rules can be used to obstruct a member state's right to deliver public services, but that otherwise public enterprises must play by the same rules on collusion and abuse of dominance as everyone else. Article 87 EC, similar to Article 81 EC, lays down a general rule that the state may not aid or subsidise private parties in distortion of free competition, but then grants exceptions for things like charities, natural disasters or regional development.\n\nCompetition law has already been substantially internationalised along the lines of the US model by nation states themselves, however the involvement of international organisations has been growing. Increasingly active at all international conferences are the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which is prone to making neo-liberal recommendations about the total application of competition law for public and private industries. Chapter 5 of the post war Havana Charter contained an Antitrust code but this was never incorporated into the WTO's forerunner, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1947. Office of Fair Trading Director and Professor Richard Whish wrote sceptically that it \"seems unlikely at the current stage of its development that the WTO will metamorphose into a global competition authority.\" Despite that, at the ongoing Doha round of trade talks for the World Trade Organization, discussion includes the prospect of competition law enforcement moving up to a global level. While it is incapable of enforcement itself, the newly established International Competition Network (ICN) is a way for national authorities to coordinate their own enforcement activities.\n\n\n"}

He is the founder of the Union of Polish Associations and Organizations in Latin America (pol. \"Unia Stowarzyszeń i Organizacji Polskich w Ameryce Łacińskiej, USOPAŁ\") the largest Polish immigrant organization of South America. He was a founder of one of the world's largest companies involved in editing postage stamps, and coins mintage. He has written books on philately, as well as on the mediation policy of the Roman Curia. He was formerly the honorary consul of Poland to Paraguay, and the honorary consul of Paraguay to Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain.\n\nKobylański was the son of Polish attorney at law Stanisław Kobylański. In 1943 he was arrested by the Nazis, and imprisoned at Warsaw's infamous Pawiak prison. He was a prisoner in the German concentration camps Mauthausen and Gross Rosen. After World War II, he moved to Italy, where he produced toothbrushes, and sold kitchen appliances. He became co-owner of the \"Astral Metal Technica\" company in Milan.\n\nIn 1952, he arrived in Paraguay, taking advantage of President Federico Chaves' immigration program, which allowed 18,000 families from Europe to settle in that country. Soon he won a contract to import kitchen appliances, and another to print postage stamps for the National Postal Service. In the next few years, he developed one of the world's largest stamp printing and coin minting companies.\n\nAccording to Polish journalists Jerzy Morawski and Mikołaj Lizut, Kobylański had a good relationship with Paraguayan president, General Alfredo Stroessner. Kobylański, however, denies this.\n\nFrom 1989 to 2000, Kobylański was an honorary Polish consul in Argentina. He was removed from office by Polish minister of foreign affairs Władysław Bartoszewski, after former Polish ambassadors to Uruguay and Costa Rica accused Kobylański of antisemitism and of acting against Polish interests Right wing Polish senators Jan Szafraniec, Ryszard Bender and Czesław Ryszka have since spoken up in his defence. He is a longtime sponsor of privately owned broadcast station Radio Maryja in Poland.\n\nKobylański helped to establish 8 June as the \"Day of the Polish Settler in Argentina\". He helped to fund monuments to John Paul II in Buenos Aires and Montevideo, as well as a monument to Frédéric Chopin in Punta del Este. He is a sponsor and patron of an elementary school in the region of Podlasie in Poland.\n\nIn 1995 Kobylański was awarded with the Krzyż Oświęcimski.\n\nIn 2004, a reporter for \"Gazeta Wyborcza\", Mikołaj Lizut, accused Kobylański of collaborating with the Nazis when Poland was occupied by German forces during World War II, which Kobylański denies. In 2005, the allegations were repeated by a columnist for \"Rzeczpospolita\", Jerzy Morawski. In 2004, the investigative section of the Instytut Pamięci Narodowej (IPN) began legal proceedings to determine if the accusations of handling over a Jewish family named Szenker to the Gestapo were true. A person named \"Janusz Kobylański\" was supposedly involved.\n\nIn April 2006 the chief of the investigative section of the IPN, Witold Kulesza, reported: \"so far, we have not found any evidence of the charges that... Jan Kobylański, handed over to the Germans a married Jewish couple.\"\n\nIn January 2007, the section of IPN in Warsaw reported that it had refused to re-open the investigation. In his explanation, the leading prosecutor recalled the testimonies of witnesses who decided not to testify against Kobylański:\n\nIn the winter of 1942-1943 Leokadia Sarnowska met Janusz Kobylański(...) During the conversation Janusz Kobylański said, that he was earning money producing false documents for Jews trying to hide themselves. Sarnowska soon sent the Szenker family to Kobylański, which consisted of three people - a married couple and their relative (...) Leokadia Sarnowska arranged the meeting of the two parties, during which Janusz Kobylański told Sarnowska and the Szenkers that false identity documents would be delivered for a certain sum of dollars in gold. The money was delivered to Judge Stanisław Juński, known to Sarnowska, who promised to give them to Kobylański after he delivered the money. Some days after the meeting Kobylański called Sarnowska and said, that the Szenker family had been arrested, and probably executed by the Germans, so he had to destroy the false documents that he had prepared.\nKobylański informed Sarnowska that Judge Juński, on the request of one of Szenkers, handed the money over to a \"Polish policeman\". Then Kobylański demanded payment from Sarnowska under threat of calling the Germans. Sarnowską delivered a part of the sum to Kobylański at once, and the second part was sent to an office of the father of Janusz Kobylański, att. Stanisław Kobylański (...) After some time one of the Szenker family called Judge Juński, and asked to arrange a meeting with Sarnowska, who immediately came to Warsaw to meet Szenker. Szenker told her that Kobylański denounced them to the Gestapo. According to his version, Gestapo officers went to the hostel where he stayed with his family, and showed him his personal notes, which he handed to Kobylański, hoping that it would help in the preparation of false documents. The Gestapo men ordered a Polish policeman to escort the Szenkers to the ghetto. On their way, Szenker convinced the policeman that he should free them for the money held in the judge's office. Policeman took the money from Juński and freed the Szenkers.\n\nStanisław Kobylański worked in Warsaw as a lawyer for the remainder of his life. Jan Kobylański, however, escaped from Poland to Western Europe, probably in 1945.\n\nAccording to documents collected by the Prosecutor's Office in Warsaw, the evidence that Jan Kobylański was the perpetrator in the denunciation of the Szenkers family cannot be proved. Legal proceedings against Stanisław Kobylański were denied, and those against Janusz Kobylański were suspended by the Regional Court in Warsaw on 31 June 1948. On April 19, 1955, prosecutors decided to cancel the case of Janusz Kobylański. Prosecutor Paweł Karolak of the IPN investigative section in Warsaw stated that his office was looking for evidence not only in Poland (archives, Museum of Auschwitz-Birkenau, Ministry of Foreign Affairs), but also in Germany (KL Gross-Rosen), Israel, and the United States as well. Furthermore, they found no evidence that \"Janusz Kobylański\" and \"Jan Kobylański\" were the same person.\n\nIn 2005, Mikołaj Lizut wrote in the \"Gazeta Wyborcza\" that Jan Kobylański falsified documents of the Red Cross, that he was a prisoner at Auschwitz, Mauthausen, Gusen, Gross Rosen, and Dachau concentration camps. Documents used by Kobylański, are different from those in the Auschwitz Museum.\n\nIn December 2007, the minister of Foreign Affairs, Radosław Sikorski, sent a message to Polish embassies abroad to discontinue contact with Kobylański. In late November 2008, two independent internet services reported that Kobylański was going to open a legal case against Polish politicians and journalists (among others against Adam Michnik, Jerzy Baczyński and Ryszard Schnepf) on charges of slander.\n"}

For an accounting system to support job costing, it must allow job numbers to be assigned to individual items of expenses and revenues. A job can be defined to be a specific project done for one customer, or a single unit of product manufactured, or a batch of units of the same type that are produced together.\n\nTo apply job costing in a manufacturing setting involves tracking which \"job\" uses various types of direct expenses such as direct labour and direct materials, and then allocating overhead costs (indirect labor, warranty costs, quality control and other overhead costs) to the jobs. A job profitability report is like an overall profit & loss statement for the firm, but is specific to each job number.\n\nJob costing may assess all costs involved in a construction \"job\" or in the manufacturing of goods done in discrete batches. These costs are recorded in ledger accounts throughout the life of the job or batch and are then summarized in the final trial balance before the preparing of the job cost or batch manufacturing statement.\n\nJob costing (known by some as job order costing) is fundamental to managerial accounting. It differs from Process costing in that the flow of costs is tracked by job or batch instead of by process.\n\nThe distinction between job costing and process costing hinges on the nature of the product and, therefore, on the type of production process:\n\nJob Costing is the process of determining the labor and materials cost for each job in a systematic way, and then using this information to create a quote for the customer. Job costing or cost accounting can be used in virtually any industry (especially service industry) to ensure that the product pricing covers actual costs, overhead and provides a profit. The purpose of any business is to make money, and job costing is the most effective way to ensure that occurs.In a job costing system, costs may be accumulated either by job or by batch. For a typical job, direct material, labor, subcontract costs, equipment, and other direct costs are tracked at their actual values. These are accrued until the job or batch is completed. Overhead or \"burden\" may be applied either by using a rate based on direct labor hours or by using some other Activity Based Costing (ABC) cost driver. In either case, once overhead/burden is added, the total cost for the job can be determined. If the accountant is using a general ledger accounting system, which lacks true job costing functionality, the costs must be manually transferred out of Work in Process to Finished Goods (Cost of Goods Sold for service industries). Of course, in the days of computerized job costing software, journaling costs manually is an obsolete process. Such hand-journaling is mandatory for companies that continue to use general accounting software to do job costing. Enlightened accountants are moving forward and using job costing software, thereby improving cost control, reducing risk, and increasing the chance of profitability.\n\nIn a true job cost accounting system, a Budget is set up in advance of the job. As actual costs are accrued, they are compared to budgeted costs, to determine variances for each phase of each job. Cost Codes are used for each phase, allowing \"mini-budgets\" to be generated and tracked. In the construction industry, the Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) has established an industry standard Cost Coding system. The job costing system consists of various cost drivers that drive job costs.\n\nThese examples will assume that overhead is allocated on the basis of Direct Labor Hours. Direct Material is abbreviated DM, Direct Labor as DL, and Overhead as OH.\n\nXYZ corporation manufactures airplanes. 1 order was completed (#110), 2 received further work (#111, 112), and 1 new order was received (#113). Overhead is allocated at a rate of $100/DL Hour. All employees earn $20/hour. Beginning Work In Process Balances are as follows: #110, $25,000; #111, $10,000; #112, $12,000; #113 $0 (New Order). Below are the amounts of DM and DL used.\n\n\nCaution: Remember, overhead is allocated on the basis of DL hours. While in this case, allocating overhead on the basis of DL cost ($5 of overhead for every $1 DL cost) would produce the same result, this may not always be the case. Since rates are developed based on a budget, if employees are actually paid a different rate from the budgeted rate, allocating at a $5 to $1 ratio would produce a different cost from the stated $100/DL hour allocation. Companies use slightly different overhead allocation methods.\n\n"}

In some cases, these names actually refer to different lens designs and technologies implemented; however, the great majority are simply re-branded lenses originally known by another name. In recent decades, it has generally been considered a cliché throwback, and thus the generic name of \"anamorphic format\" has become predominant.\n\nAll of the following trade names refer to the modern SMPTE-standard anamorphic 35 mm format or what was regarded as the standard at that time.

The change from 2.35:1 to 2.39:1 (sometimes rounded to 2.4:1 or, mathematically incorrectly, to 2.40:1) was mainly intended to facilitate \"negative assembly\", and also to better hide \"negative assembly\" splices, which otherwise may appear as a slight \"flash\" at the upper edge of the frame, during a splice.

Military logistical systems, however, continued to rely on 19th century technology.\n\nThe main method of transportation of supplies at the start of the war was still by horse due to the lack of available alternatives in 1914, similar to that of the inclusion of cavalry within the armed forces, and the fast pace of the war in the first part of the war. When World War I started, the capabilities of rail and horse-drawn supply were stretched to their limits. As the war progressed it became increasingly difficult to supply soldiers in the traditional way by horse and carriage due to conditions at the front. The supply routes became muddy and impassable, improvement to artillery on both sides and other tactics meant that supplies became increasingly delivered under cover of night and were considerably slowed down.\n\nHowever, as the war ground down into static trench warfare it became easier for armies to support their troops with the use of the railway, especially for the artillery. This made the transportation of supplies easier and quicker to get from the factories to the front line. This did have problems of their own, as seen by the Shell Crisis of 1915. Where the stalemate of trench warfare took hold, special narrow gauge trench railways were built to extend the rail network to the front lines. The great size of the German Army proved too much for its railways to support except while immobile. Tactical successes like Operation Michael devolved into operational failures where logistics failed to keep up with the army's advance over shell-torn ground. \n\nOn the seas, the British blockade of Germany kept a stranglehold on raw materials, goods, and food needed to support Germany's war efforts, and is considered one of the key elements in the eventual Allied victory in the war. On the Allied Side a huge producer of supplies was the United States of America, meaning the supplies had to be transported over the Atlantic Ocean to England and France. At the same time, Germany's unrestricted submarine warfare showed the vulnerability of shipping lanes despite Allied naval superiority. This revolutionised how war shipping was conducted and saw the first use of military convoys to counter the threat caused by German U-Boats.\n\nIn June 1918 the Allies organized the Military Board of Allied Supply, which proved to be an invaluable mechanism for coordinating logistical requirements for armies working in close proximity during the final battles that autumn. The Board’s report contains overviews of the logistical systems for the principal Allied armies.\n\nThe trans-Atlantic distances and the American inexperience at large scale operations combined to make support of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) extraordinarily difficult. Mass production of munitions, including cargo ships, did not reach full potential until near the end of the war. In the meantime, the United States relied upon European allies for most weapons and upon Britain for shipping. In France, the Americans built or improved ports, railroads, depots, and other facilities to move the supplies to the front. Slowly the Americans learned the multiple functions associated with supporting a large-scale conflict, which allowed the AEF to operate as a independent force. Experience gained in World War I proved invaluable during later conflicts.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35227726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35227726", "title": "Management accounting in supply chains", "text": "Management accounting in supply chains\n\nManagement accounting in supply chains (or supply chain controlling, SCC) is part of the supply chain management concept. This necessitates planning, monitoring, management and information about logistics and manufacturing processes throughout the value chain. The goal of management accounting in supply chains is optimizing these processes. This strategy focuses on supporting management.\n\nAs value chains become more complex due to globalization, supply chain management (SCM) has become increasingly relevant in theory and practice. SCM encompasses extensive management-control tasks. This range of subjects is summarized by the definition of supply-chain controlling. The transfer of existing management control systems (MCM) to the SCM is insufficient because these primarily aim at internal (company) needs. Beyond past-oriented, financial figures there must also be future-oriented measurement; a number of approaches exist in the literature.\n\nSupply-chain management (SCM) has become increasingly relevant in theory and practice in light of more-complex supply chains. The SCM performs extensive operational tasks, including supply-chain controlling. Seuring transfers the three main concepts of German supply chain-controlling literature into the specific demands of SCM:\n\nThe rationality-oriented approach of supply-chain controlling coordinates all participants in the supply chain to improve performance. Common management systems and instruments for performance measurement are developed, enabling guidance for individual companies and the entire supply chain. The coordination-oriented approach supports the supply-chain leadership. Organizational objectives include the selection of strategic partners, the distribution of tasks among companies, process management and ensuring the provision of information to all participants. The information-oriented supply-chain controlling concept emphasizes providing partners with relevant information for decision-making. An efficient reporting structure must be implemented, including strategic and operative organizations in the system and their technical aspects.\n\nA requirement for the supply chain is the support of cooperating companies, ensuring future cooperation; companies must focus on common tools and targets. For this, an understanding of processes within the participating companies is indispensable. Information exchange (including sensitive data) within a supply chain is necessary to ensure its control, with coordination among in-house information systems. The requirements for management accounting in supply chains are significantly higher than the provision of key figures, but this is a fundamental task.\n\nThe tasks and functions of controlling may be transferred to management accounting in supply chains, supplemented by a cross-company approach. However, the past-oriented aspects of the traditional concept are inappropriate. Due to the strategic importance of supply-chain management, forward-looking control requirements must be taken into account. Because of the complexity of a supply chain, a focus on interface management is necessary. In the literature, several tasks and functions are defined. Management accounting in supply chains has the following features:\n\nBecause of different controlling directions, in management accounting of supply chains different aims are pursued and influence each other. Again, the challenge is the cross-company factor. Independent companies must agree on a common strategy for the SCM and define common aims. Two types of aims exist: direct and indirect.\n\nDirect aims relate to the support of SCM and controlling. This ensures logistical processes between parties in a supply chain or the introduction of a common performance-measurement system for verification of lead times.\n\nCompany-wide, generalized aims may be pursued with management accounting in supply chains. Examples are competitiveness, expanding cooperation, growth, market development and greater customer orientation.\n\nManagement accounting in supply chains draws on modified traditional instruments of managerial accounting to accomplish cross-company objectives. There are two measuring instruments: the supply-chain map and the supply-chain operations reference (SCOR).\n\nThe basic model of the balanced scorecard (BSC) was introduced by Kaplan and Norton in 1992. The BSC aims to achieve a balance between non-financial and financial measures. To use the scorecard in a cross-company context, several modifications of content and structure are necessary. The BSC consists of four generic perspectives, which are geared to the individual company. According to this, a generally accepted framework does not exist. From a common strategy, the supply-chain scorecard (SCS) maps cross-company measures. Brewer and Speh note that focusing on the supply chain requires four perspectives: \nIndependent of perspective, each should include internal and cross-company measures.\n\nActivity-based costing is a model to assign indirect costs into direct ones. To use this model in the context of supply chains, there must be consistent defined and delimited cost and performance data. Since many companies participate in more than one supply chain, standardization across the sector is beneficial. Compatibility of information technology is important for improved data transfer, so manual entry is limited and high availability guaranteed. Several changes result from cross-company activity-based costing:\n\nA primary task of management accounting in supply chains is performance measurement. The key elements of strategic goals include the measurement of resources, output and flexibility. Efficient resource management is critical to profitability; without an acceptable output, customers will turn to other supply chains. In a changing environment, supply chains must adapt.\nMeasures for resource performance include total costs, distribution costs, manufacturing costs, measures of inventory and rate of return. Examples of performance measures are numbers of items produced, time required to produce, customer satisfaction and product quality (which is difficult to express numerically). Reductions in back orders, increased customer satisfaction and the ability to accommodate demand variations are advantages associated with flexibility.\n\n\n"}

He served as the president of the secessionist State of Katanga from 1960 to 1963 and as prime minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 1964 to 1965.\n\nA member of the Lunda tribes, Tshombe was born near Musumba, Belgian Congo, the son of a successful businessman. He received his education from an American missionary school and later trained as an accountant. In the 1950s, he took over a chain of stores in Katanga Province and became involved in politics.\n\nHe founded the Confédération des associations tribales du Katanga (CONAKAT) party, with Godefroid Munongo. CONAKAT promoted a federal Congo independent of the Belgian colonial empire.\n\nCONAKAT won control of the Katanga provincial legislature in the May 1960 general elections. One month later, the Congo became an independent republic. Tshombe became President of Katanga.\n\nIn the resulting strife and chaos following independence, CONAKAT declared the State of Katanga's secession from the rest of the Congo. The Christian, anti-communist pro-Western Tshombe declared, \"We are seceding from chaos.\" Favoring continued ties with Belgium, he asked the Belgian government to send military officers to recruit and train a Katangese army.\n\nTshombe demanded UN recognition for independent Katanga, and he announced that any intervention by UN troops would be met with force. Nonetheless, Congolese Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba and his successor, Cyrille Adoula, successfully requested intervention from UN forces. UN forces were sent under the direction of UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld.\n\nLumumba's government was overthrown, and Lumumba taken prisoner by Mobutu and detained at Camp Hardy in Thysville. (Belgian minister for African Affairs) sent a highly confidential telegram on 16 January 1961 to the government in Léopoldville (President Joseph Kasa-Vubu and Mobutu) to send Lumumba to Katanga. That would have stemmed from Lumumba's increasing popularity among soldiers, who might release him. Meanwhile, soldier mutinies and unrest increased by the day, at Prison Camp Hardy in Thysville. The telegram has still not been shown to exist.\n\nWhile being flown in a Sabena DC-4 air plane to Katanga, Lumumba was beaten by the Congolese soldiers escorting him. In custody in Katanga, Lumumba was visited by Katangese notables and Belgian officers, who included Tshombe, Godefroid Munongo, Kibwe, Kitenge, Grandelet, Son, Gat, Huyghé, Tignée, Verscheure, Segers and Rougefort. Lumumba's execution was carried out by a firing squad led by a Belgian mercenary, Julien Gat.\n\nIn 1963, UN forces succeeded in suppressing Katanga, driving Tshombe into exile in Northern Rhodesia, later to Spain. In July 1964, he returned to the Congo to serve as prime minister in a new coalition government. Tshombe's national support was derived from the backing of provincial political bosses, customary chiefs, and foreign financial interests. He was dismissed from his position in October 1965 by President Kasa-Vubu. In late 1965, General Mobutu, who had staged a successful coup against Kasa-Vubu, brought charges of treason against Tshombe, who again fled the country and settled in Francoist Spain.\n\nIn 1967, he was sentenced to death \"in absentia\". On 30 June 1967, he was in a Hawker Siddeley jet aircraft that was hijacked by Francis Bodenan, an agent of the SDECE of France. According to the Congolese government, Tshombe was going to Africa.\n\nTshombe was taken to Algeria, jailed, and placed under house arrest. The pilots of the plane, Britons Trevor Coppleston and David Taylor, were released and returned to the United Kingdom. The Congolese government demanded his extradition to Congo, and his Western supporters agitated for his release. The Algerians resisted both demands.\n\nTshombe died in 1969, the official cause of death was listed as \"death from heart failure\". He was buried in a Methodist service at Etterbeek Cemetery, near Brussels, Belgium. Due to his role in the death of Lumumba and association with Western interests, Tshombe's surname became synonymous with \"sellout\" to black African nationalists.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "38588548", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38588548", "title": "MySuper", "text": "MySuper\n\nMySuper is part of the Stronger Super reforms announced in September 2011 by the Gillard Labor government for the Australian superannuation industry to replace the previous default funds system with a new default system using low cost and simple superannuation products. MySuper compliant products may be provided by industry super funds, as well as retail super funds. Funds that do not operate as default funds, such as self managed superannuation funds (SMSFs) or choice products, are not subject to MySuper standards.\n\nSince 1 January 2014, unless an employee has chosen another investment option, employers must pay all compulsory SG contributions into approved MySuper accounts, ie., into super products that have received a MySuper authority. From that date, super funds must also credit employer contributions to a MySuper account, unless if the member has directed the trustee to do otherwise. Given that over 75% of employees stay with their employers’ default fund, it was expected that the majority of employees would be in a MySuper product from that date. Superannuation funds had until 1 July 2017 to move existing default members into a complying MySuper product. For convenience, many funds simply converted an existing default option to a MySuper account, so that members would be automatically included in a MySuper product. \n\nMembers can opt out of the MySuper option at any time, or may chose a particular MySuper product. They must be given a minimum of 90 days' notice before a default transfer to a MySuper account is made.\n\nThe intention of the MySuper system is for market participants to create a range of easily comparable, relatively simple products, which in turn will focus competition on net costs and returns. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) fosters competition by publishing fee tables and other statistics.\n\nThe features of a MySuper product include:\n\nMySuper products are required to have a single investment option. Many funds, such as HESTA and CBUS, have announced that they will simply use their existing default investment option as their MySuper offering – typically Balanced or Growth. An estimated 80% of not-for-profit funds will reportedly retain their existing products for MySuper. This enables a simple transition to the MySuper regime. However, critics of this approach argue that offering a single investment option that doesn't change over an entire working life and into retirement does not reflect customers' changing attitudes to risk as they age nor as their retirement prospects change.\n\nFor these reasons, the government has allowed lifecycle investment options to be the default choice for a MySuper product. Lifecycle investment options enable trustees to automatically move members into a different investment mix based on their age and other permitted factors including balance, gender, time to retirement (or combination thereof), and can be particularly relevant as part of a transition to retirement. Sunsuper was the first fund to receive approval for their lifecycle strategy. However, a number of lifecycle strategies have since been released from companies including Aon, Suncorp, BT and First State.\n\nFees a member can be charged in MySuper products are limited to:\n\nIn addition, trustees may charge fees for certain member‑specific costs initiated by the member or a court; for example, account splitting following a family law decision. \nAll fees charged for MySuper products must be able to be included under these standard descriptions. This will make it simpler for members to understand what they pay and to compare fees against other MySuper products.\n\nMySuper products are required to offer a standard, default level of life and total and permanent disability (TPD) insurance. Members of MySuper products are able to opt-out of the insurance, or increase or decrease their insurance cover (if offered by the trustee) without having to leave the MySuper product.\nThere may be particular factors at a workplace level that influence the appropriate level and structure of insurance for employees at that workplace. Therefore, within a MySuper product, it is possible for the standard insurance cover to be replaced by a default insurance strategy tailored to meet the specific requirements of the employees of a particular employer.\n\nAfter 1 January 2014, members who do not make an investment choice, or who actively choose a fund's default option, must be invested in a complying MySuper product.\n\nOn 14 February 2013, Sunsuper was the first superannuation fund to receive a MySuper authority. On 20 February 2013, Cbus was the second fund to receive an authority. A complete list of MySuper authorities is listed on the APRA website. APRA had anticipates that fewer than 120 MySuper authorities would be granted in total by the mandatory start date of 1 January 2014, which has been revised down from earlier estimates. As at 6 January 2014, 115 funds had been granted a MySuper authority:\n\n\nThe URL www.mysuper.com.au is registered to OnePath Australia Limited.\n\n"}

{"id": "47368284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47368284", "title": "Provisional liquidation", "text": "Provisional liquidation\n\nProvisional liquidation is a process which exists as part of the corporate insolvency laws of a number of common law jurisdictions whereby after the lodging of a petition for the winding-up of a company by the court, but before the court hears and determines the petition, the court may appoint a liquidator on a \"provisional\" basis. (The provisional liquidator is appointed to safeguard the assets of the company and maintain the \"status quo\" pending the hearing of the petition.) Unlike a conventional liquidator, a provisional liquidator does not assess claims against the company or try to distribute the company's assets to creditors.\n\nIn practice most instances of applications for a provisional liquidator involve some type of allegation of fraud or other misconduct relating to the company.\n\nTypically, an application for the appointment of a provisional liquidator is made by either:\n\nThe remedy is an exceptional one, and most instances of applications for a provisional liquidator are made because of concerns about some type of material impropriety. In exceptional cases it is also possible for public authorities to apply for the appointment of a provisional liquidator to protect the public interest from fraud or other similar conduct, although this is much less common.\n\nThe court invariably has a discretion whether to appoint a provisional liquidator. A court will not normally approve the application unless it is satisfied that there is a strong liklihood that a liquidator will be appointed on the substantive application. But even if the company is likely to go into liquidation, provisional liquidation is still an exceptional interim or \"emergency remedy\". There needs to be special reasons for the appointment of a provisional liquidator in the interim period. Normally this is because the assets must face a high risk of dissipation or there must be some other urgent reason why a liquidator is required for the interim period.\n\nApplications are most likely to be granted in situations where:\n\nConversely, because there needs to be some urgency or risk of dissipation of assets, applications are likely to be refused if:\n\nGiven their nature, applications for provisional liquidation are often made urgently and without giving notice to the company or its directors. Where the application is made without notice:\n\nIf the court makes the order then a provisional liquidator is appointed over the company, and the control of all assets of the company, and the conduct of any business and other affairs of the company are transferred to the provisional liquidator. The directors cease to have any authority. In almost all jurisdictions, the provisional liquidator will normally have to be a licensed insovency practitioner. \n\nThe provisional liquidator will generally only have the powers and functions conferred upon him or her by the order of the court. It is not normally part of the role of a provisional liquidator to collect and sell the assets of the company, or otherwise take steps in relation to the actual winding up the company. The principal reason for the appointment is the preservation of the company's property.\n\nOne of the common functions of a provisional liquidator is to investigate whether the company's property has been misappropriated or its business has been wrongfully conducted. But generally speaking a provisional liquidator will not have power to bring proceedings on behalf of the company for wrongful trading, or to challenge transactions as undervalue transactions or unfair preferences.\n\nProvisional liquidation will normally come to an end in one of three ways:\n\nThe effect of provisional liquidation varies from jurisdiction to the jurisdiction.\n\nIn Australia provisional liquidation is regulated by section 472(2) of Corporations Act 2001. In Australia provisional liquidators must be licensed insolvency practitioners.\n\nUnder British Virgin Islands law provisional liquidation is regulated by section 170(4) of the Insolvency Act 2003. In \"Akai Holdings Limited v Brinlow Investments Limited\" it was held that an applicant would need to show four things:\n\nIn Canada provision liquidation is regulated under section 28 of the Winding-up and Restructuring Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. W-11).\n\nIn the Cayman Islands provisional liquidation is principally regulated by section 104(3) of the Companies Law (2013) Revision. One unusual feature of provisional liquidation in Cayman is that it is possible to appoint a provisional liquidator and still allow the directors to retain their powers of management. This in part facilitates a slightly unusual use of provisional liquidation in the Cayman Islands as part of a debtor in possession corporate rehabilitation prcoess. The company itself will apply for an order for provisional liquidation, and provisional liquidators are appointed which effectively creates a stay on the claims of unsecured creditors. The board of directors can then use that \"breathing space\" to try and implement a restructuring of the company's debts pursuant to a scheme of arrangement, or pursuant to an international restructuring process in the courts of another jurisdictions. This approach has not been rejected in the courts of other jurisdictions (such as Hong Kong), but accepted in others.\n\nIn Hong Kong there are three types of provisional liquidators. There are \"traditional\" provisional liquidators, appointed under section 193 of the Hong Kong Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap 32); there are also provisional liquidators appointed pursuant to a members' voluntary liquidation under section 228A of the Ordinance, and there are \"Panel T\" appointments under section 194(1A) of the Ordinance whereby the Official Receiver is appointed as provisional liquidator. \n\nSince the decision in the \"Legend\" case in 2006 provisional liquidation may not be used as a means of shielding the company from creditor's claims to facilitate a restructuring in Hong Kong, although prior to that date the practice was relatively common.\n\nIn South Africa \"provisional liquidation\" has a very different meaning. When a creditor or other person applies to the court for the liquidation of a business, then the order is first made a provisional basis, and then subsequent confirmed (or not) at a full hearing, much like a \"decree nisi\" and a \"decree absolut\" in other jurisdictions.\n\nIn the United Kingdom the power to appoint a provisional liquidator is found in section 135(1), of the Insolvency Act 1986, and it is regarded as an \"emergency procedure\". The categories of persons who may apply for the appointment are set out at rule 4.25(1) of the Insolvency Rules 1986. Under English law all provisional liquidators are required to be licensed insolvency practitioners. \nIf, upon the application for the appointment of a liquidator, there are concerns about potential dissipation of assets, or misconduct on the part of the directors, then the court may order the appointment of a provisional liquidator. Provisional liquidation is essentially an \n\"emergency procedure\". A provisional liquidator may only be appointed by the court only after a winding-up petition has been presented The main reason for appointing a provisional liquidator is normally to preserve the company's assets. In practice most instances of applications for a provisional liquidator involve some kind of fraud or other misconduct. The applicant will normally need to show that (a) it is likely that a winding up order will be made at the hearing of the petition; and (b) the company's assets are at risk prior to the hearing of the petition (which includes either dissipation of the company's assets, or the potential loss or destruction of the company's books and records. Accordingly, it will normally be necessary to establish either (or both) that: (a) the company is clearly insolvent, and it is likely that a winding up order will be made at the hearing of the petition; and/or (b) there has been the type of misconduct that would justify a just and equitable winding-up. An appointment of a provisional liquidator may also be made where it is in the public interest.\n\nBecause of the emergency nature of the remedy applications for provisional liquidation are very often made urgently and without giving notice to the company. In such cases the applicant is under a legal obligation to give full and frank disclosure to the court of all material facts, including facts which are adverse to the applicant's own case. The applicant will also normally be required to give an undertaking in damages in the event the court subsequently determines that the order should not have been made to compensate the company for any damage caused to it by the appointment.\n\nIf a provisional liquidator is appointed then the powers of the company's directors are effectively terminated, and the board will retain only a residual power to apply to dismiss or resist the winding-up petition. The appointment of a provisional liquidator comes to an end when:\n"}

{"id": "34340129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34340129", "title": "Specification by example", "text": "Specification by example\n\nSpecification by example (SBE) is a collaborative approach to defining requirements and business-oriented functional tests for software products based on capturing and illustrating requirements using realistic examples instead of abstract statements. It is applied in the context of agile software development methods, in particular behavior-driven development. This approach is particularly successful for managing requirements and functional tests on large-scale projects of significant domain and organisational complexity.\n\nSpecification by example is also known as example-driven development, executable requirements, acceptance test–driven development (ATDD or A-TDD), Agile Acceptance Testing, Test-Driven Requirements (TDR).\n\nHuman brains are generally not that great at understanding abstractions or novel ideas/concepts when first exposed to them, but they’re really good at deriving abstractions or concepts if given enough concrete examples. The more examples we are given, the more likely we are to correctly understand the intended meaning. Also, by using \"concrete\" examples, they become more familiar and relatable to something similar to our past experiences, which generally makes them easier to understand.\n\nSuccessful application of Specification by example is documented to significantly reduce feedback loops in software development, leading to less rework, higher product quality, faster turnaround time for software changes and better alignment of activities of various roles involved in software development such as testers, analysts and developers.\n\nA key aspect of specification by example is creating a single source of truth about required changes from all perspectives. When business analysts work on their own documents, software developers maintain their own documentation and testers maintain a separate set of functional tests, software delivery effectiveness is significantly reduced by the need to constantly coordinate and synchronise those different versions of truth. With short iterative cycles, such coordination is often required on weekly or biweekly basis. With Specification by example, different roles participate in creating a single source of truth that captures everyone's understanding. Examples are used to provide clarity and precision, so that the same information can be used both as a specification and a business-oriented functional test. Any additional information discovered during development or delivery, such as clarification of functional gaps, missing or incomplete requirements or additional tests, is added to this single source of truth. As there is only one source of truth about the functionality, there is no need for coordination, translation and interpretation of knowledge inside the delivery cycle.\n\nWhen applied to required changes, a refined set of examples is effectively a specification and a business-oriented test for acceptance of software functionality. After the change is implemented, specification with examples becomes a document explaining existing functionality. As the validation of such documents is automated, when they are validated frequently, such documents are a reliable source of information on business functionality of underlying software. To distinguish between such documents and typical printed documentation, which quickly gets outdated, a complete set of specifications with examples is called Living Documentation.\n\nTeams that apply Specification by example successfully commonly apply the following process patterns:\n\nSoftware teams that apply specification by example within a Scrum framework typically spend 5%-10% of their time in refining the product backlog, including specifying collaboratively, illustrating requirements using examples and refining examples.\n\nSpecification by example applies to projects with sufficient organisational and domain complexity to cause problems in understanding or communicating requirements from a business domain perspective. It does not apply to purely technical problems or where the key complexity is not in understanding or communicating knowledge. There are documented usages of this approach in domains including investment banking, financial trading, insurance, airline ticket reservation, online gaming and price comparison. A similar approach is documented also in a nuclear-power plant simulation project.\n\nTests based on shared examples fit best in the category of tests designed to support a team while delivering software from a business perspective (see Agile Testing Quadrants) - ensuring that the right product is built. They do not replace tests that look at a software system from a purely technical perspective (those that evaluate whether a product is built the right way, such as unit tests, component or technical integration tests) or tests that evaluate a product after it was developed (such as security penetration tests).\n\nThe earliest documented usage of realistic examples as a single source of truth, requirements and automated tests, on software projects is the WyCash+ project, described by Ward Cunningham in the paper A Pattern Language of Competitive Development in 1996. The name Specification by Example was coined by Martin Fowler in 2004.\n\nSpecification by Example is an evolution of the Customer Test practice of Extreme Programming proposed in 1999 and Ubiquitous Language idea from Domain-driven design from 2004, using the idea of black-box tests as requirements described by Weinberg and Gause in 1989.\n\nSuccessful application of Specification by example on large scale projects requires frequent validation of software functionality against a large set of examples (tests). In practice, this requires tests based on examples to be automated. A common approach is to automate the tests but keep examples in a form readable and accessible to non-technical and technical team members, keeping the examples as a single source of truth. This process is supported by a class of test automation tools which work with tests divided into two aspects - the specification and the automation layer. The specification of a test which is often in a plain text or HTML form and contains the examples and auxiliary descriptions. The automation layer connects the example to a software system under test. Examples of such tools are:\n\n"}

Strategy is defined as \"the determination of the basic long-term goals of an enterprise, and the adoption of courses of action and the allocation of resources necessary for carrying out these goals.\" Strategies are established to set direction, focus effort, define or clarify the organization, and provide consistency or guidance in response to the environment.\n\nStrategic management involves the related concepts of strategic planning and strategic thinking. Strategic planning is analytical in nature and refers to formalized procedures to produce the data and analyses used as inputs for strategic thinking, which synthesizes the data resulting in the strategy. Strategic planning may also refer to control mechanisms used to implement the strategy once it is determined. In other words, strategic planning happens \"around\" the strategic thinking or strategy making activity.\n\nStrategic management is often described as involving two major processes: \"formulation\" and \"implementation\" of strategy. While described sequentially below, in practice the two processes are iterative and each provides input for the other.\n\n\"Formulation\" of strategy involves analyzing the environment in which the organization operates, then making a series of strategic decisions about how the organization will compete. Formulation ends with a series of goals or objectives and measures for the organization to pursue. \nEnvironmental analysis includes the:\n\n\"Strategic decisions\" are based on insight from the environmental assessment and are responses to strategic questions about how the organization will compete, such as:\n\nThe answers to these and many other strategic questions result in the organization's strategy and a series of specific short-term and long-term goals or objectives and related measures.\n\nThe second major process of strategic management is \"implementation\", which involves decisions regarding how the organization's resources (i.e., people, process and IT systems) will be aligned and mobilized towards the objectives. Implementation results in how the organization's resources are structured (such as by product or service or geography), leadership arrangements, communication, incentives, and monitoring mechanisms to track progress towards objectives, among others.\n\nRunning the day-to-day operations of the business is often referred to as \"operations management\" or specific terms for key departments or functions, such as \"logistics management\" or \"marketing management,\" which take over once strategic management decisions are implemented.\n\nIn 1988, Henry Mintzberg described the many different definitions and perspectives on strategy reflected in both academic research and in practice. He examined the strategic process and concluded it was much more fluid and unpredictable than people had thought. Because of this, he could not point to one process that could be called strategic planning. Instead Mintzberg concludes that there are five types of strategies:\n\nIn 1998, Mintzberg developed these five types of management strategy into 10 “schools of thought” and grouped them into three categories. The first group is normative. It consists of the schools of informal design and conception, the formal planning, and analytical positioning. The second group, consisting of six schools, is more concerned with how strategic management is actually done, rather than prescribing optimal plans or positions. The six schools are entrepreneurial, visionary, cognitive, learning/adaptive/emergent, negotiation, corporate culture and business environment. The third and final group consists of one school, the configuration or transformation school, a hybrid of the other schools organized into stages, organizational life cycles, or “episodes”.\n\nMichael Porter defined strategy in 1980 as the \"...broad formula for how a business is going to compete, what its goals should be, and what policies will be needed to carry out those goals\" and the \"...combination of the \"ends\" (goals) for which the firm is striving and the \"means\" (policies) by which it is seeking to get there.\" He continued that: \"The essence of formulating competitive strategy is relating a company to its environment.\"\n\nSome complexity theorists define strategy as the unfolding of the internal and external aspects of the organization that results in actions in a socio-economic context.\n\nThe strategic management discipline originated in the 1950s and 1960s. Among the numerous early contributors, the most influential were Peter Drucker, Philip Selznick, Alfred Chandler, Igor Ansoff, and Bruce Henderson. The discipline draws from earlier thinking and texts on 'strategy' dating back thousands of years. Prior to 1960, the term \"strategy\" was primarily used regarding war and politics, not business. Many companies built strategic planning functions to develop and execute the formulation and implementation processes during the 1960s.\n\nPeter Drucker was a prolific management theorist and author of dozens of management books, with a career spanning five decades. He addressed fundamental strategic questions in a 1954 book \"The Practice of Management\" writing: \"... the first responsibility of top management is to ask the question 'what is our business?' and to make sure it is carefully studied and correctly answered.\" He wrote that the answer was determined by the customer. He recommended eight areas where objectives should be set, such as market standing, innovation, productivity, physical and financial resources, worker performance and attitude, profitability, manager performance and development, and public responsibility.\n\nIn 1957, Philip Selznick initially used the term \"distinctive competence\" in referring to how the Navy was attempting to differentiate itself from the other services. He also formalized the idea of matching the organization's internal factors with external environmental circumstances. This core idea was developed further by Kenneth R. Andrews in 1963 into what we now call SWOT analysis, in which the strengths and weaknesses of the firm are assessed in light of the opportunities and threats in the business environment.\n\nAlfred Chandler recognized the importance of coordinating management activity under an all-encompassing strategy. Interactions between functions were typically handled by managers who relayed information back and forth between departments. Chandler stressed the importance of taking a long term perspective when looking to the future. In his 1962 ground breaking work \"Strategy and Structure\", Chandler showed that a long-term coordinated strategy was necessary to give a company structure, direction and focus. He says it concisely, \"structure follows strategy.\" Chandler wrote that: \"\"Strategy is the determination of the basic long-term goals of an enterprise, and the adoption of courses of action and the allocation of resources necessary for carrying out these goals\".\"\n\nIgor Ansoff built on Chandler's work by adding concepts and inventing a vocabulary. He developed a grid that compared strategies for market penetration, product development, market development and horizontal and vertical integration and diversification. He felt that management could use the grid to systematically prepare for the future. In his 1965 classic \"Corporate Strategy\", he developed gap analysis to clarify the gap between the current reality and the goals and to develop what he called \"gap reducing actions\". Ansoff wrote that strategic management had three parts: strategic planning; the skill of a firm in converting its plans into reality; and the skill of a firm in managing its own internal resistance to change.\n\nBruce Henderson, founder of the Boston Consulting Group, wrote about the concept of the experience curve in 1968, following initial work begun in 1965. The experience curve refers to a hypothesis that unit production costs decline by 20–30% every time cumulative production doubles. This supported the argument for achieving higher market share and economies of scale.\n\nPorter wrote in 1980 that companies have to make choices about their scope and the type of competitive advantage they seek to achieve, whether lower cost or differentiation. The idea of strategy targeting particular industries and customers (i.e., competitive positions) with a differentiated offering was a departure from the experience-curve influenced strategy paradigm, which was focused on larger scale and lower cost. Porter revised the strategy paradigm again in 1985, writing that superior performance of the processes and activities performed by organizations as part of their value chain is the foundation of competitive advantage, thereby outlining a process view of strategy.\n\nThe direction of strategic research also paralleled a major paradigm shift in how companies competed, specifically a shift from the production focus to market focus. The prevailing concept in strategy up to the 1950s was to create a product of high technical quality. If you created a product that worked well and was durable, it was assumed you would have no difficulty profiting. This was called the production orientation. Henry Ford famously said of the Model T car: \"Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants, so long as it is black.\"\n\nManagement theorist Peter F Drucker wrote in 1954 that it was the customer who defined what business the organization was in. In 1960 Theodore Levitt argued that instead of producing products then trying to sell them to the customer, businesses should start with the customer, find out what they wanted, and then produce it for them. The fallacy of the production orientation was also referred to as marketing myopia in an article of the same name by Levitt.\n\nOver time, the customer became the driving force behind all strategic business decisions. This marketing concept, in the decades since its introduction, has been reformulated and repackaged under names including market orientation, customer orientation, customer intimacy, customer focus, customer-driven and market focus.\n\nJim Collins wrote in 1997 that the strategic frame of reference is expanded by focusing on \"why\" a company exists rather than \"what\" it makes. In 2001, he recommended that organizations define themselves based on three key questions:\n\nIn 1985, Professor Ellen Earle-Chaffee summarized what she thought were the main elements of strategic management theory where consensus generally existed as of the 1970s, writing that strategic management:\n\nChaffee further wrote that research up to that point covered three models of strategy, which were not mutually exclusive: \n\nThe progress of strategy since 1960 can be charted by a variety of frameworks and concepts introduced by management consultants and academics. These reflect an increased focus on cost, competition and customers. These \"3 Cs\" were illuminated by much more robust empirical analysis at ever-more granular levels of detail, as industries and organizations were disaggregated into business units, activities, processes, and individuals in a search for sources of competitive advantage.\n\nBy the 1960s, the capstone business policy course at the Harvard Business School included the concept of matching the distinctive competence of a company (its internal strengths and weaknesses) with its environment (external opportunities and threats) in the context of its objectives. This framework came to be known by the acronym SWOT and was \"a major step forward in bringing explicitly competitive thinking to bear on questions of strategy\". Kenneth R. Andrews helped popularize the framework via a 1963 conference and it remains commonly used in practice.\n\nThe experience curve was developed by the Boston Consulting Group in 1966. It is a hypothesis that total per unit costs decline systematically by as much as 15–25% every time cumulative production (i.e., \"experience\") doubles. It has been empirically confirmed by some firms at various points in their history. Costs decline due to a variety of factors, such as the learning curve, substitution of labor for capital (automation), and technological sophistication. Author Walter Kiechel wrote that it reflected several insights, including:\nKiechel wrote in 2010: \"The experience curve was, simply, the most important concept in launching the strategy revolution...with the experience curve, the strategy revolution began to insinuate an acute awareness of competition into the corporate consciousness.\" Prior to the 1960s, the word competition rarely appeared in the most prominent management literature; U.S. companies then faced considerably less competition and did not focus on performance relative to peers. Further, the experience curve provided a basis for the retail sale of business ideas, helping drive the management consulting \nindustry.\n\nThe concept of the corporation as a portfolio of business units, with each plotted graphically based on its market share (a measure of its competitive position relative to its peers) and industry growth rate (a measure of industry attractiveness), was summarized in the growth–share matrix developed by the Boston Consulting Group around 1970. By 1979, one study estimated that 45% of the Fortune 500 companies were using some variation of the matrix in their strategic planning. This framework helped companies decide where to invest their resources (i.e., in their high market share, high growth businesses) and which businesses to divest (i.e., low market share, low growth businesses.) C. K. Prahalad and Gary Hamel suggested that companies should build portfolios of businesses around shared technical or operating competencies, and should develop structures and processes to enhance their core competencies.\n\nPorter wrote in 1987 that corporate strategy involves two questions: 1) What business should the corporation be in? and 2) How should the corporate office manage its business units? He mentioned four concepts of corporate strategy; the latter three can be used together:\n\nOther techniques were developed to analyze the relationships between elements in a portfolio. The growth-share matrix, a part of B.C.G. Analysis, was followed by G.E. multi factoral model, developed by General Electric. Companies continued to diversify as conglomerates until the 1980s, when deregulation and a less restrictive anti-trust environment led to the view that a portfolio of operating divisions in different industries was worth more as many independent companies, leading to the breakup of many conglomerates. While the popularity of portfolio theory has waxed and waned, the key dimensions considered (industry attractiveness and competitive position) remain central to strategy.\n\nIn 1980, Porter defined the two types of competitive advantage an organization can achieve relative to its rivals: lower cost or differentiation. This advantage derives from attribute(s) that allow an organization to outperform its competition, such as superior market position, skills, or resources. In Porter's view, strategic management should be concerned with building and sustaining competitive advantage.\n\nPorter developed a framework for analyzing the profitability of industries and how those profits are divided among the participants in 1980. In five forces analysis he identified the forces that shape the industry structure or environment. The framework involves the bargaining power of buyers and suppliers, the threat of new entrants, the availability of substitute products, and the competitive rivalry of firms in the industry. These forces affect the organization's ability to raise its prices as well as the costs of inputs (such as raw materials) for its processes.\n\nThe five forces framework helps describe how a firm can use these forces to obtain a sustainable competitive advantage, either lower cost or differentiation. Companies can maximize their profitability by competing in industries with favorable structure. Competitors can take steps to grow the overall profitability of the industry, or to take profit away from other parts of the industry structure. Porter modified Chandler's dictum about structure following strategy by introducing a second level of structure: while organizational structure follows strategy, it in turn follows industry structure.\n\nPorter wrote in 1980 that strategy target either cost leadership, differentiation, or focus. These are known as Porter's three generic strategies and can be applied to any size or form of business. Porter claimed that a company must only choose one of the three or risk that the business would waste precious resources. Porter's generic strategies detail the interaction between cost minimization strategies, product differentiation strategies, and market focus strategies.\n\nPorter described an industry as having multiple \"segments\" that can be targeted by a firm. The breadth of its targeting refers to the \"competitive scope\" of the business. Porter defined two types of \"competitive advantage\": lower cost or differentiation relative to its rivals. Achieving competitive advantage results from a firm's ability to cope with the five forces better than its rivals. Porter wrote: \"[A]chieving competitive advantage requires a firm to make a choice...about the type of competitive advantage it seeks to attain and the scope within which it will attain it.\" He also wrote: \"The two basic types of competitive advantage [differentiation and lower cost] combined with the scope of activities for which a firm seeks to achieve them lead to three \"generic strategies\" for achieving above average performance in an industry: cost leadership, differentiation and focus. The focus strategy has two variants, cost focus and differentiation focus.\"\n\nThe concept of choice was a different perspective on strategy, as the 1970s paradigm was the pursuit of market share (size and scale) influenced by the experience curve. Companies that pursued the highest market share position to achieve cost advantages fit under Porter's cost leadership generic strategy, but the concept of choice regarding differentiation and focus represented a new perspective.\n\nPorter's 1985 description of the value chain refers to the chain of activities (processes or collections of processes) that an organization performs in order to deliver a valuable product or service for the market. These include functions such as inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing and sales, and service, supported by systems and technology infrastructure. By aligning the various activities in its value chain with the organization's strategy in a coherent way, a firm can achieve a competitive advantage. Porter also wrote that strategy is an internally consistent configuration of activities that differentiates a firm from its rivals. A robust competitive position cumulates from many activities which should fit coherently together.\n\nPorter wrote in 1985: \"Competitive advantage cannot be understood by looking at a firm as a whole. It stems from the many discrete activities a firm performs in designing, producing, marketing, delivering and supporting its product. Each of these activities can contribute to a firm's relative cost position and create a basis for differentiation...the value chain disaggregates a firm into its strategically relevant activities in order to understand the behavior of costs and the existing and potential sources of differentiation.\"\n\nGary Hamel and C. K. Prahalad described the idea of core competency in 1990, the idea that each organization has some capability in which it excels and that the business should focus on opportunities in that area, letting others go or outsourcing them. Further, core competency is difficult to duplicate, as it involves the skills and coordination of people across a variety of functional areas or processes used to deliver value to customers. By outsourcing, companies expanded the concept of the value chain, with some elements within the entity and others without. Core competency is part of a branch of strategy called the \"resource-based view\" of the firm, which postulates that if activities are strategic as indicated by the value chain, then the organization's capabilities and ability to learn or adapt are also strategic.\n\nPeter Drucker wrote in 1994 about the \"Theory of the Business,\" which represents the key assumptions underlying a firm's strategy. These assumptions are in three categories: a) the external environment, including society, market, customer, and technology; b) the mission of the organization; and c) the core competencies needed to accomplish the mission. He continued that a valid theory of the business has four specifications: 1) assumptions about the environment, mission, and core competencies must fit reality; 2) the assumptions in all three areas have to fit one another; 3) the theory of the business must be known and understood throughout the organization; and 4) the theory of the business has to be tested constantly.\n\nHe wrote that organizations get into trouble when the assumptions representing the theory of the business no longer fit reality. He used an example of retail department stores, where their theory of the business assumed that people who could afford to shop in department stores would do so. However, many shoppers abandoned department stores in favor of specialty retailers (often located outside of malls) when time became the primary factor in the shopping destination rather than income.\n\nDrucker described the theory of the business as a \"hypothesis\" and a \"discipline.\" He advocated building in systematic diagnostics, monitoring and testing of the assumptions comprising the theory of the business to maintain competitiveness.\n\nStrategic thinking involves the generation and application of unique business insights to opportunities intended to create competitive advantage for a firm or organization. It involves challenging the assumptions underlying the organization's strategy and value proposition. Mintzberg wrote in 1994 that it is more about synthesis (i.e., \"connecting the dots\") than analysis (i.e., \"finding the dots\"). It is about \"capturing what the manager learns from all sources (both the soft insights from his or her personal experiences and the experiences of others throughout the organization and the hard data from market research and the like) and then synthesizing that learning into a vision of the direction that the business should pursue.\" Mintzberg argued that strategic thinking is the critical part of formulating strategy, more so than strategic planning exercises.\n\nGeneral Andre Beaufre wrote in 1963 that strategic thinking \"is a mental process, at once abstract and rational, which must be capable of synthesizing both psychological and material data. The strategist must have a great capacity for both analysis and synthesis; analysis is necessary to assemble the data on which he makes his diagnosis, synthesis in order to produce from these data the diagnosis itself--and the diagnosis in fact amounts to a choice between alternative courses of action.\"\n\nWill Mulcaster argued that while much research and creative thought has been devoted to generating alternative strategies, too little work has been done on what influences the quality of strategic decision making and the effectiveness with which strategies are implemented. For instance, in retrospect it can be seen that the financial crisis of 2008–9 could have been avoided if the banks had paid more attention to the risks associated with their investments, but how should banks change the way they make decisions to improve the quality of their decisions in the future? Mulcaster's Managing Forces framework addresses this issue by identifying 11 forces that should be incorporated into the processes of decision making and strategic implementation. The 11 forces are: Time; Opposing forces; Politics; Perception; Holistic effects; Adding value; Incentives; Learning capabilities; Opportunity cost; Risk and Style.\n\nStrategic planning is a means of administering the formulation and implementation of strategy. Strategic planning is analytical in nature and refers to formalized procedures to produce the data and analyses used as inputs for strategic thinking, which synthesizes the data resulting in the strategy. Strategic planning may also refer to control mechanisms used to implement the strategy once it is determined. In other words, strategic planning happens \"around\" the strategy formation process.\n\nPorter wrote in 1980 that formulation of competitive strategy includes consideration of four key elements:\nThe first two elements relate to factors internal to the company (i.e., the internal environment), while the latter two relate to factors external to the company (i.e., the external environment).\n\nThere are many analytical frameworks which attempt to organize the strategic planning process. Examples of frameworks that address the four elements described above include:\n\nA number of strategists use scenario planning techniques to deal with change. The way Peter Schwartz put it in 1991 is that strategic outcomes cannot be known in advance so the sources of competitive advantage cannot be predetermined. The fast changing business environment is too uncertain for us to find sustainable value in formulas of excellence or competitive advantage. Instead, scenario planning is a technique in which multiple outcomes can be developed, their implications assessed, and their likeliness of occurrence evaluated. According to Pierre Wack, scenario planning is about insight, complexity, and subtlety, not about formal analysis and numbers.\n\nSome business planners are starting to use a complexity theory approach to strategy. Complexity can be thought of as chaos with a dash of order. Chaos theory deals with turbulent systems that rapidly become disordered. Complexity is not quite so unpredictable. It involves multiple agents interacting in such a way that a glimpse of structure may appear.\n\nOnce the strategy is determined, various goals and measures may be established to chart a course for the organization, measure performance and control implementation of the strategy. Tools such as the balanced scorecard and strategy maps help crystallize the strategy, by relating key measures of success and performance to the strategy. These tools measure financial, marketing, production, organizational development, and innovation measures to achieve a 'balanced' perspective. Advances in information technology and data availability enable the gathering of more information about performance, allowing managers to take a much more analytical view of their business than before.\n\nStrategy may also be organized as a series of \"initiatives\" or \"programs\", each of which comprises one or more projects. Various monitoring and feedback mechanisms may also be established, such as regular meetings between divisional and corporate management to control implementation.\n\nA key component to strategic management which is often overlooked when planning is evaluation. There are many ways to evaluate whether or not strategic priorities and plans have been achieved, one such method is Robert Stake's Responsive Evaluation. Responsive evaluation provides a naturalistic and humanistic approach to program evaluation. In expanding beyond the goal-oriented or pre-ordinate evaluation design, responsive evaluation takes into consideration the program’s background (history), conditions, and transactions among stakeholders. It is largely emergent, the design unfolds as contact is made with stakeholders.\n\nWhile strategies are established to set direction, focus effort, define or clarify the organization, and provide consistency or guidance in response to the environment, these very elements also mean that certain signals are excluded from consideration or de-emphasized. Mintzberg wrote in 1987: \"Strategy is a categorizing scheme by which incoming stimuli can be ordered and dispatched.\" Since a strategy orients the organization in a particular manner or direction, that direction may not effectively match the environment, initially (if a bad strategy) or over time as circumstances change. As such, Mintzberg continued, \"Strategy [once established] is a force that resists change, not encourages it.\"\n\nTherefore, a critique of strategic management is that it can overly constrain managerial discretion in a dynamic environment. \"How can individuals, organizations and societies cope as well as possible with ... issues too complex to be fully understood, given the fact that actions initiated on the basis of inadequate understanding may lead to significant regret?\" Some theorists insist on an iterative approach, considering in turn objectives, implementation and resources. I.e., a \"...repetitive learning cycle [rather than] a linear progression towards a clearly defined final destination.\" Strategies must be able to adjust during implementation because \"humans rarely can proceed satisfactorily except by learning from experience; and modest probes, serially modified on the basis of feedback, usually are the best method for such learning.\"\n\nIn 2000, Gary Hamel coined the term strategic convergence to explain the limited scope of the strategies being used by rivals in greatly differing circumstances. He lamented that successful strategies are imitated by firms that do not understand that for a strategy to work, it must account for the specifics of each situation.\nWoodhouse and Collingridge claim that the essence of being “strategic” lies in a capacity for \"intelligent trial-and error\" rather than strict adherence to finely honed strategic plans. Strategy should be seen as laying out the general path rather than precise steps. Means are as likely to determine ends as ends are to determine means. The objectives that an organization might wish to pursue are limited by the range of feasible approaches to implementation. (There will usually be only a small number of approaches that will not only be technically and administratively possible, but also satisfactory to the full range of organizational stakeholders.) In turn, the range of feasible implementation approaches is determined by the availability of resources.\n\nVarious strategic approaches used across industries (themes) have arisen over the years. These include the shift from product-driven demand to customer- or marketing-driven demand (described above), the increased use of self-service approaches to lower cost, changes in the value chain or corporate structure due to globalization (e.g., off-shoring of production and assembly), and the internet.\n\nOne theme in strategic competition has been the trend towards self-service, often enabled by technology, where the customer takes on a role previously performed by a worker to lower the price. Examples include:\n\nOne definition of globalization refers to the integration of economies due to technology and supply chain process innovation. Companies are no longer required to be vertically integrated (i.e., designing, producing, assembling, and selling their products). In other words, the value chain for a company's product may no longer be entirely within one firm; several entities comprising a virtual firm may exist to fulfill the customer requirement. For example, some companies have chosen to outsource production to third parties, retaining only design and sales functions inside their organization.\n\nThe internet has dramatically empowered consumers and enabled buyers and sellers to come together with drastically reduced transaction and intermediary costs, creating much more robust marketplaces for the purchase and sale of goods and services. Examples include online auction sites, internet dating services, and internet book sellers. In many industries, the internet has dramatically altered the competitive landscape. Services that used to be provided within one entity (e.g., a car dealership providing financing and pricing information) are now provided by third parties. Further, compared to traditional media like television, the internet has caused a major shift in viewing habits through on demand content which has led to an increasingly fragmented audience.\n\nAuthor Phillip Evans said in 2013 that networks are challenging traditional hierarchies. Value chains may also be breaking up (\"deconstructing\") where information aspects can be separated from functional activity. Data that is readily available for free or very low cost makes it harder for information-based, vertically integrated businesses to remain intact. Evans said: \"The basic story here is that what used to be vertically integrated, oligopolistic competition among essentially similar kinds of competitors is evolving, by one means or another, from a vertical structure to a horizontal one. Why is that happening? It's happening because transaction costs are plummeting and because scale is polarizing. The plummeting of transaction costs weakens the glue that holds value chains together, and allows them to separate.\" He used Wikipedia as an example of a network that has challenged the traditional encyclopedia business model. Evans predicts the emergence of a new form of industrial organization called a \"stack\", analogous to a technology stack, in which competitors rely on a common platform of inputs (services or information), essentially layering the remaining competing parts of their value chains on top of this common platform.\n\nIn the recent decade, sustainability—or ability to successfully sustain a company in a context of rapidly changing environmental, social, health, and economic circumstances—has emerged as crucial aspect of any strategy development. Research focusing on corporations and leaders who have integrated sustainability into commercial strategy has led to emergence of the concept of \"embedded sustainability\" – defined by its authors Chris Laszlo and Nadya Zhexembayeva as \"incorporation of environmental, health, and social value into the core business with no trade-off in price or quality—in other words, with no social or green premium.\" Laszlo and Zhexembayeva's research showed that embedded sustainability offers at least seven distinct opportunities for business value and competitive advantage creation: a) better risk-management, b) increased efficiency through reduced waste and resource use, c) better product differentiation, d) new market entrances, e) enhanced brand and reputation, f) greater opportunity to influence industry standards, and g) greater opportunity for radical innovation. Nadya Zhexembayeva's 2014 research further suggested that innovation driven by resource depletion can result in fundamental competitive advantages for a company's products and services, as well as the company strategy as a whole, when right principles of innovation are applied.\n\nIn 1990, Peter Senge, who had collaborated with Arie de Geus at Dutch Shell, popularized de Geus' notion of the \"learning organization\". The theory is that gathering and analyzing information is a necessary requirement for business success in the information age. To do this, Senge claimed that an organization would need to be structured such that:\n\n\nSenge identified five disciplines of a learning organization. They are:\n\n\nGeoffrey Moore (1991) and R. Frank and P. Cook also detected a shift in the nature of competition. Markets driven by technical standards or by \"network effects\" can give the dominant firm a near-monopoly. The same is true of networked industries in which interoperability requires compatibility between users. Examples include Internet Explorer's and Amazon's early dominance of their respective industries. IE's later decline shows that such dominance may be only temporary.\n\nMoore showed how firms could attain this enviable position by using E.M. Rogers' five stage adoption process and focusing on one group of customers at a time, using each group as a base for reaching the next group. The most difficult step is making the transition between introduction and mass acceptance. (See Crossing the Chasm). If successful a firm can create a bandwagon effect in which the momentum builds and its product becomes a \"de facto\" standard.\n\nIn 1969, Peter Drucker coined the phrase Age of Discontinuity to describe the way change disrupts lives. In an age of continuity attempts to predict the future by extrapolating from the past can be accurate. But according to Drucker, we are now in an age of discontinuity and extrapolating is ineffective. He identifies four sources of discontinuity: new technologies, globalization, cultural pluralism and knowledge capital.\n\nIn 1970, Alvin Toffler in \"Future Shock\" described a trend towards accelerating rates of change. He illustrated how social and technical phenomena had shorter lifespans with each generation, and he questioned society's ability to cope with the resulting turmoil and accompanying anxiety. In past eras periods of change were always punctuated with times of stability. This allowed society to assimilate the change before the next change arrived. But these periods of stability had all but disappeared by the late 20th century. In 1980 in \"The Third Wave\", Toffler characterized this shift to relentless change as the defining feature of the third phase of civilization (the first two phases being the agricultural and industrial waves).\n\nIn 1978, Derek F. Abell (Abell, D. 1978) described \"strategic windows\" and stressed the importance of the timing (both entrance and exit) of any given strategy. This led some strategic planners to build planned obsolescence into their strategies.\n\nIn 1983, Noel Tichy wrote that because we are all beings of habit we tend to repeat what we are comfortable with. He wrote that this is a trap that constrains our creativity, prevents us from exploring new ideas, and hampers our dealing with the full complexity of new issues. He developed a systematic method of dealing with change that involved looking at any new issue from three angles: technical and production, political and resource allocation, and corporate culture.\n\nIn 1989, Charles Handy identified two types of change. \"Strategic drift\" is a gradual change that occurs so subtly that it is not noticed until it is too late. By contrast, \"transformational change\" is sudden and radical. It is typically caused by discontinuities (or exogenous shocks) in the business environment. The point where a new trend is initiated is called a \"strategic inflection point\" by Andy Grove. Inflection points can be subtle or radical.\n\nIn 1990, Richard Pascale wrote that relentless change requires that businesses continuously reinvent themselves. His famous maxim is “Nothing fails like success” by which he means that what was a strength yesterday becomes the root of weakness today, We tend to depend on what worked yesterday and refuse to let go of what worked so well for us in the past. Prevailing strategies become self-confirming. To avoid this trap, businesses must stimulate a spirit of inquiry and healthy debate. They must encourage a creative process of self-renewal based on constructive conflict.\n\nIn 1996, Adrian Slywotzky showed how changes in the business environment are reflected in value migrations between industries, between companies, and within companies. He claimed that recognizing the patterns behind these value migrations is necessary if we wish to understand the world of chaotic change. In “Profit Patterns” (1999) he described businesses as being in a state of strategic anticipation as they try to spot emerging patterns. Slywotsky and his team identified 30 patterns that have transformed industry after industry.\n\nIn 1997, Clayton Christensen (1997) took the position that great companies can fail precisely because they do everything right since the capabilities of the organization also define its disabilities. Christensen's thesis is that outstanding companies lose their market leadership when confronted with disruptive technology. He called the approach to discovering the emerging markets for disruptive technologies agnostic marketing, i.e., marketing under the implicit assumption that no one – not the company, not the customers – can know how or in what quantities a disruptive product can or will be used without the experience of using it.\n\nIn 1999, Constantinos Markides reexamined the nature of strategic planning. He described strategy formation and implementation as an ongoing, never-ending, integrated process requiring continuous reassessment and reformation. Strategic management is planned and emergent, dynamic and interactive.\n\nJ. Moncrieff (1999) stressed strategy dynamics. He claimed that strategy is partially deliberate and partially unplanned. The unplanned element comes from emergent strategies that result from the emergence of opportunities and threats in the environment and from \"strategies in action\" (ad hoc actions across the organization).\n\nDavid Teece pioneered research on resource-based strategic management and the dynamic capabilities perspective, defined as “the ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competencies to address rapidly changing environments\". His 1997 paper (with Gary Pisano and Amy Shuen) \"Dynamic Capabilities and Strategic Management\" was the most cited paper in economics and business for the period from 1995 to 2005.\n\nIn 2000, Gary Hamel discussed strategic decay, the notion that the value of every strategy, no matter how brilliant, decays over time.\n\nA large group of theorists felt the area where western business was most lacking was product quality. W. Edwards Deming, Joseph M. Juran, A. Kearney, Philip Crosby and Armand Feignbaum suggested quality improvement techniques such total quality management (TQM), continuous improvement (kaizen), lean manufacturing, Six Sigma, and return on quality (ROQ).\n\nContrarily, James Heskett (1988), Earl Sasser (1995), William Davidow, Len Schlesinger, A. Paraurgman (1988), Len Berry, Jane Kingman-Brundage, Christopher Hart, and Christopher Lovelock (1994), felt that poor customer service was the problem. They gave us fishbone diagramming, service charting, Total Customer Service (TCS), the service profit chain, service gaps analysis, the service encounter, strategic service vision, service mapping, and service teams. Their underlying assumption was that there is no better source of competitive advantage than a continuous stream of delighted customers.\n\nProcess management uses some of the techniques from product quality management and some of the techniques from customer service management. It looks at an activity as a sequential process. The objective is to find inefficiencies and make the process more effective. Although the procedures have a long history, dating back to Taylorism, the scope of their applicability has been greatly widened, leaving no aspect of the firm free from potential process improvements. Because of the broad applicability of process management techniques, they can be used as a basis for competitive advantage.\n\nCarl Sewell, Frederick F. Reichheld, C. Gronroos, and Earl Sasser observed that businesses were spending more on customer acquisition than on retention. They showed how a competitive advantage could be found in ensuring that customers returned again and again. Reicheld broadened the concept to include loyalty from employees, suppliers, distributors and shareholders. They developed techniques for estimating customer lifetime value (CLV) for assessing long-term relationships. The concepts begat attempts to recast selling and marketing into a long term endeavor that created a sustained relationship (called relationship selling, relationship marketing, and customer relationship management). Customer relationship management (CRM) software became integral to many firms.\n\nMichael Hammer and James Champy felt that these resources needed to be restructured. In a process that they labeled reengineering, firms reorganized their assets around whole processes rather than tasks. In this way a team of people saw a project through, from inception to completion. This avoided functional silos where isolated departments seldom talked to each other. It also eliminated waste due to functional overlap and interdepartmental communications.\n\nIn 1989 Richard Lester and the researchers at the MIT Industrial Performance Center identified seven best practices and concluded that firms must accelerate the shift away from the mass production of low cost standardized products. The seven areas of best practice were:\n\n\nThe search for best practices is also called benchmarking. This involves determining where you need to improve, finding an organization that is exceptional in this area, then studying the company and applying its best practices in your firm.\n\nProfessor Richard P. Rumelt described strategy as a type of problem solving in 2011. He wrote that good strategy has an underlying structure called a \"kernel\". The kernel has three parts: 1) A \"diagnosis\" that defines or explains the nature of the challenge; 2) A \"guiding policy\" for dealing with the challenge; and 3) Coherent \"actions\" designed to carry out the guiding policy.\nPresident Kennedy outlined these three elements of strategy in his Cuban Missile Crisis Address to the Nation of 22 October 1962: \n\nActive strategic management required active information gathering and active problem solving. In the early days of Hewlett-Packard (HP), Dave Packard and Bill Hewlett devised an active management style that they called \"management by walking around\" (MBWA). Senior HP managers were seldom at their desks. They spent most of their days visiting employees, customers, and suppliers. This direct contact with key people provided them with a solid grounding from which viable strategies could be crafted. Management consultants Tom Peters and Robert H. Waterman had used the term in their 1982 book \"\". Some Japanese managers employ a similar system, which originated at Honda, and is sometimes called the 3 G's (Genba, Genbutsu, and Genjitsu, which translate into \"actual place\", \"actual thing\", and \"actual situation\").\n\nIn 2010, IBM released a study summarizing three conclusions of 1500 CEOs around the world: 1) complexity is escalating, 2) enterprises are not equipped to cope with this complexity, and 3) creativity is now the single most important leadership competency. IBM said that it is needed in all aspects of leadership, including strategic thinking and planning.\n\nSimilarly, McKeown argued that over-reliance on any particular approach to strategy is dangerous and that multiple methods can be used to combine the creativity and analytics to create an \"approach to shaping the future\", that is difficult to copy.\n\nA 1938 treatise by Chester Barnard, based on his own experience as a business executive, described the process as informal, intuitive, non-routinized and involving primarily oral, 2-way communications. Bernard says \"The process is the sensing of the organization as a whole and the total situation relevant to it. It transcends the capacity of merely intellectual methods, and the techniques of discriminating the factors of the situation. The terms pertinent to it are \"feeling\", \"judgement\", \"sense\", \"proportion\", \"balance\", \"appropriateness\". It is a matter of art rather than science.\"\n\nIn 1973, Mintzberg found that senior managers typically deal with unpredictable situations so they strategize in \"ad hoc\", flexible, dynamic, and implicit ways. He wrote, \"The job breeds adaptive information-manipulators who prefer the live concrete situation. The manager works in an environment of stimulus-response, and he develops in his work a clear preference for live action.\"\n\nIn 1982, John Kotter studied the daily activities of 15 executives and concluded that they spent most of their time developing and working a network of relationships that provided general insights and specific details for strategic decisions. They tended to use \"mental road maps\" rather than systematic planning techniques.\n\nDaniel Isenberg's 1984 study of senior managers found that their decisions were highly intuitive. Executives often sensed what they were going to do before they could explain why. He claimed in 1986 that one of the reasons for this is the complexity of strategic decisions and the resultant information uncertainty.\n\nZuboff claimed that information technology was widening the divide between senior managers (who typically make strategic decisions) and operational level managers (who typically make routine decisions). She alleged that prior to the widespread use of computer systems, managers, even at the most senior level, engaged in both strategic decisions and routine administration, but as computers facilitated (She called it \"deskilled\") routine processes, these activities were moved further down the hierarchy, leaving senior management free for strategic decision making.\n\nIn 1977, Abraham Zaleznik distinguished leaders from managers. He described leaders as visionaries who inspire, while managers care about process. He claimed that the rise of managers was the main cause of the decline of American business in the 1970s and 1980s. Lack of leadership is most damaging at the level of strategic management where it can paralyze an entire organization.\n\nAccording to Corner, Kinichi, and Keats, strategic decision making in organizations occurs at two levels: individual and aggregate. They developed a model of parallel strategic decision making. The model identifies two parallel processes that involve getting attention, encoding information, storage and retrieval of information, strategic choice, strategic outcome and feedback. The individual and organizational processes interact at each stage. For instance, competition-oriented objectives are based on the knowledge of competing firms, such as their market share.\n\nThe 1980s also saw the widespread acceptance of positioning theory. Although the theory originated with Jack Trout in 1969, it didn’t gain wide acceptance until Al Ries and Jack Trout wrote their classic book \"Positioning: The Battle For Your Mind\" (1979). The basic premise is that a strategy should not be judged by internal company factors but by the way customers see it relative to the competition. Crafting and implementing a strategy involves creating a position in the mind of the collective consumer. Several techniques enabled the practical use of positioning theory. Perceptual mapping for example, creates visual displays of the relationships between positions. Multidimensional scaling, discriminant analysis, factor analysis and conjoint analysis are mathematical techniques used to determine the most relevant characteristics (called dimensions or factors) upon which positions should be based. Preference regression can be used to determine vectors of ideal positions and cluster analysis can identify clusters of positions.\n\nIn 1992 Jay Barney saw strategy as assembling the optimum mix of resources, including human, technology and suppliers, and then configuring them in unique and sustainable ways. \n\nJames Gilmore and Joseph Pine found competitive advantage in mass customization. Flexible manufacturing techniques allowed businesses to individualize products for each customer without losing economies of scale. This effectively turned the product into a service. They also realized that if a service is mass-customized by creating a \"performance\" for each individual client, that service would be transformed into an \"experience\". Their book, \"The Experience Economy\", along with the work of Bernd Schmitt convinced many to see service provision as a form of theatre. This school of thought is sometimes referred to as customer experience management (CEM).\n\nMany industries with a high information component are being transformed. For example, Encarta demolished Encyclopædia Britannica (whose sales have plummeted 80% since their peak of $650 million in 1990) before it was in turn, eclipsed by collaborative encyclopedias like Wikipedia. The music industry was similarly disrupted. The technology sector has provided some strategies directly. For example, from the software development industry agile software development provides a model for shared development processes.\n\nPeter Drucker conceived of the \"knowledge worker\" in the 1950s. He described how fewer workers would do physical labor, and more would apply their minds. In 1984, John Naisbitt theorized that the future would be driven largely by information: companies that managed information well could obtain an advantage, however the profitability of what he called \"information float\" (information that the company had and others desired) would disappear as inexpensive computers made information more accessible.\n\nDaniel Bell (1985) examined the sociological consequences of information technology, while Gloria Schuck and Shoshana Zuboff looked at psychological factors. Zuboff distinguished between \"automating technologies\" and \"informating technologies\". She studied the effect that both had on workers, managers and organizational structures. She largely confirmed Drucker's predictions about the importance of flexible decentralized structure, work teams, knowledge sharing and the knowledge worker's central role. Zuboff also detected a new basis for managerial authority, based on knowledge (also predicted by Drucker) which she called \"participative management\".\n\nMcKinsey & Company developed a capability maturity model in the 1970s to describe the sophistication of planning processes, with strategic management ranked the highest. The four stages include:\n\nThe long-term PIMS study, started in the 1960s and lasting for 19 years, attempted to understand the Profit Impact of Marketing Strategies (PIMS), particularly the effect of market share. The initial conclusion of the study was unambiguous: the greater a company's market share, the greater their rate of profit. Market share provides economies of scale. It also provides experience curve advantages. The combined effect is increased profits.\n\nThe benefits of high market share naturally led to an interest in growth strategies. The relative advantages of horizontal integration, vertical integration, diversification, franchises, mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and organic growth were discussed. Other research indicated that a low market share strategy could still be very profitable. Schumacher (1973), Woo and Cooper (1982), Levenson (1984), and later Traverso (2002) showed how smaller niche players obtained very high returns.\n\nIn the 1980s business strategists realized that there was a vast knowledge base stretching back thousands of years that they had barely examined. They turned to military strategy for guidance. Military strategy books such as \"The Art of War\" by Sun Tzu, \"On War\" by von Clausewitz, and \"The Red Book\" by Mao Zedong became business classics. From Sun Tzu, they learned the tactical side of military strategy and specific tactical prescriptions. From von Clausewitz, they learned the dynamic and unpredictable nature of military action. From Mao, they learned the principles of guerrilla warfare. Important marketing warfare books include \"Business War Games\" by Barrie James, \"Marketing Warfare\" by Al Ries and Jack Trout and \"Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun\" by Wess Roberts.\n\nThe four types of business warfare theories are:\n\nThe marketing warfare literature also examined leadership and motivation, intelligence gathering, types of marketing weapons, logistics and communications.\n\nBy the twenty-first century marketing warfare strategies had gone out of favour in favor of non-confrontational approaches. In 1989, Dudley Lynch and Paul L. Kordis published \"Strategy of the Dolphin: Scoring a Win in a Chaotic World\". \"The Strategy of the Dolphin\" was developed to give guidance as to when to use aggressive strategies and when to use passive strategies. A variety of aggressiveness strategies were developed.\n\nIn 1993, J. Moore used a similar metaphor. Instead of using military terms, he created an ecological theory of predators and prey(see ecological model of competition), a sort of Darwinian management strategy in which market interactions mimic long term ecological stability.\n\nAuthor Phillip Evans said in 2014 that \"Henderson's central idea was what you might call the Napoleonic idea of concentrating mass against weakness, of overwhelming the enemy. What Henderson recognized was that, in the business world, there are many phenomena which are characterized by what economists would call increasing returns—scale, experience. The more you do of something, disproportionately the better you get. And therefore he found a logic for investing in such kinds of overwhelming mass in order to achieve competitive advantage. And that was the first introduction of essentially a military concept of strategy into the business world. ... It was on those two ideas, Henderson's idea of increasing returns to scale and experience, and Porter's idea of the value chain, encompassing heterogenous elements, that the whole edifice of business strategy was subsequently erected.\"\n\nLike Peters and Waterman a decade earlier, James Collins and Jerry Porras spent years conducting empirical research on what makes great companies. Six years of research uncovered a key underlying principle behind the 19 successful companies that they studied: They all encourage and preserve a core ideology that nurtures the company. Even though strategy and tactics change daily, the companies, nevertheless, were able to maintain a core set of values. These core values encourage employees to build an organization that lasts. In \"Built To Last\" (1994) they claim that short term profit goals, cost cutting, and restructuring will not stimulate dedicated employees to build a great company that will endure. In 2000 Collins coined the term \"built to flip\" to describe the prevailing business attitudes in Silicon Valley. It describes a business culture where technological change inhibits a long term focus. He also popularized the concept of the BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal).\n\nArie de Geus (1997) undertook a similar study and obtained similar results. He identified four key traits of companies that had prospered for 50 years or more. They are:\n\nA company with these key characteristics he called a \"living company\" because it is able to perpetuate itself. If a company emphasizes knowledge rather than finance, and sees itself as an ongoing community of human beings, it has the potential to become great and endure for decades. Such an organization is an organic entity capable of learning (he called it a \"learning organization\") and capable of creating its own processes, goals, and persona.\n\nWill Mulcaster suggests that firms engage in a dialogue that centres around these questions:\n\n\n\n"}

Capital One has been aggressive about testing since the firm was founded, testing everything from product design to marketing to customer selection to collection policies. In a single year, the company performs tens of thousands of tests, allowing it to offer thousands of different types of credit cards to customers, based on the knowledge gained from their tests. Richard Fairbank, CEO of Capital One, called test and learn \"a marketing revolution that can be applied to many businesses\".\n\n\n\nThere are a variety of software tools available today to support systematic testing within an organization. However, there is currently no one software package that covers all types of tests, and in some cases significant knowledge of statistics is still required for effective analysis.\n\nMany companies, including Capital One and eBay, have developed experiment management software within the company. Alternatives to internal solutions include broad statistical analysis software tools such as SAS or test and learn focused software from Applied Predictive Technologies or MarketDial. There are also a variety of more narrowly tailored products, focused on particular problems or fields. In web analytics, for example, firms such as Omniture, WebTrends, and Google have created specialized software.\n\nCompanies wanting to conduct Test and Learn must mobilize, track and analyze site and customer data at very granular levels. This can often be a massive and expensive undertaking. Increasingly however, an exponential increase in computing power, and corresponding decrease in its cost, have made testing more accessible. In the Harvard Business Review February 2009 article \"How to Design Smart Business Experiments\", Thomas Davenport discusses the Test and Learn Process, and describes how several companies have overcome these and other barriers to testing.\n\n"}

The vulnerability period is a period prescribed by statute immediately preceding the company going into liquidation. Most jurisdictions provide for alternative vulnerability periods: a longer one for parties who are \"connected\" to the company, and a shorter one for unrelated third parties.\n\nThe effect of laws relating to voidable floating charges varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Some countries simply provide that such charge are automatically void or not enforceable, In other jurisdictions, they are only voidable and an application must be made by a liquidator or creditor for the floating charge to be set aside.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, a floating charge is only vulnerable to the extent that it does not secure new money for the company. So if a bank has a loan of £100 outstanding to a company, and it advances a further £50 but takes an \"all-monies\" floating charge as security, and the company goes into liquidation 3 months later, the floating charge will validly secure the £50 advance which was made at the time, but not the earlier £100. Legislation relating to voidable floating charges is intended to prevent abuse of a security interest which catches literally all of the assets of the company, and could be used by person to strip out all of the assets from a company in difficulty from the unsecured creditors. However, if the holder of the floating charge has inserted new money, then giving the holder a valid security up to the amount of the new money injected does not prejudice the position of the unsecured creditors.\n\nMost legislation relating to voidable floating charges is also expressed to apply to charges which, as created, were floating charges but which subsequently crystallised into fixed charges.\n"}

He was the younger son of Tim Mara, who founded the Giants in 1925. Wellington was a ball boy for that year.\n\nMara was born in Rochester, New York, the son of Elizabeth \"Lizette\" (née Barclay), a homemaker, and Timothy James Mara. He was of Irish descent. Mara was an alumnus of Loyola School and Fordham University, both New York City Jesuit schools.\n\nIn 1930, Timothy James Mara split his ownership interests between Wellington (then 14) and his older brother Jack. Soon after graduating from Fordham University, Wellington moved into the Giants' front office as team treasurer and assistant to his father. He became the team's secretary in 1940. After fighting in World War II, he returned to the Giants as team vice president, a post he retained after his father died in 1958. When Jack, who had been president since 1941, died in 1965, Wellington became team president. \n\nFor his first 37 years in the organization, he handled the franchise's football decisions. However, his growing involvement in league affairs led him to turn over most of his day-to-day responsibilities to operations director Andy Robustelli in 1974. He didn't relinquish full control over the football side of the operation until 1979, when George Young became the team's first general manager.\n\nThe Giants were hamstrung for several years by a strained relationship between Wellington and his nephew, Tim J. Mara, who inherited Jack's stake in the team upon Jack's death. By the 1970s, they almost never spoke to each other, and a partition had to be built in the owners' box. The Maras continued to retain close control over the Giants' day-to-day operations long after most other owners had delegated such authority. Only the fallout from the 1978 Fumble, in which a certain Giant win turned into a loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on a last-second fumble, convinced the Maras of the need to modernize--among other things, by hiring Young and giving him full control over football operations.\n\nUnder Mara's direction the New York Football Giants won six NFL titles (including two Super Bowl wins), nine conference championships (including six Eastern Conference championships in the days before the NFL-AFL merger and three NFC championships post-merger), and 13 division championships. An eighth NFL title, third and fourth Super Bowl victories, fifth NFC championship (11th conference championship overall), and 15th division title have been captured since his passing under the leadership of his son, John, and co-owner Steve Tisch (who in turn is the son of Wellington's former co-owner from 1991–2005, Bob Tisch; Tisch also died in 2005, with his death coming three weeks after Mara's).\n\nThe Giants have also accumulated the third highest number of victories in National Football League history. Mara was also well liked by the Giants' players, and was known to stick by them even when they struggled with off-the-field problems. When Lawrence Taylor was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1999 he credited Mara for supporting him even during the worst times of his drug addiction saying, \"He probably cared more about me as a person than he really should have.\" Taylor has since lived a clean life style and credits Mara with helping him fight his addiction.\n\nNot long after Mara came to work with the team, the players--many of whom were barely older than him--nicknamed him \"Duke\" because they knew he was named after the Duke of Wellington, whom his father called \"the fightingest of all Irishmen.\" The nickname stuck. The Wilson football used in NFL games prior to the AFL merger (1941–69) was nicknamed \"THE DUKE\" after Mara. For the 2006 season and beyond, a new version of \"THE DUKE\" has been used in NFL games.\n\nHe was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1997. Mara was married to Ann Mara. His granddaughters include actresses Kate Mara and Rooney Mara.\n\nIn 2012, Mara was elected into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.\n\nWellington Mara succumbed to lymphoma in 2005 at age 89. He was interred at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, New York, after his funeral at New York's Saint Patrick's Cathedral. He was survived by his wife Ann Mara (1929-2015), 11 children, and 42 grandchildren. His team honored him after his death by defeating the Washington Redskins, the team he always viewed as the Giants' biggest (and oldest) rival, 36–0 on Oct. 30, 2005 at Giants Stadium. The 80,000 fans in attendance gave his mention a standing ovation.\n\n\n"}

He served as the 18th Governor of Florida after being a lawyer, county judge, and state representative.\n\nHe was born near Walnut Hill, Illinois, and attended public schools in Marion County. Jennings graduated from Southern Illinois University in 1883, then studied law at the Union College of Law in Chicago (now named Northwestern University School of Law). He finished his law studies in Chicago under the supervision of his brother, Charles E. Jennings, who was the State Attorney for Marion County.\n\nHe came to Florida in 1885 and settled in Brooksville, Florida. In 1887, he was appointed circuit court commissioner, and became county judge of Hernando County, Florida in 1888.\nJennings resigned his office as county judge in 1893 to serve in the Florida House of Representatives, eventually becoming Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives in 1895.\nAfter his term ended, he served as a Colonel in the Florida militia, was president of the Brooksville town council and chairman of the Democratic committee.\nJennings campaigned for and was elected governor in 1900, taking the oath of office on January 8, 1901. During his term in office, he introduced the statewide primary election system, replacing the previous method of nominating candidates for political office at a convention. The first statewide primary election was conducted in 1902. It was also Jennings idea to drain and develop the Everglades by cutting the natural rock dams in the rivers of south Florida. His term ended on January 3, 1905.\n\nHe moved to Jacksonville, then Florida’s largest city, where he established a successful law practice. He divided his time between a home in Jacksonville and a farm and timber holdings in Clay County near Middleburg.\n\nIn 1905, he was appointed by Governor Napoleon B. Broward as General Counsel for the Internal Improvement Fund, the state agency responsible for administering public lands. The new governor also favored the development of the Everglades, so in this position, which Jennings held until 1909, he was able to continue leading drainage activities in the Everglades.\n\nJennings met May Mann at her father’s home near Brooksville, and began a courtship. May's father, Austin Mann, had been a Florida Senator and had just won election to the state house of representatives. When the legislative session began in January, 1891, May went to Tallahassee to serve as her father's aide, with responsibility for her father's appointments, correspondence and hosting social events.\nJennings went to Tallahassee to continue his courtship. He married May Mann on May 12, 1891 and they were escorted down the aisle by the full legislative membership. The newlyweds lived in Brooksville in the William Sherman Jennings House. The couple had one child, a son, Sherman Bryan Jennings.\n\nPolitics and the law were prominent in his family. In addition to his brother, who was a lawyer and state attorney, he was a first cousin to William Jennings Bryan, congressman and three-time Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nJennings served as a Trustee of Stetson University during the first decade of the twentieth century and was involved in the controversy over whether the Florida Baptist Convention would elect the trustees of the university. At one point, the controversy became so heated that Jennings and Lincoln Hulley, the President of the University, engaged in a fistfight in the lobby of the Leon Hotel in Tallahassee, Florida.\n\nJennings died on February 27, 1920 in St. Augustine, Florida and was buried in Jacksonville, Florida.\n\n"}
