White\n\nAlasdair Antony Kenneth White (born May 24, 1952) is a British management theorist best known for his work on performance management from a behavioural perspective and in the field of deconcentrated and networked organizations. Along with John Fairhurst, White developed the White-Fairhurst Performance Hypothesis relating to the performance life-cycle. He is also the author of \"Continuous Quality Improvement\" and \"The Essential Guide to Developing Your Staff\".\n\nIn 2006, he worked closely with John Fairhurst and, following various observational studies, they formulated the White-Fairhurst Performance Hypothesis which states that \"all performance will initially trend towards a steady state, particularly after a period of performance uplift, and that steady state will then develop a downward curve leading to a significant performance decline\".\nIn a paper entitled \"From Comfort Zone to Performance Management\", White examines the hypothesis from a theoretical perspective starting with the Comfort Zone Theory and the work of Robert Yerkes and John Dodson, David McClelland et al., the Tuckman Model and Colin Carnall. This theoretical examination leads White to conclude that the White-Fairhurst Hypothesis broadly holds true and the performance curve is as demonstrated in the White-Fairhurst TPR Life-cycle Model (TPR stands for Transforming, Performing, Reforming). There has been some criticism of White’s approach, suggesting that more recent sources and work would have been more appropriate, but none have been able to offer a counter-argument or to adequately refute or dispute the hypothesis. The fact remains that most of the fundamentals of performance behaviour were established in the last century and that the more recent work is itself based on this earlier work.\n\nWhite argues that what is important now is to determine trend-change points on the performance curve so that the most appropriate performance management actions can be applied. He conducted research within a university environment in this relation to this and the result is recorded in his 2008 essay \"Managing Academic Performance\" the underlying theory of which underpins the approach being adopted by a number of academic institutions.\n\nIn addition to writing on management issues, White is also active in writing and editing fiction for White & MacLean Publishing. Among those writings include the a political and action novel \"Shadows\", written under the pen-name of Alex Hunter.\n\n\n\n"}

It generates available quantities of the requested product, and delivery due dates. Therefore, ATP supports order promising and fulfillment, aiming to manage demand and match it to production plans.\n\nAvailable-to-promise functions are IT-enabled and usually integrated in enterprise management software packages. However, ATP execution may need to be adjusted for the way a certain company operates.\n\nA fundamental distinction between ATP functions is based on the push-pull strategy. Push-based ATP is based on forecasts regarding future demand - based on anticipation of demand, ATP quantities and availability dates are computed. A prominent example is the traditional determination of ATP based on the Master Production Schedule. The push-based approach is fundamentally limited by dependence on forecasts, which may prove inaccurate. Gross ATP represents the total available supply, and net ATP represents the supply remaining to support new demands, after existing commitments to customers have been accounted for.\n\nPull-based models, on the other hand, dynamically allocate resources in response to actual customer orders. This means that pull-based ATP is able to balance forecast-driven resource replenishment with order-triggered resource utilization, but because resources are allocated with each coming order, the process will yield myopic results.\n\nATP functions can be executed in real time, driven by each individual order, or in batch mode – meaning that at a certain time interval, the system checks availability for orders piled up in that period of time. The process is triggered by the need to check resource availability before making a commitment to deliver an order. For example, ATP calculation using SAP software depends on the level of \"stock, planned receipts (production orders, purchase orders, planned orders and so on), and planned requirements (sales orders, deliveries, reservations, etc.)\"\n\n"}

The 45-story building is now a residential tower named \"The Downtown Club\" which opened in 2005.\n\nThe clubhouse within the building was not physically damaged in the attack on September 11, 2001, but it was located within the \"frozen zone\" from which the public was excluded for an extended period during the clean-up after the attack. The club's finances could not withstand the financial impact of such a long closure. The members, as well as the managers and employees, some who had been with the club for over 20 years, were devastated at the loss of the club and the employees' livelihood.\n\nThe Downtown Club building is registered as a New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission landmark site. It is currently home to condos and a preschool academy.\n\nIt was most famous for its annual awarding of the Heisman Trophy in its building, given every year to the most outstanding college football player, and named after John Heisman, the club's first athletic director. The Heisman Trophy was relocated temporarily uptown to the Yale Club of New York City. The ceremony moved to the Hilton New York for 2004 and has been presented annually at the PlayStation Theater since 2005.\n"}

It combines the strength of both business processes and production operations processes. It is the deliberate act of synchronizing business strategy with operational execution in real-time to enable closed loop business control across an enterprise.\n\n\nInteroperating enterprise and industrial service-oriented architectures (SOA) provide industrial companies with the potential for problem solutions that cover entire plants and entire industrial enterprises. This enterprise-wide system can be developed using systems and technologies previously installed. The resulting system, consisting of multiple vendor products acquired over many years working as a single system, is what is referred to as an enterprise control system.\nThe enterprise control strategy is built around the premise that manufacturing needs an enterprise control system to integrate business systems and manufacturing in real-time. The concept of the enterprise control system encompasses everything from sensors and people in manufacturing to the ERP system.\n\nAn enterprise control system is the open architecture framework to integrate control systems with the enterprise while adding functions to improve business performance including MES, optimization, workflow, quality management, and asset management.\n\nA distributed control system gave way to process automation systems which lead the way for the concept of collaborative automation process systems developed by ARC Advisory Group\n\nLater, enterprise control systems became key terminology in the marketplace.\n\nANSI/ISA-95, or ISA-95 as it is more commonly referred, is an international standard for developing an automated interface between enterprise and control systems. This standard has been developed for global manufacturers. It was developed to be applied in all industries, and in all sorts of processes, like batch processes, continuous and repetitive processes.\n\nPurdue Reference Model, “95” provides a model that end users, integrators and vendors can share in integrating applications at key layers in the enterprise.\n\n\n"}

Previously, only the common law provided protection to cargo-owners; but the Hague Rules should not be seen as a \"consumers' charter\" for shippers because the 1924 Convention actually favoured carriers and reduced their obligations to shippers.\n\nThe Hague Rules represented the first attempt by the international community to find a workable and uniform way to address the problem of shipowners regularly excluding themselves from all liability for loss or damage to cargo. The objective of the Hague Rules was to establish a minimum mandatory liability of carriers.\n\nUnder the Hague Rules the shipper bears the cost of lost/damaged goods if they cannot prove that the vessel was unseaworthy, improperly manned or unable to safely transport and preserve the cargo, i.e. the carrier can avoid liability for risks resulting from human errors provided they exercise due diligence and their vessel is properly manned and seaworthy. These provisions have frequently been the subject of discussion between shipowners and cargo interests on whether they provide an appropriate balance in liability.\n\nThe Hague Rules form the basis of national legislation in almost all of the world's major trading nations, and cover nearly all the present international shipping. The Hague Rules have been updated by two protocols, but neither addressed the basic liability provisions, which remain unchanged.\n\nThe Hague Rules were slightly amended (beginning in 1931, and further in 1977 and 1982) to become the Hague-Visby Rules. In addition, the U.N. established a fairer and more modern set of rules, the Hamburg Rules (effective 1992). Also a more radical and extensive set of rules is the Rotterdam Rules, but as of November 2015, only 3 states have ratified these rules, so they are not yet in force.\n"}

The OECD is a primary supplier of research and data pertaining to parental-leave rights.\n\nPaid maternity leave is important for women to take time away from work to bond with a child without financial pressures. Of the 193 United Nations countries, only a handful do not have a paid-parental-leave policy: New Guinea, Suriname, the United States and a few South Pacific island nations. The international history dates back to the 1970s, with countries such as Iraq granting full pay for women. By the 1980s, Great Britain was at the point of giving women benefits but did not specify a pay rate. The history of pay rates is limited and not well-recorded, except by the OECD.\n\nMaternity leave varies by country, with most developed countries having at least one set type of maternity leave. Most maternity leaves include a length of time to take off, with some form of pay. The following countries grouped by pay rate.\n\nIn the United Kingdom maternity-leave pay is known as Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP), which can cover up to 39 weeks of maternity leave. A woman can expect to earn 90 percent of her weekly earnings for the first six weeks of maternity leave; after that, the rate decreases.\n\nIn Australia, women can receive up to 18 weeks minimum-wage from the government; if an employer offers paid leave, a mother can receive that as well. In Canada, a woman can receive 17 weeks of maternity leave: two weeks before giving birth and 15 weeks afterwards. The two weeks before birth are unpaid. In New Zealand, primary leave is 18 weeks of paid leave; special leave covers 10 days (spread out) for appointments or unpaid illness.\n\nIn Denmark, a woman can receive 35 or 46 weeks of paid leave; the 35-week pay leave may be spread over 46 weeks. Women in Greece must be insured to receive maternity benefits, which include 56 days before giving birth and 63 days afterwards. To receive the benefits a woman must stop working for 56 days. If she does not take 56 days off, the woman must add the days after giving birth to be paid. In Switzerland, a woman is guaranteed up to 14 weeks (a minimum of 8 weeks) of paid leave after giving birth. She is paid 80 percent of her previous wage, with a daily maximum.\n\nIcelandic women receive 13 weeks of paid maternity leave (with an additional shared 13 weeks), with a ceiling of ISK370,000 per month. Japan allows 14 weeks if the woman is enrolled in the Employees' Health Insurance system. The leave can be taken by both parents in one absence period. There is a minimum payment of ¥46,230 per month and a maximum monthly payment of ¥285,420. Sixteen weeks of maternity leave are on the condition that the employee was employed for 236 weeks by the 15th week before the first week of leave. There is no ceiling on payments for the first six weeks. Slovakia grants leave until the child's third birthday as a family entitlement, with a monthly benefit of €203.2.\n\nWomen in Cyprus, including women who are adopting, receive 16 weeks of maternity leave. Nine weeks are mandatory, with the first two beginning two weeks before the expected due date. During this time, women receive a grant which serves as maternity pay. After maternity leave, women can apply to leave work an hour each day with pay for six months to help care for their child. In the Czech Republic, women receive 28 weeks of paid maternity leave; the minimum leave is 14 weeks. Families can receive financial support for child care. Women in Hungary have the options of up to 24 weeks of maternity leave at 70-percent pay or financial support and job insurance to raise the child, with part-time work promoted. In Korea, a woman receives 44 days of maternity leave before the birth and 90 days afterwards. During the first 60 days of the 90-day period, they receive full salary; during the last 30 days, they can receive up to ₩1,350,000. Swedish parents receive 480 days of maternity leave, with 90 days reserved for the father. The first 300 days are at 80-percent of pay, and the remainder is paid at a flat rate.\n\nIn Italy, women receive 80 percent of their normal earnings for six months. Latvian women are granted 114 days of paid leave, which may be extended based on health complications, the birth of more than one child or if there is more than one child under age two. When they return to work, mothers are allowed time to check on their child (or children). Maltese women receive 18 weeks of uninterrupted maternity leave. The first 14 weeks are full salary and benefits, and the last four weeks can be covered by the government. In Romania, women have two options: a one-year leave at 75-percent salary, with a bonus when they return to work, or two years at 75 percent without the return bonus.\n\nIn Bulgaria women receive 410 days of maternity leave at 90-percent salary, with 45 days granted before giving birth. French women are given 16 weeks of paid maternity leave for their first child, and time off increases with subsequent children. The amount paid is based on household income and how many children are already in the family. In Norway, women can choose 49 weeks at 100 percent of salary or 59 weeks at 80 percent.\n\nAccording to OECD research, 60 percent of countries offering maternity leave do not provide full pay. The table lists countries offering less than full salary, from lowest to highest.\n\nThese pay rates are the average of the paid leave for an individual earning 100 percent of the 2014 national average. In most countries, leave payments are calculated on gross earnings; however, in some—e.g., Austria, Chile, France and Germany—payments are based on net earnings (after income-tax and social-security payments). Pay rates in these countries reflect the proportion of net earnings replaced by the relevant payments, and should not be compared directly with pay rates based on gross earnings. Many countries have a variable rate; for example, Belgium gives women 82% of their salary for the first month. For the remaining three or four months (depending on the number of births) they receive 75 percent, with a cap of €133 per day.\n\nMost OECD countries provide payments replacing over 50 percent of previous earnings, with twelve countries offering average-wage mothers full compensation for the leave. Pay rates are lowest in Ireland and the United Kingdom, where only about one-third of gross average earnings are replaced by maternity benefits. Despite lengthy paid-leave entitlements, full-rate maternity leave in these countries is only nine weeks in Ireland and twelve in the UK.\n"}

{"id": "1674621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1674621", "title": "Process modeling", "text": "Process modeling\n\nThe term process model is used in various contexts. For example, in business process modeling the enterprise process model is often referred to as the \"business process model\".\n\nProcess models are processes of the same nature that are classified together into a model. Thus, a process model is a description of a process at the type level. Since the process model is at the type level, a process is an instantiation of it. The same process model is used repeatedly for the development of many applications and thus, has many instantiations. One possible use of a process model is to prescribe how things must/should/could be done in contrast to the process itself which is really what happens. A process model is roughly an anticipation of what the process will look like. What the process shall be will be determined during actual system development.\n\nThe goals of a process model are to be:\n\nFrom a theoretical point of view, the meta-process modeling explains the key concepts needed to describe what happens in the development process, on what, when it happens, and why. From an operational point of view, the meta-process modeling is aimed at providing guidance for method engineers and application developers.\n\nThe activity of modeling a business process usually predicates a need to change processes or identify issues to be corrected. This transformation may or may not require IT involvement, although that is a common driver for the need to model a business process. Change management programmes are desired to put the processes into practice. With advances in technology from larger platform vendors, the vision of business process models (BPM) becoming fully executable (and capable of round-trip engineering) is coming closer to reality every day. Supporting technologies include Unified Modeling Language (UML), model-driven architecture, and service-oriented architecture.\n\nProcess modeling addresses the process aspects of an enterprise business architecture, leading to an all encompassing enterprise architecture. The relationships of a business processes in the context of the rest of the enterprise systems, data, organizational structure, strategies, etc. create greater capabilities in analyzing and planning a change. One real-world example is in corporate mergers and acquisitions; understanding the processes in both companies in detail, allowing management to identify redundancies resulting in a smoother merger.\n\nProcess modeling has always been a key aspect of business process reengineering, and continuous improvement approaches seen in Six Sigma.\n\nThere are five types of coverage where the term process model has been defined differently:\n\nProcesses can be of different kinds. These definitions \"correspond to the various ways in which a process can be modelled\".\n\n\nGranularity refers to the level of detail of a process model and affects the kind of guidance, explanation and trace that can be provided. Coarse granularity restricts these to a rather limited level of detail whereas fine granularity provides more detailed capability. The nature of granularity needed is dependent on the situation at hand.\n\nProject manager, customer representatives, the general, top-level, or middle management require rather coarse-grained process description as they want to gain an overview of time, budget, and resource planning for their decisions. In contrast, software engineers, users, testers, analysts, or software system architects will prefer a fine-grained process model where the details of the model can provide them with instructions and important execution dependencies such as the dependencies between people.\n\nWhile notations for fine-grained models exist, most traditional process models are coarse-grained descriptions. Process models should, ideally, provide a wide range of granularity (e.g. Process Weaver).\n\nIt was found that while process models were prescriptive, in actual practice departures from the prescription can occur. Thus, frameworks for adopting methods evolved so that systems development methods match specific organizational situations and thereby improve their usefulness. The development of such frameworks is also called situational method engineering.\n\nMethod construction approaches can be organized in a flexibility spectrum ranging from 'low' to 'high'.\n\nLying at the 'low' end of this spectrum are rigid methods, whereas at the 'high' end there are modular method construction. Rigid methods are completely pre-defined and leave little scope for adapting them to the situation at hand. On the other hand, modular methods can be modified and augmented to fit a given situation. Selecting a rigid methods allows each project to choose its method from a panel of rigid, pre-defined methods, whereas selecting a path within a method consists of choosing the appropriate path for the situation at hand. Finally, selecting and tuning a method allows each project to select methods from different approaches and tune them to the project's needs.\" \n\nAs the quality of process models is being discussed in this paper, there is a need to elaborate quality of modeling techniques as an important essence in quality of process models. In most existing frameworks created for understanding the quality, the line between quality of modeling techniques and the quality of models as a result of the application of those techniques are not clearly drawn. This report will concentrate both on quality of process modeling techniques and quality of process models to clearly differentiate the two.\nVarious frameworks were developed to help in understanding quality of process modeling techniques, one example is Quality based modeling evaluation framework or known as Q-Me framework which argued to provide set of well defined quality properties and procedures to make an objective assessment of this properties possible.\nThis framework also has advantages of providing uniform and formal description of the model element within one or different model types using one modeling techniques\nIn short this can make assessment of both the product quality and the process quality of modeling techniques with regard to a set of properties that have been defined before.\n\nQuality properties that relate to business process modeling techniques discussed in are:\n\n\nTo assess the quality of Q-ME framework; it is used to illustrate the quality of the dynamic essentials modeling of the organisation (DEMO) business modeling techniques.\n\nIt is stated that the evaluation of the Q-ME framework to the DEMO modeling techniques has revealed the shortcomings of Q-ME. One particular is that it does not include quantifiable metric to express the quality of business modeling technique which makes it hard to compare quality of different techniques in an overall rating.\n\nThere is also a systematic approach for quality measurement of modeling techniques known as complexity metrics suggested by Rossi et al. (1996). Techniques of Meta model is used as a basis for computation of these complexity metrics. In comparison to quality framework proposed by Krogstie, quality measurement focus more on technical level instead of individual model level.\n\nAuthors (Cardoso, Mendling, Neuman and Reijers, 2006) used complexity metrics to measure the simplicity and understandability of a design. This is supported by later research done by Mendling \"et al.\" who argued that without using the quality metrics to help question quality properties of a model, simple process can be modeled in a complex and unsuitable way. This in turn can lead to a lower understandability, higher maintenance cost and perhaps inefficient execution of the process in question.\n\nThe quality of modeling technique is important in creating models that are of quality and contribute to the correctness and usefulness of models.\n\nEarliest process models reflected the dynamics of the process with a practical process obtained by instantiation in terms of relevant concepts, available technologies, specific implementation environments, process constraints and so on.\n\nEnormous number of research has been done on quality of models but less focus has been shifted towards the quality of process models. Quality issues of process models cannot be evaluated exhaustively however there are four main guidelines and frameworks in practice for such. These are: top-down quality frameworks, bottom-up metrics related to quality aspects, empirical surveys related to modeling techniques, and pragmatic guidelines.\n\nHommes quoted Wang \"et al.\" (1994) that all the main characteristic of quality of models can all be grouped under 2 groups namely correctness and usefulness of a model, correctness ranges from the model correspondence to the phenomenon that is modeled to its correspondence to syntactical rules of the modeling and also it is independent of the purpose to which the model is used.\n\nWhereas the usefulness can be seen as the model being helpful for the specific purpose at hand for which the model is constructed at first place. Hommes also makes a further distinction between internal correctness (empirical, syntactical and semantic quality) and external correctness (validity).\n\nA common starting point for defining the quality of conceptual model is to look at the linguistic properties of the modeling language of which syntax and semantics are most often applied.\n\nAlso the broader approach is to be based on semiotics rather than linguistic as was done by Krogstie using the top-down quality framework known as SEQUAL. It defines several quality aspects based on relationships between a model, knowledge Externalisation, domain, a modeling language, and the activities of learning, taking action, and modeling.\n\nThe framework does not however provide ways to determine various degrees of quality but has been used extensively for business process modeling in empirical tests carried out \nAccording to previous research done by Moody \"et al.\" with use of conceptual model quality framework proposed by Lindland \"et al.\" (1994) to evaluate quality of process model, three levels of quality were identified:\n\n\nFrom the research it was noticed that the quality framework was found to be both easy to use and useful in evaluating the quality of process models however it had limitations in regards to reliability and difficult to identify defects. These limitations led to refinement of the framework through subsequent research done by Krogstie. This framework is called SEQUEL framework by Krogstie \"et al.\" 1995 (Refined further by Krogstie & Jørgensen, 2002) which included three more quality aspects.\n\n\nDimensions of Conceptual Quality framework\nModeling Domain is the set of all statements that are relevant and correct for describing a problem domain, Language Extension is the set of all statements that are possible given the grammar and vocabulary of the modeling languages used. Model Externalization is the conceptual representation of the problem domain.\n\nIt is defined as the set of statements about the problem domain that are actually made. Social Actor Interpretation and Technical Actor Interpretation are the sets of statements that actors both human model users and the tools that interact with the model, respectively 'think' the conceptual representation of the problem domain contains.\n\nFinally, Participant Knowledge is the set of statements that human actors, who are involved in the modeling process, believe should be made to represent the problem domain. These quality dimensions were later divided into two groups that deal with physical and social aspects of the model.\n\nIn later work, Krogstie et al. stated that while the extension of the SEQUAL framework has fixed some of the limitation of the initial framework, however other limitation remain .\nIn particular, the framework is too static in its view upon semantic quality, mainly considering models, not modeling activities, and comparing these models to a static domain rather than seeing the model as a facilitator for changing the domain.\n\nAlso, the framework's definition of pragmatic quality is quite narrow, focusing on understanding, in line with the semiotics of Morris, while newer research in linguistics and semiotics has focused beyond mere understanding, on how the model is used and affects its interpreters.\n\nThe need for a more dynamic view in the semiotic quality framework is particularly evident when considering process models, which themselves often prescribe or even enact actions in the problem domain, hence a change to the model may also change the problem domain directly. This paper discusses the quality framework in relation to active process models and suggests a revised framework based on this.\n\nFurther work by Krogstie \"et al.\" (2006) to revise SEQUAL framework to be more appropriate for active process models by redefining physical quality with a more narrow interpretation than previous research.\n\nThe other framework in use is Guidelines of Modeling (GoM) based on general accounting principles include the six principles: Correctness, Clarity deals with the comprehensibility and explicitness (System description) of model systems.\nComprehensibility relates to graphical arrangement of the information objects and, therefore, supports the understand ability of a model.\nRelevance relates to the model and the situation being presented. Comparability involves the ability to compare models that is semantic comparison between two models, Economic efficiency; the produced cost of the design process need at least to be covered by the proposed use of cost cuttings and revenue increases.\n\nSince the purpose of organizations in most cases is the maximization of profit, the principle defines the borderline for the modeling process. The last principle is Systematic design defines that there should be an accepted differentiation between diverse views within modeling.\nCorrectness, relevance and economic efficiency are prerequisites in the quality of models and must be fulfilled while the remaining guidelines are optional but necessary.\n\nThe two frameworks SEQUAL and GOM have a limitation of use in that they cannot be used by people who are not competent with modeling. They provide major quality metrics but are not easily applicable by non-experts.\n\nThe use of bottom-up metrics related to quality aspects of process models is trying to bridge the gap of use of the other two frameworks by non-experts in modeling but it is mostly theoretical and no empirical tests have been carried out to support their use.\n\nMost experiments carried out relate to the relationship between metrics and quality aspects and these works have been done individually by different authors: Canfora et al. study the connection mainly between count metrics (for example, the number of tasks or splits -and maintainability of software process models); Cardoso validates the correlation between control flow complexity and perceived complexity; and Mendling et al. use metrics to predict control flow errors such as deadlocks in process models.\n\nThe results reveal that an increase in size of a model appears to reduce its quality and comprehensibility.\nFurther work by Mendling et al. investigates the connection between metrics and understanding and While some metrics are confirmed regarding their effect, also personal factors of the modeler – like competence – are revealed as important for understanding about the models.\n\nSeveral empirical surveys carried out still do not give clear guidelines or ways of evaluating the quality of process models but it is necessary to have clear set of guidelines to guide modelers in this task. Pragmatic guidelines have been proposed by different practitioners even though it is difficult to provide an exhaustive account of such guidelines from practice.\nIn, 10 tips for process modeling are summarized, many technical definitions and rules are provided, but it does not teach how to create process models that are effective in their primary mission - maximizing shared understanding of the as-is or to-be process.\nMost of the guidelines are not easily put to practice but \"label activities verb–noun\" rule has been suggested by other practitioners before and analyzed empirically.\nFrom the research. value of process models is not only dependent on the choice of graphical constructs but also on their annotation with textual labels which need to be analyzed. It was found that it results in better models in terms of understanding than alternative labelling styles.\n\nFrom the earlier research and ways to evaluate process model quality it has been seen that the process model's size, structure, expertise of the modeler and modularity affect its overall comprehensibility.\n\n\n7PMG still though has limitations with its use: Validity problem 7PMG does not relate to the content of a process model, but only to the way this content is organized and represented.\nIt does suggest ways of organizing different structures of the process model while the content is kept intact but the pragmatic issue of what must be included in the model is still left out.\nThe second limitation relates to the prioritizing guideline the derived ranking has a small empirical basis as it relies on the involvement of 21 process modelers only.\n\nThis could be seen on the one hand as a need for a wider involvement of process modelers' experience, but it also rises the question what alternative approaches may be available to arrive at a prioritizing guideline.\n\n\n"}

He retired from Y&R in 1944 at age 52.\n\nRaymond Rubicam's innovative leadership and creativity led many to recognize him as \"advertising's statesman.\" Because his creative concepts and innovations have continued to play an important role in advertising as we know it today many people consider him the \"father of modern advertising\".\n\nAs a young copywriter for N.W. Ayer and Son, Rubicam was responsible for some of advertising's most memorable pieces. Steinway's \"The Instrument of the Immortals,\" Squibb's \"The Priceless Ingredient,\" and Rolls-Royce's \"No Rolls-Royce has ever worn out,\" were highly successful slogans which made him one of the industry's leading copywriters. While he enjoyed considerable success at N.W. Ayer, he felt that the agency failed to emphasize the importance of the creative artist in advertising. Rubicam, seeking to create an agency that valued artistic and creative talent over business, joined with James Orr Young to found Young & Rubicam in 1923.\n\nRubicam's skills and his recruitment of the industry's most talented specialists propelled Young & Rubicam into the forefront of advertising. David Ogilvy credited Rubicam with assembling \"the best team of copywriters and art directors in the history of advertising,\" whose advertisements \"were read by more people than any other agency's.\" The agency represented many of America's leading companies, such as Gulf Oil, General Electric, Johnson and Johnson, Fortune, Life and others.\n\nWhile Raymond Rubicam's emphasis on creativity was innovative in itself, his philosophy and copywriting approach revolutionized the industry. He believed that an advertisement should \"mirror the reader.\" Knowledge and understanding of the customer was a critical component of effective advertising. With the help of Dr. George Gallup, Rubicam pioneered new methods of consumer and media research. Young & Rubicam was the first agency to use scientific telephone sampling and to test audiences to measure the success of commercials and advertisements. The agency was also one of the first to produce their own programs, often integrating commercials into radio shows. The development of the \"sequence-picture copy\" was another Rubicam innovation. His was the first agency to use comic strips as a medium for advertising, creating \"Mr. Coffee Nerves\" for Postum and \"Little Alby\" for Grape-Nuts.\n\nUnder his direction, Young & Rubicam made significant contributions to the war effort during World War II. The agency donated its time and resources to the War Advertising Council, the Treasury Department on War Loan Drives and to the Department of Agriculture for farm labor recruitment campaigns. Independently, Rubicam served as a special assistant to the War Manpower Commission, director of United China Relief, and later as a member of the Committee for Economic Development. The CED worked to support the United States during the war and significantly influenced policy following its conclusion.\n\nRubicam also occupied several positions in the business world and contributed to the development of his community. He served as the director of the New York Life Insurance Company, Bates Manufacturing and Valley National Bank.\n\n"}

{"id": "7709451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7709451", "title": "Set-off (law)", "text": "Set-off (law)\n\nIn law, set-off or netting are legal techniques applied between persons with mutual rights and liabilities, replacing gross positions with net positions. It permits the rights to be used to discharge the liabilities where cross claims exist between a plaintiff and a respondent. The result being that the gross claims of mutual debt produces a single, net claim. The net claim is known as a net position. In other words, a set-off is the right of a debtor to balance mutual debts with a creditor. In bookkeeping terms, set-offs are also known as reconciliations. To determine a set-off, simply subtract the smaller debt from the larger. \n\nAny balance remaining due either of the parties is still owed, but the remainder of the mutual debts has been set off. The power of net positions is to reduce credit exposure, also holding regulatory capital requirement and settlement advantages, which contributes to market stability. In regard to the financial market, net positions are vital.\n\nWhilst netting and set off are often used interchangeably, the legal distinction is made between \"netting\", which describes the procedure for and outcome of implementing a \"set off\". By contrast \"set off\" describes the legal bases for producing net positions. \"Netting\" describes the form such as novation netting, or close-out netting, whilst \"set off\" describes judicially recognised grounds such as independent set off or insolvency set off. Therefore, a netting or setting off gross positions involves the use of offsetting positions with the same counter-party to address counter-party credit risk. This is to be differentiated from hedging which uses offsetting positions with multiple parties to mitigate risk.\n\nThe law does not permit counter-parties to use third party debt to set off against an un-related liability. All forms of set off requires mutuality between claim and cross claim. This protects property rights both inside insolvency and out, primarily by ensuring that a non-owner cannot benefit from insolvency.\n\nThe primary objective of netting is to reduce systemic risk by lowering the number of claims and cross claims which may arise from multiple transactions between the same parties. This prevents credit risk exposure, and prevents liquidators or other insolvency officers from cherry-picking transactions which may be profitable for the insolvent company. \n\nAt least three principle forms of netting may be distinguished in the financial markets. Each is heavily relied upon to manage financial market, specifically credit, risk\n\nAlso called rolling netting, netting by novation involves amending contracts by the agreement of the parties. This extinguishes the previous claims and replaces them with new claims.\n\nThis differs from settlement netting (outlined below) because the fusion of both claims into one, producing a single balance, occurs immediately at the conclusion of each subsequent contract. This method of netting is crucial in financial settings, particularly derivatives transactions, as it avoids cherry-picking in insolvency. The effectiveness of pre-insolvency novation netting in an insolvency was discussed in \"British Eagle International Airlines Ltd v Compagnie Nationale Air France\"[1975] 1 WLR 758. Similar to settlement netting, novation netting is only possible if the obligations have the same settlement date. This means that if, in the above example, transaction-2 was to be paid on Friday, the two transactions would not offset. Novation netting further cannot consolidate obligations. This is a systems intensive process requiring tracking of obligations as they become due.\n\nAn effective close-out netting scheme is said to be crucial for an efficient financial market. Close out netting differs from novation netting in that it extends to all outstanding obligations of the party under a master agreement similar to the one used by ISDA. These traditionally only operate upon an event of default of insolvency. In the event of counterparty bankruptcy or any other relevant event of default specified in the relevant agreement if accelerated (i.e. effected), all transactions or all of a given type are netted (i.e. set off against each other) at market value or, if otherwise specified in the contract or if it is not possible to obtain a market value, at an amount equal to the loss suffered by the non-defaulting party in replacing the relevant contract. The alternative would allow the liquidator to choose which contracts to enforce and which not to (and thus potentially \"cherry pick\"). There are international jurisdictions where the enforceability of netting in bankruptcy has not been legally tested.\nThe key elements of close out netting are:\nSimilar methods of close out netting exist to provide standardised agreements in market trading relating to derivatives and security lending such as\"repos\", forwards or options. The effect is that the netting avoids valuation of future and contingent debt by an insolvency officer and prevents insolvency officers from disclaiming executory contract obligations, as is allowed within certain jurisdictions such as the US and UK. The mitigated systemic risk which is induced by a close out scheme is protected legislatively. Other systemic challenges to netting, such as regulatory capital recognition under Basel II and other Insolvency-related matters seen in the \"Lamfalussy Report\" has been resolved largely through trade association lobbying for law reform. In England & Wales, the effect of \"British Eagle International Airlines Ltd v Compagnie Nationale Air France\" has largely been negated by \"Part VII\" of the Company Act 1989 which allows netting in situations which are in relation to money market contracts. In regard to the BASEL Accords, the first set of guidelines, BASEL I, was missing guidelines on \"netting\". BASEL II introduced \"netting\" guidelines.\n\nFor cash settled trades, this can be applied either bilaterally or multilaterally and on related or unrelated transactions.\nObligations are not modified under settlement netting, which relates only to the manner in which obligations are discharged. Unlike close-out netting, settlement netting is only possible in relation to like-obligations having the same settlement date. These dates must fall due on the same day and be in the same currency, but can be agreed in advance. Claims exist but are extinguished when paid. To achieve simultaneously payment, only the act of payment extinguishes the claim on both sides. This has the disadvantage that through the life of the netting, the debts are outstanding and netting will likely not occur, the effect of this on insolvency was seen in the above mentioned \"British Eagle\". These are routinely included within derivative transactions as they reduce the number and volume of payments and deliveries that take place but crucially does not reduce the pre-settlement exposure amount. \n\nSet off is a legal event and therefore legal basis is required for the proposition of when two or more gross claims are netted. Of these legal bases, a common form is the legal defense of set-off, which was originally introduced to prevent the unfair situation whereby a person (\"Party A\") who owed money to another (\"Party B\") could be sent to debtors' prison, despite the fact that Party B also owed money to Party A. The law thus allows both parties to defer payment until their respective claims have been heard in court. This operated as an equitable shield, but not a sword. Upon judgment, both claims are extinguished and replaced by a single net sum owing (e.g. If Party A owes Party B 100 and Party B owes Party A 105, the two sums are set off and replaced with a single obligation of 5 from Party B to Party A). Set-off can also be incorporated by contractual agreement so that, where a party defaults, the mutual amounts owing are automatically set off and extinguished.\n\nIn certain jurisdictions (including the UK), certain types of set-off takes place automatically upon the insolvency of a company. This means that, for each party which is both a creditor and debtor of the insolvent company, mutual debts are set-off against each other, and then either the bankrupt's creditor can claim the balance in the bankruptcy or the trustee in bankruptcy can ask for the balance remaining to be paid, depending on which side owed the most. The primary argument This has been criticized as an undeclared security interest that violates the principle of pari passu. The alternative, where a creditor has to pay all its debts, but receive only a limited portion of the leftover moneys that other unsecured creditors get, poses the danger of 'knock-on' insolvencies, and thus a systemic market risk. Seven still three core reasons underpin and justify the use of set-off. First, the law should uphold pre-insolvency autonomy and set-offs as parties invariably rely on the pre-insolvency commitments. This is a core policy point. Second, as a matter of fairness and efficiency both outside and inside insolvency reduces negotiation and enforcement costs. Third, managing risk, particularly systemic risk is crucially. Clearing house rules offer stipulation that relationships with buyer and sellers are replaced by two relationships between buyer and clearing house and seller and clearing out. Effect is automatic novation meaning all elements are internalised in current accounts. Can be in different currencies as long as they are converted at calculation. \n\nThe right to set off is particularly important when a bank's exposures are reported to regulatory authorities, as is the case in the EU under financial collateral requirements. If a bank has to report that it has lent a large sum to a borrower and so is exposed because of the risk that the borrower might default, thereby leading to the loss of the money of the bank or its depositors, is thus replaced. The bank has taken security over shares or securities of the borrower with an exposure of the money lent, less the value of the security taken.\n\nTwo primary examples of set-off rules are outlined below. These are in addition to the financial regulations pertaining to netting set out by trade associations and the European Union through the Financial Collateral Directives. \n\nUnder English law, there are broadly five types of set-off which have been recognised:\n\nThe five types of set off are extremely important as a matter of efficiency and of mitigating risk. Contractual set offs recognised as an incident of party autonomy whereas banker right of combination is considered a fundamental implied term. It is an essential aspect for cross-claims, especially when there exits overlapping obligations. Common features of set-off are that they are confined to situations where claim and cross claim are for money or reducible to money and it requires mutuality.\n\nSee De Magno v. United States, 636 F.2d 714, 727 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (district court had jurisdiction over claim involving VA’s “affirmative \naction against an individual whether by bringing an action to recover on an asserted claim or by proceeding on its common-law right of set-off”) (discussing similar language of predecessor statute, 38 U.S.C. § 211)\n\nSee, e.g., United States v.
