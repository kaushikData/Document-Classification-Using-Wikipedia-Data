{"id": "182310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=182310", "title": "American Institute of Certified Public Accountants", "text": "American Institute of Certified Public Accountants\n\nFounded in 1887, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) is the national professional organization of Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) in the United States, with more than 418,000 members in 143 countries in business and industry, public practice, government, education, student affiliates and international associates. It sets ethical standards for the profession and U.S. auditing standards for audits of private companies, non-profit organizations, federal, state and local governments. It also develops and grades the Uniform CPA Examination. The AICPA maintains offices in New York City; Washington, DC; Durham, NC; and Ewing, NJ. The AICPA celebrated the 125th anniversary of its founding in 2012.\n\nThe AICPA's founding defined accountancy as a profession characterized by educational requirements, professional standards, a code of professional ethics, and alignment with the public interest.\n\nThe AICPA and its predecessors date back to 1887, when the \"American Association of Public Accountants\" (AAPA) was formed. In 1916, the American Association of Public Accountants was succeeded by the \"Institute of Public Accountants\", at which time there was a membership of 1,150. The name was changed to the \"American Institute of Accountants\" in 1917 and remained so until 1957, when it changed to its current name of the \"American Institute of Certified Public Accountants\". The American Society of Certified Public Accountants was formed in 1921 and acted as a federation of state societies. The Society was merged into the Institute in 1936 and, at that time, the Institute agreed to restrict its future members to CPAs.\n\nIn January 2012, the AICPA entered into a joint venture with the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA), a partnership that produced the Chartered Global Management Accountant (CGMA) designation. \nIn 2014, the AICPA and the CIMA co-created the Global Management Accounting Principles (GMAPs). These principles, the result of research from across 20 countries in five continents, aim to guide best practices in the discipline of management accounting.\n\nIn June 2016, members of both the AICPA and CIMA approved evolving the joint venture through the creation of a new international association. The Association of International Certified Professional Accountants launched in 2017, bringing together the expertise and capabilities of the AICPA and CIMA to strengthen the entire accounting profession – both public and management accounting – through stronger advocacy, enhanced member resources and a broader platform to reach the next generation. The AICPA and CIMA membership bodies remain and provide all existing benefits to members.\n\nThe use of committees began even before the AAPA was formed in 1887. At the first meeting of what would become the AAPA on December 22, 1886, those present authorized the appointment of a committee to draft rules and regulations. Beyond this first preliminary committee the first Bylaws of the AAPA in 1897 established three committees: Finance and Audit Committee; Committee on Elections, Qualifications and Examinations; and the Committee on Bylaws. The number of committees grew continually over the years. In the 1940s, there were 34 committees. By 1960, there were 89. By 1970, the number had grown to 109.\n\nIn 1999, the nearly 120 existing committees underwent a re-organization with approximately half of the standing committees being replaced with a volunteer group model that placed an increased emphasis on the use of task forces. The increased use of task forces allowed for more targeted efforts with the task forces being given a specific assignment then disbanding upon completion of that assignment. Also in 1999, the first tracking and management of task forces began. Currently, 1,700 volunteers fill more than 2000 seats, each helping to fulfill the AICPA's mission.\n\nThe AICPA's mission is to \"Power the success of global business, CPAs, CGMAs and specialty credentials by providing the most relevant knowledge, resources and advocacy, and protecting the evolving public interest.\" To fulfill its mission, the AICPA works with state CPA organizations and gives priority to those areas where public reliance on CPA skills is most significant.\n\nThe AICPA sets \"generally accepted\" professional and technical standards for CPAs in multiple areas. Until the 1970s, the AICPA held a virtual monopoly in this field. In the 1970s, however, it transferred its responsibility for setting generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to the newly formed Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Following this, it retained its standards setting function in areas such as financial statement auditing, professional ethics, attest services, CPA firm quality control, CPA tax practice, business valuation, and financial planning practice. Before passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley law, AICPA standards in these areas were considered \"generally accepted\" for all CPA practitioners.\n\nIn the early 2000s, federal public policy makers concluded that where independent financial statement audits of public companies regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are concerned, that the AICPA's standards setting and related enforcement roles should be transferred to a government empowered body with more enforcement authority than a non-governmental professional association, such as the AICPA could provide. As a result, the Sarbanes-Oxley law created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) which has jurisdiction over virtually every area of CPA practice in relation to public companies. However, the AICPA retains its considerable standards setting, ethics enforcement and firm practice quality monitoring roles for the majority of practicing CPAs, who serve privately held business and individuals.\n\nThe AICPA offers credentialing programs in certain subject areas for its members. The credentials are similar to state board certifications for attorneys, which also recognize subject matter-specific expertise. The AICPA offers the Accredited in Business Valuation (ABV) credential, the Personal Financial Specialist (PFS) credential, the Certified in Financial Forensics (CFF) credential, the Certified Information Technology Professional (CITP) credential, and the Certified in Entity and Intangible Valuations (CEIV) credential.\n\nThe AICPA, along with CIMA, issues the Chartered Global Management Accountant (CGMA) designation, which is designed to elevate management accounting and further emphasize its importance for business worldwide. United by global quality standards for ethics and performance, CGMA designees maintain distinct credibility and positioning among worldwide business designations and have access to resources and learning opportunities that further elevate their expertise, skills, ethical standards, and dedication.\n\nThe AICPA also runs extensive public interest programs, most notably the multiple award-winning campaign Feed the Pig and the award-winning site 360 Degrees of Financial Literacy. Feed the Pig, a national public service campaign sponsored by the AICPA and the Ad Council, encourages Americans aged 25 to 34 to take control of their personal finances by providing free savings tips and resources. 360 Degrees of Financial Literacy is a national volunteer effort of the nation's CPAs to help Americans understand their personal finances and develop money management skills. It focuses on financial education as a lifelong endeavor, from children learning about the value of money to adults reaching a secure retirement.\n\nThe AICPA has a Washington office and a political action committee. On behalf of its members, the AICPA monitors and advocates on legislative and other matters that affect the accounting profession. Working with state CPA societies and other professional organizations, the AICPA provides information to and educates federal, state and local policymakers regarding key issues. Whether serving as an information resource or offering recommendations, the AICPA represents the profession while protecting the public interest.\n\nThe AICPA's Political Action Committee is a contributor to U.S. Congressional representatives and Senators from both parties who sit on various legislative committees of relevance to CPAs.\n\nThe AICPA is a leading member of the International Federation of Accountants and the Global Accounting Alliance.\n\nThe AICPA is an affiliate of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of the Caribbean.\n\nMembers of the AICPA must attest annually to meeting the requirements for their membership types, complying with the AICPA's bylaws and upholding the AICPA's Code of Profession Conduct. Members are subject to audit and, if found to be non-compliant, may be expelled from the AICPA.\n\n\n"}

It was used for entertainment and political meetings. It was a three-story building where bawdy \"concerts\" took place. The building had a front of 40 feet and a depth of 125 feet.\n\nOften called Mozart Hall, it was also a gathering place of anti-Tammany Hall political forces in New York City. Fernando Wood, New York Mayor and Congressman, founded the organization. The edifice burned entirely in the early morning hours of March 24, 1861.\n\nProceedings at the venue were frowned upon by newspaper writers such as one from \"The New York Times\". He commented about Canterbury Hall advertisements promoting \"the prettiest waiter girls in town\". Along with a rival theater, the Melodeon, the establishment was \"a nightly disgrace to Broadway and its adjacent streets\". In November 1860 the proprietors of the business, Fox & Curran, were compelled to pay a license fee of $500 to keep the venue open. A \"New York Times\" editorialist expressed the opinion that this was a first measure in ridding the city of such \"nuisances\", which he predicted the New York State Legislature would soon entirely eliminate.\n\nThe property on which Canterbury Hall stood was formerly owned by a Reverend Wiley. His estate encompassed additional buildings on Broadway and was insured for $15,000. The fire which consumed the structure began among stage scenery and was discovered by watchmen. The owners of Canterbury Hall suffered an estimated loss of $10,000. A fire marshal began an investigation into the cause of the fire which was considered to be of incendiary origin.\n"}

In 2009, she made her directorial debut with \"Serious Moonlight\". She is also a poker enthusiast with career winnings totaling $50,000. On August 2, 2014, Hines married Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a member of the Kennedy family.\n\nHines was born in Miami Beach, Florida, a daughter of James and Rosemary Hines.\n\nPart of her family came from Frostproof, Florida, but she grew up in Tallahassee, where she was a member of the Young Actors Theatre throughout high school. Hines also attended Lively Technical Center and Tallahassee Community College in Tallahassee. She was raised Catholic and has two brothers and a sister. She attended West Virginia University and Florida State University before graduating from the University of Central Florida.\n\nBefore getting her break in Hollywood, Hines worked as a waitress, television reporter, and telephone operator, as well as personal assistant to Rob Reiner, when she moved to Los Angeles to pursue acting. Though Reiner did not play a critical role in her career, he would watch her shows when she began acting. She has had guest appearances on television shows such as \"Swamp Thing\" and \"Unsolved Mysteries\". She also appeared on an episode of the Dating Game in 1996. She was not picked on the episode. \nHines began her acting career by doing improvisational comedy at The Groundlings Theater. Among the people she studied with was Lisa Kudrow. She also learned to write comedy sketches, which served her well when working on HBO's \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" as Larry David's fictional wife, Cheryl. The show is written using the retroscripting technique, in which the plot outlines are generally and loosely drawn, and the individual actors improvise to create the dialogue.\n\n\"When the show first came out, people from Tallahassee thought, 'Well, maybe Cheryl got married'\", she recalls of the show's initial reception. \"Sometimes, I do feel like I live two lives.\" Hines received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her work on \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" in 2003 and 2006.

{"id": "268508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=268508", "title": "Debt consolidation", "text": "Debt consolidation\n\nDebt consolidation is a form of debt refinancing that entails taking out one loan to pay off many others. This commonly refers to a personal finance process of individuals addressing high consumer debt but occasionally refers to a country's fiscal approach to corporate debt or Government debt. The process can secure a lower overall interest rate to the entire debt load and provide the convenience of servicing only one loan.\n\nDebt generally refers to money owed by one party, the debtor, to a second party, the creditor. It is generally subject to repayments of principal and interest. Interest is the fee charged by the creditor to the debtor, generally calculated as a percentage of the principal sum per year known as an interest rate and generally paid periodically at intervals, such as monthly. Debt can be secured with collateral or unsecured. \n\nAlthough there is variation from country to country and even in regions within country, consumer debt is primarily made up of home loans, credit card debt and car loans. Household debt is the consumer debt of the adults in the household plus the mortgage, if applicable. In many countries, especially the United States and the United Kingdom, student loans can be a significant portion of debt but are usually regulated differently than other debt. The overall debt can reach the point where a debtor is in danger of bankruptcy, insolvency, or other fiscal emergency. Options available to overburdened debtors include credit counseling and personal bankruptcy. \n\nOther consumer options include:\nSometimes the solution includes some of each of these tactics.\nThe bulk of the consumer debt, especially that with a high interest, is repaid by a new loan. Most debt consolidation loans are offered from lending institutions and secured as a second mortgage or home equity line of credit. These require the individual to put up a home as collateral and the loan to be less than the equity available. \n\nThe overall lower interest rate is an advantage of the debt consolidation loan offers consumers. Lenders have fixed costs to process payments and repayment can spread out over a larger period. However, such consolidation loans have costs: fees, interest, and \"points\" where one point equals to one percent of the amount borrowed. In some countries, these loans may provide certain tax advantages. Because they are secured, a lender can attempt to seize property if the borrower goes into default. \n\nPersonal loans comprise another form of debt consolidation loan. Individuals can issue debtors a personal loan that satisfies the outstanding debt and creates a new one on their own terms. These loans, often unsecured, are based on the personal relationship rather than collateral.\n\nIn the United States, federal student loans are consolidated somewhat differently from in the UK, as federal student loans are guaranteed by the U.S. government.\n\nIn a federal student loan consolidation, existing loans are purchased by the Department of Education. Upon consolidation, a fixed interest rate is set based on the then-current interest rate. Reconsolidating does not change that rate. If the student combines loans of different types and rates into one new consolidation loan, a weighted average calculation will establish the appropriate rate based on the then-current interest rates of the different loans being consolidated together.\n\nFederal student loan consolidation is often referred to as refinancing, which is incorrect because the loan rates are not changed, merely locked in. Unlike private sector debt consolidation, student loan consolidation does not incur any fees for the borrower; private companies make money on student loan consolidation by reaping subsidies from the federal government.\n\nIn the UK student loan entitlements are guaranteed, and are recovered using a means-tested system from the student's future income. Student loans in the UK can not be included in bankruptcy, but do not affect a person's credit rating because the repayments are deducted from salary at source by employers, similar to Income Tax and National Insurance contributions. Many students, however, struggle with commercial debt well after their courses have finished.\n\nAustralia’s student loan system once had 35 years to pay back loans, but it’s currently 15. Those seriously delinquent on student loans face arrest at the border. \n\nIn Japan, an increasing number of student loans are in arrears. This has caused the Asian nation to take harsher steps when it comes to lending determinations. In an effort to prevent future defaults, Japan has begun associating loan approvals to academic performance.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1570741", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1570741", "title": "Diamond clarity", "text": "Diamond clarity\n\nDiamond clarity is the quality of diamonds that relates to the existence and visual appearance of internal characteristics of a diamond called \"inclusions\", and surface defects, called \"blemishes\". Clarity is one of the four Cs of diamond grading, the others being carat, color, and cut.\n\nInclusions are solids, liquids, or gases that were trapped in a mineral as it formed. They may be crystals of a foreign material or even another diamond crystal, or may have produced structural imperfections, such as tiny cracks that make a diamond appear whitish or cloudy. The number, size, color, relative location, orientation, and visibility of inclusions can all affect the relative clarity of a diamond. A clarity grade is assigned based on the overall appearance of the stone under ten times magnification.\n\nMost inclusions present in gem-quality diamonds do not affect the diamonds' performance or structural integrity and are not visible to the naked eyes. However, large clouds can affect a diamond's ability to transmit and scatter light. Large cracks close to or breaking the surface may reduce a diamond's resistance to fracture.\n\nDiamonds with higher clarity grades are more valued, with the exceedingly rare \"Flawless\" graded diamond fetching the highest price. Minor inclusions or blemishes are useful, as they can be used as unique identifying marks analogous to fingerprints. In addition, as synthetic diamond technology improves and distinguishing between natural and synthetic diamonds becomes more difficult, inclusions or blemishes can be used as proof of natural origin.\n\nThere are several types of inclusions and blemishes, which affect a diamond's clarity to varying degrees. Features resulting from diamond enhancement procedures, such as laser lines, are also considered inclusions or blemishes.\n\nThe diamond industry uses the term \"internal characteristics\" instead of \"inclusions\". For natural diamonds, the \"internal characteristics\" in the diamond are growth crystals that give the diamond its character and unique fingerprint. When diamonds are graded, they are magnified at 10x power.\n\n\nIn 1952, Richard T. Liddicoat, along with Marquis Person, Joe Phillips, Robert Crowningshield and Bert Krashes began to work on a new diamond grading system which they called the \"diamond grading and evaluation appraisal\". In 1953, they released their new system which assessed three aspects of diamonds; make, color and clarity. They took terminology used in the industry at the time and refined the definitions to produce a clarity scale by which diamonds could be consistently graded. The system at that time contained nine grades: Flawless, VVS, VVS, VS, VS, SI, SI, I, and I. The 'I' of the I, and I grades originally stood for \"Imperfect\".\n\nDuring the 1970s, two changes were made to the system. Firstly, the \"Internally Flawless\" grade was added, as GIA noticed that many diamonds were being aggressively cut to remove any surface blemishes, and thereby reducing the cutting quality (\"make\") of the diamonds. The \"Internally Flawless\" grade gave diamond manufacturers a choice to leave blemishes on the surface of the stone, and achieve a grade higher than VVS. The second change made to the grading system was the introduction of the I grade. This change was made in response to a growing number of diamonds of very low clarity being cut.\n\nThe last change to the clarity grading system took place in the 1990s when the term \"imperfect\" was changed to \"included\".\n\nThe GIA diamond grading scale is divided into six categories and eleven grades. The clarity categories and grades are:\n\nGIA clarity grading is performed under 10x magnification with darkfield illumination. The GIA Laboratory uses as standard equipment binocular stereo microscopes which are able to zoom to higher magnifications. These microscopes are equipped with darkfield illumination, as well as an ultraviolet filtered overhead light. When grading is performed using a 10x handheld loupe, darkfield illumination is more difficult to achieve. The grader must use a light source in such a way that the base of the stone is lit from the side, and the crown of the stone is shielded from the light.\n\nAfter thoroughly cleaning the diamond, the diamond is picked up using tweezers in a girdle-to-girdle hold. The grader views the diamond for the first time through the table, studying the culet area of the stone for inclusions. The diamond is then set down and picked up with the tweezers in a table-to-culet hold. In this position, the diamond can be studied from the pavilion side, and the crown side, examining the diamond through each facet for inclusions. Once a sector of the diamond has been thoroughly examined, the grader rotates the diamond in the tweezer, so that the neighboring sector can be examined. The grader uses darkfield lighting to reveal characteristics, and alternates to reflected, overhead lighting to ascertain whether a characteristic lies within the stone, on the stones surface, or both. If the grader is using a stereo microscope, she may zoom in to a higher magnification to make closer observations of an inclusion, but then return to 10x magnification to make an assessment of its impact on the clarity grade.\n\nIf a stereo binocular microscope has been used, a final assessment using a 10x loupe is performed before the final judgment is made on the clarity of the stone. The grader first decides the clarity category of the diamond: none (FL, or IF for a blemish), minute (VVS), minor (VS), noticeable (SI), or obvious (I). The decision is then made on the grade of the diamond.\n\nThe clarity grading system developed by the GIA has been used throughout the industry as well as by other diamond grading agencies including the American Gemological Society (AGS), and the International Gemological Institute (IGI). There are other smaller labs which use the GIA system as well. These grading agencies base their clarity grades on the characteristics of inclusions visible to a trained professional when a diamond is viewed from above under 10x magnification.\n\nThe World Jewellery Confederation developed the \"International Clarity Scale\" for grading diamonds. This clarity scale mirrors the GIA grading scale, except nomenclature varies. The system names these clarity grades; Loupe Clean, Very, very small inclusions (VVS1 and VVS2), Very small inclusions (VS1 and VS2), Small inclusions (SI1 and SI2), Pique (P1, P2, and P3).\n\nClarity grading by WJC standards is by examination using a 10x achromatic, aplanatic loupe in normal light.\n\nThe American Gem Society grades clarity on a number scale between 0 and 10. These numbers grades correlate almost exactly with the GIA system, but with some differences. The flawless and internally flawless (0) grades are grouped together with notation defining whether the stone is free from external blemishes, the VVS through SI grades are numbered 1 through 6, and then there are four grades 7 through 10 for the included category.\n\nClarity grading by AGS standards requires examination using a binocular stereo microscope equipped with adjustable zoom magnification and darkfield illumination.\n\nThe IDC or the \"International Diamond Council\" uses a very similar standard to CIBJO. IDC \"loupe clean\" stones that have external blemishes have notations made on the grading report. IDC clarity grading is by examination using a 10x achromatic, aplanatic loupe in normal light.\n\nThe European Gemological Laboratory (EGL) introduced the SI3 as a clarity grade. While intended as a range to include borderline SI2 / I1 stones, it is now commonly used to mean I1's which are \"eye clean\", that is, which have inclusions which are not obviously visible to the naked eye.\n\nAll grades reflect the appearance to an experienced grader when viewed from above at 10x magnification, though higher magnifications and viewing from other angles are used during the grading process. The grader studies the diamond for internal characteristics and judges them on the basis of five clarity factors: size, number, position, nature, and color or relief. The clarity grade is assessed on the basis of the most noticeable inclusions, the so-called \"grade setting inclusions\". Less significant inclusions are ignored for the purposes of setting the grade; however, they may still be plotted onto a diamond plot chart.\n\nAccurate clarity grading as with other grading steps must be done with the diamond \"loose\", i.e. not set into any mounting. Inclusions are often difficult to see from the crown side of the diamond, and may be concealed by the setting.\n\nThe first clarity factor which is assessed is a clarity characteristic's size. Larger characteristics are typically more noticeable under magnification, thereby placing the diamond into a lower clarity grade.\n\nThe second clarity factor which is assessed is the number of clarity characteristics. Generally, the more characteristics, the lower the clarity grade. This assessment is made by judging how readily they can be seen, not by the actual number of characteristics.\n\nThe third clarity factor which is assessed is the characteristic's position. When an inclusion is directly under the table of the diamond it is most visible. An inclusion under the table and positioned close to a pavilion facet will reflect multiple times around the stone, giving this type of inclusion the name \"reflector\". Reflectors are graded as if each reflection were an inclusion (although in plotting the diamond it is only plotted once). For this reason, reflectors have a greater impact on the clarity grade. Inclusions become less visible when they are positioned under the crown facets, or near the girdle of the stone. These inclusions may often be more easily seen from the pavilion side of the diamond than from crown side of the diamond.\n\nAdditionally, the position of large feathers, knots and included crystals positioned where they extend to the girdle or crown of the stone affect the clarity grade. Diamonds worn in jewelry typically will withstand breakage, however inclusions of this nature and in these positions can pose a risk for further extension of the break in the structure of the diamond. Inclusions that are judged to pose at least a moderate risk of breakage to the stone are graded in the \"Included\" category.\n\nThe fourth clarity factor which is assessed is a characteristic's nature. The characteristic's nature determines whether it is internal (extending into the stone) or external (limited to the surface of the stone). Internal characteristics automatically exclude the diamond from the \"Flawless\", and \"Internally Flawless\" categories. External characteristics exclude the diamond from the \"Flawless\" category.\n\nAn internal characteristic of a diamond may be classified as a(n): bruise, cavity, chip, cleavage, cloud, crystal, feather, grain center, indented natural, internal graining, knot, laser drill hole, needle, pinpoint, or twinning wisp.\n\nAn external characteristic of a diamond may be classified as a(n): abrasion, natural, nick, pit, polish lines, polish mark, scratch, surface graining, or extra facet.\n\nThe nature will also determine whether an inclusion poses a risk to the stone. An inclusion that may cause a break in the crystal structure (included crystal, feather, knot, and cleavage) may, depending on its position, pose a moderate level of risk for further breakage.\n\nThe fifth clarity factor which is assessed is the color and relief of clarity characteristics. Characteristics that contrast with the surrounding diamond are said to have \"relief\". The degree to which this color and relief is noticeable affects the clarity grade of the diamond. Colored inclusions invariably show contrast and are more easily seen. An exception is a black pinpoint inclusion, which is often more difficult to see than a white pinpoint.\n\nDiamonds become increasingly rare when considering higher clarity gradings. Only about 20% of all diamonds mined have a clarity rating high enough for the diamond to be considered appropriate for use as a gemstone; the other 80% are relegated to industrial use. Of that top 20%, a significant portion contains an inclusion or inclusions that are visible to the naked eye upon close inspection. Those that do not have a visible inclusion when the gem is examined approximately 6 inches from the naked eye are known as \"eye-clean\", although visible inclusions can sometimes be hidden under the setting in a piece of jewelry. The most expensive gem diamonds fall within the VS and SI grades with FL, IF, and even VVS stones commanding significant premiums. FL and IF stones are sometimes referred to as \"museum quality\" or \"investment grade\" to denote their rarity although the term \"investment grade\" is misleading as diamonds have historically been illiquid and questionable stores of value.\n\nAs many diamond purchases are infrequent (e.g. engagement rings), there is a level of concern by end consumers having to pay large premiums for clarity grade differences that are important to the certificate or diamond industry, but not to the buying public, who generally cannot discern the difference with the naked eye.\n\nLaser \"drilling\" involves using a laser to burn a hole to a colored inclusion, followed by acid washing to remove the coloring agent. The clarity grade is the grade after the treatment. The treatment is considered permanent.\n\nClarity can also be \"enhanced\" by filling the fracture much like a car windshield crack can be treated. Such diamonds are sometimes called \"fracture filled diamonds\". Reputable vendors must disclose this filling and reputable filling companies use filling agents which show a flash of color, commonly orange or pink, when viewed closely. There is a significant price discount for fracture-filled diamonds. The GIA will not grade fracture-filled diamonds, in part because the treatment is not as permanent as the diamond itself. Reputable companies often provide for repeat treatments if heat causes damage to the filling. The heat required to cause damage is that of a blowtorch used to work on settings, and it is essential to inform anyone working on a setting if the diamond is fracture-filled, so they can apply cooling agents to the diamond and use greater care while working on it.\n\nGIA, as a matter of policy, does not grade clarity-enhanced diamonds but it will grade laser-drilled diamonds since it considers the enhancement to be permanent in nature. If a GIA report has the words \"clarity enhanced\" or \"fracture filled\", it is surely a counterfeit report.\n"}

He attended Glenelg Grammar School (run by F. I. Caterer), and after leaving school worked for various Adelaide firms. Allen married Effie Marian Conigrave in 1895 (with whom he later had two children), and in 1899 moved to Western Australia to work for her father, J. Fairfax Conigrave. He eventually went into business on his own, as an auctioneer, real estate agent, and shipping agent. He became secretary of the Perth Chamber of Commerce, and was also a director of a local building society. Allen served on the Perth City Council from 1904 to 1912 and again from 1915 to 1918. He first ran for parliament at the 1908 Legislative Council elections, but lost to Arthur Jenkins in Metropolitan Province.\n\nAt the 1911 state election, Allen was elected to parliament running for the newly formed Liberal Party. He replaced the retiring member in West Perth, Thomas Draper. Allen was re-elected at the 1914 election, but at the 1917 election was opposed by Draper, who had decided he wished to resume his parliamentary career. Both he and Draper stood for the Nationalist Party, which had been created earlier in the year, but Draper was more popular, winning back his former seat with 53.3 percent of the first-preference vote. Allen recontested West Perth at the 1921 election, but polled only the third-highest number of votes. Draper lost his seat regardless, with the winning candidate, Edith Cowan, becoming the first female member of parliament in Australia. Allen died in Perth in May 1931, aged 62. He committed suicide by shooting himself in the head on the Perth Esplanade, having had business troubles and been in poor physical health.\n"}

{"id": "25569540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25569540", "title": "Genomic counseling", "text": "Genomic counseling\n\nGenomic counseling is the process by which a person gets informed about his or her genome. In contrast to genetic counseling, which focuses on Mendelian diseases and typically involves person-to-person communication with a genetic counselor or other medical genetics expert, genomic counseling is not limited to currently clinically relevant information. It is often based on genomic information that is of interest for the informed person, such as increased risk for common complex disease that has actionable components (for example diabetes or obesity), genetically determined non-disease related traits (for example baldness), or recreational forms of information and genetic genealogy data. An individuals response to certain medications/drugs based on their pharmacogenomic profile may be provided. \n\nThe need for genomic counseling is currently driven by personal genomics companies, including 23andMe, Helix, and Pathway Genomics. Given the wealth and complexity of information obtained by personal genomics tests, genomic counseling can require expertise from a wide range of experts, including physicians, geneticists, molecular biologists, evolutionary biologists, population geneticists, statisticians, or bioinformaticians. Access of consumers to complete personal genomes through cheap full genome sequencing is likely to exacerbate this problem in the near future. There are currently not enough genetic counselors and clinical geneticists to help patients interpret whole-genome sequencing results regarding health-relevant information, and research shows that primary-care physicians lack the knowledge and expertise to help patients understand even single-gene test results.\n\nTypically, a family history is taken to more fully allow interpretation and incorporation of genomic data. Such an assessment is used to \"identify and quantify\" risk for inherited hereditary diseases. Whole genome sequencing and whole exome sequencing [WES] \"may not provide full coverage of critical genes\" and performing a risk assessment \"allows the genetic team to generate a differential diagnosis and order more sensitive genetic testing if necessary\".\n\n\"Whole genomes have gone from becoming that discovery technique to being present in the clinic on a regular basis\". Genomic counseling sessions may include briefings on \"general genetic principles, modes of inheritance, family/individual specific risk assessment, an in-depth discussion of the diagnosis and natural history, potential testing options, and case management for the condition occurring… or for which they are at risk\". The delivery of such information should be aimed to the patient's level of comprehension and take into account his or her culture and other personal context.\n\nChallenges in genetic counseling exists in both the decision and discussion of which incidental findings will be assessed and returned to patients. Patients may not be familiar with the condition and may be unable to make an informed opinion regarding the next steps in treatment. Genetic counselors and geneticists \"already sit on interpretation panels for determining what warrants disclosure\". This role will become \"increasingly relevant for all genetic counselors\" in order to ensure that all in the profession are \"proficient in variant interpretation and understand the laboratory and bioinformatics processes\" of such tests.\n\nQualifications for who can practice genomic counseling and what the practice will entail is up for debate as genetic counseling begins to incorporate genome counseling. A few changes that may see changes include the roles of risk assessments, education, and informed consent.\n\nTelegenetics is \"videoconferencing for clinical genetics services\" and is becoming an \"increasingly utilized method of delivering genetic counseling to rural areas\".\n\nDirect to consumer genetic testing (DTC GT) frequently utilizes telegenetics regardless of the client's \"geographical location or ability to attend face-to-face sessions\".\n\nThere has been very limited study of patients receiving potentially actionable genomic based results or the utilization of genetic counselors in the online result delivery process. A randomized controlled trial on 199 patients with chronic disease each receiving eight personalized and actionable complex disease reports online. Primary study aims were to assess the impact of in-person genomic counseling on 1) causal attribution of disease risk, 2) personal awareness of disease risk, and 3) perceived risk of developing a particular disease. Of 98 intervention arm participants (mean age = 57.8; 39% female) randomized for in-person genomic counseling, 76 (78%) were seen. In contrast, control arm participants (n = 101; mean age = 58.5; 54% female) were initially not offered genomic counseling as part of the study protocol but were able to access in-person genomic counseling, if they requested it, 3-months post viewing of at least one test report and post-completion of the study-specific follow-up survey. A total of 64 intervention arm and 59 control arm participants completed follow-up survey measures. We found that participants receiving in-person genomic counseling had enhanced objective understanding of the genetic variant risk contribution for multiple complex diseases. Genomic counseling was associated with lowered participant causal beliefs in genetic influence across all eight diseases, compared to control participants. Our findings also illustrate that for the majority of diseases under study, intervention arm participants believed they knew their genetic risk status better than control arm subjects. Disease risk was modified for the majority during genomic counseling, due to the assessment of more comprehensive family history. In conclusion, for patients receiving personalized and actionable genomic results through a web portal, genomic counseling enhanced their objective understanding of the genetic variant risk contribution to multiple common diseases. These results support the development of additional genomic counseling interventions to ensure a high level of patient comprehension and improve patient-centered health outcomes.\n\nLicensure poses a conflict for the provision of virtual genomic counseling. Medical practitioners are typically licensed to practice in the state in which they reside. In order to practice across state borders, the practitioner must apply for licensure in that state as well. Obtaining multiple licenses is costly and time consuming for practitioners who often don't want to deal with the hoops required to become duly licensed. Providers that do offer telemedicine or telegenetics services to out-of-state clients face \"civil and criminal sanctions for practicing medicine without a license\". Due to the limitation that licensure poses, clients who require the service of medical geneticists but live in a state with no licensed practitioners are required to travel to nearby states or go without the service.\n\n"}

After a crucial meeting in Bologna with music student Mauro Malavasi, who became his working partner and main songwriter and producer, they formed a disco production company called Goody Music Productions (GMP), invested in a recording studio in Bologna and created the Goody Music record label.\n\nIn 1978 the two released their first studio project called Macho which was followed by more or less commercially successful disco productions like Revanche and Peter Jacques band. But it wasn't until 1980, when their latest creation called Change was revealed, that Petrus and Malavasi established their own signature sound and reached their goal of world wide success. In 1979 Fred Petrus gathered his international music activities under the company name Little Macho Music.\n\nWhen Change hit the market in 1980 with their debut album \"The Glow of Love\" Petrus and Malavasi didn't realise the magnitude of the success that was to come. Petrus used two other Italian musicians besides Malavasi on this album, bassist Davide Romani and guitarist Paolo Gianolio. Romani – who not only wrote the number-one hits \"A Lover's Holiday\" and \"The Glow of Love\" (with vocals by Luther Vandross (who was hired by Petrus to perform together with Jocelyn Brown) – but also arranged and conducted the entire set in conjunction with Gianolio. Besides \"A Lover's Holiday\", which reached the number-one spot on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play for nine weeks, the album also received seven Grammy-Award nominations.\n\nAlthough similar to the famous disco band Chic, which was a source of inspiration for Romani, Change had their own slick and sophisticated blend of eurodisco and American Chic'esque R&B-flavored disco. From 1980 to 1983, when Chic's fame was waning, Change managed to climb higher on the charts each year. Although Jacques Fred Petrus released many other tracks with several other artists, none achieved the same fame and success as Change.\n\nEarly Petrus projects included Macho (1978), Elvin Shaad (1978), Peter Jacques Band (1979), Revanche (1979), Rudy (an album bringing the Italian Goody Music collaborator Rudy Trevisi to the front), Midnight Gang (1979), A.N.T.I. Rock (1980) (the Italian version of Ottawan's disco hit D.I.S.C.O.), The Jumpers (1980), Gianni Riso (1980) and Caprice (1980).\n\nAfter the tremendous hype with Change Petrus and Malavasi launched several new projects like The Brooklyn, Bronx and Queens band (B. B. & Q. band) in 1981, High Fashion (1982) (including the Romani/Malavasi penned hit \"Feelin' lucky lately\" which reached the No 32 spot on Billboards R&B chart), Silence (a pop album released in 1982) and Zinc (1982). Petrus and his troupe of Italian studio musicians and writers also co-wrote and produced parts of The Ritchie Family's 1982 album \"I'll do my Best\". The title track became a club hit, and was penned by Malavasi. Of all these new projects the B. B. & Q. band was by far the most successful concept. Their self-titled 1981 debut album included \"On the Beat\" (by Malavasi/Slade), a highly catchy and hypnotic dance floor filler with a powerful intro that rocketed to the No 8 spot on the Billboard black singles charts.\n\nDuring the second part of the 80's Petrus achieved success with album releases of B.B.&Q. Band (1985), Peter Jacques Band (1985) and Change (1985). Less successful projects in 1984 and 1985 (often single releases) included Silence 2 feat. Gordon Grody (1984), Macho III (1984), Kevin Johnson (1984), Zinc feat. Sherwin (1984), M Like Moon (1984), Midnight Gang (1984), Tato (1985), Nobel (1985) and Persuader (1985).

In 1985 he started up a new production company and record label called Renaissance International. Vedette International was the name of his new publishing company.\n\nIn 1986 the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the US federal government accused Jacques Fred Petrus of tax evasion.

{"id": "3469273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3469273", "title": "Kabushiki gaisha", "text": "Kabushiki gaisha\n\nA or kabushiki kaisha, commonly abbreviated KK, is a type of defined under the Companies Act of Japan. The term is often translated as \"stock company\", \"joint-stock company\" or \"stock corporation\".\n\nIn English, \"kabushiki kaisha\" is usually used, but the original Japanese pronunciation is \"kabushiki gaisha\" because of rendaku.\n\nA kabushiki kaisha must include \"株式会社\" in its name (Article 6, paragraph 2 of the Companies Act). In a company name, \"\" can be used as a prefix (e.g. \"Kabushiki gaisha Dentsū\", which is called \"\"mae-kabu\") or as a suffix (e.g. \"Toyota Jidōsha Kabushiki gaisha\", which is called \"ato-kabu\").\n\nMany Japanese companies translate the phrase \" in their name as \"Co., Ltd.\" but others use the more Americanized translations \"Corporation\" or \"Incorporated.\" Texts in England often refer to \"kabushiki gaisha\" as \"joint stock companies.\" While that is close to a literal translation of the term, the two are not the same. The Japanese government once endorsed \"business corporation\" as an official translation but now uses more literal translation \"stock company.\"\n\nJapanese often abbreviate \"\" in a company name on signage (including the sides of their vehicles) to in parentheses, as, for example, \".\" The full, formal name would then be \"\". is also combined into one Unicode character at code point U+337F (㍿).\n\nThe first \"kabushiki gaisha\" was the First National Bank of Japan, incorporated in 1873.\n\nRules regarding \"kabushiki gaisha\" were set out in the Commercial Code of Japan. During the Allied Occupation of Japan following World War II, the occupation authorities introduced revisions to the Commercial Code based on the Illinois Business Corporation Act of 1933, giving \"kabushiki gaisha\" many traits of American corporations.\n\nOver time, Japanese and U.S. corporate law diverged, and K.K. assumed many characteristics not found in U.S. corporations. For instance, a K.K. could not buy back its own stock (a restriction which still stands), issue stock for a price of less than ¥50,000 per share (effective 1982), or operate with paid-in capital of less than ¥10 million (effective 1991-2005).\n\nOn June 29, 2005, the Diet of Japan passed a new , which took effect on May 1, 2006. The new law greatly affected the formation and function of K.K.'s and other Japanese business organizations, bringing them closer to their contemporary counterparts in the U.S.\n\nA \"kabushiki gaisha\" may be started with capital as low as ¥1, making the total cost of a K.K. incorporation approximately ¥240,000 (about US$2,500) in taxes and notarization fees. Under the old Commercial Code, a K.K. required starting capital of ¥10 million (about US$105,000); a lower capital requirement was later instituted, but corporations with under ¥3 million in assets were barred from issuing dividends, and companies were required to increase their capital to ¥10 million within five years of formation.\n\nThe main steps in incorporation are the following:\n\nThe incorporation of a K.K. is carried out by one or more . Although seven incorporators were required as recently as the 1980s, a K.K. now only needs one incorporator, which may be an individual or a corporation. If there are multiple incorporators, they must sign a partnership agreement before incorporating the company.\n\n\nThe purpose statement requires some specialized knowledge, as Japan follows an ultra vires doctrine and does not allow a K.K. to act beyond its purposes. Judicial or administrative scriveners are often hired to draft the purposes of a new company.\n\nAdditionally, the articles of incorporation must contain the following if applicable:\n\nOther matters may also be included, such as limits on the number of directors and auditors. The Corporation Code allows a K.K. to be formed as a , or a (so-called) , in which case the company (e.g. its board of directors or a shareholders' meeting, as defined in the articles of incorporation) must approve any transfer of shares between shareholders; this designation must be made in the articles of incorporation.\n\nThe articles must be sealed by the incorporator(s) and notarized by a notary public, then filed with the Legal Affairs Bureau in the jurisdiction where the company will have its head office.\n\nIn a direct incorporation, each incorporator receives a specified amount of stock as designated in the articles of incorporation. Each incorporator must then promptly pay its share of the starting capital of the company, and if no directors have been designated in the articles of incorporation, meet to determine the initial directors and other officers.\n\nThe other method is an \"incorporation by offering,\" in which each incorporator becomes the underwriter of a specified number of shares (at least one each), and the other shares are offered to other investors. As in a direct incorporation, the incorporators must then hold an organizational meeting to appoint the initial directors and other officers. Any person wishing to receive shares must submit an application to the incorporator, and then make payment for his or her shares by a date specified by the incorporator(s).\n\nCapital must be received in a commercial bank account designated by the incorporator(s), and the bank must provide certification that payment has been made. Once the capital has been received and certified, the incorporation may be registered at the Legal Affairs Bureau.\n\nUnder present law, a K.K. must have a consisting of at least three individuals. Directors have a statutory term of office of two years, and auditors have a term of four years.\n\nSmall companies can exist with only one or two directors, with no statutory term of office, and . In such companies, decisions are made via shareholder meeting and the decision-making power of the directors is relatively limited. As soon as a third director is designated such companies must form a board.\n\nAt least one director is designated as a , holds the corporate seal and is empowered to represent the company in transactions. The Representative Director must \"report\" to the board of directors every three months; the exact meaning of this statutory provision is unclear, but some legal scholars interpret it to mean that the board must meet every three months. In 2015, the requirement that at least one director and one Representative Director must be a resident of Japan was changed. It is not required to have a resident Representative Director although it can be convenient to do so..\n\nDirectors are mandatories (agents) of the shareholders, and the Representative Director is a mandatory of the board. Any action outside of these mandates is considered a breach of mandatory duty.\n\nEvery K.K. with multiple directors must have at least one . Statutory auditors report to the shareholders, and are empowered to demand financial and operational reports from the directors.\n\nK.K.s with capital of over ¥500m, liabilities of over ¥2bn and/or publicly traded securities are required to have three statutory auditors, and must also have an annual audit performed by an outside CPA. Public K.K.s must also file securities law reports with the Ministry of Finance.\n\nUnder the new Company Law, public and other non-close K.K.s may either have a statutory auditor, or a , and structure similar to that of American public corporations.\n\nClose K.K.s may also have a single person serving as director and statutory auditor, regardless of capital or liabilities.\n\nA statutory auditor may be any person who is not an employee or director of the company. In practice, the position is often filled by a very senior employee close to retirement, or by an outside attorney or accountant.\n\nJapanese law does not designate any corporate officer positions. Most Japanese-owned kabushiki gaisha do not have \"officers\" \"per se\", but are directly managed by the directors, one of whom generally has the title of . The Japanese equivalent of a corporate vice president is a . Traditionally, under the lifetime employment system, directors and department chiefs begin their careers as line employees of the company and work their way up the management hierarchy over time. This is not the case in most foreign-owned companies in Japan, and some native companies have also abandoned this system in recent years in favor of encouraging more lateral movement in management.\n\nCorporate officers often have the legal title of shihainin, which makes them authorized representatives of the corporation at a particular place of business, in addition to a common-use title.\n\nKabushiki gaisha are subject to double taxation of profits and dividends, as are corporations in most countries. In contrast to many other countries, however, Japan also levies double taxes on close corporations (yugen gaisha and gōdō gaisha). This makes taxation a minor issue when deciding how to structure a business in Japan. As all publicly traded companies follow the K.K. structure, smaller businesses often choose to incorporate as a K.K. simply to appear more prestigious.\n\nIn addition to income taxes, K.K.s must also pay registration taxes to the national government, and may be subject to local taxes.\n\nGenerally, the power to bring actions against the directors on the corporation's behalf is granted to the statutory auditor.\n\nHistorically, derivative suits by shareholders were rare in Japan. Shareholders have been permitted to sue on the corporation's behalf since the postwar Americanization of the Commercial Code; however, this power was severely limited by the nature of court costs in Japan. Because the cost to file a civil action is proportional to the amount of damages being claimed, shareholders rarely had motivation to sue on the company's behalf.\n\nIn 1993, the Commercial Code was amended to reduce the filing fee for all shareholder derivative suits to ¥8,200 per claim. This led to a rise in the number of derivative suits heard by Japanese courts, from 31 pending cases in 1992 to 286 in 1999, and to a number of very high-profile shareholder actions, such as those against Daiwa Bank and Nomura Securities\n\n\n"}

He was Jewish, and having been sent to Auschwitz in 1942, served as the concentration camp's \"tatowierer\" (tattooist) until the camp was liberated near the end of World War II. He did not speak publicly about his wartime experiences until after the death of his wife in 2003 due to fears of being perceived as a Nazi collaborator.\n\nHe was born in Korompa, Kingdom of Hungary (now Krompachy, Slovakia), on 28 October 1916. In April 1942, Sokolov was part of the transport of Jewish prisoners to Auschwitz. Upon arrival, he was tattooed with the number 32407. He was set to work constructing housing blocks for the expanding camp but soon became ill with typhoid. Having recovered, he became the assistant to Pepan, the then \"tetovierer\" (tattooist) of the camp. Pepan \"disappeared\" roughly four weeks later and Sokolov took over as the \"tetovierer\". As such, he joined the Politische Abteilung and had an SS officer assigned to monitor him. His job meant he was \"a step further away from death than the other prisoners\", and he received a number of benefits such as a single room, extra rations, and free time when his work had been completed. \n\nLale met Gisela \"Gita\" Furman in July 1942 while tattooing an all-female group of new arrivals: he tattooed Gita with the number 34902. He had used his relatively privileged position to keep her alive by sending her extra food and messages through his personal guard, and having her \"moved to a better work station\". He was also involved in trading contraband (including jewellery) that given to him by fellow prisoners with locals in return for food and provisions.\n\nTwo days before the liberation of Auschwitz by Soviet troops (on 27 January 1945), Sokolov was moved to the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. He escaped that concentration camp, and returned to his native place, then part of Czechoslovakia. Knowing only Gita Fuhrmannova's name, he went to Bratislava, the main entry point for returning survivors, to search for her. After weeks of searching, she stepped out into the street in front of his horse. The couple married in 1945, and he changed his surname from Eisenberg to the more Russian-sounding Sokolov. He then opened a factory in Bratislava. During this time, he was involved in collecting money in support of the creation of the State of Israel. This activity and the nationalisation of industry by the country's communist government, resulted in him being imprisoned and having his business seized. He was soon released and the couple emigrated to Australia in 1948.\n\nIn Australia, Sokolov and his wife settled in Melbourne and opened up a clothing factory. Their only child, Gary, was born in 1961. Though his wife visited Europe a number of times, Sokolov never returned. Following Gita's death in 2003, he finally felt able to speak about his war-time experience having feared that he would be perceived as a collaborator. He would be interviewed by Heather Morris over the next three years, and she would write a book about his life which was published in 2018. He died in 2006, and is survived by his son.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1050798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1050798", "title": "Memorandum", "text": "Memorandum\n\nA memorandum (abbrev.: memo; from Latin \"memorandum est\", \"It must be remembered (that)...\") is a note, document or other communication that helps the memory by recording events or observations on a topic such as may be used in a business office. The plural form of the Latin noun \"memorandum\" so derived is properly \"memoranda\", but if the word is deemed to have become a word of the English language, the plural \"memorandums\", abbreviated to \"memos\", may be used. (See also Agenda, Corrigenda, Addenda).\n\nA memorandum can have only a certain number of formats; it may have a format specific to an office or institution. In law specifically, a memorandum is a record of the terms of a transaction or contract, such as a policy memo, memorandum of understanding, memorandum of agreement, or memorandum of association. Alternative formats include memos, briefing notes, reports, letters, binders, etc. They could be one page long or many. They may be considered as grey literature. If the user is a cabinet minister or a senior executive, the format might be rigidly defined and limited to one or two pages. If the user is a colleague, the format is usually much more flexible. At its most basic level, a memorandum can be a handwritten note to one's supervisor. In business, a memo is typically used by firms for internal communication, as opposed to letters which are typically for external communication. Hence, we can consider memoranda as an upward communication process through which any complaint, issues, opinion, views and suggestion are put forward to the authorized level.\n\nA specific type of memorandum is the policy briefing note (alternatively referred to in various jurisdictions and governing traditions as policy issues paper, policy memoranda, or cabinet submission amongst other terms), a document for transmitting policy analysis into the political decision making sphere. Typically, a briefing note may be denoted as either “for information” or “for decision”.\n\nThe origins of the term “briefing” lie in legal “briefs” and the derivative “military briefings”.\n\nThe primary purpose of a briefing note “for decision” is to support decision making – and also to “help (or sometimes influence) a decision-maker to make a better decision in a particular problem situation than he might otherwise have made without the analysis”. Other purposes that the briefing note can serve include: conveying information; informing decisions, making a request, providing a response to a question, making a suggestion, presenting an informal report, proposing a solution to a problem, or documenting a reference for future use.\n\nAs the communication mechanism of the policy analysis process, the briefing note should provide a coherent synopsis of a policy problem, identify different policy options for addressing the problem, articulate opposing perspectives and advocate a recommended option. The typical structure for a briefing note includes a description of the proposed policy; relevant background information; a discussion of key considerations (including implementation concerns, financial considerations, stakeholder impacts, and possible unanticipated consequences), a summary of arguments for and against the policy and a recommended decision. Policy documents that start with a proposal and assemble an argument that position are more accurately referred to as a government white paper. A government green paper which raises a policy option and is meant to open a dialogue on the proposal is more similar in tone to a briefing note than is a white paper.\n\nThere is no universal standard for a briefing note, but it is generally understood to be a concise, coherent summary of a public policy problem with a clearly articulated logic for following a recommended course of action. ”Next to a political nose, and a logical brain, the most important skill of the good treasury [person] resides in [their] fine drafting hand. The concise, coherent and penetrating note is the final expression of all other talents.” In many Westminster / Whitehall governance settings, policy analysts are expected to analyze the issue and write the briefing note from a neutral public service perspective. However, the briefing note “for decision” must contain a recommendation, acknowledging that “to say anything of importance in public policy requires value judgments, which must be explained and justified”.\n\n\n"}

Mobile file management software is typically installed on a corporate file server like Windows 2008, and on a mobile device such as tablet computers and smartphones, e.g., Android, iPad, iPhone, etc. Other features include the ability to remotely wipe a lost or stolen device, access, cache and store files on a mobile device and integrate with file permission solutions like those from Microsoft's Active Directory.\n\nA main advantage of modern mobile file management solutions is that they do not need a VPN connection for the mobile devices to connect to the corporate file servers. The connection between the mobile device and the corporate file server is established via a cloud service. This way the corporate file server doesn't need to open incoming ports which would cause security issues. The files are transferred highly encrypted e.g. according to AES 256-bit industry standard. Only the company server and the mobile device keep the encryption key to be able to encrypt and decrypt the files. So nobody, not even the mobile file management solution provider, can access the files.\n\nThird-party cloud-based companies provide solutions which can be used to manage mobile files but are not controlled by corporate IT organizations. Companies that utilize Mobile Device Management solutions can also secure content on mobile devices, but usually cannot provide direct access and connection to a corporate file server.\n\nFile management is how the computer operating system keeps data organized through the use of files and folders, how they are arranged, and how they are listed in a hierarchical order. Mobile file management allows file management to be used on tablet computers. By installing it both on the tablet and the corporate server, users of mobile devices can freely access corporate servers from remote locations.\n\n"}

{"id": "24512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24512", "title": "Peter principle", "text": "Peter principle\n\nThe Peter principle is a concept in management developed by Laurence J. Peter, which observes that people in a hierarchy tend to rise to their \"level of incompetence\". In other words, an employee is promoted based on their success in previous jobs until they reach a level at which they are no longer competent, as skills in one job do not necessarily translate to another. The concept was elucidated in the 1969 book The Peter Principle by Peter and Raymond Hull.\n\n\"The Peter Principle\" was published by William Morrow and Company in 1969. Peter and Hull intended the book to be satire, but it became popular as it was seen to make a serious point about the shortcomings of how people are promoted within hierarchical organizations. Hull wrote the text, based on Peter's research.\n\nThe Peter principle has been the subject of much later commentary and research.\n\nThe Peter principle states that a person who is competent at their job will earn promotion to a more senior position which requires different skills. If the promoted person lacks the skills required for their new role, then they will be incompetent at their new level, and so they will not be promoted again. But if they are competent at their new role, then they will be promoted again, and they will continue to be promoted until they eventually reach a level at which they are incompetent. Being incompetent, they do not qualify to be promoted again, and so remain stuck at that final level for the rest of their career (termed \"Final Placement\" or \"Peter's Plateau\"). This outcome is inevitable, given enough time and assuming that there are enough positions in the hierarchy to promote competent employees to. The \"Peter Principle\" is therefore expressed as: \"In a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence.\" This leads to Peter's Corollary: \"In time, every post tends to be occupied by an employee who is incompetent to carry out its duties.\" Hull calls the study of how hierarchies work \"hierarchiology.\"\n\nLaurence J. Peter had conducted the research that led to the formulation of the Peter principle well before publishing his findings. He worked with Raymond Hull on a book that elucidated his observations about hierarchies. The principle is named for Peter because although Hull actually wrote the book, it is a summary of Peter's research. \"The Peter Principle\" was published by William Morrow and Company in 1969.\n\nIn chapters 1 and 2, Peter and Hull give various examples of the Peter principle in action. A competent mechanic may make an incompetent foreman; a competent school teacher may make a competent assistant principal, but then go on to be an incompetent principal, and therefore will not be considered for promotion to assistant superintendent; a military officer may be promoted all the way up through the ranks to general and still be competent at that rank, but then make an incompetent field marshal. In each case, the higher position required skills which were not required at the level immediately below. The mechanic only had to know how to fix cars, but as a foreman he needed to be able to manage the other mechanics and deal with customers. The teacher was competent at educating children, and as assistant principal he was good at dealing with parents and other teachers, but as principal he was poor at maintaining good relations with the school board and the superintendent. The general was capable at dealing with ordinary soldiers, but as a field marshal he did not know how to liaise with politicians and the field marshals of his country's allies. They conclude that \"this could happen to every employee in every hierarchy.\"\n\nIn chapter 3, Peter and Hull discuss apparent exceptions to this principle and then debunk them. One of these illusory exceptions is when someone who is incompetent is still promoted anyway. This is known as \"percussive sublimation\" (i.e. being \"kicked upstairs\"). But it is only a pseudo-promotion: a move from one unproductive position to another; whereas a true promotion is a move from a position of competence (either to a position of competence or to a position of incompetence). This improves staff morale, as other employees believe that they too can be promoted again. Another pseudo-promotion is the \"lateral arabesque\", when a person is moved out of the way and given a longer job title.\n\nCompetence is measured by the employer, not by the customers or anyone else outside the hierarchy. \"Competence, like truth, beauty and contact lenses, is in the eye of the beholder.\" So people who \"appear\" to outsiders to be incompetent because they follow the rules of the organisation to an extent which actually impedes their effectiveness are still deemed competent by their immediate superior, because \"internal consistency is valued more highly than efficient service\". This is dubbed \"Peter's Inversion,\" because the \"means\" have become more important than the \"ends\". Those who value the means more than the ends are called \"Peter's Inverts.\"\n\nWhile incompetence is merely a barrier to further promotion, \"super-incompetence\" is grounds for dismissal. So is super-competence. The competence of employees at a given level can be represented by a bell curve: the majority are either competent or incompetent and so can remain employed, but a small number of outliers are either super-incompetent or super-competent, and in both cases \"they tend to disrupt the hierarchy.\" They are therefore expelled in order to preserve the hierarchy; a process called \"hierarchical exfoliation\". One example of a super-competent employee is a teacher of children with special needs who was so effective at educating them that after a year they exceeded all expectations at reading and arithmetic, but the teacher was still fired because he had neglected to devote enough time to bead-stringing and finger-painting.\n\nChapters 4 and 5 deal with the methods of achieving promotion: \"Push\" and \"Pull.\" Push means the employee's own efforts, such as working hard and taking self-improvement courses. This is usually not very effective, because of the Seniority Factor: the next level up is often fully occupied, blocking the path to promotion. (Murdering one's immediate superiors can be an effective way of overcoming this obstacle, but as this is such a rare phenomenon it does not really affect Peter and Hull's assessment of Push.) Pull is far more effective, and refers to accelerated promotion brought about by the efforts of an employee's mentors or patrons. It is better to have as many patrons as possible, because each additional patron produces a multiplying effect on their combined effectiveness, as patrons reinforce their positive opinion of the employee by discussing him with each other (\"Hull's Theorem\").\n\nChapter 6 explains why \"good followers do not become good leaders.\" In chapter 7, Peter and Hull describe the effect of the Peter Principle in politics and government. Chapter 8, entitled \"Hints and Foreshadowings\", discusses the work of earlier writers on the subject of incompetence, such as Sigmund Freud, Karl Marx and Alexander Pope.\n\nChapter 9 explains that once employees have reached their level of incompetence, they always lack insight into their situation. Most don't realise that they are incompetent, but those who do recognise their own incompetence still never realise that it is because they have been promoted, and so they futilely search for other explanations instead. In this chapter, Peter and Hull go on to explain why aptitude tests don't work and are actually counter-productive. Finally, they describe \"Summit Competence\": when someone reaches the highest level in their organisation and yet is still competent at that level. This is only because there were not enough ranks in the hierarchy, or because they did not have time to reach a level of incompetence. Such people often seek a level of incompetence in another hierarchy. For example, Socrates was an outstanding teacher but a terrible defence attorney. This is known as \"Compulsive Incompetence.\"\n\nChapter 10 explains why trying to assist an incompetent employee by promoting another employee to act as his assistant doesn't work. \"Incompetence plus incompetence equals incompetence.\"\n\nChapters 11 and 12 describe the various medical and psychological manifestations of stress which may result when someone reaches his level of incompetence, as well as other symptoms such as certain characteristic habits of speech or behaviour.\n\nChapter 13 considers whether it is possible for an employee who has reached his level of incompetence to be happy and healthy once he gets there. The answer is no, if he realises his true situation, and yes if he does not. Those who realise that they are incompetent usually think (mistakenly) that this is only because they are not working hard enough, and so they work themselves harder until they burn out or damage their health. So facing the sordid truth is not recommended. Those who have not realised that they are at their level of incompetence remain happy and healthy because they substitute irrelevant duties for the proper duties of their post, and excel at those instead. Peter and Hull describe six different Substitution techniques.\n\nIn chapter 14 various ways of avoiding promotion to the final level are described. Attempting to refuse an offered promotion is ill-advised, and is only practicable if the employee is not married and has no-one else to answer to. Generally it is better to avoid being considered for promotion in the first place, by pretending to be incompetent while one is actually still employed at a level of competence. This is \"Creative Incompetence,\" and several examples of successful techniques are given. It works best if the chosen field of incompetence does not actually impair one's work.\n\nThe concluding chapter applies Peter's Principle to the entire human species at an evolutionary level, and asks whether humanity can survive in the long run, or will become extinct upon reaching its level of incompetence as technology advances.\n\nOther commenters made observations similar to the Peter principle long before Peter's research. Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's 1763 play \"Minna von Barnhelm\" features an army sergeant who shuns the opportunity to move up in the ranks, saying \"I am a good sergeant; I might easily make a bad captain, and certainly an even worse general. One knows from experience.\" Similarly, Carl von Clausewitz (1780–1831) wrote that \"there is nothing more common than to hear of men losing their energy on being raised to a higher position, to which they do not feel themselves equal.\" Closely echoing Peter, Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset (1883–1955) wrote, \"All public employees should be demoted to their immediately lower level, as they have been promoted until turning incompetent.\"\n\nA number of scholars have engaged in research interpreting the Peter principle and its effects. In 2000, Edward Lazear explored two possible explanations for the phenomenon. First is the idea that employees work harder to gain a promotion, and then slack off once it is achieved. The other is that it is a statistical process: workers who are promoted have passed a particular benchmark of productivity based on factors that cannot necessarily be replicated in their new role, leading to a Peter principle situation. Lazear concluded that the former explanation only occurs under particular compensation structures, whereas the latter always holds up.\n\nAlessandro Pluchino, Andrea Rapisarda, and Cesare Garofalo used an agent-based modelling approach to simulate the promotion of employees in a system where the Peter principle is assumed to be true. They found that the best way to improve efficiency in an enterprise is to promote people randomly, or to shortlist the best and the worst performer in a given group, from which the person to be promoted is then selected randomly. For this work, they won the 2010 edition of the parody Ig Nobel Prize in management science.\n\nIn 2018, professors Alan Benson, Danielle Li, and Kelly Shue analyzed sales workers' performance and promotion practices at 214 American businesses to test the veracity of the Peter principle. They found that these companies tended to promote employees to management position based on their performance in their previous position, rather than based on managerial potential. Consistent with the Peter principle, the researchers found that high performing sales employees were likelier to be promoted, and that they were likelier to perform poorly as managers, leading to considerable costs to the businesses.\n\nThe Peter principle inspired Scott Adams, creator of the comic strip \"Dilbert\", to develop a similar concept, the Dilbert principle. The Dilbert principle holds that incompetent employees are promoted to management positions to get them out of the workflow. Adams explained the idea in his 1996 business book \"The Dilbert Principle\", and it has since been analyzed alongside the Peter principle. João Ricardo Faria wrote that the Dilbert principle is \"a sub-optimal version of the Peter principle,\" and leads to even lower profitability than the Peter principle.\n\nCompanies and organizations shaped their policies to contend with the Peter principle. Lazear stated that some companies expect that productivity will \"regress to the mean\" following promotion in their hiring and promotion practices. Other companies have adopted \"up or out\" strategies, such as the Cravath System, in which employees who do not advance are periodically fired. The Cravath System was developed at the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore, which made a practice of hiring chiefly recent law graduates, promoting internally and firing employees who do not perform at the required level. Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths have suggested the additive increase/multiplicative decrease algorithm as a solution to the Peter principle less severe than firing employees who fail to advance. They propose a dynamic hierarchy in which employees are regularly either promoted or reassigned to a lower level, so that any worker who is promoted to their point of failure is soon moved to an area where they are productive.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "206886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=206886", "title": "Program evaluation and review technique", "text": "Program evaluation and review technique\n\nThe program (or project) evaluation and review technique (PERT) is a statistical tool used in project management, which was designed to analyze and represent the tasks involved in completing a given project. \n\nFirst developed by the United States Navy in the 1950s, it is commonly used in conjunction with the critical path method (CPM).\n\nProject Evaluation and Review Techniques is commonly abbreviated to PERT.\nPERT is a method of analyzing the tasks involved in completing a given project, especially the time needed to complete each task, and to identify the minimum time needed to complete the total project. It incorporates uncertainty by making it possible to schedule a project while not knowing precisely the details and durations of all the activities. It is more of an event-oriented technique rather than start- and completion-oriented, and is used more in projects where time is the major factor rather than cost. It is applied to very large-scale, one-time, complex, non-routine infrastructure and Research and Development projects.\n\nProgram Evaluation Review Technique (PERT) offers a management tool, which relies \"on arrow and node diagrams of \"activities\" and \"events\": arrows represent the \"activities\" or work necessary to reach the \"events\" or nodes that indicate each completed phase of the total project.\"\n\nPERT and CPM are complementary tools, because \"CPM employs one time estimate and one cost estimate for each activity; PERT may utilize three time estimates (optimistic, expected, and pessimistic) and no costs for each activity. Although these are distinct differences, the term PERT is applied increasingly to all critical path scheduling.\"\n\n\"PERT\" was developed primarily to simplify the planning and scheduling of large and complex projects. It was developed for the U.S. Navy Special Projects Office in 1957 to support the U.S. Navy's Polaris nuclear submarine project. It found applications all over industry. An early example was it was used for the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble which applied PERT from 1965 until the opening of the 1968 Games. This project model was the first of its kind, a revival for scientific management, founded by Frederick Taylor (Taylorism) and later refined by Henry Ford (Fordism). DuPont's critical path method was invented at roughly the same time as PERT.\nInitially PERT stood for \"Program Evaluation Research Task,\" but by 1959 was already renamed. It had been made public in 1958 in two publications of the U.S. Department of the Navy, entitled \"Program Evaluation Research Task, Summary Report, Phase 1.\" and \"Phase 2.\" In a 1959 article in \"The American Statistician\" the main Willard Fazar, Head of the Program Evaluation Branch, Special Projects Office, U.S. Navy, gave a detailed description of the main concepts of the PERT. He explained:\n\nTen years after the introduction of PERT in 1958 the American librarian Maribeth Brennan published a selected bibliography with about 150 publications on PERT and CPM, which had been published between 1958 and 1968. The origin and development was summarized as follows:\nFor the subdivision of work units in PERT another tool was developed: the Work Breakdown Structure. The Work Breakdown Structure provides \"a framework for complete networking, the Work Breakdown Structure was formally introduced as the first item of analysis in carrying out basic PERT/COST.\"\n\nIn a PERT diagram, the main building block is the \"event\", with connections to its known predecessor events and successor events.\n\nBesides events, PERT also knows activities and sub-activities:\n\nPERT has defined four types of time required to accomplish an activity:\n\nPERT supplies a number of tools for management with determination of concepts, such as:\n\nThe first step to scheduling the project is to determine the tasks that the project requires and the order in which they must be completed. The order may be easy to record for some tasks e.g.When building a house, the land must be graded before the foundation can be laid) while difficult for others (there are two areas that need to be graded, but there are only enough bulldozers to do one). Additionally, the time estimates usually reflect the normal, non-rushed time. Many times, the time required to execute the task can be reduced for an additional cost or a reduction in the quality.\n\nIn the following example there are seven tasks, labeled \"A\" through \"G\". Some tasks can be done concurrently (\"A\" and \"B\") while others cannot be done until their predecessor task is complete (\"C\" cannot begin until \"A\" is complete). Additionally, each task has three time estimates: the optimistic time estimate (\"o\"), the most likely or normal time estimate (\"m\"), and the pessimistic time estimate (\"p\"). The expected time (\"te\") is computed using the formula (\"o\" + 4\"m\" + \"p\") ÷ 6.\n\nOnce this step is complete, one can draw a Gantt chart or a network diagram.\n\nA network diagram can be created by hand or by using diagram software. There are two types of network diagrams, activity on arrow (AOA) and activity on node (AON). Activity on node diagrams are generally easier to create and interpret. To create an AON diagram, it is recommended (but not required) to start with a node named \"start\". This <nowiki>\"activity\"</nowiki> has a duration of zero (0). Then you draw each activity that does not have a predecessor activity (\"a\" and \"b\" in this example) and connect them with an arrow from start to each node. Next, since both \"c\" and \"d\" list \"a\" as a predecessor activity, their nodes are drawn with arrows coming from \"a\". Activity \"e\" is listed with \"b\" and \"c\" as predecessor activities, so node \"e\" is drawn with arrows coming from both \"b\" and \"c\", signifying that \"e\" cannot begin until both \"b\" and \"c\" have been completed. Activity \"f\" has \"d\" as a predecessor activity, so an arrow is drawn connecting the activities. Likewise, an arrow is drawn from \"e\" to \"g\". Since there are no activities that come after \"f\" or \"g\", it is recommended (but again not required) to connect them to a node labeled \"finish\".\n\nBy itself, the network diagram pictured above does not give much more information than a Gantt chart; however, it can be expanded to display more information. The most common information shown is:\n\nIn order to determine this information it is assumed that the activities and normal duration times are given. The first step is to determine the ES and EF. The ES is defined as the maximum EF of all predecessor activities, unless the activity in question is the first activity, for which the ES is zero (0). The EF is the ES plus the task duration (EF = ES + duration).\n\n\nBarring any unforeseen events, the project should take 19.51 work days to complete. The next step is to determine the late start (LS) and late finish (LF) of each activity. This will eventually show if there are activities that have slack. The LF is defined as the minimum LS of all successor activities, unless the activity is the last activity, for which the LF equals the EF. The LS is the LF minus the task duration (LS = LF − duration).\n\n\nThe next step is to determine the critical path and if any activities have slack. The critical path is the path that takes the longest to complete. To determine the path times, add the task durations for all available paths. Activities that have slack can be delayed without changing the overall time of the project. Slack is computed in one of two ways, slack = LF − EF \"or\" slack = LS − ES. Activities that are on the critical path have a slack of zero (0).\n\n\nThe critical path is \"aceg\" and the critical time is 19.51 work days. It is important to note that there can be more than one critical path (in a project more complex than this example) or that the critical path can change. For example, let's say that activities \"d\" and \"f\" take their pessimistic (b) times to complete instead of their expected (T) times. The critical path is now \"adf\" and the critical time is 22 work days. On the other hand, if activity \"c\" can be reduced to one work day, the path time for \"aceg\" is reduced to 15.34 work days, which is slightly less than the time of the new critical path, \"beg\" (15.67 work days).\n\nAssuming these scenarios do not happen, the slack for each activity can now be determined.\n\n\nTherefore, activity \"b\" can be delayed almost 4 work days without delaying the project. Likewise, activity \"d\" or activity \"f\" can be delayed 4.68 work days without delaying the project (alternatively, \"d\" and \"f\" can be delayed 2.34 work days each).\n\n\n\nDuring project execution, however, a real-life project will never execute exactly as it was planned due to uncertainty. This can be due to ambiguity resulting from subjective estimates that are prone to human errors or can be the result of variability arising from unexpected events or risks. The main reason that PERT may provide inaccurate information about the project completion time is due to this schedule uncertainty. This inaccuracy may be large enough to render such estimates as not helpful.\n\nOne possible method to maximize solution robustness is to include safety in the baseline schedule in order to absorb the anticipated disruptions. This is called \"proactive scheduling\". A pure proactive scheduling is a utopia; incorporating safety in a baseline schedule which allows for every possible disruption would lead to a baseline schedule with a very large make-span. A second approach, termed \"reactive scheduling\", consists of defining a procedure to react to disruptions that cannot be absorbed by the baseline schedule.\n"}

A promissory note alone is typically unsecured.\n\nThe term note payable is commonly used in accounting (as distinguished from accounts payable) or commonly as just a \"note\", it is internationally defined by the \"Convention providing a uniform law for bills of exchange and promissory notes\", but regional variations exist. A banknote is frequently referred to as a promissory note, as it is made by a bank and payable to bearer on demand. Mortgage notes are another prominent example.\n\nIf the promissory note is unconditional and readily saleable, it is called a negotiable instrument.\n\nDemand promissory notes are notes that do not carry a specific maturity date, but are due on demand of the lender. Usually the lender will only give the borrower a few days' notice before the payment is due.\n\nPromissory notes may be used in combination with security agreements. For example, a promissory note may be used in combination with a mortgage, in which case it is called a mortgage note.\n\nIn common speech, other terms, such as \"loan\", \"loan agreement\", and \"loan contract\" may be used interchangeably with \"promissory note\". The term \"loan contract\" is often used to describe a contract that is lengthy and detailed.\n\nA promissory note is very similar to a loan. Each is a legally binding contract to unconditionally repay a specified amount within a defined time frame. However, a promissory note is generally less detailed and less rigid than a loan contract. For one thing, loan agreements often require repayment in installments, while promissory notes typically do not. Furthermore, a loan agreement usually includes the terms for recourse in the case of default, such as establishing the right to foreclose, while a promissory note does not.\n\nPromissory notes differ from IOUs in that they contain a specific promise to pay along with the steps and timeline for repayment as well as consequences if repayment fails. IOUs only acknowledge that a debt exists.\n\nNegotiable instruments are unconditional and impose few to no duties on the issuer or payee other than payment. In the United States, whether a promissory note is a negotiable instrument can have significant legal impacts, as only negotiable instruments are subject to Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code and the application of the holder in due course rule. The negotiability of mortgage notes has been debated, particularly due to the obligations and \"baggage\" associated with mortgages; however, in mortgages notes are often determined to be negotiable instruments.\n\nIn the United States, the Non-Negotiable Long Form Promissory Note is not required.\n\nPromissory notes are a common financial instrument in many jurisdictions, employed principally for short time financing of companies. Often, the seller or provider of a service is not paid upfront by the buyer (usually, another company), but within a period of time, the length of which has been agreed upon by both the seller and the buyer. The reasons for this may vary; historically, many companies used to balance their books and execute payments and debts at the end of each week or tax month; any product bought before that time would be paid only then. Depending on the jurisdiction, this deferred payment period can be regulated by law; in countries like France, Italy or Spain, it usually ranges between 30 and 90 days after the purchase.\n\nWhen a company engages in many of such transactions, for instance by having provided services to many customers all of whom then deferred their payment, it is possible that the company may be owed enough money that its own liquidity position (i.e., the amount of cash it holds) is hampered, and finds itself unable to honour their own debts, despite the fact that by the books, the company remains solvent. In those cases, the company has the option of asking the bank for a short-term loan, or using any other such short-term financial arrangements to avoid insolvency. However, in jurisdictions where promissory notes are commonplace, the company (called the \"payee\" or \"lender\") can ask one of its debtors (called the \"maker\", \"borrower\" or \"payor\") to \"accept\" a promissory note, whereby the maker signs a legally binding agreement to honour the amount established in the promissory note (usually, part or all its debt) within the agreed period of time. The lender can then take the promissory note to a financial institution (usually a bank, albeit this could also be a private person, or another company), that will exchange the promissory note for cash; usually, the promissory note is cashed in for the amount established in the promissory note, less a small discount.\n\nOnce the promissory note reaches its \"maturity date\", its current holder (the bank) can execute it over the emitter of the note (the debtor), who would have to pay the bank the amount \"promised\" in the note. If the maker fails to pay, however, the bank retains the right to go to the company that cashed the promissory note in, and demand payment. In the case of unsecured promissory notes, the lender accepts the promissory note based solely on the maker's ability to repay; if the maker fails to pay, the lender must honour the debt to the bank. In the case of a secured promissory note, the lender accepts the promissory note based on the maker's ability to repay, but the note is secured by a thing of value; if the maker fails to pay and the bank reclaims payment, the lender has the right to execute the security.\n\nThus, promissory notes can work as a form of private money. In the past, particularly during the 19th century, their widespread and unregulated use was a source of great risk for banks and private financiers, who would often face the insolvency of both debtors, or simply be scammed by both.\n\nRoman promissory notes may be the first ones as 2,000-year-old Roman promissory notes have been found in London.\n\nHistorically, promissory notes have acted as a form of privately issued currency. Flying cash or \"feiqian\" was a promissory note used during the Tang dynasty (618 – 907). Flying cash was regularly used by Chinese tea merchants, and could be exchanged for hard currency at provincial capitals. The Chinese concept of promissory notes was introduced by Marco Polo to Europe.\n\nAccording to tradition, in 1325 a promissory note was signed in Milan. However, according to a travelogue of a visit to Prague in 960 by Ibrahim ibn Yaqub, small pieces of cloth were used as a means of trade, with these cloths having a set exchange rate versus silver. Around 1150 the Knights Templar issued promissory notes to pilgrims, pilgrims deposited their valuables with a local Templar preceptory before embarking, received a document indicating the value of their deposit, then used that document upon arrival in the Holy Land to retrieve their funds in an amount of treasure of equal value.\n\nThere is evidence of promissory notes being issued in 1384 between Genoa and Barcelona, although the letters themselves are lost. The same happens for the ones issued in Valencia in 1371 by Bernat de Codinachs for Manuel d'Entença, a merchant from Huesca (then part of the Crown of Aragon), amounting a total of 100 florins. In all these cases, the promissory notes were used as a rudimentary system of paper money, for the amounts issued could not be easily transported in metal coins between the cities involved. Ginaldo Giovanni Battista Strozzi issued an early form of promissory note in Medina del Campo (Spain), against the city of Besançon in 1553. However, there exists notice of promissory notes being in used in Mediterranean commerce well before that date.\n\nIn 1930, under the League of Nations, a \"Convention providing a uniform law for bills of exchange and promissory notes\" was drafted and ratified by eighteen nations. Article 75 of the treaty stated that a promissory note shall contain:\n\nIn the United States, a promissory note that meets certain conditions is a negotiable instrument regulated by article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Negotiable promissory notes called mortgage notes are used extensively in combination with mortgages in the financing of real estate transactions. One prominent example is the Fannie Mae model standard form contract Multistate Fixed-Rate Note 3200, which is publicly available. Promissory notes, or commercial papers, are also issued to provide capital to businesses. However, Promissory Notes act as a source of Finance to the company's creditors.\n\nThe various State law enactments of the Uniform Commercial Code define what is and what is not a promissory note, in section 3-104(d):\n\nThus, a writing containing such a disclaimer removes such a writing from the definition of \"negotiable instrument\", instead simply memorializing a contract.\n"}

Byrd Honors Scholarship Program was a federally funded and state-administered merit-based scholarship program in the United States.\n\nIt was designed to recognize exceptionally able high school seniors who showed promise of continued excellence in postsecondary education. The United States Department of Education's Office of Postsecondary Education awarded funds to state education agencies, which awarded scholarships (also known as Byrd Honors Scholarships) to eligible applicants. Students received scholarship funds which were to go towards college expenses.\n\nThe Byrd Honors Scholarships were established in 1985, providing $1,500 nonrenewable scholarships to eligible students. In 1993, the program was expanded to allow students who successfully completed their first year of college to reapply for stipends for the following three years. This brought the scholarship to its final value of $6,000 over four years. To pay for the over 27,000 scholars supported by the program, appropriations for the program were nearly $40,000,000 annually.\n\nFunding for the scholarship was eliminated for the 2011-2012 school year. As a result, new awards are not being given for that year, and payments for returning students will not be distributed.\n\nEach state set the criteria for awarding the Byrd Honors Scholarships in addition to federal requirements.

He is the suspected mastermind of a massive accounting fraud that ultimately cost the company its independence. Currently, the United States Government considers him a fugitive, with the United States Postal Inspection Service offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to his arrest and conviction.\n\nBorn in Split, Croatia, Razmilovic studied electrical engineering at the University of Zagreb and management at the Hammond Institute in Sweden. He obtained Swedish citizenship in 1971.\n\nRazmilovic joined Symbol in 1989 as Senior Vice President of International Operations, becoming head of Worldwide Sales and Service in 1993 and president and chief operating officer in 1995. He succeeded founder Jerome Swartz as CEO in 2000. Previously, he had been president of International Computers Limited, a British computer manufacturer, and president and CEO of Cominvest, a Swedish computer company. He abruptly retired in 2002 in the midst of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into its accounting practices.\n\nOn May 28, 2004, an arrest warrant for Razmilovic was issued by the United States District Court in Brooklyn. According to the United States Postal Inspection Service, he is wanted for orchestrating a massive accounting fraud that cost investors more than $200 million. He was formally indicted on June 3, along with seven other former Symbol executives. According to investigators, Razmilovic was the mastermind behind a wide-ranging scheme to inflate the company's sales and profits. It included several types of fraud, such as channel stuffing (booking sales to wholesalers and distributors as final sales to customers), candy deals (selling products to distributors with no matching customer orders and then buying the products back), use of tango sheets (records of how much revenues had to be inflated to match quarterly targets) and use of cookie jar reserves (declaring nonrecurring expenses that far exceeded likely expenses). On the same day, Razmilovic and 10 other executives were sued by the SEC for the fraud. Eventually, four executives pleaded guilty, and seven executives settled SEC charges against them. Several of those who pleaded guilty stated under oath that Razmilovic was the mastermind of the fraud. After the fraud came to light, it was revealed that Razmilovic had been forced out at Cominvest due to accounting irregularities. \n\nSymbol learned of the fraud in the summer of 2002 via an internal investigation, and cooperated with authorities. In late 2002, it restated almost four years worth of earnings from 1998 to 2001, in the process erasing $234 million in revenue and $325 million in net income. It also paid $37 million to settle the SEC charges and $138 million to settle numerous shareholder suits. The company never recovered, and was ultimately forced to merge with Motorola in 2007.\n\nRazmilovic was not heard from again until 2004, when WNBC in New York City and Newsday, the main newspaper on Long Island, found him living in a small town in Sweden. He had fled there citing claims that he would not be able to get a fair trial in the United States. In 2008, \"Forbes\" magazine named Razmilovic one of the \"World's Most Wanted White-Collar Fugitives\". \n\nThe SEC won a default judgement against Razmilovic in 2009. In 2011, federal judge Sandra J. Feuerstein ordered Razmilovic to disgorge $41.7 million in illegal profits and pay a $20.8 million civil penalty. With interest, the penalty could add up to as much as $47 million. He is also banned from ever serving as an officer or director of a public company again. On January 17, 2014, federal prosecutors on Long Island filed a civil suit seeking the forfeiture of $12 million in illegal profits that they believe Razmilovic has hidden in a Credit Suisse account.\n\nRazmilovic maintains that he is innocent, and in a 2013 interview with WNBC and CNBC went as far as to demand an apology from investigators and media covering the story. He has stated that he has no intention of returning to the United States to face the charges against him. Sweden will not give up Razmilovic for extradition because it does not turn over suspected white-collar criminals to a country not located in the European Union.\n\nThe accounting fraud was profiled by CNBC's \"American Greed: The Fugitives\" in 2013.\n"}

The son of an Aberdeen merchant, he began work as a coppersmith and won a government contract to sheath ships' hulls in copper. With the fortune he made (equivalent to over $1 billion in today's terms), he purchased the estates of Callendar and Linlithgow near Falkirk, which had been forfeited by the Jacobite Earl of Linlithgow after the 1715 Jacobite rising. He bought the estates at auction and is said to have astounded bystanders by producing a banknote for £100,000, specially printed for the occasion, at the age of just 40. At the time he was the greatest landowner in the county, with some of the largest collected lands in Scotland. He was not popular with local people, but nevertheless his family retained great influence over the area for two centuries.\n\nWishing to set himself up as a 'landed gentleman', William purchased further vast estates in Ayrshire, Earlstoun, Kirkcudbrightshire and Dumfriesshire. He spent ten years making improvements to Callendar House, dividing his time between the house and London. He gave orders for the complete renovation and refurnishing of the entire house, adding a new wing and ripping out old rooms. He added the various turrets and exterior decoration which give the house its chateau-like appearance today. Although William preferred the newest fashion (and purchased the best furniture and household goods from makers in London and Edinburgh) he did not spend money recklessly, ordering the new servants' wing to be furnished 'in the cheapest way'.\n\nHis first wife was Margaret McAdam, daughter of John McAdam of Craigengillan. She did not keep well and was sent to Madeira for her health's sake. There she died, at the early age of 28, in March 1793. Her gravestone, English marble, sent from London, can be seen in the English Cemetery, Funchal. Forbes remarried in 1806 Agnes Chalmers, daughter of John Chalmers of Old Machar in Aberdeen. This union produced two sons and three daughters. The Forbes household settled down after William's marriage and he began to spend more time in Callendar House and give his brother David greater control of the business in London.\n\nIn 1794, aged 51, he retired to become a full-time landowner, rejecting the idea of employing a factor trained in the needs of estate management and elected to manage the estates himself. His first son William, 2nd of Callendar, went on to become Conservative MP for Stirlingshire.\n\nForbes' descendants sold Callendar House in the 1960s and are listed in \"Burke's Landed Gentry\".\n\n"}
