He served as the director of the Iranian Archeological Service for many years.\n\nGodard was born in Chaumont. A graduate of the École des Beaux-Arts of Paris, he studied Middle Eastern archaeology, particularly that of Iran, and later became known for designing the National Museum of Iran, where he was appointed inaugural director in 1936. He was also instrumental in the design of Tehran University campus.\n\nHe made his first trip to the Middle East in 1910 with Henri Violle. Together, they began to excavate the ancient ruins of Samarra, located in modern-day Iraq. The ruins were fully excavated a few years later by German-born archaeologist Ernst Herzfeld. Godard returned to his architectural studies in 1912, focusing on Islamic architecture of Egypt.\n\nAfter World War I, Godard married Yeda Reuilly. The Delegation of French Archaeology in Afghanistan was subsequently founded in 1922, so Godard and his new wife accompanied the organization to not-yet-excavated regions. They consequently studied Bâmiyân, which was later permitted to be exhibited at the central Buddhist shrine of the Guimet Museum, in 1925.\n\nIn 1928, Godard was granted the directorship of Iranian Archeological Services, by the authority of Reza Shah. The IAS was intended to mark the end of French monopoly over excavation in Iran. As such, Godard focused on the politics of conservation, and held the title of Director from 1928-1953, then again from 1956-1960. Reza Shah also appointed him director of the National Museum of Iran (Muze-ye Irân-e Bāstān).\n\nDuring his tenure, Godard was responsible for the restoration of major historic monuments of Iran, such as the Friday Mosque, the Shah Mosque, and Mosque of Sheikh Lutfallah of Isfahan among others. Using his directorships, he organized large excavations of bronzes of Luristan, Persepolis and Isfahan. He was also instrumental, together with fellow architect Maxime Siroux, in the design of the National Library of Iran, Tomb of Hafez, and Central Pardis, the main campus of the University of Tehran.\n\nDuring World War II Godard opposed the Vichy government of France and when the Vichy diplomatic representatives were expelled from Tehran in 1942, helped form the Free France Committee and later become the official diplomatic representative of the provisional government in Tehran. In this period his wife Yedda organized an information radio program on Free France which was broadcast on the Persian radio.\n\nGodard returned to Paris in 1960, where he continued to write on Iranian art. He died in Paris on 31 July 1965.\n"}

It includes many artifacts for daily use and ritual practices, following a traditional iconography that is unique to their culture, but shows variations from island to island. Such art pieces are known as Bidyogo art and their unique aesthetics make Bidyogo art distinctive from all other African tribal art with the exception of the nearby Baga people who share some of the iconography (and are considered a \"related tribe\" by Bacquart).\"\n\nAmong the most striking Bidyogo art pieces are the portable ancestor shrines (\"iran\") that can either be realistic or abstract.\n\nZoomorphic masks representing cows (\"vaca-bruta\"), sharks, stingrays and, occasionally, other local animals are worn in adult initiation rituals (\"fanado\") mostly by boys, but occasionally by women.\n\nTraditionally-decorated artifacts are also produced for \"fanado\" coming-of-age ceremonies (wood masks, spears, shields, headgear, bracelets), Girls are also given stylized dolls to learn about child-caring.\n\nThe Bissagos produce unique objects for daily activities (fishing, agriculture) and personal use (stools, basketry, foodware) and boats.\n\nThough most Bidyogo hut dwellings show no remarkable artistry, so have their walls painted in bright colors with traditional symbols and patterns; occasionally doors are also painted with human or animal figures.\n\nSome of the village artists carve for ritual use as well as for the tourist trade, which can thus enable visitors to acquire etnographically interesting pieces.\n"}

As a young man, he was trained in the craft of leather working, and was taught how to sew leather jackets decorated with floral and geometric borders. Due to poor health, he gave up working with leather in 1945 and moved to Belgrade, where he found a job as a door attendant. He created his first sculpture in 1957, and held his first independent exhibition in 1960. He was soon recognized globally as an important leader in naïve and marginal art. His work is often categorized as Art Brut, and has been the central subject of exhibitions in major museums in Europe, as well as in North America and South America. He died in Belgrade in 2005.\n\nMuch of Živković's work was inspired by a seminal dream. In his dream, he saw a large serpent moving swiftly across a meadow, leaving a slimy track behind. With its tail, the serpent caught a stranger dressed in a monk's cowl and robe. The intensity of the dream led Živković to carve his visions in wood in order to gain a sense of release from his nightmare. To express himself, Živković used the natural shape of the trunk with or without branches, then smaller and thinner parts of branches, even ivy roots. Natural protuberances and hollows, various gnarls, and the mere mass of the matter inspired the artist to create the most diverse forms.\n\nHis chisel followed the natural configuration of the wood, thus liberating, cutting, trimming and shaping anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures, and less frequently animal or architectural shapes. He mostly carved in relief, which he used to cover his monumental columns.\n\nOto Bihalji-Merin, Michel Thevos, Roger Cardinal, and others wrote about his work.\n\nA great number of his monumental sculptures are in galleries and museums. Some, such as \"My Home\" and \"Dreams and Thought\", are in the collection of the Museum of Naïve and Marginal Art (MNMA), in Jagodina. The \"Magic Garden\", in his native village, is a temple of his art with many sculptures – in stone and wood, reliefs of carved objects, coloured accessory edifices, etc. – which bears best witness to his work.\n\nŽivković had a number of independent and group exhibitions worldwide. He has had solo exhibitions in Belgrade, Vienna, Paris, Warsaw, Stockholm, Munich and Amsterdam. Among his awards are Grand Prix at the Second Biennial of Yugoslav Naïve Art in 1983 and Award for Entire Artistic Work in 1991, MNMA, Jagodina, Serbia.\n\n\n"}

In 2012, British theatre critic Michael Billington claimed that “modern theatre\" is heavily dependent \"on Jewish writers.”\nA significant proportion of British theatre artists, such as Harold Pinter, Tom Stoppard, Peter Brook, Mike Leigh, Steven Berkoff, Patrick Marber, Nicholas Hytner, Sam Mendes, Jonathan Miller, Ryan Craig, Julia Pascal, Nina Raine, Diane Samuels, Shellley Silas or Gail Louw (see the List of British Jewish entertainers), are of Jewish cultural heritage, and thus ‘differently’ cultured. As Peter Lawson argues, Israel Zangwill's dramatization of his novel \"Children of the Ghetto\" (1899) is the first notable British-Jewish play, focused on immigration to the East End. The idea that there is a British-Jewish theatre emphasises the specific historical, ideological and institutional contexts and frameworks shaping Jewish-inflected theatre artists in Britain. Many of the Anglo-Jewish theatre or British-Jewish practitioners grew up in specifically Jewish environments (e.g.: Pinter, Kops, Wesker, Berkoff) to parents who were immigrants or first-generation British citizens. In these homes, Yiddish was often spoken and Hebrew read, different foods were cooked, different body languages seen, and the patterns of speech (often found in Pinter, Kops or Berkoff) were not quite British. British-Jewish theatre is shaped by specific historical, ideological and institutional contexts and frameworks, such as the role of still prevalent stereotypes and low-level anti-Semitism or the controversies around the Israeli-Palestine conflict. \n"}

It is derived from the fact that this artist was the first to cut sculptures from limestone rather than sandstone on a systematic basis on Gotland.\n\nTo the workshop of Calcarius around 20 baptismal fonts are attributed in the Baltic region. Only two of them are on Gotland (in Fole and Buttle Church), indicating that the workshop worked on an export market. The rest can be found in Ångermanland (Nora and Selånger Church), Medelpad (Stöde Church), Hälsingland (Njutånger Church), Uppland (Vidbo and Lunda Church), Östergötland (Gistad Church), Scania (Borrby Church), Öland (Bredsättra, Runsten and Ventlinge Church) and Bohuslän (Tossene Church) (all in Sweden), as well as in churches in Vestfold in present-day Norway, Falster in present-day Denmark and Schleswig-Holstein in present-day Germany.

The casket is 4 5/8 inches high, 9 15/16 inches wide and 5 1/16 inches deep (11.8 × 25.2 × 12.9 cm).\n\nThe casket is one of the relatively few surviving Gothic ivory caskets decorated with a variety of themes from courtly literature, called composite caskets for that reason. There are at least eight known surviving examples (and numerous fragments), of which two more are also discussed in this article: firstly a casket in the British Museum with an almost identical set of scenes, and one in the Cluny Museum in Paris, which shares many scenes, but diverges in others.\n\nBy this period, Paris was the main European centre of ivory carving, producing large numbers of religious and secular objects, including small diptychs with religious scenes that used the same relief technique; these and smaller secular objects such as mirror-cases are more common than these caskets, or larger religious statues like the \"Virgin and Child from the Sainte-Chapelle\" of the 1260s. The composite caskets differ slightly from each other, but are sufficiently similar to suggest they all originated from one Paris workshop, or group of workshops, around 1330 to 1350.\n\nThis casket may well have been a gift of courtship or upon marriage, and was probably intended for an aristocratic female owner, to keep her jewels and other valuables in. The carved scenes were possibly originally painted; as the paint on Gothic ivories tended to peel in places, it was very often removed by later dealers and collectors. The unusually large size of the piece allows a wide range of the repertoire of popular scenes from different literary sources in French Gothic art to be shown, which display a variety of medieval attitudes to love and the role of women: \"Themes such as lust and chastity, folly and wisdom are juxtaposed in a series of non-connected scenes\". Susan L. Smith has proposed that composite caskets express the power of love. The Walters casket is first recorded in England in 1757, and was bought by Henry Walters in 1923. The iron mounts are modern, probably 19th century.\n\nThe lid shows scenes of the Castle of love and knights jousting and the sides show other scenes from French medieval romances. The themes of the lid are related to the 13th-century \"Romance of the Rose\" by Guillaume de Lorris and Jean de Meung. The \"Siege of the Castle of Love\" (or \"Assault on\" etc.), at the left on the lid, is a fanciful scene of courtly romance, where knights attack a castle defended by ladies and a cupid, with both sides throwing roses as missiles. This subject does not, as is sometimes claimed, appear in the \"Roman de la Rose\", and first appears in art not long before the date of the casket, as one of few secular scenes in the illuminated manuscript known as the Peterborough Psalter of 1299–1328. But such a scene was staged and acted out by \"many gentlemen and twelve of the fairest and gayest ladies of Padua\" as part of a festival at Treviso in 1214, a century earlier. In the center knights joust in front of ladies.\n\nThe scene at right has differing interpretations: either the victor, whose shield carried three roses, receives a bouquet of roses from a lady as prize, or, more likely, the tournament continues, now between the ladies, fighting with flowers, and the knights using \"oak branches\". This is the only scene on the lid that differs in the British Museum and Paris caskets, where the siege of the castle continues in the section at furthest right. A variation of this set of scenes has examples in the Cleveland Museum of Art, Detroit Institute of Arts, Château de Boulogne-sur-Mer, Walker Art Gallery and the Metropolitan Museum of Art: in the latter (17.190.173) there is an elopement scene at left, then the two central sections are the tournament, with the attack on the Castle of Love behind the elopement at left, and in the last section on the right.\n\nThe front of the casket has, from the left: Aristotle teaching Alexander the Great, Phyllis riding Aristotle, watched by Alexander from a window, and at the right, old people arriving at the Fountain of Youth, and young naked people in it. \"Phyllis riding Aristotle\" is the \"quintessential image from the Power of Women topos\", which was beginning its long career in art at this time. The Fountain of Youth is a regularly occurring scene, of Eastern origin, that shows old people being carried to a miraculous spring which immediately turns them into beautiful young people, one of the relatively few scenes in medieval art where figures are not just \"naked\" but \"nude\". All three scenes are the same in the British Museum casket, and the Walters also has a side from a French casket of similar date but less high-quality carving, showing the first two of these scenes, but changing the last (Walters 71196, shown below). The Walters also has mirror-cases with other examples of the \"Siege of the Castle of Love\" and the \"Fountain of Youth\".\nThe rear side of the casket contains scenes from Arthurian romance described in the Courtauld Institute database of Gothic ivories as: \"Gawain in armour fighting the lion; Lancelot crossing the sword bridge, with spears falling from the sky; Gawain on the perilous bed; bed on wheels and with bells; lion; shield with a lion's paw; spears falling from the sky; the three maidens at the Château Merveil\". The sword bridge features in \"Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart\" by Chrétien de Troyes, and the perilous bed in his \"Perceval, the Story of the Grail\". Both the Walters and British Museum caskets have the same scenes and compositions here, which both depart from the literary sources by having the rain of swords falling not only on Gawain on the bed, but also on Lancelot on the bridge, suggesting that the ivory-carver's or designer's contact with the literature was indirect.\n\nThe two ends show other Arthurian scenes: the adulterous lovers Tristan and Iseult are spied upon by Iseult's husband King Mark of Cornwall, hiding in a tree; his face can be seen reflected in the pool below, which they see, enabling them to switch to innocent conversation. This end also has a scene with a wounded unicorn, a maiden and a man with holding a spear which has been run through the unicorn, in a version of the subject of \"The Hunt of the Unicorn\" where the maiden has been used to lure the unicorn to his death. The other end has a scene with Galahad.\n\nThe Courtauld Institute maintains a database of over 5,000 Gothic ivories. The database catalogues the surviving composite caskets and the known fragments as follows:\n\n\nIn addition there are fragments from a dismantled casket, known from an 18th-century engraving, whose locations are unknown, save the back panel which is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (2003.131.2):\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37389994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37389994", "title": "Clandestine literature", "text": "Clandestine literature\n\nClandestine literature, also called \"underground literature\", refers to a type of editorial and publishing process that involves self-publishing works, often in contradiction with the legal standards of a location. Clandestine literature is often an attempt to circumvent censorship, prosecution, or other suppression. In academic study, such literature may be referred to as heterodox publications (as opposed to officially sanctioned, orthodox publishing).\n\nExamples of clandestine literature include the Samizdat literature of Soviet dissidents; the Aljamiado literature of Al-Andalus Spain; and the nushu writing of some upper-class women in Hunan, China, from around the 10th century to the 19th century. Clandestine publications were plentiful during the Enlightenment era in 18th-century France, circulating as pamphlets or manuscripts, usually containing texts that would have been considered highly blasphemous by the Ancien Régime, or even straight out atheist. These clandestine manuscripts particularly flourished in the 1720s, and contained such controversial works as \"Treatise of the Three Impostors\" and the reverend Jean Mesliers \"Atheistic Testament\". Both texts were later published in edited versions by Voltaire, but handwritten manuscript copies have been found in private libraries all over Europe. The clandestine literature of 18th century France also consisted of printed works produced in neighbouring Switzerland or the Netherlands and smuggled into France. These books were usually termed \"philosophical works\", but varied greatly in content from pornography, utopian novels, political slander and actual philosophical works by radical enlightenment philosophers like Baron d'Holbach, Julien Offray de La Mettrie and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.\n\nThe willingness to break the law may be due to ideological reasons, when works are contrary to government positions or pose a threat to the institutions in power, but also for reasons at a formal level, when publications do not comply with legal regulations imposed for the circulation of printed works. Underground literature is a type of clandestine literature that does not necessarily have the evasion of the censorship of the time as its purpose; the goal of its writers may only be to lower publishing costs, often being funded by the authors themselves.\n\nWorks that are originally published by clandestine means may eventually become established as canonical literature, such as \"Das Kapital\" and \"El Buscón\".\n\nA legitimate publisher in one jurisdiction may assist writers from elsewhere to circumvent their own laws by enabling them to publish abroad. The Olympia Press in Paris published several 20th-century English-language writers, including Henry Miller, who were facing censorship and possible prosecution in their own country at the time.\n\n"}
{"id": "308550", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=308550", "title": "Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs", "text": "Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs\n\nCoal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs (working title: So White and de Sebben Dwarfs) is a \"Merrie Melodies\" animated cartoon directed by Bob Clampett, produced by Leon Schlesinger Productions, and released to theatres on January 16, 1943 by Warner Bros. and The Vitaphone Corporation.\n\nThe film is an all-black parody of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale \"Snow White\", known to its audience from the popular 1937 Walt Disney animated feature \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\". The stylistic portrayal of the characters is an example of \"darky\" iconography, which was widely accepted in American society at the time. As such, it is one of the most controversial cartoons in the classic Warner Brothers library, being one of the Censored Eleven. The cartoon has been rarely seen on television, and has never been officially released on home video.\n\nIn this version of the story, all of the characters are black, and speak all of their dialogue in rhyme. The story is set during World War II in the United States, and the original tale's fairy tale wholesomeness is replaced in this film by a hot jazz mentality and sexual overtones. Several scenes unique to Disney's film version of \"Snow White\", such as the wishing-well sequence, the forest full of staring eyes, and the awakening kiss, are directly parodied in this film. The film was intended to have been named \"So White and de Sebben Dwarfs\", which producer Leon Schlesinger thought was too close to the original film's actual title, and had changed to \"Coal Black and De Sebben Dwarfs\".\n\nClampett intended \"Coal Black\" as both a parody of \"Snow White\" and a dedication to the all-black jazz musical films popular in the early 1940s (i.e. \"Cabin in the Sky\", \"Stormy Weather\", etc.). In fact, the idea to produce \"Coal Black\" came to Clampett after he saw Duke Ellington's 1941 musical revue \"Jump for Joy\", and Ellington and the cast suggested Clampett make a black musical cartoon. The Clampett unit made a couple of field trips to Club Alabam, a Los Angeles area black club, to get a feel for the music and the dancing, and Clampett cast popular radio actors as the voices of his three main characters. The main character, So White, is voiced by Vivian Dandridge, sister of actress Dorothy Dandridge. Their mother, Ruby Dandridge, voices the Wicked Queen (or rather her sweet voice and evil cackle, while for the majority of the cartoon, the Queen's true voice, which is low and raspy, is played by Danny Webb). Leo Watson is the voice of \"Prince Chawmin'\". The other characters, including the Sebben Dwarfs, are voiced by standard Warner Bros. voice artist Mel Blanc.\n\nOriginally, Clampett wanted an all-black band to score the cartoon, the same way Max and Dave Fleischer had Cab Calloway and His Orchestra score the \"Betty Boop\" cartoons \"Minnie the Moocher\", \"The Old Man of the Mountain\", and their own version of \"Snow White\". However, Schlesinger refused, and the black band Clampett had hired, Eddie Beals and His Orchestra, only recorded the music for the final kiss sequence. The rest of the film was scored, as was standard for Warner Bros. cartoons, by Carl W. Stalling.\n\n\"Coal Black\" opens in front of a fireplace with a red-tinted silhouette of a large woman holding a young child in her lap. The little black girl asks her \"mammy\" to tell her the story of \"So White an' de Sebben Dwarfs\". \"Mammy\" begins:\n\nWell, once there was a \"mean\" ol' queen. And she lived in a gorgeous castle. And was that ole' gal rich! She was just as rich as she was mean! She had \"everythang!\"\n\nThe rich, Wicked Queen then appears, depicted as a \"food hoarder\", with a large repository of items that were on ration during World War II: rubber, sugar, gin (\"Eli Whitney's Cotton Gin\" brand) and more. After stuffing her face with candies (from a box marked \"Chattanooga Chew-Chews\"), she asks her magic mirror to \"send her a prince 'bout six feet tall\", (2 metres) but when Prince Chawmin' arrives in his flashy car, he declares \"that mean ol' queen sho' is a fright / but her gal So White is dyn-a-mite!\" Finding So White hard at work doing the laundry, the prince takes her hand and the two swing out into a wild jitterbug. The queen sees this and hires \"Murder, Incorporated\" to \"black-out So White.\" The assassins arrive in a panel truck that advertises, \"We rub out anybody for $1.00; Midgets: 1/2-price; Japs: free\". (US$1 would be equal to US$ in .)\n\nThe assassins kidnap the girl, but after several unseen \"favors\" which make the would-be assassins very happy, set her free in the woods unharmed. Just before they drive off, the assassins are seen covered with So White's lipstick, an innuendo as to exactly how she earned her freedom. Wandering through the woods by herself, So White runs into the Sebben Dwarfs, seven diminutive army men in uniform who sing \"We're in the Army Now,\" with two dwarfs singing \"it takes us cats ... to catch them rats\" at the end, and So White declares in a 1940s swing-style singing voice, \"I'm wacky over khaki now!\" They immediately recruit her as their squad cook, and she spends her days \"fryin' up eggs an' pork chops too\" (to the tune of \"Five O'Clock Whistle\") for the hungry soldiers, as a sign which hangs from her outdoor antique stove reads, \"Keep 'em frying,\" as a sendup of the World War II slogan, \"Keep 'Em Flying.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the queen has learned that So White is still alive, and pumps an apple full of poison to give to the girl and kill her. Several worms escape the apple as the queen injects it with poison, one carrying a sign that says \"Refoogies.\" The queen disguises herself as an old peddler woman, and arrives at the Sebben Dwarfs' camp and gives So White the poisoned apple. One of the seven dwarfs (modeled on the \"Dopey\" dwarf in Disney's film) alerts the others that the queen has caused So White to \"kick the bucket,\" and the entire squad hops into its vehicles (a Jeep, a \"Beep,\" and, for \"Dopey,\" a \"Peep\"). As the queen makes her escape over the hills, the dwarfs load a cannon with both a war shell and \"Dopey.\" The shell sails over to the queen, stops in front of her in mid-air, opens, and \"Dopey\" appears, knocking the crone out with a mallet.\n\nEven though the queen has been defeated, So White is still dead to the world. The dwarfs note, in spoken rhyme:\n\n<poem>\nShe's outta this world! She's stiff as wood!\nShe's got it bad, and that ain't good!\nThere's only one thing that'll remedy this\nand dat's Prince Chawmin' and his Dynamite Kiss!\n</poem>\n\nUpon the dwarfs' invoking his name, the prince jumps into the scene in a spotlight and promises to \"give her a kiss / and it won't be a dud / I'll bring her to life with my special 'Rosebud'\", a nod to \"Citizen Kane\". Wiping his lip and leaning over the girl in preparation, Prince Chawmin' proceeds to give So White a succession of highly aerobic kisses, practically swallowing the girl's face whole in trying to awaken her, but without any luck. Prince Chawmin' keeps frantically kissing So White (his efforts underscored by a solo from Eddie Beale's trumpet player), and the efforts literally take the life out of him as he first turns blue in the face, before turning into a withered old, pale-faced man, shrugging his shoulders in defeat. The \"Dopey\" dwarf then saunters over to So White, and, to the tune of \"You're in the Army Now,\" lays a kiss on the girl so dynamic that not only does So White wake up, but her eyes become large as saucers and her pigtails fly straight up into the air (depicted in Rod Scribner's typically extreme animation style) as she jumps into the air.\n\nThe worn-out and aged Prince asks \"Dopey,\" \"Man, what you got that makes So White think \"you\" so hot?!\" \"Dopey\" replies, with the only non-rhyming line in the cartoon, \"well, dat is a military secret,\" and lays another kiss on So White, which sends her pigtails sailing into the air again and causes the red ribbons on them to turn into twin American flags, to several notes of \"The Stars and Stripes Forever\", and immediately after the kiss, So White and \"Dopey\" both show an obvious \"afterglow\" in their eyes and their smile. The film then fades to the standard \"Merrie Melodies\" \"That's all, Folks!\" end title text, superimposed over a shot of the little girl and her \"mammy\" from the opening scene.\n\nIn April, 1943, the NAACP protested the caricatures which appeared in \"Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs\".\n\n\"Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs\" is notorious for being one of the \"Censored Eleven\": 11 Schlesinger/Warner Bros. cartoons produced at the height of the based on its unflattering and stereotypical use of darky iconography. Because it was produced in America during World War II, there is also anti-Japanese sentiment: the firm \"Murder Inc.\" advertises that it does not charge to kill \"Japs\".\n\nThe same basic stereotypical elements present in the earlier Censored Eleven films are also present in \"Coal Black\", depicted with more detail and made to conform to Clampett's \"wacky\" directorial style. The Prince, a vague Cab Calloway lookalike, is depicted as a slender, zoot suited Black man with straightened hair, a monocle, and gold teeth (with dice in place of the front two incisors). Both he and the dwarfs are drawn with large eyes, small noses, and unnaturally large pink lips, derived from the appearance of a white man in blackface rather than that of an actual black man. The middle-aged wicked Queen is depicted as an overweight, asexual crone, with large lips that are only partially covered with lipstick (the Queen's lipstick only extends as far as it would if her lips were proportionate to her face).\n\nOnly So White escapes the extreme caricature given the other characters, although she is stereotyped in a different manner. She is designed as an attractive young woman with a voluptuous figure revealed by a short skirt and a low-cut, cleavage-revealing blouse. The sexualization of So White recalls Walter Lantz's 1941 cartoon \"Scrub Me Mama with a Boogie Beat\", where a young light-skinned Black woman is depicted as attractive while the other Black characters are drawn as extreme caricatures. In both that film and \"Coal Black\", the sexually attractive features of the young women are significant plot devices. In \"Coal Black\", So White is the object of sexual desire for every male character in the picture. This draws upon the stereotype of the young attractive black woman as an \"exotic\" sexual being, a stereotype present in roles that African-American actresses such as Dorothy Dandridge and Lena Horne played in American cinema.\n\nClampett would revisit black jazz culture again in another 1943 Merrie Melodies cartoon, \"Tin Pan Alley Cats\", which features a feline caricature of Fats Waller in a repurposing of the wacky fantasy world from \"Porky in Wackyland\" (during the opening sequence, the \"Fats\" cat is distracted by what appears to be So White). Clampett's colleague Friz Freleng directed a cartoon titled \"Goldilocks and the Jivin' Bears\" in 1944, essentially \"Coal Black\" remade with a different fairy tale, and Warner's director Chuck Jones directed a series of shorts starring a prepubescent African hunter named Inki from 1939 to 1950. Like \"Coal Black\", \"Tin Pan Alley Cats\" and \"Goldilocks and the Jivin' Bears\" would also end up in the Censored Eleven.\n\nBob Clampett claimed in the cartoon's defense that;\n\nThe racially stereotyped portrayals of African-Americans in \"Coal Black\" and the other \"Censored Eleven\" cartoons led to their being suppressed from television broadcast. In 1968, United Artists, which then owned the rights to the pre-August 1948 Warner Bros. cartoon library, officially banned the cartoons from circulation, and they have not been officially broadcast or released on home video since - even as the rights returned to Warners.\n\n\"Coal Black and De Sebben Dwarfs\" is often praised and defended by film scholars and animation historians, and has often been included on lists of the greatest animated films ever made. One such list, the subject of Jerry Beck's 1994 book \"The 50 Greatest Cartoons\", placed \"Coal Black\" at number 21, based upon votes from over 1000 members of the American animation industry. Scholarly animation texts including Michael Barrier's \"Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age\", name \"Coal Black\" as Clampett's undisputed masterpiece. Despite its being banned, \"Coal Black\" is a popular draw at film festivals and small-audience screenings, and is often bootlegged for release on home video.\n\nIt was seen briefly in the 1989 Turner Entertainment VHS release \"Cartoons For Big Kids\", hosted by Leonard Maltin, and in the \"Behind the Tunes\" featurette \"Once Upon a Looney Tune\", which is included in the \"\" DVD box set.\n\nOn April 24, 2010, \"Coal Black and De Sebben Dwarfs\", along with seven other titles from the Censored Eleven, was screened at the first annual Turner Classic Movies (TCM) Film Festival as part of a special presentation hosted by film historian Donald Bogle; the eight shorts shown were restored for that release.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Featuring a straightforward approach to representation practiced by artists such as Philip Pearlstein, Alex Katz, Jack Beal and Neil Welliver. The movement refers to figurative art works created in a natural yet highly objective style. Today the term Contemporary Realism encompasses all post-1970 sculptors and painters whose discipline is representational art, where the object is to portray the \"real\" and not the \"ideal\".\n\nSome Contemporary Realists, like Beal and Rackstraw Downes, began as trained abstract painters. (Abstract Expressionism had been well-established by c. 1960.) Rural artist enclaves (e.g., The Hamptons; areas of Maine) encouraged naturalistic imagery for some. Others shared approaches and methods of Photorealism. Some art schools, notably the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, have continued to nurture the legacy of 19th-century American Realist painting; Yale has seen a loose, inter-generational network of representational painters over the past few decades. The New York Academy of Art continues to further contemporary figurative art. A number of women artists have been prominently associated with stylistic variants of contemporary realism, including (not limited to) Jane Freilicher, Jane Wilson, Lois Dodd, Janet Fish, Catherine Murphy, Yvonne Jacquette and Martha Mayer Erlebacher. \n\n\"Real, Really Real, Super Real: Directions in Contemporary American Realism\" (San Antonio Museum Association, 1981; exhibition catalogue).\n\nMark Strand, Robert Hughes, Timothy-Greenfield Sanders, \"Art of the Real: Nine American Figurative Painters\" (New York: Clarkson N.

{"id": "25245841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25245841", "title": "Crucifixion in the arts", "text": "Crucifixion in the arts\n\nCrucifixions and crucifixes have appeared in the arts and popular culture from before the era of the pagan Roman Empire. The crucifixion of Jesus has been depicted in religious art since the 4th century CE. In more modern times, crucifixion has appeared in film and television as well as in fine art, and depictions of other historical crucifixions have appeared as well as the crucifixion of Christ. Modern art and culture have also seen the rise of images of crucifixion being used to make statements unconnected with Christian iconography, or even just used for shock value.\n\nThe earliest known artistic representations of crucifixion predate the Christian era, including Greek representations of mythical crucifixions inspired by the use of the punishment by the Persians.\n\nThe Alexamenos graffito, currently in the museum in the Palatine Hill, Rome, is a Roman graffito from the 2nd century CE which depicts a man worshiping a crucified donkey. This graffito, though apparently meant as an insult, is the earliest known pictorial representation of the crucifixion of Jesus. The text scrawled around the image reads Αλεξαμενος ϲεβετε θεον, which translates to \"Alexamenos worships God\" or some variant of this sentence.\n\nIn the first three centuries of Early Christian art, the crucifixion was rarely depicted. Some engraved gems thought to be 2nd or 3rd century have survived, but the subject does not appear in the art of the Catacombs of Rome, and it is thought that at this period the image was restricted to heretical groups of Christians. The earliest Western images clearly originating in the mainstream of the church are 5th-century, including the scene on the doors of Santa Sabina, Rome. Constantine I forbade crucifixion as a method of execution, and early church leaders regarded crucifixion with horror, and thus, as an unfit subject for artistic portrayal.\n\nThe purported discovery of the True Cross by Constantine's mother, Helena, and the development of Golgotha as a site for pilgrimage, together with the dispersal of fragments of the relic across the Christian world, led to a change of attitude. It was probably in Palestine that the image developed, and many of the earliest depictions are on the Monza ampullae, small metal flasks for holy oil, that were pilgrim's souvenirs from the Holy Land, as well as 5th-century ivory reliefs from Italy. Prior to the Middle Ages, early Christians preferred to focus on the \"triumphant\" Christ, rather than a dying one, because the concept of the risen Christ was so central to their faith. The plain cross became depicted, often as a \"glorified\" symbol, as the crux gemmata, covered with jewels, as many real early medieval processional crosses in goldsmith work were.\n\nEarly depictions showed a living Christ, and tended to minimize the appearance of suffering, so as to draw attention to the positive message of resurrection and faith, rather than to the physical realities of execution. In the early history of the church in Ireland, important events were often commemorated by erecting pillars with elaborate crucifixes carved into them, such as where Saint Patrick, returning as a missionary bishop, saw the place he was held captive in his youth.\n\nEarly Byzantine depictions such as that in the Rabbula Gospels often show Christ flanked by Longinus and Stephaton with their spear and pole with vinegar. According to the gospels, the vinegar was offered just before Christ died, and the lance used just after, so the presence of the two flanking figures symbolizes the \"double reality of God and man in Christ\". In images from after the end of the Byzantine Iconoclasm, Christ is shown as dead, but his \"body is undamaged and there is no expression of pain\"; the Eastern church held that Christ's body was invulnerable. The \"S\"-shaped slumped body type was developed in the 11th century. These images were one of the complaints against Constantinople given by Rome in the Great Schism of 1054, although the Gero Cross in Cologne is probably nearly a century older.\n\nThe earliest Western images of a dead Christ may be in the Utrecht Psalter, probably before 835. Other early Western examples include the Gero Cross and the reverse of the Cross of Lothair, both from the end of the 10th century. The first of these is the earliest near life-size sculpted cross to survive, and in its large scale represents \"suffering in its extreme physical consequences\", a trend that was to continue in the West. Such figures, especially as roods, large painted or sculpted crucifixes hung high in front of the chancel of churches, became very important in Western art, providing a sharp contrast with Eastern Orthodox traditions, where the subject was never depicted in monumental sculpture, and increasingly rarely even in small Byzantine ivories. By contrast, an altar cross, almost always a crucifix, became compulsory in Western churches in the Middle Ages, and small wall-mounted crucifixes were increasingly popular in Catholic homes from the Counter-Reformation, if not before.\n\nAs a broad generalization, the earliest depictions, before about 900, tended to show all three crosses (those of Jesus, the Good Thief and the Bad Thief), but later medieval depictions mostly showed just Jesus and his cross. From the Renaissance either type might be shown. The number of other figures shown depended on the size and medium of the work, but there was a similar trend for early depictions to show a number of figures, giving way in the High Middle Ages to just the Virgin Mary and Saint John the Evangelist, shown standing on either side of the cross, as in the Stabat Mater depictions, or sculpted or painted on panels at the end of each arm of a rood cross.\n\nThe soldiers were less likely to be shown, but others of the party with Mary and John might be. Angels were often shown in the sky, and the Hand of God in some early depictions gave way to a small figure of God the Father in the heavens in some later ones, those these were always in the minority. Other elements that might be included were the sun and moon (evoking the darkening of the heavens at the moment of Christ’s death), and Ecclesia and Synagoga. Although according to the Gospel accounts his clothing was removed from Jesus before his crucifixion, most artists have thought it proper to represent his lower body as draped in some way. In one type of sculpted crucifix, of which the Volto Santo in Lucca is the classic example, Christ continued to wear the long \"collobium\" robe of the Rabbula Gospels.\nIn the Gothic period more elaborate narrative depictions developed, including many extra figures of Mary Magdalene, disciples, especially The Three Marys behind the Virgin Mary, soldiers often including an officer on a horse, and angels in the sky. The moment when Longinus the centurion pierces Christ with his spear (the \"Holy Lance\") is often shown, and the blood and water spurting from Christ's side is often caught in a chalice held by an angel. In larger images the other two crosses might return, but most often not. In some works donor portraits were included in the scene. Such depictions begin in the late 12th century, and become common where space allows in the 13th century.\n\nRelated scenes such as the \"Deposition of Christ\", \"Entombment of Christ\" and \"Nailing of Christ to the Cross\" developed. In the Late Middle Ages, increasingly intense and realistic representations of suffering were shown, reflecting the development of highly emotional andachtsbilder subjects and devotional trends such as German mysticism; some, like the Throne of Mercy, Man of Sorrows and Pietà, related to the Crucifixion. The same trend affected the depiction of other figures, notably in the \"Swoon of the Virgin\", who is very commonly shown fainting in paintings of between 1300 and 1500, though this depiction was attacked by theologians in the 16th century, and became unusual. After typically more tranquil depictions during the Italian Renaissance—though not its Northern equivalent, which produced works such as the Isenheim Altarpiece—there was a return to intense emotionalism in the Baroque, in works such as Peter Paul Rubens's \"Elevation of the Cross\".\n\nThe scene always formed part of a cycle of images of the \"Life of Christ\" after about 600 (though it is noticeably absent before) and usually in one of the \"Life of the Virgin\"; the presence of Saint John made it a common subject for altarpieces in churches dedicated to him. From the late Middle Ages various new contexts for images were devised, from such large scale monuments as the \"calvaire\" of Brittany and the Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy to the thousands of small wayside shrines still found in many parts of Catholic Europe, and the Stations of the Cross in the majority of Catholic churches.\n\nCrucifixion has appeared repeatedly as a theme in many forms of modern art.\n\nThe surrealist Salvador Dalí painted \"Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)\", representing the cross as a hypercube. Fiona Macdonald describes the 1954 painting as showing a classical pose of Christ superimposed on a mathematical representation of the fourth dimension that is both unseeable and spiritual; Gary Bolyer assesses it as \"one of the most beautiful works of the modern era.\" The sculpture \"Construction (Crucifixion): Homage to Mondrian\", by Barbara Hepworth, stands on the grounds of Winchester Cathedral. Porfirio DiDonna's abstract \"Crucifixion\" is one of a number of religious works he painted in the 1960s, \"blending the artist's devotion to the liturgy and his commitment to painting\". The \"Welsh Window\", given to the 16th Street Baptist Church after it was bombed by four Ku Klux Klansmen in 1963, is a work of support and solidarity. The stained glass window depicts a black man, arms outstretched, reminiscent of the crucifixion of Jesus; it was sculpted by John Petts, who also initiated a campaign in Wales to raise money to help rebuild the church.\n\nPhotographer Robert Mapplethorpe's 1975 self-portrait shows the artist, nude and smiling, posed as if crucified. The 1983 painting \"Crucifixion\", by Nabil Kanso, employs a perspective that places the viewer behind Christ's cross. In 1987 photographer Andres Serrano created \"Piss Christ\", a controversial photograph that shows a small plastic crucifix submerged in a glass of the artist's urine, in which Serrano intended to depict sympathetically the abuse of Jesus by his executioners. In the 1990s, Marcus Reichert painted a series of crucifixions, though he did not identify the figure as Christ, but as a representation of human suffering.\n\nOther artists have used crucifixion imagery as a form of protest. In 1974, Chris Burden had himself crucified to a Volkswagen. Robert Cenedella painted a crucified Santa Claus as a protest against Christmas commercialization, displayed in the window of New York's Art Students League in December 1997. In August 2000, performance artist Sebastian Horsley had himself crucified without the use of any analgesics.\n\nCrucifixion in popular art, as with modern art, is sometimes used for its shock value. For example, a World War I Liberty bond poster by Fernando Amorsolo depicts a German soldier nailing an American soldier, his arms outspread, to the trunk of a tree. Crucifixion imagery is also used to make points in political cartoons.\n\nCrucifixion figures prominently in graphic novels from many cultures throughout the world. In Western comic books, characters in cruciform are seen more often than actual crucifixions. For example, \"Animal Man\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s fifth issue earned an Eisner Award nomination in 1989 for its \"The Coyote Gospel\", the story of Crafty, a thinly-disguised Wile E. Coyote (of the Road Runner cartoons) and the depiction at the culmination of the issue of his dead body in cruciform. Superman, often seen as a Christ figure, has also been crucified, as well as being shown in cruciform.\n\nCrucifixions and crucifixes have appeared repeatedly in Japanese manga and anime. In manga iconography, crucifixes serve two purposes: as death symbols, and as symbols of justice. Scholars such as Michael Broderick and Susan J. Napier argue that Japanese readers associate crucifixion imagery with apocalyptic themes, and trace this symbolism to Japanese secular views of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, rather than to religious faith. Producers of anime generally deny any religious motivation for depiction of crucifixion. Concern that Westerners may find these portrayals of crucifixion offensive has led some distributors and localization studios to remove crucifixion imagery from manga such as \"Fullmetal Alchemist\" and anime such as \"Sailor Moon\".\nPassion plays are dramatic presentations of the trial and crucifixion of Jesus. They originated as expressions of devotion in the Middle Ages. In modern times, critics have said that some performances are antisemitic.\n\nNumerous movies have been produced which depict the crucifixion of Jesus. Some of these movies depict the crucifixion in its traditional sectarian form, while others intend to show a more historically accurate account. For example, \"Ben-Hur\" (1959), was probably the first movie to depict the nails being driven through Jesus' wrists, rather than his palms. Mel Gibson's controversial \"The Passion of the Christ\" (2004) depicted an extreme level of violence, but showed the nails being driven into Jesus' palms, as is traditional, with ropes supporting the wrists.\n\nAlthough crucifixion imagery is common, few films depict actual crucifixion outside of a Christian context. \"Spartacus\" (1960) depicts the mass crucifixions of rebellious slaves along the Appian Way after the Third Servile War. The character Big Bob is crucified by cannibals in Wes Craven's horror exploitation film \"The Hills Have Eyes\" (1977) as well as its 2006 remake. \"Conan the Barbarian\" (1982) depicts the protagonist being crucified on the Tree of Woe.\n\nThe 1979 British comedy film \"Monty Python's Life of Brian\" ends with a comical sequence in which several of the cast, including Brian, are crucified by the Romans. The film ends with them all singing the song \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\". In this sequence, the characters are not nailed to the crosses, but tied at the wrists to the crossbar, and are standing on smaller crosspieces at foot level.\n\nIn the 2010 film \"Legion\", one of the diner patrons is found crucified upside down and covered with huge boils.\n\nSimulated crucifixions have been performed in professional wrestling. On the December 7, 1998, edition of \"WWF Monday Night Raw\", professional wrestling character The Undertaker crucified Steve Austin. On October 26, 1996, in Extreme Championship Wrestling, Raven, during a feud with The Sandman, instructed his Raven's Nest to crucify Sandman.\n\nOther television performers have used crucifixion to make a point. The Australian comedian John Safran had himself crucified in the Philippines as part of a Good Friday crucifixion ritual for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation show, \"John Safran's Race Relations\" (2009). Singer Robbie Williams performed a stunt on an April 2006 Easter Sunday show shown on the UK television channel Channel 4, in which he was affixed to a cross and pierced with needles.\n\nThe HBO television series \"Rome\" (2005–2007) contained several depictions of crucifixion, as it was a common torture method during the historical period the show takes place in.\n\nIn the 2010 \"Starz\" television series \"\", Segovax, a slave recruit to the gladiatorial ludus of Lentulus Batiatus, attempts to assassinate Spartacus in the ludus washrooms and is crucified for doing so \"after being parted from his cock\".\n\nCrucifixion has been depicted in the television series \"\" (1995–2001), where its depiction has been cited in feminist studies as illustrating violent and misogynist tendencies within a messianic paradigm.\n\nIn the History Channel series \"Vikings\", the character Æthelstan, after being captured by the Saxons and named an apostate, is shown wearing a crown of thorns and being nailed to a cross. After the cross is raised he is taken down at the order of King Ecbert.\n\nThe Japanese science fiction series Neon Genesis Evangelion features crucifixion as a recurring motif.\n\nFamous depictions of crucifixion in classical music include the \"St John Passion\" and \"St Matthew Passion\" by Johann Sebastian Bach, and Giovanni Battista Pergolesi's setting of \"Stabat Mater\". Notable recent settings include the \"St. Luke Passion\" (1965) by Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki and the \"St. John Passion\" (1982) by Estonian composer Arvo Pärt. The 2000 work, \"La Pasión según San Marcos\" (St. Mark Passion) by Argentinian Jewish composer Osvaldo Golijov, was named one of the top classical compositions of the decade for its fusion of traditional passion motifs with Afro-Cuban, tango, Capoeira, and Kaddish themes.\n\nCrucifixion has figured prominently in Easter cantatas, oratorios, and requiems. The third section of a full mass, the \"Credo\", contains the following passage at its climax: \"Crucifixus etiam pro nobis sub Pontio Pilato, passus et sepultus est,\" which means \"And was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; he suffered and was buried.\" This passage was sometimes set to music separately as a \"Crucifixus\", the most famous example being that of Antonio Lotti for eight voices.\n\nThe seven utterances of Jesus while on the Cross, gathered from the four gospels, have inspired many musical compositions, from Heinrich Schütz in 1645 to Ruth Zechlin in 1996, with the best known being Joseph Haydn's \"The Seven Last Words of Christ\", composed in 1787.\n\nDepictions of crucifixion outside the Christian context are rare. One of the few examples is in Ernest Reyer's opera \"Salammbô\" (1890).\n\nThe 1970 rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber ends with Jesus' crucifixion.\n\nThe cover art of Tupac Shakur's album features an image of Tupac being crucified on a cross. He stated that the image was not a mockery of Christ; rather, it showed how he was being \"crucified\" by the media. Multiple Marilyn Manson videos such as \"I Don't Like The Drugs But The Drugs Like Me\" and \"Coma White\" feature crucifixion imagery, often oddly staged in surreal modern or near modern-day settings. The Norwegian black metal band Gorgoroth had several people on stage affixed to crosses to give the appearance of crucifixion at a now infamous concert in Kraków, and repeated this act in the music video for \"Carving a Giant.\" In 2006, singer Madonna caused controversy by opening a concert held near Vatican City with a mock crucifixion, complete with a crown of thorns.\n\n\n"}

Today, in an abundance of smaller galleries and exhibition spaces in Dublin, The Douglas Hyde Gallery continues to sustain its reputation for holding exhibitions by some of the most established and well-regarded Irish and international artists working today.\n\nThe Douglas Hyde Gallery consists of two exhibition spaces that are used to show concurrent exhibitions, which often have a relating theme or tone.\n\nGallery 1, designed by Paul Koralek of ABK Architects, is the Gallery's main space and has played host to solo-exhibitions by renowned artists such as Fischli/Weiss, Marlene Dumas, Gabriel Orozco and Peter Doig. Notable Irish artists who have exhibited in Gallery 1 include: Dorothy Cross, Willie Doherty, Gerard Byrne, Patrick Graham, Patrick Hall, Michael Warren and Kathy Prendergast.\n\nGallery 2, which opened in 2001, was designed by McCullough Mulvin Architects. In addition to exhibitions by contemporary artists, this space is often used to show small collections of ethnographic objects and artefacts which are generally marginalised by larger museums and galleries. The most popular of these exhibitions have included: Nepalese Shamanic objects, Japanese Tea Bowls and Ghanaian Asafo Fante Flags.\n\nA number of exhibitions in Gallery 2 fall under ‘The Paradise’ series of shows, which invites artists to create a new work or present a series of works based on their own idea of ‘The Paradise’. As of February 2011, there have been 34 exhibitions in The Paradise series.\n\nThe Douglas Hyde Gallery produces publications for many of its exhibitions. These books can take the form of exhibition catalogues, artists’ books or curated projects and, while extremely different in content, they all share a similar exterior presentation. Since 2002, the Gallery has published over forty books in this small, hardback format.\n\nThe Leaves & Papers series of books and leaflets is an ongoing project which allows The Douglas Hyde Gallery to produce and publish ideas, images and texts relating to a specific theme or concept which does not always relate directly the Gallery's programme.\n\nAnother ongoing series of books documents the Galley's programme while also highlighting some of the central principles of the Gallery and its exhibitions. The books explore ideas about visual culture, identity, and spirituality through carefully selected texts and imagery. These books include: the bread and butter stone, 1997; Patmos, 1999; 33 Happy Moments, 2003; Alabama Chrome, 2007; The Bridge, 2008; Questions of Travel, 2009; Saunter, 2010.\n\nThe Douglas Hyde Gallery has become increasingly well known for its programme of musical events. In recent years, Cat Power, Sufjan Stevens and Laura Veirs have all played in the Gallery. Sometimes the musical performances relate directly to exhibitions: In 2008, Jandek performed a concert to coincide with an exhibition of his album covers and in 2009, Jim White played a gig to celebrate the opening of his exhibition of ephemera from the American South. It is more often the case that the performances and exhibitions share a mood or atmosphere rather than a direct connection.\n\n\n"}

Epstein mentioned in his speech that a future was possible in which customers would be able to print an out-of-stock title on the spot, if a book-printing machine could be made that would fit in a store. He founded 3BillionBooks with Michael Smolens, a Long Island entrepreneur in Russia, and Thor Sigvaldason, a consultant at Price Waterhouse Coopers.

He goes on to say that wisdom is one portion of the cognitive units that create the Semantic Ladder: Data, Information, Concept, Knowledge, and Wisdom. Targowski also gives his reasons as to why civilization is, as a whole, further behind than it was in Greek times on a philosophical level. He opines that even with the advances in the realm of Information Technology (IT), society remains unable to convert the information at its fingertips into the ultimate form of knowledge and wisdom. This book besides scientific synthesis of wisdom covers also the “art of living” and the decline in human ability to achieve its greatest potential as a global community.\n\n\"Biocosmology\" gave \"Harnessing the Power of Wisdom\" a positive review, stating that it was \"a remarkable wise contribution to the contemporary cultural world, forming an interdisciplinary theory of wisdom and conception of the wise Integralist civilization.

The film was written and directed by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg.\n\nThe story continues where \"Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle\" leaves off, with Harold Lee (John Cho) and Kumar Patel (Kal Penn) flying to Amsterdam, but they are imprisoned after being mistaken for terrorists, and end up on a series of comical misadventures when they escape from Guantanamo Bay. The film also stars Paula Garcés, Neil Patrick Harris, Jon Reep, Rob Corddry, Ed Helms, David Krumholtz, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Jack Conley, Roger Bart, Danneel Harris, Eric Winter, Adam Herschman, and Richard Christy.\n\nThe film was released on April 25, 2008 by Warner Bros.; this film was the first New Line Cinema title to be distributed by Warner Bros. since New Line Cinema became a division of Warner Bros. It is also the first \"Harold & Kumar\" film made in association with Mandate Pictures. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on July 29, 2008.\n\nAfter returning home from White Castle, Harold Lee and Kumar Patel decide to travel to Amsterdam, Netherlands so Harold can surprise his neighbor and newfound girlfriend Maria. At the airport, Kumar argues with a TSA agent for searching him “because of the color of his skin” despite the agent being black. The duo encounter Kumar's ex-girlfriend Vanessa Fanning, who is engaged to Colton Graham, a college friend of Harold's whose family has political connections. The plane passengers mistake Kumar's bong for a bomb and the duo are apprehended by sky marshals. Ron Fox, a neurotic and extremely racist Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, believes the duo are agents of a joint Al-Qaeda and North Korean conspiracy and send them to Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba. The duo escape and board a Cuban refugee boat to Miami, Florida where they begin their trek to Texas, hoping Colton can clear their names. \n\nThe duo endure several misadventures on their way to Texas, such as staying at the home of an incestuous sibling couple and their inbred son, escaping a Ku Klux Klan rally, and visiting a brothel with Neil Patrick Harris, who helps them evade capture from Fox. When they reach Texas, Colton agrees to exonerate the duo, but upon seeing Kumar reconnect with Vanessa, Colton instead delivers them to Fox. On the flight back to Cuba, Harold and Kumar subdue Fox’s men. When Fox tries confronting them he is knocked out by Dr. John Beecher the Vice Chairman of the NSA after Fox repeatedly treated him poorly. But he accidentally loses his footing, opens a door and falls to his death. Harold and Kumar escape via parachute, and Fox falls to his death while pursuing them. The two land in President George W. Bush's estate, and after smoking cannabis with the duo, Bush pardons them. The duo are escorted to Vanessa and Colton's wedding by the Secret Service and expose Colton's betrayal to Vanessa and the guests. Colton attempts to attack them, but Harold punches him out.

The term was used in Stove's book \"The Plato Cult\" as part of his argument against Karl Popper and other philosophers whom he characterised as \"modernists\". For Stove, Popper was influenced by the pervasive anti-Victorian mentality of the era, epitomised by Evelyn Waugh's book \"A Handful of Dust\", in which the absurdity of Victorian values is expressed by a parody of \"Victorian\" conceptions of the civilizing mission of imperialism, when the hero is finally trapped in the Amazonian jungle, forced eternally to read the works of Dickens to a tribal chief.\n\nFor Stove, the ascription of absurdity to Victorian culture was essentially a matter of taste, but one so powerful and irrational that it possessed the intensity of religious faith. As a result, it produced a revulsion – rather than a reasoned scepticism – to writers such as the Victorian philosopher of science William Whewell.\n\nFollowing Stove's usage, the term was taken up by the design historian Shelagh Wilson to refer to modernist distaste for Victorian architecture and design. Wilson argued that \"Palissyite\" design, influenced by the methods of Bernard Palissy, had been ridiculed and misunderstood by proponents of \"Puginite\" design, following the proto-modernist principles of Augustus Pugin. Wilson's argument formed part of a reaffirmation of the aesthetic principles of the grotesque.\n\nThe argument that distaste for Victorian cultural values ('Anti-victorianism') is irrational has been adopted by other writers,either following Stove's politically conservative attack on liberal thought, or Wilson's critique of modernism.\n\n\n\nVictorian Era\n"}

Portrayed by Vicky Entwistle, the character first appeared on-screen during the episode airing on 6 January 1997.\n\nOn 2 August 2010, it was announced that Entwistle had quit her role as Janice after 14 years on the show and would depart in 2011. She made her final appearance on 25 March 2011 after she leaves Weatherfield with her new boyfriend Trevor Dean (Steve Jackson) to go travelling around the world.\n\nJanice first appears in January 1997 as a new machinist at Mike Baldwin's (Johnny Briggs) garment factory \"Underworld\". In July 1997 she returns along with husband Les (Bruce Jones), daughter Toyah (Georgia Taylor) and stepdaughter Leanne (Jane Danson). She is consistently rude to her various managers at the factory. She breaks up with Les after having an affair with Dennis Stringer (Charles Dale) late in 2001, who is seeing Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver) at the time. Les is so upset that he attempts suicide on New Year's Day, and while driving him to hospital, they collide with another car. Les survives with minor injuries but Dennis is badly injured and later dies in hospital. Janice is left devastated by Dennis's death.\n\nIn March 2004, Janice sneaks into the storeroom at the factory for a crafty cigarette but drops the cigarette when caretaker Harry Flagg (Iain Rogerson) locks her in, a fire starts. Just before the whole room burns down, factory manager Nick Tilsley (Adam Rickitt) comes to her rescue - and as a result of the fire, she ends up in hospital and Nick is sacked by Mike.\n\nJanice later becomes involves with police officer, Mick Hopwood. When Mick and Les get into a fight, Les is unfairly imprisoned and Janice splits up with Mick. A later attempt at reconciliation with Les fails as a result of interference from Cilla Brown (Wendi Peters).\n\nIn the summer of 2005, Janice discovers, to her horror, that she has nits. Drunkenly, she asks friend Sean Tully (Antony Cotton) to shave her head. When she sees her bald head in the mirror, she is appalled. A couple of weeks later, she has a mud fight with resident Claire Peacock (Julia Haworth) on the Red Rec after Claire calls her a \"pug faced scumbag\".\n\nIn early 2006, Janice and Leanne are involved in a car accident, when Danny (Bradley Walsh) does not ask Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell) to perform a full service on the car. They crash into Gail Platt's (Helen Worth) front wall. Since then, Janice and Sally Webster become rivals as Janice feels that Sally and her daughter, Rosie, look down their noses at her. The rivalry comes to a head on 27 February 2006, when Janice is sacked by Danny Baldwin, and shortly after, she is punched by nemesis Sally, in the middle of the Rovers Return Inn. She leaves the Street in shame.\n\nHowever, it was reported in December 2005, that despite original plans for her to be written out of the series, Vicky Entwistle's contract was renewed. She goes to stay with Toyah in London in March 2006, but returns by April, telling Leanne that life in London was not any better than life in Weatherfield. She then helps Leanne as she discovers Mike's original will, that Leanne's boyfriend Danny does not know about.\n\nIn January 2007, Janice's heating breaks down and she calls plumber Roger Stiles (Andrew Dunn) to fix it, who arrives late. After socialising a bit, Roger asks Janice to go with him to France for a few months, which she accepts. She returns in March and Roger returns in June. She subsequently finds out that her stepdaughter Leanne is a prostitute; after everyone finds out, Janice gets into a catfight with co-worker Kelly Crabtree (Tupele Dorgu). Janice pleads with her to give up her work, but Leanne initially refuses as it is too lucrative. Eventually she admits that she can not continue and moves in with Janice. Janice and Roger reconcile, and Roger gives Leanne a loan for the restaurant she plans to open but his lack of money means he struggles to pay his rent, so he moves in with Janice. Leanne's restaurant burns down in April 2008. A few weeks later, Paul tells the police he and Leanne set the place on fire for insurance money. Janice is furious with Leanne for lying to her.\n\nIn September 2008, Janice and Leanne discover that one of the Lottery syndicate tickets for \"Underworld\" is a winner, to the tune of almost £25,000. Spotting an opportunity, Leanne persuades Janice that they should keep the money and claim the winnings by setting up a bogus bank account in Rosie Webster's (Helen Flanagan) name. However, Rosie has vanished, worrying her parents and when they learn of the lottery win, the police stop looking for Rosie, believing that she has absconded with the cash. Unable to live with her guilty conscience, Janice eventually comes clean on 8 October 2008 and is arrested while at work in the factory. The factory girls also tell Roger about the scam and he leaves Janice, disgusted at her behaviour. Janice is left on the Street in tears as Roger drives away. Leanne sees her from her upstairs window and callously just shuts the blind. In November, Janice stands trial for the scam alone, having agreed to keep Leanne's name out of it and is sentenced to community service, much to the disgust of her colleagues. She starts her work placement at the canteen at Weatherfield General Hospital in December and is initially delighted to discover that her supervisor is Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire), whom she sees as a pushover. However, she is proven wrong as Emily is very strict. On 29 December, she goes for a cigarette outside the hospital and meets Mike Scott (Anthony Bessick). He tells her he is in for a chest infection, downgraded from pneumonia. She tells him about her community service, and they laugh over their shared misfortune. Janice then goes back to work, but that night her friends tell her that she has been beaming the whole time she has been out with them, which suggests that she still has Mike on her mind.\n\nMike reappears on 30 January 2009, when he and Janice chat. However, he keels over and collapses. Janice gets help for Mike but later discovers that he has died, following an operation one week before. Mike's wife, Laura, is grateful that Janice was with him when he died. After this, Janice decides that she wants to become a nurse, despite ridicule from her friends, but her new boss, Luke Strong (Craig Kelly), sends her on a first-aid course in March 2009 and makes her the factory first-aider. Janice's skills come in useful when Joshua Peacock (Benjamin Beresford) collapses after swallowing a bee at the Street's summer fete. He is later rushed to hospital and recovers. Janice later tells Kelly that she does not want to be a nurse any more from the horror that Joshua could have died.\n\nIn January 2010, Trevor Dean, a local dustman, provokes Janice by refusing to empty her rubbish bin. In protest, she jumps onto the side of his bin lorry and holds on as he drives down the street. Later, the pair become friends, and after telling Trevor she is looking for a lodger, he agrees to move in with her. Janice is very attracted to him but he starts dating her boss, Carla Connor (Alison King). Janice is disappointed when Trevor later leaves Weatherfield after breaking up with Carla.\n\nOn 6 December 2010, a tram crashes onto the cobbles, following an explosion at 'The Joinery' Bar. Janice puts her first aid training to use, helping the injured in the Rovers. She also witnesses stepdaughter Leanne's wedding to Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne), which takes place in hospital as he was injured in the disaster.\n\nIn January 2011, Janice meets a man called Gaz at a singles night in the Rovers who invites her to go on holiday with him. However, she is too drunk to board the flight and returns later that evening. At this time, Chris Gray (Will Thorp) has paid an associate to rob Janice's flat, hoping to cause trouble for Streetcars; he is disturbed by her entry and runs off but knocks Janice to the ground and is left shaken. In the weeks following the burglary, Janice becomes very nervous of living alone and eventually gives up her flat, moving in with workmate Julie Carp (Katy Cavanagh). In March 2011, with \"Underworld\" struggling to remain afloat, Janice says the wrong thing once too often, when she tries to convince her co-workers to go on strike, and Carla sacks her. Janice is pleasantly surprised when she bumps into Trevor again. He tells her that he is only staying briefly as he is leaving to go on a world trip and suggests Janice go with him, a few days later. Now unemployed and with Leanne happily married to Peter, she agrees. After saying goodbye to Leanne, Janice's co-worker Izzy Armstrong (Cherylee Houston) spots her and tells the locals so they go outside to wave her off. Janice spots them coming out of the Rovers, so they drive into a puddle soaking all her friends and she shouts \"Losers\" as she drives off into the distance with Trevor.\n\nIn July 2011, Leanne received a phonecall from Janice to wish her happy birthday and tell her that she is currently working at a hotel in France. On this day, Leanne finds out that newcomer Stella Price (Michelle Collins) is her birth mother but decides not to tell Janice because she has been more of a mother to her than Stella ever was.\n\nIn an episode on 22 January 2014, Janice was mentioned by Leanne the episode after Hayley Cropper's (Julie Hesmondhalgh) death. Leanne mentioned her when asking \"Should I ring Janice, to tell her about Hayley?\". She was also mentioned by Leanne Battersby that she had sprained her ankle by falling off a ladder.\n\nThe mid 1990s were a time of big change behind-the-scenes at \"Coronation Street\". The long-running serial was being regularly beaten in the ratings by rival soap \"EastEnders\". A new producer, Brian Park, was brought in to revitalise the soap in 1997. Dubbed \"the axeman\", Park was responsible for culling 8 long-running and established characters, as well as giving the go-ahead for more controversial and sensationalist storylines, aimed at attracting a younger audience. He also introduced various new characters, among them were the Battersby family. Dubbed the \"family from hell\", the Battersbys were Janice and her husband Les, living with him and his daughter Leanne and a daughter of her own, Toyah, who was the result of a short-lived relationship Janice had with Ronnie Clegg when she was 16. Although not above occasional law-breaking, Janice was nowhere near as anti-social as Les.\n\nAuditions were held for the part of Janice Battersby with actress Vicky Entwistle going on to secure the role. In 2005 after 8 years in the show the character of Janice was axed by producer Tony Wood along with characters Sunita Alahan and Jessie Jackson. However a few weeks after the axing, a last-minute decision was made and the character was given a reprieve by the newly drafted producer Steve Frost. Of this decision the soaps spokesperson said: \"The new producer has talked to Vicky Entwistle and asked if she would like to stay with the programme. Janice is a very popular character, but ultimately it was the producer's own decision to keep her on, prompted by the great new storylines the character can play out.\"\n\nJanice is a very larger than life character and is not afraid of confrontation with other people. ITV publicity describes the character along with her former husband as 'Weatherfield's answer to Wayne and Waynetta Slob' but did stress that her character has shown her softer side in certain storylines such as Toyah's rape and proved she actually does have morals when she tried to stop Leanne's prostititution. Her manager at Underworld from 2004 to 2006, Danny Baldwin, had his own nickname for her: \"Lippy\" because of her loud mouth and answering back. An inside spokesperson for Coronation Street said of Janice's character in 2005 that: \"She is well loved for being such a feisty character who can get quite nasty at times.\".\n\nJanice's recognisable appearance and loud mouth tendencies led to her being spoofed on ITV TV show 2DTV.\n"}

{"id": "35585812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35585812", "title": "Letters of Charles Lamb", "text": "Letters of Charles Lamb\n\nThe 19th-century English writer Charles Lamb's letters were addressed to, among others, William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Godwin, and Thomas Hood, all of whom were close friends. They are valued for the light they throw on the English literary world in the Romantic era and on the evolution of Lamb's essays, and still more for their own \"charm, wit and quality\".\n\nMore than 1,150 of Lamb's letters survive, scattered among institutions and private collections in Britain and the United States. The largest collection, comprising about 200 letters, is in the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. There are very few existing letters addressed to Lamb apart from those sent by his friend Thomas Manning, since Lamb usually destroyed his old correspondence. Lamb wrote his letters in a \"bold free hand and a fearless flourish\" (his own words), which present no great difficulties to editors, though his spelling and punctuation were sometimes erratic.\n\nLamb's main correspondents were the poets William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Robert Southey, Thomas Hood, Bernard Barton, Mary Matilda Betham and Bryan Procter; the philosopher and novelist William Godwin; the music critic William Ayrton; the publishers Edward Moxon, William Hone, Charles Ollier, Charles Cowden Clarke and J. A. Hessey; the statistician John Rickman; the actress Fanny Kelly; the political agitator Thomas Allsop; the Sinologist Thomas Manning; the lawyer Henry Crabb Robinson; also John Bates Dibdin, member of a theatrical family, and Robert Lloyd from a literary Quaker family. The surviving letters extend over a period of nearly 40 years, beginning in May 1796 and ending only a few days before his death in December 1834. In the first sequence of 30 letters written to Coleridge he minutely criticises his friend's poems, advising him to abandon conventional poetic diction and \"cultivate simplicity\". The influence he exercised on his friend is seen as crucial in preparing Coleridge for the Romantic revolution that he and Wordsworth launched two years later in their \"Lyrical Ballads\". Almost from the beginning the letters show Lamb's sense of duty to his family and friends, but after a few years, without abandoning his moral convictions, Lamb found a lighter means of expression. In an 1801 letter he wrote, \"I have had a time of seriousness, and I have known the importance and reality of a religious belief. Latterly, I acknowledge, much of my seriousness has gone off…but I still retain at bottom a conviction of the truth, and a certainty of the usefulness of religion.\" In the later letters it is often possible to see Lamb forming and developing the ideas that he later presented in fully matured form in the \"Essays of Elia\" and other magazine pieces, and in this way they proved to be essential to his career as a published writer.\n\nThe humour and (as he often said) \"nonsense\" of his letters is sometimes seen as a disguise for mental instability and deep anguish. The essayist Augustine Birrell wrote that \"He took refuge in trivialities seriously, and played the fool in order to remain sane.\" The letters have a great deal to say about Lamb's incessant reading, often among 17th century writers, and it has been argued that his love of Robert Burton, Thomas Browne and the Jacobean tragedies may show an underlying depression and despair which answered to theirs. Lamb's words on Burton have frequently been taken as applying to himself: \"Burton was a man often assailed by deepest melancholy, and at other times much given to laughing and jesting, as is the way with melancholy men.\"\n\nThackeray was so impressed by the beauty of Lamb's character as revealed in his letters that he once pressed one of them to his forehead and exclaimed \"Saint Charles!\" It was the opinion of Thomas Noon Talfourd, who knew Lamb well, that there was scarcely one of his letters \"which has not some tinge of that quaint sweetness, some hint of that peculiar union of kindness and whim, which distinguishes him from all other poets and humorists.\" Lamb's reputation as a writer may have fallen since the 19th and early 20th centuries, at any rate among academic critics, but he has never been short of readers who agree with the essayist E. V. Lucas as to \"the value and importance of these letters, their good sense, their wit, their humanity, their fun, their timeliness and timelessness\".\n\nAs early as February 1835 a decision was made to prepare a collection of Lamb's letters. Thomas Noon Talfourd was chosen as the editor, and his \"Letters of Charles Lamb\" appeared in 1837. 180 of Lamb's letters appeared in this collection, according to Edwin Marrs's count, though Talfourd's contents page suggests a different number because of his (and several later editors') practice of separating and recombining passages to form, in effect, letters that never were. The number he could print was limited by the need to protect the feelings of Lamb's surviving friends, and still more those of his sister Mary, whose periodic fits of insanity Lamb had many times explicitly referred to. With Mary's death the need for tactful suppression became less pressing, and a supplementary collection consisting of 82 entirely new letters, Talfourd's \"Final Memorials of Charles Lamb\", appeared in 1848.\n\nA projected third edition of the letters was to have been edited first by Talfourd and then by William Carew Hazlitt, but both editors successively abandoned the job. The editorship was then given to the journalist George Augustus Henry Sala, who completed the first volume of a \"Complete Correspondence and Works of Charles Lamb\". This was printed in 1868, but no further volumes were ever produced. A new \"Complete Correspondence and Works of Charles Lamb\", edited by the drama critic Thomas Purnell, containing 337 letters, appeared in 1870 in 4 volumes, the letters being also issued separately in one volume. Another drama critic, Percy Fitzgerald, edited a \"Life, Letters and Writings of Charles Lamb\" in 1876 with 451 letters, and this, like all previous collections, was published by Edward Moxon.\n\nWilliam Carew Hazlitt then returned to the task he had previously abandoned, and produced a \"Letters of Charles Lamb\" in 1886, based on Talfourd's two collections but with much revision and addition, so that the number of letters now totalled 488. \"The Letters of Charles Lamb\" were edited only two years later by Alfred Ainger in 1888, and re-edited in 1900 and 1904; these collections numbered 414, 446 and 464 letters respectively, making them in point of size inferior to Hazlitt's edition, and further disfigured by a good deal of bowdlerisation. An edition by William Macdonald, containing 581 letters, appeared in 1903. \"The Letters of Charles Lamb\", issued by the Bibliophile Society of Boston in 1905 with an introduction by Henry Howard Harper, increased the tally considerably to 746 letters.\n\nThe first of E. V. Lucas's editions appeared as volumes 6 and 7 of his \"Works of Charles and Mary Lamb\" (1903–1905), and for the first time included Mary's correspondence on equal terms. It contained only 590 letters, but he highlighted one of the problems which had caused his and several previous editions to leave out easily findable material:Owing to the curious operations of the law of copyright, it will not for at least forty-two years be possible for any one edition of Lamb's correspondence to contain all the letters. To-day, in order to possess a set complete down to the present time, one must purchase at least nine, and possibly more, works, amounting to many volumes―among them \"Charles Lamb and the Lloyds\", of which I was the editor, but which I am debarred from using.His second edition was published in 1912 with 604 letters. His third edition, \"The Letters of Charles Lamb, to which is Added Those of His Sister Mary Lamb\" (1935), included as many as 1,027 letters, Lucas's publishers having negotiated a solution to the copyright problems, so that he was able to claim that \"The present edition of the letters of Charles Lamb is the first to bring all the known material into one work.\" Even Lucas's harshest critics acknowledge that the 1935 edition's completeness made it the best available up to that point, but several papers in academic journals by George L. Barnett and other Lamb scholars have made it clear that the texts are unreliable. Barnett complained that Lucas appeared not to have read manuscript letters of whose location he was well aware, that on the contrary many, if not most, of the letters are based on previous and faulty editions, and that Lucas has failed to avoid the tendency of editors of Lamb's letters to perpetuate errors and to inaugurate others by overzealous emendation, excessive editing, and downright carelessness. He elsewhere referred to \"faulty dating, erroneous location of manuscripts, incorrect transcription of text, and misinformation in the notes\".\n\nIn the years 1975 to 1978 three volumes of a new edition of Charles and Mary Lamb's letters were published by Edwin W. Marrs, which included many new letters discovered during the previous 40 years. Lamb's life was covered up to 1817, and further volumes were intended to carry on up to his death in 1834, but to date none have appeared. The three published volumes have attracted great praise for their exceptionally full annotation and for the completeness and accuracy of the texts.\n\n\n\n"}

Examples of record charts are the Hit parade, Hot 100 or Top 40. Although primarily a marketing or supermarketing tool like any other sales statistic, they have become a form of popular media culture in their own right.\n\nRecord charts are compiled using a variety of criteria. These commonly include sales of records, cassettes and compact discs; amount of radio airplay; requests to radio disk jockeys; voting for songs by the radio listeners and, recently, number of downloads.\n\nSome charts are specific to a particular musical genre and most to a particular geographical location. The most common period of time covered by a chart is one week, with the chart being printed or broadcast at the end of this time. Summary charts for years and decades are then calculated from their component weekly charts. Component charts have become an increasingly important way to measure the commercial success of individual songs.\n\nReviewers often describe records using round number milestones within a chart. For example, a record that peaks at number 7 may be called a \"Top 10\" hit, even when there is no chart limited to only the top 10 records in that particular location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was the son of Luigi Bernasconi (electrician) and Caterina Dozio (seamstress). He grew up with his sister Maria (Nini), who was two years younger.\n\nHe was attracted to what he called \"la mia montagna\" (my mountain) - San Salvatore. On the mountain, he discovered clay and received his first inspirations. During his childhood, beside the school there was the country life. He brought home lizards, snakes, insects of every kind, which he studied and observed attentively.\n\n1914 - Once the obligatory schools terminated and having to learn a trade, Mario worked in a pharmacy in Lugano. In the evening he posed as a model in the studio of the sculptor Luigi Vassalli. Captured by the arts, Mario left the pharmacy and became a student of Luigi Vassalli (monument to Carlo Battaglini). He appears as the angel-like figure in the monument. In addition to posing and performing hard work, he learned the art of moulding, design in relief, and the study of the human body. In carving marble and shaping clay he was more than ever convinced to become a sculptor.\n1917 - Mario continued his studies by the painter and sculptor Giuseppe Foglia and started his own studio in Pazzallo, in the house that is now the Mario Bernasconi Museum. \nIn his studies, Mario was deeply inspired by Michelangelo, Donatello, Rodin, Maillol and Lehmbruck.\n\nMario obtained the first Federal scholarship that was renewed for three consecutive years:\n\n1921 - the mask La scema (the idiot) \n1922 - the portraits of \"Enea\" and \"Eva\".\n\n1923 - the bust \"La giovane madre\" Mario with the young Mother\nHe made portraits of his friends, among them Angelo Tonello, the painters Filippo Boldini, Gualtiero Colombo, the writers Vinicio Salati Francesco Manzoni and Silvio Calloni the naturalist from Pazzallo.\nHe created the head of \"Cristo\" (Christ) that stands atop the steps of San Pietro Pambio Cemetery, at the center of the big stone cross.\n\n1923 - His mother became ill and died. A period of inertia followed, but it's the portrait of his mother that brought back his creativity.\n\n1925- At the National Exhibition of Fine Art at the Kunsthaus Zurich, the Federal Government acquired the statue \"Il Curato di campagna\" (The country Priest) and donated the bronze to the city of Lugano\nThe full plaster figure can be seen at the Museum in Pazzallo.\nOn June 13, 1926, in New York, on the Daily News of the workers of America, \"The New World\" in the center of the front page appears the reproduction of the sculpture \"Il Martire\" (The Martyr) by Mario Bernasconi. It was Giacomo Matteotti, which in New York on that day, the second year of his death was commemorated. Bernasconi later donated this sculpture to the Chamber of Labor in Lugano.\n\nThe artist demonstrates to be a free-thinker, a great lover of nature, mystic, philosopher, intuitive, poet, romantic. His family and friends considered him to be gentle and having a good character, a bit narcissistic, sentimental and emotional. Sometimes argumentative at times revolutionary and remembered for his motto \"Lottare per non morire\" (Fight not to die).\n\nOf the encounter with friends, writes Francesco Manzoni in the volume \"Mario Bernasconi Scultore\" Editions Aurora, Lugano:\n\n\"\"Then the political rounds would break loose and Mario wearing the Valiere tie, was singing Bandiera Rossa (Red Flag) and the hymn to the anarchists or he would play them on the mouth accordion, his face assuming a faun flavor whereby his authentic faith was affirmed without reservation: perhaps with great anger, that sometimes had the epic of Brecht and when cooled off, ended with the recitation of a scarlet \"Ca ira.\"\"\n\nMatured by the strong impression of the Egyptian sculptures, Greek and Roman, the one of the Renaissance, the neo-Gothic of Lehmbruck, the realism of Rodin, Mario Bernasconi found his own style. \nFor art studies, he gives preference to the cities of Siena and Florence (Firenze) and he continues his formation through contact with artists and intellectuals.\nWorks in central Switzerland, Zurich, Bern and Glarus.\n\n1927 - Marks the beginning of a very moving and rich successful career. Le sculture all'aperto nella citta di Lugano, pagina 115, Biografie \nThrough the family von Alvensleben of Porza, Mario meets Irma Pannes, a descendant of a distinguished German family, who became his wife. The bride and groom depart for Germany. First stop Freiburg, Darmstadt and Wiesbaden. He meets with Werneralvo von Alvensleben in Berlin for the first\nPorza Association exhibit that took place in Berlin on December 9, 1927. While waiting for a studio in Berlin he travels with his wife to Reichenbach in Slesia thereafter reaching the city of Prague, rich in works of art.\nBeing the Swiss Italian artist with Werner von Alvensleben and the Russian painter Arthur Bryks, founders of the Porza Association the inauguration of their second exhibit is taking place on March 25, 1928, in Berlin.\n\nThe period in Berlin turns out to be the most useful and prolific of his career, especially for the contacts that the friendly atmosphere permits him to establish and for the friendly relations with leading personalities of the artistic, scientific and literary world. With enthusiasm, he makes the portrait of the German writer Carl Zuckmayer while he made a drawing of the sculptor at work. He becomes friend with Erich Maria Remarque, who at that time worked on the famous novel \"Im Westen nichts Neues\". He meets La Jana(actress)Jana the famous dancer of the Thirties, makes the portrait of the actress Elisabeth Lennartz Elisabeth Lennartz takes part in the \"Grosse Berliner Kunst Austellung 1928\".\nIn Potsdam at the Gutmann estate/ \nVilla he spends a period of great prosperity with the family of the Banker Gutmann (director of the Dresden Bank) where he creates the portraits of the banker, his wife Daisy and their and two children and a sculpture for their park estate.\n\nThe following trips take him to Krefeld the birth-city of his wife, Duesseldorf, Frankfurt on the Main, Munich in Bavaria, Breslavia and Paris where another \"Porza\" home was erected. In those cities, he created and left numerous artworks.\n\n1929-1933 - The artist returns to Ticino with his wife Irma and rents a home in Sala Capriasca \nFrom his artistic standpoint what he wants to achieve is the static, a balanced and contained movement emanating silence.\nSeveral works were created:\n\"Il busto di Irma\" (bust of Irma) a Federal purchase that can be seen Martin Disteli Museum of Olten.\nIn 1931 he creates: \"La Preghiera\" (The Prayer) for the tomb in the cemetery of San Pietro Pambio, of the family Ostilio Foglia.\nThe statue of L'Asceta,(The Ascetic) the one of The Adolescent.

Professor Emilio Motta al Liceo di Lugano. Professor Angelo Pizzorno Liceo di Lugano. Pastor Nicolas-Boldt, writer in Lugaggia; Professor Gogarten of the University of Jena; Cornelia Forster; Emil Mauser, industrial from Zurich.\n\nIn 1933 he takes part in the Exposition SPSAS at the Kunsthaus Zurich and at the Staatliche Kunstaustellung Munich.\nMany artists and friends from Berlin and Zurich come to visit his home in Sala Capriasca.\nFrom the book \"Mario Bernasconi Scultore\" Editions Aurora Lugano, Vinicio Salati writes in \"L'amico\" (Friend):\n\"From this couple of artists new forces are resumed.\"\nA young Russian artist wrote:\n\"... for me and many of my friends, Sala is like a pilgrimage.\"\n\nThe artist wanted to purchase the home but the owner would not sell it. Reluctantly they had to leave the beloved residence that was their paradise, and a favorite gathering place for many international artists. Mario would miss it forever. They find temporary residence in Montarina above Lugano, at the Villa Beausite\n\n1934 - At the Villa Beausite his sister's son, L'Adolescente (The Adolescent), Giuseppe (Teti) is posing for him. A slender boy figure, of which there are several statues that represent him, such as the bronze on the museum facade in Pazzallo.\n\n1935 - Portrait of the famous pianist Claudio Arrau, that poses for him at the Villa Beausite. \nThe setting of the great bronze statue \"La donna distesa\" (The reclining woman) at the Carona cemetery.\n\nTravel in Italy, especially Tuscany, Florence and Siena. A trip to Bad Godesberg, Germany where he creates the statue of \"St. Anthony\" for the Marienheim.\n\n1936 - Rents a home in the center of Cureglia, remaining there for 25 years.\nThe home is of the 1500s. It belongs to the Fontana family and it had always been a home and gathering place for artists. The last tenant, before Bernasconi lived there, was the painter Ernesto Fontana, who lived in Milan, and occupied the home in Cureglia during the warm seasons. The building, filled with relief and stucco work, was always visited by artists who left signatures, writings and poems on the veranda walls.\n\n1937 - Birth of daughter Claudia and the sculptor makes the portrait when the baby is 13 days old.\nThe bronze \"Neonata\" (Newborn) is at the Government building in Bellinzona.\n\n1939 - Completes the project of Cristo (Christ) for the family Rickenbach tomb in Schwyz.\nTakes part at the great exhibition, Landesaustellung Zurich where he creates before the public.\n\nBernasconi finds a large studio in Lugano, along the Cassarate river, where companion artists work such as Boldini, Ribola, Moglia, and others.\n\n1942 - Federal acquisition of the portrait Francesco Chiesa portrait at the Palazzo Comunale in Castagnola.\n\n1943 - Mario Bernasconi presents four projects for the Madonna that will be placed in front of the San Lorenzo Cathedral in Lugano. The competition is organized by Pro Helvetia. Over forty-six participating sculptors, Mario is the winner with the \"Virgo Potens\" project. He meets Amelia Anastasi Quadri, a pianist from Lugano, who was discovered and encouraged as a child, by Giacomo Puccini. She poses as a model for the statue of the Madonna.\n\n1945 - Another Federal acquisition is the portrait of \"Cornelia\".\n\n1946 - The great statue of the Madonna di San Lorenzo commissioned by Pro Helvetia and the city of Lugano, executed in fine Saltrio marble, also referred to as Virgo Potens is inaugurated and placed in the courtyard of the San Lorenzo Cathedral overlooking the city of Lugano.\nThe speech is held by Luigi Caglio of that artwork exalted in: \"L'affermazione dei valori della vita\" \"The affirmation of life's values\"\n\n\"\"Among the values of life that Mario Bernasconi was a firm believer, was a religiosity that without being subject to discipline, without making a profession of faith in certain dogmas, is indisputable. This spiritual position came to light in the statue of the Madonna that stands in front of the Cathedral of San Lorenzo. Of all the verses of the litany, the artist chose the one that most reflected his intentions. \"Virgo Potens\". The woman who has been shaken and trembled at the Annunciation, the Mother who generated the divine infant in the squalor of the Bethlehem stable, the one who will be torn from the atrocious sufferings inflicted on the Son, this statue symbolizes a vigorous vitality. Seeing her, one is induced to enter the word robur (fortress) in the Salve Regina, where Mary is pleaded as life dulcedo et spes nostra. \"\"\n\nHis works have seen and endured many moves and travels in Switzerland and abroad.\n\n1947 - 1949 - Again the sculptor is without a workshop. He is offered a studio in the village of Vezia. He survives by creating funerary art.\n\n1950 - Creates Il Tobiolo (Boy with fish) for the school fountain in Massagno:: The statue \"La Dolente\" (The Sufferer) for Family Poretti tomb, Lugano cemetery.\n\n1951 - He finds a large Atelier (workshop) in the building of the Italian Consulate, at Via Dufour in Lugano.\nThere he stays and works for the rest of his life.\n\n1952 - Creates the great relief \"Demeter\" for the Franchini Residence in Lugano.\n\n1953 - He delivers to the Agricultural Institute of Mezzana, the mighty statue Il Seminatore (The Sower).This work of art was commissioned by President Etter and is the property of the State and Canton Ticino art collection.\n\n1954 - Creates the statue the Risveglio, which was placed in 1981 in the Belvedere Park by Lake Lugano, along with artworks by other famous artists.\n\n1955 - Inauguration in Bever (Engadine) of \"Pastorello con pecora\" (Sheperd with sheep) and a second one dedicated to the \"Marmotte\".\n\n1956 - Inauguration of the Acquaiola (The Water carrier) on the Quai of Paradiso in the center of the fountain.\n\nRegarding the Water-carrier a very positive critique appeared, on March 9, 1956 by Prof. Charly Clerc, entitled: \"Sculpteur tessinois\" on the front page of the Journal de Geneve, . Here translated from the French:\n\n\"\"Mario Bernasconi is a fine and original artist who has worked hard. The projects in his studio stand to demonstrate not only a distinguished artist but a great artist\"\n\n\"Soon in Paradiso the inauguration will take place of the young girl that draws water from the fountain, that is an ensemble of gentleness, grace and grandeur.\"\"\n\nOn the ACQUAIOLA the painter Mario Guberti Helfricht from Ravenna, on the invitation for the centenary celebration of Mario Bernasconi 1899-1999 by the city of Lugano responded expressing as follows (in the Italian language) :\n\n\"L'opera riprodotta e' un capolavoro,un vero inno alla bellezza femminile,quale solo un grande artista poteva fare.\"\n\nEnglish translation: \"The ACQUAIOLA is a masterpiece, a true hymn to female beauty, as only a great artist could do\"\n\n1960 - 1963 - The company Baylender of Milan, asks Mario Bernasconi to create, for the centennial occasion of the Kleinewefers company in Germany, the statue Il Genio del lavoro (Genius der Arbeit)\n\nFor the Pedrinis establishment, he creates the relief (his last work) \"Il mercato di Lugano\" (Lugano's market) the third panel remained unfinished.\n\nMario Bernasconi died the morning of March 19, 1963, at the Italian Hospital in Viganello, a day after the death of his sister.\nThe double funeral takes place on March 21, at the cemetery of San Pietro Pambio.\nThe Government officials of the \"Dicastero della Cultura\" were present with Aldo Patocchi, President of the \"Societa' Ticinese delle Belle Arti\".\nVinicio Salati and Cesco Manzoni, two faithful friends to the end, gave a farewell speech.\n\n\"The artwork and the personality of Mario Bernasconi, one of the\nmaximum sculptors of the period, have not yet been the object of deep\nstudies, which constitutes a serious gap for the comprehension of the\nsouthern Swiss artistic reality of the first half of the 20th century.\"\nquote by Elisabeth Voyame translated from the Italian on Arte in Ticino, categoria arte 2003, third\nvolume, page 330, article 112.\n\nAt that time a decision was made by his daughter to create a Museum to collect and preserve his artworks.\n\n1920 - Bernasconi shows his works at the Museo Villa Ciani Lugano for the exhibitions of the Societa' Ticinese delle Belle Arti.\n\nFrom the local Exhibits, he passes to the Confederate centers to the Turnus, open at the Kunsthaus Zurich.\nFrom there, his presence remains constant to the end.\n\n1925 - Kunsthaus Zurich.

{"id": "680321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=680321", "title": "Martin (TV series)", "text": "Martin (TV series)\n\nMartin is an American sitcom that aired for five seasons on Fox from August 27, 1992, to May 1, 1997. Reflecting the rising popularity of the Fox network throughout the 1990s, \"Martin\" was one of the network's highest-rated shows during the sitcom's run.\n\nSet in Detroit, Michigan the series stars Martin Lawrence in the role of Martin Payne, a disc jockey with a girlfriend named Gina Waters (Tisha Campbell-Martin). Martin works for the fictional radio station WZUP and later for local Public-access television station Channel 51. A common theme of the series is Martin's selfish and free-spirited nature. Episodes often center on Martin's inappropriate behaviors and incessant smart mouth towards his friends, neighbors, and whoever else finds themselves in his presence. When all is said and done, however, Martin loves his family and friends—it just takes dire situations for him to show it.\n\nAs the series progressed, plotlines saw Martin eventually move on to become the host of the talk show \"Word on the Street\", which aired on the small Detroit public-access television station Channel 51. He retained this position until the series' final episode, in which he and Gina prepared to move to Los Angeles, from where his show would be syndicated nationally. The move coincided fortuitously with Gina's promotion by her boss Mr. Whitaker to head up his company's new Los Angeles headquarters, after having shut down the Detroit office. Gina's best friend Pam, whom Whitaker let go two episodes earlier due to this consolidation and downsizing, went on to pursue a career in the music industry as an artists & repertoire (A&R), executive at Keep It Real Records. (This plotline is the subject of a backdoor pilot episode that was included in the \"Martin\" series for a planned sitcom on Fox starring Tichina Arnold to be called \"Goin' for Mine\" (Episode 129, \"Goin' for Mine\"). This sitcom never materialized, however.) And at series' end, Cole proposed to his even more dimwitted, but attractive and devoted girlfriend Shanise (portrayed by Maura McDade), and they made plans to move into their own place. The only actor to appear in every episode as the same character is Thomas Mikal Ford as Tommy.\n\nIn early episodes, Lawrence began with a monologue of him speaking directly to the camera and audience from the darkened radio studio.\n\nIn 1997, Tisha Campbell filed a lawsuit against her co-star Martin Lawrence and the show's producers for sexual harassment and verbal and physical assaults, and she did not appear in most of the season five episodes. The explanation in most of the episodes Campbell did not appear in was that Gina was \"out on business\", though in the two-part episode \"Going Overboard\" it was stated that Gina had arrived too late to board the boat for the trip alongside everyone else. HBO Studios eventually settled the case with Campbell so that the show's last season could be completed. Campbell did return to the Martin set to film the two-part series finale of the show under the condition that she would not share any scenes with or interact in any way with Martin Lawrence. In the episode, Martin and Gina kept entering and exiting the sets at different times and the storyline was adjusted so that the characters were both part of it but never crossed paths.\n\n\n\n\nOne of the trademark running gags of \"Martin\", especially early in its run, was Lawrence playing multiple characters, utilizing various costumes and prosthetic appliances. This was often done as a plot device or comic relief. Season four was the last season to feature Lawrence as multiple characters on a regular basis. This technique was rarely used in Season 5, which was the final season of the series. The only characters that appeared in Season 5 were Sheneneh, Roscoe and Elroy. Mama Payne does not appear but her voice is heard in the holiday episode \"Scrooge\". Most of the other characters were last seen in Season 4 and the episodes they last appeared in seemingly wrote them out of the series.\n\nReruns have been seen in first run syndication in the past. Reruns began airing on MTV2 on February 21, 2011. As of October 2015, reruns of Martin now air on BET and as of 2018, VH1.\n\nHBO Home Video has released all five seasons of \"Martin\" on DVD in Region 1.\n\nIn January 2018, rumors have circulated that the popular series was possibly slated for a reboot due to a post that Martin Lawrence's fiance teased on Instagram, which made viral headlines to a popular blog The Shade Room. She posted a picture of the Martin TV show title card logo with the caption: \"Got word from my fiance that my favorite TV show may be coming back\" ending the comment with the peeking wide eyes emoji and Martin replied to the post with the same emoji, which can insinuate a common nod towards each other. \"HipHollywood\", another internet entertainment media blog, questioned Tisha Campbell-Martin on the rumor during an interview, in which she gave a ecstatic response that she can't speak upon it stating \"It has been an honor to be Gina all these years and its surprising that people still love those characters so much. So, i can't tell you guys anything, but it is very excitng\". Adding insult to injury, a few days later during an E! News Daily Pop interview, she was caught off guard by the host who asked her about it, and instead of answering it, she jokingly denied it and brushed it off by changing the subject. Her responses caused an immediate interest from all media outlets to believing that she confirmed a possible reboot.\n\nEarly February, TMZ caught up with Tichina Arnold, Tisha Campbell-Martin and Martin Lawrence altogether leaving Morton's Steakhouse in Burbank, California, all smiles and anticipating the same question. Martin replied by saying \"Never Say Never\", Tichina added by stating \"\"In life there's always new beginnings, and there's always change...so we'll see what's happening\".\" Tisha ended it bluntly and jokingly by blurting out \"We can't tell y'all shit, how 'bout that\", The interview continues to go more in depth about questioning the shows popularity from the past and how a reboot can be made up to date with current events and hold its' popularity if it's greenlighted. Tichina and Tisha's responses kind of hinted and gave it away that it may happen, but realizes the questions already pushed them to reveal their answer, in which Tisha ends it with the same blunt quote she stated earlier in the interview. The interview is also the first time Tisha and Martin is seen publicly together since their past cast debacle, which was part of the reason for the show's cancellation in 1997.\n\n"}

{"id": "3615017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3615017", "title": "Persian dance", "text": "Persian dance\n\nPersian dance or Iranian dance (Persian:رقص ایرانی) refers to the dance styles indigenous to Iran. Genres of dance in Iran vary depending on the area, culture, and language of the local people, and can range from sophisticated reconstructions of refined court dances to energetic folk dances. The population of Iran includes many ethnicities, such as Kurds, Azerbaijanis, Turkmen, Jews, Armenian, Georgian peoples, in addition to numerous Iranian tribal groups which can be found within the borders of modern-day Iran. Each group, region, and historical epoch has specific dance styles associated with it. Raghs (also spelled as Raqs) is the Arabic word for dance, and is almost exclusively the word used for dance in Persian, as the Persian word for dance, paykubi, is no longer in common usage. It's also the word in Azerbaijani for dance (\"Reqs\"). The Kurdish word for dance is Halperke, and the Lurs from Lorestan use the word Bākhten (or Bāzee) for dance.\n\nPeople of Iranian plateau have known dance in forms of music, play, drama or religious rituals and have used instruments like mask, costumes of animals or plants, and musical instruments for rhythm, at least since 6th millennium BC. Cultural mixed forms of dance, play and drama have served rituals like celebration, mourning and worship. And the actors have been masters of music, dance, physical acts and manners of expression. Artifacts with pictures of dancers, players or actors were found in many of archaeological prehistoric sites in Iran, like Tepe Sabz, Ja'far Abad, Chogha Mish, Tall-e Jari, Cheshmeh Ali, Ismaeel Abad, Tal-e bakun, Tepe Sialk, Tepe Musian, tepe Yahya, Shahdad, Tepe Gian, Kul Farah, Susa, Kok Tepe, Cemeteries of Luristan, etc.\n\nThe earliest researched dance from historic Iran is a dance worshiping Mithra (as in the Cult of Mithras) in which a bull was sacrificed. This cult later became highly adhered in the Roman Empire. This dance was to promote vigor in life. Ancient Persian dance was significantly researched by Greek historian from Herodotus of Halikarnassos, in his work \"Book IX (Calliope)\", in which he describes the history of Asian empires and Persian wars until 478 BC. Ancient Persia was occupied by foreign powers, first Greeks, then Arabs, and then Mongols and in turn political instability and civil wars occurred. Throughout these changes a slow disappearance of heritage dance traditions occurred.\n\nAfter the fall of Persian Empire, when the country was torn into pieces, Iranian women and young girls were enslaved by the new conquerors, often forced into sexual slavery and required to perform erotic dances for the new rulers. Religious prohibition of dancing in Iran came with the spread of Islam, but it was spurred by historical events. Religious prohibition to dancing waxed and waned over the years, but after the Iranian Revolution in 1979 dancing was no longer allowed due to its frequent mixing of the sexes. The Islamic Revolution of 1979, was the end of a successful era for dancing and the art of ballet in Iran. The Iranian national ballet company was dissolved and its members emigrated to different countries. According to the principles of the “cultural revolution” in Iran, dancing was considered to be perverse, a great sin, immoral and corrupting. As a result, many of the talented Persian dancers moved to the West and spread out mainly in Europe and the United States and new generation of Iranian dancers and ballet artists have grown up in the Diaspora.\n\nIran possesses four categories of dance and these genres are; chain or line dances, solo improvisational dance, war or combat dances and ritual or spiritual dances.\n\nChain or Line dances are often named for the region or the ethnic groups with which they are associated.\n\nSolo dance includes usually reconstructions of Safavid and Qajar Court Dance. These often are improvisational dances and utilize delicate, graceful movements of the hands and arms, such as wrist circles.\n\nWar or Combat dances imitate combat, or help train the warrior. It could be argued that men from the zurkhaneh (a traditional Persian style gymnasium) called the “House of Strength” and their ritualized, wrestling-training movements are known as a type of dance called Raghs-e-Pa but could also been seen as a martial art.\n\nRitual or spiritual dances, are often Sufi are known as sama and also a type of zikr (religious chant). There are various types of dancing in a trance for healing practices in Iran and surrounding areas. One healing ritual that involves trance, music, and movement is called le’b guati of the Baluchis of Eastern Iran, which is performed to rid a possessed person of the possessing spirit and appears to be in a similar state as an exorcism. There is a term in Balochi \"gowati\" for psychologically ill patients (possessed by wind) who have recovered through music healing, music as medicine. The southern coastal regions of Iran such as Qeshm Island have a similar possession by wind ceremony and it is thought that it may be influenced or originated in Africa, particularly the Abyssinian or Ethiopian region.\n\nThe word sama\",\" from the Arabic root meaning “to listen,” refers to the spiritual practice of listening to music and achieving unity with the Divine, it is spelled sema in Turkish. Dancing mystics (regardless of their specific religious identifications) are called Dervish.\n\nContemporary social dances and urban dance performed at festive occasions like weddings and Noruz celebrations focus less on communal line or circle dances and more on solo improvisational forms, with each dancer interpreting the music in her own special way but within a specific range of dance vocabulary sometimes blending other dance styles or elements.\n\nThis is a list of some of the ancient and contemporary Persian dances, from various ethnic groups within Iran. \n\nThis list of contemporary and historical Persian dancers or choreographers (in alphabetical order, of various dance styles) includes:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1474806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1474806", "title": "Populous (company)", "text": "Populous (company)\n\nPopulous is a global architectural firm specializing in the design of sports facilities, arenas and convention centers, as well as the planning of major special events.\n\nPopulous formerly operated as HOK Sport Venue Event, which was part of the HOK Group. In January 2009, Populous was created through a management buyout, becoming independently owned and operated. It is reported to be one of the largest architecture firms in the world.\n\nIn 1983, HOK under Jerry Sincoff created a sports group (initially called the Sports Facilities Group and later changed to HOK Sport Venue Event). The firm initially consisted of eight architects in Kansas City, and grew to employ 185 people by 1996.\n\nOn several projects, HOK Sport had teamed with international design practice LOBB Partnership, which maintained offices in London, England, and Brisbane, Australia. On HOK Sport's 15th anniversary in November 1998, the firm merged with LOBB. The new practice retained headquarters in all three cities.\n\nThe Kansas City, Missouri, office was first based in the city's Garment District in the Lucas Place office building. In 2005, it moved into its headquarters at 300 Wyandotte in the River Market neighborhood in a new building it designed, on land developed as an urban renewal project through tax incentives from the city's Planned Industrial Expansion Authority. It was the first major company to relocate to the neighborhood in several decades. In March 2009, HOK Sport Venue Event changed its name to Populous after a managers’ buyout by HOK Group.\n\nIn October 2015, Populous relocated to its new headquarters at the newly renovated Board of Trade building at 4800 Main street near the Country Club Plaza in Kansas City.\n\nThe company is one of several Kansas City-based sports design firms that trace their roots to Kivett and Myers which designed the Truman Sports Complex which was one of the first modern large single purpose sports stadiums (previously, stadiums were designed for multipurpose use). Other firms with sports design presence in Kansas City that trace their roots to Kivett include Ellerbe Becket Inc. and HNTB Corp.. 360 Architecture is also based in Kansas City.\n\nPopulous is credited for spearheading a new era of baseball park design in the 1990s, beginning with Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore. At Camden Yards, and in other stadiums built by Populous soon thereafter, such as Coors Field in Denver and Progressive Field in Cleveland, the ballpark was designed to incorporate aesthetic elements of the city's history and older \"classic ballparks.\" Camden Yards's red brick facade emulates the massive B&O Warehouse that dominates the right field view behind Eutaw Street, whereas Progressive Field's glass and steel exterior \"call to mind the drawbridges and train trestles that crisscross the nearby Cuyahoga River.\" Starting with Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati in 2003, a number of Populous Sport's stadiums featured more contemporary and even futuristic designs. Subsequent stadium exteriors featuring this motif opened in Washington and Minnesota.\n\nIn addition to moving away from the concrete exteriors of the \"cookie-cutter\" multi-purpose stadiums that preceded the new parks, Populous incorporated other innovative touches: natural grass playing surfaces (instead of artificial turf), asymmetrical field dimensions, various park-specific idiosyncrasies (like Tal's Hill in Houston), and less foul territory that would keep fans farther from the diamond. And because the stadiums were designed for baseball instead of several sports, the sightlines were \"uniformly excellent.\"\n\nCamden Yards was hugely popular with baseball fans, and its success convinced many cities to invest public funds in their own new ballparks to help revitalize struggling urban neighborhoods. From 1992 to 2012, HOK Sport/Populous were the lead architects on 14 Major League Baseball stadiums and helped renovate four existing stadiums.\n\nPopulous's designs across Major League Baseball have become so prevalent that some critics have asserted that the distinctiveness that was originally found in early \"retro\" ballparks is impossible to maintain: \"There are nearly 20 [new ballparks] around the league, [so] their heterogeneity has come to seem altogether homogenous.\" Whereas \"classic\" ballparks like Fenway Park were given strange dimensions simply because of the limitations provided by the plots of land on which the parks were built, new stadiums do not feature such restrictions. One sportswriter said the attempt to emulate the old parks in this way is \"contrived.\"\n\nIn addition, a number of commentators have criticized what they see as a tendency to cater new ballparks toward wealthier ticket buyers, such as with expanded use of luxury suites instead of cheaper, conventional seating. Several writers have noted that upper deck seating at new ballparks may actually be farther away from the field than in the older parks, partly as a result of these new upper decks being pushed higher by rows of luxury suites.\n\nOne writer in \"The New Yorker\" said it is \"not quite right to credit or blame Populous\" for trends in their new stadiums—as it is ultimately team owners that plan what they want in future stadiums—but they \"certainly enabled\" such changes.\n\nIn early 2018 Populous, together with Madison Square Garden Company, announced plans to construct two grandiose entertainment arenas: Sphere Las Vegas and Sphere London. According to plans, both vast venues will be futuristically designed and equipped with advanced acoustic and visual technologies. While some, including Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, support the development of the London Venue, others are concerned about the feasibility of the plans. Chris Kyriakakis, audio signal processing professor at the Los Angeles USC Viterbi School of Engineering, foresees serious acoustic problems due to the venue's spherical shape. Additional criticism has come from the property industry where claims have been made that the dedicated plot could accommodate up to 1,400 new homes in an area in which there is a shortage of affordable housing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor League Baseball All-Star Game\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22196175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22196175", "title": "Robert Watts (artist)", "text": "Robert Watts (artist)\n\nRobert Watts was an American artist best known for his work as a member of the international group of artists Fluxus. Born in Burlington, Iowa June 14, 1923, he became Professor of Art at Douglass College, Rutgers University, New Jersey in 1953, a post he kept until 1984. In the 1950s, he was in close contact with other teachers at Rutgers including Allan Kaprow, Geoffrey Hendricks and Roy Lichtenstein. This has led some critics to claim that pop art and conceptual art began at Rutgers.\n\nHe organised the proto-fluxus \"Yam Festival\", May 1963 with George Brecht, and was one of the main protagonists, along with George Maciunas, in turning SoHo, New York, into an artist's quarter. He died Friday September 2, 1988 of lung cancer in Martins Creek, Pennsylvania.\n\nHe was also known as Bob Watts or Doctor Bob.\n\nAfter earning a degree in mechanical engineering at the University of Louisville, Watts served as an officer in the United States Navy aboard aircraft carriers. Watts left the Navy and moved to New York in 1948, where he studied art at the Art Students League and later at Columbia University from where he gained a degree in the History of Art, majoring in pre-Columbian and non-Western Art. After becoming Professor of Art at Douglass College, Rutgers University, 1953, he started to exhibit works in a proto-pop style. He participated in Pop Art shows such as \"New Forms, New Media\" exhibition in 1960 at Martha Jackson's Gallery; the \"Popular Image\" exhibition at the Washington Gallery of Art in 1963; and the 1964 \"American Supermarket\" exhibition at New York's Bianchini Gallery, which also featured Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg and Tom Wesselmann. After exhibiting at Leo Castelli's Gallery in 1964, Watts turned his back on the gallery system, and concentrated instead on the anti-art of the emerging New York avant-garde centred around George Maciunas. \n\n\"[His] work obviously related to that of the Pop artists that I had discovered a few years before...Watts' chromed objects closely related to Johns' cast beer cans and flashlights, for instance. The 1964 exhibition also included Watts' sculpture of plaster cast loaves of bread on shelves. That work, in particular, I think of as one of his most important inventions. I'm also particularly fond of the chrome eggs and egg carton in my own collection which will appear in this [posthumous] show. The public will be surprised that an artist -so promising at such an early date- did not receive through the years the appreciation he deserved.\" Leo Castelli\n\nWatts met the artist and chemist George Brecht in 1957 after the latter saw an exhibition of Watts' work and sought his acquaintance; the two would meet for lunch every week, with Kaprow occasionally joining them, for a number of years to discuss art and to plan joint exhibitions. One of the most famous was the proto-fluxus \"Yam Festival\" (1962–3), which used mail-art to build expectations for a month-long series of happenings, performances and exhibitions at Rutgers, New York City and George Segal's farm in New Jersey. Participating artists included Alison Knowles, Ay-O, Al Hansen, Ray Johnson, John Cage, and Dick Higgins. The events ran parallel to George Maciunas' Fluxus Festivals in Europe (Sept 1962-early 1963) -which had already performed some of Watts' event scores in Düsseldorf- and the two events were officially joined when Maciunas published Brecht's event scores as \"Water Yam\", the first of the Flux boxes to be published. Watts' own flux collection, \"Robert Watts Events\" was published a year later and brought together many of the mail art event scores that had been used to publicise the Yam Festival.\n\n\"I consider Yam Lecture a chain of events arranged in such a way that the sequence is quite random, no performance exactly like any other, with changing performers, costumers, actions, sounds, words, images, and so on. The 'structure' is such that it is very flexible (nearly non-existent) and permits inclusion of anything one wished to do and any possible future changes. It is a loose and open thing. The audience puts it together the way it wishes or not at all.\"\n\n\"Similar ideas were at work in Yam Festival which George Brecht and I carried out last year. In effect this was a mailing to an audience, sometimes randomly chosen, of an assortment of things. Some were event cards similar to the above; others were objects, food, pencils, soap, photos, actions, words, facts, statements, declarations, puzzles, etc. Certain ones were by subscription. One might say this way of working is a way or manner of calling attention to what one wishes to talk about; or it is a way of talking about it. Or it is a way to hold up for scrutiny a range of material that ordinarily is not so directly useful for art or has not yet been so considered.\" Robert Watts, quoted in the Times Literary Supplement, 1964\nOne example of Watts' event scores around this point is \"Casual Event\";\n\n—drive car to filling station\n—inflate right front tire\n—continue to inflate until tire blows out\n—change tire*\n—drive home\n\n—*if car is newer model drive home on blown out tire\n\nAccording to Henry Flynt, Maciunas '[begged] Watts not to continue 'Yam' separately from Fluxus. Maciunas was desperate to unite the whole post-Cage movement under his command.'\n\nWatts' friendship with Maciunas was cemented when the latter was confined to a hospital bed throughout May 1963. To cheer him up, Watts sent him \"Hospital Events\" (see ). Maciunas enjoyed the piece so much that he published it as an early \"Fluxbox\"; many of Watts' contemporary event cards were subsequently included in \"Fluxus 1\", 1963, Maciunas' first year box compiling works by the members of the international avant-garde.\n\n\"It must have been Alison Knowles who called me up to say [George Maciunas] was in bad shape with asthma in an Air Force hospital in Germany and needed help or at least some encouragement... I decided to send something for entertainment, so I stuck some pistol caps on the back of old photos from an Italian magazine of WWI vintage. I remember there was a photo of a priest blessing a propeller of an Italian Air Force fighter plane. The idea was to put the photo on an anvil and hit the front with a hammer until all the caps exploded. Later GM said he got a big kick out of this procedure, especially since after he exploded all the caps, he set up the photos' remains for the locals to continue the destruction... he said the people beat the shit out of those photos until there was nothing left but fuzz.\" Robert Watts, 1980\n\nOver the years Watts contributed a number of works to Fluxus including a \"Flux Atlas\", a collection of rocks from different countries, and a \"Flux Timekit\", a series of boxes that housed objects that existed in different time scales, such as seeds to be planted, a time-lapsed photo of a speeding bullet and a pocket watch. He also set up \"Implosions Inc.\" with Maciunas to mass-produce novelty items, and helped run the \"Flux Housing Co-Operative\", an artist-run scheme that is held responsible for the rehabilitation and gentrification of SoHo, offering cheap loft spaces to artists throughout the sixties and seventies. Watts himself was the first resident of the first working Flux Co-Op at 80 Wooster Street. Jonas Mekas' cinematheque and Maciunas' apartment were housed in the same building which soon became the 'central Fluxus loft'. He took part in the notorious \"Flux Mass\", and was one of the very few original artists apart from Maciunas himself to have neither distanced himself from the movement, nor to have been expelled.\n\nReferred to as \"the invisible man of Fluxus and Pop\" by the critic Kim Levin, a term later used as the title of a solo posthumous show in Kassel, Watts remains a 'distant, aloof, and enigmatic' figure. In general his reputation has gradually recovered since the late 90s, although not without comments on some of the works' perceived sexism. As individual members of Fluxus have increasingly been singled out for re-appraisals, Watts work has been seen in a number of solo and small group shows across the USA and Europe.\n\n'There is something impersonal or phlegmatic in Watts's composition, a deliberately flattened sense of timing. This aspect of his work has not aged as gracefully as have his concerns with commodity and its absurdities. A puckish wit remains where media and message are crisply meshed, as in Portrait Dress, 1965, a see-through vinyl frock with pockets for photographs, or the suite of neon signs in which the signatures of masters like Ingres, Duchamp, and Lichtenstein glow like ads. Other items in this show appeared dated, such as the Lucite sculptures with embedded photographs of food, or the painted plaster casts of bread lined up in a grayscale row, but this was largely because their semiotic jokesterism has been so wholly assimilated by successors that it cannot startle now as it did then.' Frances Richard, 2001\n\nHis work is held in numerous collections, including The Museum of Modern Art, New York City, Whitney Museum of American Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, The Art Institute of Chicago, The Philadelphia Museum of Art, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, J. Paul Getty Museum, Kunsthaus Zurich, and Tate Modern, London.\n\n\n"}

However, its stylistic features are essentially common to the European Romanesque, and in the particular differentiated between areas that usually subdivided. The southern half of the peninsula lacks of Romanesque art since remained under Muslim rule (Andalusi art). The Romanesque in the central area of the peninsula is low and late, with virtually no presence at south of the Ebro and the Tagus; It is the northern third peninsular the area where are concentrated the Romanesque buildings. In view of the fact that the Romanesque is introduced into the peninsula from east to west, for the purposes of its study, the regional delimitation is done in the same direction: in \"eastern kingdoms\" (the kingdoms or Pyrenean areas: Catalan Romanesque, Aragonese Romanesque and Navarrese Romanesque), and \"western kingdoms\" (Castilian-Leonese Romanesque, Asturian Romanesque, Galician Romanesque and Portuguese Romanesque).\n\nThe First Romanesque or Lombard Romanesque has especially presence in Catalonia, while the full Romanesque spread from the foundations of the Order of Cluny along the axis of Camino de Santiago. The late-romanesque continues in the 13th century, especially in rural buildings.\n\nFrom the 11th century the European artistic influence (especially Burgundian - Cluny - and Lombard monasteries - Lombard arches -) was superimposed on local artistic traditions ( called as \"Pre-Romanesque - Visigothic art, Asturian art, Mozarabic art or Repoblación art) and Andalusi art or Hispanic Muslim) and lived with the so-called Mudéjar Romanesque (or \"Romanesque of brick\", dominant in some areas, such as the center of the Northern Plateau -from Sahagún to Cuéllar-, Toledo or Teruel) giving rise to an art of strong personality.\n\nThe chronology in the penetration of architectural forms is visible in a display from east to west, being the first examples in Catalonia (Sant Pere de Rodes, 1022) and developed around Camino de Santiago those of Aragon (Cathedral of Jaca, from 1054), Navarre (Leire, 1057), Castile (San Martin de Frómista, 1066) and Leon (San Isidoro -portico of 1067), ending in Galicia, where it raised the most outstanding work: the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela (begun in 1075 with the plant of pilgrimage characteristic of most of the churches of the Way, from that of St. Sernin of Toulouse). The 12th century was the culmination of the style (Monastery of Ripoll, churches of Boí and Taüll -in Catalonia-, Castle of Loarre, Monastery of San Juan de la Peña -in Aragon, Palace of the Kings of Navarre (Estella), Done Mikel eliza (Estella-Lizarra), Saint Mary of Eunate, Saint Peter of Olite -in Navarre-, Segovian arcaded churches, Santo Domingo (Soria), San Juan de Duero -in Castile-, Cathedral of Zamora, Old Cathedral of Salamanca -in Leon-). From the late 12th is identified the transition from Romanesque to Gothic (Cathedral of Tarragona, La Seu Vella (Lleida)).\n\nFew, but notable are the churches of central plant, which are often associated with models of the Holy Land brought by the military orders (Eunate in Navarre, Vera Cruz in Segovia).\n\nThe earliest works of the Romanesque sculpture in the Hispanic-Christian peninsular kingdoms are two beam of the Roussillon area Saint-Génis-des-Fontaines (dated in 1020) and Sant Andreu de Sureda (which plays its forms). Also from the 11th century are the tympanum of the Cathedral of Jaca, the gables of San Isidoro (León), the Facade of Pratarías of Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela (the Master Esteban), the cloister of Santo Domingo de Silos. In the 12th century emphasizes the facades of Santa Maria de Ripoll, of the Andre Maria erreginaren eliza (Zangoza/Sangüesa) of the San Pedro el Viejo (Huesca) and the cloister of Monastery of San Juan de la Peña. In the late 12th century belong the facades of the Church of Santa María del Camino (Carrión de los Condes) and Santo Domingo (Soria). In some works of this period is visible the transition to Gothic: the apostolate of the Cámara Santa (Oviedo), the facade of San Vicente (Ávila) and Portico of Glory of Cathedral of Santiago de Cosmpostela (of Master Mateo). Another of the early sculptors of known name is Arnau Cadell (capitals of the cloister of Sant Cugat).\n\nThe carvings in the round bulge that have been preserved, in polychrome wood, usually have as theme the Christ crucified in the type called \"Majesty\" and the Madonna with Child in the type called \"sedes sapientiae\" (\"Seat of Wisdom\"). An exceptional sculpture complex is the \"Davallament of Sant Joan de les Abadesses\", of transition to the Gothic.\n\nThe Spanish Romanesque frescoes are outstanding: Pantheon of the Kings of San Isidoro (León) retained 'in situ', or the torn from its places of origin (San Baudelio de Berlanga, hermitage of la Vera Cruz (Maderuelo) -both in the Prado- and the collection assembled in the National Art Museum of Catalonia).\n\nThe panel painting produced antependium that, especially in Catalonia collected the Italian-Byzantine influence from the 12th century (\"Altar frontal from La Seu d'Urgell or of The Apostles\"). In later period it evolves to the Gothic painting, of higher capacity narrative and lower stiffness (\"Altar frontal from Avià\").\n\nThe preparation of manuscripts in the \"scriptorium\" of monasteries and cathedrals was an out-standing activity, continuing the Mozárabe tradition (Beatus) and incorporating the European influences (\"Libro de los testamentos\", \"Tumbos compostelanos\", \"Codex Calixtinus\", etc.) have been retained some outstanding examples of tissues in liturgical vestments and tapestries (\"Tapestry of Creation\" of the Cathedral of Girona) The Ivory carving, of Andalusian influence, played an important workshop at the Leonese court. The goldsmith produced rich pieces (\"Cáliz de las Ágatas \" or of Doña Urraca -ca 1063-, \"Ark of San Isidoro\"), including the incorporation of the technique of the Limoges enamels (\"Frontal of Santo Domingo de Silos\").\n\n"}
{"id": "762968", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=762968", "title": "Templon", "text": "Templon\n\nA templon (from Greek τέμπλον meaning \"temple\", plural \"templa\") is a feature of Byzantine churches consisting of a barrier separating the nave from the sacraments at the altar.\n\nThe solid templon first appeared in Christian churches around the 5th century and is still found in many Eastern Christian churches. Initially it was a low barrier probably not much different from the altar rails of many Western churches. It eventually evolved into the modern iconostasis, still found in Orthodox churches today.\n\nIt is usually composed of carved wood or marble colonnettes supporting an architrave (a beam resting on top of columns). Three doors, a large central one and two smaller flanking ones, lead into the sanctuary. The templon did not originally obscure the view of the altar, but as time passed, icons were hung from the beams, curtains were placed in between the colonnettes, and the templon became more opaque. In modern Orthodox churches, it is common for the openings of the templa to be constructed specifically to contain icons.\n\nThe templon most likely has an independent origin from that of Latin chancel barriers. Classical stage architecture is one possible source. At certain times during Byzantine history, theater heavily influenced painting and sculpture. Architects then, influenced by stage backdrops dating back to Sophocles, consciously imitated the classical \"proskenion\" (Latin proscenium; the backdrop of a classical Greek stage), copying the multiple columns punctuated by a large door in the middle and two smaller doors to each side. The statues on top of the backdrop would thus be analogous to the icons of the saints looking down. The similarities, however, are probably only visual. Although classical drama was performed in Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, during the 5th and 6th century when the first templa appear, when Christian liturgy was first being developed, the plays and their architecture had lost their importance and could not have influenced Christian ritual.\n\nA much more plausible theory is that the templon models, in both form and content, the decorative wall of the Torah screen in Jewish synagogues of the 2nd and 3rd centuries. These, too, had three main divisions: a central door leading to the altar, smaller flanking passages, and a distribution of parts similar to a templon. The Torah screen was probably not the direct prototype of the templon; it probably derives from the imitation of the Torah screen in the altar of a typical Syrian pagan temple.\n\nA direct comparison can also be made to the layout of the great Temple of Jerusalem. The most sacred and innermost portion, known as the Holy of Holies, was where the Ark of the Covenant was kept. This room was separated from the larger part of the main building's interior by a large curtain, the \"veil of the temple\". Only the High Priest was allowed to enter the Holy of Holies, and only once a year on Yom Kippur. The third part was the entrance court. This architectural tradition for the two main parts can be seen carried forward in Christian churches and is still most demonstratively present in Eastern Orthodox churches where the iconostatsis divides the altar, the Holy of Holies containing the consecrated Eucharist - the manifestation of the New Covenant, from the larger portion of the church accessible to the faithful. In Orthodox Christian tradition, with the exception of churches at women's monasteries, only men with good cause may enter the altar portion behind the iconostasis.\n\nBarriers called templons in Greek were also used on occasions when the Roman Emperors appeared in public, to segregate the Imperial retinue from the crowd.\n\n\"Templon\" is a loan word in Greek, from the Latin \"templum\", \"temple\"; how and why it came to have its present meaning is unclear. The most obvious explanation is that the form of the templon resembles a pagan temple. The steps up to the apse (semicircle where the altar is located) are analogous to the stereobate and stylobate of the temple (the floor of a temple). The colonnettes arranged in the π shape resemble the columns that surround all four sides of a temple, the architrave looks like the architrave on a temple, and the carved disks on the architrave are analogous to the metopes on the entablature. \n\nHowever, it has also been suggested that the name templon derives not from the pagan temples but from the Christian idea of the shrine where God was worshipped, or more specifically the Temple in Jerusalem.\nIn almost all modern European languages, the word \"templon\" is a direct and late borrowing of the Greek architectural term, and it is rarely found outside the academic usage; besides the Greek \"templon\", another direct descendant of the Latin \"templum\", having the same architectural meaning, is the Romanian word \"tâmplă\", \"iconostasis\".\n\nArchaeological evidence for an early templon comes from the Cathedral of St. John at Stoudios in Constantinople, a basilica dedicated to John the Baptist, built around 463. The chancel barrier surrounded the altar in a π shape, with one large door facing the nave and two smaller doors on the other sides. Twelve piers held chancel slabs of about 1.6 meters in length. The height of the slabs is not known. The chancel barrier was not merely a low parapet (a short wall); remains of colonnettes have been found, suggesting that the barrier carried an architrave on top of the columns.\n\nMany fragments of a marble templon have been discovered on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.\n\nThough there is some architectural and archaeological evidence of early templa, the first and most detailed description of a templon comes from a poem by Paul the Silentiary, describing Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. It was composed near the end of Justinian I’s reign and was probably recited on Epiphany, January 6, 563, celebrating the reinauguration of the church after the reconstruction of the great dome.\n\nHagia Sophia’s templon surrounded, according to Paulus, \"such space as was reserved in the eastern arch of the great church for the bloodless sacrifices\". That is, it stretched the length of the eastern semidome, including the apse but excluding the exedrae (half-dome recesses in a wall). Twelve silver-covered marble columns of approximately 4.94 meters from base to capital were arranged on three sides of a rectangular ground plan around the altar. A horizontal entablature rested upon these. Three doors allowed entry to the apse, the central one larger than the other two. Though earlier scholars have proposed that all columns and all doors were in a single line parallel to the apse, modern reconstructions show the central portal facing out to the nave with the smaller doors each located on the other sides of the rectangular plan.\n\nIn between the columns were slabs of marble covered in silver about 1.00 to 1.10 meters tall. On them had been carved the monograms of Justinian and Theodora (6th century), even though Theodora had been dead for several years, as well as a many-armed cross in the center. On the center of the architrave was a repoussé medallion of Christ. On either side of Him were medallions of angels, the Prophets, the Apostles, and finally the Virgin Mary. The carvings on the architrave were deeply tied to the liturgy. Another templon roughly contemporary to Hagia Sophia’s is that of the church to St. John of Ephesus, rebuilt by Justinian as a domed crucifix. There was an inscription to St. John the Theologian over a side door, since the crypt of the saint was within the enclosed sanctuary. St. John the Baptist was probably carved over the other door of the templon of Hagia Sophia, since he features prominently in liturgical writings of the church.\n\nIn any case, the majority of templa followed the same basic design. They were usually carved of monochrome marble, though some, like Hagia Sophia’s, were covered in precious metals and others used polychrome marbles. The slabs were often carved with vegetal or animal patterns and the architraves with busts of God, the Virgin, and the saints. Figurative decoration on the templon was mainly concentrated on the architrave, initially with carved busts. This continued from the time of Justinian into the middle Byzantine period, as shown from a 10th-century excavation in Sebaste in Phrygia, which uncovered a marble templon whose epistyle is covered with busts of saints. There is evidence that icons were hung from the columns of the templon prior to iconoclasm. Nicephorus I, Patriarch of Constantinople from 806 to 815 describes portable icons hung from columns and the gate of the templon in his \"Antirretikoi\". Important portable and colossal icons were also placed in front of the templon, as in the 11th-century church of Saint Panteleimon in Nerzei.\n\nThe templon gradually replaced all other forms of chancel barriers in Byzantine churches in the 6th, 7th, and 8th centuries except in Cappadocia. As late as the 10th century, a simple wooden chancel barrier separated the apse from the nave in the rock-cut churches, though by the late 11th century, the templon had become standard. This may have been because of the veneration and imitation of the Great Church Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, though the columnar form of chancel barrier does predate Hagia Sophia.\n\nThe templon began to change forms to the medieval templon with the attachment of icons and painted scenes to the architrave. Some of the best preserved of these images are from the Saint Catherine's Monastery on Mount Sinai in Egypt. The late 12th-century templon beam shows twelve canonical feast scenes, with the Deesis (Christ enthroned, flanked by Mary and St. John the Baptist) located in the middle between the Transfiguration and the Raising of Lazarus, linking the scene of Lazarus with the Holy Week images according to liturgical practice. Several epistyles of this form have been excavated throughout the empire, none earlier than the 12th century, indicating a change from busts on the architrave to scenic decoration. This new scenic style is representative of the increasing liturgification in Byzantine representational art after iconoclasm.\n\nDuring most of the Middle Byzantine period, the space between the colonnettes was not filled with icons but with curtains. Nicholaos Andidorum describes in his \"Protheoria\" \"the shutting of the doors and the closing of the curtain over them\". The most widespread image on the medieval templon seems to have been the Deesis. Its popularity arose from not only its simplicity and elegance, suggesting the efficacy of prayer and the threat of the Last Judgment, but also because it could be easily adapted to the patron’s tastes with the addition of secondary scenes and characters, as in the Saint Catherine's Monastery where scenes from the life of St Eustratios appear on either side of the Deesis on a templon beam. Proskynetaria (large icons) also played a major part in the decoration of the medieval templon, either as monumental images placed on the piers flanking the templon or as portable images in front of the screen. Proskynetaria of both these types still exist in Cyprus, from Lagoudera, now in the Archbishop’s Palace in Nicosia, and in St Neophytos.\nSometime between the 11th and 14th centuries, icons and proskynetaria began to be placed in the intercolumnar openings on the templon. After the reconquest in 1261, carving on the medieval templon approached sculpture in the round. From this period, the first wood-carved templa, or iconostases, were produced. They for most part had a fixed program of icon decoration with three levels: the Local, the Deesis, and the Festival tiers. Early Russian versions were at chest height, and called \"thoraxis\" in Greek.\n\nThe full height iconostasis became standard in the 15th century, and probably owes more to 14th-century Hesychast mysticism and the wood-carving genius of the Russians than anything else. The first ceiling-high, five-leveled Russian iconostasis was designed for the Cathedral of the Annunciation in Moscow Kremlin by Theophanes the Greek in 1405, and soon copied by his assistant Andrey Rublyov in the Cathedral of the Dormition in Vladimir in 1408.\n\nThis is a list of known churches which retain their templon. Some have had icons placed inside, and others are modern reconstructions of the original Templon.\n\n\nPhotos of existing templon within churches.

It is the story of a love triangle between a doctor who specialises in sleep and aging research and a vampire couple. The film is a loose adaptation of the 1981 novel of the same name by Whitley Strieber, with a screenplay by Ivan Davis and Michael Thomas, and is Scott's feature directorial debut.\n\nThe film was screened out of competition at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nMiriam Blaylock (Catherine Deneuve) is a vampire, promising specially chosen humans eternal life as her vampire lovers. As the film begins, her companion is John (David Bowie), a talented cellist whom she married in 18th century France. In a night club in New York, they connect with a young couple who they bring home and feed upon by slashing their throats with a bladed Ankh pendant. The bodies are disposed of by an incinerator in the basement of John and Miriam's elegant New York townhouse, where they pose as a wealthy couple who teach classical music.\n\nApproximately 200 years after his turning, John begins suffering insomnia and ages years in only a few days. John realizes Miriam's promise that periodically killing and feeding upon human victims would give him immortality was only partially true: he will have eternal life but not eternal youth. He seeks out Dr. Sarah Roberts (Susan Sarandon), a gerontologist, alongside her boyfriend Tom (Cliff De Young), who specialises in the effects of rapid aging in primates, hoping she will be able to reverse his accelerating decrepitude. Sarah assumes that John is a hypochondriac or mentally unbalanced and ignores his pleas for help. As John leaves the clinic in a rage, Sarah is horrified to see how rapidly he is aging. John rebuffs her once she tries to help him.\n\nOne of the Blaylocks' students, Alice Cavender (Beth Ehlers), drops by their townhouse to say that she cannot attend the next day's lesson. In a last attempt to regain his youth, John murders and feeds upon Alice, whom Miriam was grooming to be her next consort when she came of age, to no avail. John begs Miriam to kill him and release him from the agony of his decrepit body. Weeping, Miriam tells him there is no release. After John collapses in the basement, Miriam carries him into the attic full of coffins and places him in one. Like John, Miriam's former vampire lovers suffer an eternal living death, helplessly moaning and trapped in their coffins. Later, a police official comes to the residence, looking for the missing Alice. Miriam feigns ignorance and claims that her husband is in Switzerland.\n\nSarah comes looking for John at his home but only finds Miriam, who now feels alone after losing both John and Alice. The two have a sexual encounter, during which Miriam bites her arm and some of Miriam's blood enters Sarah's body. Miriam attempts to initiate Sarah in the necessities of life as a vampire, but Sarah is repulsed by the thought of subsisting on human blood.\n\nSarah returns home and goes out to dinner with Tom, who becomes argumentative about her 3-hour disappearance at the Blaylock residence, of which she is strangely quiet. The next day at the lab, the team investigates Sarah's blood by Tom's authority and reveal she has some kind of infection that is taking over. Confused, Sarah returns to confront Miriam about her sudden changes. Still reeling from the effects of her vampiric transformation, Sarah allows Miriam to put her to bed in a guest room.\n\nTom arrives on Miriam's doorstep, trying to find Sarah. Miriam shows him to the upstairs bedroom. Sarah, starving and desperate, kills Tom. Miriam assures her that she will soon forget what she was. As the two kiss, Sarah drives Miriam's ankh-knife into her own throat and holds her mouth over Miriam's, forcing Miriam to ingest her blood, possibly working on a hunch regarding the \"blood borne metabolic aging disease\" and \"host\" relationship she was told about affecting her blood. Miriam carries Sarah upstairs, intending to place her with her other boxed lovers. A rumbling occurs and the mummies of Miriam's previous lovers - including John - emerge from their coffins, driving her over the edge of the balcony. As she rapidly ages, the mummies become dust, ostensibly providing the trapped souls with release.\n\nThe police investigator returns to find a real estate agent showing the townhouse to prospective buyers. Sarah is now in London, standing on the balcony of a chic apartment tower, admiring the view as dusk falls. From a draped coffin in a storage room, Miriam repeatedly screams Sarah's name.\n\n\nThe final scene of Sarah on the balcony was added at the studio's behest, with a view to leaving the film open-ended and allowing for possible sequels. Sarandon later expressed regret that this sequence seemed to make no sense in the context of the rest of the film: \"The thing that made the film interesting to me was this question of, 'Would you want to live forever if you were an addict?' But as the film progressed, the powers that be rewrote the ending and decided that I wouldn't die, so what was the point? All the rules that we'd spent the entire film delineating, that Miriam lived forever and was indestructible, and all the people that she transformed [eventually] died, and that I killed myself rather than be an addict [were ignored]. Suddenly I was kind of living, she was kind of half dying... Nobody knew what was going on, and I thought that was a shame.\"\n\nBowie was excited to work on the film but was concerned about the final product. He said \"I must say, there's nothing that \"looks\" like it on the market. But I'm a bit worried that it's just perversely bloody at some points.\"\n\nHoward Blake was musical director on \"The Hunger\". Although a soundtrack album accompanied the film's release (Varèse Sarabande VSD 47261), this issue omits much of the music used in the film. Blake also composed the orchestral score for \"Flash Gordon\" (1980) alongside rock band Queen and the Oscar-winning animated short film of Raymond Briggs', \"The Snowman\" (1982).\n\nBlake's notes on working with director Tony Scott: \"Tony wanted to create a score largely using classical music and I researched this, many days going to his home in Wimbledon with stacks of recordings to play to him. One of these was the duet for 2 sopranos from Delibes' \"Lakmé\", which I recorded specially with Elaine Barry and Judith Rees, conducting my orchestra The Sinfonia of London. Howard Shelley joined with Ralph Holmes and Raphael Wallfisch to record the second movement of Schubert's Piano Trio in E flat. Ralph recorded the Gigue from Bach's Violin Partita in E and Raphael the Prelude to Bach's solo cello sonata in G, to which Bowie mimed. I was persuaded to appear in one scene as a pianist, for which I wrote a 'Dolphin Square Blues'. Tony wanted to add a synthesizer score and I introduced him to Hans Zimmer, then working at The Snake Ranch Studio in Fulham but Tony eventually used a score by Michel Rubini and Denny Jaeger with electronics by David Lawson. It is hard however to exactly separate these elements.\"\n\n\"The Hunger\" received mixed reviews upon its release and was particularly criticised for being heavy on atmosphere and visuals but slow on pace and plot. Roger Ebert, of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", described the film as \"an agonizingly bad vampire movie\". He remarked that the sex scene between Deneuve and Sarandon is effective, but that the film is so heavy on set design and scene cuts that any sense of a story is lost. In a brief review in \"Rolling Stone\", Michael Sragow similarly called it \"A minor horror movie with a major modern-movie problem: director Tony Scott develops so many ingenious ways to illustrate his premise that there's no time left to tell a story.\" The critic Camille Paglia wrote in \"Sexual Personae\" (1990) that while \"The Hunger\" comes close to being a masterpiece of a \"classy genre of vampire film\", it is \"ruined by horrendous errors, as when the regal Catherine Deneuve is made to crawl around on all fours, slavering over cut throats.\" Elaine Showalter called \"The Hunger\" a \"post-modernist vampire film\" that \"casts vampirism in bisexual terms, drawing on the tradition of the lesbian vampire...Contemporary and stylish, [it] is also disquieting in its suggestion that men and women in the 1980s have the same desires, the same appetites, and the same needs for power, money, and sex.\"\n\nThe film has found a cult following that responded to its dark, glamorous atmosphere. The Bauhaus song \"Bela Lugosi's Dead\" plays over the opening scene and credits. The film is popular with some segments of the Goth subculture and inspired a short-lived TV series of the same name although the series has no direct plot or character connection to it. \"The Hunger\" was nominated for the Saturn Awards for Best Costume and Best Make-up. It holds a 48% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 29 reviews.\n\nOn 23 September 2009, Warner Bros. announced it planned a remake of the film, with the screenplay written by Whitley Strieber.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "57644876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57644876", "title": "The Waltz (Claudel)", "text": "The Waltz (Claudel)\n\nThe Waltz (French: \"La valse\") or The Waltzers (French: \"Les valseurs\") is a sculpture by French artist Camille Claudel. It depicts two figures, a man and a woman, locked in an amorous embrace as they dance a waltz. The work was inspired by Claudel's burgeoning love affair with her mentor and employer Auguste Rodin. Various versions were made from 1889 to 1905, initially in modelled in plaster, and later cast in bronze. Examples are held by the Musée Rodin and the Musée Camille Claudel.\n\nClaudel was studying with Alfred Boucher in Paris when she was first introduced to Rodin in 1883, when she was aged 19. She joined his studio around 1884, where she assisted him with ongoing works such as his \"Gates of Hell\" and \"Burghers of Calais\". She also worked on her own sculptures under Rodin's guidance. They quickly fell into a passionate romantic relationship. Claudel became increasingly frustrated with Rodin's unwillingness to break away from his long-term mistress, Rose Beuret, and their love affair ended in 1892. \n\nClaudel and Rodin continued to work together until 1898, but their relationship deteriorated irretrievably after Rodin saw her transparently autobiographical sculpture \"The Mature Age\", which depicts a young woman pleading with her older lover to leave his female companion.\n\nClaudel began working on \"The Waltz\" in about 1889, while her relationship with Rodin was still passionate. As originally conceived, the work depicts two naked dancers, a man and a woman, in a dance hold, frozen at a moment in time in their amorous embrace. The woman's head rests tenderly on the man's right shoulder, with their bodies fluidly merging into a single shape as the man turns his head towards the woman's face as if to kiss her. \n\nClaudel continued to work on the subject for several years, eventually seeking a public commission to create a half-life-size marble version. Her plaster model of the sculpture was reviewed in 1892 by the art critic Armand Dayot, who was working as an inspector for the French Ministry of Beaux-Arts. In his report to the ministry, he praised the sensuality and expression of the work, and the modelling of the figures, but concluded that it was not acceptable for public display due to the indecency of the naked dancers. \n\nIn response to Dayot's comments, Claudel reworked the sculpture, draping the lower half of the female figure with a flowing skirt which billows out with the twisting movement of the waltzing dancers, and curled around the dancer's heads. Dayot reviewed the amended plaster model in 1893: he was impressed with the sense of movement added by the drapery, and supported the new work, known as \"La valse avec voiles\" (\"The waltz with veils\"). He described it as \"un gracieux enlacement de formes superbes balancées dans un rythme harmonieux au milieu de l'enveloppement tournoyant des draperies\" (\"a gracious intertwining of superb shapes balanced in an harmonious rhythm among swirling drapes\"), concluding that Claudel was an artist with great talent.\n\nClaudel exhibited this revised plaster model in 1893 at the Paris Salon of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, but the minister Henry Roujon deemed it unacceptable for a woman to be given a public commission which included a naked man. Despite support from Rodin, the ministry declined to commission a marble version.\n\nEmulating Rodin's reuse of figures from earlier sculptures in his later works, Claudel adapted the female figure from \"The Waltz\" as the figure of \"Fortune\" in her 1904 bronze cast.\n\nThe original plaster version was bought by the founder and in 1893 produced in a single bronze cast of this first version of \"The Waltz\", sometimes known as \"La valse avec voiles\". \n\nClaudel worked on modified versions of \"The Waltz\" from 1895 to 1898, removing the drapery around the dancers' heads to make their faces visible. Claudel made several versions of this modified sculpture, with slightly differing poses, and presented sculptures to several of her friends and acquaintances, including Claude Debussy, Robert Godet and Frits Thaulow.\n\nThe founder and art dealer bought the rights to reproduce the sculpture from Siot-Decauville around 1902, and also bought the unique bronze cast of the first version. Blot sold the this case, and it was held in a private collection in Sweden until the 1950, and then another collection until sold at Sotheby's in June 2013, for £5,122,500. Blot also made bronze casts of the second version in 1905; he envisioned an edition of 50, but only 25 were made.\n\nIn addition to the bronzes, other examples exist, including a green-glazed stoneware version, one of four versions exhibited together at the Musée Camille Claudel at Nogent-sur-Seine near Paris\n\nSeveral examples have been sold at auction in recent years, with prices increasing considerably.\n\n"}

{"id": "3759130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3759130", "title": "V. Shantaram", "text": "V. Shantaram\n\nShantaram Rajaram Vankudre (18 November 1901 – 30 October 1990), referred to as V. Shantaram or Shantaram Bapu, was a Marathi Indian filmmaker, film producer and actor. He is most known for films such as \"Dr. Kotnis Ki Amar Kahani\" (1946), \"Amar Bhoopali\" (1951), \"Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje\" (1955), \"Do Aankhen Barah Haath\" (1957), \"Navrang\" (1959), \"Duniya Na Mane\" (1937), \"Pinjra\" (1972), \"Chani\", \"Iye Marathiche Nagari\" and \"Zunj\".\n\nV. Shantaram started his film career doing odd jobs in Maharashtra Film Co. owned by Baburao Painter at Kolhapur. He went on to debut as an actor in the silent film \"Surekha Haran\" in 1921.\n\nShantaram, fondly known as Annasaheb, had an illustrious career as a filmmaker for almost six decades. He was one of the early filmmakers to realize the efficacy of the film medium as an instrument of social change and used it successfully to advocate humanism on one hand and expose bigotry and injustice on the other. V. Shantaram had a very keen interest in music. It is said that he \"ghost wrote\" music for many of his music directors, and took a very active part in the creation of music. Some of his songs had to rehearsed several times before they were approved by V. Shantaram.\n\nHe directed his first film \"Netaji Palkar\", in 1927. In 1929, he founded the Prabhat Film Company along with Vishnupant Damle, K.R. Dhaiber, S. Fatelal and S.B. Kulkarni, which made \"Ayodhyecha Raja\", the first Marathi language film in 1932 under his direction. He left Prabhat co. in 1942 to form \"Rajkamal Kalamandir\" in Mumbai. In time, \"Rajkamal\" became one of the most sophisticated studios of the country.\n\nHe was praised by Charlie Chaplin for his Marathi film \"Manoos\". Chaplin reportedly liked the film to a great extent.\n\nShantaram introduced his daughter Rajshree (his daughter by Jayashree) and Jeetendra in the 1964 film \"Geet Gaya Patharon Ne\". That was the debut film for both of them. He also introduced his second wife Sandhya's niece Ranjana Deshmukh into the Marathi film industry through \"Chandanachi Choli Ang Ang Jaali\", directed by his son Kiran Shantaram in 1975. Ranjana dominated the Marathi silver screen in the 70s and 80s.\n\nThe Dadasaheb Phalke Award was conferred on him in 1985. He was awarded the Padma Vibhushan in 1992.\n\nHis autobiography \"Shantarama\" was published in Hindi and Marathi.\nThe V. Shantaram Award was constituted by Central Government and Maharashtra State Government. The V. Shantaram Motion Picture Scientific Research and Cultural Foundation, established in 1993, offers various awards to film-makers. The award is presented annually on 18 November. A postage stamp dedicated to Shantaram was released by India Post on 17 November 2001.\n\nShantaram was born in 1901 at Kolhapur to a Marathi family with a Jain father and Hindu mother. In 1921, aged 20, he married 12-year-old Vimalabai, a girl of his own community and similar background, in a match arranged by their families in the usual Indian manner. Their marriage lasted their entire lives and its relationships of harmony and mutual support survived even his subsequent two marriages, which were concurrent with his first. Vimalabai bore four children, being son Prabhat Kumar (after whom Shantaram named his movie company) and daughters Saroj, Madhura and Charusheela. Shantaram's second daughter Madhura is the wife of Pandit Jasraj and mother of music director Shaarang Dev Pandit and of TV personality Durga Jasraj. Shantaram's third daughter, Charusheela, is the mother of Hindi and Marathi actor Sushant Ray a.k.a. Siddharth Ray.\n\nOn 22 October 1941, Shantaram (aged 40) married the actress Jayashree (née Kamulkar), with whom he had fallen in love while they worked together in several films, including \"Shakuntala\" (1942) which ran for 104 weeks in Mumbai. Jayashree became Shantaram's second wife, and was received with traditional ceremonies by his first wife Vimalabai. Until January 1957, it was perfectly legal (and in keeping with ancient custom) for Hindu men to have more than one wife at a time, and it was typical for the wives to live harmoniously together in the same household. Jayashree bore Shantaram three children – one son, the Marathi film director and producer Kiran Shantaram, and two daughters, Rajshree (the actress) and Tejashree. Shantaram's six children grew up playing and bonding with each other. The two wives also had a cordial relationship and often interacted with each other, although they maintained separate houses. Vimalabai was strongly bonded with Shantaram's extended family; she would be at her husband's side at all religious and family finctions that they attended, and she would be hostess whenever they themselves hosted such functions. On the other hand, Jayashree would accompany Shantaram to all events and functions connected with the film industry and the film profession and at any parties he hosted for the film fraternity.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Shantaram grew close to another of his leading ladies, the actress Sandhya (née Vijaya Deshmukh), who was his co-star in many films like \"Do Aankhen Barah Haath,\" \"Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje\", \"Navrang\", \"Jal Bin Machhli Nritya Bin Bijli\" and \"Sehra\". Vimalabai did not have much contact with Shantaram's professional associates and took Sandhya in her stride, but the case was different with Jayashree, who came to regard Sandhya as an ambitious gold-digger who was using the middle-aged Shantaram for her own purposes, to become a successful actress at his expense and riding on his shoulders. Things came to a head during the making of \"Do Aankhen Barah Haath,\" a film which Shantaram was producing and which featured him and Sandhya in the main roles. Shantaram ran short of money while making the film, and asked his wives to give him their jewellery so that he could mortgage the same and raise funds to get over the cash crunch. The jewellery would be redeemed and returned to the ladies after the movie was completed, he said. Vimalabai agreed without fuss and handed over her jewellery, but Jayashree did not, apparently because she suspected that the jewellery would end up in Sandhya's possession. This led to a misunderstanding between the couple. Later, Jayashree realized that money was indeed the problem and that in fact, even Sandhya had parted with her jewels in order to help Shantaram. When she came to know this, Jayashree felt bad that she was the only person to have retained her jewellery. On some minor occasion (a birthday), she tried to make amends by gifting some of her jewellery to Sandhya, so that the latter could have some jewels at least. However, Sandhya declined the gift by saying that she had lately stopped wearing jewellery. Jayashree took offence at the snub and the rift between the ladies grew. It became clear that they would not be able to live harmoniously together the way Vimalabai and Jayashree were living. It also became clear that there existed a widening rift between Jayashree and Shantaram also.\n\nFinally, Shantaram and Jayashree were divorced on 13 November 1956. This was one of the earliest divorces to be granted in India, because it happened only weeks after parliament passed a law making it possible for Hindus to get a divorce; previous to this, divorce had been literally impossible for Hindus. According to Shantaram's daughter by Vimalabai, neither Shantaram not Jayashree could ever forget each other in later life and both of them deeply regretted that the parting of ways.\n\nHardly a month after the divorce, on 22 December 1956, Shantaram married Sandhya. This marriage was also legally valid because the law which forbade bigamy for Hindu men would come into effect only on 1 January 1957; it was therefore one of the last bigamous marriages to be conducted among Hindus in India. Sandhya had met Vimalabai many times before her wedding, and when the wedding was being finalized, she told Vimalabai that she would only marry Shantaram if Vimalabai not only gave her willing consent but also permitted her to stay in the same house with her. Touched by Sandhya's humility, goodness and traditional values, Vimalabai wholeheartedly gave her consent. She performed the traditional ceremonies and received her new co-wife into her household. The two ladies lived together harmoniously in the same house not just during Shantaram's lifetime but even after his death. Vimalabai and Sandhya enjoyed a close and cordial relationship with each other, which was enhanced because of the large age difference between them, because of their common values of \"pativratha sanskar,\" and also because it was known from the beginning that Sandhya would never bear children. This was because Shantaram had undergone an operation after the birth of Jayashree's third child, which left him incapable of begetting further progeny. Sandhya had been informed of this fact and had accepted it knowingly, which earned her great respect in her new home and put to rest all the speculation about her being a gold-digger. She would often say in Marathi “Hey sagle majhe mula aahet (all these are my kids)\" indicating Shantaram's seven children. Sandhya treated Vimalabai with great respect at all times, and Vimalabai looked upon Sandhya with deep affection. In the professional field, Sandhya worked exclusively with her husband and refused all film offers made by other film-makers. She starred in some of Shantaram's biggest hits like \"Do Aankhen Barah Haath,\" \"Navrang,\" \"Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baje\" and \"Pinjra.\"\n\nShantaram died on 30 October 1990 in Mumbai. He was survived by all three of his wives. Even his second wife Jayashree, who was divorced from him, attended his funeral rites, participated in the rituals, and took to wearing the garb of a widow thereafter, thus indicating that the piece of legal paper which constituted their divorce was only a paper. Vimalabai and Sandhya continued to reside together in one house along with Vimalabai's son Prabhat and his wife and children. Vimalabai, passed away in 1996 after being bedridden for four years. Sandhya lives today in the care and company of Vimalabai's children, especially of Prabhat and his family.\n\nShantaram used to live at Panhala near Kolhapur in Maharashtra state. His daughter Saroj has maintained his house and has converted it into a hotel named Valley View.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: IMDB\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
