Common in the western world, for example, are statues of Lady Justice representing justice, traditionally holding scales and a sword, and the statues of Prudence, representing Truth by holding a mirror and squeezing a serpent. \n\nThis approach of using human form and its posture, gesture and clothing to wordlessly convey social values and themes.\nIt may be seen in funerary art as early as 1580. They were used on renaissance monuments when patron saints became unacceptable. Particularly popular were the four cardinal virtues and the three Christian virtues, but others such as fame, victory, hope and time are also represented. The use of allegorical sculpture was fully developed under the École des Beaux-Arts. It is sometimes associated with Victorian art, and is commonly found in works dating from around 1900.\n\n"}

The series is based on the \"Arabian Nights\", a classic work of Middle Eastern literature.\n\nOnce a peaceful country, Persia was overrun by the powerful forces of the evil conqueror Bakaar the Black Sultan. When all the states of Persia were overthrown, Bakaar invaded the capital city of Baghdad. Bakaar and his forces breached the royal palace and forcibly claimed the throne from Prince Turhan and ordered the prince to be killed. Prince Turhan fled the palace, pursued by the guards of Bakaar. In his escape, the prince is helped by a magician named Fariik, who, with his magic, slipped away from the guards. On their way to the state of El-Rabaul to seek aid from his uncle the Caliph, Turhan and Fariik meet Raseem while being chased by the guards in the Caves of Doom. Raseem tells them that Bakaar's forces have already usurped the throne of El-Rabaul and imprisoned the Caliph and his daughter, Princess Nida. The trio then heads to El-Rabaul on Zazuum, Raheem's donkey.\n\nIn El-Rabaul they rescue Princess Nida, who is about to be sold into slavery. There, Princess Nida demonstrates her mastery of disguise and voice mimicry by tricking the guards, but they soon find themselves cornered by Bakaar's men. There Bez jumps into the scene, shapeshifts into an elephant, charges through the guards, and carries everyone to safety. In the Caves of Doom, they decide to form a heroic band and swear to protect their land from the tyranny of Bakaar, thus forming an alliance called the Arabian Knights.\n\n\"Arabian Knights\" was one of several animated miniseries used as filler segments for Hanna-Barbera's \"Banana Splits Adventure Hour\" show. Each episode ran between 9 and 10 minutes in length. For the most part, it competed with the other series, namely the animated \"The Three Musketeers\", the part live action, part animated \"Micro Ventures\", and the live action \"Danger Island\" segments.\n\nOften, the general thrust of the \"Arabian Knights\" adventures deals with the Knights trying to effect some action against Bakaar’s soldiers, finding a means to further complete their goal of turning the tables on the evil dictator, or dealing with another villain set within the Knights' universe.\n\nFor the most part, these adventures were done with a semi-serious slant, with a goodly portion of action and comedy mixed in. Hardly anyone was injured or harmed—save for Bakaar's minions (with a usually comic effect), and the episodes usually had an upbeat, happy ending for the Knights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2474449", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2474449", "title": "Bespoke tailoring", "text": "Bespoke tailoring\n\nBespoke tailoring is clothing made to an individual buyer's specifications by a tailor. \n\nThe word \"bespoke\" is derived from the verb \"bespeak\", to speak for something, in the specialised meaning \"to give order for it to be made\". The term bespoke in fashion is reserved for individually patterned and crafted men's clothing, analogous to women's haute couture, in contrast with mass-manufactured ready-to-wear (also called off-the-peg or off-the-rack). The term originated from Savile Row, a street in London considered the \"Golden Mile of tailoring\".\n\nBespoke clothing is traditionally cut from a pattern drafted from scratch for the customer, and so differs from ready-to-wear, which is factory made in finished condition and standardised sizes, and from made to measure, which is produced to order from an adjusted block pattern. The opposition of terms did not initially imply that a bespoke garment was necessarily well built, but since the development of ready-to-wear in the beginning of the twentieth century, bespoke clothing is now more expensive and is generally accompanied by a high quality of construction.\n\nWhile the distinction conferred by haute couture is protected by law in France, the British Advertising Standards Authority has ruled it is a fair practice to use the term \"bespoke\" for products that do not fully incorporate traditional construction methods. The Savile Row Bespoke Association, a trade group of traditional tailors, disagrees.\n\nBetween the extremes of bespoke and ready-to-wear, there has existed since the end of the 19th century a \"grey area of garments for which the customer was measured, but that were then made up to the closest standard size, often, but by no means always, in a factory.\" The distinction made here is between bespoke, created without use of a pre-existing pattern, and made to measure, which alters a standard-sized pattern to fit the customer. Technological change makes this distinction more subtle, since fittings are increasingly required for made-to-measure. A bespoke service may require an individually-cut pattern, which is then kept should further suits be required; made-to-measure measurements are often stored on a computer. Even hand-work, often cited as a benchmark of bespoke, is now increasingly found in made-to-measure garments, while machine-making plays some part in the creation of most bespoke suits. With a bespoke suit, a pattern is designed and made from scratch based on the client's measurements, often from 20+ measurements involving multiple fittings, and takes considerably longer to produce than a made-to-measure garment. This ensures a precise fit, particularly in the shoulders as well as the posture areas. This custom fit is handy for clients with short or long necks, high or low shoulders, excess girth, high hips, large or flat seats, and more. Made-to-measure cannot adjust for these shapes and slopes.\n\nIn addition, new technologies have allowed for bespoke garments to be made with lean manufacturing practices and digital patterning, making new patterns within minutes and fully bespoke garments in hours, at a price point similar to made to measure or even mass production.\n\nIn June 2008, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), a British advertising regulator, ruled that an advertisement describing a suit \"put into a 'working-frame' where it would be cut and sewn by machine\" as a \"bespoke suit uniquely made according to your personal measurements & specification\" was not breaching the Authority's self-proclaimed advertising codes, notably the truthfulness rule, because the use of the term bespoke was not deemed likely to confuse. The ruling was significant in formalising a less traditional definition of bespoke clothing, even though the older distinction with made-to-measure was recognised.\n\nThe ruling cited the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" definition of bespoke as \"made to order\", and considered that despite the fact a bespoke suit was \"fully hand-made and the pattern cut from scratch, with an intermediary baste stage which involved a first fitting so that adjustments could be made to a half-made suit\", while a suit made-to-measure \"would be cut, usually by machine, from an existing pattern, and adjusted according to the customer's measurements\", \"both fully bespoke and made-to-measure suits were \"made to order\" in that they were made to the customer's precise measurements and specifications, unlike off-the-peg suits\".\n\nSome, such as the etymologist Michael Quinion, considered the ruling showed that \"the historic term of art had moved on\". Some others concluded that \"bespoke tailoring has traditionally, if unofficially, meant something more than the dictionary definition allows\" and that the ASA \"took a rather ignorant decision to declare that there is no difference between bespoke and made-to-measure.\"\n\n\n"}

Book retailers such as the Borders Group have failed to adjust to these changes, thus there has been a steep decline in the number of operating traditional and independent bookshops. However, still heavily influential on the trade globally, British publishers such as Penguin Books and Pearson remain dominant players within the industry and continue to publish titles gloablly.\n\nBy the 14th century a commercial book trade had been established in the UK, and before printing was introduced to Europe by Johannes Gutenberg in 1439 the trade consisted of scribes who wrote manuscripts. By the early 15th century the majority of those engaged in these activities were situated in London and belonged to a trade guild called the Company of Stationers.\nBy the 16th century publishers and printers controlled the book trade and introduced a commercial aspect, relying for much of their income on the sales of popular religious books, almanacs, prognostications and similar literature.\nBy the 20th century, as literacy became increasingly universal within society and disposable income increased, publishers were faced with new opportunities. In 1900 the Net Book Agreement was introduced to ‘help to maintain a chain of stock holding bookshops while giving the publishers sufficient confidence to publish new titles’\n\nThe introduction and demise of the Net Book Agreement heavily impacted the publishing industry. First established in 1900, the Act involved an agreement between booksellers and publishers to fix the price of books in order to \"help maintain a chain of stock holding bookshops while giving the publishers sufficient confidence to publish new titles\"\n\nThe structure of the industry within the UK has altered significantly over the last few decades, which now establishes itself as part of wider industry globally dominated by international giants such a Pearson (UK), Muse Corporation (United States), and Hachette (France). The gap between small independent booksellers and giant chain sellers has vastly increased, leading to the dissolution of many medium-sized companies; \"Overall the number of significant companies has dropped by ten percent in the last decade\". \nTechnology has extensively affected developments within the publishing industry. Due to having one of the highest levels of internet connectivity in Europe, the industry in the UK experiences the prevalent threat and the vast opportunity of revolutionary technological advances such as the e-book and Amazon; almost all book publishers in the UK now utilize the standard book number.\n\nBookshops have begun to decline over the years, with just over 73 closures in 2013 alone, the UK lost 7% of its remaining Independent book stores. The number of independent book shops has now fallen below 1,000 (2014) whilst even bigger booksellers such as Borders went into liquidation.\n\nIn 2013 the publishing contributed to the UK creative economy with 231,000 jobs that had an almost equal split between men and women.\n\nFrom 2014, brick and mortar shops have been performing better, seeing a light at the end of the Recession period and the boom of the Kindle. Looking at the data provided, Richard Mollet, chief executive of The Publishers Association, explains that \"those who ever tried to maintain that this was a binary choice have been shown to have been posing the question in the wrong way. It is not a question of either physical or digital winning out, but rather of the sector coalescing around a balanced marketplace where all formats have place. While publishing has been efficient and effective in its adaptation, the underlying driver of the evolution is of course the reader. What the 21st-century consumer desires above all is choice. As long as publishers can give readers the option of paper or screen, the market will - and is - taking care of itself. The ebook is no more a challenge to the lifespan of paper than television is to the theatre\".\n\nUK publishers of online, publicly accessible open access books include Open Book Publishers, Ubiquity Press, and UCL Press.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Alternatively, it has been used to describe the ideological-aesthetic aspect of contemporary corporate capitalism in the West. When used in this way, it is a play on the term \"socialist realism\".\n\nAlthough attested earlier, the phrase \"capitalist realism\" was first used in the title of the 1963 art exhibition in Düsseldorf, \"Demonstration for Capitalist Realism\", which featured the work of Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, Wolf Vostell, and . The exhibition's participants focused upon depictions of Germany's growing consumer culture and media-saturated society with strategies, in part, influenced by those of their American Pop counterparts. The recent rise in Pop Art in German culture was coupled by a fascination with America, which served as a stimulation for the piece. They were inspired primarily by the iconography depicted in newspapers and magazines.\n\nCapitalist realism is a German art movement co-founded in 1963 by artist Sigmar Polke. Polke embraced the advertising and publicity commonly found in the popular press in renderings of everyday consumer items. Often ironic and with critical overtones of society and politics the Capitalist Realism movement is considered more explicitly political than conventional Pop Art.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Michael Schudson used the term \"capitalist realism\" to describe mainstream practices in advertising. Chapter seven of Schudson's \"Advertising: The Uneasy Persuasion\" compares the messages and appeals of advertising to those found in the Socialist Realism of the Soviet Union. In his account, the realism of advertising promotes a way of life based on private consumption, rather than social, public achievement.\n\nThe term next appeared in 2009 with the publication of Mark Fisher's book \"\" Fisher argues that the term \"capitalist realism\" best describes the current global political situation, which lacks visible alternatives to the capitalist system which became dominant following the fall of the Soviet Union. His argument is a response to, and critique of, neo-liberalism and new forms of government which apply the logic of capitalism and the market to all aspects of governance.\n\nHis ideology refers to a perceived \"widespread sense that not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system, but also that it is now impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative to it\". \n\nAs a philosophical concept, capitalist realism is influenced by the Althusserian conception of ideology. Fisher proposes that within a capitalist framework there is no space to conceive of alternative forms of social structures, adding that younger generations are not even concerned with recognizing alternatives. He proposes that the 2008 financial crisis compounded this position. Rather than catalyzing a desire to seek alternatives for the existing model, the crisis reinforced the notion that modifications must be made within the existing system. The crash confirmed within the populace the necessity of capitalism rather than shake it loose from its foundations.\n\n\"Capitalist realism as I understand it cannot be confined to art or to the quasi-propagandistic way in which advertising functions. It is more like a pervasive atmosphere, conditioning not only the production of culture but also the regulation of work and education, and acting as a kind of invisible barrier constraining thought and action.\"\n\nFisher argues that capitalist realism has propagated a 'business ontology' which concludes that everything should be run as a business including education and healthcare.\n\nFollowing the publication of Fisher's work, the term has been picked up by other literary critics.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2388402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2388402", "title": "Capitoline Museums", "text": "Capitoline Museums\n\nThe Capitoline Museums (Italian: \"Musei Capitolini\") is a single museum containing a group of art and archaeological museums in Piazza del Campidoglio, on top of the Capitoline Hill in Rome, Italy. The historic seats of the museums are Palazzo dei Conservatori and Palazzo Nuovo, facing on the central trapezoidal piazza in a plan conceived by Michelangelo in 1536 and executed over a period of more than 400 years. The history of the museums can be traced to 1471, when Pope Sixtus IV donated a collection of important ancient bronzes to the people of Rome and located them on the Capitoline Hill. Since then, the museums' collection has grown to include a large number of ancient Roman statues, inscriptions, and other artifacts; a collection of medieval and Renaissance art; and collections of jewels, coins, and other items. The museums are owned and operated by the municipality of Rome.\n\nThe statue of a mounted rider in the centre of the piazza is of Emperor Marcus Aurelius. It is a copy, the original being housed on-site in the Capitoline museum. \n\nOpened to the public in 1734 under Clement XII, the Capitoline Museums are considered the first museum in the world, understood as a place where art could be enjoyed by all and not only by the owners.\n\n\"This section contains collections sorted by building, and brief information on the buildings themselves. For the history of their design and construction, see Capitoline Hill#Michelangelo.\"\n\nThe Capitoline Museums are composed of three main buildings surrounding the Piazza del Campidoglio and interlinked by an underground gallery beneath the piazza.\n\nThe three main buildings of the Capitoline Museums are:\n\n\nIn addition, the 16th century Palazzo Caffarelli-Clementino, located off the piazza adjacent to the Palazzo dei Conservatori, was added to the museum complex in the early 20th century.\n\nThe collections here are ancient sculpture, mostly Roman but also Greek and Egyptian.\n\nFeatures the relief from the honorary monument to Marcus Aurelius.\n\nThe second floor of the building is occupied by the Conservator's Apartment, a space now open to the public and housing such famous works as the bronze she-wolf nursing Romulus and Remus, which has become the emblem of Rome. The Conservator's Apartment is distinguished by elaborate interior decorations, including frescoes, stuccos, tapestries, and carved ceilings and doors.\n\nThe third floor of the Palazzo dei Conservatori houses the Capitoline Art Gallery, housing the museums' painting and applied art galleries. The Capitoline Coin Cabinet, containing collections of coins, medals, jewels, and jewelry, is located in the attached Palazzo Caffarelli-Clementino.\n\nStatues, inscriptions, sarcophagi, busts, mosaics, and other ancient Roman artifacts occupy two floors of the Palazzo Nuovo.\n\nIn the Hall of the Galatian can also be appreciated the marble statue of the \"Dying Gaul\" also called “Capitoline Gaul” and the statue of \"Cupid and Psyche\". Also housed in this building are:\n\nThe Galleria Congiunzione is located beneath the Palazzo dei Conservatori and the piazza itself, and links the three palazzos sitting on the piazza. The gallery was constructed in the 1930s. It contains \"in situ\" 2nd century ruins of ancient Roman dwellings, and also houses the Galleria Lapidaria, which displays the Museums' collection of epigraphs.\n\nThe new great glass covered hall — the \"Sala Marco Aurelio\" — created by covering the Giardino Romano is similar to the one used for the Sala Ottagonale and British Museum Great Court. The design is by the architect Carlo Aymonino. Its volume recalls that of the oval space designed by Michelangelo for the piazza.\n\nIts centerpiece is the bronze equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius, which was once in the centre of Piazza del Campidoglio and has been kept indoors ever since its modern restoration. Moving these statues out of the palazzo allows those sculptures temporarily moved to the Centrale Montemartini to be brought back. It also houses the remaining fragments of the bronze Colossus of Constantine and the archaeological remains of the tuff foundations of the temple of Capitoline Jupiter, with a model, drawn and computer reconstructions and finds dating from the earliest occupation on the site (in the mid Bronze Age: 17th-14th centuries B.C.) to the foundation of the temple (6th century BC).\n\nIn the three halls adjacent to the \"Appartamento dei Conservatori\" are to be found the showcases of the famous Castellani Collection with a part of the set of Greek and Etruscan vases that was donated to the municipality of Rome by Augusto Castellani in the mid-19th century.\n\nThe Centrale Montemartini is a former power station of (active as a power-station between the 1890s and 1930s) in southern Rome, between Piramide and the basilica of San Paolo Fuori le Mura, close to the Metro station Garbatella. \nIn 1997, the Centrale Montemartini was adapted to temporarily accommodate a part of the antique sculpture collection of the Capitoline museums, at that time closed for renovation; the temporary exhibition was so appreciated that the venue was eventually converted into a permanent museum. \nIts permanent collection comprises 400 ancient statues, moved here during the reorganisation of the Capitoline Museums in 1997, along with tombs, busts, and mosaics. Many of them were excavated in the ancient Roman horti (e.g. the Gardens of Sallust) between the 1890s and 1930s, a fruitful period for Roman archaeology. They are displayed there along the lines of Tate Modern, except that (unlike there) the machinery has \"not\" been moved out.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8190595", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8190595", "title": "Contemporary Tibetan art", "text": "Contemporary Tibetan art\n\nContemporary Tibetan art refers to the art of modern Tibet, or Tibet after 1950. It can also refer to art by the Tibetan diaspora, which is explicitly political and religious in nature. Contemporary Tibetan art includes modern thangka (religious scroll paintings) that resemble ancient thangka, as well as radical, avant-garde, works.\n\nFor more than a thousand years, Tibetan artists have played a key role in the cultural life of Tibet. From designs for painted furniture to elaborate murals in religious buildings, their efforts have permeated virtually every facet of life on the Tibetan plateau. The vast majority of surviving artworks created before the mid-20th century are dedicated to the depiction of religious subjects, for the most part being distemper on cloth or murals. They were commissioned by religious establishments or by pious individuals for use within the practice of Tibetan Buddhism and were manufactured in large workshops by uncredited artists. These works not only document spiritual concepts but also demonstrate the vitality of Tibetan aesthetics over the centuries in terms of the cross-fertilisation of stylistic influences from other Chinese, Nepalese, and Indian styles.\n\nHistorical Tibetan art followed a formal system of art making that was used to spread Tibetan religious culture. However, in 1950, the People's Republic of China gained sovereignty over Tibet while still granting autonomy to the area. This changed the social reality of life in Tibet, and modern Tibetan artists use their work as a mode of self-expression and exploration of their new, complex national identity. Contemporary Tibetan artwork often conflicts with traditional artwork commissioned for religious purposes, and identity was largely tied to place, family lines, Tibetan language, and Tibetan Buddhism, with art serving as the transmission of the religion. However, Tibetan art after 1950 raises questions of how globalization effects national and cultural identity, the conflict between tradition and modernity, and the influence of religion in a more secular age.\n\nGonkar Gyatso is a Tibetan-born British artist, born in 1961 during the Cultural Revolution. He studied \"thankga\" (scroll painting) in India before returning to Tibet in 1985, when he established the Sweet Tea House Contemporary Gallery, the first avant-garde artists association in Tibet. \n\nGyatso's work incorporates pencils and stickers on paper using the technique of the Tibetan thankga. He applies kitsch stickers to penciled images of the Buddha, and often adds commentary in speech bubbles. These colorful children's stickers often take the form of characters from American movies and media, such as The Simpsons and Spiderman, creating a cheap, consumerist appearance that contrasts with the meticulous and deliberate nature of their application. These images draw the viewer's attention to the conflict between the meditative and spiritual aspects of Buddhism and worldly materialism. Gyatso draws on his training in traditional art techniques to create work that explores Western consumer interests, the relationship between capitalism and culture, as well as the conflict between tradition and modernity, spirituality and materialism, and religion and secularism. \n\n"}

Joyce was found surrounded by wrapped Christmas gifts and with her TV still switched on, having remained undiscovered since December 2003. Due to advanced decomposition, the cause of death was unable to be determined.\n\nThe film features interviews with various friends, acquaintances and former partners in an attempt to tell the story of Joyce, who is played in reconstructions by Ashton.\n\nDirector Carol Morley was inspired to make the documentary on Joyce's life after reading an article on her that failed to mention her age, race or any detailed information. She tracked down interviewees by taking out ads in newspapers and hiring a cab to drive around London asking people to contact her if they knew Joyce. She was surprised to learn that many of the respondents did not know Joyce was dead until she spoke to them even though some of them remembered hearing of her death when it was reported on in newspapers.\n\nMorley was criticized for an extended fictionalized sequence that featured Zawe Ashton as Joyce performing \"A Smile is Just a Frown\". She stated that she was inspired to keep the sequence in the film by a similar sequence in Agnès Varda's \"Cléo from 5 to 7\" and also credited Varda's documentary work with inspiring much of her movie.\n\nMorley was also in contact with Joyce's four sisters, all of whom refused to be in the film. Although they asked Morley not to make the film, she went ahead with production, but gave them an advance screening in order to show that she had been respectful in remembering their sister.\n\nThe film received a rating of 62 on aggregate movie review website Metacritic and 70% on Rotten Tomatoes, indicating an overall positive reception.\n\nSteven Wilson's album \"Hand. Cannot. Erase.\" was inspired by his viewing of the movie.\n\n"}
{"id": "4289431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4289431", "title": "Ekkyklema", "text": "Ekkyklema\n\nAn ekkyklêma (; ; \"roll-out machine\") was a wheeled platform rolled out through a \"skênê\" in ancient Greek theatre. It was used to bring interior scenes out into the sight of the audience. Some ancient sources suggest that it may have been revolved or turned.\n\nIt is mainly used in tragedies for revealing dead bodies, such as Hippolytus' dying body in the final scene of Euripides' play of the same name, or the corpse of Eurydice draped over the household altar in Sophocles' \"Antigone\". Other uses include the revelation in Sophocles' \"Ajax\" of Ajax surrounded by the sheep he killed whilst under the delusion that they were Greeks. The \"ekkyklêma\" is also used in comedy to parody the tragic effect. An example of this is in Aristophanes' \"Thesmophoriazusae\" when Agathon, portrayed as an effeminate, is wheeled onstage on an \"ekkyklêma\" to enhance the comic absurdity of the scene.\n\n"}
{"id": "32782057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32782057", "title": "Emily Fields", "text": "Emily Fields\n\nEmily Catherine Fields is a fictional character created in 2006 by author Sara Shepard. She is a character of both \"Pretty Little Liars\" books and television series, and initially appears as a \"jock girl\" and one of the main protagonists of the stories. She is part of the group known as the Liars; and is best friend to the four other members, whose are also protagonists. Emily is known for her description and shyness, as well as for being member of a conservative family, the Fields.\n\nEmily's characteristics and stories have the same methodology in both books and television. However, there are some perceptual differences between the two versions, since the television series usually doesn't follows the books' scripts. As an example, Emily's parents on the screen have different names from the books ones; and, in the books, she has siblings, while in the television series she doesn't. Another noticeable difference between the two versions are the physical and psychological characteristics.\n\nFor her portrayal, Mitchell was nominated twice in the Teen Choice Awards.\n\n\"Pretty Little Liars\" is a series of novels which follows the lives of four teenage girls nicknamed the Pretty little Liars or simply the Liars, whose clique falls apart after the disappearance of their queen bee leader, Alison DiLaurentis. Three years after her disappearance, the girls begin receiving threatening messages from an anonymous character named \"A\", who threatens to expose their secrets, including long-hidden ones they thought only Alison knew. Shortly after the messages begin, Alison's body is discovered buried in her yard. The books progress with the four girls trying to figure out who \"A\" is and facing many dangerous obstacles and twists.\n\nIn the first book, Emily is introduced as loyal, sweet girl who struggles with her sexuality. She is described as having hazel eyes and a strawberry-blonde hair that is tinted green due to chlorine. At her school, Emily is recognized by the students for her achievements in swimming. Emily is largely motivated by matters surrounding family, romance, and ambition. Emily is also superstitious, although most of her superstitions are unique only to her; for example, making a wish at \"4:56\" instead of \"\".\n\nEmily was a friend of Alison DiLaurentis and deeply attracted to her. She dated a boy named Ben Coogan before realizing her true feelings were for girls. She falls for and secretly dates Maya St. Germain. When \"A\" outs Emily to the whole school, her parents force her to go to Tree Tops, a \"de-gaying\" rehabilitation center. Failing that, Emily is shipped off to Iowa to live with relatives; deeply unhappy there, she runs away. Her parents ask her to come home, stating that they will learn to accept Emily for who she is. Emily comes to discover that she's actually bisexual, when she falls for and eventually sleeps with a boy named Isaac Colbert. Although they break up soon after, Emily learns she's pregnant and secretly gives the baby up for adoption during summer break. As a senior in high school, she accidentally meets Kelsey, a girl who Spencer framed for drug possession the past summer; Emily ends up falling for her, but the relationship is ended when Kelsey attempts suicide.\n\nIn \"Burned\", while on a school-hosted cruise for spring break, Emily begins a new relationship with Jordan, a criminal who is on the run and being pursued by the FBI. On a tip from \"A\"/Alison, Jordan is arrested and set to prison. She is later murdered by someone paid by Alison, who had Jordan killed out of revenge for \"stealing\" Emily from her. Severely depressed and increasingly desperate, Emily contemplates committing suicide and very nearly attempts it; she is only talked out of it when the Liars remind her that that is what Alison wants: for them to die.\n\nIn the last book, Emily and the other Liars are later put on trial after Alison fakes her own death and frames them for it (setting it up to look like the Liars took revenge on Alison for everything she did to them). Emily, unbeknownst the other Liars, fakes her own suicide in order to trick Alison. Emily tracks down Alison and Alison's mother, who are in hiding, and after a confrontation with them, is able to expose them as criminals. After Alison's trial, she moves out to California and begins a new relationship with a girl named Laura, finally feeling at peace.\n\nHaving fallen in love with Alison in seventh grade, frequently fantasizes about Alison still being alive and loving Emily back. Emily admits to being somewhat obsessed with Alison, priding herself on knowing everything about her. For a brief period of time, when Alison comes back as \"Courtney\", the two have a romantic relationship; Emily is heartbroken when Alison reveals it was all a lie. Unbeknownst to the other girls, Emily attempted to save Alison from the DiLaurentis' burning Poconos house. She feels tremendous guilt over her actions, especially so after Alison once again returns as \"A\". However, eventually Emily begins to hate Alison; Jordan's death at Alison's hands sends Emily into a spiral of rage and deep depression. Following Jordan's death, Emily swears revenge on Alison and remarks that she would not mind killing Alison.\n\nEmily's closest friends are the other Liars, and during the periods when they are not associating with one another, Emily is very lonely. She is quite popular at school, but feels as though she's not close with anyone. She is constantly searching for a \"best friend\" to take Alison's place. Though she is well-liked by the other Liars, they are often annoyed by how sensitive she is and her devotion to Alison, especially Spencer. Emily's insistence that Alison is alive often causes problems for them as a group. Her relationship with her family is strained, predominantly due to her bisexuality and \"A\" related events. She ended up severing ties with her family at the end of the series.\n\nShay Mitchell was cast in the role of Emily Fields in a regular capacity in December 2009. Mitchell had initially auditioned for the role of Spencer and then tried for Emily.\n\nIn the television adaption, Emily's personality is almost the same as her book counterpart. She is the jock of the group and participates in competitive swimming. In the show, she is of Irish/Scottish, Korean and Filipino descent, with long dark hair and brown eyes, and her dress style is more fashionable. In addition, she is a lesbian, and has not been shown to be superstitious. She eventually takes off the friendship bracelet Alison gave to her in an attempt to let go of her feelings for Alison.\n\nEmily was a former student at Rosewood High School in Rosewood, Pennsylvania, a star and a non-competitive swimmer. A year prior to the start of the series, Emily had been best friends with Alison DiLaurentis (Sasha Pieterse), a cruel popular girl who went missing one day. At the beginning of the school year, Emily befriends a girl named Maya St. Germain (Bianca Lawson), her new next-door neighbor whose family has moved into the old DiLaurentis house. Emily and Maya instantly bond, and the next day they kiss when Emily walks her home. With the appearance of \"A\", it is revealed that Emily is questioning her sexuality and may have been in love with Alison. After Maya stays over Emily's house for a night, Ben (Steven Krueger), Emily's boyfriend, senses that Emily is losing interest in him; he attempts to rape her in the school locker room, but is stopped by Toby (Keegan Allen). Grateful and not wanting to deal with her homosexuality, Emily grows closer to Toby, despite the warnings of her friends, who believe him to be \"A\"/Alison's killer.\n\nEmily goes with Toby to Homecoming, much to the dismay of her friends; Emily later admits to Toby that she really wanted to come with Maya. Convinced by her friends that Toby is dangerous, the two get into a physical confrontation; as Emily tries to run away, she trips and hits her head, falling unconscious. Toby drops her off at the hospital in Rosewood, which convinces Emily that he is innocent. When a tornado warning traps everyone inside the high school, Emily finds herself haunted by memories of Alison. That day, she is outed by Detective Darren Wilden (Bryce Johnson), who accuses her of destroying Alison's memorial in the park (when, in reality, Emily had been trying to salvage what she could from the wreckage). Emily tearfully confesses to her friends that she was in love with Alison; although surprised, they are instantly accepting of her being a lesbian. \"A\" later mails Emily's mother (Nia Peeples) a copy of the same picture of Emily and Maya kissing. Although devastated, she doesn't confront Emily about it, instead later showing it to Emily's father (Eric Steinberg) when he returns home from his tour of duty in Afghanistan.\n\nToby comes to visit Emily to prove that he is innocent, but when cats is arrested, he believes that she is responsible for it. Believing that Emily and Toby were involved romantically, Emily's father confronts her about it; after denying that anything is going on, she ends up coming out to her father, who is shocked. Emily's relationship with her parents soon becomes very strained due to the truth about her sexuality, although her parents attempt to accept her by inviting Maya over to dinner. Although Emily's father soon warms to Maya, Emily's mother tells her that she is disgusted by Emily being gay. Believing Maya has corrupted Emily, she is able to have Maya sent away to \"True North\", a camp for juvenile delinquents, which causes Emily and her mother's relationship to suffer even more.\n\nWhen Emily re-joined the school's swim team after a brief injury, she finds herself in a rivalry with Paige McCullers (Lindsey Shaw), an excellent swimmer who had taken Emily's place in her absence. A title from an episode, If at First You Don't Succeed, Lie, Lie Again Highly competitive, Paige lashes out at Emily with homophobic insults, later even physically threatening her. Soon after, however, Paige apologizes to Emily, explaining that she was jealous of how \"easy\" Emily's life seemed. After Paige's homophobic and demanding father accuses Emily of getting preferential treatment, Emily's mother stands up to him, which helps to repair the relationship between Emily and her mother. Paige apologizes for her father later that evening and comes out to Emily by kissing her. Having grown close despite their rocky start, Emily and Paige begin to secretly date. They break up when Emily expresses dissatisfaction with having to hide their relationship and after Paige gets jealous seeing a girl from another school, (Claire Holt), flirting with Emily. Emily's father is sent to Fort Hood in Killeen, Texas, to help with military training, and Emily's mother reveals to Emily that they are moving down to Texas to join him. Emily is dismayed, feeling as though she has only just begun to fit in at Rosewood.\n\nEmily recalls a memory from the day Alison went missing: Alison visited her and gave her a snow globe, which, unbeknownst to Emily at the time, contained a key to a storage locker. Realizing Alison had hidden something away, the girls use the key to discover a series of videos that Ian Thomas had filmed. Believing that Ian is A/Alison's killer, the girls make plans to confront him. Their plans go astray when A kills Ian and take his body from the crime scene, leaving the police suspicious of Emily and her friends.\n\nHoping to convince her mother to stay in Rosewood, Emily considers faking a letter from a college swim scout; deciding it would be wrong, she rips up the letter. However, A makes an unaltered, undamaged copy and sends it to Emily's mother. Emily is able to stay in Rosewood, but feels guilty, confiding in Samara, her new girlfriend. When Emily's mother moves to Texas, Emily goes to live with Hanna.\n\nA concludes that Emily is the \"weak link\" in the group and begins to torment her as much as possible. That, combined with the added stress and guilt from the fake college letter, lands Emily in the hospital with a stomach ulcer. While there, it is revealed that \"A\" secretly dosed Emily with HGH, forever ruining Emily's chances of getting a swimming scholarship. Emily then reunites with Maya, who is now living a few towns over; they both decide to take things slow and see if they are interested in rekindling their relationship.\n\nEmily and the other girls plot to try and trick \"A\" by pretending Emily is being frozen out of the group. The plan is only moderately successful; however, the girls are able to get access to A's phone. Meanwhile, Emily is forced to deal with her new relationship with Maya, who is desperate to avoid getting sent back to True North. Emily later finds out that she couldn't go back because her soon-to-be killer was there and wanted Emily to go with her to San Francisco to save her. When Emily rejects leaving, Maya disappears. Emily believes Maya has run off to San Francisco to stay with some friends, and is distraught. She attempts to find Maya, to no avail. Things are soon complicated by Paige; having recently come out, she hopes to rekindle her and Emily's relationship. Emily's father returns to Rosewood briefly to attend a father-daughter dance. He later tells Emily that he has been assigned on another tour in Afghanistan. After his departure, Emily's mother makes plans to return home to Rosewood.\n\nWith the girls charged with the challenge of unmasking \"A\" at the school's masquerade ball, Emily is on edge. At the ball, she meets Paige; the two talk and come to the mutual agreement that for now, they will be just friends. After Mona (Janel Parrish) is revealed to be \"A\" and subsequently arrested, Emily and the other girls come home to find the police at Emily's house. Emily's mother explains that Maya has been murdered and her body found at the DiLaurentis house. Upon hearing this, Emily breaks down, comforted by the other girls.\n\nNow a senior, Emily has spent the last five months away from her friends, helping build houses in Haiti as well as partying and drinking heavily to the point of blackouts. She is still depressed over Maya's death, but is at the same time angry at being treated like she is \"made out of glass\". When the Liars reunite after their time apart, Emily goes missing during the night and is later found by the other girls standing over Alison's dug-up grave, unable to remember the events leading up to that point. Realizing it is a set-up, the Liars create an alibi for themselves and cover their tracks. Emily's guilt over what happened distances her even more from the Liars, and she finds comfort in Nate St. Germain (Sterling Sulieman), Maya's cousin, who has recently moved to Rosewood to attend Hollis.\n\nIn \"That Girl is Poison\" Emily discovers that her flask had been drugged with a sleeping pill, causing her to black out. In \"Stolen Kisses\", she learns that on the night she was drunk, she had visited Paige, kissing her before leaving. Paige feels guilty about what happened, believing she took advantage of her, and Emily is shocked and confused about this new revelation. That evening she returns to Paige's house and explains that she realized there was a reason she ended up at Paige's house when she was drunk: she wanted to be with Paige. The two kiss, rekindling their relationship.\n\nEmily becomes depressed after watching old videos of Maya on Maya's website, but is cheered up by Paige. In \"What Lies Beneath\", Emily and Hanna discover that Maya had been hiding in Noel Kahn's (Brant Daugherty) family's cabin, and had never actually left Rosewood. Upset by this, Emily and Nate comfort one another, only to end up kissing. She confesses to Paige about kissing Nate, who explains that Emily is simply confused over her connection to Maya through Nate. Emily then rebuffs Nate's further romantic advances, stating that she just wants to be friends.\n\nWhen the Liars suspect Paige of being \"A\" in the mid-season finale, \"The Lady Killer\", Emily steps in to defend her, putting up a wall between herself and the other girls. Stressed over the Liars' constant insistence of Paige's guilt and Garrett's upcoming trial, Emily joins Nate for the weekend at a secluded cabin in the woods. However, after being warned to \"get out\" by \"A\", Emily discovers that Nate was in fact at True North with Maya; Nate admits that his real name is Lyndon James. Angry at Emily for \"taking\" Maya from him, Lyndon reveals he has kidnapped Paige and plans to murder her in front of Emily. Emily escapes, but is caught by Lyndon in a nearby lighthouse while attempting to call 911. During the ensuing struggle, Emily stabs Nate, fatally wounding him. She then reconciles with the other Liars when they realize Paige is innocent.\n\nEmily starts to struggle to know if Alison is alive or not. She takes some pills from her mother's medicine cabinet and gets drowsy and groggy, and causes an injury during a swim meet which put her out of action. The situation gets worse when someone calls Social Services to her parents in an attempt to get her away from them, which does not happen. In addition, Emily's mother is suspended from work because Emily stole a key from Pam's desk in order to invade Officer Wilden's office to find evidence about Alison, and the P.D. ends up blaming Pam for that. Shortly after, \"A\", driving a car, goes through her house, leaving her and her mother no other option but to rent a motel. Later, Jessica DiLaurentis (Andrea Parker) offers Emily Alison's old room to stay temporarily. Emily stays in the DiLaurentis house for a while until she moved to Spencer's, due to the house's creepiness. Throughout the season, Emily, Hanna and Spencer start to investigate Ezra in order to discover if he is or not \"A.\" In the season finale, Alison appears and they finally get some answers about the night Ali disappeared.\n\nWith Alison back in Rosewood, Emily gets supportive and protective of her. She befriends newcomer (Chloe Bridges) and becomes her swimming coach. However, Emily discovers Sydney is a friend of Jenna and breaks all ties with her. Alison apologizes for the way she treated Emily in the past, and they kiss; however, any possibility of romance is squashed when Emily starts to think that Alison is \"A.\" Emily and Paige rekindle their romance, which is rapidly ended when Paige is forced to move to California. Lonely and heartbroken over Paige's departure, Emily starts a relationship with her new co-worker (Miranda Rae Mayo). However, when Emily discovers that Talia is married and their relationship is calming down, she breaks up. Emily volunteers in a beauty pageant when Hanna, who was wanting money for college, loses. Later, the girls discover Alison's innocence and try to clear Alison's name and free Hanna. In the season finale, Emily and the others are arrested as accomplices to Mona's murder; however, on the way to prison, their van is hijacked by \"A.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the Liars' abduction orchestrated by \"A,\" Emily befriends a former missing girl, Sara Harvey (Dre Davis), who was also Charles/\"A's\" prisoner. She is trying to help Sara adapt again into society, with the cost of denying her own stuff. Nicole (Rebecca Breeds), the supervisor of Habitat for Humanity. offers Emily the option of moving to another country in order to help new people, and Emily gets forced to make a decision on her future. She chooses to stay in Rosewood and move on with Sara, only to betrayed when Sara is revealed to be \"A's\" right-hand woman. Later, Emily goes to Pepperdine University, but drops out later when her father dies. She starts to work as a bartender in Los Angeles, but returns to Rosewood at Alison's request, and also to depose on Charlotte's release from psychological hospital. A new \"A\", now entitled as \"A.D.\", surfaces, and steals Emily's eggs, which she donated in order to gain money for college. She starts to investigate Sara, who is free from jail, believing she's the new stalker. Also in this season, Emily befriends (Lulu Brud), the new-in-charge at the Brew, which in the following season lead to a brief hook up.\n\nIn \"Tick-Tock, Bitches\", Emily goes to Welby State Psychiatric Hospital to see Alison, who is blaming herself for something. Worried, Emily drives to Alison's house and finds the sweater that a blonde girl was using the night Charlotte died. Meanwhile, Hanna is held captive by \"A.D.\", who asked to the Liars, Caleb and Ezra to find out who is Charlotte's killer. Emily gives the sweater to the group and Caleb flees, giving it to \"A.D.\" in hopes of saving Hanna. After, in \"Bedlam\", Hanna returns home after being rescued by Mary Drake. Emily explains to Hanna who Drake is, confirming that she was a patient at Radley Sanitarium, and is Jessica DiLaurentis' twin sister. Hanna then concludes that Mary is “Uber A.” They take her to Lucas's apartment, where Hanna retains a strange and rude behavior. Emily calls Spencer to talk outside the apartment, saying that Hanna has the look of fear she had while she was stuck in the Dollhouse. They also argue about Alison's safety at Welby State, with Spencer saying she's safe locked up, and Emily denying it. Back at the Welby State, Emily tries to visit Alison, but a nurse confirms that only family members can see her, and, following, (Huw Collins) repeated that Alison's conditions aren't the bests and rapidly avoid his conversation with Emily, leaving her unresigned. Following, Emily tells Spencer that Alison sounded frightened, and Emily urges the possibility of using Mary to visit Alison, since Mary's family. However, Spencer declines the idea. Aria, Emily and Spencer go talk with Elliott in order to gain the opportunity to visit Alison, and he continues to deny it. While Elliott is talking with someone on the phone, the girls receive a new message from “A.D.” and they realize that the stalker maybe is not so far as they think. At the Radley Hotel, Mary shows up and starts remembering the old Radley Sanitarium. Emily helps her and they deal to visit Alison together. At the psychiatric hospital, Alison wakes up and sees Emily. Alison claims for Emily's help, stating that Elliott is a bad person, and Alison sees Mary and starts thinking that she is her mother, Jessica. However, Elliott enters the room and he kicks out everybody, including the nurse (Gwen Holloway). In the hallway, Elliott asks to talk with Mary; and, inside an office, Mary complains that she was calling Elliott for two days, without an answer and tells Elliott that he has gone too far. Elliott says that Mary should not appear in the hospital and tells her to leave him to his work. Emily, meanwhile, is watching their shadows through an unfocused window. Later, during \"The Talented Mr. Rollins\", the Liars come up with a plan to help Alison, and, while in the woods, Hanna accidentally hits Elliott with her car, killing him instantly. Afterwards, Emily, Spencer and Aria bury Elliott's body and cover their tracks towards his death. Emily and Aria goes to visit Alison the next day at Welby State and discover that the police knows about Elliott stealing the Carissimi Group money and is after him.\n\nThroughout \"Along Comes Mary\" and \"\", Emily and Sabrina spend the night together and Emily gets late for a test. However, days later, while preparing a type of drink, Emily receives a message, which alleges that she scored 92% in the exam. Sequentially, a message from \"A.D.\" is received, revealing that he took the exam for Emily. Emily contacts the mysterious person who was helping Elliott through his burner phone, and she and Aria drives to Elliott's secret apartment. Aria and Emily find a mess that had been used to cover up Elliott's traces. The two discover that Acher surname is Dunhill, and connect directly to the acronym \"A.D.\" They also found a fake head, several pictures of Darren Wilden's physical characteristics, passports, and a notebook with different types of payments. Emily and Aria get scared when someone tries to enter the apartment; however, they open the door when discover that is Toby. He says the police found out about the apartment in a document found in Elliott's car. Toby commands the girls to leave, and gets angry when he discovers that they have left fingerprints in some objects. Emily and Sabrina mark a new encounter on Saturday. At the Radley, Emily arrives at Jenna's room in order to deliver two drinks. Emily peeks into Jenna's laptop, but is stopped by Sara, who screams at her. Emily reveals to the two that someone is stalking her and her friends, after which Jenna (Tammin Sursok) tells Emily a story of when Charlotte was still checked in the psychiatric hospital. In the flashback, Charlotte enlists Jenna's help to find her birth mother and make Archer Dunhill the alias of Elliott Rollins in order to purposely meet Alison and take advantage of her good intentions for her eventual release. Jenna then reveals she's angry because of Charlotte's death. Emily leaves the room, but before she does, Sara warns Emily, trying to say that someone is dangerous. However, she is interrupted before saying who is in danger, when Jenna calls her. Emily tells Alison about what Jenna revealed to her, and Alison gets angry. After, in the DiLaurentis' house, Alison receives Hanna's call warning her about the danger; after, Alison invites the cop who is securing her house to enter. However, when she goes to her room, the officer—who is actually \"A.D\" with a mask—attacks her. During the struggle, Alison rips off part of the mask, claiming that she saw Elliott, but A.D. retreats when the police's siren is heard. Emily comforts Alison after the confusion faded. By the end of \"Wanted: Dead or Alive\", a maid discover Sara's dead body in her apartment.\n\nIn \"Original G'A'ngsters\", Emily and her mother, Pam (Nia Peeples), are running and exercising through the city forest and Emily decides to take her to celebrate her birthday in the Radley. They celebrate later as her mother enters a group of brides-to-be women. During \"Exes and OMGs\", she receives a job-offer from Principal Hackett (John O'Brien) to work as a swim coach at the school, and finds out that Paige (Lindsey Shaw) has returned to Rosewood and is also a candidate for the job. Paige reveals to Emily that she almost joined the Olympics, but a car accident ended up destroying that possibility. Plus, in \"The Wrath of Kahn\", Emily reveals to Paige about the new \"A.D.\", and her relationship with Sabrina plummets. Meanwhile, in \"The Darkest Knight\", Alison reveals to Emily that she's pregnant with Archer's baby, and they kiss. Paige accuses Emily of being Alison's \"puppet,\" though she didn’t know about the hookup or the pregnancy. Later, the Liars goes to a school for the blind in order to find out more about Mary Drake and \"A.D.\", and Jenna, armed with a gun, attempts to murder the Liars with Noel. However, Noel, while attacking Hanna and Emily, trips on his axe and accidentally kills himself via decapitation. Jenna then shoots at the Liars, as they run, but get separated from Spencer, who is shot. Before Jenna could cause more damage, she is taken down by Mary Drake and pulled away by \"A.D.\" unseen. Mary then reveals that she is Spencer's biological mother.\n\nIn the mid-season premiere, Emily and Paige are introduced to Rosewood High's staff as swimming coach and athletic department supervisor, respectively, which cause Alison to feel jealous about Paige. Alison and Emily discuss Alison's jealousy towards Paige. Ultimately, Alison verbally fights with Paige during a school staff reunion, leaving things awkward. After, in \"These Boots Were Made for Stalking\", Emily is accused by high school student Addison Derringer (Ava Allan) of being inappropriate, while Addison gathers photos of Emily with Alison. Paige tries to solve the situation, but Emily ends up screaming at Addison; ultimately, Paige calls Addison's father and she's called to the Principal's room. Following, in \"Hold Your Piece\", Aria and Emily team up to investigate Sydney for more information about Jenna and her connection to \"A.D\".\n\nDrusilla Moorhouse of E! Online writes that the character has \"transformed from a confused girl to a badass babe\". The Florida Family Association has condemned the character for her sexuality, and General Motors has subsequently pulled their advertising. However, GM denied that they did so over the character's sexual identity. The character debuted on After Ellen's Hot 100 at number seven.\n\n"}

{"id": "14330368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14330368", "title": "Figura serpentinata", "text": "Figura serpentinata\n\nFigura serpentinata (Italian - serpentine figure) is a style in painting and sculpture, intended to make the figure seem more dynamic, that is typical of Mannerism. It is similar, but not identical, to contrapposto, and features figures often in a spiral pose. Early examples can be seen in the work of Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael and Michelangelo.\n\nEmil Maurer writes of the painter and theorist Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo (1538–1600): \"The recommended ideal form unites, after Lomazzo, three qualities: the pyramid, the \"serpentinata\" movement and a certain numerical proportion, all three united to form one whole. At the same time, precedence is given to the \"moto\", that is, to the meandering movement, which should make the pyramid, in exact proportion, into the geometrical form of a cone.\"\nBousquet holds that the \"serpentinata\" style arose as a result of the discovery of the Laocoön group in 1506, and its deep impact on all artists, but on Michelangelo in particular. John Shearman also argues that it was invented by Michelangelo, citing the \"Victors\" that he produced for Pope Julius II's tomb. Maurer, on the other hand, can only detect this style rarely in Michelangelo's work and cites Beccafumi instead as its pioneer. Beccafumi's student Marco Pino connected Beccafumi's style with those of Salviati, Parmigianino and perhaps even Michelangelo, and his work as a whole is marked by \"serpentinata\" motifs. Paolo Pino himself says in his \"Dialogo della Pittura\", that his figures' poses are many and varied, and that in all his works to find one single figure, that completely and utterly distorts, is ambivalent and difficult.\n\nAs Maurer writes, painters are freer than sculptors and less closely tied-down to nature. Thus they can play around with their figures, reshaping, overstretching, geometricising, dissolving, caricaturing, colouring, meandering, according to the painting's goal and intended effect. With the loosening of the norms of the Renaissance and the development of the \"Serpentita\" style, that style's structures and rules began to be systematised. A style of form began by which figures showed physical power, passion, tension and semantic perfection. Movements were not without motivation, nor even simply done with a will, but with will shown in a pure form. Also their actions arose not out of power, but powerlessness.\n\nThe style exerted an influence even into the 1620s, with Bernini's \"The Rape of Proserpina\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20661460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20661460", "title": "Gonfaloniere of Justice", "text": "Gonfaloniere of Justice\n\nGonfaloniere of Justice (\"Gonfaloniere di Giustizia\") was a post in the government of medieval and early Renaissance Florence. Like Florence's Priori, it was introduced in 1293 when Giano Della Bella's Ordinances of Justice came into force.\n\nHe was one of the nine citizens selected by drawing lots every two months, who formed the government, or Signoria. As \"Gonfaloniere di Giustizia\" he was the temporary standard-bearer of the Republic of Florence and custodian of the city's banner, which was displayed from the yardarm of a portable cross. Along with the voting rights of the other Priori, he was also in charge of the internal security forces and the maintenance of public order. To distinguish him from his other eight colleagues, his crimson coat, lined with ermine, was further embroidered with golden stars. Each of Florence's neighborhoods, or \"rioni\", had its own \"priore\" who might be selected to serve on the council, and its own \"gonfaloniere di compagnia\" selected from the first families of each quarter.\n\n13th century Italy was a 'land of cities' and Florence was one of the richest and most politically restless among them. The most obvious signs of this prosperity and economic power were its striking of 3.5 gram gold florins and the presence of the city's large mercantile and financier companies right across Europe and Africa. These companies' leaders demanded increasing involvement in the city's political life, claiming equal or greater dignity than the old noble families who held now unproductive rural land outside the town. In the 13th and 14th centuries the Arti Maggiori would be key to the city's economic ascent and the middle class's revenge on the feudal nobility. This state of affairs would last until at least 1347, when the English monarchy's bankruptcy due to its high military expenditure in the Hundred Years' War dragged even the Bardi and Peruzzi businesses (the latter alone owed around 600,000 guilders) into ruin.\n\nThe post of Gonfaloniere survived practically until the abolition of the Republican constitution by the Medici on their return to the city in 1530. Indeed, in the 15th century the post was given to many members of the Medici family and their neighbouring and allied families, giving them a kind of recognised power within the republican framework and \"de facto\" (though never \"de jure\") allowing them to take over the powers of the other old magistracies.\n\nAfter the expulsion of Piero the Unfortunate in 1494 and during the brief rule of Girolamo Savonarola (executed in 1498), the Florentine families tried to reorganise the city government on the model of the old communal magistracies. Pier Soderini was in 1502 appointed gonfaloniere for life, but only held it until the end of 1512, when the Medici returned and Piero decided to abandon the city. During his tenure, Soderini held more direct political responsibility than either Cosimo de' Medici or Lorenzo de' Medici. Machiavelli served as his secretary. Although many of the \"Ottimati\" or aristocrats had supported Soderini's candidacy for Gonfaloniere a Vita, believing he would support their interests, they turned against him when his popular leanings became clear. In 1512, after fierce resistance to imperial troops under Charles V and pope Julius II, it was finally forced to surrender. This marked the end of the republican dream and its offices, with the start of the ascent of the grand-ducal Medici dynasty.\n\n"}

Marin was influenced by Cubism, with its flattened spaces and angularity. He honed a style of frenetic brushwork to create this dynamic image of water, wind, and clouds.

{"id": "28765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28765", "title": "Lawrence Alma-Tadema", "text": "Lawrence Alma-Tadema\n\nSir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, (; born Lourens Alma Tadema ; 8 January 1836 – 25 June 1912) was a Dutch painter of special British denizenship. Born in Dronrijp, the Netherlands, and trained at the Royal Academy of Antwerp, Belgium, he settled in England in 1870 and spent the rest of his life there. A classical-subject painter, he became famous for his depictions of the luxury and decadence of the Roman Empire, with languorous figures set in fabulous marbled interiors or against a backdrop of dazzling blue Mediterranean Sea and sky. Though admired during his lifetime for his draftsmanship and depictions of Classical antiquity, his work fell into disrepute after his death, and only since the 1960s has it been re-evaluated for its importance within nineteenth-century British art.\n\nLourens Alma Tadema was born on 8 January 1836 in the village of Dronrijp in the province of Friesland in the north of the Netherlands. The surname \"Tadema\" is an old Frisian patronymic, meaning 'son of Tade', while the names \"Lourens\" and \"Alma\" came from his godfather. He was the sixth child of Pieter Jiltes Tadema (1797–1840), the village notary, and the third child of Hinke Dirks Brouwer (–1863). His father had three sons from a previous marriage. His parents' first child died young, and the second was Atje (–1876), Lourens' sister, for whom he had great affection.\n\nThe Tadema family moved in 1838 to the nearby city of Leeuwarden, where Pieter's position as a notary would be more lucrative. His father died when Lourens was four, leaving his mother with five children: Lourens, his sister, and three boys from his father's first marriage. His mother had artistic leanings, and decided that drawing lessons should be incorporated into the children's education. He received his first art training with a local drawing master hired to teach his older half-brothers.\n\nIt was intended that the boy would become a lawyer; but in 1851 at the age of fifteen he suffered a physical and mental breakdown. Diagnosed as consumptive and given only a short time to live, he was allowed to spend his remaining days at his leisure, drawing and painting. Left to his own devices he regained his health and decided to pursue a career as an artist.\n\nIn 1852 he entered the Royal Academy of Antwerp in Belgium where he studied early Dutch and Flemish art, under Gustaf Wappers. During Alma-Tadema's four years as a registered student at the Academy, he won several respectable awards.\n\nBefore leaving school, towards the end of 1855, he became assistant to the painter and professor Louis (Lodewijk) Jan de Taeye, whose courses in history and historical costume he had greatly enjoyed at the Academy. Although de Taeye was not an outstanding painter, Alma-Tadema respected him and became his studio assistant, working with him for three years. De Taeye introduced him to books that influenced his desire to portray Merovingian subjects early in his career. He was encouraged to depict historical accuracy in his paintings, a trait for which the artist became known.\n\nAlma-Tadema left Taeye's studio in November 1858 returning to Leeuwarden before settling in Antwerp, where he began working with the painter Baron Jan August Hendrik Leys, whose studio was one of the most highly regarded in Belgium. Under his guidance Alma-Tadema painted his first major work: \"The Education of the children of Clovis\" (1861). This painting created a sensation among critics and artists when it was exhibited that year at the Artistic Congress in Antwerp. It is said to have laid the foundation of his fame and reputation. Alma-Tadema related that although Leys thought the completed painting better than he had expected, he was critical of the treatment of marble, which he compared to cheese.\n\nAlma-Tadema took this criticism very seriously, and it led him to improve his technique and to become the world's foremost painter of marble and variegated granite. Despite any reproaches from his master, \"The Education of the Children of Clovis\" was honorably received by critics and artists alike and was eventually purchased and subsequently given to King Leopold of Belgium.\n\nIn the 1860 he befriended the Anglo Dutch painters Dommersen /(van)Dommelshuizen in Utrecht where he portrayed in 1862 in Utrecht in pencil drawings of Mrs. Cornelia Dommershuizen and one of her sons, Thomas Hendrik Dommersen / Dommershuizen. The latter brothers were the painters Pieter Cornelis Dommersen and Cornelis Christiaan Dommersen.\n\nMerovingian themes were the painter's favourite subject up to the mid-1860s. It is perhaps in this series that we find the artist moved by the deepest feeling and the strongest spirit of romance. However Merovingian subjects did not have a wide international appeal, so he switched to themes of life in ancient Egypt that were more popular. On these scenes of Frankish and Egyptian life Alma-Tadema spent great energy and much research. In 1862 Alma-Tadema left Leys's studio and started his own career, establishing himself as a significant classical-subject European artist.\n\n1863 was to alter the course of Alma-Tadema's personal and professional life: on 3 January his invalid mother died, and on 24 September he was married, in Antwerp City Hall, to Marie-Pauline Gressin Dumoulin, the daughter of Eugène Gressin Dumoulin, a French journalist living near Brussels. Nothing is known of their meeting and little of Pauline herself, as Alma-Tadema never spoke about her after her death in 1869. Her image appears in a number of oils, though he painted her portrait only three times, the most notable appearing in \"My studio\" (1867). The couple had three children. Their eldest and only son lived only a few months dying of smallpox. Their two daughters, Laurence (1864–1940) and Anna (1867–1943), both had artistic leanings: the former in literature, the latter in art. Neither would marry.\n\nAlma-Tadema and his wife spent their honeymoon in Florence, Rome, Naples and Pompeii. This, his first visit to Italy, developed his interest in depicting the life of ancient Greece and Rome, especially the latter since he found new inspiration in the ruins of Pompeii, which fascinated him and would inspire much of his work in the coming decades.\n\nDuring the summer of 1864, Tadema met Ernest Gambart, the most influential print publisher and art dealer of the period. Gambart was highly impressed with the work of Tadema, who was then painting \"Egyptian chess players\" (1865). The dealer, recognising at once the unusual gifts of the young painter, gave him an order for twenty-four pictures and arranged for three of Tadema's paintings to be shown in London. In 1865, Tadema relocated to Brussels where he was named a knight of the Order of Leopold.\n\nOn 28 May 1869, after years of ill health, Pauline died at Schaerbeek, in Belgium, at the age of thirty-two, of smallpox. Her death left Tadema disconsolate and depressed. He ceased painting for nearly four months. His sister Artje, who lived with the family, helped with the two daughters then aged five and two. Artje took over the role of housekeeper and remained with the family until 1873 when she married.\n\nDuring the summer Tadema himself began to suffer from a medical problem which doctors in Brussels were frustratingly unable to diagnose. Gambart eventually advised him to go to England for another medical opinion. Soon after his arrival in London in December 1869, Alma-Tadema was invited to the home of the painter Ford Madox Brown. There he met Laura Theresa Epps, who was seventeen years old, and fell in love with her at first sight.\n\nThe outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July 1870 compelled Alma-Tadema to leave the continent and move to London. His infatuation with Laura Epps played a great part in his relocation to England and Gambart felt that the move would be advantageous to the artist's career. In stating his reasons for the move, Tadema simply said \"I lost my first wife, a French lady with whom I married in 1863, in 1869. Having always had a great predilection for London, the only place where, up till then my work had met with buyers, I decided to leave the continent and go to settle in England, where I have found a true home.\"\n\nWith his small daughters and sister Atje, Alma-Tadema arrived in London at the beginning of September 1870. The painter wasted no time in contacting Laura, and it was arranged that he would give her painting lessons. During one of these, he proposed marriage. As he was then thirty-four and Laura was now only eighteen, her father was initially opposed to the idea. Dr Epps finally agreed on the condition that they should wait until they knew each other better. They married in July 1871. Laura, under her married name, also won a high reputation as an artist, and appears in numerous of Alma-Tadema's canvases after their marriage (\"The Women of Amphissa\" (1887) being a notable example). This second marriage was enduring and happy, though childless, and Laura became stepmother to Anna and Laurence. Anna became a painter and Laurence became a novelist.\n\nHe would initially adopt the name \"Laurence Alma Tadema\" instead of \"Lourens Alma Tadema\" and later adopt the more English \"Lawrence\" for his forename, and incorporate \"Alma\" into his surname so that he appeared at the beginning of exhibition catalogues, under \"A\" rather than under \"T\". He did not actually hyphenate his last name, but it was done by others and this has since become the convention.\n\nAfter his arrival in England, where he was to spend the rest of his life, Alma-Tadema's career was one of continued success. He became one of the most famous and highly paid artists of his time, acknowledged and rewarded. By 1871 he had met and befriended most of the major Pre-Raphaelite painters and it was in part due to their influence that the artist brightened his palette, varied his hues, and lightened his brushwork.\n\nIn 1872 Alma-Tadema organised his paintings into an identification system by including an opus number under his signature and assigning his earlier pictures numbers as well. \"Portrait of my sister, Artje\", painted in 1851, is numbered opus I, while two months before his death he completed \"Preparations in the Coliseum\", opus CCCCVIII. Such a system would make it difficult for fakes to be passed off as originals.\n\nIn 1873 Queen Victoria in Council by letters patent made Alma-Tadema and his wife what are now the last British Denizens (the legal process has theoretically not yet been abolished in the United Kingdom), with some limited special rights otherwise only accorded to and enjoyed by British subjects (what would now be called British citizens). The previous year he and his wife made a journey on the Continent that lasted five and a half months and took them through Brussels, Germany, and Italy. In Italy they were able to take in the ancient ruins again; this time he purchased several photographs, mostly of the ruins, which began his immense collection of folios with archival material sufficient for the documentation used in the completion of future paintings. In January 1876, he rented a studio in Rome. The family returned to London in April, visiting the Parisian Salon on their way back. In London he regularly met with fellow-artist Emil Fuchs.\n\nAmong the most important of his pictures during this period was \"An Audience at Agrippa's\" (1876). When an admirer of the painting offered to pay a substantial sum for a painting with a similar theme, Alma-Tadema simply turned the emperor around to show him leaving in \"After the Audience\".\n\nOn 19 June 1879, Alma-Tadema was made a full Academician, his most personally important award. Three years later a major retrospective of his entire oeuvre was organised at the Grosvenor Gallery in London, including 185 of his pictures.\n\nIn 1883 he returned to Rome and, most notably, Pompeii, where further excavations had taken place since his last visit. He spent a significant amount of time studying the site, going there daily. These excursions gave him an ample source of subject matter as he began to further his knowledge of daily Roman life. At times, however, he integrated so many objects into his paintings that some said they resembled museum catalogues.\n\nOne of his most famous paintings is \"The Roses of Heliogabalus\" (1888) – based on an episode from the life of the debauched Roman Emperor Elagabalus (Heliogabalus), the painting depicts the Emperor suffocating his guests at an orgy under a cascade of rose petals. The blossoms depicted were sent weekly to the artist's London studio from the Riviera for four months during the winter of 1887–1888.\n\nAmong Alma-Tadema's works of this period are: \"An Earthly Paradise\" (1891), \"Unconscious Rivals\" (1893) \"Spring\" (1894), \"The Coliseum\" (1896) and \"The Baths of Caracalla\" (1899). Although Alma-Tadema's fame rests on his paintings set in Antiquity, he also painted portraits, landscapes and watercolours, and made some etchings himself (although many more were made of his paintings by others).\n\nFor all the quiet charm and erudition of his paintings, Alma-Tadema himself preserved a youthful sense of mischief. He was childlike in his practical jokes and in his sudden bursts of bad temper, which could as suddenly subside into an engaging smile.\n\nIn his personal life, Alma-Tadema was an extrovert and had a remarkably warm personality. He had most of the characteristics of a child, coupled with the admirable traits of a consummate professional. A perfectionist, he remained in all respects a diligent, if somewhat obsessive and pedantic worker. He was an excellent businessman, and one of the wealthiest artists of the nineteenth century. Alma-Tadema was as firm in money matters as he was with the quality of his work.\n\nAs a man, Lawrence Alma-Tadema was a robust, fun loving and rather portly gentleman. There was not a hint of the delicate artist about him; he was a cheerful lover of wine, women and parties.\n\nAlma-Tadema's output decreased with time, partly on account of health, but also because of his obsession with decorating his new home, to which he moved in 1883. Nevertheless, he continued to exhibit throughout the 1880s and into the next decade, receiving a plentiful amount of accolades along the way, including the medal of Honour at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1889, election to an honorary member of the Oxford University Dramatic Society in 1890, the Great Gold Medal at the International Exposition in Brussels of 1897. In 1899 he was Knighted in England, only the eighth artist from the Continent to receive the honour. Not only did he assist with the organisation of the British section at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris, he also exhibited two works that earned him the Grand Prix Diploma. He also assisted with the St. Louis World's Fair of 1904 where he was well represented and received.\n\nDuring this time, Alma-Tadema was very active with theatre design and production, designing many costumes. He also spread his artistic boundaries and began to design furniture, often modelled after Pompeian or Egyptian motifs, illustrations, textiles, and frame making. His diverse interests highlight his talents. Each of these exploits were used in his paintings, as he often incorporated some of his designed furniture into the composition, and must have used many of his own designs for the clothing of his female subjects. Through his last period of creativity Alma-Tadema continued to produce paintings, which repeat the successful formula of women in marble terraces overlooking the sea such as in \"Silver Favourites\" (1903). Between 1906 and his death six years later, Alma-Tadema painted less but still produced ambitious paintings like \"The Finding of Moses\" (1904).\n\nOn 15 August 1909 Alma-Tadema's wife, Laura, died at the age of fifty-seven. The grief-stricken widower outlived his second wife by less than three years. His last major composition was \"Preparation in the Coliseum\" (1912). In the summer of 1912, Alma-Tadema was accompanied by his daughter Anna to Kaiserhof Spa, Wiesbaden, Germany where he was to undergo treatment for ulceration of the stomach. He died there on 28 June 1912 at the age of seventy-six. He was buried in a crypt in St Paul's Cathedral in London.\n\nAlma-Tadema's works are remarkable for the way in which flowers, textures and hard reflecting substances, like metals, pottery, and especially marble, are painted – indeed, his realistic depiction of marble led him to be called the 'marbellous painter'. His work shows much of the fine execution and brilliant colour of the old Dutch masters. By the human interest with which he imbues all his scenes from ancient life he brings them within the scope of modern feeling, and charms us with gentle sentiment and playfulness.\n\nFrom early in his career, Alma-Tadema was particularly concerned with architectural accuracy, often including objects that he would see at museums – such as the British Museum in London – in his works. He also read many books and took many images from them. He amassed an enormous number of photographs from ancient sites in Italy, which he used for the most precise accuracy in the details of his compositions.\n\nAlma-Tadema was a perfectionist. He worked assiduously to make the most of his paintings, often repeatedly reworking parts of paintings before he found them satisfactory to his own high standards. One humorous story relates that one of his paintings was rejected and instead of keeping it, he gave the canvas to a maid who used it as her table cover. He was sensitive to every detail and architectural line of his paintings, as well as the settings he was depicting. For many of the objects in his paintings, he would depict what was in front of him, using fresh flowers imported from across the continent and even from Africa, rushing to finish the paintings before the flowers died. It was this commitment to veracity that earned him recognition but also caused many of his adversaries to take up arms against his almost encyclopaedic works.\n\nAlma-Tadema's work has been linked with that of European Symbolist painters. As an artist of international reputation, he can be cited as an influence on European figures such as Gustav Klimt and Fernand Khnopff. Both painters incorporate classical motifs into their works and use Alma-Tadema's unconventional compositional devices such as abrupt cut-off at the edge of the canvas. They, like Alma-Tadema, also employ coded imagery to convey meaning to their paintings.\n\nAlma-Tadema was among the most financially successful painters of the Victorian era, though never matching Edwin Henry Landseer. For over sixty years he gave his audience exactly what they wanted: distinctive, elaborate paintings of beautiful people in classical settings. His incredibly detailed reconstructions of ancient Rome, with languid men and women posed against white marble in dazzling sunlight provided his audience with a glimpse of a world of the kind they might one day construct for themselves at least in attitude if not in detail. As with other painters, the reproduction rights for prints were often worth more than the canvas, and a painting with its rights still attached may have been sold to Gambart for £10,000 in 1874; without rights it was sold again in 1903, when Alma-Tadema's prices were actually higher, for £2,625. Typical prices were between £2,000 and £3,000 in the 1880s, but at least three works sold for between £5,250 and £6,060 in the 1900s. Prices held well until the general collapse of Victorian prices in the early 1920s, when they fell to the hundreds, where they remained until the 1960s; by 1969 £4,600 had been reached again (the huge effect of inflation must of course be remembered for all these figures).\n\nThe last years of Alma-Tadema's life saw the rise of Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, Cubism and Futurism, of which he heartily disapproved. As his pupil John Collier wrote, 'it is impossible to reconcile the art of Alma-Tadema with that of Matisse, Gauguin and Picasso.'\n\nHis artistic legacy almost vanished. As attitudes of the public in general and the artists in particular became more sceptical of the possibilities of human achievement, his paintings were increasingly denounced. He was declared \"the worst painter of the 19th century\" by John Ruskin, and one critic even remarked that his paintings were \"about worthy enough to adorn bourbon boxes.\" After this brief period of being actively derided, he was consigned to relative obscurity for many years. Only since the 1960s has Alma-Tadema's work been re-evaluated for its importance within the nineteenth century, and more specifically, within the evolution of English art.\n\nHe is now regarded as one of the principal classical-subject painters of the nineteenth century whose works demonstrate the care and exactitude of an era mesmerised by trying to visualise the past, some of which was being recovered through archaeological research.\n\nAlma-Tadema's meticulous archaeological research, including research into Roman architecture (which was so thorough that every building featured in his canvases could have been built using Roman tools and methods) led to his paintings being used as source material by Hollywood directors in their vision of the ancient world for films such as D. W. Griffith's \"Intolerance\" (1916), \"Ben Hur\" (1926),\" Cleopatra\" (1934), and most notably of all, Cecil B. DeMille's epic remake of \"The Ten Commandments\" (1956). Indeed, Jesse Lasky Jr., the co-writer on \"The Ten Commandments\", described how the director would customarily spread out prints of Alma-Tadema paintings to indicate to his set designers the look he wanted to achieve. The designers of the Oscar-winning Roman epic \"Gladiator\" used the paintings of Alma-Tadema as a central source of inspiration. Alma-Tadema's paintings were also the inspiration for the design of the interior of Cair Paravel castle in the 2005 film \"\".\n\nIn 1962, New York art dealer Robert Isaacson mounted the first show of Alma-Tadema's work in fifty years; by the late 1960s, the revival of interest in Victorian painting gained impetus, and a number of well-attended exhibitions were held. Allen Funt, the creator and host of the American version of the television show \"Candid Camera\", was a collector of Alma-Tadema paintings at a time when the artist's reputation in the 20th century was at its nadir; in a relatively few years he bought 35 works, about ten percent of Alma-Tadema's output. After Funt was robbed by his accountant (who subsequently committed suicide), he was forced to sell his collection at Sotheby's in London in November 1973. From this sale, the interest in Alma-Tadema was re-awakened.\n\nIn 1960, the Newman Gallery firstly tried to sell, then give away (without success) one of his most celebrated works, \"The Finding of Moses\" (1904). The initial purchaser had paid £5,250 for it on its completion, and subsequent sales were for £861 in 1935, £265 in 1942, and it was \"bought in\" at £252 in 1960 (having failed to meet its reserve), but when the same picture was auctioned at Christies in New York in May 1995, it sold for £1.75 million. On 4 November 2010 it was sold for $35,922,500 to an undisclosed bidder at Sotheby's New York, a new record for the artist and a Victorian painting. On 5 May 2011 his \"The Meeting of Antony and Cleopatra: 41 BC\" was sold at the same auction house for $29.2 million.\n\nA blue plaque unveiled in 1975 commemorates Alma-Tadema at 44 Grove End Road, St John's Wood, his home from 1886 until his death in 1912.\nReferences\n\nSources\n\n"}

The earliest account of Omar's final resting place is provided by his pupil Nizami Aruzi who visited his tomb in 1135-6. In Balkh, in 1112-13, Nizami heard Omar make a prophecy about his place of burial, that his grave \"would be where flowers in the springtime would shed their petals over his dust\". He describes visiting his grave in what was then the \"cemetery of Hayrah\":\n\n[his prophecy] seemed to me impossible, though I knew that one such as he would not speak idle words. When I arrived at Nishapur in the year A.H. 530, it being then four years since that great man had veiled his countenance in the dust, and this nether world had been bereaved of him. Since he was my master, on the eve of a Friday, with a companion, I went to visit his grave in the Hayrah Cemetery, I turned left and saw a grave situated at the foot of a garden-wall, over which pear-trees and peach-trees thrust their heads, and on his grave had fallen so many flower-leaves that his dust was hidden beneath the flowers. This reminded me of the conversation I had heard from him in the city of Balkh, I wept, for in the four corners of the world I had seen no one like him.\n\nThe tomb itself survived various calamities; including several major earthquakes (Nishapur being on a seismic fault-line), raids by some Turkic tribes, and the Mongol invasion.\n\nIn the succeeding centuries, Omar's grave had become a part of the mosque containing the shrine of a certain Islamic saint called \"Imamzadeh Muhammad Mahruk\" (d. eighth century), the brother of Reza. The mosque had a turquoise dome and was likely erected in the seventeenth century. Some pilgrims to Omar's grave, such as the Iranologist A. V. Williams Jackson who visited his tomb in 1911, described his tomb as a simple case made of brick and cement with no inscription.\n\nThe reconstruction of the mausoleum was commissioned by the Iranian government in 1934 during Ferdowsi's millenary. Omar's tomb was separated from the mosque, and a white marble monument, designed by the architect Hooshang Seyhoun, was erected over it. The construction was completed in 1963.\n\n"}

Ellis also co-produced and co-wrote the film. The film was selected as the British entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 86th Academy Awards, but it was not nominated.\n\nOscar Ramirez is a rice farmer who lives in Banaue Province with his wife Mai and their children Angel and Baby. When his rice crops are no longer profitable, he relocates his family to Metro Manila in hopes of obtaining a higher quality of life. While searching for a job, they are offered shelter at a low-income apartment building, but are shortly evicted by the police for squatting, as the men who offered them the apartment turn out to be swindlers.\n\nThe next day, the family moves into a vacated house in the slums of Tondo while Oscar secures a job as a security officer for Manila Armored Couriers after the other guards discover his military background. He befriends his senior officer Ong and quickly bonds with his co-workers while earning the respect of Buddha, the president of the armoured truck company. On Oscar's first day at work, Ong tells him he lost his previous partner during a failed robbery six months prior. Ong is also concerned about Oscar's residence in Tondo, which is a hotbed for criminals. One night, Oscar tells Ong the story of Alfred Santos, a man who held up an airliner and jumped off the plane to his death after losing his father and his family's silk factory to a rival company. Oscar feels responsible, as he had previously worked at the factory and did not stand up for his former employer. Ong offers Oscar a spare apartment unit in Makati for his family to live in. Meanwhile, Mai lands a job as a bar hostess at a nightclub in Makati. While undergoing the mandatory physical checkup, she is revealed to be pregnant. Mai quickly learns of the hardships she must endure as a bar hostess. When she fails to make her drink quota and her pregnancy becomes more evident, her boss proposes to have nine-year-old Angel work for special clients.\n\nDuring a routine job, Oscar discovers that the client is a drug dealer and sees Ong take a handout for the delivery. The duo have a tense discussion on the corruption that shrouds Metro Manila. When Ong pulls over to find a wall to urinate on, Oscar suddenly sees a black Honda Civic pull over with a group of men headed toward Ong's direction. Going against his protocol, he exits the armoured van and follows the gang on foot, only to discover that they are in cahoots with Ong. After the gang leaves, Ong reveals to Oscar that after the failed robbery, he took one of the security boxes with him, and he is plotting with the gang to have the box opened by staging a robbery and having himself \"debriefed\" in the company's processing centre while Oscar makes an imprint of the key in another room. He also threatens to blackmail Oscar with the truth about his wife working as a bar hostess, as well as the clever scheme of renting out the spare apartment under Oscar's name and hiding the box there. Just as Ong prepares to surrender the box, he realizes that the robber in front of him is not part of the gang but the same man who killed his former partner. The man guns him down and runs away while the gang speeds off. Oscar is then given the grievous task of \"postman\", having to deliver Ong's personal effects and severance pay to his wife. He does not disclose Ong's plot to Buddha. As per company procedure, his pay is suspended until the investigation is closed.\n\nUpon learning that Ong's wife is aware of the security box, Oscar races back home and finds it under the floor. He and Mai face the dilemma of what to do with the box as she tells him it was a mistake for them to move to the city. One night, after a job, Oscar sneaks into the processing centre and takes an imprint of the key while stealing another one, but is quickly caught on security camera by Buddha and immediately cornered. He is shot in the chest and dies with the key in his hand. Misled by the different key Oscar stole, the company rushes armed men to the address of the drug dealer client while JJ, Oscar's new partner, becomes the \"postman\" to deliver Oscar's personal effects to Mai. She notices a locket that Oscar had stolen from a shop earlier that morning; upon opening it, she discovers a clay imprint of the key to the security box in her possession. After having the key duplicated, she takes her children and the money back to the province.\n\n\nDirector Sean Ellis took inspiration from his first trip to the Philippines when he witnessed two armoured truck drivers arguing with each other \n\nThe film was shot on location in the Philippines in 2011 with a Filipino cast and crew members. The script was written in English, but Ellis encouraged the cast to interpret their lines in Tagalog. Ellis used a Canon EOS 5D DSLR camera to capture the footage.\n\nThe story of Alfred Santos is based on the Philippine Airlines Flight 812 hijacking on 25 May 2000.\n\n\"Metro Manila\" had its International premiere at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival on 20 January 2013. It was also released on 17 July 2013 in France, 28 August 2013 in Belgium, 29 August 2013 in the Netherlands, and 20 September 2013 in the UK. It had its Philippine premiere on 9 October 2013.\n\nThe film was re-released with special screenings to raise money for the victims of Typhoon Haiyan/Yolanda that had hit the Philippines and killed close to 6000 people. Ellis said: \"The people of the Philippines were tremendously supportive during the making of Metro Manila, and it's only right that we should now use the film to raise money to help the victims of this terrible disaster.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes lists a rating of 94% based on 31 reviews as of May 2016.\n\nAfter winning the Hamburg Film Critic Award at the 2013 Filmfest Hamburg, the jury said of the film: \"The themes of our times are what define this film: rural exodus and impoverishment, exploitation and poverty in the Moloch of overcrowded metropolises. Director Sean Ellis filmed this story in a language that is foreign to him - and yet still always manages to hit the right tone. He is emotional, yet never impassioned; poetic, yet never tawdry; raw without any hint of cynicism. A social drama that becomes a thriller, breathless and unstoppable. \"Metro Manila\" deserves to be seen by many. This film belongs in the cinema. ...\"\n\nRenowned Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar listed \"Metro Manila\" as one of his favourite films of 2013.\n\nAt the 2013 British Independent Film Awards (BIFA) Metro Manila was nominated in five categories and won awards for Achievement in Production, Best Director and Best British independent film.\n\n"}

Bearing portraits of former U.S. Presidents James Monroe and John Quincy Adams, the coin was issued in commemoration of the centennial of the Monroe Doctrine and was produced at the San Francisco Mint in 1923. Sculptor Chester Beach is credited with the design, although the reverse closely resembles an earlier work by Raphael Beck.\n\nIn 1922, the motion picture industry was faced with a number of scandals, including manslaughter charges against star Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle. Although Arbuckle was eventually acquitted, motion picture executives sought ways of getting good publicity for Hollywood. One means was an exposition, to be held in Los Angeles in mid-1923. To induce Congress to issue a commemorative coin as a fundraiser for the fair, organizers associated the exposition with the 100th anniversary of the Monroe Doctrine, and legislation for a commemorative half dollar for the centennial was passed.\n\nThe exposition was a financial failure. The coins did not sell well, and the bulk of the mintage of over 270,000 was released into circulation. Beach faced accusations of plagiarism because of the similarity of the reverse design to a work by Beck, though he and fellow sculptor James Earle Fraser denied any impropriety. Many of the pieces that had been sold at a premium and saved were spent during the Depression; most surviving coins show evidence of wear.\n\nIn the early 1820s, the United States deemed two matters untoward interference by European powers in its zone of influence. The first was the Russian Ukase of 1821, asserting exclusive territorial and trading rights along much of what is today Canada's Pacific coast. The United States considered this area to be part of the Oregon Country and hoped to eventually gain control of it. The second was possible European threats against the Latin American nations, newly independent from Spain. United States officials feared that a Quadruple Alliance of Prussia, Austria, Russia, and France would restore Spain to power in the Americas.\nBritish foreign minister George Canning was concerned that in the event of a Spanish restoration in Latin America, his nation would lose the trade which it had gained there since the Spanish had been ousted. In 1823, he proposed to the American minister to Great Britain, Richard Rush, that their two nations issue a joint statement against the retaking of the former Spanish colonies by force. Rush asked for instructions from President James Monroe. The President consulted with his predecessors, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who favored the joint statement, as an alliance with Britain would protect the United States. Nevertheless, Monroe's Secretary of State, future president John Quincy Adams, felt that if the United States was going to set forth its principles, it should speak for itself and not seem to be following the lead of powerful Britain. Accordingly, Rush was instructed to decline the opportunity to enter into a joint statement, although he was to inform the British that the two nations agreed on most issues.\n\nThe policy which would, some 30 years later, come to be called the \"Monroe Doctrine\" was contained in the President's annual message to Congress on December 2, 1823. It warned European nations against new colonial ventures in the Americas, and against interference with Western Hemisphere governments. The doctrine had little practical effect at the time, as the United States lacked the ability to enforce it militarily and most European powers ignored it, considering it beneath their dignity even to respond. When Britain and other powers seized additional land in the Guianas in the 1830s, the United States did not issue a formal protest. The Mexican–American War of 1846–1848 increased Latin American suspicions over the doctrine, as many south of the border felt that the American purpose in warning European powers to keep out was to reserve the land for itself. Nevertheless, the Monroe Doctrine became an important part of United States foreign policy in the second half of the 19th and into the 20th century.\n\nBy 1922, the Hollywood film industry was in serious trouble. Established in the Los Angeles area during the 1910s after moving from such eastern venues as Fort Lee, New Jersey, the industry had been rocked by a number of scandals. These included the mysterious shooting death of film director William Desmond Taylor, and the subsequent evasive testimony concerning it by actress Mabel Normand, which helped destroy her career. Another notorious scandal of the early 1920s was the death of actress Virginia Rappe following an orgy at a San Francisco hotel. Actor Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle was, after three trials, acquitted of manslaughter, but the negative publicity ended his career as well. These scandals, together with the death of romantic lead Wallace Reid from a drug overdose and a number of instances of onscreen sexual explicitness, led to nationwide calls for a boycott of Hollywood films.\n\nFilm moguls sought means of damage control. They hired former Postmaster General Will H. Hays as censor to the industry; the Hays Code would govern how explicit a motion picture could be for decades to come. Another idea was an exposition and film festival to give good publicity to the industry, with the profits to be used for the making of educational films. Planning for this fair, to be held in Los Angeles in mid-1923, began in 1922. As other fairs, such as the World's Columbian Exposition and the Panama–Pacific Exposition, had procured the issuance of commemorative coins as a fundraiser, organizers sought a piece for the film fair. The city of Los Angeles wanted to use the fair to show it had come of age, as had Chicago for the Columbian Exposition and San Francisco with the Panama-Pacific event.\n\nRealizing that Congress might not pass legislation for a coin to commemorate a film industry celebration, the organizers sought a historical event with a major anniversary to occur in 1923, which could be honored both at the fair and on the coin. The obvious candidate was the Boston Tea Party of 1773, but according to numismatists Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen in their volume on U.S. commemorative coins, that episode \"could not be tortured into even the vaguest relevance to California, let alone to Los Angeles\". On December 18, 1922, California Congressman Walter Franklin Lineberger introduced a bill to strike a half dollar in commemoration of the centennial of the Monroe Doctrine, with the Los Angeles Clearing House (an association of banks) given the exclusive right to purchase the pieces from the government at face value. Lineberger claimed that Monroe's declaration had kept California, then owned by Mexico, out of the hands of European powers. The bill was questioned in the House of Representatives by Michigan Congressman Louis Cramton, and in the Senate by Vermont's Frank Greene, who stated, \"it seems to me that the question is not one of selling a coin at a particular value or a particular place. The question is whether the United States government is going to go on from year to year submitting its coinage to this—well—harlotry.\" Despite these objections, the bill was enacted on January 24, 1923; a mintage of 300,000 pieces was authorized.\n\nThe fair organizers did not await congressional approval to begin planning the coin. According to Swiatek and Breen, the fair's director general Frank B. Davison came up with the concept for the designs. On December 7, 1922, Commission of Fine Arts chairman Charles Moore wrote to Buffalo nickel designer and sculptor member of the commission James Earle Fraser, \"The Los Angeles people are planning to celebrate the Monroe Doctrine Centennial. They are going to have a 50-cent piece and have decided that on the obverse shall be the heads of President Monroe and John Quincy Adams ... On the reverse will be the western continents from Hudson Bay to Cape Horn with some dots for the West Indies and some indication of the Panama Canal ... It strikes me that the designs having been settled upon, the [plaster] models could be worked out quite readily and that a pretty swell thing could be made.\"\n\nFraser contacted fellow New York sculptor Chester Beach, who agreed to do the work. On December 27, Moore wrote to Davison, informing him of Beach's hiring, and that Fraser and Beach had decided to change the reverse. Moore quoted Beach's description of the revised design:\n\nMoore informed Davison that the commission had concurred with the revision, and that Beach had been instructed to complete work as quickly as possible so as to have the coins available at an early date. On February 24, 1923, commission secretary Hans Caemmerer showed the completed models to Assistant Director of the Mint Mary Margaret O'Reilly, who was pleased with them. O'Reilly suggested that if Beach was certain there would be no further changes, that he send photographs of the models to the commission's offices, to be forwarded with its endorsement to the Bureau of the Mint in Washington. This was done, and the designs were approved by both Mint Director Frank Edgar Scobey and Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon on March 8. Moore was enthusiastic about the designs, writing to Davison on March 21 that \"I feel great exultation over the way the model ... has turned out ... I do not know of a memorial [commemorative] coin which for sheer beauty equals this ...\"\n\nWilliam E. Pike, in his 2003 article in \"The Numismatist\" about the coin, deems the design \"uninspired\" and complains that the low relief of the coin leaves it without sufficient detail. Coin dealer and numismatic historian Q. David Bowers states that because of the shallow relief, \"newly minted coins had an insipid appearance. Few if any observers called them attractive.\" Art historian Cornelius Vermeule also complained about the relief, stating that it made the allegorical figures on the reverse \"seem like mounted cut-outs ... the way the females are contoured to achieve their appearance of continents is a clever tour de force of calligraphic relief but an aesthetic monstrosity, a bad pun in art.\" He had no more praise for the obverse, \"Adams, with his staring eye, is scarcely a portrait, and Monroe would not be recognized even by an expert.\"\nThe faint lines in the field around the continents represent various ocean currents, with the Gulf Stream to the upper right of the reverse. Swiatek and Breen speculate that the reason ocean currents were shown was to symbolize the trade routes between the continents. They also consider the design to have an Art Deco look, though noting that the lettering has more of an older, Art Nouveau appearance. Beach's monogram, CB made into a circle, is found at lower right of the reverse.\n\nOn July 23, 1923, Raphael Beck, who had designed the seal for the 1901 Pan-American Exposition, wrote to Mint Director Scobey to complain that the reverse design resembled his seal, which he had copyrighted in 1899, and that Beach should be given no further credit for it. The letter was forwarded to the Commission of Fine Arts for comment. In October, Fraser wrote to Beck, stating that he had suggested to Beach that he use figures to represent the continents instead of maps, and that he had never seen the Pan-American seal until Scobey forwarded the letter. According to Bowers, \"A comparison of the 1901 and 1923 designs, however, shows that this was highly unlikely.\"\n\nIn May and June 1923, 274,077 of the new half dollars were struck at the San Francisco Mint. Most of these were sent to the Los Angeles Clearing House, though 77 pieces were set aside for transmission to Philadelphia and examination by the 1924 United States Assay Commission.\nThe American Historical Revue and Motion Picture Industry Exposition was open from July 2 to August 4, 1923. The fair was located off of Figueroa Street in Exposition Park, just to the east of the brand-new Los Angeles Coliseum, where every evening a complimentary show for exposition visitors, \"Montezuma and the Fall of the Aztecs\", was given. Admission to the fair was fifty cents, though fairgoers could purchase a coin for a dollar at the box office and enter without further charge. After the first week, organizers realized the public was not interested in the historical theme, but was there to see favorite movie stars. Exhibitors accordingly greatly expanded the space devoted to movie attractions, but the exposition was a financial failure. Those in charge of the fair had hoped to attract a million visitors; the actual attendance was about 300,000, many of whom were teenagers given complimentary admission in the final two weeks of the fair. With the fair flirting with insolvency throughout its run, officials hoped the planned visit of President Warren Harding on August 6 would increase gate receipts, but Harding fell ill in San Francisco and died on August 2. According to Pike in his article, \"its effect on the industry [was] hard to measure. However, if Hollywood owes its current status in any way to the event, then it was quite a success indeed.\"\n\nApproximately 27,000 half dollars were sold at the price of $1, by mail, at banks, and at the fair. Sales continued after it closed, but by October 1923, they had dropped off to almost nothing, and the banks holding them released the remaining nine-tenths of the mintage into circulation, which accounts for the wear on most surviving specimens. Of those set aside, thousands more were spent during the Depression. The 2015 edition of \"A Guide Book of United States Coins\" lists it at $75 in uncirculated MS-60. Swiatek, in his 2012 volume on commemoratives, notes that many specimens have been treated to make them appear brighter or less worn; these, like other circulated pieces, are worth less. An exceptional specimen, certified in MS-67 condition, sold at auction for $29,900 in 2009.\n\n\nBooks\n\nOther sources\n"}

{"id": "37527148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37527148", "title": "Psychology of film", "text": "Psychology of film\n\nThe psychology of film is a sub-field of the psychology of art that studies the characteristics of film and its production in relation to perception, cognition, narrative understanding, and emotion. A growing number of psychological scientists and brain scientists have begun conducting empirical studies that describe the cognitive and biological underpinnings of motion pictures or what has been called \"psychocinematics\". Early theoretical approaches included works by psychologists Hugo Münsterberg and Rudolf Arnheim. Cognitive film theorists David Bordwell and Noël Carroll fostered its philosophical underpinnings.\n\nFilm is rather unusual as it involves an integration of visual and auditory stimuli. In narrative films, plots are guided by camera placement and movement, dialogue, sound effects, and editing. Some aspects of film are driven by bottom-up or sensory guided factors (such as light, motion or sound), whereas other aspects depend more on top-down or conceptually driven factors, like past experiences and internal motivations.\n\nCuts and flashbacks represent types of editing that alter the normal temporal sequencing of events, creating non-linear narrative structures. Editing creates the transition between events. Research focusing on recall ability for linear versus non-linear narratives suggests that temporal changes impact memory of events, but not comprehension.\n\nFilm cuts are instantaneous, perceptual, and sometimes temporal discontinuities that do not exist in our own realities. However, despite this, viewers accept cuts as a natural storytelling technique in film. Even though we see reality in a continuous flow of linked images, in movies, cuts seem to work, regardless of how experienced a viewer is. Walter Murch suggests that this is because viewers are in fact used to cuts in their everyday lives through the act of blinking. When you turn to look at an object, for example, you normally blink, thus creating a visual break in continuity between what you \"were\" looking at and what you are now looking at. Another possibility that Murch explores to explain humans’ innate acceptance of film cuts is the way in which we dream. Our dreams tend to jump around from place to place and situation to situation without any real sense of continuity. Thus the oneiric nature of films is familiar to viewers and allows them to innately understand the editing despite discontinuities.\n\nSchwan & Ildirar (2010), who focused solely on inexperienced viewers’ ability to comprehend film, found that the comprehensibility of films was determined by whether or not they followed a familiar line of action. Overall, our brains accept the perceptual discontinuities found in films, but it is ultimately easier for viewers, regardless of their experience, to understand cuts that follow a continuous and familiar line of action as opposed to ones that are more discontinuous. When a familiar line is not present, more experienced viewers are significantly better at comprehending a complex narrative by “filtering” out editing discontinuities. In the end, however, montage linearity that creates temporal continuity is more important than plot for recall and understanding of a narrative’s events.\n\nCognitive neuroscience research demonstrates that some movies can exert considerable control over brain activity and eye movements. Studying the neuroscience of film is based on the hypothesis that some films, or film segments, lead viewers through a similar sequence of perceptual, emotional and cognitive states. Using fMRI brain imaging, researchers asked participants to watch 30 minutes of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) as they lay on their backs in the MRI scanner. Despite the seemingly uncontrolled task and complex nature of the stimulus, brain activity was similar across viewers’ brains, particularly in spatiotemporal areas. When compared to a random sequence of scenes, the specific order of events seemed to be strongly associated with this similarity in brain activity. It was also determined that the level of control a movie has on someone’s mental state is highly dependent upon the cinematic devices (pans, cuts and close-ups) it contains. Tightly edited films exert more control on brain activity and eye-movement than open-ended films. However, similar eye-movement and similarity in visual processing does not guarantee similar brain responses. In addition, the average correlation in taste between individual viewers is rather low and not well predicted by film critics.\n\nViewing spaces on screen from a stable point of view is important for short-term spatial coding and long term spatial memory. Long-time viewers of the television show \"Friends\" were significantly better at accurately recalling spatial information about the show's set, because the camera never moves away from the \"fourth wall\". Equally experienced viewers of the show \"E.R.\" were less likely to recall information about the set and be able to mentally orient themselves inside it, because the show is filmed from many different angles.\n\nIn one study, observers were instructed to look at short movies involving changes in point of view. They used 15 movie clips featuring a handbag, whose properties (color, position, identity, and shape) were manipulated across cuts. Observers' reactions were recorded by examining eye-movement, changes in behavior and memory performance. The researchers later asked the observers if they had noticed anything unusual occur during the clips, without directly referring to the handbag. Changing the position of objects, i.e. the handbag, between scenes was the only variable that did not appear to affect eye-movement or memory. Overall, observers were more likely to draw their attention and look sooner at the handbag-stimulus at the moment right after its properties changed. When specifically asked about it, they were more likely to describe the handbag in terms of its post-cut properties, after a change had occurred. Even though their visual system appeared to pick up on the changes, observers were not consciously aware of them or able to report noticeable differences across cuts. The results illustrate that observers construct and maintain internal visual representations of complex visual environments while viewing dynamic scenes. This also helps explain why movie viewers usually are not aware of continuity errors in editing.\n\nCinematic techniques are often regarded as grammatical structures or components of the cinematic art as a language made up of images. \nA period of visual adaptation is necessary before being able to understand images in movies or on television. Viewers need sufficient exposure to cinematic techniques and the meanings attributed to them to adequately interpret the images on the screen. At a very young age, we learn how to watch videos and understand different editing techniques. One study looked at adult participants who had very little exposure to film to see if they were able to understand simple editing techniques, such as point of view shots, establishing shots, pan shots, shot/reverse shot, ellipsis of time, and cross-cutting. These viewers were able to understand some of the techniques, such as ellipses of time; however, more complex techniques, like shot/reverse shot were more difficult for them to understand.\n\nSome filmmaking techniques derive meaning through past experiences or ideologies that influence the way viewers see certain images or sequence of images. An example of this would be how camera angles can affect our perception of what is occurring on screen. Low angle shots in which the camera is pointed up at a subject tend to make the subject appear more powerful or stronger. While high angle shots can make a subject appear weaker. These interpretations of camera angles, however, ultimately derive from the notion that bigger is better. The lateral movement of a subject across the screen can also influence an audience's interpretation of the subject. For example, characters that move from left-to-right are perceived more positively than characters who move right-to-left. This partiality toward rightward movement likely has its roots in the predominance of right-handedness in society, as well as the practice of reading left-to-right in Western languages.\n\nOne study compiled data on the changing trends in techniques by examining 160 English-language films released from 1935-2010. The findings demonstrate that over time shot lengths have become shorter, while the shorter the shot the more motion it is likely to contain. In addition, contemporary films have significantly more motion and movement than older ones. Motion is the optical change created by moving objects, people, and shadows; movement is that change created by camera motion or gradual lens change.\nPresumably, the film industry has capitalized on the results of previous psychological research that shows motion and the onset of motion capture our attention.\nFinally, films have become darker over time, as the overall brightness of the images on the movie screen has decreased.\n\nThese changes in film-making choices increase attention manipulation and are thought to facilitate comprehension.\n\nTop-down factors refer to expectations and background knowledge that influence viewers' perception, understanding and appreciation of film. Expertise, attention and eye-movements are top-down factors that guide how viewers experience film.\n\nExplicit awareness about the processes by which meaning is created by the visual media could be regarded as one measure of film expertise and sophistication. Increased awareness of the subtle techniques employed by filmmakers to “manipulate” audiences leads to increased admiration and aesthetic responses to film, as in other forms of visual art. \nResearchers have identified a strong relationship between prior film experience and conscious awareness of visual manipulations, especially for people with practical experience in production.\n\nOne study compared the participants’ ability to understand narrative in Hollywood versus experimental film, by measuring interpretational awareness. Subjects with significant, moderate and no formal background or experience in film viewed a film that contained both scenes with Hollywood-style and experimental-style editing. Regardless of expertise level, participants described the Hollywood-like scenes in “naturalistic terms,” as if their events had occurred in reality and tended not to make explicit references to stylistic techniques. This interpretational tendency reflects Hollywood’s “invisible style.” When describing the experimental scenes, inexperienced viewers struggled to construct a cohesive “naturalistic” narrative. More experienced viewers were more likely to make explicit reference to the “breaking of conventions” and the intentions behind them.\n\nFilm editing seems to be a barrier of awareness for conventional Hollywood-type movies, as they create an illusion of “real life”.\n\nSegmentation or event segmentation is a fundamental component of attention that facilitates understanding, object recognition and planning. Event segmentation constitutes breaking down dynamic scenes into spatial and temporal parts or units of events.\n\nEvent segmentation is viewed as “the brain’s cutting-room floor.” \nIt is considered to be an automatic and ongoing process that depends on meaningful changes in a perceived situation. To test this, researchers measured brain activity while participants viewed an extended narrative film. They used MRI scanning to show transient evoked brain responses (changes in brain activity) at those points they identified as event boundaries (changes in situation). Situational changes were coded frame by frame into spatial, temporal, object, character, causal and goal changes. Participants were then instructed to perform an event segmentation task by watching a movie and pressing a button to identify units of activity that were natural and meaningful to them. Paying attention to situational changes gives rise to a neural cascade that is consciously perceived at the end of one event and the beginning of another.\n\nAccording to Event Segmentation Theory (EST), the perception of event boundaries is a side effect of prediction during ongoing perception. Prediction is an adaptive mechanism made up of cognitive event models that represent “what is going on now” to create expectations and attentive biases for ongoing processing. Prediction errors occur at situational changes and cause information processing segmentation.\n\nBroader narrative comprehension theories have also been applied to the perception and memory of movies. This reflects the hypothesis that the same mechanisms are used to understanding stories and real life. In one study, researchers illustrated the common episodic structure between text and film, by asking participants to match a constructed text story to the dialogueless movie The Red Balloon. This task required participants to locate episodes and their components within the cinematic story: exposition, complication and resolution.\n\nUsing an eyetracker, researchers have discovered a strong center-of-screen bias with a distribution of gaze points approximately peaking at the screen center. However, eye gazes rarely focus on the same location. Visual dispersion across the screen increases over time and particularly, after repeated exposure to the same video stimulus. Because of this, there is greater gaze dispersion when viewers are watching advertisements compared to a television show.\n\n"}
{"id": "263437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=263437", "title": "Robert Armin", "text": "Robert Armin\n\nRobert Armin (c. 1563 – 1615) was an English actor, a member of the Lord Chamberlain's Men. He became the leading comedy actor with the troupe associated with William Shakespeare following the departure of Will Kempe around 1600. Also a popular comic author, he wrote a comedy, \"The History of the Two Maids of More-clacke\", as well as \"Foole upon Foole\", \"A Nest of Ninnies\" (1608) and \"The Italian Taylor and his Boy\".\n\nArmin changed the part of the clown or fool from the rustic servingman turned comedian to that of a high-comedy domestic wit.\n\nArmin was one of three children born to John Armyn II of King's Lynn, a successful tailor and friend to John Lonyson, a goldsmith also of King's Lynn. His brother, John Armyn III, was a merchant tailor in London. Armin did not take up his father's craft; instead, his father apprenticed him to Lonyson in the Goldsmiths' Company in 1581. Lonyson was the Master of Works at the Royal Mint in the Tower of London, a position of great responsibility. The arrangement moved Armin to a life and a social circle quite different from what he might have expected as a Norfolk tailor. Lonyson died in 1582, and the apprenticeship was transferred to another master. According to a tale preserved in \"Tarlton's Jests\", Armin came to the attention of the Queen's famous jester Richard Tarlton. In the course of his duties, the story contends, Armin was sent to collect money from a lodger at Tarlton's inn. Frustrated by the man's refusal to pay, Armin wrote verses in chalk on the wall; Tarlton noticed and, approving their wit, wrote an answer in which he expressed a desire to take Armin as his apprentice. Though not corroborated, this anecdote is far from the least plausible in \"Tarlton's Jests\". Influenced by Tarlton or not, Armin already had a literary reputation before he finished his apprenticeship in 1592. In 1590, his name is affixed to the preface of a religious tract, \"A Brief Resolution of the Right Religion\". Two years later, both Thomas Nashe (in \"Strange News\") and Gabriel Harvey (in \"Pierce's Supererogation\") mention him as a writer of ballads; none of his work in this vein, however, is known to have survived.\n\nAt some point in the 1590s, Armin joined a company of players patronised by William Brydges, 4th Baron Chandos. With this company, about which little is known, he is presumed to have travelled from the western Midlands to East Anglia. The nature of his work for the company may be estimated from his parts in \"The History of the Two Maids of More-clacke\". The preface to the 1609 quarto indicates that he played Blue John, a clown in the vein of Tarlton and Kempe; he also seems to have doubled in the role of Tutch, a witty fool of the type he later played in London. The late quarto is associated with a revival by the King's Revels Children, a short-lived troupe of boy players led by Nathan Field, but it was almost certainly written around 1597.\n\nLittle else is known precisely of Armin's time with Chandos's Men. A dedication to his patron's widow in 1604 suggests some personal acquaintance with the Brydges family; on the other hand, a reference in another work suggests he may have spent some time, like Kempe, as a solo performer. The pair of books Armin published around the turn of the century demonstrate a performer with an interest in his craft. \"Fool Upon Fool\" (1600, 1605; reissued in 1608 as \"A Nest of Ninnies\"), offers the wit of assorted natural fools, some of whom Armin knew personally. The same year he published \"Quips upon Questions\", a collection of seemingly extemporaneous dialogues with his marotte, named by him Signor Truncheon. In this he demonstrates his style; instead of having a conversation with the audience, as Tarlton did, and entering into a battle of wits, he jests using multiple personas, improvised song, or by commenting on a person or event. Rather than exchanging words, he gave words freely. Armin reported in that work that on either Tuesday 25 December 1599, or Tuesday 1 January 1600, he would be travelling to Hackney to wait on his \"right honourable good lord\". This was possibly Baron Chandos, who may have been visiting Edward la Zouche, 11th Baron Zouche over the holidays, or more likely Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford who lived in Hackney.\n\nThe first editions of these two books were credited to \"Clonnico de Curtanio Snuffe\"—that is, to the \"Clown of the Curtain\". The 1605 edition changes \"Curtain\" to \"Mundo\" (that is, Globe); only in 1608 was he credited by name, though the earlier title pages would have sufficed to identify him for Londoners.\n\nAnother work of uncertain date (it was published in 1609) is \"The Italian Tailor and his Boy\". A translation of a tale from Gianfrancesco Straparola, the subject matter may reflect his family background of tailors. He was a tailor's son, who paralleled in the Italian tailor's apprentice, and the ruby ring of the play's lore parallels the goldsmith apprentice.\n\nSutcliffe argues that Armin wrote a pamphlet published in 1599, \"A Pil to Purge Melancholie\", on the grounds that it was published by the same press, mentions a clown with Armin's nickname, and contains verbal echoes of \"Two Maids of More-clacke\".\n\nThe timing of Armin's joining the Chamberlain's Men is as mysterious as its occasion. That it was connected to Kempe's departure has been generally accepted; however, the reasons for that departure are not clear. One traditional view—that the company in general or Shakespeare specifically had begun to tire of Kempe's old-fashioned clowning—is still current, though the main evidence for this view consists of Kempe's departure and the type of comic roles Shakespeare wrote after 1600. Armin played on the Globe stage by August 1600; Wiles theorizes that he may have joined the Chamberlain's Men in 1599, but continued to perform solo pieces at the Curtain; however, he may also have played with the company at the Curtain, while Kempe was still a member.\n\nArmin is generally credited with all the \"licensed fools\" in the repertory of the Chamberlain's and King's Men: Touchstone in \"As You Like It\", Feste in \"Twelfth Night\", the Fool in \"King Lear\", Lavatch in \"All's Well That Ends Well\", and perhaps Thersites in \"Troilus and Cressida\", the Porter in \"Macbeth\", the Fool in \"Timon of Athens\", and Autolycus in \"The Winter's Tale\". Of these eight, Touchstone is the fool about which there is the most critical discussion. Harold Bloom describes him as \"rancidly vicious,\" and writes that \"this more intense rancidity works as a touchstone should, to prove the true gold of Rosalind's spirit\". John Palmer disagrees and writes that \"he must be either a true cynic or one that affects his cynicism to mask a fundamentally genial spirit\". Obviously, as Palmer continues, a true cynic does not belong in Arden, so the clown \"must be a thoroughly good fellow at heart\". Touchstone affects the front of a malcontented cynic, thus serving as proof of Rosalind's quick wit. When she confronts both Jaques and Touchstone, she exposes their silliness and prevents the fools from making Arden out to be worse than it really is.\n\nFeste was almost certainly written for Armin, as he is a scholar, a singer, and a wit. Feste's purpose is to reveal the foolishness of those around him. Lear's fool differs from both Touchstone and Feste as well as from other clowns of his era. Touchstone and Feste are philosopher-fools; Lear's fool is the natural fool of whom Armin studied and wrote. Armin here had the opportunity to display his studies. The fool speaks the prophecy lines, which he tells—largely ignored—to Lear before disappearing from the play altogether. Lear's fool is hardly around for entertainment purposes; rather, he is present to forward the plot, remain loyal to the king, and perhaps to stall his madness.\n\nAlthough Armin typically played these intelligent clown roles, it has been suggested by a few scholars that he originated the role of Iago in \"Othello\", on the grounds that Iago sings two drinking songs (most of the songs in Shakespeare's plays from 1600 to 1610 were sung by Armin's characters) and that this was the sole play between \"As You Like It\" and \"Timon of Athens\" that has no fool or clown for Armin to play.\n\nIn non-Shakespearean roles, he probably played Pasarello in John Marston's \"The Malcontent\"; indeed, Marston may have added the part for him when the play was produced by the King's Men. Armin appears in the cast list for Ben Jonson's \"The Alchemist\"; he may have played Drugger. He is also presumed to have been the clown in George Wilkins's \"The Miseries of Enforced Marriage\".\n\nHe is not named in the cast list for Jonson's \"Catiline\" (1611), and other evidence suggests that he retired in 1609 or 1610. The preface to the \"Two Maids\" quarto confides, \"I would have again enacted John myself, but \"tempora mutantur in illis\", and I cannot do as I would\". He was buried in late 1615.\n\nIn London, he resided in the parish of St Botolph's Aldgate; three of his children named in the parish register appear to have died before adulthood. Fellow King's Man Augustine Phillips bequeathed him twenty shillings as a \"fellow\"; John Davies of Hereford wrote Armin a complimentary epigram. His burial is recorded in the Registers of St Botolph's as 30 November 1615.\n\nArmin may have played a key role in the development of Shakespearian fools. \"If any player breathed,\" Hotson tells us, \"who could explore with Shakespeare the shadows and fitful flashes of the borderland of insanity, that player was Armin\". Robert Armin explored every aspect of the clown, from the natural idiot to the philosopher-fool; from serving man to retained jester. In study, writing, and performance, Armin moved the fool from rustic zany to trained motley. His characters—those he wrote and those he acted—absurdly point out the absurdity of what is otherwise called normal. Instead of appealing to the identity of the English commoner by imitating them, he created a new fool, a high-comic jester for whom wisdom is wit and wit is wisdom.\nWhen Robert Armin replaced Kemp in the Chamberlain's Men, it was considered the \"taming of the clown\". Armin's new style of comedy brought into play the \"world-wisely fool\". This urged Shakespeare to create Feste in his \"Twelfth Night\", who was a philosophical social insurgence. He had a place everywhere, but belonged nowhere.\nKen Kesey told an interviewer of this notion of a fool. \"That fool of Shakespeare's, the actor Robert Armin, became so popular that finally Shakespeare wrote him out of Henry IV. In a book called \"A Nest of Ninnies\", Armin wrote about the difference between a fool artificial and a fool natural. And the way Armin defines the two is important: the character Jack Oates is a true fool natural. He never stops being a fool to save himself; he never tries to do anything but anger his master, Sir William. A fool artificial is always trying to please; he’s a lackey.\"\n\nRobert Armin is a significant character in Gary Blackwood's historical fiction \"The Shakespeare Stealer\".\n\nIn the 1991 Pamela Dean novel \"Tam Lin\", one of the major characters is Robert Armin (better known as Robin), a Classics and Theater student at a small college in the Midwestern U.S. during the early 1970s who has a surprisingly detailed knowledge of William Shakespeare's life and work.\n\n"}
{"id": "26094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26094", "title": "Romanticism", "text": "Romanticism\n\nRomanticism (also known as the Romantic era) was an artistic, literary, musical and intellectual movement that originated in Europe toward the end of the 18th century, and in most areas was at its peak in the approximate period from 1800 to 1850. Romanticism was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature, preferring the medieval rather than the classical. It was partly a reaction to the Industrial Revolution, the aristocratic social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment, and the scientific rationalization of nature—all components of modernity. It was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature, but had a major impact on historiography, education, the social sciences, and the natural sciences. It had a significant and complex effect on politics, with romantic thinkers influencing liberalism, radicalism, conservatism and nationalism.\n\nThe movement emphasized intense emotion as an authentic source of aesthetic experience, placing new emphasis on such emotions as apprehension, horror and terror, and awe—especially that experienced in confronting the new aesthetic categories of the sublimity and beauty of nature. It elevated folk art and ancient custom to something noble, but also spontaneity as a desirable characteristic (as in the musical impromptu). In contrast to the Rationalism and Classicism of the Enlightenment, Romanticism revived medievalism and elements of art and narrative perceived as authentically medieval in an attempt to escape population growth, early urban sprawl, and industrialism.\n\nAlthough the movement was rooted in the German \"Sturm und Drang\" movement, which preferred intuition and emotion to the rationalism of the Enlightenment, the events and ideologies of the French Revolution were also proximate factors. Romanticism assigned a high value to the achievements of \"heroic\" individualists and artists, whose examples, it maintained, would raise the quality of society. It also promoted the individual imagination as a critical authority allowed of freedom from classical notions of form in art. There was a strong recourse to historical and natural inevitability, a \"Zeitgeist\", in the representation of its ideas. In the second half of the 19th century, Realism was offered as a polar opposite to Romanticism. The decline of Romanticism during this time was associated with multiple processes, including social and political changes and the spread of nationalism.\n\nThe nature of Romanticism may be approached from the primary importance of the free expression of the feelings of the artist. The importance the Romantics placed on emotion is summed up in the remark of the German painter Caspar David Friedrich, \"the artist's feeling is his law\". To William Wordsworth, poetry should begin as \"the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings\", which the poet then \"recollect[s] in tranquility\", evoking a new but corresponding emotion the poet can then mold into art.\n\nTo express these feelings, it was considered the content of art had to come from the imagination of the artist, with as little interference as possible from \"artificial\" rules dictating what a work should consist of. Samuel Taylor Coleridge and others believed there were natural laws the imagination—at least of a good creative artist—would unconsciously follow through artistic inspiration if left alone. As well as rules, the influence of models from other works was considered to impede the creator's own imagination, so that originality was essential. The concept of the genius, or artist who was able to produce his own original work through this process of \"creation from nothingness\", is key to Romanticism, and to be derivative was the worst sin. This idea is often called \"romantic originality.\" Translator and prominent Romantic August Wilhelm Schlegel argued in his \"Lectures on Dramatic Arts and Letters\" that the most phenomenal power of human nature is its capacity to divide and diverge into opposite directions.\nNot essential to Romanticism, but so widespread as to be normative, was a strong belief and interest in the importance of nature. This particularly in the effect of nature upon the artist when he is surrounded by it, preferably alone. In contrast to the usually very social art of the Enlightenment, Romantics were distrustful of the human world, and tended to believe a close connection with nature was mentally and morally healthy. Romantic art addressed its audiences with what was intended to be felt as the personal voice of the artist. So, in literature, \"much of romantic poetry invited the reader to identify the protagonists with the poets themselves\".\n\nAccording to Isaiah Berlin, Romanticism embodied \"a new and restless spirit, seeking violently to burst through old and cramping forms, a nervous preoccupation with perpetually changing inner states of consciousness, a longing for the unbounded and the indefinable, for perpetual movement and change, an effort to return to the forgotten sources of life, a passionate effort at self-assertion both individual and collective, a search after means of expressing an unappeasable yearning for unattainable goals.\"\n\nThe group of words with the root \"Roman\" in the various European languages, such as \"romance\" and \"Romanesque\", has a complicated history, but by the middle of the 18th century \"romantic\" in English and \"romantique\" in French were both in common use as adjectives of praise for natural phenomena such as views and sunsets, in a sense close to modern English usage but without the amorous connotation. The application of the term to literature first became common in Germany, where the circle around the Schlegel brothers, critics August and Friedrich, began to speak of \"romantische Poesie\" (\"romantic poetry\") in the 1790s, contrasting it with \"classic\" but in terms of spirit rather than merely dating. Friedrich Schlegel wrote in his \"Dialogue on Poetry\" (1800), \"I seek and find the romantic among the older moderns, in Shakespeare, in Cervantes, in Italian poetry, in that age of chivalry, love and fable, from which the phenomenon and the word itself are derived.\"\n\nIn both French and German the closeness of the adjective to \"roman\", meaning the fairly new literary form of the novel, had some effect on the sense of the word in those languages. The use of the word, invented by Friedrich Schlegel, did not become general very quickly, and was probably spread more widely in France by its persistent use by Germaine de Staël in her \"De l'Allemagne\" (1813), recounting her travels in Germany. In England Wordsworth wrote in a preface to his poems of 1815 of the \"romantic harp\" and \"classic lyre\", but in 1820 Byron could still write, perhaps slightly disingenuously, \"I perceive that in Germany, as well as in Italy, there is a great struggle about what they call 'Classical' and 'Romantic', terms which were not subjects of classification in England, at least when I left it four or five years ago\". It is only from the 1820s that Romanticism certainly knew itself by its name, and in 1824 the Académie française took the wholly ineffective step of issuing a decree condemning it in literature.\n\nThe period typically called Romantic varies greatly between different countries and different artistic media or areas of thought. Margaret Drabble described it in literature as taking place \"roughly between 1770 and 1848\", and few dates much earlier than 1770 will be found. In English literature, M. H. Abrams placed it between 1789, or 1798, this latter a very typical view, and about 1830, perhaps a little later than some other critics. Others have proposed 1780–1830. In other fields and other countries the period denominated as Romantic can be considerably different; musical Romanticism, for example, is generally regarded as only having ceased as a major artistic force as late as 1910, but in an extreme extension the \"Four Last Songs\" of Richard Strauss are described stylistically as \"Late Romantic\" and were composed in 1946–48. However, in most fields the Romantic Period is said to be over by about 1850, or earlier.\n\nThe early period of the Romantic Era was a time of war, with the French Revolution (1789–1799) followed by the Napoleonic Wars until 1815. These wars, along with the political and social turmoil that went along with them, served as the background for Romanticism. The key generation of French Romantics born between 1795–1805 had, in the words of one of their number, Alfred de Vigny, been \"conceived between battles, attended school to the rolling of drums\". According to Jacques Barzun, there were three generations of Romantic artists. The first emerged in the 1790s and 1800s, the second in the 1820s, and the third later in the century.\n\nThe more precise characterization and specific definition of Romanticism has been the subject of debate in the fields of intellectual history and literary history throughout the 20th century, without any great measure of consensus emerging. That it was part of the Counter-Enlightenment, a reaction against the Age of Enlightenment, is generally accepted in current scholarship. Its relationship to the French Revolution, which began in 1789 in the very early stages of the period, is clearly important, but highly variable depending on geography and individual reactions. Most Romantics can be said to be broadly progressive in their views, but a considerable number always had, or developed, a wide range of conservative views, and nationalism was in many countries strongly associated with Romanticism, as discussed in detail below.\n\nIn philosophy and the history of ideas, Romanticism was seen by Isaiah Berlin as disrupting for over a century the classic Western traditions of rationality and the idea of moral absolutes and agreed values, leading \"to something like the melting away of the very notion of objective truth\", and hence not only to nationalism, but also fascism and totalitarianism, with a gradual recovery coming only after World War II. For the Romantics, Berlin says, in the realm of ethics, politics, aesthetics it was the authenticity and sincerity of the pursuit of inner goals that mattered; this applied equally to individuals and groups—states, nations, movements. This is most evident in the aesthetics of romanticism, where the notion of eternal models, a Platonic vision of ideal beauty, which the artist seeks to convey, however imperfectly, on canvas or in sound, is replaced by a passionate belief in spiritual freedom, individual creativity. The painter, the poet, the composer do not hold up a mirror to nature, however ideal, but invent; they do not imitate (the doctrine of mimesis), but create not merely the means but the goals that they pursue; these goals represent the self-expression of the artist's own unique, inner vision, to set aside which in response to the demands of some \"external\" voice—church, state, public opinion, family friends, arbiters of taste—is an act of betrayal of what alone justifies their existence for those who are in any sense creative.\nArthur Lovejoy attempted to demonstrate the difficulty of defining Romanticism in his seminal article \"On The Discrimination of Romanticisms\" in his \"Essays in the History of Ideas\" (1948); some scholars see Romanticism as essentially continuous with the present, some like Robert Hughes see in it the inaugural moment of modernity, and some like Chateaubriand, Novalis and Samuel Taylor Coleridge see it as the beginning of a tradition of resistance to Enlightenment rationalism—a \"Counter-Enlightenment\"— to be associated most closely with German Romanticism. An earlier definition comes from Charles Baudelaire: \"Romanticism is precisely situated neither in choice of subject nor exact truth, but in the way of feeling.\"\n\nThe end of the Romantic era is marked in some areas by a new style of Realism, which affected literature, especially the novel and drama, painting, and even music, through Verismo opera. This movement was led by France, with Balzac and Flaubert in literature and Courbet in painting; Stendhal and Goya were important precursors of Realism in their respective media. However, Romantic styles, now often representing the established and safe style against which Realists rebelled, continued to flourish in many fields for the rest of the century and beyond. In music such works from after about 1850 are referred to by some writers as \"Late Romantic\" and by others as \"Neoromantic\" or \"Postromantic\", but other fields do not usually use these terms; in English literature and painting the convenient term \"Victorian\" avoids having to characterise the period further.\n\nIn northern Europe, the Early Romantic visionary optimism and belief that the world was in the process of great change and improvement had largely vanished, and some art became more conventionally political and polemical as its creators engaged polemically with the world as it was. Elsewhere, including in very different ways the United States and Russia, feelings that great change was underway or just about to come were still possible. Displays of intense emotion in art remained prominent, as did the exotic and historical settings pioneered by the Romantics, but experimentation with form and technique was generally reduced, often replaced with meticulous technique, as in the poems of Tennyson or many paintings. If not realist, late 19th-century art was often extremely detailed, and pride was taken in adding authentic details in a way that earlier Romantics did not trouble with. Many Romantic ideas about the nature and purpose of art, above all the pre-eminent importance of originality, remained important for later generations, and often underlie modern views, despite opposition from theorists.\n\nIn literature, Romanticism found recurrent themes in the evocation or criticism of the past, the cult of \"sensibility\" with its emphasis on women and children, the isolation of the artist or narrator, and respect for nature. Furthermore, several romantic authors, such as Edgar Allan Poe and Nathaniel Hawthorne, based their writings on the supernatural/occult and human psychology. Romanticism tended to regard satire as something unworthy of serious attention, a prejudice still influential today. The romantic movement in literature was preceded by the Enlightenment and succeeded by Realism.\n\nSome authors cite 16th century poet Isabella di Morra as an early precursor of Romantic literature. Her lyrics covering themes of isolation and loneliness, which reflected the tragic events of her life, are considered \"an impressive prefigurement of Romanticism\", differing from the Petrarchist fashion of the time based on the philosophy of love.\n\nThe precursors of Romanticism in English poetry go back to the middle of the 18th century, including figures such as Joseph Warton (headmaster at Winchester College) and his brother Thomas Warton, Professor of Poetry at Oxford University. Joseph maintained that invention and imagination were the chief qualities of a poet. Thomas Chatterton is generally considered the first Romantic poet in English. The Scottish poet James Macpherson influenced the early development of Romanticism with the international success of his Ossian cycle of poems published in 1762, inspiring both Goethe and the young Walter Scott. Both Chatterton and Macpherson's work involved elements of fraud, as what they claimed was earlier literature that they had discovered or compiled was, in fact, entirely their own work. The Gothic novel, beginning with Horace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto\" (1764), was an important precursor of one strain of Romanticism, with a delight in horror and threat, and exotic picturesque settings, matched in Walpole's case by his role in the early revival of Gothic architecture. \"Tristram Shandy\", a novel by Laurence Sterne (1759–67) introduced a whimsical version of the anti-rational sentimental novel to the English literary public.\n\nAn early German influence came from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, whose 1774 novel \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\" had young men throughout Europe emulating its protagonist, a young artist with a very sensitive and passionate temperament. At that time Germany was a multitude of small separate states, and Goethe's works would have a seminal influence in developing a unifying sense of nationalism. Another philosophic influence came from the German idealism of Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Friedrich Schelling, making Jena (where Fichte lived, as well as Schelling, Hegel, Schiller and the brothers Schlegel) a center for early German Romanticism (see Jena Romanticism). Important writers were Ludwig Tieck, Novalis (\"Heinrich von Ofterdingen\", 1799), Heinrich von Kleist and Friedrich Hölderlin. Heidelberg later became a center of German Romanticism, where writers and poets such as Clemens Brentano, Achim von Arnim, and Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff (\"Aus dem Leben eines Taugenichts\") met regularly in literary circles.\n\nImportant motifs in German Romanticism are travelling, nature, for example the German Forest, and Germanic myths. The later German Romanticism of, for example E. T. A. Hoffmann's \"Der Sandmann\" (\"The Sandman\"), 1817, and Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff's \"Das Marmorbild\" (\"The Marble Statue\"), 1819, was darker in its motifs and has gothic elements. The significance to Romanticism of childhood innocence, the importance of imagination, and racial theories all combined to give an unprecedented importance to folk literature, non-classical mythology and children's literature, above all in Germany. Brentano and von Arnim were significant literary figures who together published \"Des Knaben Wunderhorn\" (\"The Boy's Magic Horn\" or cornucopia), a collection of versified folk tales, in 1806–08. The first collection of \"Grimms' Fairy Tales\" by the Brothers Grimm was published in 1812. Unlike the much later work of Hans Christian Andersen, who was publishing his invented tales in Danish from 1835, these German works were at least mainly based on collected folk tales, and the Grimms remained true to the style of the telling in their early editions, though later rewriting some parts. One of the brothers, Jacob, published in 1835 \"Deutsche Mythologie\", a long academic work on Germanic mythology. Another strain is exemplified by Schiller's highly emotional language and the depiction of physical violence in his play \"The Robbers\" of 1781.\n\nIn English literature, the key figures of the Romantic movement are considered to be the group of poets including William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Keats, Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and the much older William Blake, followed later by the isolated figure of John Clare; also such novelists as Walter Scott from Scotland and Mary Shelley, and the essayists William Hazlitt and Charles Lamb. The publication in 1798 of \"Lyrical Ballads\", with many of the finest poems by Wordsworth and Coleridge, is often held to mark the start of the movement. The majority of the poems were by Wordsworth, and many dealt with the lives of the poor in his native Lake District, or his feelings about nature—which he more fully developed in his long poem \"The Prelude\", never published in his lifetime. The longest poem in the volume was Coleridge's \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", which showed the Gothic side of English Romanticism, and the exotic settings that many works featured. In the period when they were writing, the Lake Poets were widely regarded as a marginal group of radicals, though they were supported by the critic and writer William Hazlitt and others.\nIn contrast Lord Byron and Walter Scott achieved enormous fame and influence throughout Europe with works exploiting the violence and drama of their exotic and historical settings; Goethe called Byron \"undoubtedly the greatest genius of our century\". Scott achieved immediate success with his long narrative poem \"The Lay of the Last Minstrel\" in 1805, followed by the full epic poem \"Marmion\" in 1808. Both were set in the distant Scottish past, already evoked in \"Ossian\"; Romanticism and Scotland were to have a long and fruitful partnership. Byron had equal success with the first part of \"Childe Harold's Pilgrimage\" in 1812, followed by four \"Turkish tales\", all in the form of long poems, starting with \"The Giaour\" in 1813, drawing from his Grand Tour, which had reached Ottoman Europe, and orientalizing the themes of the Gothic novel in verse. These featured different variations of the \"Byronic hero\", and his own life contributed a further version. Scott meanwhile was effectively inventing the historical novel, beginning in 1814 with \"Waverley\", set in the 1745 Jacobite rising, which was an enormous and highly profitable success, followed by over 20 further Waverley Novels over the next 17 years, with settings going back to the Crusades that he had researched to a degree that was new in literature.\n\nIn contrast to Germany, Romanticism in English literature had little connection with nationalism, and the Romantics were often regarded with suspicion for the sympathy many felt for the ideals of the French Revolution, whose collapse and replacement with the dictatorship of Napoleon was, as elsewhere in Europe, a shock to the movement. Though his novels celebrated Scottish identity and history, Scott was politically a firm Unionist, but admitted to Jacobite sympathies. Several spent much time abroad, and a famous stay on Lake Geneva with Byron and Shelley in 1816 produced the hugely influential novel \"Frankenstein\" by Shelley's wife-to-be Mary Shelley and the novella \"The Vampyre\" by Byron's doctor John William Polidori. The lyrics of Robert Burns in Scotland and Thomas Moore, from Ireland reflected in different ways their countries and the Romantic interest in folk literature, but neither had a fully Romantic approach to life or their work.\n\nThough they have modern critical champions such as György Lukács, Scott's novels are today more likely to be experienced in the form of the many operas that composers continued to base on them over the following decades, such as Donizetti's \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" and Vincenzo Bellini's \"I puritani\" (both 1835). Byron is now most highly regarded for his short lyrics and his generally unromantic prose writings, especially his letters, and his unfinished satire \"Don Juan\". Unlike many Romantics, Byron's widely publicised personal life appeared to match his work, and his death at 36 in 1824 from disease when helping the Greek War of Independence appeared from a distance to be a suitably Romantic end, entrenching his legend. Keats in 1821 and Shelley in 1822 both died in Italy, Blake (at almost 70) in 1827, and Coleridge largely ceased to write in the 1820s. Wordsworth was by 1820 respectable and highly regarded, holding a government sinecure, but wrote relatively little. In the discussion of English literature, the Romantic period is often regarded as finishing around the 1820s, or sometimes even earlier, although many authors of the succeeding decades were no less committed to Romantic values.\n\nThe most significant novelist in English during the peak Romantic period, other than Walter Scott, was Jane Austen, whose essentially conservative world-view had little in common with her Romantic contemporaries, retaining a strong belief in decorum and social rules, though critics have detected tremors under the surface of some works, especially \"Mansfield Park\" (1814) and \"Persuasion\" (1817). But around the mid-century the undoubtedly Romantic novels of the Yorkshire-based Brontë family appeared. Most notably Charlotte's \"Jane Eyre\" and Emily's \"Wuthering Heights\", both published in 1847, which also introduced more gothic themes. While these two novels were written and published after the Romantic period is said to have ended, their novels were heavily influenced by Romantic literature they'd read as children.\n\nByron, Keats and Shelley all wrote for the stage, but with little success in England, with Shelley's \"The Cenci\" perhaps the best work produced, though that was not played in a public theatre in England until a century after his death. Byron's plays, along with dramatizations of his poems and Scott's novels, were much more popular on the Continent, and especially in France, and through these versions several were turned into operas, many still performed today. If contemporary poets had little success on the stage, the period was a legendary one for performances of Shakespeare, and went some way to restoring his original texts and removing the Augustan \"improvements\" to them. The greatest actor of the period, Edmund Kean, restored the tragic ending to \"King Lear\"; Coleridge said that, \"Seeing him act was like reading Shakespeare by flashes of lightning.\"\n\nAlthough after union with England in 1707 Scotland increasingly adopted English language and wider cultural norms, its literature developed a distinct national identity and began to enjoy an international reputation. Allan Ramsay (1686–1758) laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature, as well as leading the trend for pastoral poetry, helping to develop the Habbie stanza as a poetic form. James Macpherson (1736–96) was the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation. Claiming to have found poetry written by the ancient bard Ossian, he published translations that acquired international popularity, being proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the Classical epics. \"Fingal\", written in 1762, was speedily translated into many European languages, and its appreciation of natural beauty and treatment of the ancient legend has been credited more than any single work with bringing about the Romantic movement in European, and especially in German literature, through its influence on Johann Gottfried von Herder and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. It was also popularised in France by figures that included Napoleon. Eventually it became clear that the poems were not direct translations from the Gaelic, but flowery adaptations made to suit the aesthetic expectations of his audience.\n\nRobert Burns (1759–96) and Walter Scott (1771–1832) were highly influenced by the Ossian cycle. Burns, an Ayrshire poet and lyricist, is widely regarded as the national poet of Scotland and a major influence on the Romantic movement. His poem (and song) \"Auld Lang Syne\" is often sung at Hogmanay (the last day of the year), and \"Scots Wha Hae\" served for a long time as an unofficial national anthem of the country. Scott began as a poet and also collected and published Scottish ballads. His first prose work, \"Waverley\" in 1814, is often called the first historical novel. It launched a highly successful career, with other historical novels such as \"Rob Roy\" (1817), \"The Heart of Midlothian\" (1818) and \"Ivanhoe\" (1820). Scott probably did more than any other figure to define and popularise Scottish cultural identity in the nineteenth century. Other major literary figures connected with Romanticism include the poets and novelists James Hogg (1770–1835), Allan Cunningham (1784–1842) and John Galt (1779–1839). One of the most significant figures of the Romantic movement, Lord Byron, was brought up in Scotland until he inherited his family's English peerage.\n\nScottish \"national drama\" emerged in the early 1800s, as plays with specifically Scottish themes began to dominate the Scottish stage. Theatres had been discouraged by the Church of Scotland and fears of Jacobite assemblies. In the later eighteenth century, many plays were written for and performed by small amateur companies and were not published and so most have been lost. Towards the end of the century there were \"closet dramas\", primarily designed to be read, rather than performed, including work by Scott, Hogg, Galt and Joanna Baillie (1762–1851), often influenced by the ballad tradition and Gothic Romanticism.\n\nRomanticism was relatively late in developing in French literature, more so than in the visual arts. The 18th-century precursor to Romanticism, the cult of sensibility, had become associated with the Ancien regime, and the French Revolution had been more of an inspiration to foreign writers than those experiencing it at first-hand. The first major figure was François-René de Chateaubriand, a minor aristocrat who had remained a royalist throughout the Revolution, and returned to France from exile in England and America under Napoleon, with whose regime he had an uneasy relationship. His writings, all in prose, included some fiction, such as his influential novella of exile \"René\" (1802), which anticipated Byron in its alienated hero, but mostly contemporary history and politics, his travels, a defence of religion and the medieval spirit (\"Génie du christianisme\" 1802), and finally in the 1830s and 1840s his enormous autobiography \"Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe\" (\"Memoirs from beyond the grave\").\n\nAfter the Bourbon Restoration, French Romanticism developed in the lively world of Parisian theatre, with productions of Shakespeare, Schiller (in France a key Romantic author), and adaptations of Scott and Byron alongside French authors, several of whom began to write in the late 1820s. Cliques of pro- and anti-Romantics developed, and productions were often accompanied by raucous vocalizing by the two sides, including the shouted assertion by one theatregoer in 1822 that \"Shakespeare, c'est l'aide-de-camp de Wellington\" (\"Shakespeare is Wellington's aide-de-camp\"). Alexandre Dumas began as a dramatist, with a series of successes beginning with \"Henri III et sa cour\" (1829) before turning to novels that were mostly historical adventures somewhat in the manner of Scott, most famously \"The Three Musketeers\" and \"The Count of Monte Cristo\", both of 1844. Victor Hugo published as a poet in the 1820s before achieving success on the stage with \"Hernani\"—a historical drama in a quasi-Shakespearian style that had famously riotous performances on its first run in 1830. Like Dumas, Hugo is best known for his novels, and was already writing \"The Hunchback of Notre-Dame\" (1831), one of the best known works, which became a paradigm of the French Romantic movement. The preface to his unperformed play \"Cromwell\" gives an important manifesto of French Romanticism, stating that \"there are no rules, or models\". The career of Prosper Mérimée followed a similar pattern; he is now best known as the originator of the story of \"Carmen\", with his novella published 1845. Alfred de Vigny remains best known as a dramatist, with his play on the life of the English poet \"Chatterton\" (1835) perhaps his best work. George Sand was a central figure of the Parisian literary scene, famous both for her novels and criticism and her affairs with Chopin and several others; she too was inspired by the theatre, and wrote works to be staged at her private estate.\n\nFrench Romantic poets of the 1830s to 1850s include Alfred de Musset, Gérard de Nerval, Alphonse de Lamartine and the flamboyant Théophile Gautier, whose prolific output in various forms continued until his death in 1872.\n\nStendhal is today probably the most highly regarded French novelist of the period, but he stands in a complex relation with Romanticism, and is notable for his penetrating psychological insight into his characters and his realism, qualities rarely prominent in Romantic fiction. As a survivor of the French retreat from Moscow in 1812, fantasies of heroism and adventure had little appeal for him, and like Goya he is often seen as a forerunner of Realism. His most important works are \"Le Rouge et le Noir\" (\"The Red and the Black\", 1830) and \"La Chartreuse de Parme\" (\"The Charterhouse of Parma\", 1839).\n\nRomanticism in Poland is often taken to begin with the publication of Adam Mickiewicz's first poems in 1822, and end with the crushing of the January Uprising of 1863 against the Russians. It was strongly marked by interest in Polish history. Polish Romanticism revived the old \"Sarmatism\" traditions of the \"szlachta\" or Polish nobility. Old traditions and customs were revived and portrayed in a positive light in the Polish messianic movement and in works of great Polish poets such as Adam Mickiewicz (\"Pan Tadeusz\"), Juliusz Słowacki and Zygmunt Krasiński, as well as prose writers such as Henryk Sienkiewicz. This close connection between Polish Romanticism and Polish history became one of the defining qualities of the literature of Polish Romanticism period, differentiating it from that of other countries. They had not suffered the loss of national statehood as was the case with Poland. Influenced by the general spirit and main ideas of European Romanticism, the literature of Polish Romanticism is unique, as many scholars have pointed out, in having developed largely outside of Poland and in its emphatic focus upon the issue of Polish nationalism. The Polish intelligentsia, along with leading members of its government, left Poland in the early 1830s, during what is referred to as the \"Great Emigration\", resettling in France, Germany, Great Britain, Turkey, and the United States.\n\nTheir art featured emotionalism and irrationality, fantasy and imagination, personality cults, folklore and country life, and the propagation of ideals of freedom. In the second period, many of the Polish Romantics worked abroad, often banished from Poland by the occupying powers due to their politically subversive ideas. Their work became increasingly dominated by the ideals of political struggle for freedom and their country's sovereignty. Elements of mysticism became more prominent. There developed the idea of the \"poeta wieszcz\" (the prophet). The \"wieszcz\" (bard) functioned as spiritual leader to the nation fighting for its independence. The most notable poet so recognized was Adam Mickiewicz.\n\nZygmunt Krasinski also wrote to inspire political and religious hope in his countrymen. Unlike his predecessors, who called for victory at whatever price in Poland's struggle against Russia, Krasinski emphasized Poland's spiritual role in its fight for independence, advocating an intellectual rather than a military superiority. His works best exemplify the Messianic movement in Poland: in two early dramas, \"Nie-boska komedyia\" (1835; \"The Undivine Comedy)\" and \"Irydion\" (1836; \"Iridion)\", as well as in the later \"Psalmy przyszłości\" (1845), he asserted that Poland was the Christ of Europe: specifically chosen by God to carry the world's burdens, to suffer, and eventually be resurrected.\n\nEarly Russian Romanticism is associated with the writers Konstantin Batyushkov (\"A Vision on the Shores of the Lethe\", 1809), Vasily Zhukovsky (\"The Bard\", 1811; \"Svetlana\", 1813) and Nikolay Karamzin (\"Poor Liza\", 1792; \"Julia\", 1796; \"Martha the Mayoress\", 1802; \"The Sensitive and the Cold\", 1803). However the principal exponent of Romanticism in Russia is Alexander Pushkin (\"The Prisoner of the Caucasus\", 1820–1821; \"The Robber Brothers\", 1822; \"Ruslan and Ludmila\", 1820; \"Eugene Onegin\", 1825–1832). Pushkin's work influenced many writers in the 19th century and led to his eventual recognition as Russia's greatest poet. Other Russian Romantic poets include Mikhail Lermontov (\"A Hero of Our Time\", 1839), Fyodor Tyutchev (\"Silentium!\", 1830), Yevgeny Baratynsky (\"Eda\", 1826), Anton Delvig, and Wilhelm Küchelbecker.\n\nInfluenced heavily by Lord Byron, Lermontov sought to explore the Romantic emphasis on metaphysical discontent with society and self, while Tyutchev's poems often described scenes of nature or passions of love. Tyutchev commonly operated with such categories as night and day, north and south, dream and reality, cosmos and chaos, and the still world of winter and spring teeming with life. Baratynsky's style was fairly classical in nature, dwelling on the models of the previous century.\n\nRomanticism in Spanish literature developed a well-known literature with a huge variety of poets and playwrights. The most important Spanish poet during this movement was José de Espronceda. After him there were other poets like Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer, Mariano José de Larra and the dramatists Ángel de Saavedra and José Zorrilla, author of \"Don Juan Tenorio\". Before them may be mentioned the pre-romantics José Cadalso and Manuel José Quintana. The plays of Antonio García Gutiérrez were adapted to produce Giuseppe Verdi's operas \"Il trovatore\" and \"Simon Boccanegra\". Spanish Romanticism also influenced regional literatures. For example, in Catalonia and in Galicia there was a national boom of writers in the local languages, like the Catalan Jacint Verdaguer and the Galician Rosalía de Castro, the main figures of the national revivalist movements Renaixença and Rexurdimento, respectively.\n\nThere are scholars who consider Spanish Romanticism to be Proto-Existentialism because it is more anguished than the movement in other European countries. Foster et al., for example, say that the work of Spain's writers such as Espronceda, Larra, and other writers in the 19th century demonstrated a \"metaphysical crisis\". These observers put more weight on the link between the 19th-century Spanish writers with the existentialist movement that emerged immediately after. According to Richard Caldwell, the writers that we now identify with Spain's romanticism were actually precursors to those who galvanized the literary movement that emerged in the 1920s. This notion is the subject of debate for there are authors who stress that Spain's romanticism is one of the earliest in Europe, while some assert that Spain really had no period of literary romanticism. This controversy underscores a certain uniqueness to Spanish romanticism in comparison to its European counterparts.\n\nRomanticism began in Portugal with the publication of the poem \"Camões\" (1825), by Almeida Garrett, who was raised by his uncle D. Alexandre, bishop of Angra, in the precepts of Neoclassicism, which can be observed in his early work. The author himself confesses (in \"Camões\"' preface) that he voluntarily refused to follow the principles of epic poetry enunciated by Aristotle in his \"Poetics\", as he did the same to Horace's \"Ars Poetica\". Almeida Garrett had participated in the 1820 Liberal Revolution, which caused him to exile himself in England in 1823 and then in France, after the Vila-Francada. While living in Great Britain, he had contacts with the Romantic movement and read authors such as Shakespeare, Scott, Ossian, Byron, Hugo, Lamartine and de Staël, at the same time visiting feudal castles and ruins of Gothic churches and abbeys, which would be reflected in his writings. In 1838, he presented \"Um Auto de Gil Vicente\" (\"A Play by Gil Vicente\"), in an attempt to create a new national theatre, free of Greco-Roman and foreign influence. But his masterpiece would be \"Frei Luís de Sousa\" (1843), named by himself as a \"Romantic drama\" and it was acclaimed as an exceptional work, dealing with themes as national independence, faith, justice and love. He was also deeply interested in Portuguese folkloric verse, which resulted in the publication of \"Romanceiro\" (\"Traditional Portuguese Ballads\") (1843), that recollect a great number of ancient popular ballads, known as \"romances\" or \"rimances\", in \"redondilha maior\" verse form, that contained stories of chivalry, life of saints, crusades, courtly love, etc. He wrote the novels \"Viagens na Minha Terra\", \"O Arco de Sant'Ana\" and \"Helena.\"\n\nAlexandre Herculano is, alongside Almeida Garrett, one of the founders of Portuguese Romanticism. He too was forced to exile to Great Britain and France because of his liberal ideals. All of his poetry and prose are (unlike Almeida Garrett's) entirely Romantic, rejecting Greco-Roman myth and history. He sought inspiration in medieval Portuguese poems and chronicles as in the Bible. His output is vast and covers many different genres, such as historical essays, poetry, novels, opuscules and theatre, where he brings back a whole world of Portuguese legends, tradition and history, especially in \"Eurico, o Presbítero\" (\"Eurico, the Priest\") and \"Lendas e Narrativas\" (\"Legends and Narratives\"). His work was influenced by Chateaubriand, Schiller, Klopstock, Walter Scott and the Old Testament Psalms.\n\nAntónio Feliciano de Castilho made the case for Ultra-Romanticism, publishing the poems \"A Noite no Castelo\" (\"Night in the Castle\") and \"Os Ciúmes do Bardo\" (\"The Jealousy of the Bard\"), both in 1836, and the drama \"Camões\". He became an unquestionable master for successive Ultra-Romantic generations, whose influence would not be challenged until the famous Coimbra Question. He also created polemics by translating Goethe's \"Faust\" without knowing German, but using French versions of the play. Other notable figures of Portuguese Romanticism are the famous novelists Camilo Castelo Branco and Júlio Dinis, and Soares de Passos, Bulhão Pato and Pinheiro Chagas.\n\nRomantic style would be revived in the beginning of the 20th century, notably through the works of poets linked to the Portuguese Renaissance (Renascença Portuguesa), such as Teixeira de Pascoais, Jaime Cortesão, Mário Beirão, among others, who can be considered Neo-Romantics. An early Portuguese expression of Romanticism is found already in poets such as Manuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage (especially in his sonnets dated at the end of the 18th century) and Leonor de Almeida Portugal, Marquise of Alorna.\n\nRomanticism in Italian literature was a minor movement, yet still important; it began officially in 1816 when Germaine de Staël wrote an article in the journal \"Biblioteca italiana\" called \"Sulla maniera e l'utilità delle traduzioni\", inviting Italian people to reject Neoclassicism and to study new authors from other countries. Before that date, Ugo Foscolo had already published poems anticipating Romantic themes. The most important Romantic writers were Ludovico di Breme, Pietro Borsieri and Giovanni Berchet. Better known authors such as Alessandro Manzoni and Giacomo Leopardi were influenced by Enlightenment as well as by Romanticism and Classicism.\n\nSpanish-speaking South American Romanticism was influenced heavily by Esteban Echeverría, who wrote in the 1830 and 1840s. His writings were influenced by his hatred for the Argentine dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas, and filled with themes of blood and terror, using the metaphor of a slaughterhouse to portray the violence of Rosas' dictatorship.\n\nBrazilian Romanticism is characterized and divided in three different periods. The first one is basically focused on the creation of a sense of national identity, using the ideal of the heroic Indian. Some examples include José de Alencar, who wrote \"Iracema\" and \"O Guarani\", and Gonçalves Dias, renowned by the poem \"Canção do exílio\" (Song of the Exile). The second period, sometimes called Ultra-Romanticism, is marked by a profound influence of European themes and traditions, involving the melancholy, sadness and despair related to unobtainable love. Goethe and Lord Byron are commonly quoted in these works. Some of the most notable authors of this phase are Álvares de Azevedo, Casimiro de Abreu, Fagundes Varela and Junqueira Freire. The third cycle is marked by social poetry, especially the abolitionist movement, and it includes Castro Alves, Tobias Barreto and Pedro Luís Pereira de Sousa.\nIn the United States, at least by 1818 with William Cullen Bryant's \"To a Waterfowl\", Romantic poetry was being published. American Romantic Gothic literature made an early appearance with Washington Irving's \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" (1820) and \"Rip Van Winkle\" (1819), followed from 1823 onwards by the \"Leatherstocking Tales\" of James Fenimore Cooper, with their emphasis on heroic simplicity and their fervent landscape descriptions of an already-exotic mythicized frontier peopled by \"noble savages\", similar to the philosophical theory of Rousseau, exemplified by Uncas, from \"The Last of the Mohicans\". There are picturesque \"local color\" elements in Washington Irving's essays and especially his travel books. Edgar Allan Poe's tales of the macabre and his balladic poetry were more influential in France than at home, but the romantic American novel developed fully with the atmosphere and melodrama of Nathaniel Hawthorne's \"The Scarlet Letter\" (1850). Later Transcendentalist writers such as Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson still show elements of its influence and imagination, as does the romantic realism of Walt Whitman. The poetry of Emily Dickinson—nearly unread in her own time—and Herman Melville's novel \"Moby-Dick\" can be taken as epitomes of American Romantic literature. By the 1880s, however, psychological and social realism were competing with Romanticism in the novel.\n\nThe European Romantic movement reached America in the early 19th century. American Romanticism was just as multifaceted and individualistic as it was in Europe. Like the Europeans, the American Romantics demonstrated a high level of moral enthusiasm, commitment to individualism and the unfolding of the self, an emphasis on intuitive perception, and the assumption that the natural world was inherently good, while human society was filled with corruption.\n\nRomanticism became popular in American politics, philosophy and art. The movement appealed to the revolutionary spirit of America as well as to those longing to break free of the strict religious traditions of early settlement. The Romantics rejected rationalism and religious intellect. It appealed to those in opposition of Calvinism, which includes the belief that the destiny of each individual is preordained. The Romantic movement gave rise to New England Transcendentalism, which portrayed a less restrictive relationship between God and Universe. The new philosophy presented the individual with a more personal relationship with God. Transcendentalism and Romanticism appealed to Americans in a similar fashion, for both privileged feeling over reason, individual freedom of expression over the restraints of tradition and custom. It often involved a rapturous response to nature. It encouraged the rejection of harsh, rigid Calvinism, and promised a new blossoming of American culture.\n\nAmerican Romanticism embraced the individual and rebelled against the confinement of neoclassicism and religious tradition. The Romantic movement in America created a new literary genre that continues to influence American writers. Novels, short stories, and poems replaced the sermons and manifestos of yore. Romantic literature was personal, intense, and portrayed more emotion than ever seen in neoclassical literature. America's preoccupation with freedom became a great source of motivation for Romantic writers as many were delighted in free expression and emotion without so much fear of ridicule and controversy. They also put more effort into the psychological development of their characters, and the main characters typically displayed extremes of sensitivity and excitement.\n\nThe works of the Romantic Era also differed from preceding works in that they spoke to a wider audience, partly reflecting the greater distribution of books as costs came down during the period.\n\nIn the visual arts, Romanticism first showed itself in landscape painting, where from as early as the 1760s British artists began to turn to wilder landscapes and storms, and Gothic architecture, even if they had to make do with Wales as a setting. Caspar David Friedrich and J. M. W. Turner were born less than a year apart in 1774 and 1775 respectively and were to take German and English landscape painting to their extremes of Romanticism, but both their artistic sensibilities were formed when forms of Romanticism was already strongly present in art. John Constable, born in 1776, stayed closer to the English landscape tradition, but in his largest \"six-footers\" insisted on the heroic status of a patch of the working countryside where he had grown up—challenging the traditional hierarchy of genres, which relegated landscape painting to a low status. Turner also painted very large landscapes, and above all, seascapes. Some of these large paintings had contemporary settings and staffage, but others had small figures that turned the work into history painting in the manner of Claude Lorrain, like Salvator Rosa a late Baroque artist whose landscapes had elements that Romantic painters repeatedly turned to. Friedrich often used single figures, or features like crosses, set alone amidst a huge landscape, \"making them images of the transitoriness of human life and the premonition of death.\"\n\nOther groups of artists expressed feelings that verged on the mystical, many largely abandoning classical drawing and proportions. These included William Blake and Samuel Palmer and the other members of the Ancients in England, and in Germany Philipp Otto Runge. Like Friedrich, none of these artists had significant influence after their deaths for the rest of the 19th century, and were 20th century rediscoveries from obscurity, though Blake was always known as a poet, and Norway's leading painter Johan Christian Dahl was heavily influenced by Friedrich. The Rome-based Nazarene movement of German artists, active from 1810, took a very different path, concentrating on medievalizing history paintings with religious and nationalist themes.\nThe arrival of Romanticism in French art was delayed by the strong hold of Neoclassicism on the academies, but from the Napoleonic period it became increasingly popular, initially in the form of history paintings propagandising for the new regime, of which Girodet's \"Ossian receiving the Ghosts of the French Heroes\", for Napoleon's Château de Malmaison, was one of the earliest. Girodet's old teacher David was puzzled and disappointed by his pupil's direction, saying: \"Either Girodet is mad or I no longer know anything of the art of painting\". A new generation of the French school, developed personal Romantic styles, though still concentrating on history painting with a political message. Théodore Géricault (1791–1824) had his first success with \"The Charging Chasseur\", a heroic military figure derived from Rubens, at the Paris Salon of 1812 in the years of the Empire, but his next major completed work, \"The Raft of the Medusa\" of 1821, remains the greatest achievement of the Romantic history painting, which in its day had a powerful anti-government message.\n\nEugène Delacroix (1798–1863) made his first Salon hits with \"The Barque of Dante\" (1822), \"The Massacre at Chios\" (1824) and \"Death of Sardanapalus\" (1827). The second was a scene from the Greek War of Independence, completed the year Byron died there, and the last was a scene from one of Byron's plays. With Shakespeare, Byron was to provide the subject matter for many other works of Delacroix, who also spent long periods in North Africa, painting colourful scenes of mounted Arab warriors. His \"Liberty Leading the People\" (1830) remains, with the \"Medusa\", one of the best-known works of French Romantic painting. Both reflected current events, and increasingly \"history painting\", literally \"story painting\", a phrase dating back to the Italian Renaissance meaning the painting of subjects with groups of figures, long considered the highest and most difficult form of art, did indeed become the painting of historical scenes, rather than those from religion or mythology.\n\nFrancisco Goya was called \"the last great painter in whose art thought and observation were balanced and combined to form a faultless unity\". But the extent to which he was a Romantic is a complex question. In Spain, there was still a struggle to introduce the values of the Enlightenment, in which Goya saw himself as a participant. The demonic and anti-rational monsters thrown up by his imagination are only superficially similar to those of the Gothic fantasies of northern Europe, and in many ways he remained wedded to the classicism and realism of his training, as well as looking forward to the Realism of the later 19th century. But he, more than any other artist of the period, exemplified the Romantic values of the expression of the artist's feelings and his personal imaginative world. He also shared with many of the Romantic painters a more free handling of paint, emphasized in the new prominence of the brushstroke and impasto, which tended to be repressed in neoclassicism under a self-effacing finish.\nSculpture remained largely impervious to Romanticism, probably partly for technical reasons, as the most prestigious material of the day, marble, does not lend itself to expansive gestures. The leading sculptors in Europe, Antonio Canova and Bertel Thorvaldsen, were both based in Rome and firm Neoclassicists, not at all tempted to allow influence from medieval sculpture, which would have been one possible approach to Romantic sculpture. When it did develop, true Romantic sculpture—with the exception of a few artists such as Rudolf Maison— rather oddly was missing in Germany, and mainly found in France, with François Rude, best known from his group of the 1830s from the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, David d'Angers, and Auguste Préault. Préault's plaster relief entitled \"Slaughter\", which represented the horrors of wars with exacerbated passion, caused so much scandal at the 1834 Salon that Préault was banned from this official annual exhibition for nearly twenty years. In Italy, the most important Romantic sculptor was Lorenzo Bartolini.\n\nIn France, historical painting on idealized medieval and Renaissance themes is known as the \"style Troubadour\", a term with no equivalent for other countries, though the same trends occurred there. Delacroix, Ingres and Richard Parkes Bonington all worked in this style, as did lesser specialists such as Pierre-Henri Révoil (1776–1842) and Fleury-François Richard (1777–1852). Their pictures are often small, and feature intimate private and anecdotal moments, as well as those of high drama. The lives of great artists such as Raphael were commemorated on equal terms with those of rulers, and fictional characters were also depicted. Fleury-Richard's \"Valentine of Milan weeping for the death of her husband\", shown in the Paris Salon of 1802, marked the arrival of the style, which lasted until the mid-century, before being subsumed into the increasingly academic history painting of artists like Paul Delaroche.\nAnother trend was for very large apocalyptic history paintings, often combining extreme natural events, or divine wrath, with human disaster, attempting to outdo \"The Raft of the Medusa\", and now often drawing comparisons with effects from Hollywood. The leading English artist in the style was John Martin, whose tiny figures were dwarfed by enormous earthquakes and storms, and worked his way through the biblical disasters, and those to come in the final days. Other works such as Delacroix's \"Death of Sardanapalus\" included larger figures, and these often drew heavily on earlier artists, especially Poussin and Rubens, with extra emotionalism and special effects.\n\nElsewhere in Europe, leading artists adopted Romantic styles: in Russia there were the portraitists Orest Kiprensky and Vasily Tropinin, with Ivan Aivazovsky specializing in marine painting, and in Norway Hans Gude painted scenes of fjords. In Italy Francesco Hayez (1791–1882) was the leading artist of Romanticism in mid-19th-century Milan. His long, prolific and extremely successful career saw him begin as a Neoclassical painter, pass right through the Romantic period, and emerge at the other end as a sentimental painter of young women. His Romantic period included many historical pieces of \"Troubadour\" tendencies, but on a very large scale, that are heavily influenced by Gian Battista Tiepolo and other late Baroque Italian masters.\n\nLiterary Romanticism had its counterpart in the American visual arts, most especially in the exaltation of an untamed American landscape found in the paintings of the Hudson River School. Painters like Thomas Cole, Albert Bierstadt and Frederic Edwin Church and others often expressed Romantic themes in their paintings. They sometimes depicted ancient ruins of the old world, such as in Fredric Edwin Church's piece \"Sunrise in Syria\". These works reflected the Gothic feelings of death and decay. They also show the Romantic ideal that Nature is powerful and will eventually overcome the transient creations of men. More often, they worked to distinguish themselves from their European counterparts by depicting uniquely American scenes and landscapes. This idea of an American identity in the art world is reflected in W. C. Bryant's poem, \"To Cole, the Painter, Departing for Europe\", where Bryant encourages Cole to remember the powerful scenes that can only be found in America.\n\nSome American paintings (such as Albert Bierstadt's \"The Rocky Mountains, Lander's Peak\") promote the literary idea of the \"noble savage\" by portraying idealized Native Americans living in harmony with the natural world. Thomas Cole's paintings tend towards allegory, explicit in \"The Voyage of Life\" series painted in the early 1840s, showing the stages of life set amidst an awesome and immense nature.\n\nMusical Romanticism is predominantly a German phenomenon—so much so that one respected French reference work defines it entirely in terms of \"The role of music in the aesthetics of German romanticism\". Another French encyclopedia holds that the German temperament generally \"can be described as the deep and diverse action of romanticism on German musicians\", and that there is only one true representative of Romanticism in French music, Hector Berlioz, while in Italy, the sole great name of musical Romanticism is Giuseppe Verdi, \"a sort of [Victor] Hugo of opera, gifted with a real genius for dramatic effect\". Nevertheless, the huge popularity of German Romantic music led, \"whether by imitation or by reaction\", to an often nationalistically inspired vogue amongst Polish, Hungarian, Russian, Czech, and Scandinavian musicians, successful \"perhaps more because of its extra-musical traits than for the actual value of musical works by its masters\".\n\nAlthough the term \"Romanticism\" when applied to music has come to imply the period roughly from 1800 until 1850, or else until around 1900, the contemporary application of \"romantic\" to music did not coincide with this modern interpretation. Indeed, one of the earliest sustained applications of the term to music occurs in 1789, in the \"Mémoires\" of André Grétry. This is of particular interest because it is a French source on a subject mainly dominated by Germans, but also because it explicitly acknowledges its debt to Jean-Jacques Rousseau (himself a composer, amongst other things) and, by so doing, establishes a link to one of the major influences on the Romantic movement generally. In 1810 E.T.A. Hoffmann named Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven as \"the three masters of instrumental compositions\" who \"breathe one and the same romantic spirit\". He justified his view on the basis of these composers' depth of evocative expression and their marked individuality. In Haydn's music, according to Hoffmann, \"a child-like, serene disposition prevails\", while Mozart (in the late E-flat major Symphony, for example) \"leads us into the depths of the spiritual world\", with elements of fear, love, and sorrow, \"a presentiment of the infinite ... in the eternal dance of the spheres\". Beethoven's music, on the other hand, conveys a sense of \"the monstrous and immeasurable\", with the pain of an endless longing that \"will burst our breasts in a fully coherent concord of all the passions.\" This elevation in the valuation of pure emotion resulted in the promotion of music from the subordinate position it had held in relation to the verbal and plastic arts during the Enlightenment. Because music was considered to be free of the constraints of reason, imagery, or any other precise concept, it came to be regarded, first in the writings of Wackenroder and Tieck and later by writers such as Schelling and Wagner, as preeminent among the arts, the one best able to express the secrets of the universe, to evoke the spirit world, infinity, and the absolute.\n\nThis chronologic agreement of musical and literary Romanticism continued as far as the middle of the 19th century, when Richard Wagner denigrated the music of Meyerbeer and Berlioz as \"neoromantic\": \"The Opera, to which we shall now return, has swallowed down the Neoromanticism of Berlioz, too, as a plump, fine-flavoured oyster, whose digestion has conferred on it anew a brisk and well-to-do appearance.\"\n\nIt was only toward the end of the 19th century that the newly emergent discipline of \"Musikwissenschaft\" (musicology)—itself a product of the historicizing proclivity of the age—attempted a more scientific periodization of music history, and a distinction between Viennese Classical and Romantic periods was proposed. The key figure in this trend was Guido Adler, who viewed Beethoven and Franz Schubert as transitional but essentially Classical composers, with Romanticism achieving full maturity only in the post-Beethoven generation of Frédéric Chopin, Robert Schumann, Berlioz, and Franz Liszt. From Adler's viewpoint, found in books like \"Der Stil in der Musik\" (1911), composers of the New German School and various late-19th-century nationalist composers were not Romantics but \"moderns\" or \"realists\" (by analogy with the fields of painting and literature), and this schema remained prevalent through the first decades of the 20th century.\n\nBy the second quarter of the 20th century, an awareness that radical changes in musical syntax had occurred during the early 1900s caused another shift in historical viewpoint, and the change of century came to be seen as marking a decisive break with the musical past. This in turn led historians such as Alfred Einstein to extend the musical \"Romantic Era\" throughout the 19th century and into the first decade of the 20th. It has continued to be referred to as such in some of the standard music references such as \"The Oxford Companion to Music\" and Grout's \"History of Western Music\" but was not unchallenged. For example, the prominent German musicologist Friedrich Blume, the chief editor of the first edition of \"Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart\" (1949–86), accepted the earlier position that Classicism and Romanticism together constitute a single period beginning in the middle of the 18th century, but at the same time held that it continued into the 20th century, including such pre–World War II developments as expressionism and neoclassicism. This is reflected in some notable recent reference works such as the \"New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\" and the new edition of \"Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart\".\n\nIn the contemporary music culture, the romantic musician followed a public career depending on sensitive middle-class audiences rather than on a courtly patron, as had been the case with earlier musicians and composers. Public persona characterized a new generation of virtuosi who made their way as soloists, epitomized in the concert tours of Paganini and Liszt, and the conductor began to emerge as an important figure, on whose skill the interpretation of the increasingly complex music depended.\n\nThe Romantic movement affected most aspects of intellectual life, and Romanticism and science had a powerful connection, especially in the period 1800–40. Many scientists were influenced by versions of the \"Naturphilosophie\" of Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and others, and without abandoning empiricism, sought in their work to uncover what they tended to believe was a unified and organic Nature. The English scientist Sir Humphry Davy, a prominent Romantic thinker, said that understanding nature required \"an attitude of admiration, love and worship, [...] a personal response.\" He believed that knowledge was only attainable by those who truly appreciated and respected nature. Self-understanding was an important aspect of Romanticism. It had less to do with proving that man was capable of understanding nature (through his budding intellect) and therefore controlling it, and more to do with the emotional appeal of connecting himself with nature and understanding it through a harmonious co-existence.\n\nHistory writing was very strongly, and many would say harmfully, influenced by Romanticism. In England Thomas Carlyle was a highly influential essayist who turned historian; he both invented and exemplified the phrase \"hero-worship\", lavishing largely uncritical praise on strong leaders such as Oliver Cromwell, Frederick the Great and Napoleon. Romantic nationalism had a largely negative effect on the writing of history in the 19th century, as each nation tended to produce its own version of history, and the critical attitude, even cynicism, of earlier historians was often replaced by a tendency to create romantic stories with clearly distinguished heroes and villains. Nationalist ideology of the period placed great emphasis on racial coherence, and the antiquity of peoples, and tended to vastly over-emphasize the continuity between past periods and the present, leading to national mysticism. Much historical effort in the 20th century was devoted to combating the romantic historical myths created in the 19th century.\n\nTo insulate theology from reductionism in science, 19th-century post-Enlightenment German theologians moved in a new direction, led by Friedrich Schleiermacher and Albrecht Ritschl. They took the Romantic approach of rooting religion in the inner world of the human spirit, so that it is a person's feeling or sensibility about spiritual matters that comprises religion.\n\nRomantic chess was the style of chess which emphasized quick, tactical maneuvers rather than long-term strategic planning. The Romantic era in chess is generally considered to have begun with Joseph MacDonnell and Pierre LaBourdonnais, the two dominant chess players in the 1830s. The 1840s was dominated by Howard Staunton, and other leading players of the era included Adolf Anderssen, Daniel Harrwitz, Henry Bird, Louis Paulsen, and Paul Morphy. The \"Immortal Game\", played by Adolf Anderssen and Lionel Kieseritzky on 21 June 1851 in London—where Anderssen made bold sacrifices to secure victory, giving up both rooks and a bishop, then his queen, and then checkmating his opponent with his three remaining minor pieces—is considered a supreme example of Romantic chess. The end of the Romantic era in chess is considered to be the 1873 Vienna Tournament where Wilhelm Steinitz popularized positional play and the closed game.\n\nOne of Romanticism's key ideas and most enduring legacies is the assertion of nationalism, which became a central theme of Romantic art and political philosophy. From the earliest parts of the movement, with their focus on development of national languages and folklore, and the importance of local customs and traditions, to the movements that would redraw the map of Europe and lead to calls for self-determination of nationalities, nationalism was one of the key vehicles of Romanticism, its role, expression and meaning. One of the most important functions of medieval references in the 19th century was nationalist. Popular and epic poetry were its workhorses. This is visible in Germany and Ireland, where underlying Germanic or Celtic linguistic substrates dating from before the Romanization-Latinization were sought out.\n\nEarly Romantic nationalism was strongly inspired by Rousseau, and by the ideas of Johann Gottfried von Herder, who in 1784 argued that the geography formed the natural economy of a people, and shaped their customs and society.\n\nThe nature of nationalism changed dramatically, however, after the French Revolution with the rise of Napoleon, and the reactions in other nations. Napoleonic nationalism and republicanism were, at first, inspirational to movements in other nations: self-determination and a consciousness of national unity were held to be two of the reasons why France was able to defeat other countries in battle. But as the French Republic became Napoleon's Empire, Napoleon became not the inspiration for nationalism, but the object of its struggle. In Prussia, the development of spiritual renewal as a means to engage in the struggle against Napoleon was argued by, among others, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, a disciple of Kant. The word \"Volkstum\", or nationality, was coined in German as part of this resistance to the now conquering emperor. Fichte expressed the unity of language and nation in his address \"To the German Nation\" in 1806:\n\nThose who speak the same language are joined to each other by a multitude of invisible bonds by nature herself, long before any human art begins; they understand each other and have the power of continuing to make themselves understood more and more clearly; they belong together and are by nature one and an inseparable whole. ...Only when each people, left to itself, develops and forms itself in accordance with its own peculiar quality, and only when in every people each individual develops himself in accordance with that common quality, as well as in accordance with his own peculiar quality—then, and then only, does the manifestation of divinity appear in its true mirror as it ought to be.\n\nThis view of nationalism inspired the collection of folklore by such people as the Brothers Grimm, the revival of old epics as national, and the construction of new epics as if they were old, as in the \"Kalevala\", compiled from Finnish tales and folklore, or \"Ossian\", where the claimed ancient roots were invented. The view that fairy tales, unless contaminated from outside literary sources, were preserved in the same form over thousands of years, was not exclusive to Romantic Nationalists, but fit in well with their views that such tales expressed the primordial nature of a people. For instance, the Brothers Grimm rejected many tales they collected because of their similarity to tales by Charles Perrault, which they thought proved they were not truly German tales; \"Sleeping Beauty\" survived in their collection because the tale of Brynhildr convinced them that the figure of the sleeping princess was authentically German. Vuk Karadžić contributed to Serbian folk literature, using peasant culture as the foundation. He regarded the oral literature of the peasants as an integral part of Serbian culture, compiling it to use in his collections of folk songs, tales, and proverbs, as well as the first dictionary of vernacular Serbian. Similar projects were undertaken by the Russian Alexander Afanasyev, the Norwegians Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe, and the Englishman Joseph Jacobs.\nRomanticism played an essential role in the national awakening of many Central European peoples lacking their own national states, not least in Poland, which had recently failed to restore its independence when Russia's army crushed the Polish Uprising under Nicholas I. Revival and reinterpretation of ancient myths, customs and traditions by Romantic poets and painters helped to distinguish their indigenous cultures from those of the dominant nations and crystallise the mythography of Romantic nationalism. Patriotism, nationalism, revolution and armed struggle for independence also became popular themes in the arts of this period. Arguably, the most distinguished Romantic poet of this part of Europe was Adam Mickiewicz, who developed an idea that Poland was the Messiah of Nations, predestined to suffer just as Jesus had suffered to save all the people. The Polish self-image as a \"Christ among nations\" or the martyr of Europe can be traced back to its history of Christendom and suffering under invasions. During the periods of foreign occupation, the Catholic Church served as bastion of Poland's national identity and language, and the major promoter of Polish culture. The partitions came to be seen in Poland as a Polish sacrifice for the security for Western civilization. Adam Mickiewicz wrote the patriotic drama Dziady (directed against the Russians) where he depicts Poland as the Christ of Nations. He also wrote \"Verily I say unto you, it is not for you to learn civilization from foreigners, but it is you who are to teach them civilization ... You are among the foreigners like the Apostles among the idolaters\". In \"Books of the Polish nation and Polish pilgrimage\" Mickiewicz detailed his vision of Poland as a Messias and a Christ of Nations, that would save mankind. Dziady is known for various interpretation. The most known ones are the moral aspect of part II, individualist and romantic message of part IV, as well as deeply patriotic, messianistic and Christian vision in part III of poem. Zdzisław Kępiński, however, focuses his interpretation on Slavic pagan and occult elements found in the drama. In his book \"Mickiewicz hermetyczny\" he writes about hermetic, theosophic and alchemical philosophy on the book as well as Masonic symbols.\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Romanticism&action=submit\n"}

He painted theater scenery in his early career and then had several showings in galleries in New York City. Winning Works Progress Administration commissions in the 1930s, he completed murals for the post offices in Jackson, Mississippi and Beaufort, North Carolina. His works are in the permanent collections of the Dallas Museum of Art, the National Museum of American Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.\n\nSimka Faibusovich Simkhovitch was born on May 21, 1885 O.S./June 2, 1885 N.S. into a Jewish family in Novozybkov, Russia, who owned a small department store. During a severe case of measles when he was seven, Simkhovitch sketched the views outside his window and decided to become an artist, over his father's objections. Beginning in 1905, he studied at the Grekov Odessa Art School and upon completion of his studies in 1911 received a recommendation to be admitted to the Imperial Academy of Arts. Though he enrolled to begin classes in architecture, painting, and sculpture at the Imperial Academy, he was dropped from the school roster in December because of the quota on the number of Jewish students and drafted into the army. Simkhovitch served as a private in the until his demobilization in 1912. Re-enrolling in the Imperial Academy, he audited classes.\n\nSimkhovitch exhibited paintings and sculptures in 1918 as part of an exhibition of Jewish artists and in 1919 placed 1st in the competition \"The Great Russian Revolution\" with a painting called \"Russian Revolution\" which was hung in the State Museum of Revolution. In 1922, Simkhovitch exhibited at the International Book Fair in Florence (). In 1924, Simkhovitch came to the United States to make illustrations for Soviet textbooks and decided to immigrate instead. Initially he supported himself by doing commercial art and a few portrait commissions. In 1927, he was hired to paint a screen for a scene in the play \"The Command to Love\" by Fritz Gottwald and Rudolph Lothar which was playing at the Longacre Theatre on Broadway. Art dealers began clamoring for the screen and Simkhovitch began a career as a screen painter for the theater. Catching the attention of the screenwriter, Ernest Pascal, he worked as an illustrator for Pascal, who then introduced him to gallery owner, Marie Sterner. Simkhovitch's works appeared at the Marie Sterner Gallery beginning with a 1927 exhibit and were repeated the following year. Simkhovitch had an exhibit in 1929 at Sterner's on circus paintings. In 1931, he held a showing of works at the Helen Hackett Gallery, in New York City and later that same year he was one of the featured artists of a special exhibit in San Francisco at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor in Lincoln Park. The exhibit was coordinated by Marie Sterner and included four watercolors, including one titled \"Nudes\".\n\nIn 1936, Simkhovitch was selected to compete the mural for the WPA Post office project in Jackson, Mississippi. The mural was hung in the post office and courthouse in 1938 depicted a plantation theme. In the 1970s, it was the source of repeated controversy for its depiction of stereotypical imagery and during various courthouse remodels was covered. The following year, his painting \"Holiday\" won praise at an exhibition in Lincoln, Nebraska. In 1940, Simkhovitch's second WPA post office project was completed when four murals, \"The Cape Lookout Lighthouse and the Orville W. Mail Boat\", \"The Wreck of the Crissie Wright\", \"Sand Ponies\" and \"Canada Geese\" were installed in Beaufort, North Carolina. The works were commissioned in 1938 and did not generate the controversy that the Jackson mural had. The main mural is \"The Wreck of the Crissie Wright\" and depicts a shipwreck which had occurred in Beaufort in 1866. \"The Cape Lookout Lighthouse and the Orville W. Mail Boat\" depicted the lighthouse built in 1859 and the mail boat that was running mail during the time which Simkhovitch was there. The boat ran mail for the area until 1957. \"Sand Ponies\" shows the wild horses common to the North Carolina barrier islands and \"Canada Geese\" showed the importance of hunting and fishing in the area. All four murals were restored in the 1990s by Elisabeth Speight, daughter of two other WPA muralists, Francis Speight and his wife Sarah Jane Blakeslee.\n\nSimkhovitch's work was selected for a \"Life Magazine\" article and in 1940 the artists whose work would appear were highlighted in an exhibit at Morrill Hall on the campus of the University of Nebraska. He also had a one-man show that year in Manhattan. The 4-page \"Life\" feature appeared in the December 29, 1941 edition of the magazine and showed Simkhovich's home and studio in Greenwich, Connecticut as well as photographs of his wife, the model Elsa Forne, and two of their three daughters, Sonya and Naomi. Simkhovitch continued to paint and do illustrations. In 1946, he sold a painting \"Sonya with Fruit\" to Upjohn to use in cough medicine advertising, which was included in an exhibit of the Upjohn Collection. The following year, he did his first gallery showing in Connecticut at the Sterling House in Stratford. In February 1949, Simkhovitch and his wife bought a new home in Milford, Connecticut, but Simkhovitch contracted pneumonia during the move. He died after a brief illness on 25 February 1949 in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nSubsequent to his death, Simkhovitch's papers were donated to the Archives of American Art at the Smithsonian Institution in 1989. His works are part of the permanent collections of the Dallas Museum of Art, the\nNational Museum of American Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art, as well as other collections.\n\n\n"}

He was born in France, the son of James Joyce's son, Giorgio, and Helen Joyce, née Kastor. Stephen attended Harvard University, graduating in 1958. At Harvard, he once roomed with Paul Matisse, grandson of French impressionist painter Henri Matisse, and with Sadruddin Aga Khan. Thereafter, he worked for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on African development. He retired from the OECD in 1991 to focus on managing his grandfather's estate. He and his wife, Solange Raythchine Joyce, live in the Île de Ré in France. They have no children; Stephen is James Joyce's sole living descendant.\n\nStephen Joyce and Seán Sweeney are the joint trustees of the Estate of James Joyce. Stephen Joyce has taken an active role in all legal matters relating to Joyce's works. He has brought numerous lawsuits or threats of legal action against scholars, biographers, and artists attempting to quote from Joyce's literary work or personal correspondence. \n\nIn 2004, Stephen Joyce threatened legal action against the Irish government when the \"Rejoyce Dublin 2004\" festival proposed public reading of excerpts of \"Ulysses\" on Bloomsday. In 1988 he destroyed a collection of letters written by Lucia Joyce, his aunt. In 1989 he forced Brenda Maddox to delete a postscript concerning Lucia from her biography \"Nora: The Real Life of Molly Bloom\". After 1995 he announced no permissions would be granted to quote from his grandfather's work. Libraries holding letters by James Joyce were unable to show them without permission. Versions of his work online were disallowed. Stephen Joyce claimed to be protecting his grandfather's and his family's reputation, but would sometimes grant permission to use material in exchange for fees that were often \"extortionate\".\n\nOn 13 January 2011, on the 70th anniversary of James Joyce's death, all of his works entered the public domain in much of the world, a transition \"talked up in certain quarters as though it were a bookish version of the destruction of the Death Star, with Stephen Joyce cast as a highbrow Darth Vader suddenly no longer in a position to breathe heavily down the necks of rebel Joyceans.\" In the US, however, some of his work remains protected by copyright. Prior to this, in 2007, Stephen Joyce's hold on the estate had already been delimited by a fair use suit brought by Carol Loeb Schloss and the Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society's Fair Use Project.\n\nWhen the Central Bank of Ireland issued a ten euro James Joyce commemorative coin on 10 April 2013, Stephen Joyce described the coin and the circumstances of its issue as \"one of the greatest insults to the Joyce family that has ever been perpetrated in Ireland\". He complained of a lack of consultation over the coin; he objected to an error in a Joycean quotation inscribed on the coin; he was upset by the design of the portrait of the writer on the coin, calling it \"the most unlikely likeness of Joyce ever produced\"; and he described as highly insensitive and offensive the decision to issue the coin on the anniversary of the death of his grandmother, Nora Joyce, who died in 1951.\n\n"}
{"id": "14386742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14386742", "title": "Tabula Rogeriana", "text": "Tabula Rogeriana\n\nThe Nuzhat al-mushtāq fi'khtirāq al-āfāq (, lit. \"the book of pleasant journeys into faraway lands\"), most often known as the Tabula Rogeriana (lit. \"The Book of Roger\" in Latin), is a description of the world and world map created by the Arab geographer, Muhammad al-Idrisi, in 1154. Al-Idrisi worked on the commentaries and illustrations of the map for fifteen years at the court of the Norman King Roger II of Sicily, who commissioned the work around 1138.\n\nThe book, written in Arabic, is divided into seven climate zones (in keeping with the established Ptolemaic system), each of which is sub-divided into ten sections, and contains maps showing the Eurasian continent in its entirety, but only the northern part of the African continent. The map is oriented with the North at the bottom. It remained the most accurate world map for the next three centuries. The text incorporates exhaustive descriptions of the physical, cultural, political and socioeconomic conditions of each region and each of the seventy sections has a corresponding map.\n\nTo produce the work, al-Idrisi interviewed experienced travelers individually and in groups on their knowledge of the world and compiled \"only that part... on which there was complete agreement and seemed credible, excluding what was contradictory.\" Roger II had his map engraved on a silver disc weighing about 300 pounds. It showed, in al-Idrisi's words, \"the seven climatic regions, with their respective countries and districts, coasts and lands, gulfs and seas, watercourses and river mouths.\" \n\nAl-Idrisi settled in Palermo, Sicily, at the tolerant and enlightened court of the Norman king Roger II of Sicily, where he was charged with the production of a book on geography. It was to contain all available data on the location and climate of the world’s main centers of population. King Roger himself enthusiastically interviewed travelers passing through his kingdom, and agents and draftsmen were dispatched to gather material—a research process that took some 15 years. In 1154, just a few weeks before the king died, al-Idrisi’s book was finally complete. \n\nWritten in Arabic and Latin and accompanied by maps, it presented the world as a sphere. It calculated the circumference to be 37,000 kilometres (22,900 mi) — an error of less than 10 percent — and it hinted at the concept of gravity. Following the classical Greek tradition, al-Idrisi had divided the world into seven climate zones and described each in turn, supported by 70 longitudinal section maps which, when put together, made a rectangular map of the known world. This was complemented by a smaller, circular world map in which the south was drawn at the top and Arabia, being the site of Mecca, was depicted centrally. Al-Idrisi’s book came to be known as Kitab Rujar (Roger’s Book) and the circular world map was engraved onto a silver tablet. Sadly, both the book and the silver map appear to have been destroyed during civil unrest shortly afterward, in 1160. Thus our understanding today of al-Idrisi’s conclusions is based on an abbreviated version of a second book that he wrote for Roger’s son, William II. Manuscripts of this so-called “Little Idrisi” are held today in a handful of European libraries.\"\n\nOn the work of al-Idrisi, S. P. Scott commented: \n\nTen manuscript copies of the \"Book of Roger\" currently survive, five of which have complete text and eight of which have maps. Two are in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, including the oldest, dated to about 1325. (MS Arabe 2221). Another copy, made in Cairo in 1553, is in the Bodleian Library in Oxford (Mss. Pococke 375). It was acquired in 1692. The most complete manuscript, which includes the world map and all seventy sectional maps, is kept in Istanbul.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46304575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46304575", "title": "The Death-Ray", "text": "The Death-Ray\n\nThe Death Ray is a graphic novel by American cartoonist Daniel Clowes that first appeared in issue 23 of Clowes's comic book \"Eightball\" in 2004, and then as a standalone book in 2011.\n\nThe story, which flashes back and forth from the 1970s and present day, revolves around a man Andy who reflects upon his childhood and the events that led to him living a life alone, with no friends or loved ones. Raised by his grandfather after his parents both died (mother from a blood clot in the brain, his father from cancer) when he was young., Andy is bullied by his classmates and dominated by his obnoxious best friend Louie. When he turns seventeen, the Andy (who is weak and skinny) begins smoking and suddenly experiences short bursts of what appear, to him, as being super strength. Shortly afterwords, Andy's grandfather provides him with a box containing belongings of his father that he had kept secret. These include a journal, that explain that as a kid, Andy was exposed to experimental hormones by his father to ensure that his son would not be frail and weak like he was. This causes Louie to believe that smoking causes Andy to become super strong. Louis then convinces him to become an amateur super-hero with him as his sidekick.\n\nSeeking to find out more about his father, Andy requests that his aunt send him anything that she might have that belonged to his father. His aunt sends him a box that contains a \"death ray\" that disintegrates anyone shot by its ray.\n\nMuch of the story deals with Andy's relationship with his grandfather, who is suffering from the onset of dementia and his black nurse/aid Delia, who Andy secretly has a crush on. Louie becomes more and more obsessed with having Andy use the death ray to kill local bullies and troublemakers, such as the abusive father of a girl Louie has a crush on. As Louie and Andy drift apart, Andy befriends Sonny, the ex-boyfriend of Louie's sister who attempts to help Andy cope with his grandfather's mental decline.\n\nUltimately, Louie attempts to crush Andy's head in with a rock in order to permanently steal the death ray from him. Andy is forced to kill Andy, disintegrating him as a result. Afterwords, Andy's grandfather is placed into a group home, Andy is given custody of Louie's dog by his family (who do not suspect Andy of foul play), and Andy and the dog are forced to leave school in order to move in with his aunt.\n\nThe story then skips to the early 2000s; Andy is now in his late 40s and is bitter and cynical about life; twice divorced, he has since adopted Louie's nihilistic view on life and the death ray and repeatedly moves from town to town, to avoid suspicion for the murders he commits with the gun. Having used the death ray to murder the men that both of his wives cheated on him with, and having failed at a relationship with his high school crush Dusty, Andy sold the death ray to a pawn shop and moved on with his life. However, after his neighbor's pit bull murdered Louis's dog and then laughs about it, Andy seeks to retrieve the gun and murder his neighbor. Andy convinces Sonny to help him track down the death ray (which Sonny believes is just a toy gun) and along the way, Sonny visits Dusty for Andy and relays an apology to him for unstated incident that ended their budding relationship.\n\nAndy murders his neighbor with the death ray, off-panel and ultimately moves back to the town where he grew up. Once he arrives back to the town, Andy meets the main bully who terrorized him growing up and who, in their last meeting, told Andy that he hoped his grandfather would die from his dementia. Andy resists the urge to murder the now grown up bully, but comments that the bully's now mature and less jerkish behavior was a lie.\n\nThe story ends with a three part epilogue:\n\nThe final set of panels has Andy and his dog watching fireworks in the distance, while repeating a mantra from earlier in the book (during a fantasy sequence where Andy imagines life as a super-hero, with Louie as his sidekick) saying that he will always be available to help a stranger out if they are in trouble.\n\nIn 2012, \"The Death Ray\" won a Harvey Award for Best Graphic Album of Previously Published Work.\n\n"}
