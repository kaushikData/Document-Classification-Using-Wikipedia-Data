He has tried to preserve those buildings in his paintings which are replaced by new style buildings or they are crumbling. These are the buildings of old Lahore; not all are historical, but common homes of common people are the centre of his attention. Natural lively colours bring the buildings to life.\n\nAlthough buildings are the main theme of his paintings and people are just there to make a normal life but the characters he used in his paintings are the quintessential of daily life in Lahore or Punjab.

Attributed to a calligrapher in the Ottoman Empire, the work depicts a galleon of the Ottoman navy. The ship is inscribed with the names of the Seven Sleepers, a group of men who were protected by the Abrahamic God, likely to confer a blessing of protection on the ship. It is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nCalligraphy has had a long and storied history in the Islamic World. While the art form was most commonly reserved for writing or inscribing, some individual works of art were entirely made using calligraphy. Known as \"calligrams\", these images depicted a number of subjects. One such subject was ships, with calligrams of ships being especially popular in the Ottoman Empire. Some practitioners of Sufism attached a degree of mystical importance to these works of art, which were displayed inside of ritual spaces. A similar art-form—Pictorial Writing—was also prevalent in Persia.\n\nThe Met's galleon is done in ink-and-gold on paper. The prominently displayed ship depicted by the calligram is a galleon, a large warship famously used by the Spanish and Portuguese empires during the Age of sail. Due to the Ottoman navy frequently encountering the large Spanish ships in the Mediterranean, the empire's navy built a number of their own galleons to counter the Spanish threat. Thus, the Met's calligram was likely created in honor of the commissioning of new galleons into the Ottoman navy. An example of a similar calligram, depicting a 17th-century oared ship, is in the collection of the Topkapı Palace Museum in Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nThe calligram's creator inscribed characters representing the story of the Seven Sleepers (the Ashab al-Kahf in Arabic), a group of seven men who were given refuge in a cave by God, onto the galleon; it has been posited that such an inscription on the work was intended to protect the ship from harm, just as God protected the seven sleepers. In addition, the Ottoman navy was dedicated to the Seven Sleepers, all of whom's names can be seen on the galleon's hull and deck.\n"}
{"id": "2494871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2494871", "title": "Chicken Little", "text": "Chicken Little\n\nChicken Little, also known as Henny Penny and sometimes as Chicken Licken, is a European folk tale with a moral in the form of a cumulative tale about a chicken who believes the world is coming to an end. The phrase featured prominently in the story, and has passed into the English language as a common idiom indicating a hysterical or mistaken belief that disaster is imminent. Versions of the story go back more than 25 centuries; it continues to be referred to in a variety of media.\n\nThe story is listed as Aarne-Thompson-Uther type 20C, which includes international examples of folktales that make light of paranoia and mass hysteria. \nThere are several Western versions of the story, of which the best-known concerns a chick that believes the sky is falling when an acorn falls on its head. The chick decides to tell the King and on its journey meets other animals (mostly other fowl) which join it in the quest. After this point, there are many endings. In the most familiar, a fox invites them to its lair and then eats them all. Alternatively, the last one, usually Cocky Lockey, survives long enough to warn the chick, who escapes. In others all are rescued and finally speak to the King.\n\nIn most retellings, the animals have rhyming names, commonly Chicken Licken or Chicken Little, Henny Penny or Hen-Len, Cocky Locky, Ducky Lucky or Ducky Daddles, Drakey Lakey, Goosey Loosey or Goosey Poosey, Gander Lander, Turkey Lurkey and Foxy Loxy or Foxy Woxy.\n\nThe moral to be drawn changes, depending on the version. Where there is a \"happy ending\", the moral is not to be a \"Chicken\" but to have courage. In other versions where the birds are eaten by the fox, the fable is interpreted as a warning not to believe everything one is told.\n\nIn the United States, the most common name for the story is \"Chicken Little\", as attested by illustrated books for children dating from the early 19th century. In Britain and its other former colonies, it is best known as \"Henny Penny\" and \"Chicken Licken\", titles by which it also went in the United States.\n\nThe story was part of the oral folk tradition and only began to appear in print after the Brothers Grimm had set a European example with their collection of German tales in the early years of the 19th century. One of the earliest to collect tales from Scandinavian sources was Just Mathias Thiele, who in 1823 published an early version of the Henny Penny story in the Danish language. The names of the characters there are Kylling Kluk, Høne Pøne, Hane Pane, And Svand, Gaase Paase, and Ræv Skræv. In Thiele's untitled account, a nut falls on Kylling Kluk's back and knocks him over. He then goes to each of the other characters, proclaiming that \"I think all the world is falling\" and setting them all running. The fox Ræv Skræv joins in the flight and, when they reach the wood, counts them over from behind and eats them one by one. Eventually the tale was translated into English by Benjamin Thorpe after several other versions had appeared.\n\nOnce the story began to appear in the English language, the titles by which they went varied considerably and have continued to do so. John Greene Chandler (1815-1879), an illustrator and wood engraver from Petersham, Massachusetts, published an illustrated children's book titled \"The Remarkable Story of Chicken Little\" in 1840. In this American version of the story, the characters' names are Chicken Little, Hen-Pen, Duck-Luck, Goose-Loose, and Fox-Lox; Chicken Little is frightened by a leaf falling on her tail.\nA Scots version of the tale is found in Robert Chambers's \"Popular Rhymes, Fireside Stories, and Amusements of Scotland\" of 1842. It appeared among the \"Fireside Nursery Stories\" and was titled \"The hen and her fellow travellers\". The characters included Henny Penny, Cocky Locky, Ducky Daddles, Goosie Poosie, and an unnamed \"tod\" (fox). Henny Penny became convinced that \"the lifts were faun\" (the heavens were falling) when a pea fell on her head.\n\nIn 1849, a \"very different\" English version was published under the title \"The Story of Chicken-Licken\" by Joseph Orchard Halliwell. In this Chicken-licken was startled when \"an acorn fell on her bald pate\" and encounters the characters Hen-len, Cock-lock, Duck-luck, Drake-lake, Goose-loose, Gander-lander, Turkey-lurkey and Fox-lox.\n\nIt was followed in 1850 by \"The wonderful story of Henny Penny\" in Joseph Cundall's compilation, \"The Treasury of pleasure books for young children\". Each story there is presented as if it were a separate book, and in this case had two illustrations by Harrison Weir. In reality the story is a repetition of the Chambers narration in standard English, except that the dialect phrase \"so she gaed, and she gaed, and she gaed\" is retained and the cause of panic is mistranslated as \"the clouds are falling\".\n\nBenjamin Thorpe's translation of Thiele's Danish story was published in 1853 and given the title \"The Little Chicken Kluk and his companions\" Thorpe describes the tale there as \"a pendant to the Scottish story…printed in Chambers\" (see above) and gives the characters approximately the same names as in Chambers.\n\nComparing the different versions, we find that in the Scots and English stories the animals want \"to tell the king\" that the skies are falling; while in the American story, as in the Danish, they are not given any specific motivation. In all versions they are eaten by the fox, although in different circumstances.\n\nThe name \"Chicken Little\" — and the fable's central phrase, \"The sky is falling!\" — have been applied to people accused of being unreasonably afraid, or those trying to incite an unreasonable fear in those around them.\n\nThe first use of the name \"Chicken Little\" to \"one who warns of or predicts calamity, especially without justification\" recorded by the Merriam-Webster Dictionary is in 1895, but idiomatic use of the name significantly predates that attestation. In fact, this usage is recorded in the United States very soon after the publication of Chandler's illustrated children's book in 1840. Already, in 1842, a journal article about the Government of Haiti referred to \"Chicken Little\" in an offhand manner. An \"oration\" delivered to the city of Boston on July 4, 1844, contains the passage: \n\nFear mongering — whether justified or not — can sometimes elicit a societal response called \"Chicken Little syndrome\", described as \"inferring catastrophic conclusions possibly resulting in paralysis\". It has also been defined as \"a sense of despair or passivity which blocks the audience from actions\". The term began appearing in the 1950s and the phenomenon has been noted in many different societal contexts.\n\nWalt Disney Pictures has made two animated versions of the story. The first was \"Chicken Little\", a 1943 animated short released during World War II as one of a series produced at the request of the U.S. government for the purpose of discrediting Nazism. It tells a variant of the parable in which Foxy Loxy takes the advice of a book on psychology (on the original 1943 cut, it is \"Mein Kampf\") by striking the least intelligent first. Dim-witted Chicken Little is convinced by him that the sky is falling and whips the farmyard into mass hysteria, which the unscrupulous fox manipulates for his own benefit. The dark comedy is used as an allegory for the idea that fear-mongering weakens the war effort and costs lives. It is also one of the versions of the story in which Chicken Little appears as a character distinct from Henny Penny.\n\nThe second Disney film was the very loosely adapted \"Chicken Little\", released in 2005 as a 3D computer-animated feature. It is an updated science fiction sequel to the original fable in which Chicken Little is partly justified in his fears. In this version, Foxy Loxy is changed from a male to a female, and from the main antagonist to a local bully. Another film adaptation was the animated TV episode \"Henny Penny\" (1999), which was part of the series \"\". In this modern update, the story is given a satirical and political interpretation. \n\nThere have also been a number of musical settings. American composer Vincent Persichetti used the fable as the plot of his only opera \"The Sibyl: A Parable of Chicken Little\" (Parable XX), op. 135 (1976), which premiered in 1985. On the sitcom \"The Golden Girls\", there was a 1991 episode in which the characters perform a short musical based on the fable (here titled \"Henny Penny\") at a school recital. In 1998, there was Joy Chaitin and Sarah Stevens-Estabrook's equally light-hearted musical version of the fable, \"Henny Penny\". Designed for between six and a hundred junior actors, it has additional characters as optional extras: Funky Monkey, Sheepy Weepy, Mama Llama, Pandy Handy and Giraffy Laughy (plus an aggressive oak-tree).\n\nIn Singapore, a more involved musical was performed in 2005. This was Brian Seward's \" The Acorn - the true story of Chicken Licken\". It is a tale of mixed motivations as certain creatures (including some among the 'good guys') take advantage of the panic caused by Chicken Licken. In 2007 American singer and composer Gary Bachlund set the text of Margaret Free's reading version of \"Chicken Little\" (\"The Primer\", 1910) for high voice and piano. In his note to the score Bachlund makes it clear that he intends a reference to alarmism and its tragic consequences.\n\nThere are many novels, films, CDs and songs titled \"The Sky is Falling\", but the majority refer to the idiomatic use of the phrase rather than to the fable from which it derives. The following are some lyrics which genuinely refer or allude to the story:\n\n\nA very early example containing the basic motif and many of the elements of the tale is some 25 centuries old and appears in the Buddhist scriptures as the \"Daddabha Jataka\" (J 322). In it, the Buddha, on hearing about some particular religious practices, comments that there is no special merit in them, but rather that they are \"like the noise the hare heard.\" He then tells the story of a hare disturbed by a falling fruit who believes that the earth is coming to an end. The hare starts a stampede among the other animals until a lion halts them, investigates the cause of the panic and restores calm. The fable teaches the necessity for deductive reasoning and subsequent investigation.\n\nThe Tibetan version of the Jataka tale has been told in rhyme by Australian author Ursula Dubosarsky in her book \"The Terrible Plop\" (2009), which has since been dramatised, using the original title \"Plop!\". In this, the animal stampede is halted by a bear, rather than a lion. The ending has been changed from the Tibetan original as well.\n\nThere also exists a Br'er Rabbit story that is closer to the Eastern versions. In this story, Br'er Rabbit initiates the panic but does not take part in the mass flight, although Br'er Fox does. In this case it is Br'er Terrapin that leads the animals back to question Br'er Rabbit.\n\n"}

In October 1915, George Eastman provided the funds to build a free dispensary in Rochester, New York that provided oral health benefits to the entire community. This dispensary would serve as the central location for dental services in the Rochester community, supplementing many other smaller offsite locations that had been constructed by other area philanthropists such as Henry Lomb and William Bausch. On May 9, 1917 the dispensary was dedicated and on October 15, 1917 the dispensary officially opened to the public. 1917 also saw the graduation of the first class of the Dental Hygiene School. Over the next few years the dispensary continued to grow, prompting George Eastman to make an endowment of 1,000 additional Kodak stock shares in 1919. This endowment provided necessary funds for the dispensary to aid in the treatment of nose and throat disorders, as well as provide orthodontics services. This endowment also provided the necessary means for the dispensary to open a tonsil-adenoid clinic. Mr. Eastman continued to be a major benefactor of the dispensary even into his death in 1932, leaving a bequest of an additional $1 million. In 1941 the dispensary officially gained its name as the Eastman Dental Dispensary. By 1978, Eastman Dental, as the organization came to be known, moved to a new larger building, the Eastman Dental Center at the University of Rochester Medical Center campus. Following the move, the Eastman Dental Dispensary building sat vacant for close to four decades, and fell into a state of disrepair. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.\n\nIn 2013, Home Leasing LLC, a for profit developer of affordable housing based in Rochester, NY, announced plans to redevelop the Eastman Dental Dispensary into 57 rental apartments.

Eaton Co department store in 1919. The group performed annual concerts in Massey Hall, assembling an orchestra mainly of players from the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. Notable performers to have appeared with the choir included harpist Carlos Salzedo and singer Paul Althouse. Herbert M. Fletcher was the group's first conductor, serving in that role until 1925 when he was succeeded by T.J.

Eventually the choir was completely disbanded during the mid-1930s. The first operetta staged by the society was Gilbert and Sullivan's \"Iolanthe\" at the Eaton Auditorium on 2 March 1932. The group continued to mount operettas at the Eaton Auditorium every Spring through 1965. The group also toured frequently with their productions to other cities in southern Ontario and performed at Canadian army bases during World War II. In its early years, the Savoy operas of Gilbert and Sullivan were the chief part of the society's repertoire, including \"Iolanthe\" (1932, 1938, 1950), \"The Gondoliers\" (1933, 1939, 1948, 1954), \"The Mikado\" (1934, 1940, 1949), \"The Yeoman of the Guard\" (1935, 1941, 1952), and \"The Pirates of Penzance\" (1936, 1942, 1953).

Her own father was an officer in the Imperial Iranian Armed Forces and a graduate of the prestigious French Military Academy at St. Cyr.\n\nFarah wrote in her memoir that she had a close bond with her father, and his unexpected death in 1948 deeply affected her. The young family was in a difficult financial state. In these reduced circumstances, they were forced to move from their large family villa in northern Tehran into a shared apartment with one of Farideh Ghotbi's brothers.\n\nThe young Farah Diba began her education at Tehran's Italian School, then moved to the French Jeanne d'Arc School until the age of sixteen and later to the Lycée Razi. She was an accomplished athlete in her youth and became captain of her school's basketball team. Upon finishing her studies at the Lycée Razi, she pursued an interest in architecture at the École Spéciale d'Architecture in Paris, where she was a student of Albert Besson.\n\nMany Iranian students who were studying abroad at this time were dependent on State sponsorship. Therefore, when the Shah, as head of state, made official visits to foreign countries, he frequently met with a selection of local Iranian students. It was during such a meeting in 1959 at the Iranian Embassy in Paris that Farah Diba was first presented to Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.\n\nAfter returning to Tehran in the summer of 1959, the Shah and Farah Diba began a carefully choreographed courtship, orchestrated in part by the Shah's daughter Princess Shahnaz. The couple announced their engagement on 23 November 1959.\n\nFarah Diba married Shah Mohammed Reza on 20 December 1959, aged 21. The young Queen of Iran (as she was styled at the time) was the object of much curiosity and her wedding received worldwide press attention. Her gown was designed by Yves Saint Laurent, then a designer at the house of Dior, and she wore the newly commissioned Noor-ol-Ain Diamond tiara.\n\nAfter the pomp and celebrations associated with the imperial wedding, the success of this union became contingent upon the queen's ability to produce a male heir. Although he had been married twice before, the Shah's previous marriages had given him only a daughter who, under agnatic primogeniture, could not inherit the throne. The pressure for the young queen was acute. The shah himself was deeply anxious to have a male heir as were the members of his government. Furthermore, it was known that the dissolution of the Shah's previous marriage to Queen Soraya had been due to her infertility.\n\nThe couple had four children:\n\n\nThe exact role the new Queen would play, if any, in public or government affairs, was uncertain with her main role being simply to give the Shah a male heir. Within the Imperial Household, her public function was secondary to the far more pressing matter of assuring the succession. However, after the birth of the Crown Prince, the new Queen was free to devote more of her time to other activities and official pursuits. Mohammad Reza was always very attracted to tall women and Farah was taller than her husband, which led him to wear elevator shoes to disguise this fact. Usually when the Imperial couple were photographed, one or both would be sitting in a chair or alternatively the Shah and his Queen were photographed on a staircase with Mohammad Reza standing on the upper stairs.\n\nLike many other Royal consorts, the young Queen initially limited herself to a ceremonial role. In 1961 during a visit to France, the Francophile Farah befriended the French culture minister André Malraux, leading her to arrange the exchange of cultural artifacts between French and Iranian art galleries and museums, a lively trade that continued until the Islamic revolution of 1979. Farah and Mohammad Reza usually spoke French rather than Farsi to their children. She spent much of her time attending the openings of various education and health-care institutions without venturing too deeply into controversial issues. However, as time progressed, this position changed. The Queen became much more actively involved in government affairs where it concerned issues and causes that interested her. She used her proximity and influence with her husband, the Shah, to secure funding and focus attention on causes, particularly in the areas of women's rights and cultural development. Farah's concerns were the \"realms of education, health, culture and social matters\" with politics being excluded from her purview. However, Mohammad Reza's politically powerful twin sister Princess Ashraf came to see Farah as a rival. It was the rivalry with Princess Ashraf that led Farah to press her husband into reducing her influence at the Court.\nOne of the Empress Farah's main initiatives was founding Pahlavi University, which was meant to improve the education of Iranian women, and was the first American style university in Iran; before then, Iranian universities had always been modeled on the French style. The Empress wrote in 1978 that her duties were:\nI could not write in detail of all the organizations over which I preside and in which I take a very active part, in the realms of education, health, culture and social matters. It would need a further book. A simple list would perhaps give some idea: the Organization for Family Well Being-nurseries for the children of working mothers, teaching women and girls to read, professional training, family planning; the Organization for Blood Transfusion; the Organization for the Fight Against Cancer; the Organization for Help to the Needy, the Health Organization ... the Children's Centre; the Centre for the Intellectual Development of Children ... the Imperial Institute of Philosophy; the Foundation for Iranian Culture; the Festival of Shiraz, the Tehran Cinema Festival; the Iranian Folklore Organization; the Asiatic Institute; the Civilisations Discussion Centre; the Pahlavi University; the Academy of Sciences.\n\nFarah worked long hours at her charitable activities, from about 9 am to 9 pm every weekday. Eventually, the Queen came to preside over a staff of 40 who handled various requests for assistance on a range of issues. She became one of the most highly visible figures in the Imperial Government and the patron of 24 educational, health and cultural organizations. Her humanitarian role earned her immense popularity for a time, particularly in the early 1970s. During this period, she travelled a great deal within Iran, visiting some of the more remote parts of the country and meeting with the local citizens.\nHer significance was exemplified by her part in the 1967 Coronation Ceremonies, where she was crowned as the first \"shahbanu\" (empress) of modern Iran. It was again confirmed when the Shah named her as the official regent should he die or be incapacitated before the Crown Prince's 21st birthday. The naming of a woman as regent was highly unusual for a Middle Eastern or Muslim monarchy. The great wealth generated by Iran's oil encouraged a sense of Iranian nationalism at the Imperial Court. The Empress Farah recalled of her days as a university student in 1950s France about being asked where she was from:\n\nWhen I told them Iran ... the Europeans would recoil in horror as if Iranians were barbarians and loathsome. But after Iran became wealthy under the Shah in the 1970s, Iranians were courted everywhere. Yes, Your Majesty. Of course, Your Majesty. If you please, Your Majesty. Fawning all over us. Greedy sycophants. Then they loved Iranians.\n\nFrom the beginning of her reign, the Empress took an active interest in promoting culture and the arts in Iran. Through her patronage, numerous organizations were created and fostered to further her ambition of bringing historical and contemporary Iranian Art to prominence both inside Iran and in the Western world.\n\nIn addition to her own efforts, the Empress sought to achieve this goal with the assistance of various foundations and advisers. Her ministry encouraged many forms of artistic expression, including traditional Iranian arts (such as weaving, singing, and poetry recital) as well as Western theatre. Her most recognized endeavour supporting the performing arts was her patronage of the Shiraz Arts Festival. This occasionally controversial event was held annually from 1967 until 1977 and featured live performances by both Iranian and Western artists.\n\nThe majority of her time, however, went into the creation of museums and the building of their collections.\n\nAs a former architecture student, the Empress's appreciation of it is demonstrated in the Royal Palace of Niavaran, designed by Mohsen Foroughi, and completed in 1968: it mixes traditional Iranian architecture with 1960's contemporary design. Nearby is the personal library of the Empress, consisting of 22,000 books, comprising principally works on Western and Eastern art, philosophy and religion; the interior was designed by Aziz Farmanfarmayan.\n\nHistorically a culturally rich country, the Iran of the 1960s had little to show for it. Many of the great artistic treasures produced during its 2,500-year history had found their way into the hands of foreign museums and private collections. It became one of the Empress's principal goals to procure for Iran an appropriate collection of its own historic artifacts. To that end, she secured from her husband's government permission and funds to \"buy back\" a wide selection of Iranian artifacts from foreign and domestic collections. This was achieved with the help of the brothers Houshang and Mehdi Mahboubian, the most prominent Iranian antiquities dealers of the era, who advised the Empress from 1972 to 1978. With these artifacts she founded several national museums (many of which still survive to this day) and began an Iranian version of the National Trust.\n\nMuseums and cultural centres created under her guidance include the Negarestan Cultural Center, the Reza Abbasi Museum, the Khorramabad Museum with its valuable collection of Lorestān bronzes, the National Carpet Gallery and the Glassware and Ceramic Museum of Iran.\n\nAside from building a collection of historic Iranian artifacts, the Empress also expressed interest in acquiring contemporary Western and Iranian art. To this end, she put her significant patronage behind the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art. The fruits of her work in founding and expanding that institution are perhaps the Empress' most enduring cultural legacy to the people of Iran.\n\nUsing funds allocated from the Government, the Empress took advantage of a somewhat depressed art market of the 1970s to purchase several important works of Western art. Under her guidance, the Museum acquired nearly 150 works by such artists as Pablo Picasso, Claude Monet, George Grosz, Andy Warhol, Jackson Pollock, and Roy Lichtenstein. Today, the collection of the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art is widely considered to be one of the most significant outside Europe and the United States. According to Parviz Tanavoli, a modern Iranian sculptor and a former Cultural Adviser to the Empress, that the impressive collection was amassed for \"tens, not hundreds, of millions of dollars\". Today, the value of these holdings are conservatively estimated to be near US$2.8 billion.\n\nThe collection created a conundrum for the anti-western Islamic Republic which took power after the fall of the Pahlavi Dynasty in 1979. Although politically the fundamentalist government rejected Western influence in Iran, the Western art collection amassed by the Empress was retained, most likely due to its enormous value. It was, nevertheless, not publicly displayed and spent nearly two decades in storage in the vaults of the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art. This caused much speculation as to the fate of the artwork which was only put to rest after a large portion of the collection was briefly seen again in an exhibition that took place in Tehran during September 2005.\n\nIn Iran by early 1978, a number of factors contributed to the internal dissatisfaction with the Imperial Government becoming more pronounced.\n\nDiscontent within the country continued to escalate and later in the year led to demonstrations against the monarchy. Pahlavi wrote in her memoirs that during this time \"there was an increasingly palpable sense of unease\". Under these circumstances most of the Shahbanu's official activities were cancelled due to concerns for her safety.\n\nAs the year came to a close, the political situation deteriorated further. Riots and unrest grew more frequent, culminating in January 1979. The government enacted martial law in most major Iranian cities and the country was on the verge of an open revolution.\n\nIt was at this time, in response to the violent protests, that Mohammad Reza and Farah decided to leave the country. They both departed Iran via aircraft on 16 January 1979.\n\nThe question of where the Shah and Shahbanu would go after leaving Iran was the subject of some debate, even between the monarch and his advisers. During his reign, Mohammad Reza had maintained close relations with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Farah had developed a close friendship with the President's wife, Jehan Sadat. The Egyptian President extended an invitation to the Imperial Couple for asylum in Egypt which they accepted.\nDue to the political situation unfolding in Iran, many governments, including those which had been on friendly terms with the Iranian Monarchy prior to the revolution, saw the Shah's presence within their borders as a liability. The Revolutionary Government in Iran had ordered the arrest (and later death) of both the Shah and the Shahbanu. The new Iranian Government would go on to vehemently demand their extradition a number of times but the extent to which it would act in pressuring foreign powers for the deposed monarch's return (and presumably that of the Empress) was at that time unknown.\n\nThe Imperial couple were aware of the potential danger which their presence carried to their hosts. In response, they left Egypt, beginning a fourteen-month long search for permanent asylum and a journey which took them through many countries. After Egypt, they traveled to Morocco, where they were briefly the guests of King Hassan II.\n\nAfter leaving Morocco, the Shah and Empress were granted temporary refuge in the Bahamas. After their Bahamian visas expired and were not renewed, they made an appeal to Mexico, which was granted, and rented a villa in Cuernavaca near Mexico City.\n\nAfter leaving Egypt the Shah's health began a rapid decline due to a long-term battle with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The seriousness of that illness brought the now exiled Imperial couple briefly to the United States in search of medical treatment. The couple's presence in the United States further inflamed the already tense relations between Washington and the revolutionaries in Tehran. The Shah's stay in the US, although for medical purposes, became the tipping point for renewed hostilities between the two nations. These events ultimately led to the attack and takeover of the American Embassy in Tehran in what became known as the Iran hostage crisis.\n\nUnder these difficult circumstances, the Shah and Empress were not given permission to remain in the United States. Shortly after receiving basic medical attention, the couple again departed for Latin America, although this time the destination was Contadora Island in Panama.\n\nBy now, both the Shah and Empress viewed the Carter Administration with some antipathy in response to a lack of support and were initially pleased to leave. That attitude, however soured as speculation arose that the Panamanian Government was seeking to arrest the Shah in preparation for extradition to Iran. Under these conditions the Shah and Empress again made an appeal to President Anwar Sadat to return to Egypt (for her part Empress Farah writes that this plea was made through a conversation between herself and Jehan Sadat). Their request was granted and they returned to Egypt in March 1980, where they remained until the Shah's death four months later on 27 July 1980.\n\nAfter the Shah's death, the exiled Shahbanu remained in Egypt for nearly two years. President Anwar Sadat gave her and her family use of Koubbeh Palace in Cairo. A few months after President Sadat's assassination in October 1981, the Shahbanu and her family left Egypt. President Ronald Reagan informed her that she was welcome in the United States.\n\nShe first settled in Williamstown, Massachusetts, but later bought a home in Greenwich, Connecticut. After the death of her daughter Princess Leila in 2001, she purchased a smaller home in Potomac, Maryland, near Washington, D.C., to be closer to her son and grandchildren. Farah now divides her time between Washington, D.C., and Paris. She also makes an annual July pilgrimage to the late Shah's mausoleum at Cairo's al-Rifa'i Mosque.\n\nFarah supports charities, including the Annual Alzheimer Gala IFRAD (International Fund Raising for Alzheimer Disease) held in Paris.\n\nFarah Pahlavi continues to appear at certain international royal events, such as the 2004 wedding of Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark, the 2010 wedding of Prince Nikolaos of Greece and Denmark, the 2011 wedding of Albert II, Prince of Monaco and the 2016 wedding of Crown Prince Leka II of Albania.\n\nFarah Pahlavi currently has three grandchildren (granddaughters) through her son Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran and his wife Yasmine.\n\n\nFarah Pahlavi also has one granddaughter through her late son Alireza Pahlavi and his companion Raha Didevar.\n\n\nIn 2003, Farah Pahlavi wrote a book about her marriage to Mohammad Reza entitled \"\". The publication of the former Empress's memoirs attracted international interest. It was a best-seller in Europe, with excerpts appearing in news magazines and the author appearing on talk shows and in other media outlets. However, opinion about the book, which \"Publishers Weekly\" called \"a candid, straightforward account\" and \"the Washington Post\" called \"engrossing\", was mixed.\n\nElaine Sciolino, \"The New York Times\"'s Paris bureau chief, gave the book a less than flattering review, describing it as \"well translated\" but \"full of anger and bitterness\". But \"National Review's\" Reza Bayegan, an Iranian writer, praised the memoir as \"abound[ing] with affection and sympathy for her countrymen.\"\n\nIn 2009 the Persian-Swedish director Nahid Persson Sarvestani released a feature length documentary about Farah Pahlavi's life, entitled \"The Queen and I\". The film was screened in various International film festivals such as IDFA and Sundance. In 2012 the Dutch director Kees Roorda made a theater play inspired by the life of Farah Pahlavi in exile. In the play Liz Snoijink acted as Farah Diba.\n\n\n\n\n\n|-\n"}

In US law, these rights belong to the holder of the copyright, who may sell (or \"option\") them to someone in the film industry—usually a producer or director, or sometimes a specialist broker of such properties—who will then try to gather industry professionals and secure the financial backing necessary to convert the property into a film. Such rights differ from the right to commercially exhibit a finished motion picture, which rights are usually referred to as \"exhibition rights\" or \"public-performance rights\".\n\nIn the United States, the need to secure film rights of previously published or produced source materials still under copyright stems from case law. In 1907, the Kalem Company produced a one-reel silent film version of General Lew Wallace's novel \"\" without first securing film rights. Wallace's estate and his American publisher, Harper & Brothers sued for copyright infringement. The United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, establishing the precedent that all adaptations are subject to copyright.\n\nWhen producers option a script, they are purchasing the right to buy certain rights to intellectual property. A general option fee is 10% of the cost of the rights, should the producers manage to secure full financing for their project and have it \"greenlit\". Because few projects actually manage to be greenlit, options allow producers to reduce their loss in the event that a project fails to come to fruition. Should the project be greenlit, an option provides a legally binding guarantee to purchase the film rights.\n\nThe contract for an option will specify the length of time it is valid for. If the producer is unable to have their project greenlit within the specified timeframe (e.g. two years), the option will expire. The rights holder can then put the previously optioned rights up for sale again. Or, the contract may allow the producer to renew the option for a certain price.\n\nAs it is common for scripts to be stuck in development hell, the options for a script may expire and be resold on multiple occasions. As well, producers who purchase an option and rework the script own the rights to their own derivative work- while the original rights holder owns the underlying rights. This lineage is referred to as the chain of title. This lineage can become cloudy if the underlying rights are divided. Producers may purchase the rights to a specific region (i.e. a country, the entire world, or the universe) and/or they may purchase ancillary rights such as merchandising rights.\n\nIn some cases, it may be uncertain as to the exact owners of a particular version of a script and to the exact set of rights. It is important for an entertainment lawyer to determine how 'clean' a chain of title is.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12557", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12557", "title": "Gilles Deleuze", "text": "Gilles Deleuze\n\nGilles Deleuze (; ; 18 January 1925 – 4 November 1995) was a French philosopher who, from the early 1960s until his death in 1995, wrote on philosophy, literature, film, and fine art. His most popular works were the two volumes of \"Capitalism and Schizophrenia\": \"Anti-Oedipus\" (1972) and \"A Thousand Plateaus\" (1980), both co-written with psychoanalyst Félix Guattari. His metaphysical treatise \"Difference and Repetition\" (1968) is considered by many scholars to be his magnum opus. A. W. Moore, citing Bernard Williams's criteria for a great thinker, ranks Deleuze among the \"greatest philosophers\". His work has influenced a variety of disciplines across philosophy and art, including literary theory, post-structuralism and postmodernism.\n\nDeleuze was born into a middle-class family in Paris and lived there for most of his life. His initial schooling was undertaken during World War II, during which time he attended the Lycée Carnot. He also spent a year in khâgne at the Lycée Henri IV. During the Nazi occupation of France, Deleuze's older brother, Georges, was arrested for his participation in the French Resistance, and died while in transit to a concentration camp. In 1944, Deleuze went to study at the Sorbonne. His teachers there included several noted specialists in the history of philosophy, such as Georges Canguilhem, Jean Hyppolite, Ferdinand Alquié, and Maurice de Gandillac, and Deleuze's lifelong interest in the canonical figures of modern philosophy owed much to these teachers. In addition, Deleuze found the work of non-academic writers such as Jean-Paul Sartre attractive.\n\nDeleuze passed the agrégation in philosophy in 1948, and taught at various lycées (Amiens, Orléans, Louis le Grand) until 1957, when he took up a position at the University of Paris. In 1953, he published his first monograph, \"Empiricism and Subjectivity\", on David Hume. This monograph was based on his DES thesis (\"\", roughly equivalent to an MA thesis) which was conducted under the direction of Hyppolite and Canguilhem. From 1960 to 1964 he held a position at the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique. During this time he published the seminal \"Nietzsche and Philosophy\" (1962) and befriended Michel Foucault. From 1964 to 1969 he was a professor at the University of Lyon. In 1968 he published his two dissertations, \"Difference and Repetition\" (supervised by Gandillac) and \"Expressionism in Philosophy: Spinoza\" (supervised by Alquié).\n\nIn 1969 he was appointed to the University of Paris VIII at Vincennes/St. Denis, an experimental school organized to implement educational reform. This new university drew a number of talented scholars, including Foucault (who suggested Deleuze's hiring) and the psychoanalyst Félix Guattari. Deleuze taught at Vincennes until his retirement in 1987.\n\nHe married Denise Paul \"Fanny\" Grandjouan in 1956. When once asked to talk about his life, he replied: \"Academics' lives are seldom interesting.\" Deleuze concludes his reply to this critic thus:\n\nDeleuze was an atheist.\n\nDeleuze, who had suffered from respiratory ailments from a young age, developed tuberculosis in 1968 and underwent a thoracoplasty (lung removal). He suffered increasingly severe respiratory symptoms for the rest of his life. In the last years of his life, simple tasks such as writing required laborious effort. On November 4, 1995, he committed suicide, throwing himself from the window of his apartment.\n\nPrior to his death, Deleuze had announced his intention to write a book entitled \"La Grandeur de Marx\" (\"The Greatness of Marx\"), and left behind two chapters of an unfinished project entitled \"Ensembles and Multiplicities\" (these chapters have been published as the essays \"Immanence: A Life\" and \"The Actual and the Virtual\"). He is buried in the cemetery of the village of Saint-Léonard-de-Noblat.\n\nDeleuze's works fall into two groups: on one hand, monographs interpreting the work of other philosophers (Baruch Spinoza, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Nietzsche, Henri Bergson, Michel Foucault) and artists (Marcel Proust, Franz Kafka, Francis Bacon); on the other, eclectic philosophical tomes organized by concept (e.g., difference, sense, events, schizophrenia, cinema, philosophy).\n\nDeleuze's main philosophical project in the works he wrote prior to his collaborations with Guattari can be baldly summarized as an inversion of the traditional metaphysical relationship between identity and difference. Traditionally, difference is seen as derivative from identity: e.g., to say that \"X is different from Y\" assumes some X and Y with at least relatively stable identities (as in Plato's forms). To the contrary, Deleuze claims that all identities are effects of difference. Identities are neither logically nor metaphysically prior to difference, Deleuze argues, \"given that there exist differences of nature between things of the same genus.\" That is, not only are no two things ever the same, the categories we use to identify individuals in the first place derive from differences. Apparent identities such as \"X\" are composed of endless series of differences, where \"X\" = \"the difference between x and x'\", and \"x'\" = \"the difference between...\", and so forth. Difference, in other words, goes all the way down. To confront reality honestly, Deleuze argues, we must grasp beings exactly as they are, and concepts of identity (forms, categories, resemblances, unities of apperception, predicates, etc.) fail to attain what he calls \"difference in itself.\" \"If philosophy has a positive and direct relation to things, it is only insofar as philosophy claims to grasp the thing itself, according to what it is, in its difference from everything it is not, in other words, in its \"internal difference\".\"\n\nLike Kant, Deleuze considers traditional notions of space and time as unifying forms imposed by the subject. He therefore concludes that pure difference is non-spatio-temporal; it is an idea, what Deleuze calls \"the virtual\". (The coinage refers to Proust's definition of what is constant in both the past and the present: \"real without being actual, ideal without being abstract.\") While Deleuze's virtual ideas superficially resemble Plato's forms and Kant's ideas of pure reason, they are not originals or models, nor do they transcend possible experience; instead they are the conditions of actual experience, the internal difference in itself. \"The concept they [the conditions] form is identical to its object.\" A Deleuzean idea or concept of difference is therefore not a wraith-like abstraction of an experienced thing, it is a real system of differential relations that creates actual spaces, times, and sensations.\n\nThus, Deleuze at times refers to his philosophy as a transcendental empiricism (), alluding to Kant. In Kant's transcendental idealism, experience only makes sense when organized by forms of sensibility (namely, space and time) and intellectual categories (such as causality). Assuming the content of these forms and categories to be qualities of the world as it exists independently of our perceptual access, according to Kant, spawns seductive but senseless metaphysical beliefs (for example, extending the concept of causality beyond possible experience results in unverifiable speculation about a first cause). Deleuze inverts the Kantian arrangement: experience exceeds our concepts by presenting novelty, and this raw experience of difference actualizes an idea, unfettered by our prior categories, forcing us to invent new ways of thinking (see \"Epistemology\").\n\nSimultaneously, Deleuze claims that being is univocal, i.e., that all of its senses are affirmed in one voice. Deleuze borrows the doctrine of \"ontological univocity\" from the medieval philosopher John Duns Scotus. In medieval disputes over the nature of God, many eminent theologians and philosophers (such as Thomas Aquinas) held that when one says that \"God is good\", God's goodness is only analogous to human goodness. Scotus argued to the contrary that when one says that \"God is good\", the goodness in question is exactly the same sort of goodness that is meant when one says \"Jane is good\". That is, God only differs from us in degree, and properties such as goodness, power, reason, and so forth are univocally applied, regardless of whether one is talking about God, a person, or a flea.\n\nDeleuze adapts the doctrine of univocity to claim that being is, univocally, difference. \"With univocity, however, it is not the differences which are and must be: it is being which is Difference, in the sense that it is said of difference. Moreover, it is not we who are univocal in a Being which is not; it is we and our individuality which remains equivocal in and for a univocal Being.\" Here Deleuze at once echoes and inverts Spinoza, who maintained that everything that exists is a modification of the one substance, God or Nature. For Deleuze, there is no one substance, only an always-differentiating process, an origami cosmos, always folding, unfolding, refolding. Deleuze summarizes this ontology in the paradoxical formula \"pluralism = monism\".\n\n\"Difference and Repetition\" (1968) is Deleuze's most sustained and systematic attempt to work out the details of such a metaphysics, but his other works develop similar ideas. In \"Nietzsche and Philosophy\" (1962), for example, reality is a play of forces; in \"Anti-Oedipus\" (1972), a \"body without organs\"; in \"What is Philosophy?\" (1991), a \"plane of immanence\" or \"chaosmos\".\n\nDeleuze's unusual metaphysics entails an equally atypical epistemology, or what he calls a transformation of \"the image of thought\". According to Deleuze, the traditional image of thought, found in philosophers such as Aristotle, René Descartes, and Edmund Husserl, misconceives of thinking as a mostly unproblematic business. Truth may be hard to discover—it may require a life of pure theorizing, or rigorous computation, or systematic doubt—but thinking is able, at least in principle, to correctly grasp facts, forms, ideas, etc. It may be practically impossible to attain a God's-eye, neutral point of view, but that is the ideal to approximate: a disinterested pursuit that results in a determinate, fixed truth; an orderly extension of common sense. Deleuze rejects this view as papering over the metaphysical flux, instead claiming that genuine thinking is a violent confrontation with reality, an involuntary rupture of established categories. Truth changes what we think; it alters what we think is possible. By setting aside the assumption that thinking has a natural ability to recognize the truth, Deleuze says, we attain a \"thought without image\", a thought always determined by problems rather than solving them. \"All this, however, presupposes codes or axioms which do not result by chance, but which do not have an intrinsic rationality either. It's just like theology: everything about it is quite rational if you accept sin, the immaculate conception, and the incarnation. Reason is always a region carved out of the irrational—not sheltered from the irrational at all, but traversed by it and only defined by a particular kind of relationship among irrational factors. Underneath all reason lies delirium, and drift.\"\n\nDeleuze's peculiar readings of the history of philosophy stem from this unusual epistemological perspective. To read a philosopher is no longer to aim at finding a single, correct interpretation, but is instead to present a philosopher's attempt to grapple with the problematic nature of reality. \"Philosophers introduce new concepts, they explain them, but they don't tell us, not completely anyway, the problems to which those concepts are a response. [...] The history of philosophy, rather than repeating what a philosopher says, has to say what he must have taken for granted, what he didn't say but is nonetheless present in what he did say.\"\n\nLikewise, rather than seeing philosophy as a timeless pursuit of truth, reason, or universals, Deleuze defines philosophy as the creation of concepts. For Deleuze, concepts are not identity conditions or propositions, but metaphysical constructions that define a range of thinking, such as Plato's ideas, Descartes's \"cogito\", or Kant's doctrine of the faculties. A philosophical concept \"posits itself and its object at the same time as it is created.\" In Deleuze's view, then, philosophy more closely resembles practical or artistic production than it does an adjunct to a definitive scientific description of a pre-existing world (as in the tradition of John Locke or Willard Van Orman Quine).\n\nIn his later work (from roughly 1981 onward), Deleuze sharply distinguishes art, philosophy, and science as three distinct disciplines, each analyzing reality in different ways. While philosophy creates concepts, the arts create novel qualitative combinations of sensation and feeling (what Deleuze calls \"percepts\" and \"affects\"), and the sciences create quantitative theories based on fixed points of reference such as the speed of light or absolute zero (which Deleuze calls \"functives\"). According to Deleuze, none of these disciplines enjoy primacy over the others: they are different ways of organizing the metaphysical flux, \"separate melodic lines in constant interplay with one another.\" For example, Deleuze does not treat cinema as an art representing an external reality, but as an ontological practice that creates different ways of organizing movement and time. Philosophy, science, and art are equally, and essentially, creative and practical. Hence, instead of asking traditional questions of identity such as \"is it true?\" or \"what is it?\", Deleuze proposes that inquiries should be functional or practical: \"what does it do?\" or \"how does it work?\"\n\nIn ethics and politics, Deleuze again echoes Spinoza, albeit in a sharply Nietzschean key. In a classical liberal model of society, morality begins from individuals, who bear abstract natural rights or duties set by themselves or a God. Following his rejection of any metaphysics based on identity, Deleuze criticizes the notion of an individual as an arresting or halting of differentiation (as the etymology of the word \"individual\" suggests). Guided by the naturalistic ethics of Spinoza and Nietzsche, Deleuze instead seeks to understand individuals and their moralities as products of the organization of pre-individual desires and powers.\n\nIn the two volumes of \"Capitalism and Schizophrenia\" (\"Anti-Oedipus\" (1972) and \"A Thousand Plateaus\" (1980)), Deleuze and Guattari describe history as a congealing and regimentation of \"desiring-production\" (a concept combining features of Freudian drives and Marxist labor) into the modern individual (typically neurotic and repressed), the nation-state (a society of continuous control), and capitalism (an anarchy domesticated into infantilizing commodification). Deleuze, following Karl Marx, welcomes capitalism's destruction of traditional social hierarchies as liberating, but inveighs against its homogenization of all values to the aims of the market. \n\nThe first part of \"Capitalism and Schizophrenia\" undertakes a universal history and posits the existence of a separate socius (the social body that takes credit for production) for each mode of production: the earth for the tribe, the body of the despot for the empire, and capital for capitalism.\"\n\nIn his 1990 essay \"Postscript on the Societies of Control\" (\"Post-scriptum sur les sociétés de contrôle\"), Deleuze builds on Foucault's notion of the society of discipline to argue that society is undergoing a shift in structure and control. Where societies of discipline were characterized by discrete physical enclosures (such as schools, factories, prisons, office buildings, etc.), institutions and technologies introduced since World War II have dissolved the boundaries between these enclosures. As a result, social coercion and discipline have moved into the lives of individuals considered as \"masses, samples, data, markets, or 'banks'.\" The mechanisms of modern societies of control are described as continuous, following and tracking individuals throughout their existence via transaction records, mobile location tracking, and other personally identifiable information.\n\nBut how does Deleuze square his pessimistic diagnoses with his ethical naturalism? Deleuze claims that standards of value are internal or immanent: to live well is to fully express one's power, to go to the limits of one's potential, rather than to judge what exists by non-empirical, transcendent standards. Modern society still suppresses difference and alienates persons from what they can do. To affirm reality, which is a flux of change and difference, we must overturn established identities and so become all that we can become—though we cannot know what that is in advance. The pinnacle of Deleuzean practice, then, is creativity. \"Herein, perhaps, lies the secret: to bring into existence and not to judge. If it is so disgusting to judge, it is not because everything is of equal value, but on the contrary because what has value can be made or distinguished only by defying judgment. What expert judgment, in art, could ever bear on the work to come?\"\n\nDeleuze's studies of individual philosophers and artists are purposely heterodox. In \"Nietzsche and Philosophy\", for example, Deleuze claims that Nietzsche's \"On the Genealogy of Morality\" (1887) is an attempt to rewrite Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason\" (1781), even though Nietzsche nowhere mentions the First Critique in the \"Genealogy\", and the \"Genealogy\"'s moral topics are far removed from the epistemological focus of Kant's book. Likewise, Deleuze claims that univocity is the organizing principle of Spinoza's philosophy, despite the total absence of the term from any of Spinoza's works. Deleuze once famously described his method of interpreting philosophers as \"buggery (\"enculage\")\", as sneaking behind an author and producing an offspring which is recognizably his, yet also monstrous and different.\n\nThe various monographs thus are not attempts to present what Nietzsche or Spinoza strictly intended, but re-stagings of their ideas in different and unexpected ways. Deleuze's peculiar readings aim to enact the creativity he believes is the acme of philosophical practice. A parallel in painting Deleuze points to is Francis Bacon's \"Study after Velázquez\"—it is quite beside the point to say that Bacon \"gets Velasquez wrong\". Similar considerations apply, in Deleuze's view, to his own uses of mathematical and scientific terms, \"pace\" critics such as Alan Sokal: \"I'm not saying that Resnais and Prigogine, or Godard and Thom, are doing the same thing. I'm pointing out, rather, that there are remarkable similarities between scientific creators of functions and cinematic creators of images. And the same goes for philosophical concepts, since there are distinct concepts of these spaces.\"\n\nIn the 1960s, Deleuze's portrayal of Nietzsche as a metaphysician of difference rather than a reactionary mystic contributed greatly to the plausibility and popularity of \"left-wing Nietzscheanism\" as an intellectual stance. His books \"Difference and Repetition\" (1968) and \"The Logic of Sense\" (1969) led Michel Foucault to declare that \"one day, perhaps, this century will be called Deleuzian.\" (Deleuze, for his part, said Foucault's comment was \"a joke meant to make people who like us laugh, and make everyone else livid.\") In the 1970s, the \"Anti-Oedipus\", written in a style by turns vulgar and esoteric, offering a sweeping analysis of the family, language, capitalism, and history via eclectic borrowings from Freud, Marx, Nietzsche, and dozens of other writers, was received as a theoretical embodiment of the anarchic spirit of May 1968. In 1994 and 1995, \"L'Abécédaire de Gilles Deleuze\", an eight-hour series of interviews between Deleuze and Claire Parnet, aired on France's Arte Channel.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, almost all of Deleuze's books were translated into English. Deleuze's work is frequently cited in English-speaking academia (in 2007, e.g., he was the 11th most frequently cited author in English-speaking publications in the humanities, between Freud and Kant). Like his contemporaries Foucault, Jacques Derrida, and Jean-François Lyotard, Deleuze's influence has been most strongly felt in North American humanities departments, particularly in literary theory, where \"Anti-Oedipus\" and \"A Thousand Plateaus\" are oft regarded as major statements of post-structuralism and postmodernism, though neither Deleuze nor Guattari described their work in those terms. Likewise in the English-speaking academy, Deleuze's work is typically classified as continental philosophy.\n\nDeleuze has attracted critics as well. The following list is not exhaustive, and gives only the briefest of summaries.\n\nAmong French philosophers, Vincent Descombes argues that Deleuze's account of a difference that is not derived from identity (in \"Nietzsche and Philosophy\") is incoherent, and that his analysis of history in \"Anti-Oedipus\" is 'utter idealism', criticizing reality for falling short of a non-existent ideal of schizophrenic becoming. According to Pascal Engel, Deleuze's metaphilosophical approach makes it impossible to reasonably disagree with a philosophical system, and so destroys meaning, truth, and philosophy itself. Engel summarizes Deleuze's metaphilosophy thus: \"When faced with a beautiful philosophical concept you should just sit back and admire it. You should not question it.\" Alain Badiou claims that Deleuze's metaphysics only apparently embraces plurality and diversity, remaining at bottom monist. Badiou further argues that, in practical matters, Deleuze's monism entails an ascetic, aristocratic fatalism akin to ancient Stoicism.\n\nOther European philosophers have criticized Deleuze's theory of subjectivity. For example, Manfred Frank claims that Deleuze's theory of individuation as a process of bottomless differentiation fails to explain the unity of consciousness. Slavoj Žižek claims that Deleuze's ontology oscillates between materialism and idealism, and that the Deleuze of \"Anti-Oedipus\" (\"arguably Deleuze's worst book\"), the \"political\" Deleuze under the \"'bad' influence\" of Guattari, ends up, despite protestations to the contrary, as \"the ideologist of late capitalism\". Žižek also calls Deleuze to task for allegedly reducing the subject to \"just another\" substance and thereby failing to grasp the nothingness that, according to Lacan and Žižek, defines subjectivity. What remains worthwhile in Deleuze's oeuvre, Žižek finds, are precisely those concepts closest to Žižek's own ideas.\n\nEnglish-speaking philosophers have also criticized aspects of Deleuze's work. Stanley Rosen objects to Deleuze's interpretation of Nietzsche's eternal return. Todd May argues that Deleuze's claim that difference is ontologically primary ultimately contradicts his embrace of immanence, i.e., his monism. However, May believes that Deleuze can discard the primacy-of-difference thesis, and accept a Wittgensteinian holism without significantly altering his practical philosophy. Peter Hallward argues that Deleuze's insistence that being is necessarily creative and always-differentiating entails that his philosophy can offer no insight into, and is supremely indifferent to, the material, actual conditions of existence. Thus Hallward claims that Deleuze's thought is literally other-worldly, aiming only at a passive contemplation of the dissolution of all identity into the theophanic self-creation of nature.\n\nIn \"Fashionable Nonsense\" (1997), physicists Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont accuse Deleuze of abusing mathematical and scientific terms, particularly by sliding between accepted technical meanings and his own idiosyncratic use of those terms in his works. Sokal and Bricmont state that they don't object to metaphorical reasoning, including with mathematical concepts, but mathematical and scientific terms are useful only insofar as they are precise. They give examples of mathematical concepts being \"abused\" by taking them out of their intended meaning, rendering the idea into normal language reduces it to truism or nonsense. In their opinion, Deleuze used mathematical concepts about which the typical reader might be not knowledgeable, and thus served to display erudition rather than enlightening the reader. Sokal and Bricmont state that they only deal with the \"abuse\" of mathematical and scientific concepts and explicitly suspend judgment about Deleuze's wider contributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1634060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1634060", "title": "Le Spleen de Paris", "text": "Le Spleen de Paris\n\nLe Spleen de Paris, also known as Paris Spleen or Petits Poèmes en prose, is a collection of 50 short prose poems by Charles Baudelaire. The collection was published posthumously in 1869 and is associated with literary modernism.\n\nBaudelaire mentions he had read Aloysius Bertrand's \"Gaspard de la nuit\" (considered the first example of prose poetry) at least twenty times before starting this work. Though inspired by Bertrand, Baudelaire's prose poems were based on Parisian contemporary life instead of the medieval background which Bertrand employed. He said of his work: \"These are the flowers of evil again, but with more freedom, much more detail, and much more mockery.\" Indeed, many of the themes and even titles from Baudelaire's earlier collection \"Les Fleurs du mal\" are revisited in this work.\n\nThese poems have no particular order, have no beginning and no end and they can be read like thoughts or short stories in a stream of consciousness style. The point of the poems is \"to capture the beauty of life in the modern city,\" using what Jean-Paul Sartre has labeled as being his existential outlook on his surroundings.\n\nPublished twenty years after the fratricidal June Days that ended the ideal or \"brotherly\" revolution of 1848, Baudelaire makes no attempts at trying to reform society he has grown up in but realizes the inequities of the progressing modernization of Paris. In poems such as \"The Eyes of the Poor\" where he writes (after witnessing an impoverished family looking in on a new cafe): \"Not only was I moved by that family of eyes, but I felt a little ashamed of our glasses and decanters, larger than our thirst...\", showing his feelings of despair and class guilt.\n\nThe title of the work refers not to the abdominal organ (the spleen) but rather to the second, more literary meaning of the word, \"melancholy with no apparent cause, characterised by a disgust with everything\".\n\n\"Le Spleen de Paris\" explores the idea of pleasure as a vehicle for expressing emotion. Many of the poems refer to sex or sin explicitly (i.e. \"Double Bedroom,\" \"A Hemisphere in a Head of Hair\", \"Temptations\"); others use subtle language and imagery to evoke sensuality (i.e. \"the Artist's Confiteor\"). In both cases, the diction is undeniably sexual; for example, in \"Double Bedroom\", \"Muslin rains abundantly over the windows and around the bed in a snowy cascade. Within this bed is ensconced the Idol, queen of dreams.\" Baudelaire's obsession with pleasure reflects his love for scandal and wickedness, as well as his philosophy that by seeking pleasure, man taps into his authentic \"evil\" self.\n\nMany of Baudelaire's prose poems openly advocate drinking and intoxication, such as \"Be Drunk\". Intoxication (or any equal pleasure such as creative work, sex, virtue, etc.) creates a euphoria and timelessness that allows you to transcend the limitations of time and truly live \"in the moment\". In \"Be Drunk\", the speaker commands the reader to engage in something intoxicating: \"You must be drunk always... Time crushes your shoulders and bends you earthward, you must be drunk without respite.\" Sobriety, in contrast, forces you to address the harsh realities of the world around you. However, this interpretation has recently been challenged by some critics, who claim that Baudelaire was actually being ironic in his advocacy for drunkenness. Maria Scott, a literary scholar, claims that Baudelaire believed \"artificial toxication was ... far inferior to 'successive work' and the 'regular exercise of will', that artificial stimulants ... actually \"amplify\" time.\" Thus, it is debatable whether intoxication refers to literal drunkenness as an escape or if symbolizes the pleasure found in writing and expressing oneself.\n\nIn \"Le Spleen de Paris\", the concept of artist and poet intermingle. Baudelaire saw poetry as a form of art, and thus in many of the prose poems the artist is a substitute for a traditional poet or speaker. In \"The Desire to Paint\", the artist attempts to depict his beautiful muse with images, just as the poet attempts to express his emotions with language. The relationship between the artist and poet reflects the need to evoke a particular feeling or idea, and this thread is carried through almost every single poem in the text. Ultimately, the artist and the poet become one, since they share the same purpose – to describe beauty. In this sense, the work itself (and every individual poem within) is beautiful, a \"work of art\" due to its innovative, interesting form. Thus, the poem, according to Baudelaire, is as much an \"aesthetic experience\" as it is a literary one.\n\nWomen are both admired and ridiculed in \"Le Spleen de Paris\". Some poems, such as \"The Desire to Paint\", reflect female power and sexuality in a somewhat positive manner. However, a larger portion of the poems in Baudelaire's work debase women as evil, gaudy, and cold. Many are represented as prostitutes, and according to scholars, \"the courtesan would seem to be a virtual incarnation, for Baudelaire, of all that is artificial and misleading.\" In \"The Rope\", the speaker's apprentice hangs himself, and his mother comes to collect the rope. The speaker is shocked to discover that she did so not to \"preserve them as horrible and precious relics\", but to sell them for a morbid profit. Baudelaire rejects the concept of maternal love and replaces it with a cold economic reality. Still, women are inherently sexual, and in some regards, Baudelaire admires their sensual beauty (connects back to themes of intoxication, pleasure).\n\nMany of Baudelaire's prose poems are dominated by the concept of time, usually negatively. The speaker in \"Le Spleen de Paris\" fears the passage of time and his/her own mortality. As a result, intoxication, women, pleasure, and writing are all forms of escape from this unavoidable hell. \"Be Drunk\" and \"Already!\" exemplify Baudelaire's infatuation with the idea of time. In \"Already!\" the speaker is incapable of matching the infiniteness and simplicity of nature, and at the end, comes face to face with his own death: \"I felt pulled down deathwards; which is why, when companions said, 'At last!' I could only cry, \"'Already!\"\" Also, this theme supports Baudelaire's admiration of art and poetry because although man cannot defeat time and death, a work of art can. Art, poetry, life, and death are inextricably linked within Baudelaire's poems, and perhaps reflect a personal obsession with mortality.\n\nFor Baudelaire, the setting of most poems within \"Le Spleen de Paris\" is the Parisian metropolis, specifically the poorer areas within the city. Notable poems within \"Le Spleen de Paris\" whose urban setting is important include “Crowds” and “The Old Mountebank.” Within his writing about city life, Baudelaire seems to stress the relationship between individual and society, frequently placing the speaker in a reflective role looking out at the city. It is also important to note that Baudelaire's Paris is not one of nice shops and beautiful streets. Instead, Baudelaire focuses on dirty, poverty-stricken areas of Paris with social problems rather than the Paris of the upper class.\n\nIn connection with the theme of the Parisian metropolis, Baudelaire focuses heavily on the theme of poverty and social class within \"Le Spleen de Paris\". Important poems from the collection which embody these themes include \"The Toy of the Poor\", \"The Eyes of the Poor\", \"Counterfeit Money\", and \"Let's Beat Up the Poor\". In these poems Baudelaire introduces slightly differing views of the urban poor. In \"The Toy of the Poor\" Baudelaire heavily stresses the need for equality between social classes in Paris. In comparison, \"Counterfeit Money\" and \"Let's Beat Up the Poor\" seem to use a sarcastic tone to instil empathy in the reader for those people in poverty. In Michael Hamburger's introduction to his translation, \"Twenty Prose Poems of Baudelaire\", the scholar notes a highly sympathetic view of the poor in \"Le Spleen de Paris\"; Baudelaire seems to relate to the poor and becomes an advocate for them in his poetry.\n\nMany poems in \"Le Spleen de Paris\" incorporate a central theme of religion or the relationship between good and evil in human nature. \"Cake\", which centers on a moral battle addressing the question of whether humans are inherently good or evil stands out as an especially important poem within the collection. \"Loss of a Halo\" also incorporates similar themes, literally discussing the role of angels as well as the relationship between mankind and religious ideology, questioning the goodness of Christian ideals. Along these lines, Baudelaire repeatedly addresses the theme of sin within his poetry as well as questioning how the hierarchy of class could affect the hierarchy of goodness, implying that those of higher social class tend not to be morally superior to those of lower classes. Many critics of Baudelaire address the prominent role of religion in the poet's life and how that might have affected his writing. Some suspect that since Baudelaire internalized Christian practices, he thought himself capable of accurately portraying God in his writing. Yet by representing God's message within his poetry, Baudelaire placed himself in a position of patriarchal authority, similar to that of the God depicted in Christianity.\n\nThe following passage is taken from the preface to the 2008 Mackenzie translation of \"Le Spleen de Paris\", entitled \"To Arsène Houssaye\":\n\nWhile writing \"Le Spleen de Paris\", Baudelaire made very conscious decisions regarding his relationship with his readers. As seen in the preface to the collection, addressed to his publisher, Arsène Houssaye, Baudelaire attempted to write a text that was very accessible to a reader while pulling the most appealing aspects of both prose and poetry and combining them into the revolutionary genre of prose poetry. For Baudelaire, the accessibility of the text and ability for a reader to set down the book and pick it up much later was crucial, especially considering his implied opinions of his readers. Baudelaire's tone throughout the preface, \"The Dog and the Vial\" as well as other poems throughout \"Le Spleen de Paris\" seem to illustrate Baudelaire's opinions of superiority over his readers. In \"The Dog and the Vial\", a man offers his dog a vial of fancy perfume to smell and the dog reacts in horror, instead wishing to sniff more seemingly unappealing smells, specifically excrement. The poem concludes with the frustration of the speaker with his dog, expressed as the speaker states: \"In this respect you, unworthy companion of my sad life, resemble the public, to whom one must never present the delicate scents that only exasperate them, but instead give them only dung, chosen with care\". One can extrapolate this poem to apply more figuratively to the larger themes of the poet-reader relationship, in which Baudelaire deprecates his readers, viewing them as unintelligent and incapable of appreciating his work.\n\n\"Le Spleen de Paris\" represents a definitive break from traditional poetic forms. The text is composed of \"prose poems\" which span the continuum between \"prosaic\" and \"poetic\" works. The new, unconventional form of poetry was characteristic of the modernist movement occurring throughout Europe (and particularly in Paris) at the time. In the preface to \"Le Spleen de Paris\", Baudelaire describes that modernity requires a new language, \"a miracle of a poetic prose, musical without rhythm or rhyme, supple enough and striking enough to suit lyrical movements of the soul, undulations of reverie, the flip-flops of consciousness\", and in this sense, \"Le Spleen de Paris\" gives life to modern language. Baudelaire's prose poetry tends to be more poetic in comparison to later works such as Ponge's Le parti pris des choses, but each poem varies. For an example of a more poetic poem, see \"Evening Twilight\"; for a prosaic example, see \"The Bad Glazier\".\n\nBaudelaire's \"Le Spleen de Paris\" is unique in that it was published posthumously by his sister in 1869, two years after Baudelaire died. In fact, it was not until his waning years, plagued by physical ailments and the contraction of syphilis that he created a table of contents for the book. Baudelaire spent years 1857 to 1867 working on his book of poems that chronicled daily life in the city of Paris. These poems aimed at capturing the times in which they were written, from the brutally repressed upheavals of 1848 (after which the government censored literature more than ever), the 1851 \"coup d'état\" of Louis Bonaparte and generally Paris of the 1850s, demolished and renovated by Napoleon III's prefect, Baron Haussman. In displaying the social antagonisms of the age, Baudelaire drew influence from many great artists of the time. In fact, an active critical essayist himself, his critical reviews of other poets \"elucidate the recesses of the mind that created \"Les Fleurs du Mal\" and \"Le Spleen de Paris\".\"\n\nInfluence: While there is much speculation regarding direct influence and inspiration in the creation of \"Le Spleen de Paris\", the following colleagues seem to have clearly influenced the book of small poems:\n\nEdgar Allan Poe: \"Indeed, Poe illustrates his claim with several examples which seem to summarize with uncanny precision the temperament of Baudelaire himself (Poe 273–4). The affinity between the two writers in this regard seems beyond dispute ... Moreover, 'Le Démon de la perversité' is less a tale than a prose poem, and both its subject-matter and its movement from general considerations to specific examples leading to an unexpected conclusion may have influenced Baudelaire in his creation of \"Le Spleen de Paris\".\"\n\nAloysius Betrand's \"Gaspard de la nuit\": Baudelaire himself is quoted as citing this work as an inspiration for \"Paris Spleen\".\n\nGustave Flaubert: Magazine article \"No ideas but in Crowds: Baudelaire's \"Paris Spleen\"\" cites similarities between the writers in that like Baudelaire, Flaubert held the same motives and intentions in that he too wanted \"to write the moral history of the men of my generation – or, more accurately, the history of their feelings.\"\n\nCritical reception: The way in which the poem was received certainly lends to understanding the climate in which Baudelaire created \"Le Spleen de Paris\", in that \"It appears to be almost a diary entry, an explicit rundown of the day's events; those events seem to be precisely the kind that Charles Baudelaire would have experienced in the hectic and hypocritical world of the literary marketplace of his day.\"\n\nNotable critical reception: In order to truly understand how \"Le Spleen de Paris\" was received, one must first be acquainted with Baudelaire's earlier works. The repressions and upheavals of 1848 resulted in massive censorship of literature, which did not bode well for Baudelaire's perhaps most famous work, \"Les Fleurs du Mal\". Society was so shocked by the satanic references and sexual perversion in the book that at the time it was a critical and popular failure. This put the anticipated reception of \"Le Spleen de Paris\" at a disadvantage. Like \"Flowers of Evil\", it wasn't until much later that \"Paris Spleen\" was fully appreciated for what it was, a masterpiece that \"brought the style of the prose poem to the broader republics of the people\". That being said, just four years after Arthur Rimbaud used Baudelaire's work as a foundation for his poems, as he considered Baudelaire a great poet and pioneer of prose.\n\nAppearance in Media: A 2006 film \"Spleen\", written by Eric Bomba-Ire, borrowed its title from Baudelaire's book of prose poems. Baudelaire expressed a particular feeling that he called 'Spleen' which is a mixture of melancholy, rage, eros, and resignation, which ties in well with the movie's darkly woven tale of love, betrayal and passion.\n\nIn \"Let us beat up the poor\", Baudelaire makes up a parable about economic and social equality: no one is entitled to it; it belongs to those who can win it and keep it. And he taunts the social reformer: \"What do you think of that, Proudhon?\"\n\n\"At One in the Morning\" is like a diary entry, a rundown of the day's events. In it, Baudelaire recognizes that he is part of a society full of hypocrites. His individual self becomes \"blurred...by a hypocrisy and perverseness which progressively undermine the difference between the self and others.\" This is at least partly what Baudelaire meant by \"a modern and more abstract life.\"\n\n\"The Thyrsus\" is a piece addressed to composer Franz Liszt. The ancient Greek thyrsus had connotations of \"unleashed sexuality and violence, of the profound power of the irrational.\" Baudelaire believed the thyrsus to be an acceptable object of representation for Liszt's music.\n\nIn \"The Bad Windowpane Maker\" Baudelaire speaks of a \"kind of energy that springs from ennui and reverie\" that manifests itself in a particularly unexpected way in the most inactive dreamers. Doctors and moralists alike are at a loss to explain where such mad energy so suddenly comes from to these lazy people, why they suddenly feel the need to perform such absurd and dangerous deeds.\n\nThe prefatory letter Baudelaire wrote to Arsene Houssaye, the editor of \"La Presse\", was not necessarily intended to be included in the publication. When Baudelaire drew up his table of contents for the projected book form, he did not include the letter. It is possible, then, that the letter only appeared in \"La Presse\" as a means of flattery to ensure that Houssaye would publish the poems. Nevertheless, it allows us to understand Baudelaire's thinking about the genre of prose poetry:\n\nWho among us has not dreamed, in his ambitious days, of the miracle of a poetic prose, musical without rhythm or rhyme, supple enough and jarring enough to be adapted to the soul's lyrical movements, the undulations of reverie, to the twists and turns that consciousness takes?\nTo Arsène Houssaye\n\nSources\n\n"}

He is a former owner of The Ivy, Le Caprice and J Sheekey restaurants and a former part owner of Giraffe Restaurants.\n\nThe son of historian Paul Johnson and brother of Daniel Johnson, he spent his early years in Iver, Buckinghamshire, and was educated at the state run Langley Grammar School in Langley, Berkshire, and at Magdalen College, Oxford.\n\nWhilst at university Johnson together with fellow student Hugh Osmond (later founder of Punch Taverns) interviewed Richard Branson on his houseboat in London for the student newspaper. This gave the pair the inspiration to go into business and they began running the \"Era\" nightclub in Oxford. By the time of graduation, he and Osmond were running businesses from software to clubs.\n\nHe initially studied medicine but, like Hugh Osmond, only completed the first part of the course, graduating from Oxford University with a BA in Physiological Sciences in 1983. He began his career as a media analyst at stockbroker Grieveson Grant (subsequently Kleinwort Benson Securities).\n\nIn 1993, Johnson and Osmond took control of Pizza Express, with Johnson becoming chairman. They expanded the business from 12 owned restaurants to over 250, and the share price from 40p to over 900p. After selling the business in 1999 Johnson started Signature Restaurants, a ‘crown jewels’ collection of London restaurants which included The Ivy and Le Caprice, as well as the Belgo chain. He also started Strada restaurants from scratch, taking the chain to 30 units. He sold both businesses in 2005; the total proceeds from these two disposals were in excess of £90 million.\n\nWhilst chairman of the Belgo group, Johnson took part in the BBC programme \"Back to the Floor\", a programme in which top executives spent a week at the \"coal face\" of their business. Some reviewers of the programme were uncomplimentary about Johnson.\n\nFrom 1993 to date, Johnson has been involved as director and/or owner of various companies in retailing, pubs and bars, including Whittard of Chelsea, My Kinda Town and the private companies Giraffe, Druckers and Baker & Spice.. The latter two businesses became part of Patisserie Holdings (see below). In December 2009, Johnson's investment partnership Risk Capital Partners Ltd acquired the Tootsie's restaurant chain, for which it was awarded the \"Deal of the Year\" prize at the 2010 Retailer's Retailer Awards ceremony. Johnson also purchased in 2010 a stake in artisan bakery Flour Power City, which supplies restaurants, hotels, and caterers. Flour Power City also operates stalls in locations such as Borough Market in London. This business also became part of Patisserie Holdings.\n\nSeptember 2010 saw Johnson purchase Feng Sushi, a London-based chain of Japanese restaurants specialising in home delivery. In the same month he also purchased a majority stake in casual-dining firm Ego Group, which was merged in April 2011 with pizza business Rocket Restaurants to form 3Sixty Restaurants, with Johnson as chairman.\n\nIn May 2011, Risk Capital Partners assumed a shareholding in Bread Ltd, a leading artisan baker. The group includes retail bakery and cafe Gail's, which has twenty-two bakeries in London and sells its products through Waitrose, Harvey Nichols and Ocado. In June 2013 he became chairman and 50% owner of Grand Union, a London bar chain.\n\nJohnson is also the majority owner of contract catering firm Genuine Dining.\n\nIn May 2015, Risk Capital Partners announced its purchase of a majority stake in Zoggs, the global swimming products brand.\n\nIn 2016 he acquired a 12.5% stake in Elegant Hotels Group. He joined the board of Elegant Hotels as a non-executive director in May 2017.\n\nJohnson is the Executive Chairman, Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, and a 37% shareholder of Patisserie Holdings pl (London Stock Exchange EPIC code: CAKE ). The principal trading brand is Patisserie Valerie; the company's other brands include Druckers Vienna Patisserie, Philpotts, Baker & Spice, and Flour Power City Bakery. The company's auditor is Grant Thornton. \n\nOn 19 May 2014 the company was admitted to the Alternative Investment Market . The company had a market value of £446.13 million at close of business on 9th October 2018 , the closing price being quoted as 425.9 pence . That evening Sky News published a news item headed: 'Patisserie Valerie owner faces crisis 'over £20m accounting hole' .\n\nOn 10th October the company's shares were suspended from trading. An announcement included information that the board had been notified of significant and potentially fraudulent accounting irregularities, that a potential material mis-statement of the company's accounts had significantly impacted the company's cash position, and that Chris Marsh, the Chief Financial Officer, had been suspended from his role . \n\nOn 11 October the company announced that there was a material shortfall between the reported financial status and the current financial status of the business and that without an immediate injection of capital the directors were of the view that there would be no scope for the business to continue trading in its current form. This announcement also stated that the directors and the company's professional advisers were assessing all options available to the business to keep it trading..\n\nOn 12 October Hertfordshire police issued a statement saying that 'A 44-year old man from St Albans has been arrested on suspicion of fraud by false representation. He has been released under investigation.' It was widely reported that the individual concerned was Marsh , . The Serious Fraud Office announced on its website that it had opened an investigation into an individual at the company . Later that day the company announced details of a rescue plan under which it would borrow £20 million from Johnson and place 31,451,100 ordinary shares at 50 pence to raise new capital of approximately £15.7m before payment of expenses . Johnson faced the choice of letting the company fail (at which point he would still have been worth over £100m), or lending money to it, albeit on terms that the majority of the loans would be repaid by the proceeds of the placings. The rescue plan prevented the imminent bankruptcy of the company and subsequent loss of 2500 jobs, but was criticised in The Telegraph as being against the interests of smaller shareholders. \n\nOn 14 October it was reported that two unauthorised and unreported overdrafts of almost £10m had been discovered. \n\nJohnson was the only director of the company never to have sold shares after flotation . Earlier in 2018 Paul May, the company's CEO, and Marsh both exercised share options at a price of 418p, allegedly making £1 million and £680,000, respectively. At the end of June Lee Ginsberg, deputy chairman and head of the audit committee, sold 40,000 shares at 469p, making almost £190,000 . These figures relate to legitimate transactions pre-dating the crisis, with no suggestion that the board extracted cash from the company in such a way as to contribute to the alleged accounting fraud. \n\nThe events at the company have been criticised in a statement that 'If wonky accounting can go unnoticed at a plain-vanilla business like Patisserie Holdings, investors really have nowhere to feel safe.' \n\nSince 2000, Johnson has run Risk Capital Partners Ltd, focusing on private equity deals. Risk Capital Partner's portfolio includes the directory publisher Superbrands, fashion chain East, and GRA, the UK's largest greyhound track owner.\n\nIn May 2010, Johnson became a strategic investor in Beer & Partners, the UK's largest business investment agency. He is also a director of two theatre production partnerships, Playful Productions and Fiery Dragons, as well as director of AKA UK, a marketing agency to the live entertainment industry. In October 2011, Johnson became a non-executive director of Metro Bank plc. He was a non-executive director of art publisher Phaidon Press from August 2010 to October 2012.\n\nIn 1996 Johnson co-founded Integrated Dental Holdings, expanding it to become the UK's largest chain of dental surgeries, with over 500 dentists. The firm was sold in 2006 for over £100 million. From 2004 to 2006 Johnson was director of Dollar Financial Group Inc, a US NASDAQ traded corporation with $80m EBITDA. He was involved in parcel delivery and maritime commerce through Nightfreight and American Port Services.\n\nHe served as a non-executive director of Elderstreet VCT plc for ten years. Through Risk Capital Partners, Johnson was a founder, part-owner and director of recruitment business InterQuest Group plc. Risk Capital Partners is also a former investor in advertising and design group Loewy, which was sold in 2006, and formerly a part-owner of fresh fish distributor Seafood Holdings, sold in 2010 for £45m in total. Risk also held a stake in car park technology provider APT controls until 2014.\n\nLuke Johnson became Chairman and part-owner of Giraffe Restaurants in 2004. In 2013 he stepped down as Chairman, upon Giraffe's sale to Tesco for a reported £50m.\n\nAmong Johnson's business maxims are that, consciously or not, every successful company that he knows has followed kaizen, the Japanese management philosophy of constant, incremental improvements, often driven from the bottom up.\n\nJohnson has backed Vote Leave in the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016.\n\nJohnson was Chairman of Channel 4 Television Corporation from January 2004 to January 2010, during which time he appointed a new CEO, restructured the board and saw the organisation enjoy record ratings, revenues and surplus.\n\nHe writes a weekly column on business for \"The Sunday Times\". He wrote a weekly essay for the \"Financial Times\" from 2007 to 2015. From 1998 to 2006 he wrote \"The Maverick\", a weekly business column for \"The Sunday Telegraph\". An anthology of \"The Maverick\" columns was published by Harriman House in 2007.\n\nJohnson serves on the advisory board of cultural and political magazine \"Standpoint\".\n\nJohnson is chairman of the Institute of Cancer Research, assuming that role in August 2013.\n\nHe is a former Chairman of The Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA), completing a three-year term in October 2012. He was governor of The University of the Arts between 2000 and 2006. He was also Chairman of Action on Addiction from 2011 to 2012. In June 2012 Johnson was appointed Chairman of Startup Britain, the national campaign to stimulate start-up growth in the UK. Johnson is also Chairman of Career Colleges, an organisation planning 40 vocational colleges for 14- to 19-year-olds.\n\nIn October 2013 Johnson co-founded and launched the Centre for Entrepreneurs, a non-profit think-tank aiming to address the \"...under-represention of entrepreneurs in the public eye\" and to \"...promote entrepreneurship to government, media, the private sector (including big businesses) and the general public.\"\n\nWith Stephen Lambert and Christopher Hird, Johnson co-produced \"The Flaw\", a 2011 documentary film detailing the events leading up to the financial crash of 2008. The film takes its title from Alan Greenspan's admission to US Congress that he had been mistaken to put so much faith in the self-correcting power of free markets.\n\nJohnson is married, with three children and lives in London.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16864608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16864608", "title": "Miriam Schapiro", "text": "Miriam Schapiro\n\nMiriam Schapiro (also known as Mimi) (November 15, 1923 – June 20, 2015) was a Canadian-born artist based in the United States. She was a painter, sculptor, printmaker, and a pioneer of feminist art. She was also considered a leader of the Pattern and Decoration art movement. Schapiro's artwork blurs the line between fine art and craft. She incorporated craft elements into her paintings due to their association with women and femininity. Schapiro’s work touches on the issue of feminism and art: especially in the aspect of feminism in relation to abstract art. Schapiro honed in her domesticated craft work and was able to create work that stood amongst the rest of the high art. These works represent Schapiro’s identity as an artist working in the center of contemporary abstraction and simultaneously as a feminist being challenged to represent women’s \"consciousness\" through imagery. She often used icons that are associated with women, such as hearts, floral decorations, geometric patterns, and the color pink. In the 1970s she made the hand fan, a typically small woman's object, heroic by painting it six feet by twelve feet. \"The fan-shaped canvas, a powerful icon, gave Schapiro the opportunity to experiment... Out of this emerged a surface of textured coloristic complexity and opulence that formed the basis of her new personal style. The kimonos, fans, houses, and hearts were the form into which she repeatedly poured her feelings and desires, her anxieties, and hopes\". Miriam Schapiro's estate is exclusively represented by the Eric Firestone Gallery in New York.\n\nSchapiro was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. She was the only child of two Russian Jewish parents. Her Russian immigrant grandfather invented the first movable doll’s eye in the United States and manufactured \"Teddy Bears.\" Her father, Theodore Schapiro, was an artist and an intellectual who was studying at the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design, in New York, when Schapiro was born. He was an industrial design artist who fostered her desire to be an artist and served as her role model and mentor. Her mother, Fannie Cohen,a homemaker and a Zionist, encouraged Schapiro to take up a career in the arts. At age six, Schapiro began drawing.\n\nAs a teenager, Schapiro was taught by Victor d’ Amico, her first modernist teacher at the Museum of Modern Art. In the evenings she joined WPA classes for adults to study drawing from the nude model. In 1943, Schapiro entered Hunter College in New York City, but eventually transferred to the University of Iowa. At the University of Iowa, Schapiro studied painting with Stuart Edie and James Lechay. She studied printmaking under Mauricio Lasansky and was his personal assistant, which then led her to help form the Iowa Print Group. Lasanky taught his students to use several different printing techniques in their work and to study the masters' work in order to find solutions to technical problems.\n\nAt the State University of Iowa she met the artist Paul Brach, whom she married in 1946. After Brach and Schapiro graduated in 1949, Brach received a job in the University of Missouri as a painting instructor. Schapiro did not receive a position, and was very unhappy during their time there. By 1951 they moved to New York City and befriended many of the Abstract expressionist artists of the New York School, including Joan Mitchell, Larry Rivers, Knox Martin and Michael Goldberg. Schapiro and Brach lived in New York City during the 1950s and 1960s. Miriam and Paul had a son, Peter Brach, in 1955. Before and after the birth of her son Peter, Schapiro struggled with her identity and place as an artist. Miriam’s Schapiro’s successive studios, after this period of crisis, became both environments for and reflections of the changes in her life and art.\n\nShe died on June 20, 2015 in Hampton Bays, New York, aged 91.\n\nSchapiro not only honored the craft tradition in women's art, but also paid homage to women artists of the past. In the early 1970s she made paintings and collages which included photo reproductions of past artists such as Mary Cassatt. In the mid 1980s she painted portraits of Frida Kahlo on top of her old self-portrait paintings. In the 1990s Schapiro began to include women of the Russian Avant Garde in her work. The Russian Avant Garde was an important moment in Modern Art history for Schapiro to reflect on because women were seen as equals.\n\nBetween 1953 and 1957, Schapiro created a substantial body of work in which she focused on the dominant style of the period: Abstract Expressionism. Miriam created her own gestural language: \"painting thinly and wiping out\", in which the wiped area played a significant role as the painted area. Although these works were abstracted such as her work Beast Land and Plenty, Schapiro based them off of black and white illustrations of works by the \"old masters\". In December 1957, André Emmerich selected one of her paintings for the opening of his gallery.\n\nEarly in her career, Schapiro started looking for maternal symbols to unify her own roles as a woman. Her series, \"Shrines\" was created in 1961-63 with this in mind. Beginning in 1960 Schapiro began to eliminate abstract expressionist brushwork from her paintings and began to introduce a variety of geometric forms. It is one of her earliest group of work that was also an autobiography. Each section of the work show an aspect of being a woman artist. They are also symbolic of her body and soul. The play between the illusion of depth and the acceptance of the surface became the main formal strategy of Miriam's work for the rest of the decade. The Shrines enabled Schapiro to discover the multiple and fragmented aspects of herself.\n\nIn 1964 Schapiro and her husband Paul both worked at the Tamarind Lithography Workshop. One of Schapiro's biggest turning points in her art career was working at the workshop and experimenting with Josef Albers' Color-Aid paper, where she began making several new shrines and created her first collages.\n\nIn 1967, Schapiro and Brach moved to California so that both could teach in the art department at the University of California, San Diego. There Miriam met her close friend David Nalibof, a physicist who worked for General Dynamics. Nalibof formulated computer programs that could plot and alter Miriam Schapiro's drawings. This was how her first feminist work, \"Big Ox #1\" from 1968 was created. The diagonals of which represented the limbs of the \"Vitruvian man,\" while the O depicted the center of the women, the vagina, the womb. This work is described as \"a newly invented, body-based, archetypal emblem for female power and identity, realized in brilliant red-orange, silver, and 'tender shades of pink'\". The O is also thought to symbolize the egg, which exists as the window into the maternal structure with outstretched limbs.\n\nSubsequently, she was able to establish the Feminist Art Program at the California Institute of the Arts, in Valencia with Judy Chicago. The program set out to address the problems in the arts from an institutional position and focused on the expansion of a female environment in Downtown, L.A. In \"Womanhouse\" women were able to turn their invested creativity in rewarding their families with supportive environments toward themselves by allowing their fantasies to take over all rooms. They wanted the creation of art to be less of a private, introspective adventure and more of a public process through consciousness raising sessions, personal confessions and technical training. \"('House') became the repository of female fantasy and womanly dreams\". Schapiro participated in the \"Womanhouse\" exhibition in 1972. Schapiro's smaller piece within \"Womanhouse\", called \"Dollhouse\", was constructed using various scrap pieces to create all the furniture and accessories in the house. Each room signified a particular role a woman plays in society and depicted the conflicts between them.\n\nSchapiro's work from the 1970s onwards consists primarily of collages assembled from fabrics, which she called \"femmages\". In the early seventies, succeeding Schapiro’s collaboration in \"Womanhouse\", she made her first fabric collages in her studio in Los Angeles, which looked much like a room in a house. From the male technological world of computers Schapiro moved into a woman’s decorated house. In this home-like studio, Schapiro monumentalized her fabric cabinet and its significance for women, in a number of large femmages, including \"A Cabinet for All Seasons\". This was her poetic version of the representation of continuous changes and repetitions in all women’s bodies and lives. In her definition of femmage, Schapiro wrote that the style, which simultaneously recalls quilting and Cubism, has a \"woman-life context\" and that it \"celebrates a private or public event.\" As Schapiro traveled the United States giving lectures, she would ask the women she met for a souvenir. These souvenirs would be used in her collage like paintings. Schapiro also did collaborative art projects, like her series of etchings \"Anonymous was a Woman\" from 1977. She was able to produce the series with a group of nine women studio-art graduates from the University of Oregon. Each print is an impression made from an untransformed doily that was placed in soft ground on a zinc plate, then etched and printed.\n\nHer 1977-1978 essay \"Waste Not Want Not: An Inquiry into What Women Saved and Assembled - FEMMAGE\" (written with Melissa Meyer) describes femmage as the activities of collage, assemblage, découpage and photomontage practised by women using \"traditional women's techniques - sewing, piercing, hooking, cutting, appliquéing, cooking and the like...\"\n\nAfter 1975, Schapiro returned to New York and with what she made after selling some paintings, she not only had a room but a studio of her own. Decoration and \"collaboration,\" are central to her artwork and both play a significant role in her house as well as in her studio. The studio became Schapiro’s own room and at moments of great personal conflict, the only connection with her creative self. Her various studios throughout the span of her career have reflected the changes in both the outer and the inner realities of her life. They have expressed her changing self-conceptions in accordance with or in against society, which keeps gender roles separate. Schapiro's studios have also become metaphors for her creative work, as well as spaces in which she could live her life and fulfill her dreams as well.\n\nIn the process of taking on different projects, Schapiro’s studio expanded and eventually became portable, following her as she traveled from place to place. It was during the same time of her Oregon collaborative project with the nine women that Schapiro also created her first \"Collaboration Series\" with women artists of the past. This series combined reproductions of the work of Mary Cassatt and Berthe Morisot with colorful and sensuous fabric borders in patterns inspired by quilts. In \"Mary Cassatt and Me\", Schapiro overlapped her own mental image of her mother with Cassatt's maternal ideal–her mother reading a newspaper.\n\nIn the 1990s Schapiro began exploring her Jewish identity further in her painting. Her painting \"My History\" (1997) she used the same structure as the \"House\" project and built rooms of different memories surrounding her Jewish heritage. Her most explicit Jewish-themed statement in art was \"Four Matriarchs\", stained glass windows portraying the biblical heroines Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah. This was a colorful piece combining identity symbology and her older domesticated art to create the true vision of what high art meant to the public. \"Mother Russia\" (1994), was a fan piece made by Schapiro that drew from her family's Russian background. She depicts the powerful women from Russia each on a row of the hand held fan with a hat and a veil. She added pieces from each artist work in her \"collaborative\" style to join them as revolutionary women and give hidden figures praise. Her background in both the Russian and Jewish culture have very much attributed to what Schapiro’s collection of work represents. The foundation and collective use of patterns and colors describe Miriam's work and allow us to see her culture and female voice.\n\nSchapiro's works are held in numerous museum collections including the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Jewish Museum (New York), the National Gallery of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Her awards include the Distinguished Artist Award for Lifetime Achievement from the College Art Association and a 1987 Guggenheim Fellowship. Miriam Schapiro's estate is represented exclusively by Eric Firestone Gallery.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1210363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1210363", "title": "Nat Sherman", "text": "Nat Sherman\n\nNat Sherman is the brand name for a line of handmade cigars and \"luxury cigarettes.\" The company, which began as a retail tobacconist, continues to operate a flagship retail shop now located on 42nd Street, off Fifth Avenue, in New York City. Corporate offices are now located at the foot of the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, New Jersey.\n\nBefore he was involved in the tobacco industry, Nat Sherman made his fortune running a prominent speakeasy in New York City during the 1920s, when Prohibition made such a business extremely lucrative, albeit risky. Perhaps as the result of settlement of a gambling debt, his son later speculated, Sherman wound up as half owner of Traub Brothers and Bear, makers of the Epoca cigar brand, which introduced the nightclub proprietor into the world of tobacco manufacturing. Sherman subsequently bought out his partner to become sole owner of the Epoca brand, which was made in Havana, Cuba and Tampa, Florida.\n\nLater a prominent New York real estate developer named Abe Gubertz had cash-flow difficulties during the construction of a 38 story building located at 1400 Broadway, on Broadway in Manhattan. Sherman provided the struggling developer with a loan, taking retail space located in the lobby as partial payment. The shop sold cigarettes and cigars in substantial quantities to those who worked in the building and proved a means of distributing its own cigars, including Epoca and Nat Sherman-branded product. The company also was the exclusive importer and distributor of the Cuban-made Bolivar brand in the United States.\n\nIn the 1950s, an adjoining retail space was obtained on the street, which initially was used as a candy store. The wall between the two establishments was later broken down, paving the way for an expansion of the tobacco shop, which catered to an elite customer base, which included leaders in the fashion industry, theatre, and politicians. Prominent members of organized crime \"families\" also frequented the shop, which was regarded as \"neutral ground.\"\n\nNat Sherman's son Joel, company president and CEO into the 21st century, later recalled of the shop's most dangerous customers:\n\nIn 1950, Sherman introduced the plastic-tipped cigar to the industry, called Sherman's #25. The cigar was produced in Tampa for Sherman by Carl Cuesta, an American manufacturer of cigars for Partagas. The company applied for a patent for its cigar tip, which was never granted. Nevertheless, for 32 years the company successfully bluffed away rivals by marking its packaging with the words \"patent pending\" and by threatening legal action.\n\nSherman was also a pioneer in the manufacture of cigarettes which made use of cigar tobacco, launching a product called Havana Ovals #149 early in the 1950s. According to company lore, the move to specialty small cigars and cigarettes was made at the request of an irate customer who had been unable to smoke a cigar on an airplane and who had specifically requested a cigarette which tasted like a cigar.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the Sherman shop expanded its wares to include pipes. Over 1,000 pipes were offered for sale in a long case hung along the wall of the store. The company also began to sell pipe tobacco under the \"Nat Sherman\" brand name. At the time of its expansion, the company's pipe department was perhaps the largest in New York City and the United States.\n\nIn the 1960s, a move was made to expand both the wholesale operations of the company and its cigarette manufacturing arm. The company's previous manufacturing facility in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, was shuttered and a move made to a new and larger facility in Englewood, New Jersey.\n\nIn the autumn of 1976, Nat Sherman opened a shop on New York's Fifth Avenue to bolster his tobacco brand's status. A new location was opened at 711 Fifth Avenue, near the Plaza Hotel, across from Tiffany & Company. After a period of differences with his father, Joel Sherman left the business for about a decade.\n\nJoel Sherman returned to the company in 1990, the year after his father's death, He became the company's president and CEO, terminated many of the existing management staff, and set the company on the course of developing unique, elite, high-end products.\n\nThe company lost its lease at 711 Fifth Avenue and moved to a new location on 42nd Street, around the corner from the New York Public Library. A total of $1.5 million were spent on the development of the new store, which boasts an inventory of about 500,000 cigars and a second floor walk-in humidor and smoking room adorned with leather-backed chairs.\n\nSherman's cigar line Metropolitan has been manufactured since the 1990s by MATASA in the Dominican Republic. Its Gotham 1400 and Omerta products are manufactured and distributed by Santa Clara, Inc..

{"id": "7192391", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7192391", "title": "Naval heraldry", "text": "Naval heraldry\n\nNaval heraldry is a form of identification used by naval vessels from the end of the 19th century onwards, after distinguishing features such as figureheads and gilding were discouraged or banned by several navies.\n\nNaval heraldry commonly takes the form of a badge, seal, crest, or coat of arms designed specifically for a ship (or a series of ships bearing the same name), which in Commonwealth navies takes the form of a large plaque, referred to as the ship's badge, mounted on the superstructure of the ship, and in the United States Navy is known as the ship's seal or ship's crest, and is primarily found on crew uniform patches. An item of naval heraldry is seen as the identifying logo of the vessel, and is commonly reproduced on hats, stationery, trophies, souvenirs, and gifts related to the ship. In many navies, the ship's badge is also displayed on the tampions - the covers for the gun muzzles.\n\nThe naval heraldric tradition follows the heraldic traditions of the country, with some distinctive variations.\n\n\"Note: Although ships are commonly referred to in this article, identical or similar forms of heraldry are used for bases and facilities, organisational divisions, and land-based naval units.\"\n\nThe system of naval heraldry used by the Portuguese Navy was established and regulated in 1972, being slightly reviewed by an ordinance of February 18, 2010. \n\nThe coats of arms consist of a round tip shield (Portuguese shield), topped by a naval crown and under which is placed a scroll with the motto or the name of the body or unit. A scroll with the war cry of the unit can be placed above the naval crown. The coat of arms may also include tenants or supporters, trophies and decorations. A coat of arms can also be used as a badge, in which case an entirely round shield is used, surrounded by a branch of laurel on the right and by a branch of oak on the left.\n\nThe following bodies and units are entitled to the use of coat of arms:\n\nThe coats of arms of the flag officers consist of the shield of the body or unit they command, replacing the naval crown for a helmet with a crest. The heraldic rank insignia of the officer (consisting of one or two anchors) is placed under the shield.\n\nThe commands and the units of the Portuguese Navy are also entitled to the use of heraldic flags, that - depending on the type of unit - can be in the form of a standard, a guidon or a pennon.\n\nAn item of naval heraldry in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) is referred to as a \"ship's badge\", although the incorrect \"ship's crest\" is sometimes used. Initially, the badges were designed and assigned to ships by the Royal Navy. After World War II, an Australian body, the Badges, Names and Honours Committee, was created to take responsibility for creating RAN ships' badges. At the first meeting, it was decided that all RAN badges would follow the Royal Navy format: a circle of rope in which the individual design would be placed, capped by a naval crown and a scroll with the ship's name. A second, longer scroll was located below the rope circle for the ship's motto. To identify the ship as Australian, the badge included a boomerang between the rope circle and motto scroll. The design was revised soon after to also incorporate a nulla nulla and a stone axe, intertwined with the boomerang.\n\nInitially, there were gaps between the naval crown, name scroll, and rope circle. The name and motto scrolls were intended to be light blue with black lettering, although in practice they were painted dark blue, making the text hard to read. In 1964, the gaps between the crown, scroll, and circle were closed up, and the scrolls were changed to black with gold edging and lettering. The lettering style was also simplified. In 1970, a minor change was made to the naval crown, with one of the pennants on top of the sails altered to point left instead of right. Another minor change was made to the crown in 1974, with the curvature of the sails altered. In 1975, the weapons below the rope circle were reorganised so the nulla nulla and axe were superimposed over the boomerang, and were redrawn slightly: one of the major changes being thicker hafts on the crossed weapons.\n\nShip's badges are used equally by the RAN for ships, shore establishments, and organisations within the RAN. The standard badge measures , with the rope circle having a diameter of from the outside edge and from the inside edge. \"Boat's badges\" were created for small craft belonging to a ship: the weapons and motto are omitted. Boat's badges are either or in diameter. Following the introduction of \"Attack\" class patrol boats and \"Oberon\" class submarines into the RAN fleet in the early 1960s, a scaled-down badge design was created for all commissioned ships of less than in length and all submarines, measuring but with no other modifications. For the patrol boats, it was decided that a full-size badge was not appropriate for such small ships. The reduced size for submarines was a practical necessity: the badge had to fit through the external hatch, as it was only displayed on the fin while in port.\nFor non-commissioned units and establishments, an altered badge design was used. The first establishment to wear a non-commissioned badge was the RAN/RAAF Australian Joint Anti-Submarine School (AJASS) in 1967. Being a joint unit, it was decided that the badge design would be based on the RAAF unit badge, with a double circle of gold rope surrounding the collar on which the unit name was written, but with an alteration in colouring to the black and gold system used on the scrolls of ships' badges. The royal crown was used instead of the naval crown. The badge entered use with all non-commissioned RAN units, such as the dockyards, naval police, and administrative divisions. In 1979, all of the altered badges (excluding the joint-operated AJASS) were changed from the royal crown to the naval crown.\n\nShips in the Royal Canadian Navy receive badges, specifically designed for each ship. Using a circular design, they are topped with the naval crown and surrounded by a gold rope. Three maple leaves at the bottom of the rope circle distinguish Canadian badges from those of other Commonwealth navies.\n\nDuring World War II, the number of ships being built and commissioned outstripped the ability of a central authority to design and approve. Local authority to the commanding officers of the ships resulted in humorous and risque badges, including some cartoon characters. These badges are not considered to be official.\n\nCurrently, all badges are reviewed by the Director of Ceremonial and recommended to the Governor General.\n\nCFB Esquimalt Naval & Military Museum has an extensive collection of official Canadian naval ship, naval establishments and naval air unit badges 1910-1948. Lieutenant-Commander (Ret'd) David J. Freeman heads the Badge Project, capturing photographic or digital images of all the badges worn by HMC ships before 1948, and is in the process of completing a book on this subject.\n\nIt is customary for each individual ship and other units in the Royal Norwegian Navy to receive an individually designed coat of arms. These coats of arms follow the Norwegian heraldic tradition of being very simple in design. They often feature only one colour, one metal and one motive. They all have the same shield shape and are surrounded by a rope. The shield is surmounted by the heraldic Crown of Norway atop the ship's name.\n\nThe design of the individual shield is often inspired by connections the ship name gives. HNoMS \"Fridtjof Nansen\" is given a shield inspired by the family coat of arms of the Nansen family. Others are given shields based on the unit's function. The Naval Schools have a shield depicting a golden anchor and two silver torches of wisdom. All naval coats of arms have to be approved by the King of Norway.\n\nDuring the Age of Sail, ships were identified by figureheads and gilded carvings. However, the extravagance of these decorations began to reach the point of flamboyance, and an Admiralty directive in the early 18th century restricted the amount that could be spent, and eventually banned it outright.\n\nShips' badges first appeared in the 1850s, as identification markings on the stationery used by some Royal Navy ships. These marks were quickly used to mark the boats assigned to a ship, to aid crew in finding their boat at a dark or crowded wharf. The creation of badges was haphazard, and eventually came into use for the ships themselves. In 1918, Charles ffoulkes, the curator of the newly established Imperial War Museum was asked by the commanding officer of HMS \"Tower\" to design a badge for his ship. He quickly received requests to create badges for other Royal Navy vessels, and on 10 December 1918, ffoulkes was appointed the Admiralty advisor on heraldry. Shortly prior to this, a Ships' Badge Committee had been established to regulate the creation and use of ships' badges.\n\nIn 1919 the badges were standardized as four shapes: Circular (Battleships & Battle Cruisers), Pentagonal (Cruisers), Shield (Destroyers) and Diamond (all other types and shore establishments).\n\nTesting was carried out to ensure that the badges were designed appropriately to identify ships. Cardboard mockups were created, gilded, and installed on a police launch, which was observed on patrol of the Thames by a captured German submarine moored outside Westminster Palace. It was decided to use different shapes to identify different types of vessel: circles for battleships, pentagons for cruisers, 'U'-shaped shields for destroyers, and diamonds for auxiliary units, including depot ships, small war vessels, and aircraft carriers.\n\nIn 1940, the designs for all ships were standardised to a circular design. This was primarily due to wartime shortages, although another factor was to eliminate difficulties caused when a ship was commissioned with a previously-used name but was a different type of vessel, requiring the badge to be redesigned for the new shape. At the same time, the use of scaled-down badges for a ship's boats was suspended, and as of 2000 has not been resumed. After the war, the pentagonal badge shape was assigned to Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels, and the diamond to commissioned shore bases. Before World War II, the design of badges for ships in other Commonwealth navies was the responsibility of the Royal Navy Ships' Badge Committee, but this responsibility was assigned to the relevant nations after the war.\n\nShips' badges are reused along with the ship name. When the Queen approves the name of a new ship she will also approve the new ship's badge, which may have changed if the shape needs to change.\n\nHMS \"Chatham\" was a ship serving in the Royal Navy with an original badge, since none of the previous \"Chatham\"s bore a badge.\n\nA few ships of the South African Navy adopted badges during World War II, but they appear to have been unofficial. Only one, that of the reserve base HMSAS \"Unitie\", conformed to the Royal Navy pattern of enclosing the badge in a 'U'-shaped frame of golden cable, ensigned of a naval crown resting on a name plaque.\n\nBadges were formalised after the war, the Royal Navy model being followed. At first, badges were diamond-shaped, but after a few years they were changed to circular frames. \"Unitie\" retained her shield-shaped badge, and in the 1980s, pentagonal badges were introduced for Navy Headquarters and the headquarters of the regional commands. The naval crown was replaced by the red lion crest of the national coat of arms in 1954, and this in turn was replaced by the secretary-bird crest of the new national arms in 2002.\n\nWhere ships and shore units are named after provinces and towns, their badges incorporate elements of the provincial or civic arms, for example the ox-wagon in the badge of the frigate SAS \"Transvaal\". Those named after historical personalities incorporate their namesakes' personal coats of arms, or elements of their arms, in their badges, for example the shield of the Van Riebeeck arms in the badge of the destroyer SAS \"Jan van Riebeeck\". For some categories of ships, including the \"Daphné\"-class submarines, Minister-class strike craft, and River-class minehunters, standard badges were designed, which were then differenced to identify individual vessels. The submarines' badges depicted a trident (emblem of the submarine branch) surmounted by a lozenge displaying the arms of the lady after whom the vessel was named. The strike craft badges depict a Viking longboat in full sail, with elements of the arms of the cabinet minister after which the ship was named on the sail. The minehunters' badges depict a bridge across a river, with an additional device above the bridge alluding to the name of the river.\n\nBadges are designed and approved by the South African National Defence Force's heraldry section, and registered at the Bureau of Heraldry to provide legal protection against misuse.\n\nIt is the custom in the United States Navy (USN) for ships, bases and other commands to receive an individually designed heraldic emblem. Due to heraldic traditions in the U.S., these emblems usually take the form of \"seals\" or \"crests\"; the terms are used often interchangeably, although the emblems are different. These items of naval heraldry are most commonly found on uniform patches for the ship's crew; unlike ships in Commonwealth navies, which display their symbols on plaques and battle honor boards fixed to the superstructure of the ship, USN ships are not allowed to paint or otherwise fix the ship's heraldry to the exterior of the ship.\n\nFrom World War I to the beginning of World War II, some U.S. Navy ships had these insignia, but World War II brought them into general use. Some designs were created by the ship's personnel, while others were commissioned by professional artists. The Korean War saw another upsurge in interest in crests and coats of arms. In the 1950s and 1960s, OPNAVINST 5030.2B encouraged ships to design their own crests, and laid out the procedure for receiving official approval.\n\nToday, the prospective commanding officers of new ships are responsible for designing the crests and submitting them for approval. They have great leeway in determining the design, and may optionally use the services of the U.S. Army's heraldry branch. Seals for destroyers tend to be oval in shape, whereas seals for submarines and aircraft carriers tend to be circular. Littoral combat ship and aircraft carrier crests also tend to feature a profile illustration of the ship on the crest, whereas destroyer crests do not.\n\n\n"}

The Palestine poster genre is more than a century old and growing. The Palestine Poster Project Archives continues to expand as the largest online collection of such posters.\n\nA majority of the works included in this archives are created by Palestinian artists, although the collection also features many works created by international, Zionist, and Israeli artists. More than 8,600 posters created by at least 1,750 artists are currently available on the Palestine Poster Project Archives’ website for public viewing.\n\nAs a Peace Corps volunteer in Morocco during the 1970s, Dan Walsh began a lifelong hobby of collecting Palestinian posters, the majority of which dealt with the theme of nationalism. Walsh initially received support from Dr. Edward Said through the American Palestine Education Foundation to transform his hobby into a public archive. In the early 2000s, Walsh founded the Palestine Poster Project Archives, an online public database that is frequently updated. He continues to avidly collect, document, and archive Palestinian posters from across the world today.\n\nThe Palestine Poster Project Archives was a key component of Walsh’s thesis as a student in Georgetown University’s Master of Arts in Arab Studies program at the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies. This database was originally created for historians, educators, and advocates of public diplomacy.\n\nThe Palestine poster genre dates back to the late nineteenth century. The Palestine Poster Project Archives entails that a poster with any of the following elements can be classified as a \"Palestine poster\":\n\n\nSome of the earliest posters produced about Palestine were made by tourist companies in the late nineteenth century. In the 1890s, Zionist groups started making posters encouraging Jewish groups to immigrate to historic Palestine and urging international support for a Jewish state. In 1897, at the First Zionist Congress in Switzerland, attendants decided to adopt poster production as a significant resource to communicate and disseminate information. Intense production of Zionist posters continued for about fifty years, after which it waned.\n\nWhen Palestinians experienced mass dislocation and exile in 1948, a series of events referred to as the 1948 Palestinian exodus, known in Arabic as \"al-Nakba\" (\"the Catastrophe\"), some prominent artists in Egypt, Syria, and other Arab countries began producing posters to convey support for a Palestinian state. According to Dan Walsh, founder of the Palestinian Poster Project Archives, as a result of the Battle of Karameh (Jordan) in 1968, the Palestine Liberation Organization began to more seriously consider the importance of international solidarity and information production and dissemination.\n\nThe PLO supported a particular style of Palestinian visual arts, leading to the rise of pamphleteer art and nationalist paintings that employed iconic imagery, symbols, and slogans for the Palestinian struggle. The Palestinian poster was seen as an especially useful medium for generating solidarity, representing narratives, and even mediating internal disagreements in Palestinian society. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, the production of Palestinian nationalist posters was prolific.\n\nUntil the 1990s, there were few major professional institutions or gallery spaces available to display work in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Therefore, artists often hung their posters in schools, town halls, union offices, public libraries, and other shared public spaces. Artist Marc Rudin explained, \"The posters had to be designed to be posted in the refugee camps, in its narrow alleys, in Palestinian homes. But they were also to be used for information campaigns abroad\". Artists designed their posters to be aesthetically pleasing, meaningful, and in many cases, communicative for both the Palestinian public and an international audience. Many Palestinian nationalist posters were displayed not only in public spaces in Palestinian towns and cities, but also in major urban spaces and capital cities throughout the Arab world and Europe.\n\nDocumentation of the Palestinian nationalist posters genre's evolution was fragmented, and at times violently interrupted, in the mid and late twentieth century. Ezzedin Kalak, the PLO's representative in France, was collecting hundreds of posters and postcards for a book about the significance of Palestinian posters when he was assassinated by the Israeli national intelligence agency (Mossad) in 1978. Kalak's project was never completed or published.\n\nPalestine poster artists continue to contribute works to the ever-growing genre today. The majority of posters displayed in the Palestine Poster Project Archives are originally printed on paper. From the 1960s to the mid-1990s, most Palestine posters were printed in a single location and then distributed worldwide. Increased internet access in the Arab world and globally, in tandem with rising costs for print production en masse, has led many Palestine poster artists to localize printing operations rather than utilize large and centralized printing companies. An increasing number of new Palestine posters are being created digitally and then printed and distributed locally.\n\nThe PPPA works are organized under various subcategories to ease a user's search. The \"Special Categories\" include a section entitled \"Artists and Collectives\" where some of the most prolific artists' works are gathered. Other sections under \"Special Categories\" include \"Exhibits and Catalogs;\" \"Historical Figures and Themes;\" \"Political, Cultural, and Social Publishers;\" and \"Museums, Libraries, Private Collections, Universities, and Archives.\"\n\nThe PPPA also has a section entitled \"Iconography\" under which 40 types of reoccurring imagery, symbols, and representation are categorized. Some of these categories include \"woman/female,\" \"stone,\" \"Palestinian flag,\" and \"olives/trees/branches.\"\n\nAccording to Walsh, works featured in the Palestine Poster Project Archives can be divided into four major “wellsprings” or origins: Israeli and Zionist artists and agencies, Palestinian nationalist artists and agencies, Muslim and Arab artists and agencies, and international artists and agencies.\n\nSome artists featured in the Palestine Poster Project Archives are not Palestinian, Jewish, or Israeli by origin. The Palestine Poster Project Archives currently holds posters made by artists from more than 55 countries. For example, Marc Rudin, a Swiss-born artist with no Arab or Palestinian ancestry, worked as a graphic artist for the PLO between 1980 and 1991. During that time, he went by the pseudonym Jihad Mansour. Rudin produced nearly 200 posters about Palestine and worked most closely with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) in Syria, Lebanon, and the West Bank. \n\nSome Palestinian poster artists are Arab by descent, but not Palestinian. For instance, artist Burhan Karkoutly was Syrian by birth and created numerous posters for the PLO during the 1970s. Due to his commitment to and understanding of the Palestinian cause, Karkoutly was considered as one of the leading “Palestinian artists” of his era.\n\nDan Walsh, the founder of the Palestine Poster Project Archives, originally envisioned that the archive would be useful for American high school educators teaching the history of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The archives could be incorporated into curricula for visual anthropology, art history, media studies, graphic design, and a variety of other subjects. Dan Walsh said in an interview with Al-Akhbar English: \"There are two narratives presented at my website, the Palestinian nationalist and the political Zionist, and they've never been put together like this before.\"\n\nThe Palestine Poster Project Archives provides some context about the production of each poster, which typically includes the date that it was printed, the organization for which it was commissioned, and the artist's name. Sometimes information about the poster’s dimensions (size) and medium are also included. Many of the posters with Arabic and Hebrew text have been translated into English.\n\nIn June 2012, the Palestinian American Research Center (PARC) sponsored Dan Walsh to present the Palestine Poster Project Archives in cities across the West Bank. This was the first time that the Palestine Poster Project Archives was formally presented in Palestine, although Walsh has made several media appearances and delivered lectures to promote the PPPA at various locations in the United States.\n\nWalsh presented the Palestine Poster Project Archives at the following venues and locations during his 2012 tour:\n\n"}
{"id": "24533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24533", "title": "Pastel", "text": "Pastel\n\nA pastel (, ) is an art medium in the form of a stick, consisting of pure powdered pigment and a binder. The pigments used in pastels are the same as those used to produce all colored art media, including oil paints; the binder is of a neutral hue and low saturation. The color effect of pastels is closer to the natural dry pigments than that of any other process.\n\nPastels have been used by artists since the Renaissance, and gained considerable popularity in the 18th century, when a number of notable artists made pastel their primary medium.\n\nAn artwork made using pastels is called a pastel (or a pastel drawing or pastel painting). \"Pastel\" used as a verb means to produce an artwork with pastels; as an adjective it means pale in color.\n\nPastel sticks or crayons consist of pure powdered pigment combined with a binder. The exact composition and characteristics of an individual pastel stick depends on the type of pastel and the type and amount of binder used. It also varies by individual manufacturer.\n\nDry pastels have historically used binders such as gum arabic and gum tragacanth. Methyl cellulose was introduced as a binder in the twentieth century. Often a chalk or gypsum component is present. They are available in varying degrees of hardness, the softer varieties being wrapped in paper. Some pastel brands use pumice in the binder to abrade the paper and create more tooth.\n\nDry pastel media can be subdivided as follows:\nIn addition, pastels using a different approach to manufacture have been developed:\n\nThere has been some debate within art societies as to what exactly counts as a pastel. The Pastel Society within the UK (the oldest pastel society) states the following are acceptable media for its exhibitions: \"\"Pastels, including Oil pastel, Charcoal, Pencil, Conté, Sanguine, or any dry media\".\" The emphasis appears to be on \"dry media\" but the debate continues.\n\nIn order to create hard and soft pastels, pigments are ground into a paste with water and a gum binder and then rolled or pressed into sticks. The name \"pastel\" comes from Medieval Latin \"pastellum\", woad paste, from Late Latin \"pastellus\", paste. The French word \"pastel\" first appeared in 1662.\n\nMost brands produce gradations of a color, the original pigment of which tends to be dark, from pure pigment to near-white by mixing in differing quantities of chalk. This mixing of pigments with chalks is the origin of the word \"pastel\" in reference to \"pale color\" as it is commonly used in cosmetic and fashion venues.\n\nA pastel is made by letting the sticks move over an abrasive ground, leaving color on the grain of the paper, sandboard, canvas etc. When fully covered with pastel, the work is called a pastel \"painting\"; when not, a pastel \"sketch\" or \"drawing\". Pastel paintings, being made with a medium that has the highest pigment concentration of all, reflect light without darkening refraction, allowing for very saturated colors.\n\nPastel supports need to provide a \"tooth\" for the pastel to adhere and hold the pigment in place. Supports include:\n\n\nPastels can be used to produce a permanent work of art if the artist meets appropriate archival considerations. This means:\n\n\nFor these reasons, some pastelists avoid the use of a fixative except in cases where the pastel has been overworked so much that the surface will no longer hold any more pastel. The fixative will restore the \"tooth\" and more pastel can be applied on top. It is the tooth of the painting surface that holds the pastels, not a fixative. Abrasive supports avoid or minimize the need to apply further fixative in this way. SpectraFix, a modern casein fixative available premixed in a pump misting bottle or as concentrate to be mixed with alcohol, is not toxic and does not darken or dull pastel colors. However, SpectraFix takes some practice to use because it's applied with a pump misting bottle instead of an aerosol spray can. It is easy to use too much SpectraFix and leave puddles of liquid that may dissolve passages of color; also it takes a little longer to dry than conventional spray fixatives between light layers.\n\nGlassine (paper) is used by artists to protect artwork which is being stored or transported. Some good quality books of pastel papers also include glassine to separate pages.\n\nPastel techniques can be challenging since the medium is mixed and blended directly on the working surface, and unlike paint, colors cannot be tested on a palette before applying to the surface. Pastel errors cannot be covered the way a paint error can be painted out. Experimentation with the pastel medium on a small scale in order to learn various techniques gives the user a better command over a larger composition.\n\nPastels have some techniques in common with painting, such as blending, masking, building up layers of color, adding accents and highlighting, and shading. Some techniques are characteristic of both pastels and sketching mediums such as charcoal and lead, for example, hatching and crosshatching, and gradation. Other techniques are particular to the pastel medium.\n\n\nPastels are a dry medium and produce a great deal of dust, which can cause respiratory irritation. More seriously, pastels use the same pigments as artists' paints, many of which are toxic. For example, exposure to cadmium pigments, which are common and popular bright yellows, oranges, and reds, can lead to cadmium poisoning. Pastel artists, who use the pigments without a strong painting binder, are especially susceptible to such poisoning. For this reason, many modern pastels are made using substitutions for cadmium, chromium, and other toxic pigments, while retaining the traditional pigment names.\n\nThe manufacture of pastels originated in the 15th century. The pastel medium was mentioned by Leonardo da Vinci, who learned of it from the French artist Jean Perréal after that artist's arrival in Milan in 1499. Pastel was sometimes used as a medium for preparatory studies by 16th-century artists, notably Federico Barocci. The first French artist to specialize in pastel portraits was Joseph Vivien.\n\nDuring the 18th century the medium became fashionable for portrait painting, sometimes in a mixed technique with gouache. Pastel was an important medium for artists such as Jean-Baptiste Perronneau, Maurice Quentin de La Tour (who never painted in oils), and Rosalba Carriera. The pastel still life paintings and portraits of Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin are much admired, as are the works of the Swiss-French artist Jean-Étienne Liotard. In 18th-century England the outstanding practitioner was John Russell. In Colonial America, John Singleton Copley used pastel occasionally for portraits.\n\nIn France, pastel briefly became unpopular during and after the Revolution, as the medium was identified with the frivolity of the Ancien Régime. By the mid-19th century, French artists such as Eugène Delacroix and especially Jean-François Millet were again making significant use of pastel. Their countryman Édouard Manet painted a number of portraits in pastel on canvas, an unconventional ground for the medium. Edgar Degas was an innovator in pastel technique, and used it with an almost expressionist vigor after about 1885, when it became his primary medium. Odilon Redon produced a large body of works in pastel.\n\nJames Abbott McNeill Whistler produced a quantity of pastels around 1880, including a body of work relating to Venice, and this probably contributed to a growing enthusiasm for the medium in the United States. In particular, he demonstrated how few strokes were required to evoke a place or an atmosphere. Mary Cassatt, an American artist active in France, introduced the Impressionists and pastel to her friends in Philadelphia and Washington.\n\nAccording to the Metropolitan Museum of Art's \"Time Line of Art History: Nineteenth Century American Drawings\": \n\nOn the East Coast of the United States, the Society of Painters in Pastel was founded in 1883 by William Merritt Chase, Robert Blum, and others. The Pastellists, led by Leon Dabo, was organized in New York in late 1910 and included among its ranks Everett Shinn and Arthur Bowen Davies. On the American West Coast the influential artist and teacher Pedro Joseph de Lemos, who served as Chief Administrator of the San Francisco Art Institute and Director of the Stanford University Museum and Art Gallery, popularized pastels in regional exhibitions. Beginning in 1919 de Lemos published a series of articles on “painting” with pastels, which included such notable innovations as allowing the intensity of light on the subject to determine the distinct color of laid paper and the use of special optics for making “night sketches” in both urban and rural settings. His night scenes, which were often called “dreamscapes” in the press, were influenced by French Symbolism, and especially Odilon Redon.\n\nPastels have been favored by many modern artists because of the medium's broad range of bright colors.

Barrie's character Peter Pan. It was commissioned by Barrie and made by Sir George Frampton. The original statue is displayed in Kensington Gardens in London, to the west of The Long Water, close to Barrie's former home on Bayswater Road. Barrie's stories were inspired in part by the gardens: the statue is located at the place where Peter Pan lands in Barrie's book \"The Little White Bird\" after flying out of his nursery. Six other casts made by the original artist have been erected in other locations around the world.\n\nThe sculpture stands about high. It has a tall conical form, like a tree stump, topped by a young boy, approximately life size for an eight year old, wearing a nightshirt and blowing a thin musical instrument like a trumpet or flute, sometimes interpreted as pan pipes. The sides of the stump are decorated with small figures of squirrels, rabbits, mice, and fairies. Barrie had intended the boy to be based on a photograph of Michael Llewelyn Davies wearing a Peter Pan costume, but Frampton chose another model, possibly James W. Shaw or William A. Harwood.\n\nA completed plaster model of the work was exhibited at the Royal Academy in May 1911. Barrie had the original bronze erected in London on 30 April 1912, without fanfare and without permission, so that it might appear to children that the fairies had put it in place overnight. He published a notice in \"The Times\" newspaper the following day, 1 May: \"There is a surprise in store for the children who go to Kensington Gardens to feed the ducks in the Serpentine this morning. Down by the little bay on the south-western side of the tail of the Serpentine they will find a May-day gift by Mr J.M. Barrie, a figure of Peter Pan blowing his pipe on the stump of a tree, with fairies and mice and squirrels all around. It is the work of Sir George Frampton, and the bronze figure of the boy who would never grow up is delightfully conceived.\" \n\nHe donated the sculpture to the city of London, although some critics objected to him advertising his works by erecting a sculpture in a public park without permission. It became a Grade II* listed building in 1970. A plaque was unveiled by Princess Margaret in 1997.\n\nFrampton made a series of small bronze reproductions of the Pan figure from 1913 to his death in 1928. Examples were sold at Bonham's in March and November 2015, and one was sold in Scotland in 2016 for £60,000.\n\nFrampton made six other full-size casts from the original moulds, which are situated in:\n\nThe memorial to George Frampton in the Crypt of St Paul's Cathedral sculpted by Edward Gillick in 1930 depicts a young child holding in his hand a miniature replica of his statue of Peter Pan.\n\nOther sculptors have created statues of Peter Pan, including two by Alistair Smart near the birthplace of J. M. Barrie in Kirriemuir in Scotland; Charles Andrew Hafner's 1928 sculpture in Carl Schurz Park in New York City; Ivan Mitford-Barberton's sculpture given to the Red Cross Children's Hospital in Cape Town in 1959; Cecil Thomas's 1965 sculpture in Dunedin Botanic Garden, and Diarmuid Byron O'Connor's 2000 sculpture at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London.\n\n\n\n"}

The company name combines the Italian word for armchair, \"Poltrona\" and \"Frau,\" the last name of its founder.\n\nNoted for their exhaustive quality standards, the company uses a 21-step leather tanning process (vs. industry standard ranging from 12-15 steps) where the full-grain leather is dyed through, so a surface scratch won’t reveal a lining underneath. 95% of the company's products are made by hand.\n\nIn 2004, Poltrona Frau acquired noted Italian furniture company Cappellini, and the Poltrona Frau Group now includes brands Poltrona Frau, Cappellini, Cassina, Alias, Nemo Lighting, Ceramica Flaminia and Fish Design. In 2014, United States-based Haworth Group purchased a controlling interest in Poltrona Frau.\n\nAs of early 2014, the company operates 70 brand stores in 65 countries.\n\nNoted for their catalogue of iconic furniture designs, including the 1930 \"Vanity Fair\" armchair and the \"Dezza\" armchair designed by Gio Ponti in 1963, Poltrona Frau seating was used for the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles CA.\n\nIn 2006, the company marketed a knock down version of its Viking chair at their SoHo, New York store, packing the pieces in a single easy-to-carry white gift box with an orange ribbon, requiring only the use of an included allen wrench to assemble the piece.\n\nBeginning in 2011, the company marketed a $13,000 sofa designed by French architect and designer Jean-Marie Massaud — called the \"John-John\" sofa, in tribute to John F. Kennedy, Jr. — followed in 2012 by the John-John bed. In 2013, the company designed and manufactured 600 seats for the Arena Corinthians in São Paulo, Brazil, the first time the company produced seats for a football stadium.\n\nIn addition to designing seating for yachts, airplanes and helicopters, Poltrona Frau has designed leather interiors for automobiles since 1988, when Lancia asked the company to design and manufacture interiors for their new version 8.32 Thema model. Poltrona Frau has since made interiors from automotive companies ranging from Alfa Romeo, Lancia, Ferrari and Maserati to Mini, Fiat, Infiniti and Chrysler.\n\nIn 2002 the company's leathersmiths created red leather seating and pillions for a special edition of the California model of noted Italian motorcycle manufacturer Moto Guzzi, in celebration of the company's 80th anniversary.\n\nTo mark its centennial in 2012, the company opened the Poltrona Frau Museum, designed by Italian architect Michele De Lucchi, formerly of the Memphis Group, at the company's headquarters and production facility in Tolentino.\n\nThe museum features approximately sixty of the company's emblematic furniture pieces, many from the collection of board chairman Franco Moschini, and organizes the company's history and production with examples of furniture, drawings, images and manufacturing materials in a 1400 square meter building under the theme “l’intelligenza delle mani,\" which translates \"intelligence of the hands,\" or roughly \"manual know-how\".\n\nA primary video gallery highlights a technical glossary of the company: nine hand tools, methods and materials — including the curved needle, nails, horsehair, quilting and the hammer — the tools and materials required to fold, stitch, attach and work leather.\n\n"}

It was commissioned by the Spanish Prime Minister Manuel Godoy to commemorate his victory in the brief War of the Oranges against Portugal.\n\nThe portrait is an incisive psychological characterisation. The subject's self belief is depicted via his unusual reclining posture, the surrounding horses, and the phallic baton situated between his legs. The painting metaphorically places Godoy sitting at the apex of the Spanish government. The artist captures Godoy's arrogance through his posture, and the inclusion of Portuguese flags. The choice of lighting gives intensity to the piece.\n\nIn 1801 Godoy was the height of his power, having won in the War of the Oranges he was now Generalissimo of \"land and sea\" and \"Prince of Peace\"; pompous titles he willingly accepted. He and Goya were friends, Godoy owned two of the artist's portraits of Majas, which he may have commissioned. He was close to and held influence over the Charles IV of Spain's wife, Maria Luisa of Parma, and married into the royal family via the Countess of Chinchon, a cousin of the king. Goya had earlier portrayed Godoy in 1794 when he was Duke of Alcudia, with a small equestrian portrait. His career ended in disgrace and after the Spanish War of Independence, after which he was banished to live in poverty. He died in exile in Paris in 1851. Despite his fall he continued to speak favourably for the artist, and in his memoirs referred to Goya's \"Caprichos\" with extreme favour, as if he himself had seen them published.\n\n"}

This was commonly done in the past. However, in the late 20th century a separate concept of conservation-restoration was developed that is more concerned with preserving the work of art for the future, and less with making it look pristine. Restoration is controversial, since it often involves some irreversible change to the original material of the artwork with the goal of making it \"look good.\" The attitude that has developed in recent years with the development of conservation is to attempt to make all restoration reversible.\n\nArt conservation can involve the cleaning and stabilization of art work. Ideally, any process used is reversible, departures from that ideal not being undertaken lightly. Cleaning is not a reversible process and can sometimes be controversial due to fears that cleaning would damage a piece, or on the grounds that damage or residue forms part of the history of a given piece and should not be modified. Michelangelo's statue of David has undergone two cleanings to remove dirt that had accumulated on the statue's surface.\n\nArt restoration is vital to the survival of classical paintings and is part of the scientific application of chemistry. It often involves research to determine the original colors and materials of a work.\n\nThe use of watercolor paints to inpaint damages on fresco is an example of a technique utilized to achieve almost complete reversibility. This is the technique used in the 20 year restoration of Da Vinci's \"The Last Supper\" in Milan. One of the most popular inpainting techniques used today is the Tinted Varnish Treatment. This process is done once the piece is fully cleaned and varnished. This last step in the restoration process is to then go into spots where original paint may be missing, or where patched holes and other irregularities may lie. The restorer then goes in with tinted varnish over the top of the non-tinted varnish. This gives the illusion that the spots have been \"re-painted\", while in fact it is just a spot of tinted varnish. Most commonly \"stippling\" is used while using tinted varnish, in order for light to reflect similar to paint. This is done by using tiny dots in a row for variance.\n\nIn 2014, Harvard Art Museums exhibited murals by Mark Rothko from 1961 and 1962 which had faded due to their original display in a dining room. It restored the works to their original appearance by digitally projecting light carefully calibrated at each pixel from a photograph of the original colors, which made up the difference between the current and original appearance without damaging the material.\n\n\n"}

The trade applies to all kinds of outlets from small corner shops to hypermarkets. A shop fitter executes planning, designs shop layout and installs equipment and services. A shop fitting firm typically incorporates professional expertise in interior design, manufacturing of bespoke furniture, signage and fittings (with own or outsourced facilities) and purchasing of retail equipment.\n\nA shop fitting cycle begins with a survey and measurement of available space and preparing design drawings for submission to the client. Alternatively, the client may have their own drawings prepared by an independent interior designer. The shop fitter arranges for purchase of standard equipment and merchandise or production of bespoke furniture, delivers and physically installs them—until the shop is ready for daily operation.\n\nThere are different requirements to the different branches and types of shop. Fashion shop design requires up-to-the-minute awareness of current trends in colour and style to create stores that will draw customers in.\n\n\"'Shopfitting system\"' refers to a product range made to satisfy the needs of shopfitters and ultimately retailers for display and merchandising goods. A shopfitting system can be adapted from combinations of standardized components for a particular retail application. A manufacturer would normally launch new shopfitting systems on a 2-year basis. Leading manufacturers would offer design oriented systems, followers would reinterpret them making the display solution achievable with as many as existing items as possible, hoping that retailers will choose their product because of the cheap price.\n\nShopfitting systems are usually connected to a \"modular\" concept, meaning that each item has more than one use. This economically goes into the rules of \"network\", where one element has the value of three, if added to another element, because 1x1=1 but 2x2=4: an extra item designed and compatible with others, has very high value.\n\nShop Fitting is a profession that involves the fitting of retail outlets like corner shops, department stores, convenience stores, supermarkets and hypermarkets with equipment, fixtures and fittings. It’s carried out by a shop fitter who executes all planning, design, layout and installation of equipment and services. A shop fitter brings interior design expertise and assists in the design of bespoke furniture, fittings and signage and also with the buying of retail equipment.\n\nThe process begins with a survey of the retail premises and measurement of available space. The next stage is the preparation of design, which is then submitted to the client for review and approval. Some clients provide their own design drawings that are prepared by another interior designer. Finally, the shop fitter arranges for the purchase of standard equipment and the production of the bespoke furniture, which is delivered and installed – ready for the shop operation. \n\nShop fitting is a precision orientated profession that requires intricacy and exceptional attention to detail in order to meet client requirements.

{"id": "3614264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3614264", "title": "Skadarlija", "text": "Skadarlija\n\nSkadarlija () is a vintage street, an urban neighborhood and former municipality of Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. It is located in the Belgrade municipality of Stari Grad (Old town) and generally considered the main bohemian quarter of Belgrade, similar to Paris' Montmartre. After Kalemegdan, Skadarlija is the second most visited tourist attraction in Belgrade, contributing to one third of the city's foreign currency income.\n\nSkadarlija is located less than north-west of Terazije, central Belgrade. It begins right below the Republic Square and stretches along the short, winding Skadarska Street. One of the most famous streets in Belgrade, it is less than long. It connects the Despot Stefan Boulevard with the Dušanova Street, near the Bajloni open greenmarket and the Mira Trailović Square, where it extends into the neighborhood of Dorćol.\n\nThough today the term is mostly applied to the street only, Skadarlija is a former municipality of Belgrade and a wider quarter which includes some 20 neighboring streets.\n\nSkadarlija became a separate municipality of Belgrade in 1952, after the previous post-World War II division of Belgrade into raions from 1945 to 1952 ended. That municipality included a large portion of urban Belgrade, mainly the Danube oriented neighborhoods like Dorćol, Jalija, Stari Grad, etc. By the 1953 census, municipality of Skadarlija had a population of 31,281. On 1 January 1957 it merged into the new municipality of Stari Grad and Skadarlija became a \"local community\" (\"mesna zajednica\"), sub-municipal administrative unit, within the municipality. According to the censuses, the local community of Skadarlija had a population of 7,399 in 1981, 7,074 in 1991 and 5,942 in 2002. Municipality of Stari Grad later abolished local communities.\n\nThe history of Skadarlija began in 1830 with the settlement of Gypsies in the abandoned trenches in front of the ramparts. The 1854 town plan of Belgrade reveals that the Gypsy hovels had been replaced by brick buildings into which artisans, caterers, petty clerks and others moved. The whole locality was referred to as the \"Gypsy Quarter\", \"Gypsy Alley\" or \"Šićan Mala\" and remained a Romani settlement until 1870. In that period, the stream called \"Bibijin potok\" (\"Bibija stream\"), which originates under the modern Politika building in the \"Makedonska\" street, flowed down the alley, crossing it. The stream was named after Bibija, the Romani deity of salvation. At the time, Belgrade was divided into quarters, and the stream was an administrative border between the quarters of Palilula and Dorćol (Stari Grad). As Palilula limited the playing of music to midnight, people would then jump across the stream in the Dorćol section to continue with festivities.\n\nAn aqueduct was later constructed which conducted the stream underground, which still flows below the street. The largest arch of the aqueduct was named Skadar, after the town, so in 1872 the street was named \"Skadarska ulica\". Serbian for \"Skadar street\", it is still the street's official name. As of 2018, Skadarska is among only 29 streets in Belgrade which never changed their names since the first naming of the city streets in 1872.\n\nSkadarlija began to acquire its bohemian character in the last few decades of the 19th century, and particularly after 1901, when the well-known \"Dardaneli\" inn, located where the National Museum in Belgrade is today, was demolished and its guests, prominent writers and actors, moved to the Skadarlija inns or kafanas. In the early 20the century there were 15 kafanas in Skadarlija, including: \"Tri šešira\" (\"Three Hats\"), \"Dva jelena\" (\"Two Deer\"), \"Zlatni bokal\" (\"The Golden Chalice\"), \"Bandist\", \"East\", \"Guild\", \"Vuk Karadžić\", \"Bums keler\", \"Miloš Obilić\" and \"The two Sergeants\". The first three of these still survive today, accompanied by some new restaurants like \"Ima dana\" (\"There will be days\"), \"Skadarlija\" (demolished in 2006), \"Dva bela goluba\" (\"Two White Doves\"). In the late 19the century, the beginning of the street was a location of \"Pašonin bulevar\", the very first Belgrade's music hall.\n\nThe end section of Skadarlija is known as the Skadarlija atrium. It is mostly occupied by the brewery that belonged to one of the most distinguished Belgrade families before World War II, the Czech-originating Bajloni family. It produced \"Aleksandar\" beer, made from thermal waters that spring out in the brewery's backyard. When Bajloni began digging for the foundations of his brewery in 1892, he discovered the bones of the mammoths and skulls of the Neanderthal Krapina man. The well is located 80 to 300 meters (250 to 1000 feet) under the surface. After 1945, the brewery became part of the \"BIP\" brewery, but was later closed. The spring water was bottled for drinking until the early 2000s. Under the brewery is a complex of \"lagums\" (subterranean galleries or catacombes), which were used as a storage rooms for the beer barrels. By 2008, the entire inner complex is abandoned and slated for demolition. However, as the project of massive reconstruction failed, the brewery became home for many coffeehouses and clubs.\n\nThe house of Đura Jakšić, a well-known writer and painter who lived and died in Skadarlija, has been turned into a meeting place for the poets participating in the Skadarlija Evenings event. Its renovation and restoration began in 1968 in accordance with the designs made by a group of prominent artists: architect Uglješa Bogunović (1922–94), writer and painter Zuko Džumhur (1921–89), painter Mario Maskareli (1918–96), sculptor Milica Ribnikar-Bogunović (1931), painter and writer Momo Kapor, among others. They managed to preserve its existing values and introduce modern facilities without interfering with its historical features. In the late 1960s, Skadarlija regained fame as the center of youth and bohemian artists of Belgade. Plans for further adaptations were made in 1977, but remained on paper until 2008.\n\nIn 1985 theatre director Zorica Jevremović Munitić founded Children's Street Theater /Ulično dečje pozorište/ in Skadarlija. The core of the troupe was made up of Romany children who lived in Skadarlija, 'white' children' from Dorcol (a nearby prestigious Belgrade neighborhood), Romany children from the favelas of the Belgrade suburb of Mirijevo (who sell flowers in Skadarlija), professional actors and painters who live in Skadarlija, a Skadarlija fortune-teller, clowns, fire eaters, and alternative artists (musicians, painters).\n\nThe present Skadarlija, a short and curved street, is a remarkable Belgrade tourist attraction. It includes well-known restaurants, hotels (e.g. Le Petit Piaf), art galleries, antique and souvenir shops. At the end of the street there is the \"Sebilj\" fountain. It is an ornamented drinking fountain, copy of the Sebilj fountain in Baščaršija in Sarajevo, and gift from Sarajevo to Belgrade.\n\nGroups playing Serbian brass or traditional urban music and actors dressed in traditional Serb costumes perform down the street. Unlike other similar and popular places in Belgrade that are considered posh, Skadarlija is known as a place visited by young couples and entire families with children. Restaurants offer the typical national cuisine, most notably the \"roštilj\" (grilled meat) with \"pivo\" (beer). Skadarlija's cafés, restaurants, art exhibits and cobblestone (\"kaldrma\") promenade attract up to people daily. The street is a car-free zone but it would be unsuited for traffic anyway because it is too narrow and with bumpy cobblestones.\n\nWell-known but mostly poor poets and writers became regular visitors of Skadarlija in the early 20th century, not just from Serbia but from the wider Yugoslav areas, even before the Yugoslav state was formed as such in 1918. The most prominent residents and visitors in Skadarlija's Bohemian history include Đura Jakšić, Dobrica Milutinović, Žanka Stokić, Ilija Stanojević, Tin Ujević, Gustav Krklec, Stevan Sremac, Antun Gustav Matoš, Zuko Džumhur, Momo Kapor and Silvana Armenulić.\n\nAfter decades of performing in Skadarlija's restaurants and outdoors, some singers and performers became synonymous with Skadarlija: singers Šaban Šaulić, Toma Zdravković, Olga Jančevecka, Divna Đokić, Sofka Vasiljković, Mila Matić, actress Ljubica Janićijević who impersonated Gypsy fortune-tellers, and Radomir Šobota as a drummer.\n\nRestaurants are proud of their lists of worldwide celebrities and epicurians who visited them over the decades. Even Alfred Hitchcock ended his diet in Skadarlija . Often, they post photographs of their visits on the walls. For example, over the years, \"Tri šešira\" welcomed numerous famous guests such as guitarist Jimi Hendrix, politicians George H.W. Bush, Josip Broz Tito, King Juan Carlos I of Spain, Sandro Pertini, and chess player Anatoly Karpov. Other celebrities who visited Skadarlija include queen Elizabeth II, politicians Willy Brandt, Gianni de Michelis, Helmut Kohl, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Yevgeny Primakov, Igor Ivanov and Margaret Thatcher, author Alberto Moravia, actors Burt Lancaster, Vladimir Visotsky, Gina Lollobrigida, Alain Delon, film director Nikita Mikhalkov, etc. Visitors from the later period include Joe Biden and Johannes Hahn.\n\nAs similar Bohemian quarters, Skadarlija and Parisian Montmartre twinned on 22 October 1977. A group of French artists visited Belgrade to mark the occasion. They were joined by large crowds of Belgraders, and they formed a joint procession which walked from the Monument of Gratitude to France in Kalemegdan Park, through Knez Mihailova Street and Republic Square, to Skadarlija. The photos of the event are kept in the archive of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Two identical plaques, commemorating the event, are placed in May 1978. In Montmartre, the plaque is placed on the building of the while artist Branimir Bane Minić, who authored the plaque, was dubbed the Knight of Montmartre. In Belgrade, the plaque is placed across the house of Đura Jakšić.\n\nSince 1993, the official opening of the summer season in Skadarlija (restaurants are open the entire year) has been marked by rising a \"bohemian flag\". The flagpole is located in front of the \"Zlatni bokal\" restaurant. The ceremony is always attended by celebrities, including popular and opera singers, actors, and artists. The season usually begins in the late April/early May.\n\nThere is a special code of conduct for the restaurants and their employees. The code was rescinded in 1975 but was reintroduced in 2010. It includes the types of dishes that can be found on the menues, what types of uniforms, table clothes or music are allowed and the knowledge of foreign languages.\n\nThe entire season consists of a series of festivities and celebrations: Summer Saint Nicholas Feast, Skadarlija Fest, Flower Festival (\"Festival cveća\"), Hat Fesival (\"Šeširijada\"), Tamburica Fest, Miss Skadarlija Paegeant, children's cooking festival \"Varjačići\" (visited by Jamie Oliver), wine exhibitions, painting and poetry evenings, theatrical shows, Snail Race for choosing the slowest bicycle rider, dancing shows for the old-style dances, etc.\n\nThe symbol of Skadarlija is a Fedora-type hat. There are numerous folk songs which mention the hat, they are dedicated to it or named after it. This especially goes for the songs in the style of starogradska muzika, which is another emblematic feature of Skadarlija.\n\nAt the end of the street, across the \"Dušanova\" Street, there is an open greenmarket, officially named Skadarlija Greenmarket. It developed spontaneously in the 19th century for the customers from the lower Dorćol neighborhood, for whom the central city market, the Great Market, was too distant and uphill. It was established on an empty lot in front of the Filip's Brewery, which was later renamed to Bajloni Brewery and the market became known as the Bajloni Market (\"Bajlonijeva pijaca\"). In 1926 the Great Market was finally closed and city founded several new markets throughout the city, further from the downtown: Zeleni Venac, Kalenić and Jovanova market. In the process, the Bajloni market was also adapted that year: it got new market stalls, a fence, quality stores for the meat, eggs and dairy products and improved hygiene. Though officially named Skadarlija today, the citizens refer to the market only as Bajloni.\n\nIn February 2008, plans were announced for the complete reconstruction of the lowest section of Skadarlija (Skadarlija atrium, an area of about ) bounded by the streets of \"Skadarska\", \"Zetska\", \"Cetinjska\" and \"Dušanova\". Works are scheduled to begin in September 2008 and due to be finished by December 2010. A new multi-functional center will include two hotels, subterranean garage, restaurants, museum and a new pedestrian zone comprising a wide promenade between the \"Skadarska\" and \"Cetinjska\" streets. The restaurant \"Stara Skadarlija\", two authentic walls of the brewery, the old tower and shopping mall, boiler room and \"lagums\" will be preserved but with additional functions. The tower will be illuminated and visible from the city neighborhoods below. The shopping mall's higher floors will be turned into a hotel. Lagums will be open for the public and turned into souvenir and gift shops. The atrium will be turned into a new commercial shopping mall and a hotel with subterranean garage of parking spaces. Water springs will be co-opted and protected, and new drills will be added to the existing three springs, as a sort of a tourist attraction. The most controversial aspect at the moment appears to be the concept of a glass box-shaped membrane, lit from the inside, which is supposed to engulf the \"Stara Skadarlija\" restaurant. The idea is opposed by the local population. Except for \"Stara Skadarlija\", changes will mainly occur in the side from the \"Cetinjska\" street which is considered a low preservation urban area, unlike the Skadarlija side, which is protected by the law and no new construction works will be allowed. As the altitude difference from top to bottom of the projected area is , it is \"de facto\" going to be step-like dug into the ground for almost three floors. The project was scrapped in the later years due to the unsolved property ownership issues, as the BIP sold the brewery to the Italian company \"Star Immobiliare\" in 2006 which in turn sold it to the British \"Invest Balkan Properties PLC\" in 2007. Company \"Elgin\" acquired the building in 2010. They claimed that by the end of 2011, they will announce which of the world-famous hotel chains will build a hotel but nothing happened.\n\nInstead, reconstruction of the street was announced by the city government in October 2016, as the cobblestones and the façades became damaged in time. Works were scheduled for the spring of 2017, but were moved to October 2017, as the city decided to accept the proposition of the kafana owners to postpone it until after the touristic season is over. However, they decided to renovate the drinking fountain, which was to be finished in July 2017. As the fountain is at the beginning of the street, the tourists routinely avoid the street thinking it is completely closed, while those who enter the restaurants' terraces and gardens often leave as the dust is everywhere, especially in the initial section of the street. The number of visitors dwindled and the restaurateurs accused the city administration of \"ruining the 2017 season\". The fountain was restored according to the original 1966 project of Bogunović and Ribnikar, and the works were finished on 7 July 2017, 10 days ahead of the schedule. The stone fountain, which was built on the location of an old, one-pipe fountain from the Ottoman period, was fully renovated and the stone bench made of the yellow Ljig sandstone, which was projected in 1966, was finally built. Further reconstruction began on 16 October 2017 and was projected to last until the spring of 2018.\n\nIn November 2017 photos appeared showing that the trademark stone \"kaldrma\" has been removed and that street was paved with the asphalt concrete. It prompted a major public outburst and protests, so the city authorities explained that the asphalt is just the substrate and that stones will be washed and placed on top of the asphalt. As the works were under the tougher public scrutiny since then, it was obvious that the old stone was replaced with the new, imported one, produced in Greece in 2016. City then announced that the old and new stones will be mixed, but instead of a colorful stones of the old \"kaldrma\", the new one is uniformly gray, described as the \"dark shroud, in contrast to the previous playful and diverse one, which took [from Skadarlija] its joy and vibrancy and killed its Dionysian spirit\". In the lower half, which was done by December, only the new stones were used. The customs paper show that the stone was imported only after the asphalt pavement was finished and public protests.\n\nThe reconstruction was halted again in the spring of 2018 because of the opening of the touristic season, and was continued in October 2018.\n\n"}

The results of the competition are as follows. For a full explanation of the scoring system, qualification process, awards and records, see Sweet Adelines International competition.\nQualification for the competition happens as part of the regional chorus competition. The five highest-scoring small (division A, fewer than 30 singers) and midsize (division, AA 31–60 singers) choruses across all regional competitions qualify directly for the Harmony Classic of the following year. With five choruses in each of the two divisions (A & AA) a total of 10 choruses compete in this competition each year. Only one chorus from a region may compete in each of the divisions and the previous year's winner may not compete in the same division again the following year. Furthermore, a chorus may not compete in both the main competition and also the Harmony Classic at the same year. A chorus may potentially qualify for both the main chorus competition as well as the Harmony Classic, but are only permitted to compete in one, thereby making a space available for the next highest qualifier to take their place at the other competition.\n\n\"River City Sound \"qualified in region 5 but performed as representative of region 22 due to regional boundary changes before the competition.\n\n\"Song of the Lakes\" chorus was known as \"Thumb Area\" at the regional competition and subsequently changed its name.\n\nThe official scoresheet \"incorrectly \"lists the Farminton Village score as 1216 which was their total \"before \"the bonus points were added.\n\n\"Spirit of Harmony\" and \"Queen City Sound\" both received the same total score, but Spirit of Harmony was awarded the higher place on the basis of a better score in the \"sound\" judging category.\n\n\"Springfield Metro\" qualified in region 7 but competed representing region 25 due to regional boundary changes before the competition.\n\nThe 2015 competition was held on 7 October at the MGM Grand Las Vegas.\n\nThe 2016 competition was held on 17 October at the MGM Grand Las Vegas, the first time the competition will have ever been held at the same location twice in a row.\n\nThe 2017 competition was held on October 10.

{"id": "21282070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21282070", "title": "Taste", "text": "Taste\n\nTaste, gustatory perception, or gustation is one of the five traditional senses that belongs to the gustatory system.\n\nTaste is the sensation produced when a substance in the mouth reacts chemically with taste receptor cells located on taste buds in the oral cavity, mostly on the tongue. Taste, along with smell (olfaction) and trigeminal nerve stimulation (registering texture, pain, and temperature), determines flavors of food and/or other substances. Humans have taste receptors on taste buds (gustatory calyculi) and other areas including the upper surface of the tongue and the epiglottis. The gustatory cortex is responsible for the perception of taste.\n\nThe tongue is covered with thousands of small bumps called papillae, which are visible to the naked eye. Within each papilla are hundreds of taste buds. The exception to this is the filiform papillae that do not contain taste buds. There are between 2000 and 5000 taste buds that are located on the back and front of the tongue. Others are located on the roof, sides and back of the mouth, and in the throat. Each taste bud contains 50 to 100 taste receptor cells.\n\nThe sensation of taste includes five established basic tastes: sweetness, sourness, saltiness, bitterness, and umami. Scientific experiments have demonstrated that these five tastes exist and are distinct from one another. Taste buds are able to distinguish between different tastes through detecting interaction with different molecules or ions. Sweet, savory, and bitter tastes are triggered by the binding of molecules to G protein-coupled receptors on the cell membranes of taste buds. Saltiness and sourness are perceived when alkali metal or hydrogen ions enter taste buds, respectively.\n\nThe basic tastes contribute only partially to the sensation and flavor of food in the mouth—other factors include smell, detected by the olfactory epithelium of the nose; texture, detected through a variety of mechanoreceptors, muscle nerves, etc.; temperature, detected by thermoreceptors; and \"coolness\" (such as of menthol) and \"hotness\" (pungency), through chemesthesis.\n\nAs taste senses both harmful and beneficial things, all basic tastes are classified as either aversive or appetitive, depending upon the effect the things they sense have on our bodies. Sweetness helps to identify energy-rich foods, while bitterness serves as a warning sign of poisons.\n\nAmong humans, taste perception begins to fade around 50 years of age because of loss of tongue papillae and a general decrease in saliva production. Humans can also have distortion of tastes through dysgeusia. Not all mammals share the same taste senses: some rodents can taste starch (which humans cannot), cats cannot taste sweetness, and several other carnivores including hyenas, dolphins, and sea lions, have lost the ability to sense up to four of their ancestral five taste senses.\n\nTaste in the gustatory system allows humans to distinguish between safe and harmful food, and to gauge foods’ nutritional value. Digestive enzymes in saliva begin to dissolve food into base chemicals that are washed over the papillae and detected as tastes by the taste buds. The tongue is covered with thousands of small bumps called papillae, which are visible to the naked eye. Within each papilla are hundreds of taste buds. The exception to this are the filiform papillae that do not contain taste buds. There are between 2000 and 5000 taste buds that are located on the back and front of the tongue. Others are located on the roof, sides and back of the mouth, and in the throat. Each taste bud contains 50 to 100 taste receptor cells.\n\nBitter foods are generally found unpleasant, while sour, salty, sweet, and umami tasting foods generally provide a pleasurable sensation. The five specific tastes received by taste receptors are saltiness, sweetness, bitterness, sourness, and \"savoriness\", often known by its Japanese term \"umami\" which translates to ‘delicious’. As of the early twentieth century, Western physiologists and psychologists believed there were four basic tastes: sweetness, sourness, saltiness, and bitterness. At that time, savoriness was not identified, but now a large number of authorities recognize it as the fifth taste.\n\nOne study found that both salt and sour taste mechanisms detect, in different ways, the presence of sodium chloride (salt) in the mouth, however, acids are also detected and perceived as sour. The detection of salt is important to many organisms, but specifically mammals, as it serves a critical role in ion and water homeostasis in the body. It is specifically needed in the mammalian kidney as an osmotically active compound which facilitates passive re-uptake of water into the blood. Because of this, salt elicits a pleasant taste in most humans.\n\nSour and salt tastes can be pleasant in small quantities, but in larger quantities become more and more unpleasant to taste. For sour taste this is presumably because the sour taste can signal under-ripe fruit, rotten meat, and other spoiled foods, which can be dangerous to the body because of bacteria which grow in such media. Additionally, sour taste signals acids, which can cause serious tissue damage.\n\nThe bitter taste is almost universally unpleasant to humans. This is because many nitrogenous organic molecules which have a pharmacological effect on humans taste bitter. These include caffeine, nicotine, and strychnine, which respectively compose the stimulant in coffee, addictive agent in cigarettes, and active compound in many pesticides. It appears that some psychological process allows humans to overcome their innate aversion to bitter taste, as caffeinated drinks are widely consumed and enjoyed around the world. Many common medicines have a bitter taste if chewed; the gustatory system apparently interprets these compounds as poisons. In this manner, the unpleasant reaction to the bitter taste is a last-line warning system before the compound is ingested and can do damage.\n\nSweet taste signals the presence of carbohydrates in solution. Since carbohydrates have a very high calorie count (saccharides have many bonds, therefore much energy), they are desirable to the human body, which evolved to seek out the highest calorie intake foods. They are used as direct energy (sugars) and storage of energy (glycogen). However, there are many non-carbohydrate molecules that trigger a sweet response, leading to the development of many artificial sweeteners, including saccharin, sucralose, and aspartame. It is still unclear how these substances activate the sweet receptors and what adaptational significance this has had.\n\nThe savory taste (known in Japanese as \"umami\") was identified by Japanese chemist Kikunae Ikeda of Tokyo Imperial University, which signals the presence of the amino acid L-glutamate, triggers a pleasurable response and thus encourages the intake of peptides and proteins. The amino acids in proteins are used in the body to build muscles and organs, transport molecules (hemoglobin), antibodies, and the organic catalysts known as enzymes. These are all critical molecules, and as such it is important to have a steady supply of amino acids, hence the pleasurable response to their presence in the mouth.\n\nIn Asian countries within the sphere of mainly Chinese and Indian cultural influence, pungency (piquancy or hotness) had traditionally been considered a sixth basic taste. In 2015, researchers suggested a new basic taste of fatty acids called fat taste, although oleogustus and pinguis have both been proposed as alternate terms.\n\nSweetness, usually regarded as a pleasurable sensation, is produced by the presence of sugars and a few other substances. Sweetness is often connected to aldehydes and ketones, which contain a carbonyl group. Sweetness is detected by a variety of G protein coupled receptors coupled to the G protein gustducin found on the taste buds. At least two different variants of the \"sweetness receptors\" must be activated for the brain to register sweetness. Compounds the brain senses as sweet are thus compounds that can bind with varying bond strength to two different sweetness receptors. These receptors are T1R2+3 (heterodimer) and T1R3 (homodimer), which account for all sweet sensing in humans and animals. Taste detection thresholds for sweet substances are rated relative to sucrose, which has an index of 1. The average human detection threshold for sucrose is 10 millimoles per liter. For lactose it is 30 millimoles per liter, with a sweetness index of 0.3, and 5-Nitro-2-propoxyaniline 0.002 millimoles per liter. “Natural” sweeteners such as saccharides activate the GPCR, which releases gustducin. The gustducin then activates the molecule adenylate cyclase, which catalyzes the production of the molecule cAMP, or adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate. This molecule closes potassium ion channels, leading to depolarization and neurotransmitter release. Synthetic sweeteners such as saccharin activate different GPCRs and induce taste receptor cell depolarization by an alternate pathway.\n\nSourness is the taste that detects acidity. The sourness of substances is rated relative to dilute hydrochloric acid, which has a sourness index of 1. By comparison, tartaric acid has a sourness index of 0.7, citric acid an index of 0.46, and carbonic acid an index of 0.06.\n\nSour taste is detected by a small subset of cells that are distributed across all taste buds in the tongue. Sour taste cells can be identified by expression of the protein PKD2L1, although this gene is not required for sour responses. There is evidence that the protons that are abundant in sour substances can directly enter the sour taste cells through apically located ion channels. This transfer of positive charge into the cell can itself trigger an electrical response. It has also been proposed that weak acids such as acetic acid, which is not fully dissociated at physiological pH values, can penetrate taste cells and thereby elicit an electrical response. According to this mechanism, intracellular hydrogen ions inhibit potassium channels, which normally function to hyperpolarize the cell.\nBy a combination of direct intake of hydrogen ions (which itself depolarizes the cell) and the inhibition of the hyperpolarizing channel, sourness causes the taste cell to fire action potentials and release neurotransmitter.\n\nThe most common food group that contains naturally sour foods is fruit, such as lemon, grape, orange, tamarind, and sometimes melon. Wine also usually has a sour tinge to its flavor, and if not kept correctly, milk can spoil and develop a sour taste. Children in the US and UK show a greater enjoyment of sour flavors than adults, and sour candy is popular in North America including Cry Babies, Warheads, Lemon drops, Shock Tarts and sour versions of Skittles and Starburst. Many of these candies contain citric acid or malic acid.\n\nThe simplest receptor found in the mouth is the sodium chloride (salt) receptor. Saltiness is a taste produced primarily by the presence of sodium ions. Other ions of the alkali metals group also taste salty, but the further from sodium, the less salty the sensation is. A sodium channel in the taste cell wall allows sodium cations to enter the cell. This on its own depolarizes the cell, and opens voltage-dependent calcium channels, flooding the cell with positive calcium ions and leading to neurotransmitter release. This sodium channel is known as an epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and is composed of three subunits. An ENaC can be blocked by the drug amiloride in many mammals, especially rats. The sensitivity of the salt taste to amiloride in humans, however, is much less pronounced, leading to conjecture that there may be additional receptor proteins besides ENaC to be discovered.\n\nThe size of lithium and potassium ions most closely resemble those of sodium, and thus the saltiness is most similar. In contrast, rubidium and caesium ions are far larger, so their salty taste differs accordingly. The saltiness of substances is rated relative to sodium chloride (NaCl), which has an index of 1. Potassium, as potassium chloride (KCl), is the principal ingredient in salt substitutes and has a saltiness index of 0.6.\n\nOther monovalent cations, e.g. ammonium (NH), and divalent cations of the alkali earth metal group of the periodic table, e.g. calcium (Ca), ions generally elicit a bitter rather than a salty taste even though they, too, can pass directly through ion channels in the tongue, generating an action potential. But the chloride of calcium is saltier and less bitter than potassium chloride, and is commonly used in pickle brine instead of KCl.\n\nBitterness is the most sensitive of the tastes, and many perceive it as unpleasant, sharp, or disagreeable, but it is sometimes desirable and intentionally added via various bittering agents. Common bitter foods and beverages include coffee, unsweetened cocoa, South American mate, bitter gourd, olives, citrus peel, many plants in the family Brassicaceae, dandelion greens, wild chicory, and escarole. The ethanol in alcoholic beverages tastes bitter, as do the additional bitter ingredients found in some alcoholic beverages including hops in beer and orange in bitters. Quinine is also known for its bitter taste and is found in tonic water.\n\nBitterness is of interest to those who study evolution, as well as various health researchers since a large number of natural bitter compounds are known to be toxic. The ability to detect bitter-tasting, toxic compounds at low thresholds is considered to provide an important protective function. Plant leaves often contain toxic compounds, yet even amongst leaf-eating primates, there is a tendency to prefer immature leaves, which tend to be higher in protein and lower in fiber and poisons than mature leaves. Amongst humans, various food processing techniques are used worldwide to detoxify otherwise inedible foods and make them palatable. Furthermore, the use of fire, changes in diet, and avoidance of toxins has led to neutral evolution in human bitter sensitivity. This has allowed several loss of function mutations that has led to a reduced sensory capacity towards bitterness in humans when compared to other species.\n\nThe threshold for stimulation of bitter taste by quinine averages a concentration of 8 μM (8 micromolar). The taste thresholds of other bitter substances are rated relative to quinine, which is thus given a reference index of 1. For example, brucine has an index of 11, is thus perceived as intensely more bitter than quinine, and is detected at a much lower solution threshold. The most bitter substance known is the synthetic chemical denatonium, which has an index of 1,000. It is used as an aversive agent (a bitterant) that is added to toxic substances to prevent accidental ingestion. It was discovered in 1958 during research on lignocaine, a local anesthetic, by MacFarlan Smith of Gorgie, Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\nResearch has shown that TAS2Rs (taste receptors, type 2, also known as T2Rs) such as TAS2R38 coupled to the G protein gustducin are responsible for the human ability to taste bitter substances. They are identified not only by their ability to taste for certain \"bitter\" ligands, but also by the morphology of the receptor itself (surface bound, monomeric). The TAS2R family in humans is thought to comprise about 25 different taste receptors, some of which can recognize a wide variety of bitter-tasting compounds. Over 670 bitter-tasting compounds have been identified, on a bitter database, of which over 200 have been assigned to one or more specific receptors. Recently it is speculated that the selective constraints on the TAS2R family have been weakened due to the relatively high rate of mutation and pseudogenization. Researchers use two synthetic substances, phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) and 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP) to study the genetics of bitter perception. These two substances taste bitter to some people, but are virtually tasteless to others. Among the tasters, some are so-called \"supertasters\" to whom PTC and PROP are extremely bitter. The variation in sensitivity is determined by two common alleles at the TAS2R38 locus. This genetic variation in the ability to taste a substance has been a source of great interest to those who study genetics.\n\nGustducin is made of three subunits. When it is activated by the GPCR, its subunits break apart and activate phosphodiesterase, a nearby enzyme, which in turn converts a precursor within the cell into a secondary messenger, which closes potassium ion channels. Also, this secondary messenger can stimulate the endoplasmic reticulum to release Ca2+ which contributes to depolarization. This leads to a build-up of potassium ions in the cell, depolarization, and neurotransmitter release. It is also possible for some bitter tastants to interact directly with the G protein, because of a structural similarity to the relevant GPCR.\n\nSavory, or savoriness is an appetitive taste and is occasionally described by its Japanese name, umami or meaty. It can be tasted in cheese and soy sauce,\nand is also found in many other fermented and aged foods. This taste is also present in tomatoes, grains, and beans.\n\nA loanword from Japanese meaning \"good flavor\" or \"good taste\", is considered fundamental to many Eastern cuisines; and other cuisines have long operated under principles that sought to combine foods to produce savory flavors, such as in the emphasis on veal stock by Auguste Escoffier, the pre-eminent chef of 19th century French cuisine, and in the Romans' deliberate use of fermented fish sauce. However, it was only recently recognized in modern science as a basic taste; well after the other basic tastes have been recognized by scientists, in part due to their correspondence with the four tastes of ancient Greek philosophy. Umami, or “scrumptiousness”, was first studied with the scientific method and identified by Kikunae Ikeda, who began to analyze kombu in 1907, attempting to isolate its dashi taste. He isolated a substance he called \"ajinomoto\", Japanese for “at the origin of flavor”. His Ajinomoto Co., Inc. currently employs over 32,000 people. \"Ajinomoto\" was later identified as the chemical monosodium glutamate (MSG), and increasingly used independently as a food additive, it is a sodium salt that produces a strong savory taste, especially combined with foods rich in nucleotides such as meats, fish, nuts, and mushrooms.\n\nSome savory taste buds respond specifically to glutamate in the same way that \"sweet\" ones respond to sugar. Glutamate binds to a variant of G protein coupled glutamate receptors. It is thought that the amino acid L-glutamate bonds to a type of GPCR known as a metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR4). This causes the G-protein complex to activate a secondary receptor, which ultimately leads to neurotransmitter release. The intermediate steps are not known.\n(See TAS1R1 and TAS1R3 pages for a further explanation of the amino-acid taste receptor).\n\nMeasuring the degree to which a substance presents one basic taste can be achieved in a subjective way by comparing its taste to a reference substance.\n\nSweetness is subjectively measured by comparing the threshold values, or level at which the presence of a dilute substance can be detected by a human taster, of different sweet substances. Substances are usually measured relative to sucrose, which is usually given an arbitrary index of 1 or 100. Fructose is about 1.4 times sweeter than sucrose; glucose, a sugar found in honey and vegetables, is about three-quarters as sweet; and lactose, a milk sugar, is one-half as sweet.\n\nThe sourness of a substance can be rated by comparing it to very dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n\nRelative saltiness can be rated by comparison to a dilute salt solution.\n\nQuinine, a bitter medicinal found in tonic water, can be used to subjectively rate the bitterness of a substance. Units of dilute quinine hydrochloride (1 g in 2000 mL of water) can be used to measure the threshold bitterness concentration, the level at which the presence of a dilute bitter substance can be detected by a human taster, of other compounds. More formal chemical analysis, while possible, is difficult.\n\nIn the human body a stimulus refers to a form of energy which elicits a physiological or psychological action or response. Sensory receptors are the structures in the body which change the stimulus from one form of energy to another. This can mean changing the presence of a chemical, sound wave, source of heat, or touch to the skin into an electrical action potential which can be understood by the brain, the body’s control center. Sensory receptors are modified ends of sensory neurons; modified to deal with specific types of stimulus, thus there are many different types of sensory receptors in the body. The neuron is the primary component of the nervous system, which transmits messages from sensory receptors all over the body.\n\nTaste is a form of chemoreception which occurs in the specialised taste receptors in the mouth. To date, there are five different types of taste receptors known: salt, sweet, sour, bitter, and umami. Each receptor has a different manner of sensory transduction: that is, of detecting the presence of a certain compound and starting an action potential which alerts the brain. It is a matter of debate whether each taste cell is tuned to one specific tastant or to several; Smith and Margolskee claim that \"gustatory neurons typically respond to more than one kind of stimulus, [a]lthough each neuron responds most strongly to one tastant\". Researchers believe that the brain interprets complex tastes by examining patterns from a large set of neuron responses. This enables the body to make \"keep or spit out\" decisions when there is more than one tastant present. \"No single neuron type alone is capable of discriminating among stimuli or different qualities, because a given cell can respond the same way to disparate stimuli.\" As well, serotonin is thought to act as an intermediary hormone which communicates with taste cells within a taste bud, mediating the signals being sent to the brain. Receptor molecules are found on the top of microvilli of the taste cells.\n\nSweetness is produced by the presence of sugars, some proteins, and a few other substances. It is often connected to aldehydes and ketones, which contain a carbonyl group. Sweetness is detected by a variety of G protein-coupled receptors coupled to a G protein that acts as an intermediary in the communication between taste bud and brain, gustducin. These receptors are T1R2+3 (heterodimer) and T1R3 (homodimer), which account for sweet sensing in humans and other animals.\n\nSaltiness is a taste produced best by the presence of cations (such as , or ) and is directly detected by cation influx into glial like cells via leak channels causing depolarisation of the cell.\n\nOther monovalent cations, e.g., ammonium, , and divalent cations of the alkali earth metal group of the periodic table, e.g., calcium, , ions, in general, elicit a bitter rather than a salty taste even though they, too, can pass directly through ion channels in the tongue.\n\nSourness is acidity, and, like salt, it is a taste sensed using ion channels. Undissociated acid diffuses across the plasma membrane of a presynaptic cell, where it dissociates in accordance with Le Chatelier's principle. The protons that are released then block potassium channels, which depolarise the cell and cause calcium influx. In addition, the taste receptor PKD2L1 has been found to be involved in tasting sour.\n\nResearch has shown that TAS2Rs (taste receptors, type 2, also known as T2Rs) such as TAS2R38 are responsible for the human ability to taste bitter substances. They are identified not only by their ability to taste certain bitter ligands, but also by the morphology of the receptor itself (surface bound, monomeric).\n\nThe amino acid glutamic acid is responsible for savoriness, but some nucleotides (inosinic acid and guanylic acid) can act as complements, enhancing the taste.\n\nGlutamic acid binds to a variant of the G protein-coupled receptor, producing a savory taste.\n\nThe tongue can also feel other sensations not generally included in the basic tastes. These are largely detected by the somatosensory system. In humans, the sense of taste is conveyed via three of the twelve cranial nerves. The facial nerve (VII) carries taste sensations from the anterior two thirds of the tongue, the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) carries taste sensations from the posterior one third of the tongue while a branch of the vagus nerve (X) carries some taste sensations from the back of the oral cavity.\n\nThe trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) provides information concerning the general texture of food as well as the taste-related sensations of peppery or hot (from spices).\n\nSubstances such as ethanol and capsaicin cause a burning sensation by inducing a trigeminal nerve reaction together with normal taste reception. The sensation of heat is caused by the food's activating nerves that express TRPV1 and TRPA1 receptors. Some such plant-derived compounds that provide this sensation are capsaicin from chili peppers, piperine from black pepper, gingerol from ginger root and allyl isothiocyanate from horseradish. The piquant (\"hot\" or \"spicy\") sensation provided by such foods and spices plays an important role in a diverse range of cuisines across the world—especially in equatorial and sub-tropical climates, such as Ethiopian, Peruvian, Hungarian, Indian, Korean, Indonesian, Lao, Malaysian, Mexican, New Mexican, Singaporean, Southwest Chinese (including Szechuan cuisine), Vietnamese, and Thai cuisines.\n\nThis particular sensation, called chemesthesis, is not a taste in the technical sense, because the sensation does not arise from taste buds, and a different set of nerve fibers carry it to the brain. Foods like chili peppers activate nerve fibers directly; the sensation interpreted as \"hot\" results from the stimulation of somatosensory (pain/temperature) fibers on the tongue. Many parts of the body with exposed membranes but no taste sensors (such as the nasal cavity, under the fingernails, surface of the eye or a wound) produce a similar sensation of heat when exposed to hotness agents. Asian countries within the sphere of, mainly, Chinese, Indian, and Japanese cultural influence, often wrote of pungency as a fifth or sixth taste.\n\nSome substances activate cold trigeminal receptors even when not at low temperatures. This \"fresh\" or \"minty\" sensation can be tasted in peppermint, spearmint, menthol, ethanol, and camphor. Caused by activation of the same mechanism that signals cold, TRPM8 ion channels on nerve cells, unlike the actual change in temperature described for sugar substitutes, this coolness is only a perceived phenomenon.\n\nBoth Chinese and Batak Toba cooking include the idea of 麻 (\"má\" or \"mati rasa\"), a tingling numbness caused by spices such as Sichuan pepper. The cuisines of Sichuan province in China and of the Indonesian province of North Sumatra often combine this with chili pepper to produce a 麻辣 \"málà\", \"numbing-and-hot\", or \"mati rasa\" flavor. These sensations although not taste fall into a category of Chemesthesis.\n\nSome foods, such as unripe fruits, contain tannins or calcium oxalate that cause an astringent or puckering sensation of the mucous membrane of the mouth. Examples include tea, red wine, rhubarb, some fruits of the genus \"Syzygium\", and unripe persimmons and bananas.\n\nLess exact terms for the astringent sensation are \"dry\", \"rough\", \"harsh\" (especially for wine), \"tart\" (normally referring to sourness), \"rubbery\", \"hard\" or \"styptic\".\n\nWhen referring to wine, \"dry\" is the opposite of \"sweet,\" and does not refer to astringency. Wines that contain tannins and so cause an astringent sensation are not necessarily classified as \"dry\", and \"dry\" wines are not necessarily astringent.\n\nIn the Indian Ayurvedic tradition, one of the six tastes is astringency (\"kasaaya\"). In Sinhala and Sri Lankan English it is referred to as \"kahata\". in Tamil it is referred to as thuvarppu.\n\nA metallic taste may be caused by food and drink, certain medicines or amalgam dental fillings. It is generally considered an off flavor when present in food and drink. A metallic taste may be caused by galvanic reactions in the mouth. In the case where it is caused by dental work, the dissimilar metals used may produce a measurable current. Some artificial sweeteners are perceived to have a metallic taste, which is detected by the TRPV1 receptors. Many people consider blood to have a metallic taste. A metallic taste in the mouth is also a symptom of various medical conditions, in which case it may be classified under the symptoms dysgeusia or parageusia, referring to distortions of the sense of taste, and can be caused by various kinds of medication, including saquinavir and zonisamide, and occupational hazards, such as working with pesticides.\n\nThe distinctive taste of chalk has been identified as the calcium component of that substance. In 2008, geneticists discovered a CaSR calcium receptor on the tongues of mice. The CaSR receptor is commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and brain. Along with the \"sweet\" T1R3 receptor, the CaSR receptor can detect calcium as a taste. Whether closely related genes in mice and humans means the phenomenon exists in humans as well is unknown.\n\nRecent research reveals a potential taste receptor called the CD36 receptor. CD36 was targeted as a possible lipid taste receptor because it binds to fat molecules (more specifically, long-chain fatty acids), and it has been localized to taste bud cells (specifically, the circumvallate and foliate papillae). There is a debate over whether we can truly taste fats, and supporters of our ability to taste free fatty acids (FFAs) have based the argument on a few main points: there is an evolutionary advantage to oral fat detection; a potential fat receptor has been located on taste bud cells; fatty acids evoke specific responses that activate gustatory neurons, similar to other currently accepted tastes; and, there is a physiological response to the presence of oral fat. Although CD36 has been studied primarily in mice, research examining human subjects' ability to taste fats found that those with high levels of CD36 expression were more sensitive to tasting fat than were those with low levels of CD36 expression; this study points to a clear association between CD36 receptor quantity and the ability to taste fat.\n\nOther possible fat taste receptors have been identified. G protein-coupled receptors GPR120 and GPR40 have been linked to fat taste, because their absence resulted in reduced preference to two types of fatty acid (linoleic acid and oleic acid), as well as decreased neuronal response to oral fatty acids.\n\nMonovalent cation channel TRPM5 has been implicated in fat taste as well, but it is thought to be involved primarily in downstream processing of the taste rather than primary reception, as it is with other tastes such as bitter, sweet, and savory.\n\nProposed alternate names to fat taste include oleogustus and pinguis, although these terms are not widely accepted. The main form of fat that is commonly ingested is triglycerides, which are composed of three fatty acids bound together. In this state, triglycerides are able to give fatty foods unique textures that are often described as creaminess. But this texture is not an actual taste. It is only during ingestion that the fatty acids that make up triglycerides are hydrolysed into fatty acids via lipases. The taste is commonly related to other, more negative, tastes such as bitter and sour due to how unpleasant the taste is for humans. Richard Mattes, a co-author of the study, explained that low concentrations of these fatty acids can create an overall better flavor in a food, much like how small uses of bitterness can make certain foods more rounded. However, a high concentration of fatty acids in certain foods is generally considered inedible. To demonstrate that individuals can distinguish fat taste from other tastes, the researchers separated volunteers into groups and had them try samples that also contained the other basic tastes. Volunteers were able to separate the taste of fatty acids into their own category, with some overlap with savory samples, which the researchers hypothesized was due to poor familiarity with both. The researchers note that the usual \"creaminess and viscosity we associate with fatty foods is largely due to triglycerides\", unrelated to the taste; while the actual taste of fatty acids is not pleasant. Mattes described the taste as \"more of a warning system\" that a certain food should not be eaten.\n\nThere are few regularly consumed foods rich in fat taste, due to the negative flavor that is evoked in large quantities. Foods whose flavor to which fat taste makes a small contribution include olive oil and fresh butter, along with various kinds of vegetable and nut oils.\n\nSome Japanese researchers refer to the \"kokumi\" of foods. This sensation has also been described as mouthfulness, and appears to be related to a number of , which activate a calcium-sensing receptor which is also sensitive to glutathione.\n\nTemperature can be an essential element of the taste experience. Food and drink that—in a given culture—is traditionally served hot is often considered distasteful if cold, and vice versa. For example, alcoholic beverages, with a few exceptions, are usually thought best when served at room temperature or chilled to varying degrees, but soups—again, with exceptions—are usually only eaten hot. A cultural example are soft drinks. In North America it is almost always preferred cold, regardless of season.\n\nA 2016 study suggested that humans can taste starch (specifically, a glucose oligomer) independently of other tastes such as sweetness. However, no specific chemical receptor has yet been found for this taste.\n\nThe glossopharyngeal nerve innervates a third of the tongue including the circumvallate papillae. The facial nerve innervates the other two thirds of the tongue and the cheek via the chorda tympani.\n\nThe pterygopalatine ganglia are ganglia (one on each side) of the soft palate. The greater petrosal, lesser palatine and zygomatic nerves all synapse here. The greater petrosal, carries soft palate taste signals to the facial nerve. The lesser palatine sends signals to the nasal cavity; which is why spicy foods cause nasal drip. The zygomatic sends signals to the lacrimal nerve that activate the lacrimal gland; which is the reason that spicy foods can cause tears. Both the lesser palatine and the zygomatic are maxillary nerves (from the trigeminal nerve).\n\nThe special visceral afferents of the vagus nerve carry taste from the epiglottal region of the tongue.\n\nThe lingual nerve (trigeminal, not shown in diagram) is deeply interconnected with chorda tympani in that it provides all other sensory info from the ⅔ of the tongue. This info is processed separately (nearby) in rostal lateral subdivision of nucleus of the solitary tract (NST).\n\nNST receives input from the amygdala (regulates oculomotor nuclei output), bed nuclei of stria terminalis, hypothalamus, and prefrontal cortex. NST is the topographical map that processes gustatory and sensory (temp, texture, etc.) info.\n\nReticular formation (includes Raphe nuclei responsible for serotonin production) is signaled to release serotonin during and after a meal to suppress appetite. Similarly, salivary nuclei are signaled to decrease saliva secretion.\n\nHypoglossal and thalamic connections aid in oral-related movements.\n\nHypothalamus connections hormonally regulate hunger and the digestive system.\n\nSubstantia innominata connects the thalamus, temporal lobe, and insula.\n\nEdinger-Westphal nucleus reacts to taste stimuli by dilating and constricting the pupils.\n\nSpinal ganglion are involved in movement.\n\nThe frontal operculum is speculated to be the memory and association hub for taste.\n\nThe insula cortex aids in swallowing and gastric motility.\n\nTaste can be objective in terms of the five tastes (sweet, salt, sour, bitter, and savory) but it can also be subjective in terms of what we deem \"good\" and \"bad.\" Taste is \"subjective, objective, and qualitative\". In terms of it being a philosophical concept, taste is hard to define because it is essentially subjective when pertaining to the personal preferences of individuals i.e. \"'de gustibus non est disputandum' (there is no disputing taste)\". We cannot tell someone they do not \"think\" something tastes good because we do not agree, and vice versa. In order to evaluate taste in this context, we must explore all the ways in which taste can be defined. According to Alan Weiss, taste fulfills the purpose of six functions: taste is the tool in which we use to define flavor; it is also flavor and how we categorize flavor (sweet or salty); it is the preference, we as the tastemakers, place on specific flavors and our demand for those flavors; it is whether we choose to like or dislike a certain taste and therefore allow it into our general society of acceptable tastes or exile it; it is the value in which we place on certain taste (one might believe one's taste in Bach or Rothko earns one capital); and lastly, with good judgement comes good taste and therefore, one with expressively good taste are expected to have good judgement, just as those in bad taste are expected to be in bad judgement \n\nA supertaster is a person whose sense of taste is significantly more sensitive than average. The cause of this heightened response is likely, at least in part, due to an increased number of fungiform papillae. Studies have shown that supertasters require less fat and sugar in their food to get the same satisfying effects. However, contrary to what one might think, these people actually tend to consume more salt than the average person. This is due to their heightened sense of the taste of bitterness, and the presence of salt drowns out the taste of bitterness. (This also explains why supertasters prefer salted cheddar cheese over non-salted.)\n\nAftertastes arise after food has been swallowed. An aftertaste can differ from the food it follows. Medicines and tablets may also have a lingering aftertaste, as they can contain certain artificial flavor compounds, such as aspartame (artificial sweetener).\n\nAn acquired taste often refers to an appreciation for a food or beverage that is unlikely to be enjoyed by a person who has not had substantial exposure to it, usually because of some unfamiliar aspect of the food or beverage, including bitterness, a strong or strange odor, taste, or appearance.\n\nPatients with Addison's disease, pituitary insufficiency, or cystic fibrosis sometimes have a hyper-sensitivity to the five primary tastes.\n\n\nIn the West, Aristotle postulated in c. 350 BCE that the two most basic tastes were sweet and bitter. He was one of the first to develop a list of basic tastes.\n\nAyurveda, an ancient Indian healing science, has its own tradition of basic tastes, comprising sweet, salty, sour, pungent, bitter & astringent.\n\nThe Ancient Chinese regarded spiciness as a basic taste.\n\nThe receptors for the basic tastes of bitter, sweet and savory have been identified. They are G protein-coupled receptors. The cells that detect sourness have been identified as a subpopulation that express the protein PKD2L1. The responses are mediated by an influx of protons into the cells but the receptor for sour is still unknown. The receptor for amiloride-sensitive attractive salty taste in mice has been shown to be a sodium channel.\nThere is some evidence for a sixth taste that senses fatty substances.\n\nIn 2010, researchers found bitter taste receptors in lung tissue, which cause airways to relax when a bitter substance is encountered. They believe this mechanism is evolutionarily adaptive because it helps clear lung infections, but could also be exploited to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\n<div col||20em|small=yes>\n<div col end>\n\na. It has been known for some time that these categories may not be comprehensive. In Guyton's 1976 edition of \"Textbook of Medical Physiology\", he wrote:On the basis of physiologic studies, there are generally believed to be at least four \"primary\" sensations of taste: \"sour\", \"salty\", \"sweet,\" and \"bitter\". Yet we know that a person can perceive literally hundreds of different tastes. These are all supposed to be combinations of the four primary sensations...However, there might be other less conspicuous classes or subclasses of primary sensations\",\n\nb. Some variation in values is not uncommon between various studies. Such variations may arise from a range of methodological variables, from sampling to analysis and interpretation. In fact there is a \"plethora of methods\" Indeed, the taste index of 1, assigned to reference substances such as sucrose (for sweetness), hydrochloric acid (for sourness), quinine (for bitterness), and sodium chloride (for saltiness), is itself arbitrary for practical purposes.\n\nSome values, such as those for maltose and glucose, vary little. Others, such as aspartame and sodium saccharin, have much larger variation. Regardless of variation, the perceived intensity of substances relative to each reference substance remains consistent for taste ranking purposes. The indices table for McLaughlin & Margolskee (1994) for example, is essentially the same as that of Svrivastava & Rastogi (2003), Guyton & Hall (2006), and Joesten \"et al.\" (2007). The rankings are all the same, with any differences, where they exist, being in the values assigned from the studies from which they derive.\n\nAs for the assignment of 1 or 100 to the index substances, this makes no difference to the rankings themselves, only to whether the values are displayed as whole numbers or decimal points. Glucose remains about three-quarters as sweet as sucrose whether displayed as 75 or 0.75.\n\n\n"}

Originally published in Italian as \"Regola delli cinque ordini d'architettura\", it has been fully or partially translated in English with different titles, including \"Canon of the Five Orders of Architecture\"; \"Rules of the Five Orders of Architecture\"; \"Vignola: an elementary treatise on architecture comprising the complete study of the five orders, with indication of their shadows and the first principles of construction\"; \"The Five Orders of Architecture according to Giacomo Barozzio of Vignola, to Which are Added the Greek Orders\"; and \"The five orders of architecture, the casting of shadows and the first principles of construction based on the system of Vignola\".\n\nThe book tackles the five orders, Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite in separate sections, each subdivided in five parts on the colonnade, arcade, arcade with pedestal, individual pedestals, and entablatures and capitals. Following those 25 sections were some less related parts on cornices and other elements. Written during the 1550s, it was published in 1562, and was soon considered the most practical work for the application of the five orders. Apart from the introduction, the book existed solely of 32 annotated plates, with views from the Pantheon illustrating the Corinthian order and the Theatre of Marcellus for the Doric order. Later editions had more illustrations.\n\nVignola was an Italian Renaissance architect who was the assistant of Michelangelo during his work on the St. Peter's Basilica. He was also one of the architects of the Palazzo Farnese and the Church of the Gesu. Following the examples of the Classical Roman work of Vitruvius and the five books of the \"Regole generali d'architettura\" by Sebastiano Serlio from 1537 on, Vignola started writing an architecture rule book on the classical orders. His work was more practical than the preceding two books which were more philosophical in nature.\n\nIt was over the next centuries often reprinted, translated, and used as an inspiration, e.g. for William Robert Ware's main work \"The American Vignola\" from 1904. By 1700, it had been reprinted 15 times in Italian, and was translated in Dutch, English, French, German, Russian and Spanish. By the end of the twentieth century, more than 250 editions of the book had been published, marking it as \"the most widely used architectural textbook of all up to the nineteenth century [...] forming one of the universal bases of courses of architecture\"\n\n"}

He served as a government official in Ankara, Honorary Consul of Turkey in Morocco and was the Sheikh of the Jerrahi Order in America. He died on February 15, 2018.\n\nBayrak was born in Istanbul in 1926. During his childhood, he'd been raised without religion in the household, having rarely visited a mosque with his parents; his interest in Hindu and Buddhist philosopher during high school was one of his few experiences with religion. Early in life, his grandfather helped to spark his interest in art and poetry with trips to museums as well as Topkapı Palace. Initially, he studied Biological Sciences at Robert College, graduating in 1945. It was during his time in college that he first became exposed to Islam as a living practice, lodging on weekends with his aunt who prayed five times a day and fasted during Ramadan.\n\nBayrak later went on to study Art, Architecture, and Art History in the Studios of Fernand Léger and Andre Lhote in Paris; Architecture at the University of California, Berkeley; and History of Art at the Courtauld Institute of Art, London. While in London, he was an associate of poet Can Yücel and former Prime Minister of Turkey Bülent Ecevit. He received a Masters in Fine Arts from Rutgers University.\n\nIn 1970 Bayrak met Muzaffer Ozak, who became his spiritual teacher, at the Jerrahi Lodge in Instanbul. Bayrak became a Sheikh of the Halveti-Jerrahi order and resided near the Jerrahi Order of America mosque in Spring Valley, New York a few years later. He acted as the spiritual guide of the Jerrahi Order of the Americas starting from 1977, and he founded the official mosque of the Order's American branch in Chestnut Ridge, New York in 1990. Though at one time an admirer of Fethullah Gülen, Bayrak condemned the Gülen movement at a winter 2016 art exhibit in Istanbul due to the movement's alleged involvement in the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt.\n\nIn response to the January 2015 Île-de-France attacks, which ended as Bayrak was planning a Friday sermon, he declared that the perpetrators were insane, not Muslims, and opposed the key teachings of Islam. Bayrak passed away in New York on 15 February 2018 at the age of 92.\n\nBayrak taught art and art history at Fairleigh Dickinson University, where he helped to establish the Fine Arts Division. His work was exhibited widely in the United States, and he became a Guggenheim fellow in 1965. He retired from the art world in the 1970s and devoted his life to the study and teaching of Islam and Sufism. \n\nBayrak translated dozens of books on Islamic spirituality, but he was particularly known for his efforts on the works of the Sufi mystic Ibn Arabi. One of his best known works is \"Ibn Arabi: The Tree of Being\". His translations of classic works of Sufism include Abdul Qadir Gilani's \"Secret of Secrets\", \"Inspirations\", and \"The Book of Sufi Chivalry\", \"Suhrawardi: The Shape of Light\", \"The Name and the Named: Divine Attributes of God\", and Imam Birgivi's \"The Path of Muhammad\".\n\n\n"}

Nau released an eponymous album by CBS in 1987, and also took part in the compilation \"Não São Paulo, Vol. 2\", released by Baratos Afins; however, it would disband in 1989, after plans for a second studio album fell through, and Vange followed with a solo career.\n\nHer first solo album, \"Vange\", was released in 1991 by Sony Music Entertainment, and spawned her most well-known song, \"Noite Preta\", which was used as the opening theme of the popular Brazilian \"telenovela\" \"Vamp\". Another song off the album, \"Esse Mundo\", would be used as the opening theme for another \"telenovela\", \"Perigosas Peruas\".\n\nHer second solo release, the EP \"Vermelho\", came out in 1996 by the independent label Medusa Records, founded by Vange and her domestic partner, journalist Cilmara Bedaque, in the same year. Bedaque also co-authored numerous of Vange's songs since the times of Nau. \"Vermelho\" was not as well-regarded as her previous album though, and Vange abandoned the musical career to devote herself to literature.\n\nVange came out as a lesbian in 1995, and since then began to milit toward the gay cause and women's rights.\n\nIn 1999 she published her first book, \"Lésbicas\", that was followed by \"Grrrls: Garotas Iradas\" in 2001; both were compilations of articles she wrote for now-defunct LGBT magazine \"Sui Generis\" from 1997 to 2000. She also wrote for the \"Revista da Folha\", \"CartaCapital\" and Mix Brasil, and alongside Cilmara Bedaque she also had a beer-related blog named \"Lupulinas\".\n\nIn 2000, she wrote her first theatre play, \"As Sereias da Rive Gauche\", that was performed in the same year under Regina Galdino's direction and published as a book in 2002. Her first and only novel, \"Balada para as Meninas Perdidas\", was released in 2003.\n\nHer fifth and last literary work was the play \"Joana Evangelista\", which came out in 2006; a modern-day reimagining of Joan of Arc's life, it deals with the theme of abortion.\n\nIn a 2012 interview, Vange stated that she was working on a translation to Portuguese of Djuna Barnes' 1928 novel \"Ladies Almanack\". Since then, however, no further announcements regarding the translation were given, and it is unknown if she got to finish the translation prior to her death.\n\nOn 6 November 2014, Vange was posthumously awarded the Order of Cultural Merit.\n\nIn mid-June 2014, Vange was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and was admitted to the Santa Isabel Hospital in São Paulo for treatment. The cancer eventually metastasized to her gastric mucosa, evolving to a terminal stage; thus, whatever treatment proved to be unsuccessful, and Vange died, aged 51, on 14 July 2014.\n\nShe was cremated and her ashes were buried the next day at the Horto da Paz Cemetery, in Itapecerica da Serra.\n\nVange began a relationship with Cilmara Bedaque in 1986, and the couple registered their domestic partnership in 1995.

It is a work of textual criticism, whereby all variations and emendations are set side by side so that a reader can track how textual decisions have been made in the preparation of a text for publication. The Bible and the works of William Shakespeare have often been the subjects of variorum editions, although the same techniques have been applied with less frequency to many other works.\n\nThe word \"variorum\" is Latin for 'of various [persons]' and derives from the phrase \"cum notis variorum\" ('with notes by various people') which was often used in the title-pages of Dutch books of the 17th century.\n\nAn older meaning of the word refers not to the text itself but to the assortment of illustrative notes printed with it: 'an edition of a text (usually Latin or Greek) which includes annotations by a variety of critics and commentators'. Variorum editions of this kind were a speciality of Dutch publishers of the 17th century, including the house of Elsevier. In these editions the text is usually taken, with little or no attempt at constructive modification, from a single widely accepted critical edition of the period; the interest lies in the notes, which often fill three-quarters of each page, and which typically embody the complete commentaries of two or three recognised specialists in the work of the author in question, together with selected passages from several other commentators. The notes will usually include textual variants, both documented and conjectural, together with examples of parallel usages and (for non-fiction texts) historical information. Usually some middle-ranking literary man was appointed as general editor; occasionally, however, a first-rate scholar would preside over the edition and include original work of his own within it, Nicolas Heinsius's edition of Claudian (Elsevier, 1661) being a good example.\n\nA variorum of the Bible has been produced at various times in history and of various scopes. Documenting each line of text with variants in wording, from known source documents, presented chronologically, helps translators of the Bible establish primacy and prevalence of various line readings.\n\nThere have also been noteworthy variorums of the works of William Shakespeare, including the readings of all quartos and folios; the textual decisions, or choices, of past editors; and a compilation of all critical notes. The first was that of Isaac Reed in 1803. Variorum editions help editors and scholars understand the historical evolution of the Shakespeare texts, as well as to decode dubious lines and decide upon most likely authorial intent.\n\nImmanuel Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason\" is typically presented in variorum format, with both the 1781 and 1787 editions printed side-by-side in nearly all modern editions.\n\nCharles Darwin's \"The Origin of Species\" went through six editions with extensive changes. The text became a third larger, with numerous parts rewritten five times. A variorum was published in 1959.\n\nThere is also a variorum of \"Leaves of Grass\". Walt Whitman produced either six or nine editions during his lifetime. The New York University Press produced a variorum in 1980 of these various editions.\n\nThe James Strachey translation of Freud's \"The Interpretation of Dreams\" in volumes four and five of \"The Standard Edition of The Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud\" collates eight editions.\n\nRabindranath Tagore's works have been collated to produce a voluminous digital variorum. It can be viewed on the Bichitra website.\n"}

He was educated at Bedales School and Worcester College, Oxford.\n\nAt Oxford, Bridges-Adams joined the Oxford University Dramatic Society and played the leading roles of Leontes in \"The Winter's Tale\" and Prospero in \"The Tempest\", but his talent for direction and design was already leading him from acting to a backstage role. He staged two operas for Sir Hugh Allen, and directed the Oxford millenary pageant. His design was influenced by the Post-Impressionists and by personal contacts with Charles Ricketts and Charles Shannon.\n\nAfter Oxford, Bridges-Adams began working in the professional theatre in 1911 under the managements of Laurence Irving, William Poel, Harley Granville-Barker and George Alexander. During this period Bridges-Adams occasionally worked as an actor, but more usually as a director and as a designer for other directors' productions. His first London production was in 1912 (a play called \"Job\", for the Norwich Players), and he became producer for the Bristol Old Vic repertory seasons, 1914–1915, and the Playhouse Theatre, Liverpool, 1916–1917. His designs for stage scenery included \"The Loving Heart\" at the New Theatre in 1918 (\"Quite the happiest feature of the production is Mr Bridges-Adams's scenery,\" said \"The Times\") and no fewer than nine Gilbert and Sullivan operas for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, beginning with \"Iolanthe\" in 1915, followed by \"Patience\" (1918), \"The Sorcerer, The Pirates of Penzance, Princess Ida, The Mikado, The Yeomen of the Guard\", and \"The Gondoliers\" (second act), all in 1919, and \"Ruddigore\" (1921).\n\nIn 1919, Bridges-Adams was appointed director of the Stratford-on-Avon Festival in succession to Sir Frank Benson. There were doubts about the continuing viability of the festival, and Bridges-Adams realised that changes and new ideas would be necessary. He threw himself into the task with great enthusiasm. His ambition was to win for Stratford an international status on a par with that of the Salzburg Festival. He secured the services of Theodore Komisarjevsky to direct \"The Merchant of Venice\" and \"Macbeth\", and he himself produced 29 of Shakespeare's plays between 1919 and his retirement in 1934.\nUnusually for the times, he presented Shakespeare's plays without cuts in the text, thereby earning the nickname 'Mr Unabridges-Adams'.\n\nThe original Memorial Theatre at Stratford was gutted by a disastrous fire in March 1926. Bridges-Adams' design for the stage layout of the replacement theatre (now the Royal Shakespeare Theatre) was followed by architect Elisabeth Scott when the new theatre was built in 1932.\n\nIn 1934 he resigned as director of the festival. \"The Times\", in its obituary notice states, possibly tactfully, that he felt new blood was needed, but the \"Dictionary of National Biography\" states that he was frustrated by the governors' failure to back him in his attempts to gain an international status for the theatre with more guest directors of international repute.\n\nIn 1936 Bridges-Adams directed Stravinsky's \"Oedipus Rex\" at Covent Garden, and he was appointed to the council of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and to the building advisory committee for the National Theatre. From 1937 to 1944 he worked as dramatic adviser to the British Council, promoting foreign tours of British works by British stage companies.\n\nHis publications include: \"The Shakespeare Country\", 1932; \"The British Theatre\", 1944; \"Looking at a Play\", 1947; \"The Lost Leader\", 1954; \"The Irresistible Theatre\", 1957; \"To Charlotte While Shaving\" (verse), 1957; and, posthumously, a collection of his letters edited by Robert Speaight, 1971.\n\nWilliam Bridges-Adams died at his home in Bantry, Ireland, aged 76, and was buried in the Abbey cemetery at Bantry.\n\n"}
