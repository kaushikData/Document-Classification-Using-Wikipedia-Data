{"id": "1933002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1933002", "title": "Album cover", "text": "Album cover\n\nAn album cover is the front of the packaging of a commercially released audio recording product, or album. The term can refer to either the printed cardboard covers typically used to package sets of and 78-rpm records, single and sets of LPs, sets of 45 rpm records (either in several connected sleeves or a box), or the front-facing panel of a CD package, and, increasingly, the primary image accompanying a digital download of the album, or of its individual tracks.\n\nIn the case of all types of tangible records, it also serves as part of the protective sleeve.\n\nAround 1910, 78-rpm records replaced the phonograph cylinder as the medium for recorded sound. The 78-rpm records were issued in both 10- and 12-inch diameter sizes and were usually sold separately, in brown paper or cardboard sleeves that were sometimes plain and sometimes printed to show the producer or the retailer's name. These were invariably made out of acid paper, limiting conservability. Generally the sleeves had a circular cutout allowing the record label to be seen. Records could be laid on a shelf horizontally or stood upright on an edge, but because of their fragility, many broke in storage.\n\nGerman record company Odeon pioneered the \"album\" in 1909 when it released the \"Nutcracker Suite\" by Tchaikovsky on four double-sided discs in a specially designed package. (It is not indicated what the specially designed package was.) The practice of issuing albums does not seem to have been taken up by other record companies for many years.\n\nBeginning in the 1920s, bound collections of empty sleeves with a plain paperboard or leather cover were sold as \"record albums\" (similar to a photograph album) that customers could use to store their records. (The name \"record album\" was printed on some covers.) These empty albums were sold in both 10- and 12-inch sizes. The covers of these bound books were wider and taller than the records inside, allowing the record album to be placed on a shelf upright, like a book, and suspending the fragile records above the shelf, protecting them.\n\nStarting in the 1930s, record companies began issuing collections of 78-rpm records by one performer or of one type of music in specially assembled collections. These albums of several 78-rpm records could include a collection of popular songs related by either performer or style, or extended-length classical music, including complete symphonies.\n\nIn 1938, Columbia Records hired Alex Steinweiss as its first art director. He is credited with inventing the concept of album covers and cover art, replacing the plain covers used before. After his initial efforts at Columbia, other record companies followed his lead. By the late 1940s, record albums for all the major companies featured their own colorful paper covers in both 10- and 12-inch sizes. Some featured reproductions of classic art while others utilized original designs.\n\nWhen the 10- and 12-inch long-playing records (LPs) came along in 1948, and box sets of 45-rpm records soon followed (see gramophone record), the name \"album\" was used for the new format of collections, and the creation of artistic original album covers continued.\n\nFrom the 1950s through to the 1980s, the 12\" LP record and the 45 rpm record became the major formats for the distribution of popular music. The LP format remains in use for occasional new releases, though other formats have largely supplanted it. The size of the typical cardboard LP sleeve cover is square.\n\nSince the mid-1990s, the compact disc (CD) has become the most common form of physically-distributed music products. Packaging formats vary, including the jewel case (which since 1982 has been the most popular form of CD packaging), and the cardboard and plastic combination commonly known as a Digipak (which has been a popular alternative form of packaging in recent years, but remains supplanted by the jewel case due to higher manufacturing costs and lower durability). Typically the album cover component of these packages is approximately square.\n\nThe Album Art Cover with eyecatching illustration, vibrant colours and lettering, is generally attributed to the American designer Alex Steinweiss in the 1950s.\n\nThe cover became an important part of the culture of music. Under the influence of designers like Bob Cato, who at various stages in his long music career was vice president of creative services at both Columbia Records and United Artists, album covers became renowned for being a marketing tool and an expression of artistic intent. Album art has also been discussed as an important postwar cultural expression.\n\nDuring the early 1960s, the Beatles' \"With the Beatles\", Bob Dylan's \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" and the Rolling Stones' self-titled debut album each contained a cover photograph designed to further the musical artist's public image. Author Peter Doggett also highlights the cover of Otis Redding's \"Otis Blue\", containing a photo of a young white woman, as a design that \"played a dual role: she represented the transcendent power of the music, and obscured the race of its creator.\" The standard portrait-based LP cover was further challenged over 1965–66 by Dylan's \"Bringing It All Back Home\", through the inclusion of symbolic artefacts around the singer; the artificially stretched faces of the Beatles shown on their \"Rubber Soul\" album; and the darkened hues applied to the Rolling Stones on \"Aftermath\".\n\nGatefold covers (a folded double cover) and inserts, often with lyric sheets, made the album cover a desirable work in its own right. Notable examples are the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", which had cut-out inserts, printed lyrics, and a gatefold sleeve, even though it was a single album; the Rolling Stones' \"Exile on Main Street\", which had a gatefold and a series of 12 perforated postcards as inserts (taken by photographer Norman Seeff); and Pink Floyd's \"The Dark Side of the Moon\", which had a gatefold, lyrics, no title on the sleeve, and poster and sticker inserts. The Band's 1970 release \"Stage Fright\", which included a photograph by Seeff as a poster insert, is an early example of LP artwork quickly becoming a collector's item. The move to the small (less than 1/4 the size of a record) CD format lost that impact, although attempts have been made to create a more desirable packaging for the CD format, for example the reissue of \"Sgt. Pepper\", which had a cardboard box and booklet, or the use of oversized packaging.\n\nThe importance of design was such that some cover artists specialised or gained fame through their work. Such people include the design team Hipgnosis, through their work on Pink Floyd albums, amongst others; Roger Dean, famous for his Yes and Greenslade covers; Cal Schenkel, for Captain Beefheart's \"Trout Mask Replica\" and Frank Zappa's \"We're Only in It for the Money\".\n\nThe talents of many photographers and illustrators from both inside and outside of the music industry have been used to produce a vast array of memorable LP/CD covers. Photographer Mick Rock produced some of the most iconographic album covers of the 1970s, including Queen's \"Queen II\" (recreated for their classic music video Bohemian Rhapsody), Syd Barrett's \"The Madcap Laughs\", and Lou Reed's \"Transformer\". From 1972 to 1975, photographer Norman Seeff was Creative Director at United Artists and in addition to his many cover photographs (The Band, Kiss's Hotter than Hell, Joni Mitchell's Hejira etc.), he art directed dozens of album covers including \"Exile on Main Street\", many of which received Grammy nominations. In addition to the examples mentioned previously, a number of world-renowned graphic artists and illustrators such as Ed Repka (Megadeth), Andy Warhol (The Velvet Underground, The Rolling Stones), Mati Klarwein (Santana, Miles Davis), H. R. Giger (Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Debbie Harry), Frank Frazetta (Molly Hatchet), Derek Riggs (Iron Maiden), Jamie Reid (The Sex Pistols), Howard Finster (R.E.M., Talking Heads), Al Hirschfeld (Aerosmith), Ken Kelly (Kiss, Manowar), Gottfried Helnwein (Marilyn Manson), Rex Ray (David Bowie), Robert Crumb (Big Brother & the Holding Company), John Van Hamersveld (The Rolling Stones), and Shepard Fairey (Johnny Cash) have all applied their talents to memorable music packages.\n\nA number of record covers have also used images licensed (or borrowed from the public domain) from artists of bygone eras. Well-known examples of this include the cover of Derek and the Dominos \"Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs\" (from the painting \"La Fille au Bouquet\" by French painter and sculptor Émile Théodore Frandsen de Schomberg), 'The Downfall of Icarus' by Genisson on the cover of the first album by Renaissance; Bosch on the cover of Deep Purple; Breugel on the cover of Fleet Foxes; the cover of Kansas's debut album, adapted from a mural by painter John Steuart Curry, Norman Rockwell's cowboy (Pure Prairie League), and, more recently, Coldplay's \"Viva La Vida\", which features Eugène Delacroix's painting \"Liberty Leading the People\" (a favorite in The Louvre) with the words \"VIVA LA VIDA\" brushed on top in white paint.\n\nLegends from photography and video/film who have also produced record cover images include Drew Struzan (Black Sabbath, Alice Cooper, Iron Butterfly, The Beach Boys and others), Annie Leibovitz (John Lennon, Bruce Springsteen, Patti Smith), Richard Avedon (Whitney Houston, Teddy Pendergrass), David LaChappelle (No Doubt, Elton John), Anton Corbijn (U2, The Killers, Depeche Mode), Karl Ferris (Jimi Hendrix, Donovan, The Hollies), Robert Mapplethorpe (Patti Smith, Peter Gabriel) and Francesco Scavullo (Diana Ross, Edgar Winter), David Michael Kennedy others.\n\nA number of artists and bands feature members who are, in their own right, accomplished illustrators, designers and photographers and whose talents are exhibited in the artwork they produced for their own recordings. Examples include Jimmy Page (\"Led Zeppelin IV\"), Chris Mars (Replacements' \"Pleased to Meet Me\" and others), Marilyn Manson (\"Lest We Forget...\"), Michael Stipe (REM's \"Accelerator\"), Thom Yorke (credited as \"Tchocky\" on misc. Radiohead records), Michael Brecker (\"Ringorama\"), Freddie Mercury (\"Queen I\"), Lynsey De Paul (\"Surprise\"), John Entwistle (\"Who By Numbers\"), Graham Coxon (\"13\" and most solo albums), Mike Shinoda (various Linkin Park albums), Joni Mitchell (\"Miles of Aisles\" and several others) as well for Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (\"So Far\"), and M.I.A. (credited variously on Elastica's \"The Menace\", her records), and Captain Beefheart, 'Mona Bone Jakon', 'Tea for the Tillerman' and 'Teaser and the Firecat' by Cat Stevens, Mika (all albums released to date), \"Music from Big Pink\" (for The Band), \"Self Portrait\" and \"Planet Waves\" by Bob Dylan, \"Walls and Bridges\" by John Lennon.\n\nAlbum cover art was the subject of a 2013 documentary film, \"The Cover Story: Album Art\", by Eric Christensen, a San Francisco Bay Area record collector.\n\nThe physical design of album covers has been the subject of creative innovation. \"Ogden's Nut Gone Flake\" by the Small Faces was originally in a circular metal tin, and \"Happy to Meet – Sorry to Part\" by Horslips was in an octagonal package. Anyway by Family was originally issued in an opaque plastic package through which a design (a Leonardo sketch) could be seen. \"Magical Mystery Tour\" by the Beatles was first released as a double EP with a booklet between the records. \"Sgt. Pepper\" contained a cardboard sheet of images, and \"The Beatles\" (often referred to as the White Album) contained four large glossy photos of the individual Beatles along with a poster-sized collage. \"Live at Leeds\" by The Who also contained a generous supply of posters and printed material. \"Led Zeppelin III\" had a front cover that contained a revolving disc which brought different images into view through small cut-outs in the outer sleeve. A similar effect was used for the band's later album \"Physical Graffiti\" with cut-outs of the windows of a brownstone building. The original issue of \"Sticky Fingers\" by the Rolling Stones had an actual zipper incorporated into the picture of the crotch area of a pair of jeans. \"The Velvet Underground and Nico\" album had a Warhol-designed cardboard banana on the cover that could be peeled back. The record company Vertigo had a black-and-white design on the centre label that produced a hypnotic optical effect when the disc revolved on the turntable.\n\nThe album cover is a component of the overall packaging of an album. Especially in the case of vinyl records with paperboard sleeves, these packages are prone to wear and tear, although wear and tear does often take place to some degree on covers contained within plastic cases. A variety of treatments could be applied to improve both their appearance and durability, such as clear plastic wrap. Many products have been available for the storage of vinyl albums, often clear plastic sleeves.\n\nThe surface of a vinyl record is readily damaged, so aside from the outer paperboard sleeve, there is usually an inner protective cover to protect against dust and handling. This is normally shaped to allow it to readily slide within the outer cover. The inner sleeve is either thin white paper, either plain or printed with information on other recordings available from the same company, or a paper sleeve supporting a thin plastic bag. These quite often have a circular cut out so that the record label can be read without directly handling the record, though when the inner sleeve is printed with lyrics, which became quite common, then there is usually no hole. Decca Records used a system of colour-coding on these sleeves where a blue color denoted a stereophonic recording while red denoted a monophonic recording (the mono record players of the time were not always compatible with stereo records). This system was begun in the 1960s to reduce packaging costs.\n\nPackaging formats for compact discs widened the variety of presentations as well, even as the size of the CD meant that album covers were no longer so large.\n\nBesides the practicalities of identifying specific records, album covers serve the purpose of advertising the musical contents on the LP, through the use of graphic design, photography, and/or illustration. An album cover normally has the artist's name, sometimes in logo form; and the album title. Occasionally, though more common on historical vinyl records, the cover may include a reference number; a branding (the label), and possibly a track listing. Other information is seldom included on the cover, and is usually contained on the rear or interior of the packaging, such as a track listing together with a more detailed list of those involved in making the record, band members, guest performers, engineers and producer. On the \"spine\" of the package, the artist, title, and reference number are usually repeated so that albums can be identified while tightly packed on a shelf.\n\nWith the increasing popularity of digital music downloading services and the inflating cost of conducting business, the purpose and prevalence of the album cover is evolving. While the music industry tries to keep up with technological and cultural shifts, the role that packaging (and thus the \"album cover\") will play in consumer music sales in the near future is uncertain, although its role is certainly changing, and digital forms of packaging will continue to surface, which, to some degree (and to some consumers) take the place of physical packaging. Both MP3 and WMA music files are able to contain embedded digital album artworks (called cover images or simply covers) in jpeg format. , physical music products, with a physical \"album cover\", continue to outsell digital downloads.\n\nIn August 2008, album cover designer Peter Saville, responsible for cover art on albums by New Order and Roxy Music, suggested that the album cover was dead.\n\nAlternately, some artists have used Internet technology to generate even more cover art. For instance, Nine Inch Nails initially released its album \"The Slip\" as a free download on the band's website, attaching separate but thematically connected images to each individual track.\n\nOne digital solution is the iTunes LP format for interactive album artwork introduced by Apple on 9 September 2009.\n\nAlbum art is still considered a vital part of the listening experience to many, and despite the less-tangible nature of digital images, there are still many collectors trading cover art and music.\n\nIn September 2018, Interactive Marketing and Creative Studio Beaumonde released a first of its kind fully immersive and interactive album cover for Houston-based rapper Trill Sammy. For the first time ever fans can view the 2D album like they traditionally would, then dive into the album cover via an immersive world available on Trill Sammy's Website. \n\nSome album covers have been banned due to violence, nudity and other imagery. Guns N' Roses's 1987 album \"Appetite for Destruction\"s cover depicted a robot rapist about to be punished by a metal avenger. Kanye West's 2010 album \"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\" depicted West naked being straddled by a phoenix with her bare breasts and bare buttocks showing.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "293226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=293226", "title": "Analects", "text": "Analects\n\nThe Analects (; Old Chinese: \"*run ŋ(r)aʔ\"; ), also known as the Analects of Confucius, is a collection of sayings and ideas attributed to the Chinese philosopher Confucius and his contemporaries, traditionally believed to have been compiled and written by Confucius's followers. It is believed to have been written during the Warring States period (475–221 BC), and it achieved its final form during the mid-Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD). By the early Han dynasty the \"Analects\" was considered merely a \"commentary\" on the Five Classics, but the status of the \"Analects\" grew to be one of the central texts of Confucianism by the end of that dynasty. \n\nDuring the late Song dynasty (960–1279) the importance of the \"Analects\" as a philosophy work was raised above that of the older Five Classics, and it was recognized as one of the \"Four Books\". The \"Analects\" has been one of the most widely-read and studied books in China for the last 2,000 years, and continues to have a substantial influence on Chinese and East Asian thought and values today.\n\nConfucius believed that the welfare of a country depended on the moral cultivation of its people, beginning from the nation's leadership. He believed that individuals could begin to cultivate an all-encompassing sense of virtue through \"ren\", and that the most basic step to cultivating \"ren\" was devotion to one's parents and older siblings. He taught that one's individual desires do not need to be suppressed, but that people should be educated to reconcile their desires via rituals and forms of propriety, through which people could demonstrate their respect for others and their responsible roles in society. He taught that a ruler's sense of virtue was his primary prerequisite for leadership. His primary goal in educating his students was to produce ethically well-cultivated men who would carry themselves with gravity, speak correctly, and demonstrate consummate integrity in all things.\n\nAccording to Ban Gu, writing in the \"Book of Han\", the \"Analects\" originated as individual records kept by Confucius's disciples of conversations between the Master and them, which were then collected and jointly edited by the disciples after Confucius's death in 479 BC. The work is therefore titled \"Lunyu\" meaning \"edited conversations\" or \"selected speeches\" (i.e. analects). This broadly forms the traditional account of the genesis of the work accepted by later generations of scholars, for example the Song dynasty neo-Confucian scholar Zhu Xi stated that \"Analects\" is the records of Confucius's first- and second-generation pupils. The view however was challenged by Qing dynasty philologist Cui Shu (崔述, 1740–1816) who argued on linguistic ground that the last five books are much later than the rest of the work. Many modern scholars now believe that the work was compiled over a period of around two hundred years, with some questioning the authenticity of some of the sayings. Because no texts of the \"Analects\" have been discovered earlier, and because the \"Analects\" was not referred to by name in any existing source before the early Han dynasty, some scholars have proposed dates as late as 140 BC for the text's compilation.\n\nRegardless of how early the text of the \"Analects\" existed, most \"Analects\" scholars believe that, by the early Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD) the book was widely known and transmitted throughout China in a mostly complete form, and the book acquired its final, complete form during Han dynasty. A Han dynasty writer Wang Chong however claimed that the \"Analects\" that existed during the Han dynasty was incomplete and formed only a part of a much larger work. A larger collection of Confucius's teachings existed in the Warring States period than has been preserved directly in the \"Analects\": 75% of Confucius's sayings cited by his second-generation student, Mencius, do not exist in the received text of the \"Analects\".\n\nAccording to the Han dynasty scholar Liu Xiang, there were two versions of the \"Analects\" that existed at the beginning of the Han dynasty: the \"Lu version\" and the \"Qi version\". The Lu version contained twenty chapters, and the Qi version contained twenty-two chapters, including two chapters not found in the Lu version. Of the twenty chapters that both versions had in common, the Lu version had more passages. Each version had its own masters, schools, and transmitters. In the reign of Emperor Jing of Han (r. 157–141 BC), a third version (the \"Old Text\" version) was discovered hidden in a wall of the home then believed to be Confucius's when the home was in the process of being destroyed by King Gong of Lu (r. 153–128 BC) in order to expand the king's palace. The new version did not contain the two extra chapters found in the Qi version, but it split one chapter found in the Lu and Qi versions in two, so it had twenty-one chapters, and the order of the chapters was different. The old text version got its name because it was written in characters not used since the earlier Warring States period (i.e. before 221 BC), when it was assumed to have been hidden. According to the Han dynasty scholar Huan Tan, the old text version had four hundred characters different from the Lu version (from which the received text of the \"Analects\" is mostly based), and it seriously differed from the Lu version in twenty-seven places. Of these twenty-seven differences, the received text only agrees with the old text version in two places.\n\nOver a century later, the tutor of the \"Analects\" to Emperor Cheng of Han, (d. 5 BC), synthesized the Lu and Qi versions by taking the Lu version as authoritative and selectively adding sections from the Qi version, and produced a composite text of the \"Analects\" known as the \"Zhang Hou Lun\". This text was recognized by Zhang Yu's contemporaries and by subsequent Han scholars as superior to either individual version, and is the text that is recognized as the \"Analects\" today. The Qi version was lost for about 1800 years but re-found during the excavation of the tomb of Marquis of Haihun that was found 2011. No complete copies of either the Lu version or the old text version of the \"Analects\" exist today, though fragments of the old text version were discovered at Dunhuang.\n\nBefore the late twentieth century the oldest existing copy of the \"Analects\" known to scholars was found in the \"Stone Classics of the Xinping Era\", a copy of the Confucian classics written in stone in the old Eastern Han dynasty capital of Luoyang around 175 AD. Archaeologists have since discovered two handwritten copies of the \"Analects\" that were written around 50 BC, during the Western Han dynasty. They are known as the \"Dingzhou \"Analects\"\", and the \"Pyongyang \"Analects\"\", after the location of the tombs in which they were found. The Dingzhou \"Analects\" was discovered in 1973, but no transcription of its contents was published until 1997. The Pyongyang \"Analects\" was discovered in 1992. Academic access to the Pyongyang \"Analects\" has been highly restricted, and no academic study on it was published until 2009.\n\nThe Dingzhou \"Analects\" was damaged in a fire shortly after it was entombed in the Han dynasty. It was further damaged in an earthquake shortly after it was recovered, and the surviving text is just under half the size of the received text of the \"Analects\". Of the sections that survive, the Dingzhou \"Analects\" is shorter than the received \"Analects\", implying that the text of the \"Analects\" was still in the process of expansion when the Dingzhou \"Analects\" was entombed. There was evidence that \"additions\" may have been made to the manuscript after it had been completed, indicating that the writer may have become aware of at least one other version of the \"Analects\" and included \"extra\" material for the sake of completeness. The content of the Pyongyang \"Analects\" is similar to the Dingzhou \"Analects\"; but, because of the secrecy and isolationism of the North Korean government, only a very cursory study of it has been made available to international scholars, and its contents are not completely known outside of North Korea. Scholars do not agree about whether either the Dingzhou \"Analects\" or the Pyongyang \"Analects\" represent the Lu version, the Qi version, the old text version, or a different version that was independent of these three traditions.\n\nDuring most of the Han period the \"Analects\" was not considered one of the principal texts of Confucianism. During the reign of Han Wudi (141–87 BC), when the Chinese government began promoting Confucian studies, only the Five Classics were considered by the government to be canonical (\"jing\"). They were considered Confucian because Confucius was assumed to have partially written, edited, and/or transmitted them. The \"Analects\" was considered secondary as it was thought to be merely a collection of Confucius's oral \"commentary\" (\"zhuan\") on the Five Classics.\n\nThe political importance and popularity of Confucius and Confucianism grew throughout the Han dynasty, and by the Eastern Han the \"Analects\" was widely read by schoolchildren and anyone aspiring to literacy, and often read before the Five Classics themselves. During the Eastern Han, the heir apparent was provided a tutor specifically to teach him the \"Analects\". The growing importance of the \"Analects\" was recognized when the Five Classics was expanded to the \"Seven Classics\": the Five Classics plus the \"Analects\" and the \"Classic of Filial Piety\", and its status as one of the central texts of Confucianism continued to grow until the late Song dynasty (960–1279), when it was identified and promoted as one of the Four Books by Zhu Xi and generally accepted as being more insightful than the older Five Classics.\n\nSince the Han dynasty, Chinese readers have interpreted the \"Analects\" by reading scholars' commentaries on the book. There have been many commentaries on the \"Analects\" since the Han dynasty, but the two which have been most influential have been the \"Collected Explanations of the Analects\" (\"Lunyu Jijie\") by He Yan (c. 195–249) and several colleagues, and the \"Collected Commentaries of the Analects\" (\"Lunyu Jizhu\") by Zhu Xi (1130–1200). In his work, He Yan collected, selected, summarized, and rationalized what he believed to be the most insightful of all preceding commentaries on the \"Analects\" which had been produced by earlier Han and Wei dynasty (220–265 AD) scholars. His personal interpretation of the \"Lunyu\" was guided by his belief that Daoism and Confucianism complemented each other, so that by studying both in a correct manner a scholar could arrive at a single, unified truth. Arguing for the ultimate compatibility of Daoist and Confucian teachings, he argued that \"Laozi [in fact] was in agreement with the Sage\" (sic). The \"Explanations\" was written in 248 AD, was quickly recognized as authoritative, and remained the standard guide to interpreting the \"Analects\" for nearly 1,000 years, until the early Yuan dynasty (1271–1368). It is the oldest complete commentary on the \"Analects\" that still exists.\n\nHe Yan's commentary was eventually displaced as the definitive, standard commentary by Zhu Xi's commentary. Zhu Xi's work also brought together the commentaries of earlier scholars (mostly from the Song dynasty), along with his own interpretations. Zhu's work took part in the context of a period of renewed interest in Confucian studies, in which Chinese scholars were interested in producing a single \"correct\" intellectual orthodoxy that would \"save\" Chinese traditions and protect them from foreign influences, and in which scholars were increasingly interested in metaphysical speculation.\n\nIn his commentary Zhu made a great effort to interpret the \"Analects\" by using theories elaborated in the other Four Books, something that He Yan had not done. Zhu attempted to give an added coherence and unity to the message of the \"Analects\", demonstrating that the individual books of the Confucian canon gave meaning to the whole, just as the whole of the canon gave meaning to its parts. In his preface, Zhu Xi stated, \"[T]he \"Analects\" and the \"Mencius\" are the most important works for students pursuing the Way [...] The words of the \"Analects\" are all inclusive; what they teach is nothing but the essentials of preserving the mind and cultivating [one's] nature.\" From the first publication of the \"Commentaries\", Zhu continued to refine his interpretation for the last thirty years of his life. In the fourteenth century, the Chinese government endorsed Zhu's commentary, and until 1905 it was read and memorized along with the \"Analects\" by all Chinese aspiring to literacy and employment as government officials.\n\nVery few reliable sources about Confucius exist besides that of the Analects. The principal biography available to historians is included in Sima Qian's \"Shiji\", but, because the \"Shiji\" contains a large amount of (possibly legendary) material not confirmed by extant sources, the biographical material on Confucius found in the \"Analects\" makes the \"Analects\" arguably the most reliable source of biographical information about Confucius. Confucius viewed himself as a \"transmitter\" of social and political traditions originating in the early Zhou dynasty (c. 1000–800 BC), and claimed not to have originated anything (\"Analects\" 7.1), but Confucius's social and political ideals were not popular in his time.\n\nConfucius's discussions on the nature of the supernatural (\"Analects\" 3.12; 6.20; 11.11) indicate that he believed while \"ghosts\" and \"spirits\" should be respected, they are best kept at a distance. Instead human beings should base their values and social ideals on moral philosophy, tradition, and a natural love for others. Confucius's social philosophy largely depended on the cultivation of \"ren\" by every individual in a community. Later Confucian philosophers explained \"ren\" as the quality of having a kind manner, similar to the English words \"humane\", \"altruistic\", or \"benevolent\", but, of the sixty instances in which Confucius discusses \"ren\" in the \"Analects\", very few have these later meanings. Confucius instead used the term \"ren\" to describe an extremely general and all-encompassing state of virtue, one which no living person had attained completely. (This use of the term \"ren\" is peculiar to the \"Analects\".)\n\nThroughout the \"Analects\", Confucius's students frequently request that Confucius define \"ren\" and give examples of people who embody it, but Confucius generally responds indirectly to his students' questions, instead offering illustrations and examples of behaviours that are associated with \"ren\" and explaining how a person could achieve it. According to Confucius, a person with a well-cultivated sense of \"ren\" would speak carefully and modestly (\"Analects\" 12.3); be resolute and firm (\"Analects\" 12.20), courageous (\"Analects\" 14.4), free from worry, unhappiness, and insecurity (\"Analects\" 9.28; 6.21); moderate their desires and return to propriety (\"Analects\" 12.1); be respectful, tolerant, diligent, trustworthy and kind (\"Analects\" 17.6); and love others (\"Analects\" 12.22). Confucius recognized his followers' disappointment that he would not give them a more comprehensive definition of \"ren\", but assured them that he was sharing all that he could (\"Analects\" 7.23).\n\nTo Confucius, the cultivation of \"ren\" involved depreciating oneself through modesty while avoiding artful speech and ingratiating manners that would create a false impression of one's own character (\"Analects\" 1.3). Confucius said that those who had cultivated \"ren\" could be distinguished by their being \"simple in manner and slow of speech.\" He believed that people could cultivate their sense of \"ren\" through exercising the inverted Golden Rule: \"Do not do to others what you would not like done to yourself\"; \"a man with \"ren\", desiring to establish himself, helps others establish themselves; desiring to succeed himself, helps others to succeed\" (\"Analects\" 12.2; 6.28). He taught that the ability of people to imagine and project themselves into the places of others was a crucial quality for the pursuit of moral self-cultivation (\"Analects\" 4.15; see also 5.12; 6.30; 15.24). Confucius regarded the exercise of devotion to one's parents and older siblings as the simplest, most basic way to cultivate \"ren\". (\"Analects\" 1.2).\n\nConfucius believed that \"ren\" could best be cultivated by those who had already learned self-discipline, and that self-discipline was best learned by practicing and cultivating one's understanding of \"li\": rituals and forms of propriety through which people demonstrate their respect for others and their responsible roles in society (\"Analects\" 3.3). Confucius said that one's understanding of \"li\" should inform everything that one says and does (\"Analects\" 12.1). He believed that subjecting oneself to \"li\" did not mean suppressing one's desires, but learning to reconcile them with the needs of one's family and broader community. By leading individuals to express their desires within the context of social responsibility, Confucius and his followers taught that the public cultivation of \"li\" was the basis of a well-ordered society (\"Analects\" 2.3). Confucius taught his students that an important aspect of \"li\" was observing the practical social differences that exist between people in daily life. In Confucian philosophy these \"five relationships\" include: ruler to ruled; father to son; husband to wife; elder brother to younger brother; and friend to friend.\n\n\"Ren\" and \"li\" have a special relationship in the \"Analects\": \"li\" manages one's relationship with one's family and close community, while \"ren\" is practiced broadly and informs one's interactions with all people. Confucius did not believe that ethical self-cultivation meant unquestioned loyalty to an evil ruler. He argued that the demands of \"ren\" and \"li\" meant that rulers could oppress their subjects only at their own peril: \"You may rob the Three Armies of their commander, but you cannot deprive the humblest peasant of his opinion\" (\"Analects\" 9.26). Confucius said that a morally well-cultivated individual would regard his devotion to loving others as a mission for which he would be willing to die (\"Analects\" 15.8).\n\nConfucius's political beliefs were rooted in his belief that a good ruler would be self-disciplined, would govern his subjects through education and by his own example, and would seek to correct his subjects with love and concern rather than punishment and coercion. \"If the people be led by laws, and uniformity among them be sought by punishments, they will try to escape punishment and have no sense of shame. If they are led by virtue, and uniformity sought among them through the practice of ritual propriety, they will possess a sense of shame and come to you of their own accord\" (\"Analects\" 2.3; see also 13.6). Confucius's political theories were directly contradictory to the Legalistic political orientations of China's rulers, and he failed to popularize his ideals among China's leaders within his own lifetime.\n\nConfucius believed that the social chaos of his time was largely due to China's ruling elite aspiring to, and claiming, titles of which they were unworthy. When the ruler of the large state of Qi asked Confucius about the principles of good government, Confucius responded: \"Good government consists in the ruler being a ruler, the minister being a minister, the father being a father, and the son being a son\" (\"Analects\" 12.11). Confucius's analysis of the need to raise officials' behavior to reflect the way that they identify and describe themselves is known as the rectification of names, and he stated that the rectification of names should be the first responsibility of a ruler upon taking office (\"Analects\" 13.3). Confucius believed that, because the ruler was the model for all who were under him in society, the rectification of names had to begin with the ruler, and that afterwards others would change to imitate him (\"Analects\" 12.19).\n\nConfucius judged a good ruler by his possession of \"de\" (\"virtue\"): a sort of moral force that allows those in power to rule and gain the loyalty of others without the need for physical coercion (\"Analects\" 2.1). Confucius said that one of the most important ways that a ruler cultivates his sense of \"de\" is through a devotion to the correct practices of \"li\". Examples of rituals identified by Confucius as important to cultivate a ruler's \"de\" include: sacrificial rites held at ancestral temples to express thankfulness and humility; ceremonies of enfeoffment, toasting, and gift exchanges that bound nobility in complex hierarchical relationships of obligation and indebtedness; and, acts of formal politeness and decorum (i.e. bowing and yielding) that identify the performers as morally well-cultivated.\n\nThe importance of education and study is a fundamental theme of the \"Analects\". For Confucius, a good student respects and learns from the words and deeds of his teacher, and a good teacher is someone older who is familiar with the ways of the past and the practices of antiquity (\"Analects\" 7.22). Confucius emphasized the need to find balance between formal study and intuitive self-reflection (\"Analects\" 2.15). When teaching he is never cited in the \"Analects\" as lecturing at length about any subject, but instead challenges his students to discover the truth through asking direct questions, citing passages from the classics, and using analogies (\"Analects\" 7.8). He sometimes required his students to demonstrate their understanding of subjects by making intuitive conceptual leaps before accepting their understanding and discussing those subjects at greater levels of depth. (\"Analects\" 3.8)\n\nHis primary goal in educating his students was to produce ethically well-cultivated men who would carry themselves with gravity, speak correctly, and demonstrate consummate integrity in all things (\"Analects\" 12.11; see also 13.3). He was willing to teach anyone regardless of social class, as long as they were sincere, eager, and tireless to learn (\"Analects\" 7.7; 15.38). He is traditionally credited with teaching three thousand students, though only seventy are said to have mastered what he taught. He taught practical skills, but regarded moral self-cultivation as his most important subject.\n\nIn China, the traditional titles given to each chapter are mostly an initial two or three incipits. In some cases a title may indicate a central theme of a chapter, but it is inappropriate to regard a title as a description or generalization of the content of a chapter. Chapters in the \"Analects\" are grouped by individual themes, but the chapters are not arranged in a way as to carry a continuous stream of thoughts or ideas. The themes of adjacent chapters are completely unrelated to each other. Central themes recur repeatedly in different chapters, sometimes in exactly the same wording and sometimes with small variations.\n\nChapter 10 contains detailed descriptions of Confucius's behaviors in various daily activities. Voltaire and Ezra Pound believed that this chapter demonstrated how Confucius was a mere human. Simon Leys, who recently translated the \"Analects\" into English and French, said that the book may have been the first in human history to describe the life of an individual, historic personage. Elias Canetti wrote: \"Confucius's \"Analects\" is the oldest complete intellectual and spiritual portrait of a man. It strikes one as a modern book; everything it contains and indeed everything it lacks is important.\"\n\nWithin these incipits a large number of passages in the Analects begin with the formulaic \"ziyue\", \"The Master said,\" but without punctuation marks in classical Chinese, this does not confirm whether what follows \"ziyue\" is direct quotation of actual sayings of Confucius, or simply to be understood as \"the Master said that..\" and the paraphrase of Confucius by the compilers of the Analects.\n\n\n\n"}

The film had a limited theatrical release beginning February 14, 2013, and was released to DVD on May 6, 2014. It stars Chantelle Albers as a young woman that finds herself being terrorized by an axe-wielding killer.\n\nIn a cabin by Cutter's Creek, three bank robbers are murdered by an axe-wielding mountain man. Later, a group of friends, led by Brian, are brought to the same cabin by a guide, who is apprehensive about being in the area. After settling in, Brian mentions that the reason he got the cabin for such a low price is because it supposedly once belonged to a family that was massacred by the Axeman, an unidentified serial killer whose reign of terror ended as mysteriously as it started. When the discussion concludes, Randy goes off to spy on Vivian, and is murdered by the Axeman, who rips his head off.\n\nThe next morning, Doug gets into an argument with his girlfriend, Cassidy, accusing her of still having feelings for her ex, Brian, who is now dating Cassidy's best friend, Stacy. Doug storms off into the woods, where he stumbles onto the money that the bank robbers stole. While looking for somewhere to hide the cash, Doug is impaled and dismembered by the Axeman, his death going unnoticed by his friends, who are searching for Randy. Everyone soon regroups at the cabin, and Cassidy, unsatisfied with every explanation that they can come up with for why Randy, and now Doug, are gone, leaves to continue searching for them alone.\n\nTammy enters the garage, where she uncovers the robbers' money, and is forced to hide when the Axeman enters with her girlfriend, Liz, who he has fatally wounded. Before he can finish Liz off, the Axeman is distracted by a knock on the door, and answers it to reveal it is the sheriff, who he identifies himself to as \"Bill\". Annoyed by the sheriff's abrasive attitude and persistent questioning, Bill twists her head around, and returns to the garage, just as Tammy exits it with Liz. Liz succumbs to her injuries, and Tammy is strangled by Bill, who also bites off and eats her cheeks.\n\nReturning to the cabin, Bill rips Brian's brain out, knifes Vivian in the eye, beats Darren nearly to death, and chases Stacy through the property, catching and stabbing her when she trips over Cassidy's body. In the morning, the hungover Deputy Whitfield ventures to the cabin in search of the sheriff, and finds Darren, who begs her for help. Before Darren can elaborate on what happened, Bill attacks him and Whitfield.\n\n\n\"Bloody Disgusting\" panned the film overall, criticizing the script for not delving into the reasons that the titular Axeman was killing people, as this would give the film more depth and differentiate it from multiple similarly plotted films. Theron Moore of Horror News praised the film's villain and kills, but criticized the glacial pace, uninteresting subplots, stiff acting, and two-dimensional dialogue and writing. \"Ain't It Cool News\" gave a mostly favorable review for \"Axeman\", commenting that while the movie was not \"reinventing the slasher genre\" it \"does feel like a throwback to a time when the slashers weren't so passé.\"\n\nA sequel is currently underway, titled \"Axeman 2: Overkill\". Principal photography was scheduled to begin in September 2014 and the film had a tentative release date of 2015. Wrestler Bryan Clark will replace Scot Pollard as the titular character and the film will be directed by Joston Theney. \"Axeman 2: Overkill\" was completed in 2014 and was released straight-to-DVD and online retailers on October 17, 2017.\n"}
{"id": "858784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=858784", "title": "Black Arts Movement", "text": "Black Arts Movement\n\nThe Black Arts Movement, Black Aesthetics Movement or BAM is the artistic outgrowth of the Black Power movement that was prominent in the 1960s and early 1970s. \"Time\" magazine describes the Black Arts Movement as the \"single most controversial movement in the history of African-American literature – possibly in American literature as a whole.\" The Black Arts Repertory Theatre/School (BARTS), founded in Harlem in 1965 by LeRoi Jones (later known as Amiri Baraka) is a key institution of the Black Arts Movement.\n\nThe movement has been seen as one of the most important times in African-American literature. It inspired black people to establish their own publishing houses, magazines, journals and art institutions. It led to the creation of African-American Studies programs within universities. The movement was triggered by the assassination of Malcolm X. Among the well-known writers who were involved with the movement are Nikki Giovanni, Sonia Sanchez, Maya Angelou, Hoyt W. Fuller, and Rosa Guy. Although not strictly part of the Movement, other notable African-American writers such as novelists Toni Morrison and Ishmael Reed share some of its artistic and thematic concerns. Although Reed is neither a movement apologist nor advocate, he said:\n\nI think what Black Arts did was inspire a whole lot of Black people to write. Moreover, there would be no multiculturalism movement without Black Arts. Latinos, Asian Americans, and others all say they began writing as a result of the example of the 1960s. Blacks gave the example that you don't have to assimilate. You could do your own thing, get into your own background, your own history, your own tradition and your own culture. I think the challenge is for cultural sovereignty and Black Arts struck a blow for that.\n\nBAM influenced the world of literature with the portrayal of different ethnic voices. Before the movement, the literary canon lacked diversity, and the ability to express ideas from the point of view of racial and ethnic minorities, which was not valued by the mainstream at the time.\n\nTheatre groups, poetry performances, music and dance were centered on this movement, and therefore African Americans gained social and historical recognition in the area of literature and arts. Due to the agency and credibility given, African Americans were also able to educate others through different types of expressions and media outlets about cultural differences. The most common form of teaching was through poetry reading. African-American performances were used for their own political advertisement, organization, and community issues. The Black Arts Movement was spread by the use of newspaper advertisements. The first major arts movement publication was in 1964.\n\n\"No one was more competent in [the] combination of the experimental and the vernacular than Amiri Baraka, whose volume \"Black Magic Poetry 1961–1967\" (1969) is one of the finest products of the African-American creative energies of the 1960s.\"\n\nThe beginnings of the Black Arts Movement may be traced to 1965, when Amiri Baraka, at that time still known as Leroi Jones, moved uptown to establish the Black Arts Repertory Theatre/School (BARTS) following the assassination of Malcolm X. Rooted in the Nation of Islam, the Black Power Movement and the Civil Rights Movement, the Black Arts Movement grew out of a changing political and cultural climate in which Black artists attempted to create politically engaged work that explored the African American cultural and historical experience. Black artists and intellectuals such as Baraka made it their project to reject older political, cultural, and artistic traditions.\n\nAlthough the success of sit-ins and public demonstrations of the Black student movement in the 1960s may have \"inspired black intellectuals, artists, and political activists to form politicized cultural groups,\" many Black Arts activists rejected the non-militant integrational ideologies of the Civil Rights Movement and instead favored those of the Black Liberation Struggle, which emphasized \"self-determination through self-reliance and Black control of significant businesses, organization, agencies, and institutions.\" According to the Academy of American Poets, \"African American artists within the movement sought to create politically engaged work that explored the African American cultural and historical experience.\" The importance that the movement placed on Black autonomy is apparent through the creation of institutions such as the Black Arts Repertoire Theatre School (BARTS), created in the spring of 1964 by Baraka and other Black artists. The opening of BARTS in New York City often overshadow the growth of other radical Black Arts groups and institutions all over the United States. In fact, transgressional and international networks, those of various Left and nationalist (and Left nationalist) groups and their supports, existed far before the movement gained popularity. Although the creation of BARTS did indeed catalyze the spread of other Black Arts institutions and the Black Arts movement across the nation, it was not solely responsible for the growth of the movement.\n\nAlthough the Black Arts Movement was a time filled with black success and artistic progress, the movement also faced social and racial ridicule. The leaders and artists involved called for Black Art to define itself and speak for itself from the security of its own institutions. For many of the contemporaries the idea that somehow black people could express themselves through institutions of their own creation and with ideas whose validity was confirmed by their own interests and measures was absurd.\n\nWhile it is easy to assume that the movement began solely in the Northeast, it actually started out as \"separate and distinct local initiatives across a wide geographic area,\" eventually coming together to form the broader national movement. New York City is often referred to as the \"birthplace\" of the Black Arts Movement, because it was home to many revolutionary Black artists and activists. However, the geographical diversity of the movement opposes the misconception that New York (and Harlem, especially) was the primary site of the movement.\n\nIn its beginning states, the movement came together largely through printed media. Journals such as \"Liberator\", \"The Crusader\", and \"Freedomways\" created \"a national community in which ideology and aesthetics were debated and a wide range of approaches to African-American artistic style and subject displayed.\" These publications tied communities outside of large Black Arts centers to the movement and gave the general black public access to these sometimes exclusive circles.\n\nAs a literary movement, Black Arts had its roots in groups such as the Umbra Workshop. Umbra (1962) was a collective of young Black writers based in Manhattan's Lower East Side; major members were writers Steve Cannon, Tom Dent, Al Haynes, David Henderson, Calvin C. Hernton, Joe Johnson, Norman Pritchard, Lennox Raphael, Ishmael Reed, Lorenzo Thomas, James Thompson, Askia M. Touré (Roland Snellings; also a visual artist), Brenda Walcott, and musician-writer Archie Shepp. Touré, a major shaper of \"cultural nationalism,\" directly influenced Jones. Along with Umbra writer Charles Patterson and Charles's brother, William Patterson, Touré joined Jones, Steve Young, and others at BARTS.\n\nUmbra, which produced \"Umbra Magazine\", was the first post-civil rights Black literary group to make an impact as radical in the sense of establishing their own voice distinct from, and sometimes at odds with, the prevailing white literary establishment. The attempt to merge a black-oriented activist thrust with a primarily artistic orientation produced a classic split in Umbra between those who wanted to be activists and those who thought of themselves as primarily writers, though to some extent all members shared both views. Black writers have always had to face the issue of whether their work was primarily political or aesthetic. Moreover, Umbra itself had evolved out of similar circumstances: in 1960 a Black nationalist literary organization, On Guard for Freedom, had been founded on the Lower East Side by Calvin Hicks. Its members included Nannie and Walter Bowe, Harold Cruse (who was then working on \"The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual\", 1967), Tom Dent, Rosa Guy, Joe Johnson, LeRoi Jones, and Sarah E. Wright, among others. On Guard was active in a famous protest at the United Nations of the American-sponsored Bay of Pigs Cuban invasion and was active in support of the Congolese liberation leader Patrice Lumumba. From On Guard, Dent, Johnson, and Walcott along with Hernton, Henderson, and Touré established Umbra.\n\nAnother formation of black writers at that time was the Harlem Writers Guild, led by John O. Killens, which included Maya Angelou, Jean Carey Bond, Rosa Guy, and Sarah Wright among others. But the Harlem Writers Guild focused on prose, primarily fiction, which did not have the mass appeal of poetry performed in the dynamic vernacular of the time. Poems could be built around anthems, chants, and political slogans, and thereby used in organizing work, which was not generally the case with novels and short stories. Moreover, the poets could and did publish themselves, whereas greater resources were needed to publish fiction. That Umbra was primarily poetry- and performance-oriented established a significant and classic characteristic of the movement's aesthetics.\nWhen Umbra split up, some members, led by Askia Touré and Al Haynes, moved to Harlem in late 1964 and formed the nationalist-oriented Uptown Writers Movement, which included poets Yusef Rahman, Keorapetse \"Willie\" Kgositsile from South Africa, and Larry Neal. Accompanied by young \"New Music\" musicians, they performed poetry all over Harlem. Members of this group joined LeRoi Jones in founding BARTS.\n\nJones's move to Harlem was short-lived. In December 1965 he returned to his home, Newark (N.J.), and left BARTS in serious disarray. BARTS failed but the Black Arts center concept was irrepressible, mainly because the Black Arts movement was so closely aligned with the then-burgeoning Black Power movement.\nThe mid-to-late 1960s was a period of intense revolutionary ferment. Beginning in 1964, rebellions in Harlem and Rochester, New York, initiated four years of long hot summers. Watts, Detroit, Newark, Cleveland, and many other cities went up in flames, culminating in nationwide explosions of resentment and anger following Martin Luther King, Jr.'s April 1968 assassination.\n\nNathan Hare, author of \"The Black Anglo-Saxons\" (1965), was the founder of 1960s Black Studies. Expelled from Howard University, Hare moved to San Francisco State University, where the battle to establish a Black Studies department was waged during a five-month strike during the 1968–69 school year. As with the establishment of Black Arts, which included a range of forces, there was broad activity in the Bay Area around Black Studies, including efforts led by poet and professor Sarah Webster Fabio at Merrit College.\n\nThe initial thrust of Black Arts ideological development came from the Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM), a national organization with a strong presence in New York City. Both Touré and Neal were members of RAM. After RAM, the major ideological force shaping the Black Arts movement was the US (as opposed to \"them\") organization led by Maulana Karenga. Also ideologically important was Elijah Muhammad's Chicago-based Nation of Islam. These three formations provided both style and conceptual direction for Black Arts artists, including those who were not members of these or any other political organization. Although the Black Arts Movement is often considered a New York-based movement, two of its three major forces were located outside New York City.\n\nAs the movement matured, the two major locations of Black Arts' ideological leadership, particularly for literary work, were California's Bay Area because of the \"Journal of Black Poetry\" and \"The Black Scholar\", and the Chicago–Detroit axis because of \"Negro Digest/Black World\" and Third World Press in Chicago, and Broadside Press and Naomi Long Madgett's Lotus Press in Detroit. The only major Black Arts literary publications to come out of New York were the short-lived (six issues between 1969 and 1972) \"Black Theatre\" magazine, published by the New Lafayette Theatre, and \"Black Dialogue\", which had actually started in San Francisco (1964–68) and relocated to New York (1969–72).\n\nAlthough the journals and writing of the movement greatly characterized its success, the movement placed a great deal of importance on collective oral and performance art. Public collective performances drew a lot of attention to the movement, and it was often easier to get an immediate response from a collective poetry reading, short play, or street performance than it was from individual performances.\n\nThe people involved in the Black Arts Movement used the arts as a way to liberate themselves. The movement served as a catalyst for many different ideas and cultures to come alive. This was a chance for African Americans to express themselves in a way that most would not have expected.\n\nIn 1967 LeRoi Jones visited Karenga in Los Angeles and became an advocate of Karenga's philosophy of Kawaida. Kawaida, which produced the \"Nguzo Saba\" (seven principles), Kwanzaa, and an emphasis on African names, was a multifaceted, categorized activist philosophy. Jones also met Bobby Seale and Eldridge Cleaver and worked with a number of the founding members of the Black Panthers. Additionally, Askia Touré was a visiting professor at San Francisco State and was to become a leading (and long-lasting) poet as well as, arguably, the most influential poet-professor in the Black Arts movement. Playwright Ed Bullins and poet Marvin X had established Black Arts West, and Dingane Joe Goncalves had founded the \"Journal of Black Poetry\" (1966). This grouping of Ed Bullins, Dingane Joe Goncalves, LeRoi Jones, Sonia Sanchez, Askia M. Touré, and Marvin X became a major nucleus of Black Arts leadership.\n\nAs the movement grew, ideological conflicts arose and eventually became too great for the movement to continue to exist as a large, coherent collective.\n\nMany discussions of the Black Arts movement posit it as the \"aesthetic and spiritual sister of the Black Power concept.\" The Black Aesthetic refers to ideologies and perspectives of art that center on Black culture and life. This Black Aesthetic encouraged the idea of Black separatism, and in trying to facilitate this, hoped to further strengthen black ideals, solidarity, and creativity.\n\nIn his well-known essay on the Black Arts Movement, Larry Neal attests: \"When we speak of a 'Black aesthetic' several things are meant. First, we assume that there is already in existence the basis for such an aesthetic. Essentially, it consists of an African-American cultural tradition. But this aesthetic is finally, by implication, broader than that tradition. It encompasses most of the usable elements of the Third World culture. The motive behind the Black aesthetic is the destruction of the white thing, the destruction of white ideas, and white ways of looking at the world.\"\n\nAmiri Baraka's poem \"Black Art\" serves as one of his most controversial, yet poetically profound supplements to the Black Arts Movement. In this piece, Baraka merges politics with art, criticizing poems that are not useful to or adequately representative of the Black struggle. First published in 1966, a period particularly known for the Civil Rights Movement, the political aspect of this piece underscores the need for a concrete and artistic approach to the realistic nature involving racism and injustice. Serving as the recognized artistic component to and having roots in the Civil Rights Movement, the Black Arts Movement aims to grant a political voice to black artists (including poets, dramatists, writers, musicians, etc.). Playing a vital role in this movement, Baraka calls out what he considers to be unproductive and assimilatory actions shown by political leaders during the Civil Rights Movement. He describes prominent Black leaders as being \"on the steps of the white house...kneeling between the sheriff's thighs negotiating coolly for his people.\" Baraka also presents issues of euro-centric mentality, by referring to Elizabeth Taylor as a prototypical model in a society that influences perceptions of beauty, emphasizing its influence on individuals of white and black ancestry. Baraka aims his message toward the Black community, with the purpose of coalescing African Americans into a unified movement, devoid of white influences. \"Black Art\" serves as a medium for expression meant to strengthen that solidarity and creativity, in terms of the Black Aesthetic. Baraka believes poems should \"shoot…come at you, love what you are\" and not succumb to mainstream desires.\n\nHe ties this approach into the emergence of hip-hop, which he paints as a movement that presents \"live words…and live flesh and coursing blood.\" Baraka's cathartic structure and aggressive tone are comparable to the beginnings of hip-hop music, which created controversy in the realm of mainstream acceptance, because of its \"authentic, un-distilled, unmediated forms of contemporary black urban music.\" Baraka believes that integration inherently takes away from the legitimacy of having a Black identity and Aesthetic in an anti-Black world. Through pure and unapologetic blackness, and with the absence of white influences, Baraka believes a black world can be achieved. Though hip-hop has been serving as a recognized salient musical form of the Black Aesthetic, a history of unproductive integration is seen across the spectrum of music, beginning with the emergence of a newly formed narrative in mainstream appeal in the 1950s. Much of Baraka's cynical disillusionment with unproductive integration can be drawn from the 50s, a period of rock and roll, in which \"record labels actively sought to have white artists \"cover\" songs that were popular on the rhythm-and-blues charts\" originally performed by African-American artists. The problematic nature of unproductive integration is also exemplified by Run-DMC, an American hip-hop group founded in 1981, who became widely accepted after a calculated collaboration with the rock group Aerosmith on a remake of the latter's \"Walk This Way\" took place in 1986, evidently appealing to young white audiences. Hip-hop emerged as an evolving genre of music that continuously challenged mainstream acceptance, most notably with the development of rap in the 1990s. A significant and modern example of this is Ice Cube, a well-known American rapper, songwriter, and actor, who introduced subgenre of hip-hop known as \"gangsta rap,\" merged social consciousness and political expression with music. With the 1960s serving as a more blatantly racist period of time, Baraka notes the revolutionary nature of hip-hop, grounded in the unmodified expression through art. This method of expression in music parallels significantly with Baraka's ideals presented in \"Black Art,\" focusing on poetry that is also productively and politically driven.\n\n\"The Revolutionary Theatre\" is a 1965 essay by Baraka that was an important contribution to the Black Arts Movement, discussing the need for change through literature and theater arts. He says: \"We will scream and cry, murder, run through the streets in agony, if it means some soul will be moved, moved to actual life understanding of what the world is, and what it ought to be.\" Baraka wrote his poetry, drama, fiction and essays in a way that would shock and awaken audiences to the political concerns of black Americans, which says much about what he was doing with this essay. It also did not seem coincidental to him that Malcolm X and John F. Kennedy had been assassinated within a few years, since Baraka believed that every voice of change in America had been murdered, which led to the writing that would come out of the Black Arts Movement.\n\nIn his essay, Baraka says: \"The Revolutionary Theatre is shaped by the world, and moves to reshape the world, using as its force the natural force and perpetual vibrations of the mind in the world. We are history and desire, what we are, and what any experience can make us.\"\n\nWith his thought-provoking ideals and references to a euro-centric society, he imposes the notion that black Americans should stray from a white aesthetic in order to find a black identity. In his essay, he says: \"The popular white man's theatre like the popular white man's novel shows tired white lives, and the problems of eating white sugar, or else it herds bigcaboosed blondes onto huge stages in rhinestones and makes believe they are dancing or singing.\" This, having much to do with a white aesthetic, further proves what was popular in society and even what society had as an example of what everyone should aspire to be, like the \"bigcaboosed blondes\" that went \"onto huge stages in rhinestones\". Furthermore, these blondes made believe they were \"dancing and singing\" which Baraka seems to be implying that white people dancing is not what dancing is supposed to be at all. These allusions bring forth the question of where black Americans fit in the public eye. Baraka says: \"We are preaching virtue and feeling, and a natural sense of the self in the world. All men live in the world, and the world ought to be a place for them to live.\" Baraka's essay challenges the idea that there is no space in politics or in society for black Americans to make a difference through different art forms that consist of, but are not limited to, poetry, song, dance, and art. \n\nAccording to the Academy of American Poets, \"many writers--Native Americans, Latinos/as, gays and lesbians, and younger generations of African Americans have acknowledged their debt to the Black Arts Movement.\" The movement lasted for about a decade, through the mid-1960s and into the 1970s. This was a period of controversy and change in the world of literature. One major change came through in the portrayal of new ethnic voices in the United States. English-language literature, prior to the Black Arts Movement, was dominated by white authors.\n\nAfrican Americans became a greater presence not only in the field of literature but in all areas of the arts. Theater groups, poetry performances, music and dance were central to the movement. Through different forms of media, African Americans were able to educate others about the expression of cultural differences and viewpoints. In particular, black poetry readings allowed African Americans to use vernacular dialogues. This was shown in the Harlem Writers Guild, which included black writers such as Maya Angelou and Rosa Guy. These performances were used to express political slogans and as a tool for organization. Theater performances also were used to convey community issues and organizations. The theaters, as well as cultural centers, were based throughout America and were used for community meetings, study groups and film screenings. Newspapers were a major tool in spreading the Black Arts Movement. In 1964, \"Black Dialogue\" was published, making it the first major Arts movement publication.\n\nThe Black Arts Movement, although short, is essential to the history of the United States. It spurred political activism and use of speech throughout every African-American community. It allowed African Americans the chance to express their voices in the mass media as well as become involved in communities.\n\nIt can be argued that \"the Black Arts movement produced some of the most exciting poetry, drama, dance, music, visual art, and fiction of the post-World War II United States\" and that many important \"post-Black artists\" such as Toni Morrison, Ntozake Shange, Alice Walker, and August Wilson were shaped by the movement.\n\nThe Black Arts Movement also provided incentives for public funding of the arts and increased public support of various arts initiatives.\n\n\nThe Arts Council of England's (ACE) Decibel initiative produced a summary in 2003 in association with \"The Guardian\" newspaper.\n\nAn international exhibition, \"Back to Black — Art, Cinema and the Racial Imaginary\", was held at the Whitechapel Gallery in 2005.\n\nA 2006 major conference \"Should Black Art Still Be Beautiful?\", organized by OOM Gallery and Midwest, examined the development of contemporary Black cultural practice and its future in Britain. On April 1, 2006, New Art Gallery, Walsall, UK, held a conference in honour of the late Donald Rodney.\n\n\"Gallery 32 and Its Circle\", a 2009 art exhibition hosted at Loyola Mount University's Laband Art Gallery, featured artwork displayed the eponymous gallery, which featured black artists in the Los Angeles area and played an integral role in the Black Arts movement in the area.\n\nA recently redeveloped African and Asian Visual Arts Archive is located at the University of East London (UEL).\n\n\n"}

It is recognized as the oldest theater in the state and among the oldest continuously operating theaters in the United States. The theater was designated as a Michigan Historic Site on March 2, 1976 and later added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Adrian Union Hall-Croswell Opera House on April 18, 1985.\n\nThe Croswell Opera House, or Adrian Union Hall as it was originally called, was completed in 1866. It was financed by the Adrian Union Hall Company, whose stockholders included future Michigan governor Charles Croswell. Its first public event, taking place on March 19, was a lecture by temperance advocate John Bartholomew Gough.\n\nThe hall served many functions during its early years. It hosted concerts, lectures, festivals, and theatrical performances by both traveling troupes and amateur local groups. Famous speakers who visited the opera house included Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Frederick Douglass, Thomas Nast, Henry Ward Beecher, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. During the 19th century it hosted performances by Edwin Booth, John Philip Sousa, and Buffalo Bill Cody; the early 20th century saw appearances by Mrs. Patrick Campbell and Maude Adams.\n\nThe Croswell has gone by many different names. During its first few years of operation, the local newspaper usually referred to it as \"New Hall.\" Around 1869, it started to be called the Opera House. When Charles Croswell retired as governor in 1881, he returned to Adrian and began buying up shares in the Adrian Union Hall Company, eventually becoming the majority shareholder; he then tasked his son, Charles Croswell Jr., with managing the theater. At this time it became known as Croswell's Opera House. Charles Croswell Jr. gave up the manager's job after his father's death in 1886, but although the possessive was dropped, the name stuck.\n\nA new lobby was added to the original building in 1882. In 1885, the theater's first electric lights were installed — just two of them — and the entire theater was outfitted for electricity in 1895. The lighting apparatus was designed by Harry A. Fee, who is better known for creating Hidden Lake Gardens in nearby Franklin Township. In 1896, to meet the demands of that era's increasingly elaborate theatrical productions, the stage was expanded and the roof above the stage raised.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the Croswell faced increasing competition from movie theaters. It was purchased in 1919 by Harry Angell and Robert Codd, who undertook two major renovations. The first, in 1919, converted the Croswell into a movie house. A long arcade-style lobby was added to the front of the building, as was a projection booth. Then, in 1921, the original balcony was torn out and replaced and the entire auditorium remodeled. It was during this renovation that the Croswell's interior took on its modern appearance.\n\nThe Croswell was leased in 1927 by Butterfield Theatres, which would continue to operate it for the next 40 years. It was wired for sound in 1929; the first talking picture shown was \"Weary River\".\n\nDuring World War II, the Croswell raised more than $1 million for the war effort by holding \"war bond premieres.\" The management would bring in a popular new film, and tickets were not for sale; only a newly purchased war bond would entitle a person to admission. Charity toy drives and children's food matinees were also common.\n\nBy the 1960s, however, the Croswell faced increasing competition from drive-in theaters and television. A theater with about 1,000 seats — the Croswell's capacity at the time — but only one screen was impractical to operate. In March 1967, the Butterfield chain announced it would not renew its lease, and owner Harry Angell put the building up for sale. The last movie of the Butterfield era, \"The Sound of Music\", closed on September 16, 1967.\n\nWith Butterfield's decision to pull out, the Croswell was in danger of being demolished. But Charlie Hickman, the owner of local manufacturing company Brazeway, stepped forward to buy the building, and a new nonprofit organization was chartered to take over its operation. The newly revived Croswell staged its first summer season of live theater in 1968, beginning with a production of Neil Simon's \"Barefoot in the Park\". This was followed by \"Summer and Smoke\", \"Oliver!\", and \"Once More, With Feeling\".\n\nThat fall, a new group, the Croswell Players, was formed to continue offering theater during the fall, winter and spring. Eventually, the Croswell's summer and winter theater programs would merge.\n\nIn 1970, the tradition of bringing high-profile speakers to Adrian to speak at the Croswell was revived. Speakers in the theater's Town Hall series, which ran from 1970 to 1996, included Gloria Steinem, Helen Thomas, Arianna Huffington, Ralph Nader, Julian Bond, Art Linkletter, Jeane Dixon, Bella Abzug, Kitty Carlisle, Charlton Heston, and \"Dear Abby\" author Pauline Phillips.\n\nA capital campaign to renovate the theater was announced in May 2015, with changes to include new public spaces, more restrooms, Americans with Disabilities Act improvements, and electrical and other infrastructure upgrades. Construction began in 2016 and the theater reopened in May 2017.\n\nThe 2017 season will mark the Croswell's 50th summer as a producing theater.\n\nThe Croswell was originally designed by Horatio Nelson White. In 1865, while the theater was still under construction, a correspondent for the Detroit Free Press visited Adrian and gave this description:During this season, notwithstanding the high wages, cost of lumber and all building materials, there have been many fine buildings, dwellinghouses and stores erected. The first one particularly attracting attention on entering the city from the depot is “Union Hall,” a large brick structure erected and owned by a joint-stock company at a cost of $35,000. This building is located on the lower end of Maumee street, and fronts directly on it. It is one hundred and fifteen feet and ten inches deep, by sixty-four feet and four inches wide, and built of such a height that the main hall will finish thirty-two feet in the clear. The principal audience room is at some little distance from the street, and is reached through an arched passage-way, on each side of which is an elegant and commodious store. It is eighty feet in depth and sixty-three feet wide, with a gallery on three sides containing three rows of seats, calculated to seat with comfort fifteen hundred people. In the erection of the gallery a new feature is introduced, which, by means of trusses, braces and iron ties, makes it self-supporting, and entirely does away with the necessity of columns or ungainly brackets to support it. There is a large stage, 30x32 feet, which is fitted up for theatrical exhibitions, with scenery, dressing-rooms, &c. In the arrangement of the scenery, some new ideas are carried out, several of the side scenes folding up, while the principal fines, five in number, are suspended from large cylinders overhead, being hoisted and lowered by means of machinery, completely doing away with the squeaking, rattling and confusion generally attendant upon the shifting and sliding of the different pieces, and as a whole scene is raised or lowered at once, the ridiculous gap often seen in the center of an elegant painting is obviated. In the basement are the furnaces for heating the building, a large storeroom capable of containing all the seats of the hall, when it is cleared for the benefit of those tripping the “light fantastic toe,” and a large dining room, which extends the entire length of the building. The ceiling and walls are to be frescoed, and if finished according to design, will present an elegant and tasteful appearance, reflecting much credit on the designers and owners, and the city. In the erection of the structure there is no attempt at the gaudy or gorgeous, everything in and about it is plain, sold \"[sic.]\" and substantial. It was designed by H. N. White, of Syracuse, New York, and erected under the supervision of Mr. Smith, a master-builder of this city.Writing some time later, local historian R.I. Bonner reported that the Croswell was patterned after Wieting Hall in Syracuse.\n\nThe physical appearance of the Croswell changed several times over the course of the 19th century. A 14-foot addition was built on the front of the theater in 1882, and the stage roof was raised in 1896 to accommodate more elaborate scenery.\n\nThe 1919 and 1921 renovations were directed by architect J.C. Brompton, who also designed the Riviera Theatre in Three Rivers. In 1919, a projection booth was built onto the front of the building and a long arcade-style lobby was added; previously, patrons had to walk down a long alley from Maumee Street and wait outdoors before a show. In 1921, the original horseshoe-shaped balcony was torn out and replaced and the entire interior of the theater was redesigned.\n\nSome of the theater's distinctive features include ornate plaster detailing around the entire auditorium, two tall organ towers on either side of the stage with decorate urns built into them, and large panels on the walls reminiscent of the ones that can be seen in Brompton's RIviera Theatre.\n\nFrom 1921 until the 1970s, only minor changes were made to the Croswell's interior. In 1976, an addition was built on the back of the theater for a scene shop and offices. Two buildings on either side of the Croswell's front lobby were purchased in 1978 and 1979 and added to the theater, becoming space for rehearsals, offices and an art gallery.\n\nThe theater was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.\n\nThe Croswell is a producing theater and operates year-round, staging six to eight full-scale musicals per year, along with straight plays, children's theater, and occasional concerts. It is owned by the Croswell Opera House and Fine Arts Association, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. Its artistic director since 2009 is Jere Righter.\n\nThe majority of shows produced at the Croswell are musicals. A live orchestra, rather than recorded music, is employed for all of the theater's full-length musicals.\n\nThe Croswell's 2017 season will include \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\", \"In the\" \"Heights\", \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\", \"Beauty and the Beast\", and \"Meet Me in St. Louis\".\n\nIn addition to established works, the Croswell has premiered several new plays and musicals, including:\nAnother new play, \"Family Digs\", will be produced in October 2017.\n\nThe Croswell offers a number of educational programs, including summer performance and technical theater camps, an all-area high school musical, paid summer internships for college students, and a variety of children's performances.\n\nTheater professionals with a Croswell background include:\n\n"}

With only the sparest of plots, these tales often depend upon repetition and rhythm for their effect, and can require a skilled storyteller to negotiate their tongue-twisting repetitions in performance. The climax is sometimes abrupt and sobering as in \"The Gingerbread Man.\" The device often takes the form of a cumulative song or nursery rhyme. Many cumulative tales feature a series of animals or forces of nature each more powerful than the last.\n\nCumulative tales have a long pedigree. In an early Jewish Midrash, considered to date from the sixth century AD, Abraham is brought before King Nimrod, who commands him to worship fire. Abraham replies that it would be more reasonable to worship water, which can quench fire and is therefore more powerful. When this premise is granted, he points out that the clouds, as sustainers of water, are more worthy of worship, and then that the wind that disperses them is more powerful still. Finally he confronts Nimrod with the observation that \"man can stand up against the wind or shield himself behind the walls of his house\" (Genesis Rabba xxxviii).\n\nThere is a similar tale, The Mouse Turned into a Maid, in the Panchatantra, in which the mouse-maid is successively introduced to the sun, the cloud, the wind and the mountain. She prefers each in turn as stronger than the last, but finally a mouse is found to be stronger than even the mountain, and so she marries the mouse. Stories of this type, such as the Japanese The Husband of the Rat's Daughter, are widely diffused.\n\nIn the Aarne-Thompson classification system, types 2000-2100 are all cumulative tales, including:\n\n\n\n"}

They are inspired by the Delphic Games of ancient Greece.\n\nOne of the four Panhellenic Games were the Pythian Games in Delphi. Held every four years, they included competitions in athletics, theatre, music, poetry, and painting to praise the god Apollo, the symbol of the Oracle. In the year 394 A.D., Theodosius I, the emperor of the Byzantine Empire banned all Panhellenic Games as being pagan events.\n\nSince 1912 till 1948, on the initiative of Pierre de Coubertin, art competitions at the Summer Olympics were held in various countries. Medals were awarded for works related solely to sport.\n\nThere was also an attempt to revive Pythian Games at the archeological site of Delphi, at the initiative by the Greek poet Angelos Sikelianos and his wife Eva Palmer. In 1927, the first Delphic Festival was held in Greece, but the revival was then abandoned.\n\nNowadays there are so-called Delphi Festivals, which are the closest to their Panhellenic counterparts. They include religious rituals and activities like poetry competition, religious offerings, sports and of course feasting.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, there was another attempt to restore Delphic Games. Since the 1990s, representatives from Argentina, Austria, China, Cyprus, Ecuador, France, Germany, Greece, Kazakhstan, Libya, Lithuania, Mexico, Nigeria, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, and the United States came together and organized First International Delphic Games, which took place in 2000 in Moscow, Russia (before that the concept was tested out in Tbilisi, Georgia, where First Junior Delphic Games took place.)\n\nCurrently, there are two organizations conducting Delphic Games.\n\nThe International Delphic Council (IDC) with headquarters in Berlin was founded in 1994 at the Schönhausen Palace. Since 1995 the IDC actively supports the creation of the National Delphic organizations. Since 1997 the IDC has organized the International Youth Delphic Games in Georgia, Germany, Philippines, South Africa, as well as, since 2000, the International Delphic Games for adult participants in Russia, Malaysia, South Korea. The IDC held Delphic Games and Junior Delphic Games in the four-year cycle, two years offset from one another, such as the Olympic Games, held at different locations in the world. The International Delphic Games and Congresses receive greetings, patronage and support from various international organizations and celebrities.\n\nA newer organization, International Delphic Committee (IDC) with headquarters in Moscow, was registered in 2004. It organizes International Delphic Games, Youth Delphic Games of Russia and Youth Delphic Games of CIS. Since 2005 the Junior Delphic Games in Russia and the Junior Delphic Games in Commonwealth of Independent States are conducted by the International Delphic Committee. These Junior Delphic Games are dedicated to significant domestic events. This International Delphic Committee conducted also in September 2008 the Second International Delphic Games in Saratov / Russia, but some Saratov Sunday editions and news portals questioned the status and legitimacy of the games.\n\nUnder the patronage of the International Delphic Committee (headquartered in Moscow) and UNESCO, the First Open Youth European Delphic Games were held in Volgograd, Russia, on May 2–7, 2014.\n\n"}
{"id": "34814189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34814189", "title": "Disability art", "text": "Disability art\n\nDisability art or disability arts is any art, theatre, fine arts, film, writing, music that takes disability as its theme or whose context relates to disability.\n\nDisability arts is an area of art where the context of the art takes on disability as its theme. Disability art is about exploring the conceptual ideas and physical realities of what it is like to be disabled or concepts relating to the word.\n\nDisability art is different from Disability in the arts which refers more to the active participation or representation of disabled people in the arts rather than the context of the work being about disability. Disability art does not require the maker of the art to be disabled (see Disability Arts in the Disability Arts Movement for the exception) nor does art made by a disabled person automatically become disability art just because it was a disabled person that made it. \n\nAn example of disability art by a non-disabled person: \"Alison Lapper Pregnant\", 2005, Marc Quinn is disability art because of its context as he reveals the concept of the work was to make \"the ultimate statement about disability\" \n\nAn example of disability art by a disabled person: \"effective, defective, creative\", 2000, Yinka Shonibare, shows photos of foetuses from women deemed to be at risk of delivering a defective baby, therefore looking at the relationship of defectiveness and disability. \n\nAn example of art made by a disabled person that is not disability art: \"Dorothea\", 1995, Chuck Close; relates to his \"strict adherence to the self-imposed rules that have guided his art\" and \"formal analysis and methodological reconfiguration of the human face\" therefore conceptually has nothing to do with disability therefore is not disability art.\n\nDisability art is a concept which was developed out of the disability arts movement. In the disability arts movement disability art stood for \"art made by disabled people which reflects the experience of disability.\" To be making disability art in the disability arts movement it is conditional on being a disabled person.\n\nThe development of disability art began in the 1970s / 80s as a result of the new political activism of the disabled peoples' movement. The exact date the term came into use is currently unverified, although the first use of the term in the Disability Arts Chronology is 1986. During this period the term \"disability art\" in the disability arts movement has been retrospectively agreed to mean \"art made by disabled people which reflects the experience of disability\". \n\nAs the movement and term developed, the disability arts movement began to expand from what mainly started out as disabled people's cabaret to all art forms. The disability arts movement began to grow year on year and was at its height during the late 1990s. Key exhibitions which looked at disability art happened like \"Barriers\", which was an exhibition considering physical, sensory and intellectual limitation and its effect on personal art practice. (8 Feb - 16 Mar 2007: Aspex Gallery, Portsmouth) and the creation of the Disability Film Festival in London in 1999, – both of which looked at work by disabled people as well as disability arts. \n\nDisabled people's politics in Britain was changed by the Disability Discrimination Act of 1995. In the subsequent years as people adapted to the protection of legislation a new wave of politics entered in the disability arts movement. In 2004 the revised Disability Discrimination Act signified the end of the domination of art based on discrimination politics in the disability arts movement. A new generation of disabled people were less political and carried an agenda of integration. This combined with the carers movement highlighted a change in attitude that acknowledged the work of the disability arts movement to claim the term \"disability art\" but showed a movement away from the idea that only disabled people could make disability art. It began to be recognised that disability art needs to be \"supported by society itself and not just by disabled people\".\n\nIn 2007 the London Disability Arts Forum held a debate at the Tate Modern on the motion 'Should disability and Deaf art be dead and buried in the 21st Century?' produced in response to arts cuts from the Arts Council faced by disabled-led arts organisations at the time. This debate has become significant in the way Melvin Bragg's article highlighted how disability art like Marc Quinn's sculpture Alison Lapper Pregnant raise the profile of disability in the arts. This debate and subsequent article set in motion a change for many people to recognise that the new generation of disabled people and artists did not feel it necessary to control the term disability arts but to open it out for a wider view on disability. \n\nVery few people are aware of disability as a topic of art, mainly due to the lack of accessible and cohesive academic work and publications around the subjects of disability art and the disability arts movement. It has yet to enter into the art curriculum or establish itself as a strongly recognised concept in the arts – so development of the subject needs much more work for it to justify its place as a relevant term long term in the arts. On the other hand, in some instances, artists, curators or theorists who identify as disabled and make, curate or write about disability in their creative practices feel ambivalent about this category.\n\nIn some circles disability art is still promoted as \"art made by disabled people that reflects the experience of disability.\" This is most notably the line taken by NDACA Co-op, which is predominantly made up of members who were key to the development of the disability arts movement. Although it is more commonly accepted that non-disabled people can make valid disability art, even by people that strongly align themselves with the disability arts movement.\n\nVSA, (previously Very Special Arts), the international organization on arts and disability in the United States, was founded more than 35 years ago by Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith to provide arts and education opportunities for people with disabilities and increase access to the arts for all. With 52 international affiliates and a network of nationwide affiliates, VSA is providing arts and education programming for youth and adults with disabilities around the world.\n\nThe development of disability arts in the USA is also tied to several non-profit organizations such as Creative Growth in Oakland, CA, that serves adult artists with developmental, mental and physical disabilities, providing a professional studio environment for artistic development, gallery exhibition and representation and a social atmosphere among peers. Organizations with similar mandates in the Bay Area include Creativity Explored in San Francisco, and NIAD Art Center in Richmond http://www.niadart.org. NIAD Art Center - Nurturing Independence through Artistic Development (formerly registered as National Institute of Art & Disabilities) - was established in 1982 by the late Florence Ludins-Katz and the late Elias Katz, PhD. Many other organizations with similar visions and mandates can be found across the country.\n\nCurrently, the leading scholars in disability arts in the USA include Michael Davidson, Lennard Davis, Rosemarie Garland-Thomson, Ann Fox, Jessica Cooley, Joseph Grigely, Georgina Kleege, Petra Kuppers, Simi Linton, Ann Millett-Gallant, Amanda Cachia, David. T Mitchell, Carrie Sandahl, Susan Schweik, Tobin Siebers and Sharon L. Snyder, who write about a range of topics within disability arts, such as performance, literature, aesthetics, visual art, music, art history, theatre, film, dance, curatorial studies, and more. \n\nArtists who identify as disabled and make work about disability are growing in numbers, as are curators who identify as disabled and curate exhibitions on disability. Katherine Ott is a curator at the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institution who has curated a number of exhibits on the history of the body, disability, ethnic and folk medicine, integrative and alternative medicine, ophthalmology, plastic surgery and dermatology, medical technology, prosthetics and rehabilitation, sexuality, visual and material culture and other ephemera.\n\nNon-profit, government-funded organizations dedicated to providing resources and support towards activities in disability art are numerous in countries like Australia and Canada. In Australia, such organizations include Arts Access Australia (peak body), Accessible Arts (NSW), DADAA (WA), Arts Access Victoria (VIC) and more. In Canada, organizations include the Indefinite Arts Centre (Calgary), Arts & Disability Network Manitoba, Kickstart Arts - disability arts and culture and Tangled Gallery, showcasing Disability Art in Toronto. These organizations work to increase opportunities and access for people with disability as artists, arts-workers, participants and audiences. They offer services to their members, such as representation and advocacy, facilitation and development, information and advice, grants and more. Many of these organizations use the Social model of disability, thus they use the term ‘disability’ to refer to barriers, rather than medical conditions or impairments. They might categorize ‘people with disability’, to mean anyone with sensory or physical impairments, hidden impairments, intellectual impairments, learning difficulties or mental health conditions. These organizations recognise and value the culture and language of the Deaf community, and include them within this definition in recognition of the similar barriers that many deaf people face accessing the arts.\n\n"}

The hanging scroll was displayed in a room for appreciation; it is to be distinguished from the handscroll, which was narrower and designed to be viewed flat on a table in sections and then stored away again.\n\nHanging scrolls are generally intended to be displayed for short periods of time and are then rolled up to be tied and secured for storage. The hanging scrolls are rotated according to season or occasion, and such works are never intended to be on permanent display. The painting surface of the paper or silk can be mounted with decorative brocade silk borders. In the composition of a hanging scroll, the foreground is usually at the bottom of the scroll while the middle and far distances are at the middle and top respectively.\n\nThe traditional craft involved in creating a hanging scroll is considered an art in itself. Mountings for Chinese paintings can be divided into a few types, such as handscrolls, hanging scrolls, album leaves, and screens amongst others. In the hanging scroll the actual painting is mounted on paper, and provided at the top with a stave, to which is attached a hanging cord, and at the bottom with a roller.\n\nScrolls originated in their earliest form from literature and other texts written on bamboo strips and silk banners across ancient China. The earliest hanging scrolls are related to and developed from silk banners in early Chinese history. These banners were long and hung vertically on walls. Such silk banners and hanging scroll paintings were found at Mawangdui dating back to the Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE). By the time of the Tang Dynasty (618–907), the aesthetic and structural objectives for hanging scrolls were summarized, which are still followed to this day. During the early Song Dynasty (960–1279), the scrolls became well suited to the art styles of the artists, consequently hanging scrolls were made in many different sizes and proportions.\n\nOriginally introduced to Japan from China as a means of spreading Buddhism, it has found a place in Japanese culture and art and plays an important role in interior decoration.\n\nThe hanging scroll provides an artist with a vertical format to display his art on a wall. It is one of the most common types of scrolls for Chinese painting and calligraphy. Horizontal hanging scrolls are also very frequently used and a common form. The hanging scroll is different from the handscroll in that the latter is not hung. The handscroll is a long narrow scroll for displaying a series of scenes in Chinese painting. This scroll is intended to be viewed section for section during the unrolling and flat on a table, which is in contrast to a hanging scroll that is appreciated in its entirety while guiding the eyes through the artwork.\n\nThere are several hanging scroll styles for mounting, such as:\n\nBesides the previous styles of hanging scroll mountings, there are a few additional ways to format the hanging scroll.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChinese mounting and conservation techniques are considered a traditional craft and are believed to have developed around 2,000 years ago. This craft is considered an art onto itself. Careful attention was and still is paid to ensure the quality and variety of the silk and paper to protect and properly fit the artwork onto the mounting, as it gives form to the art. The art is fixed onto a four-sided inlay, made from paper or silk, thus providing a border.\n\nThe artwork in the middle of the scroll is called \"huaxin\" (畫心; literally \"painted heart\"). There is sometimes a section above the artwork called a \"shitang\" (詩塘; literally \"poetic pool\"), which is usually reserved for inscriptions onto the work of art, ranging from a short verse to poems and other inscriptions. These inscriptions are often done by people other than the artist. Although inscriptions can also be placed onto the material of the artwork itself. The upper part of the scroll is called \"tiantou\" (天頭; symbolizing \"Heaven\") and the lower part is called \"ditou\" (地頭; symbolizing \"Earth\").\n\nAt the top of the scroll is a thin wooden bar, called \"tiangan\" (天杆), on which a cord is attached for hanging the scroll. Two decorative strips, called \"jingyan\" (惊燕; literally \"frighten swallows\"), are sometimes attached to the top of the scroll. At the bottom of the scroll is a wooden cylindrical bar, called \"digan\" (地杆), attached to give the scroll the necessary weight to hang properly onto a wall, but it also serves to roll up a scroll for storage when the artwork is not in display. \nThe two knobs at the far ends of the lower wooden bar are called \"zhoutou\" (軸頭) and help to ease the rolling of the scroll. These could be ornamented with a variety of materials, such as jade, ivory, or horn.\n\nTraditional scroll mounters go through a lengthy process of backing the mounting silks with paper using paste before creating the borders for the scroll. Afterwards, the whole scroll is backed before the roller and fittings are attached. The whole process can take two weeks to nine months depending on how long the scroll is left on the wall to dry and stretch before finishing by polishing the back with Chinese wax and fitting the rod and roller at either end. This process is generally called 'wet mounting' due to the use of wet paste in the process.\n\nIn the late 20th century a new method was created called 'dry mounting' which involves the use of heat activated silicone sheets in lieu of paste which reduced the amount of time from a few weeks to just a few hours. This new method is generally used for mass-produced artwork rather than serious art or conservation as mounting done this way tends not to be as robust as wet mounting whose scrolls can last for over a century before it requires remounting.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1871172", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1871172", "title": "Hereford Mappa Mundi", "text": "Hereford Mappa Mundi\n\nThe Hereford Mappa Mundi is a medieval map of the known world (mappa mundi in Latin), of a form deriving from the T and O pattern, dating from c. 1300. It is displayed at Hereford Cathedral in Hereford, England. It is the largest medieval map still known to exist.\n\nThe Hereford Mappa Mundi hung, with little regard, for many years on a wall of a choir aisle in the cathedral. During the troubled times of the Commonwealth the map had been laid beneath the floor of Bishop Audley's Chantry, where it remained secreted for some time. In 1855 it was cleaned and repaired at the British Museum. During the Second World War, for safety reasons, the mappa mundi and other valuable manuscripts from Hereford Cathedral Library were kept elsewhere and returned to the collection in 1946.\n\nIn 1988, a financial crisis in the Diocese of Hereford caused the Dean and Chapter to propose selling the mappa mundi. After much controversy, large donations from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, Paul Getty and members of the public kept the map in Hereford and allowed the construction of a new library to house the map and the chained libraries from the Cathedral and All Saints' Church. The new Library Building in the south east corner of the cathedral close opened in 1996. An open-access high-resolution digital image of the map with more than 1,000 place and name annotations is included among the thirteen medieval maps of the world edited in the Virtual Mappa project.\n\nDrawn on a single sheet of vellum, it measures 158 cm by 133 cm, some in diameter and is the largest medieval map known still to exist. The writing is in black ink, with additional red and gold, and blue or green for water (with the Red Sea (8) coloured red). It depicts 420 towns, 15 Biblical events, 33 animals and plants, 32 people, and five scenes from classical mythology.\n\nJerusalem is drawn at the centre of the circle; east is on top, showing the Garden of Eden in a circle at the edge of the world (1). Great Britain is drawn at the northwestern border (bottom left, 22 & 23). Curiously, the labels for Africa and Europe are reversed, with Europe scribed in red and gold as \"Africa\", and vice versa.\n\nThe map is based on traditional accounts and earlier maps such as the one of the Beatus of Liébana codex, and is very similar to the Ebstorf map, the Psalter world map, and the \"Sawley\" (erroneously for considerable time called \"Henry of Mainz\") map; it does not correspond to the geographical knowledge of the 14th century. Note, for example, that the Caspian Sea (5) connects to the encircling ocean (upper left). This is in spite of William of Rubruk's having reported it to be landlocked in 1255, i.e. several decades before the map's creation; see also Portolan chart.\n\nThe \"T and O\" shape does not imply that its creators believed in a flat Earth. The spherical shape of the Earth was already known to the ancient Greeks and Romans and the idea was never entirely forgotten even in the Middle Ages, and thus the circular representation may well be considered a conventional attempt at a projection: in spite of the acceptance of a spherical Earth, only the known parts of the Northern Hemisphere were believed to be inhabitable by human beings (see antipodes), so that the circular representation remained adequate. The long river on the far right is the River Nile, too (12), and the T shape is established by the Mediterranean Sea (19-21-25) and the rivers Don (13) and Nile (16). It is the first map to mention the Faroe Islands.\n\nThe map is signed by or attributed to one \"Richard of Haldingham and Lafford\", also known as Richard de Bello, \"prebend of Lafford in Lincoln Cathedral\". However, this attribution isn't completely agreed upon, it being suggested that the exquisite level of detail included in the map could not have been completed by one person. Some people believe that the map was originally created by Richard of Haldingham and Lafford and that at his death it passed to his younger cousin, Richard de Bello. Once it was in de Bello's possession, de Bello and his patron Richard Swindfield worked on the map.\n\nIt was for long believed the map was not created in Hereford. It was believed to have been made in Lincoln, since the city of Lincoln is drawn in considerable detail, being represented by a cathedral located on a hill near a river. Hereford, on the other hand, is represented only by a cathedral and seems an afterthought, drawn by a different hand than many of the other things on the map. However, more recent research, including the origin of wood used for the frame which corresponds with a compass hole in the map, suggests it may have in fact been created in or around Hereford.\n\n0 – At the centre of the map: Jerusalem, above it: the crucifix.\n1 – Paradise, surrounded by a wall and a ring of fire.

{"id": "22771176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22771176", "title": "Islamic views on sin", "text": "Islamic views on sin\n\nSin is an important concept in Islamic ethics. Muslims see sin as anything that goes against the commands of Allah (God), a breach of the laws and norms laid down by religion. Islam teaches that sin is an act and not a state of being. It is believed that Allah weighs an individual’s good deeds and against his or her sins on the Day of Judgement and punishes those individuals whose evil deeds outweigh their good deeds. These individuals are thought to be sentenced to afterlife in the fires of جهنم jahannam (Hell).\n\nThe Quran describes these sins throughout the text and demonstrates that some sins are more punishable than others. A clear distinction is made between major and minor sins (53:31–32), indicating that if an individual stays away from the major sins, then he/she will be forgiven of the minor sins. Regardless, Islam teaches that God is merciful and individuals can be forgiven of their sins if they repent.\n\nSources differ on the exact meanings of the different terms for sin used in the Islamic tradition.\n\nA number of different words for sin are used in the Islamic tradition.\n\nAccording to A.J. Wensinck's entry in the Encyclopedia of Islam, Islamic terms for sin include \"dhanb\" and \"khaṭīʾa\", which are synonymous and refer to intentional sins; \"khiṭʾ\", which means simply a sin; and \"ithm\", which is used for grave sins.\n\nAccording to Cyril Glasse, Islam recognizes two kinds of sin (\"khati'ah\"): \"dhanb\", a fault or shortcoming which is to be sanctioned; and \"ithm\", a willful transgression which is to be punished.\n\nSeveral different words are used in the Quran to describe sin—1) \"Dhanb\" 2) \"Ithm\" 3) \"Khati’ah\" 4) \"Jurm\" 5) \"Junah/Haraj\". By examining the choice of words in Quranic verses used in connection with these terms, scholars have attempted to determine which sins are associated with which terms.\n\n\"Dhanb\" (plural \"dhunub\") is frequently applied to heinous sins committed against God. One of the main examples of \"Dhanb\" in the Quran is of “crying lies of God’s signs”, or having excessive pride that prevents an individual from believing the signs of God.\n\nThis use of \"dhanb\" in the Quran exemplifies that this type of sin is punishable in the afterlife. In fact, \"dhanb\" is considered a ‘great’ sin and is often used in the Quran to contrast with \"sayyi’a\", which denotes a ‘smaller’ sin. The Quran states that if you avoid these great sins, your lesser evil deeds or sayyi’at will be forgiven.\n\nSome scholars believe the basic meaning of \"ithm\" to be an unlawful deed that is committed intentionally. This contrasts to \"dhanb\" in that \"dhanb\" can be both intentional and unintentional. However, this definition is somewhat nebulous and the best description of the word is based on the contextual situations. In the Quran, i\"thm\" is found quite frequently in legislative descriptions. For example, falsely accusing your own wife in order to gain money is constituted as an \"ithm\" (Quran 4: 24/20). However, \"ithm\" is also used in connection with \"haram\", or committing an unlawful deed, a taboo, such as consuming food or drink that is forbidden by God:\n\n\"Ithm\" is also associated with what is considered the worst sin of all, \"shirk\". \"Shirk\" signifies the accepting of a presence of other divinities at the side of God. The Quran states that:\n\nThis association with \"shirk\" is noteworthy for \"shirk\" is considered unforgivable if not repented of.\n\n\"Khati’ah\" is considered by many scholars to be a “moral lapse” or a “mistake” This interpretation has led some scholars to believe that \"Khati’ah\" is a lesser sin than ithm; however, the word \"Khati’ah\" is frequently used in conjunction with \"ithm\" in the Quran.\n\nThis Quranic verse indicates that \"khati’ah\" is considered an \"ithm\", a grave sin. In fact, the word \"khati’ah\" is associated with some of the most heinous religious sins in the Quran. In one Quranic verse this word is used to describe the sin of slaying one’s own children for fear of poverty. (Quran 17:33/31). Scholars believe that \"dhanb\" or \"ithm\" could be used in place of \"khati’ah\" in this instance; however, the word choice indicates that \"khati’ah\" is more than just a moral lapse or mistake and is punishable.\n\nThe word \"Jurum\" is often considered to be a synonym of dhanb for it is used to describe some of the same sins: crying lies of God and not believing the signs of God. In the Quran, the word mostly appears in the form of \"mujrim\", one who commits a \"jurm\". These individuals are described in the Quran as having arrogance towards the believers.\n\n\"Junah\" and \"Haraj\" have a similar meaning to that of \"ithm\", a sin that warrants a punishment. In fact, these words are used almost interchangeably with \"ithm\" in the same chapters in the Quran. Like \"ithm\", these words are found frequently in legislative portions of the Quran, particularly relating to regulations regarding marriage and divorce.\n\nSin is discussed extensively in the hadith, (the collection of Muhammad's sayings). It is reported by An-Nawwas bin Sam'an: \nWabisah bin Ma’bad reported: \nIn Sunan al-Tirmidhi, a Hadith is narrated:\nIn Sahih Muslim, Abu Ayyub al-Ansari and Abu Huraira narrated:\n\nThe effects of sins are so many to the extent that they are uncountable. Yet some of the effects are:\n\nThere are some sins which its ill-consequences were stated in the Qur'an and hadith, we shall quote some of them here: \n\nAccording to Islam, one can be forgiven of sins through genuine \"tawbah\" (repentance) which literally means \"to return.\"\n\nUnlike the Catholic concept of atonement, \"tawbah\" does not entail formal, eccelesiastical confession to a religious leader. Like Protestantism, Islam allows followers to repent directly to God. In addition, while Christianity and Islam considers humans as prone to sin, Islam ultimately views them as responsible for their actions and refutes the Christian concept of original sin.\n\nMore so, in Islam Muslims are discouraged from confessing their sins and sharing the wrongdoings of others.\nAlso, according to Islam, Blood sacrifice cannot add to Divine Grace nor replace the necessity of repentance. However, sacrifice is done to help the poor and to remember Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son at God's command.\nWhen a human has violated another human’s rights, ḥuqūq al-ʿibād, compensation is necessary in order to show that one has made amends.\n\nWhen a human has offended or disobeyed God, ḥuqūq Allāh, penitence, remorse, and resolution are necessary in order to show that one is sincere, and will not repeat the wrongdoing in the future.\n\nAccording to Shaddad ibn Aws:\nFrom a traditionalist perspective, sin is applied to an individual’s actions. Through belief and good works, an individual can remove his/her sin and attain God’s good favor. \nClassical legal scholar Muhammad al-Shafi'i (767 – 820) derived this understanding from Quranic passages such as:\n\nFrom a modernist perspective, sin has also been applied to a group or community’s collective behavior. Through public acknowledgement of wrongdoing, people can take responsibility for the lack of morality within their society and enact social reform. Egyptian reformer Muḥammad ʿAbduh (1849–1905) and his disciple Muḥammad Rashīd Ridā (1865–1935) derived this understanding from Quranic passages such as:\n\nOther modern reformers, such as Sayyid Qutb, held that repentance involved a renewed, holistic commitment to Islam, rather than admission of sin for the sake of being pardoned of punishment. This understanding draws from classical Sufi thought, whereby one experiences a personality transformation and his/her sinful impulses are replaced by virtue. Qutb derived this understanding from Quranic passages such as:\n\nRepentance for sin can be accomplished through acts such as, “fasting, giving charity, sacrificing an animal, and freeing a slave.” In addition, going on the hajj can serve as a form of repentance.\n\nAccording to Shaddad ibn Aws:\nHowever, regardless of one's outward deeds, God does not accept the forgiveness of those who are insincere in their repentance and only do so in order to avoid jahannam.\n\nThe most heinous sins in Islam are known as Al-Kabirah () which translates to the great or major one. Some authors use the term enormity. While every sin is seen as an offense to Allah, the al-Kaba'ir are the gravest of the offenses. Allah’s power is thought to be only eclipsed by his mercy and thus small sins are tacitly understood to be forgiven after repentance. Not every sin is equal however and some are thought to be more spiritually damning than others. The greatest of the sins described as al-Kaba'ir is the association of others with Allah or Shirk. Scholar differ as to how many major sins there are.\nIn contrasting major sins with minor sins (\"al-sagha'ir\"), the eighth-century Shafi'i scholar Al-Dhahabi found the hadith collections of Sahih al-Bukhari and Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj listed seven major sins, while the tradition from Abd Allah ibn Abbas stated that there were closer to seventy major sins.\nSome of the major or al-Kaba'ir sins in Islam are as follows:\n\n\nIt should be noted that these are only the opinion of particular scholars and do not wholly represent Islam.\n\nAlthough many of the ideas for what is unacceptable overlap, the seven major sins of Islam differs from the seven deadly sins of Christianity. The Islamic sins refer more to specific undesirable behavior rather than to the general negative characteristics or actions of the cardinal Christian sins. Despite the similar names, the seven main sins in Islam are more comparable to the Ten Commandments rather than the seven deadly sins. They both provide the bottom line for believers in terms of what is acceptable behavior in the faith. The actions themselves differ most of the major crimes in Islam relate to subservience to Allah. Any form of polytheism is seen to be the most severe offense in the religion and all of the other transgressions are in some form of association with Allah. Witchcraft, for example, is the taking on of supernatural powers in order to make the practitioner a being above the normal human. This challenges the power of Allah as the person in question has superseded their mortal position to become something greater and akin to a god. The same can be said of murder, as ultimately the power to decide who shall live and die is believed to belong solely to Allah. Life is thought to be a gift from Allah and the unjust taking of life is a severe spiritual offense, as it is not only seen as morally wrong but also as an affront to God.\n\nIn addition to what Muslim scholars agree are the principal seven sins, the idea exists that the major sins extend far past the seven. These additional transgressions, potentially up to seventy, are not universally settled upon nor are they explicitly stated in the Qur'an, however they are thought to be implied by the text. The supplementary sins as a whole lack the spiritual gravity of the original seven and include things such as drinking alcohol and eavesdropping.\n\n"}

Balfour Company, Balfour is an operating unit of Commemorative Brands, Inc., a subsidiary of American Achievement Corporation. Balfour produces high school, college, military, and championship rings, yearbooks, caps and gowns, and graduation announcements.\n\nLloyd Garfield \"Bally\" Balfour was a native of Kentucky, where he earned his B.A. degree at the University of Louisville. He went on to obtain an LL.B. degree from Indiana University, where he became a member of Sigma Chi Fraternity in 1907. Business was of greater attraction to Balfour rather than the legal profession, and he spent five years as a traveling representative for a maker of fraternity jewelry. During that time Balfour noticed several trends in the business, including lack of standardization, poor workmanship, inferior materials, and fictitious guarantees. These issues drove Mr. Balfour to establish his own company, and he founded the L.G. Balfour Company on Friday, June 13, 1913. The business grew from a small nucleus of skilled craftsmen led by Mr. Balfour in a facility in Attleboro, Massachusetts. Lloyd Balfour's wives, Ruth who died a few years after they married and Mildred, were members of Pi Beta Phi and the L.G. Balfour Company landed Pi Beta Phi as their first sorority account when the company became the official jeweler after a vote at the 1913 Pi Beta Phi Convention. In the early years, business was concentrated on quality fraternity and sorority products and the company earned a reputation for quality, integrity, and service. Eventually Balfour held contracts with ninety percent of all national fraternal societies.\n\nIn 1922, Balfour set up a new department to manufacture and sell high school class rings and insignia. In 1923, Balfour introduced the first multi-year contract plans for schools.\n\nDuring World War II, Balfour produced a variety of war-time medals and other products in support of our armed services. Shortly thereafter, Balfour manufactured the first press badge for the Boston Red Sox, beginning forty successive years of making ninety percent of all the baseball World Series press badges. Also, DuPont became the company's first major recognition products account.\n\nIn June 1961, Balfour was accused by the federal government of monopolizing the sale and distribution of fraternity and sorority jewelry and rings. The Federal Trade Commission charged that Balfour \"unreasonably foreclosed competitors and potential competitors from markets, and employed other illegal practices which have restrained trade.\" Company president Lloyd Balfour was named in the FTC complaint, along with the Burr, Patterson & Auld Company of Detroit, Michigan. Balfour owned nearly all of the stock in the Detroit-based company. The complaint charged that the two companies had negotiated \"sole official jeweler\" contracts with nearly all national Greek-letter organizations, including social organizations, professional organizations, and honor societies. As a result of the exclusive contracts, Balfour controlled 99 percent of jewelry sales to members of those organizations. The complaint also charged Balfour with enticing personnel away from competitors and selling or bidding below cost to drive competitors out of markets.\n\nBalfour ultimately lost its case with the FTC, and its existing insignia contracts were voided in 1968. The FTC required Balfour to issue contracts going forward under new ground rules.\n\nIn the 1970s, Balfour began producing a much wider variety of products for sport champions. When L.G. Balfour died in 1973, the ownership of the company was placed in a trust administered by the Bank of New England. In the late 1970s, Balfour acquired the Norton Facility and Caudle Engraving in Dallas, after which the company's graphics business greatly expanded.\n\nThomas Wyman purchased Balfour in 1983 and opened a new ring plant shortly thereafter. In 1998, Balfour secured a three-year, $20 million corporate recognition program contract with AT&T. Following the awarding of the large AT&T contract, Town & Country Corporation purchased Balfour in November 1988. Chelsea, Massachusetts based Town & Country, a maker of fine jewelry and luxury products, planned to continue the operation of all existing Balfour facilities and leave existing Balfour management in place.\n\nIn 1994, Balfour sold off its fraternal division, ending its work in the area that was responsible for the birth of the company in 1913. The division, responsible for fraternity and sorority jewelry, was sold to Buddy Cote, a longtime Balfour employee. Many existing fraternal division clients and employees followed Cote to his new business, Legacy Fine Jewelry. Legacy focused on manufacturing badges and pins and outsourced ring production to Balfour. Legacy soon ended its contractual relationship with Balfour due to difficulties between the companies, upon which Legacy turned to Masters of Design, a small firm producing rings, to supply its ring manufacturing needs. The two companies agreed to merge resulting in Legacy Fine Jewelry becoming the Legacy Division of Masters of Design.\n\nIn December 1996, Town & Country Corporation announced its plans to sell its L.G. Balfour division to CJC Holdings, Inc. for approximately $52 million. As part of the deal, Balfour would merge operations with ArtCarved, which was an operating unit of CJC Holdings, Inc. Balfour would close all Attleboro, Massachusetts operations and move 430 jobs from Attleboro to Austin, Texas at ArtCarved's headquarters. Attleboro employees that did not move to Austin were laid off. CJC Holdings, Inc. set up a new company known as Scholastic Brands, Inc. to combine the operations of Balfour and ArtCarved, and the acquisition took effect on December 16, 1996. In 1997, the name of the new parent company was changed from Scholastic Brands, Inc. to Commemorative Brands, Inc.\n\nCommemorative Brands changed its name to American Achievement Corporation in June 2000. American Achievement Corporation, is owned by Fenway Partners, a New York based private equity firm. In 2002, American Achievement Corporation announced the acquisition of the Philadelphia-area firm, Milestone Traditions, a company specializing in the development of exclusive official ring programs. With this acquisition, Balfour, ArtCarved, Taylor Publishing, and Milestone Traditions were all combined under the American Achievement Corporation. American Achievement increased its holdings again in 2004 with the purchase of CB Announcements, a Manhattan, Kansas provider of graduation announcements for the college market. The operations of CB announcements were consolidated with the Balfour operating division. While the L.G. Balfour Company held contracts with ninety percent of all national fraternal organizations, the Balfour brand under the American Achievement Corporation is no longer a maker of fraternity and sorority jewelry.\n\nIn 2009, the American Achievement Corporation dropped its Taylor Publishing yearbook brand in order to consolidate its yearbook operations under the stronger Balfour brand.\n\nLloyd Balfour was initiated to the York Rite of Freemasonry, till his elevation to the highest degree of Grand Master.\n\n"}

It was written in French, the original title is \"Le Rire. Essai sur la signification du comique\" (\"Laughter, an essay on the meaning of the comic\").\n\nThe three essays were first published in the French review \"Revue de Paris\". A book was published in 1924 by the Alcan publishing house. It was reprinted in 1959 by the Presses Universitaires de France, on the occasion of the hundredth anniversary of the birth of Bergson.\n\nIn a foreword published in 1900, but suppressed in 1924, Bergson explains that through the three articles, he wanted to study laughter, especially the laughter caused by the comic, and to determine the principal categories of comic situations, to determine the laws of the comic. He also added a list of works and studies about laughter and the comic.\n\nIn the preface written in 1924 to replace the initial foreword, Bergson explains that his method is entirely new because it consists in determining the process of the comic instead of analyzing the effects of the comic. He specifies that his method does not contradict the results of the other one, but he assumes that it is more rigorous from a scientific point of view. He adds a larger bibliography.\n\nThe first essay is made up of three parts:\n\nIn a short introduction, Bergson announces that he will try to define the comic, but he does not want to give a rigid definition of the word; he wants to deal with the comic as part of human life. His ambition is also to have a better knowledge of society, of the functioning of human imagination and of collective imagination, but also of art and life.\n\nGeneral facts on the comic\n\nBergson begins to note three facts on the comic:\n\nThe social role of laughter\n\nBergson now assumes that the comic requires the use of intelligence instead of sensibility, and he tries to determine what is the real role of intelligence in a comic situation. He takes the example of a man falling down in the street in front of passers-by. Laughter is caused by an accidental situation, caused by a movement. The source of the comic is the presence of a rigidity in life. Life is defined by Bergson a perpetual movement, it is characterized by flexibility and agility. Comic situations, such as that of a falling man, are situations where movement is not flexible.\n\nHowever, the comic is not only based upon unusual situations, but also upon characters and individuals. Bergson takes the example of absent-minded people, a common source of comedy. People tend to associate individuals with a comic character, which increases the comic. In addition, when we make fun of somebody for one of his vices, it is because the individual is unaware of his own vice while we are aware of it. Thus laughter forces people to be better and to suppress their vices, because laughter makes them be conscious of them. This is why Bergson asserts that laughter has a moral role, it is a factor of uniformity of behaviours, it eliminates ludicrous and eccentric attitudes : « Beyond actions and attitudes that are automatically punished by their natural consequences, there remains a certain inflexibility of the body, of the mind and of the character that society would like to eliminate to obtain a greater elasticity and a better sociability of its members. This inflexibility is the comic, laughter is the punishment ».\n\nComic and forms of materiality\n\nLaughter can be caused by ugliness, but ugliness is not always comic. To laugh about ugliness, we need to have a naive, immediate, original approach, not to think. We also have to focus on a specific feature of the person and to associate the person with this feature. It is the same with cartoonists, who exaggerate physical and natural features of people. Our imagination sees in everyone the efforts of the soul to dynamise materiality, the soul or the mind give flexibility, agility and animation to the rigid body and to materiality. However the body tends to rigidify itself, and it produces a comic effect: « When materiality succeeds in fixing the movement of the soul, in hindering its grace, it obtains a comic effect. To define comic in comparison to its contrary, we should oppose it to grace instead of beauty. It is stiffness rather than ugliness ».\n\nComic of gesture and movements\n\nBergson concludes as an immediate consequence of the previous chapter that « attitudes, gestures and movements of the human body are subject to laughter precisely in the way that body makes us think to a simple machine ». Humans tend to laugh when they see the effect of a machine within the human body. This is why when we concentrate our attention on a particular gesture made by a speaker to better express his thinking, we automatically find it comic whereas this movement in itself is not comic. We also laugh when someone imitates somebody else, because to imitate somebody, the imitator reproduces the most mechanical, the most unconscious movements and gestures of the person. This is also the case with the parody of an activity. For Bergson, this explains also why, as Pascal had noted, when we see two faces that look like very much, we find it comic, while the faces alone are not comic. And finally: « This is because really lively life is not supposed to repeat itself. Where there is repetition, complete similarity, we suspect that there is mechanism behind life. That diversion of life towards mechanism is the real cause of laughter. »\n\nThe comic and human imagination\n\nAt the beginning of chapter five, Bergson thinks again about his method of analysis. He recalls that to look for a unique method of the comic does not make sense. However, there is a central cause of the comic, and all comic situations are derived from it. This central cause is mechanism applied to life, and all comic effects are articulated around this cause by our imagination. There are three main directions in which our imagination is oriented to produce comic effects, three general laws:\n\n"}

Depending on the scale and type of production, the board op may be responsible for conventional or automated lighting fixtures, as well as practicals and, in some instances, controlling video as well. \n\nSometimes, most commonly in small productions, the Light board Operator will also be the stage manager. Another variation in smaller productions has the responsibilities of Light board Operator and Sound operator combined into one position. In the smallest productions, all three of these functions are done by one person. For productions where lighting and sound are operated by a single person, as well productions where sound needs to be exactly timed with lighting, it is not unusual to use MIDI Show Control (MSC), Open Sound Control (OSC), or Timecode (SMPTE Time Code) to synchronize the lighting, video, and audio consoles.\n\nThe light board operator may, in some cases, also be the lighting designer for a production.\n\nThe light op has many responsibilities in theater, especially in small productions. For small productions, the light op may also be the lighting designer and master electrician, and is therefore required to create a lighting plot, and perform a complete hang and focus in addition to their duties as board operator. In more professional environments, the light board operator is a highly specialized professional who is usually well versed in the intricacies of a wide variety of lighting instruments and control consoles, and able to easily program complex lighting cues involving multiple fixtures and other components. \n\nDuring the technical rehearsals, the light board operator usually programs the lighting console with the assistance of the lighting designer and stage manager. In situations where manual boards are being used, the light board operator will work with the lighting designer and the stage manager to practice the timing of the lighting changes.\n\nDuring the performance, the light board operator is often on headset with the Deputy Stage Manager, and multiple other members of the running crew. Their responsibility lies primarily in advancing the cues under the direction of the deputy stage manager. It is important that light board operators be familiar with the light plot, as they may be called upon to make \"on the fly\" changes to accommodate unexpected circumstances that occur during the production.\n\n\n"}

Today, the Kyiv Opera Company performs at the National Opera House of Ukraine named after Taras Shevchenko in Kyiv.\n\nEstablished in the summer of 1867 by Ferdinand Berger (? - 1875). Berger succeeded in inviting many talented singers, musicians, and conductors, and the city council (duma) had offered the newly created trouppe to use the City Theatre (constructed in 1856, architect I. Shtrom) for their performances. Officially, the theatre was named the City Theatre but was most commonly referred to as the Russian Opera. The day of the first performance, November 8 (October 27 old style), 1867 was made a city holiday. The performance of the opera \"Askold's Tomb\" by Alexey Verstovsky was the troupe's debut. The initial success is attributed to the vocal talents of that time of O. Satagano-Gorchakova, F. L'vov, M. Agramov but also to the captivating plot taken from some principal pages of the ancient history of the city.\n\nEarly performances were mostly Russian operas, including \"Ruslan and Ludmila\" by Mikhail Glinka, \"Rusalka\" by Alexander Dargomyzhsky, \"Maccabees\" by Anton Rubinstein and \"The Power of the Fiend\" by A. Serov, as well as translated European operas including \"The Barber of Seville\" by Rossini, \"The Marriage of Figaro\" by Mozart, \"Der Freischütz\" by Weber, \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" by Donizetti, and operas by Giuseppe Verdi, which became the favorite of the Kievites.\n\nOn February 4, 1896, after a morning performance of \"Eugene Onegin\" by Tchaikovsky, a fire erupted from an unextinguished candle in the theatre. The fire consumed the whole building within several hours. One of the largest musical libraries in Europe along with numerous costumes and stage props of many performances were lost during the fire. After the fire of the City Theatre, the troupe performed on other stages for several years, including Bergonie's Theatre (now the National Theatre of Russian Drama named after Lesya Ukrainka), Solovtsov's Theatre (now the National Theatre named after Ivan Franko) and even on the arena of the famous Krutikov's Circus.\n\nAfter the fire, the City Council had announced the international competition to design a new building for the Opera Theatre in Kyiv. The winning proposal was by Victor Schröter. The exterior was designed in Neo-Renaissance style and had accounted for the needs of the actors and the spectators. The interior was redesigned in a classical style and called \"Viennese Modern\". However, his greatest achievement is considered to be the stage - one of the largest in Europe designed to the latest engineering standards.\n\nOn , the solemn opening of the new premise of the theatre took place with a performance of cantata Kyiv by composer Wilhelm Hartweld (1859 - 1927) and a presentation of the opera \"Life for the Tsar\" by M. Glinka.\n\nOn , there was a performance of Rimsky-Korsakov's \"The Tale of Tsar Saltan\" at the Kiev Opera House in the presence of the Tsar and his two oldest daughters, the Grand Duchesses Olga and Tatiana. The theater was occupied by 90 men posted as interior guards. During the intermission of a performance Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin was killed.\nAccording to Alexander Spiridovich, after the second act \"Stolypin was standing in front of the ramp separating the parterre from the orchestra, his back to the stage. On his right were Baron Freedericks and Gen. Suhkomlinov.\" His personal body guard had gone to smoke. Stolypin was shot twice, once in the arm and once in the chest by Dmitry Bogrov, a leftist revolutionary, trying to rehabilitate himself. Bogrov ran to one of the entries and was subsequently caught. \"He [Stolypin] turned toward the Imperial Box, then seeing the Tsar who had entered the box, he made a gesture with both hands to tell the Tsar to go back.\" The orchestra began to play \"God Save the Tsar.\" The doctors hoped Stolypin would recover, but, despite never losing consciousness, his condition deteriorated. The next day, the distressed Tsar knelt at Stolypin's hospital bedside and kept repeating the words \"Forgive me\". Stolypin died three days later.\n\nIn the first decade of the 20th century, the Kyiv Opera Theatre attracted the most outstanding Ukrainian and Russian singers, including O. Petlyash, P. Tsecevich, K. Voronets, M. Medvedev, K. Brun, O. Mosin and O. Kamionsky and famous opera stars from the West often came on tours. Several unusual for the time performances took place on the stage: \"Die Walkure\" by Wagner, \"Sadko\" by Rimsky-Korsakov and \"Mefistofele\" by Arrigo Boito.\n\nAs Kyiv began to grow and with the conclusion of World War I, the Kyiv Opera occupied a special place in the USSR and the world. The Kyiv Opera Theatre was considered to be one of the most prestigious in Ukraine and Russia. Kurt Adler was First Conductor from 1933-1935.\n\nNotes\n"}

Such myths often serve as an important national symbol and affirm a set of national values. A national myth may sometimes take the form of a national epic or be incorporated into a civil religion. A group of related myths about a nation may be referred to as the national mythos from μῦθος the original Greek word for \"myth\".\n\nA national myth is a legend or fictionalized narrative which has been elevated to a serious mythological, symbolic, and esteemed level so as to be true to the nation. It might simply over-dramatize true incidents, omit important historical details, or add details for which there is no evidence; or it might simply be a fictional story that no one takes to be true literally, but contains a symbolic meaning for the nation. The national folklore of many nations includes a founding myth, which may involve a struggle against colonialism or a war of independence. In many cases, the meaning of the national myth is disputed among different parts of the population.\n\nIn some places, the national myth may be spiritual in tone and refer to stories of the nation's founding at the hands of a God, several gods, leaders favored by gods, and other supernatural beings.\n\nNational myths serve many social and political purposes. National myths often exist only for the purpose of state-sponsored propaganda. In totalitarian dictatorships, the leader might be given, for example, a mythical supernatural life history in order to make him or her seem god-like and supra-powerful (see also cult of personality). However, national myths exist in every society. In liberal regimes they can serve the purpose of inspiring civic virtue and self-sacrifice (Miller 1995), or of consolidating the power of dominant groups and legitimizing their rule.\n\nNational myths have been created and propagated by national intellectuals, who have used them as instruments of political mobilization on demographic bases such as ethnicity.\n\nThe concept of national identity is inescapably connected with myths. A complex of myths is at the core of every ethnic identity. Some scholars believe that national identities, supported by invented histories, were constructed only after national movements and national ideologies emerged.\n\nAll modern national identities were preceded by nationalist movements. Although the term \"nation\" was used in the Middle Ages, it had totally different meaning than in the age of nationalism, where it was linked to the efforts aimed to creation of the nation-states.\n\nBesides their social background, nationalist myths have also a psychological explanation which is connected with nationalist myth of stable homeland community. The complexity of relations with the modern external world and incoherence of the inner psychological world can result with anxiety which is reduced by static self-labelling and self-construction and gaining an imaginary emotion of stability.\n\nTwo of nationalism's primary myths are connected with beliefs in:\n\nThe nationalist myths portray the nation as sleeping and waiting to be awakened, but scholarly discourse avoids such images because national identity either exists or not and can not be asleep and awakened.\n\nNationalist myths sometimes have a tendency to stimulate conflicts between nations, to magnify distinctive characteristics of the national group and to overstate the threat to the nation posed by other groups propagating militant fulfilment of their goals.\n\n\n"}

The first, \"Octopussy\", starring Roger Moore as James Bond, was released in 1983 as the thirteenth film in the series and provided the back story for the film Octopussy's family, while \"The Property of a Lady\" was more closely adapted for an auction sequence in the film. \"The Living Daylights\", released in 1987, was the fifteenth Bond film produced by Eon and starred Timothy Dalton in his first appearance as Bond. \"007 in New York\", meanwhile, provided character and plot elements for the first two films starring Daniel Craig as Bond, \"Casino Royale\" and \"Quantum of Solace\".\n\nSecret Service operative James Bond, code name 007, is assigned to apprehend a hero of the Second World War implicated in a murder involving a cache of Nazi gold. Bond appears only briefly in this story, which is told mostly in flashback from the perspective of Major Dexter Smythe, the man Bond has been sent to bring in. Smythe remained in Kitzbühel, Austria, after the war, found the gold with the help of a mountain guide, and killed him in order to keep it for himself. Bond was put on the case after the guide's body fell out of a glacier and he recognized the man as a ski instructor and father figure from his youth. Smythe is now a melancholy alcoholic living alone on the beach, interacting mainly with the residents of its coral reef – including the titular Octopussy, a beloved 'pet' octopus that Smythe feeds and talks to.\n\nBond chooses not to take Smythe into custody immediately, but leaves him to contemplate his options – suicide or a court martial. As Smythe hunts for scorpion fish to feed Octopussy, he suffers a sting which triggers a fatal heart attack, during which Octopussy pulls him under. Deciding to spare Smythe's reputation, Bond classifies the death as an accidental drowning.\n\nAn unusually morose James Bond is assigned sniper duty to help British agent 272 escape from East Berlin. Bond's duty is to safeguard his crossing into West Berlin by eliminating a top KGB assassin codenamed \"Trigger\" who has been dispatched to kill him. Bond takes up a position on the western edge of the border, in a hotel overlooking the no man's land of broken, brightly lit ground that 272 will have to cross. On each of three nights, he sees a female orchestra arrive for rehearsal and leave, taking particular notice of a beautiful blonde cellist. Once 272 starts to cross the border, Bond sees Trigger get in position to kill him and realizes that it is the cellist. He adjusts his aim at the last moment and shoots her rifle instead of killing her, allowing 272 to reach safety.\n\nAfterward, Bond admits to his spotter that he did not try for a kill shot only because Trigger had been a woman. He muses that even though 272 is safe, the mission will be considered a failure because he did not kill Trigger, and he hopes that M will fire him for it.\n\nThe Secret Service learns that Maria Freudenstein, an employee known to be a double agent working for the Soviet Union, has just received a valuable item of jewelry crafted by Peter Carl Fabergé and is planning to auction it at Sotheby's. Bond suspects that the Resident Director of the KGB in London will attend the auction and underbid for the item, in order to drive the price up to the value needed to pay Maria for her services. Bond attends the auction, spots the man, and leaves to make arrangements for his expulsion from London as \"persona non grata\".\n\nA brief tale in which Bond muses about New York City and his favourite recipe for scrambled eggs, during a quick mission to the titular city to warn a female MI6 employee that her new boyfriend is a KGB agent. It is notable for including a rare humorous conclusion and for its mention of Solange, a young lady of Bond's intimate acquaintance who works in a shop, Abercrombie's, \"appropriately employed in their Indoor Games Department\".\n\nThe author of the \"continuation\" Bond stories, Raymond Benson, noted that in \"The Living Daylights\" Bond's thoughts on killing are examined once again, showing that although 007 did not like doing it, he considered that he must as part of his duty to complete an assignment. Once the mission is completed, with Bond deliberately not killing the assassin, there is an attitude of complacency with Bond shrugging off his colleague's complaints about the incident. Academic Jeremy Black sees the colleague, the officious Captain Spender, as the antithesis of Bond and an echo of Colonel Schreiber, the head of security at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), who appeared in \"From a View to a Kill\".\n\nIn the act of not killing the assassin, the theme of disobedience is raised in \"The Living Daylights\", with Bond calling what he has to do \"murder\" and subsequently dismissing his actions by saying \"with any luck it will cost me my Double-0 number\". Raymond Benson considered \"Octopussy\" to be a morality tale, with greed bringing repercussions years later to the main protagonist, Dexter Smythe.\n\nOn the morning of 12 August 1964, Fleming died of a heart attack; eight months later, \"The Man with the Golden Gun\" was published. The rights to Fleming's works were held by Glidrose Productions (now Ian Fleming Publications) and it was decided by the company that two short stories, \"Octopussy\" and \"The Living Daylights\", would be published in 1966.\n\nThe story \"Octopussy\" was written in early 1962 at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica. The story is told in the manner of \"Quantum of Solace\", with Bond as catalyst for story told in flashback, rather than as a main character for action. The topics chosen for Fleming were familiar ground for him to cover, with hidden gold, tropical fish and the wartime exploits of commandos all coming from elements of his past. Also from the past, or from his acquaintance, were other references used in the story and Miscellaneous Objectives Bureau was a fictional version of Fleming's 30 AU unit. One of Fleming's neighbours in Jamaica, and later his lover, was Blanche Blackwell, mother of Chris Blackwell of Island Records. Fleming had previously used Blackwell's name as the guano-collecting ship in \"Dr. No\", calling it \"Blanche\". Blackwell had given Fleming a coracle called \"Octopussy\", the name of which Fleming used for the story. \"Octopussy\" was posthumously serialised in the \"Daily Express\" newspaper, 4–8 October 1965.\n\nFleming originally titled \"The Living Daylights\" as \"Trigger Finger\", although when it first appeared, in \"The Sunday Times\" colour supplement of 4 February 1962, it was under the title of \"Berlin Escape\". It was also published in the June 1962 issue of the American magazine \"Argosy\" under the same name. For \"The Sunday Times\", Fleming had commissioned Graham Sutherland to undertake the artwork to accompany the piece, at a cost of 100 guineas, although the artwork wasn't used in the published edition.\n\nAs background research to the story, Fleming corresponded with Captain E.K. Le Mesurier, secretary of the National Rifle Association at Bisley for information and to correct some of the more specialist areas of knowledge required for sniper shooting. Part of the background to the plot, of using the noise of the orchestra to cover the crossing over no man's land, was inspired by Pat Reid's escape from Colditz prisoner of war camp, with two escapers having to run across a courtyard under the cover of the noise from an orchestra. The conductor of the Colditz orchestra was Douglas Bader, who played golf with Fleming on a number of occasions. The assassin, Trigger, was partly based on Amaryllis Fleming, Ian's half-sister, a concert cellist with blonde hair, and Fleming managed to get a passing reference to her in the story, saying: \"Of course Suggia had managed to look elegant, as did that girl Amaryllis somebody.\"\n\n\"Property of a Lady\", which was written in early 1963, was commissioned by Sotheby's for use in their annual journal, \"The Ivory Hammer\", and was published in November 1963 and later in \"Playboy\"; Sotheby's chairman Peter Wilson is mentioned by name in the story. Fleming was so unhappy with the final piece he wrote to Wilson and refused payment for something he considered so lacklustre. Nonetheless, it was adapted as the auction sequence in the film \"Octopussy\".\n\nIn 1959 Fleming was commissioned by \"The Sunday Times\" to write a series of articles based on world cities, material for which later was collected into a book entitled \"Thrilling Cities\"; whilst travelling through New York for material, Fleming wrote \"007 in New York\" from Bond's point of view. \"007 in New York\" was originally titled \"Reflections in a Carey Cadillac\" and it contains a recipe for scrambled eggs which came from May Maxwell, the housekeeper to friend Ivar Bryce who gave her name to Bond's own housekeeper, May. The story was first published in the \"New York Herald Tribune\" in October 1963 as \"Agent 007 in New York\", but was subsequently renamed as \"007 in New York\" for the 1964 US editions of \"Thrilling Cities\".\n\n\"Octopussy and The Living Daylights\" was published in Britain on 23 June 1966 by Jonathan Cape and cost 10s.6d. The hardback edition of the book contained only the two stories mentioned in the title, although when the paperbacks editions were published, \"The Property of a Lady\" was also included. Once again artist Richard Chopping provided the cover art, although his fee rose, to 350 guineas. The book was published in US by New American Library with illustrations from Paul Bacon. By 2002, \"007 in New York\" had been added to the book by Penguin Books.\n\nPhilip Larkin wrote in \"The Spectator\" that \"I am not surprised that Fleming preferred to write novels. James Bond, unlike Sherlock Holmes, does not fit snugly into the short story length: there is something grandiose and intercontinental about his adventures that require elbow room and such examples of the form as we have tend to be eccentric or muted. These are no exception.\" The critic for \"The Times Literary Supplement\" wrote that the book was \"slight and predictable, and usual sex and violence yield to a plausible use of ballistics and marine biology\". Writing in \"The Listener\", Anthony Burgess thought that \"in their fascinated poring on \"things\"...remind us that the stuff of the anti-novel needn't necessarily spring from a thought-out aesthetic\", going on to note that \"it is the mastery of the world that gives Fleming his peculiar literary niche\". On a personal note, Burgess added \"I admired all the Bond books and I'm sorry there'll be no more. A sad farewell to Fleming\".\n\nTwo of the short stories were adapted for publication in comic strip format, which were published daily in the \"Daily Express\" newspaper and syndicated worldwide. \"The Living Daylights\" ran from 12 September to 12 November 1966, adapted by Jim Lawrence and illustrated by Yaroslav Horak; the same pair also worked on \"Octopussy\", which ran from 14 November 1966 to 27 May 1967. The story lines for the strips were altered from the original Fleming version to ensure that they contained a glamorous reason for being Bond involved and to include Bond in action. The strips were reprinted by Titan Books in 1988 and then again in \"The James Bond Omnibus Vol. 2\", published in 2011.\n\nIn 1983 Eon Productions loosely adapted elements of two of the stories, \"Octopussy\" and \"The Property of a Lady\" for the thirteenth film in their Bond series, starring Roger Moore as Bond. \"Octopussy\" provided the title of the film and the background for the character Octopussy, the daughter of a character Bond had allowed to commit suicide, rather than face the shame of arrest and imprisonment. The film also used the plot device of auctioning of a Fabergé egg at Sotheby's from \"The Property of a Lady\" and, as with the story, the auction item was described as being the same \"property of a lady\".\n\nIn 1987 Eon used the plot of \"The Living Daylights\", almost unchanged, for a section of their 1987 film of the same name. The film starred Timothy Dalton in his first role as Bond, whilst the character of Trigger became that of cello player Kara Milovy.\n\nIn 2006 Eon used the plot of Fleming's first novel, \"Casino Royale\", for its 21st film of the same name. However, a main character was named Solange, after the woman featured in \"007 in New York.\"\n\nIn 2008 Eon used the basic premise from the short story \"007 in New York\" as part of the film \"Quantum of Solace\", in which Bond warns a female intelligence employee that her boyfriend is an enemy agent.\n\nIn \"Spectre\", Hans Oberhauser, a background character in \"Octopussy\" is revealed to be the father of Ernst Stavro Blofeld and a former caretaker of Bond in his youth. In the film it is strongly hinted that Blofeld killed Oberhauser because he felt that Oberhauser loved Bond more than him, his own son.\n\n\n\n"}

Cardinal, who had been placed in 28 different homes during his 14 years in Alberta's child welfare system, hanged himself from a cross bar he had nailed between two trees near his last foster home, northwest of Edmonton.\n\nThe film makes use of Cardinal's remembrances from his diary, and helped to change public perceptions in Canada around the treatment of children in the foster care system.\n\nCardinal was born in Fort Chipewyan. Because of alcoholism in his family, the children were separated from their parents. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police moved the children to Fort McMurray where they were given different foster parents, with Richard and his older brother Charlie housed together for the first while—where a litany of physical and mental abuse began.\n\nObomsawin offers Cardinal's life story as an expression of the plight of \"15,000 native children [who] are wards of the provinces.\" Cardinal recollections of abuse at his first foster home placement at age six, when he and his older brother were whipped with their pants down in front of the three daughters of his foster family. It quotes Cardinal's brother as stating, \"What Richard needed most was to go home. His funeral was the best social service that was provided for Richard, because it finally brought his family together.\"\n\nShe also made the film for other children: \"I want people who look at the film to have a different attitude next time they meet what is called a 'problem child', and develop some love and some relationship to the child -- instead of alienating him.\"\n\nHis death sparked a provincial government inquiry, which offered 22 recommendations for improving how courts, the provincial government, schools, hospitals, aboriginal organizations and media deal with foster children—including recommendations that have been repeated at subsequent inquiries following Aboriginal youth deaths. However, a January 2014 article in the \"Calgary Herald\" reported that such recommendations, which are neither binding on the government nor tracked for implementation, have largely been ignored.\n\nIn recent years, \"Richard Cardinal: Cry from a Diary of a Métis Child\" has been featured in retrospectives at the Museum of Modern Art (2008), Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival (2009), and the Berlin International Film Festival (2013).\n\n\n"}

They indicate the nature of early readership of Caxton’s work, and they also allow historians to infer something about Caxton’s own sense of his projects.\n\nPerhaps most famous and extensive of his sammelbände work was the collection made out of Caxton's 1476-8 productions, known since the time of Caxton scholar William Blades as “the volume purchased by King George I from the estate of Bishop John Moore in 1714.” This volume is a compendium of Caxton’s first run of vernacular poetry, and the texts within appear as follows:\n\nModern students of early Tudor literature only rarely encounter extant \"Sammelbände\", most of which were disbound in the nineteenth century. \n\nYet printed editions of works by (or ascribed to) Geoffrey Chaucer, John Lydgate, Richard Rolle, Margery Kempe, Stephen Hawes, John Skelton, and writers involved in Tudor religious controversy from John Wycliffe to William Tyndale may all be traced to such composite volumes.\n\nIn Caxton’s case specifically, he presents a Lydgatenized Chaucer, even to the point of giving the \"Parliament of Fowls\" a unique new title, \"The Temple of Brass\", to follow Lydgate’s \"Temple of Glas\". It is a testimony both to Caxton’s understanding of vernacular poetry and to the tastes of his clientele. It is a volume centered on a particular publishing event, a volume that contains not only the key texts by canonical authors, but the critical instruction for their understanding: \"The Book of Curtesye\". \n\nGenerally, the creation of sammelbände can have various effects on the readership of texts. It offers people a larger framework for the understanding of texts within the volumes; these volumes also used prologues and epilogues in order to provide a further framework for readership. These explanatory additions and the use of advertisements, such as Caxton’s “new and improved edition” of \"The Canterbury Tales\" shows the movement away from privileged, aristocratic readership towards the readership of the middle class, solidifying printing as a business and a social progression.\n"}

Some of her storylines have included trying and failing to rebuild relationships with her children Carly (Kellie Shirley) and Deano (Matt Di Angelo), a friendship with Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), a volatile relationship with Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), the introduction of her son Mick (Danny Dyer), who at first was believed to be her brother, and his family, an affair with Phil, despite his being in a relationship with Sharon Rickman (Letitia Dean) and accidentally shooting Phil. Former \"EastEnders\" executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins has described her as a \"new icon\" of the show.\n\nShirley first appears, when, against her former husband Kevin Wicks's (Phil Daniels) wishes, she introduces herself to her adult children, Carly (Kellie Shirley) and Dean (Matt Di Angelo). Carly is hostile but Dean is amenable, so Shirley moves to Walford to be near them. Kevin and Shirley maintain an antagonistic relationship. Shirley attempts to sabotage his relationship with Denise Fox (Diane Parish) and threatens to tell her children about their true paternity, which she eventually does: she tells Carly her father is a man named Daniel and Dean that she does not know who his father is. Kevin had brought up Carly and Dean as his own, as well as his natural child with Shirley, Jimbo (Lloyd Richards), who had cystic fibrosis, which Shirley struggled with and ended up walking out on the family, not attending Jimbo's funeral when he died aged 21. The revelation only drives Carly and Dean further away. When she learns that Kevin has been selling cut-and-shut cars, she confronts him. They try to dispose of a stolen car together but are involved in a crash, which kills Kevin. In the aftermath, Carly rejects her mother and leaves Walford. Dean, who gets in trouble with the police, is imprisoned and when released he blames Shirley for all his problems and also moves away.\n\nShirley begins a relationship with Vinnie Monks (Bobby Davro), at the urging of her best friend Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), but the romance eventually ends when Vinnie learns Shirley is harbouring feelings for Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Phil, an alcoholic, gets drunk with Shirley, uses her for sex and as a surrogate mother for his son, Ben (Joshua Pascoe). Shirley falls in love with Phil. She gives him an alibi when he is suspected of murder and helps him get custody of his daughter, Louise (Brittany Papple), leading to them beginning a legitimate relationship. Shirley is so in love with Phil that she is willing to overlook his misdemeanours. She stands by him when Louise returns to her mother and Phil develops an addiction to crack cocaine. She even forgives him for several affairs, firstly with fellow addict, Rainie Cross (Tanya Franks) and secondly with Glenda Mitchell (Glynis Barber). In remorse for his wrongdoings, Phil tries to convince Shirley to marry him and she almost does but decides that marriage is unnecessary. She remains with Phil under the proviso that he never cheats on her again.\n\nShirley's life is thrown into turmoil when her best friend, Heather, is found dead. Unknown to Shirley, the murderer is Phil's son Ben. Phil tries to cover up Ben's involvement but Shirley grows obsessed with tracing the killer. She finds the murder weapon, a metal photo frame, in a neighbour's house and traces it to a charity shop where it was donated by Phil. She realises that Phil was involved in Heather's death and discusses her suspicions with Ben, who buckles under pressure and reveals information about Heather's death that only the murderer could know. Shirley realises that Ben killed Heather and tries to drown him in the bath, but Phil stops her. Phil convinces her not to call the police but Ben goes to the police and confesses. Unable to cope with Phil's betrayal, Shirley ends the relationship and starts drinking heavily. Phil sees that she needs help and calls Carly, who takes Shirley to stay with her and her son Jimmy. When Shirley returns, she remains hostile to Phil and takes his hush money, despite still having feelings for him.\n\nShirley moves into The Queen Victoria public house, when her supposed brother, Mick Carter (Danny Dyer), buys it and moves his family to Walford. After 25 years apart, she is reunited with her father, Stan Carter (Timothy West). Despite their mutual hostility, Stan gives Shirley £10,000 which she invests in the pub for a 20% share. It transpires that Stan is in contact with Dean. Stan encourages a reunion with mother and son, but Dean remains hostile to Shirley. Eventually, Shirley manages to build bridges with her father and Dean. Shirley grows jealous of Phil's relationship with Sharon Rickman (Letitia Dean). Sharon agrees to marry Phil but discovers that Phil was responsible for a break-in at her bar. Furious, Sharon decides to fleece Phil for his money in revenge. Phil discovers this, confides in Shirley and starts an affair with her, planning to jilt Sharon at the altar and resume a relationship with Shirley. However, Sharon and Phil discover their respective deceptions and ultimately decide to marry. Dejected, Shirley admits her affair with Phil after the wedding and when Phil rejects her, she shoots him. Fearing Shirley's incarceration, Shirley's aunt Babe Smith (Annette Badland) organises her escape. Dean is distraught and when Mick's partner, Linda Carter (Kellie Bright), comforts him, and he rapes her. Mick and Dean eventually bring Shirley back to Walford when Stan admits he has terminal prostate cancer.\n\nThey meet Shirley's old boyfriend, Buster Briggs (Karl Howman), and Dean realises that he is Buster's son. They plan to run away together but Mick has Buster arrested for breaking his bail conditions as he is on day release. It is later revealed to viewers that Buster is also Mick's father and Shirley is actually Mick's mother, not his sister. Shirley and Mick find Shirley's mother, Sylvie Carter (Linda Marlowe), hiding at Babe's house. Sylvie has Alzheimer's disease and tells Mick she is not his mother but he dismisses this as her being confused. Shirley tries to stop Mick interacting with Sylvie, fearing her secret will be revealed. However, Sylvie is invited to Christmas dinner. Secrets are divulged at the dinner: Linda reveals Dean raped her so Mick tells Shirley before attacking Dean and is only stopped by Shirley confessing that she is his mother, not sister, and that Dean is his brother. The family is split following this revelation as Shirley sides with Dean, believing his version of events. Shirley reveals the reason why she kept her identity as Mick's mother a secret: her pregnancy with Mick was scorned by Sylvie, who attempted to force a miscarriage by pushing her down the stairs. Shirley was forced to raise Mick as her brother and Stan's son, out of fear she would never see him again. Hostilities continue and Shirley struggles to bond with Mick, due to her and Buster's continued alliance to Dean. This results in Shirley being banished from Stan's funeral, despite Shirley having nursed her father through his dying moments.\n\nShirley learns from Dean he has a seven-year-old daughter and confronts the child's mother, Shabnam Masood (Rakhee Thakrar), who continues to lie.

Shirley nearly throws Buster out and starts considering adopting Jade alone but Carol admits that nothing happened and Shirley helps her come to terms with her mastectomy. Shirley and Buster are awarded custody of Jade after a grieving Shabnam does not contest it. Shirley prevents Dean from raping Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) and, finally believing that he is a rapist, tries to drown him in the bath but he recovers and strikes her as Linda enters. Dean then admits that he raped Linda and goes into hiding. Dean confronts Shirley at Mick and Linda's wedding and attempts to drown her. Mick saves her and Dean, who is then arrested over Roxy. Shirley then encourages Mick and Linda to get married and helps Nancy and Lee run the pub while Mick and Linda are on their honeymoon and has Jade help out to give her some work experience. She is furious when Shabnam turns up overprotective of Jade outside of her visiting hours, but after Masood tells her that Shabnam is unlikely to have any more children, she grows sympathetic and allows Jade to spend more time with Shabnam.\n\nShe finds Phil binge drinking, where he admits that he drunk-drove and crashed a car with him, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and Sharon's son Dennis Rickman Jnr (Bleu Landau), and Ian took the blame for driving. Shirley encourages Phil to tell Sharon what really happened, and when he eventually does later that night, Sharon ends their marriage. The following day, Shirley learns from Louise (Tilly Keeper) that Phil has been rushed to hospital and his liver is damaged. Sharon, Kathy Sullivan (Gillian Taylforth) and Shirley go to the hospital only to find that Phil has discharged himself. They find Phil drunk at the pub, where he insults his family and hits Kathy. Shirley throws Phil out and admits to Buster that she still has feelings for Phil and is upset as he is risking his health. Buster comforts her and tells her she should move on from Phil because he only cares about himself. A month later, Shirley receives another visiting order from Dean, and eventually decides to visit Dean in prison, to encourage him to plead guilty for trying to rape Roxy. Dean, however, is in denial so Shirley threatens to disown him permanently if he pleads not guilty. The next day, Shabnam tells Shirley, Buster and Jade that she is moving to Ealing so Jade can visit her anytime. In court, Shirley watches as Dean pleads not guilty, much to her disgust. However, due to his failure to surrender to custody on numerous previous occasions, Dean is remanded in custody and a trial in June. Realising that Jade needs protecting from Dean and should be with her mother, Shirley and Buster tell Shabnam that they would like Jade to live with her full-time, giving her full custody, which she accepts. Shirley, unaware that Buster is having an affair with Kathy, is furious when he pays off their acquitted son, Dean, with all their savings, but is later devastated when Buster leaves Walford without saying goodbye to her, whilst she is in the midst of helping Phil end his alcoholism. Mick suggests to Shirley that Buster had an affair with Denise, who is now heavily pregnant. However, when Shirley confronts Denise, Denise confesses she is expecting Phil's son, which is overheard by Sharon.\n\nBabe breaches the pub licence when she inadvertently sells alcohol to an undercover police officer, and the police arrive and arrest Mick, Babe and Shirley. They are formally charged with breaching their pub licence, remaining in custody until their appearance in court the following morning. Shirley later catches Babe stealing money from the safe, and discover that she stolen the entire money that her father left her, Mick and Tina in his will causing Mick to evict her.\nShirley and Mick then disgusted to learn that Lee has assaulted his wife Whitney Carter (Shona McGarty) during a heated argument. Mick confides in Shirley; she strongly advises Mick to tell Lee that he must leave Whitney, which he does so. Shirley and Tina later have arguments as to whether they should put Sylvie in a home as Shirley does not want to look after her as she can see the trouble Mick is in. Realising Mick will never be able to pay the £20,000 fine ordered by the court, Shirley decides to put the blame on herself and she tells the police she knew Babe was breaching their licence but did nothing about it. She is subsequently charged with perverting the cause of justice. Although the Carters initially think that Shirley will only be in prison for six weeks, they are heartbroken to learn that her sentence has been doubled, meaning that she will stay in prison for three months. Tina visits Shirley in prison to inform her of Sylvie's death which doesn't seem to upset Shirley but later when her cellmate Debbie Morton (Beth Cordingly) teases Shirley about her feelings, Shirley beats her up in their cell.\n\nShirley's creation was announced in September 2006, at which time she was described as being \"brassy, rough, tarty and tough-as-old-boots\" by media entertainment website \"Digital Spy\". Henry, who had appeared in the serial during the early 1990s as prostitute Lorraine Salter, said: \"I'm thrilled to be joining \"EastEnders\". I'm both nervous and excited as I've watched it for many years\". Created as an extension of the established Wicks family, Shirley's arrival was welcomed by her son, Deano. Di Angelo deemed his character \"very fond\" of his mother, keen to forge a relationship with her, and attributed Deano's childish characterisation to her absence during his formative years. Other relatives were less enthused by her arrival: Shirley developed a rivalry with Wicks matriarch Pat (Pam St. Clement), which culminated in a physical fight and their arrest in April 2007. \"Digital Spy\" Dek Hogan highlighted a similarity between the two, and commented prior to their fight that Shirley was \"\"so\" like Pat was when she first arrived it's frightening.\"\n\nA friendship developed between Shirley and local businessman Phil Mitchell in 2008, as she underwent a breast-cancer scare. Reluctant to seek medical help, Shirley admitted to Phil that she was afraid, and he responded with \"genuine kindness\". Their friendship developed into romance, and Shirley was later able to save him from an addiction to crack cocaine, which Henry felt reflected the strength of their relationship. Although Shirley was wounded to discover he had been unfaithful to her, Henry explained that, regardless of the tough façade her character projected, she still loved him. She characterised Shirley as \"a strong, proud woman [who] wouldn't stay with someone for [the wrong] reasons\", and suggested they could survive the affair: \"It will need effort to make it work and they'll never have the perfect relationship, but neither Phil nor Shirley would want a completely quiet life.\"\n\nHenry has been nominated for several television awards for her portrayal of Shirley. She and Fergison were nominated in the Best On-Screen Partnership category at the 2008 British Soap Awards, and \"Digital Spy\" Soap Awards, and for Best Double Act at the 2009 \"TV Times\" Awards. Henry was shortlisted in the Best Soap Actress category at the 2009 \"TV Quick\" and \"TV Choice\" awards. At the 2009 \"Inside Soap\" Awards, Shirley was nominated in the Best Bitch category. Henry was also shortlisted in the 'Best Actress' category at the 2012 Inside Soap Awards.\n\nEarly in Shirley's tenure, Hogan advised viewers to \"rejoice in [her] wonderful nastiness\". He found her an \"unpleasant\" addition to the series, and though he commended Henry's portrayal, he hoped to see more possibility of redemption for Shirley, as \"It's difficult to buy into a character that comes across as unremittingly unpleasant.\" Hogan called her \"the most convincing drunk\" in the programme for twenty years, but noted, \"that really doesn't make her any less annoying and her scenes are a pain in the neck to sit through.\" Tess Lamacraft from \"The Sun\" \"Buzz\" magazine questioned Shirley's motivations in accepting Phil's infidelities. She could not decide whether Shirley was \"stupid, desperate or just madly in love\" with him. Kate White of \"Inside Soap\" praised the friendship between Shirley and Jean Slater (Gillian Wright), \"We love, love, love the genius pairing of Jean and Shirley. With Heather [Trott, played by Cheryl Fergison] having been brown bread [dead] for over a year, it's time Shirley got a new BFF – and we reckon zany Jean is perfect.\"\n\nIn the British media she has been referred to as \"Shirley Terrahawk\" due to her resemblance to a character from the \"Terrahawks\". Jim Shelly once branded her the \"human Terrahawk\" in the \"Daily Mirror\" and \"an alcoholic Terrahawk\" in \"The Guardian\". John McKie from the \"Daily Record\" said that Phil getting together with \"Shirley the Terrahawk\" was grotesque. Kevin O'Sullivan from the \"Sunday Mirror\" said that \"Shirley Terrahawk went into theatrical meltdown\" after Heather died; adding that it was \"hilarious overacting\" on Henry's part.\n\n"}

She studied computer generated music with John Chowning and Max Mathews at Stanford University's Artificial Intelligence Labs in the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1974 she formed her own company, Ciani/Musica, and, using a Buchla Analog Modular Synthesizer, composed scores for television commercials for corporations such as Coca-Cola, Merrill Lynch, AT&T and General Electric. Besides music, her specialty was reproducing sound effects on the synthesizer, that recording engineers had found difficult to record properly; the sound of a bottle of Coca-Cola being opened and poured was one of Ciani's most widely recognized works, and was used in a series of radio and television commercials in the late 1970s. She is also responsible for \"logo\" sounds pertaining to Energizer and ABC. Such was the demand for her services, that at one point she was doing up to 50 sessions a week. Her sound effects also appeared in video games (the pinball game \"Xenon\" featured her voice). Such audio logos as the Coca-Cola pop and pour along with video game sound effects and more appear on the 2012 album \"Lixiviation\" (Finders Keepers) along with the only currently available excerpts from her 1975 Buchla Concert.\n\nIn 1977, Ciani provided the sound effects for Meco's disco version of the , which was certified platinum. She added the signature electronic \"swoosh\" to \"Afternoon Delight\" by the Starland Vocal Band. At the time, Ciani thought the work was just a \"song about spaceships\". Ciani scored the Lily Tomlin movie \"The Incredible Shrinking Woman\", distinguishing her as the first solo female composer of a major Hollywood film; Lloyd Williams's 1975 experimental film \"Rainbow's Children\"; and a 1986 documentary about Mother Teresa, as well the TV daytime serial (\"soap opera\") \"One Life to Live\". She also composed the 1976 Columbia Pictures and Columbia Pictures Television theme jingles. She has toured throughout the United States, Italy, Spain, and Asia. In 1980, Ciani demonstrated several of her sound effects on The David Letterman Show. However, while she started performing her own music, Letterman cut her to a commercial break.\n\nIn 1982 Ciani began to record albums in the new-age genre, characterized by a mix of electronic and traditional instruments. Her first album, \"Seven Waves\", was initially released in Japan in 1982, and later released in her native US in 1984 through Atlantic Records. Most of the album was produced using Roland MC-8 and MC-4 music sequencers, combined with a Prophet 5 synthesizer and Roland TR-808 drum machine.\n\nHer 1986 album \"The Velocity of Love\", released by RCA Records, featured Ciani's best known song, the title track. In 1987 she signed to the Private Music label, which released a number of albums from 1988 to 1992, including re-issues of her first two albums. Although emphasizing electronic music in her recordings, her solo piano album \"Pianissimo\", from 1990, became her best-selling album. Ciani ended her contract with Private Music with the compilation \"The Private Music of Suzanne Ciani\", in 1992.\n\nIn the 1990s Ciani founded her own music label, Seventh Wave, on which she has released all her subsequent albums, which have been more classically oriented than her previous recordings. 1994's \"Dream Suite\" was recorded in Moscow with the Young Russia Orchestra, and was Grammy-nominated. 1999's \"Turning\" featured her first composition with lyrics, in the title track, sung by Taiwanese artist Chyi Yu.\n\nIn early 2006, Ciani's \"Silver Ship\" won in The 5th Annual Independent Music Awards for Best New Age Album. Ciani was also an inaugural member of the Independent Music Awards' judging panel to support independent artists.\n\nIn 2014, she started a Kickstarter campaign to fund a documentary movie on her life as an electronic music pioneer. The campaign was successful, and the award-winning film, titled \"A Life in Waves\", had its premiere on March 12, 2017 at the South by Southwest Festival, did the festival rounds and is now released on DVD.\n\nIn 2016, Ciani released \"Sunergy\", a collaboration using Buchla synthesizers with the musician Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith, as part of the RVNG Intl. FRKWYS Series.\n\nIn 2017, Ciani was awarded the 2017 Moog Music Innovation Award, to be awarded at Moogfest later in the year.\n\nOn her birthday June 4th, 2018, Ciani with producer KamranV released \"LIVE Quadraphonic\" with a numbered Quadraphonic vinyl package available for direct pre-order and at Ace Hotel locations around the world. The performance, recorded live at Gray Area in San Francisco on March 5, 2016, was her first solo Buchla synthesizer performance in 40 years, beginning a string of exclusively quadraphonic performances around the world at events including Ableton LOOP, Marfa Myths, MOCA Detroit, Moogfest, Terraforma, Red Bull Music Academy, Sonar, and SXSW. This release was the first quadraphonic vinyl release in over 30 years.\n\nSuzanne’s performance at Gray Area, like every other since that day have been in the long forgotten Quadraphonic format; the earliest true 360° listening format of which the original Buchla 200 synthesizer natively output via the Buchla 227 quad output module. Since that performance, a global array of sonic experts have worked together to rebirth this Quadraphonic vinyl LP.\n\nFor this experimental release and inspired by the Buchla 227 quad output module, there is a limited edition of only 227 LPs, numbered, 45 rpm, 180g quadraphonic vinyl discs sold, plus a custom quadraphonic hardware decoder made in collaboration with Involve Audio to decode two channels of audio from the vinyl disc back to the four-channel recording. The vinyl discs were pressed at Jack White’s Third Man Pressing plant in Detroit, MI and are fully compatible for play with any vinyl playback systems in stereo. Current owners of vintage Regular Matrix quadraphonic receivers (and to a slightly less accurate degree Dolby Pro Logic II receivers in music mode) may also listen to \"LIVE Quadraphonic\" in quad via any format: digital download, streaming, radio broadcast or vinyl.\n\nTo celebrate Suzanne Ciani’s LIVE Quadraphonic release, dublab live broadcast the album from its vinyl test pressing as a part of its annual pledge drive, June 4th, 2018 at Noon Pacific Time. The nearly 20-year-old nonprofit pioneer of online radio also had Suzanne live on-the-air for a live interview.\n\n\nStudio albums\n\n\n\nCompilations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The chalice is of Anglo-Saxon design, and has probably been at Kremsmünster Abbey, Austria since shortly after it was made.\n\nDating from c. 770-790 AD, the chalice was donated by Liutperga, wife of the Bavarian Duke Tassilo III, possibly on the occasion of the establishment of the Benedictine Abbey at Kremsmünster in 777.\n\nThe chalice is composed of an egg-shaped cup, a large knop (ornamental knob), and a relatively narrow foot (base). The chalice is cast in bronze that has been gilded with gold and silver and decorated by various methods, including niello engraving and chip-carving. It stands 25.5 cm high, and weighs 3.05 kg; its cup holds approximately 1.75 litres.\n\nThe interlinked oval medallions round the cup show Christ (together with the initials \"I\" and \"S\", for \"Iesus Salvator\") and four Evangelist portraits, each Evangelist with his symbol. Round the base are icons of the Virgin Mary, John the Baptist, and, according to an uncertain interpretation, the Lombard queen Theodolinda. The interlace decoration which covers most of the rest of the exterior contains some animals. Around the foot is the Latin inscription: TASSILO DUX FORTIS + LIVTPIRG VIRGA REGALIS.\n\nThe chalice is an outstanding and original object, possibly made by Northumbrian craftsmen, decorated with Hiberno-Saxon ornament typical of the period. The style is more typical of the Anglo-Saxon rather than Irish component of this hybrid style. There is evidence that monks themselves were trained as goldsmiths in the insular period, like St. Dunstan, a 10th-century Archbishop of Canterbury, and Salzburg for example, was a centre of the Anglo-Saxon mission.\n\nThe care and artistry with which it was worked and the rich decoration show that it was the product of the highest craftsmanship of the day. Although church synods held in the 8th and 9th centuries expressly prohibited the use of copper and bronze for use in consecrated chalices, this is one of a few surviving examples of such vessels from that time.\n\nThe character of the ornamentation shows clearly the predominance of Insular and Anglo-Saxon influences, even though it may have been made on the Continent. Its place of manufacture is uncertain, and it may have been produced in northern Italy, but Mondsee or Salzburg have also been suggested. Together with the Ardagh Chalice and the Derrynaflan Chalice and associated paten, all of Irish origin, it is one of the most impressive of the very few surviving large pieces of Insular church metalwork – most examples of the style are secular brooches. Anglo-Saxon metalwork was highly regarded as far away as Italy, and especially noted for its engraving, but even fewer pieces have survived than from Ireland.\n\n"}

The Thing was launched as a mailbox system accessible over the telephone network in New York feeding a Bulletin Board System (BBS) in 1991 before their website was launched in 1995 on the World Wide Web. By the late 1990s, The Thing grew into a diverse online community made up of dozens of members' Web sites, mailing lists, a successful Web hosting service, a community studio in Chelsea (NYC), and the first Web site devoted to Net Art: bbs.thing.net.\n\nIn 1991, The Thing began as a Bulletin Board System (BBS) focusing on contemporary art and cultural theory. In 1990, the writer and critic Blackhawk (having recently produced the film \"Cyberpunk\") taught Wolfgang Staehle many of the abilities he needed to start the original The Thing BBS. Blackhawk was the first person Staehle turned to after conceiving the idea for an electronic culture resource based on the model of Joseph Beuys's \"Social sculpture\". Blackhawk and Wolfgang jointly set up the editorial structure of the original BBS and planned for many of the then experimental activities that took place. Other people who helped develop and shape the content of the early BBS included Josefina Ayerza, Dike Blair, Donald Newman, the original programmer, Jordan Crandall, David Platzker, Josh Decter, Rainer Ganahl, Julia Scher, Barry Schwabsky, Morgan Garwood, Franz von Stauffenberg and Benjamin Weil.\n\nA second node, The Thing Cologne, was added in 1992, followed by The Thing Vienna in November 1993. Nodes in Berlin and elsewhere were soon to follow.\n\nThe Thing changed its form when a website was created for a presentation at the 1995 Ars Electronica. Credits on the 1995 website also name Nicky Chaikin, John F. Simon Jr., Wolfgang Staehle, Rob Keenan, Darryl Erentzen and John Rabasa.\n\nIn 1995 The Thing set up an independent art network with hardware of its own that offered arts communities ways to establish themselves, to send information to one another and also to conceive of new artistic practices deriving from conceptual art and from performance art. The idea was that working with the Internet was a way to operate around the institutions of art distribution of the day.\n\nIn 1998 Max Kossatz designed \"The Thing Communicator\" a website mimicking many functions of the original BBS including member login, chat and messaging.\n\nThe most interactive area of The Thing consisted of various message boards offering forums for art theory debate, news and gossip, ongoing dialogue and an open-access flow of information as well as several online versions of art journals.\n\nAlongside discussion forums The Thing has offered artworks in the form of graphics downloadable to the home personal computer – for example by Peter Halley.\n\nThe Thing has enabled a diverse group of artists, critics, curators, and activists to use the internet in its early stages. At its core, The Thing is a social network, made up of individuals from diverse backgrounds with a wide range of expert knowledge. From this social hub, The Thing has built an array of programs and initiatives, in both technological and cultural networks. During its first five years, TT became widely recognized as one of the founding and leading online centers for new media culture. Its activities include hosting artists' projects and mailing lists - as well as publishing cultural criticism.\n\nThe Thing has also organized many public events and symposia on such topics as the state of new media arts, the preservation of online privacy, artistic innovations in robotics, and the possibilities of community empowerment through wireless technologies.\n\nIn 1997, thing.net communications, LLC, an Internet Service Provider (ISP) was incorporated by Wolfgang Staehle, Gisela Ehrenfried and Max Kossatz. The ISP was to provide a financial backbone for The Thing Inc.

{"id": "10833249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10833249", "title": "Visual ethics", "text": "Visual ethics\n\nVisual ethics is an emerging interdisciplinary field of scholarship that brings together religious studies, philosophy, photo and video journalism, visual arts, and cognitive science in order to explore the ways human beings relate to others ethically through visual perception. Historically, the field of ethics has relied heavily on rational-linguistic approaches, largely ignoring the importance of seeing and visual representation to human moral behavior. At the same time, studies in visual culture tend to analyze imagistic representations while ignoring many of the ethical dimensions involved. Visual ethics is a field of cross-fertilization of ethics and visual culture studies that seeks to understand how the production and reception of visual images is always ethical, whether or not we are consciously aware of this fact.\n\nOn the one hand, visual ethics is concerned with ethical issues involved in the production of visual images. For example, how do representations in newsmedia deploy cultural codes of race, class, ethnicity, gender, and so on in order to create distance from or empathy with specific people and groups? How can visual representations of the other facilitate or foreclose certain ethical responses from viewers? When is it ethically justifiable to capture and share images of another person in a moment of vulnerability? With whom should such images be shared?\n\nVisual ethics is equally concerned with the ethics of reception, that is, with seeing as an ethical act. How do different images influence our ethical responses and moral behavior in different ways? To what extent do our ethical responses to images take place pre-reflectively, by visual-perceptual processes in the body-mind, before images even come to consciousness? It can be looked upon more into the cultural perception. It always depends on the cultural background.\n\nThis topic focuses on ethical theories and methods of ethical reasoning. Controversies and arguments abound as ethical decisions, or the lack thereof, continue to play a role in institutional practice. With the increasing gap between commerce and culture, the prioritization of good business over public service creates an increasingly blurry set of ethical guidelines. Collector-based exhibitions, conflicts of interest, and the de-accessioning practices of collections. One might ask do museums have a responsibility to their public? And if so, is this a part of institutional culture and is it being taught in today’s museum studies programs? Elaine A. King and co-editor Gail Levin addressed many of these issues in the anthology they compiled titled \"Ethics and The Visual Arts\" published in September 2006 by Allworth Press in New York. This volume of 19 essays explores a diverse range of topics about ethics in the visual arts. The dark side of the arts is explored in this volume with nineteen diverse essays by such distinguished authors as Eric Fischl, Suzaan Boettger, Stephen Weil, Richard Serra, and more cover a broad range of topics facing today’s artists, policy makers, art lawyers, galleries, museum professionals, and more.\n\nIn April 2007, under the direction of Timothy Beal of the Baker-Nord Center for the Humanities and William E. Deal of the Inamori Center for Ethics at Case Western Reserve University hosted an interdisciplinary group of scholars in the fields of philosophical ethics, religious studies, theology, visual culture studies, neuroscience, and cognitive science to develop the first research collaboration on visual ethics.\n\nAlthough Visual ethics is an emerging scholarly field, certain books in the fields of ethics, visual culture, and cognitive science have proven particularly influential thus far.\n\n\n"}
