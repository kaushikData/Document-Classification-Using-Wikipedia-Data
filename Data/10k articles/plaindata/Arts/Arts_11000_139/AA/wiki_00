The daughter of filmmaker Dario Argento, she had roles in the films \"XXX\" (2002), \"Land of the Dead\" (2005) and \"Marie Antoinette\" (2006). She has won two David di Donatello awards for Best Actress for \"Let's Not Keep in Touch\" (1994) and \"Traveling Companion\" (1996).\n\nAfter the Weinstein scandal in 2017, she became a leader of the \"#MeToo\" women's rights movement. In August 2018, \"The New York Times\" detailed allegations that Argento sexually assaulted actor Jimmy Bennett in 2013 when he was 17 and she was 37; Argento denied the allegations.\n\nHer father is Dario Argento, an Italian film director, producer and screenwriter, well known for his work in the Italian giallo genre and for his influence on modern horror and slasher movies. Her mother is actress Daria Nicolodi and her maternal great-grandfather was composer Alfredo Casella.\n\nWhen Argento was born in Rome, the city registry office refused to acknowledge \"Asia\" as an appropriate name, and instead officially inscribed her as \"Aria\" (a name accepted by the city registry). She nonetheless always went by the name Asia, which she later used professionally. Argento has said that as a child she was lonely and depressed, owing in part to her parents' work. Her father used to read her his horror scripts as bedtime stories. At age eight, Argento published a book of poems. At the age of 14, she ran away from home.\n\nArgento has mentioned in interviews that she does not have a close relationship with her father. She has mentioned that he was absent when she was a child, and has also mentioned that, because of this, she did not have a happy childhood. Regarding her relationship with her father and her reason for acting, she has stated that:\n\nIn an interview with \"Filmmaker\" magazine, she stated that, at one time, \"I was sick for a while; I was agoraphobic. I was afraid to go out of my apartment for a long time, I could only go out to work.\" \n\nAsia Argento began to act at the age of nine, when she was cast in a small role in a film by Sergio Citti. When she was 18, she starred in her father's film \"Trauma\" (1993). She received the David di Donatello (Italy's version of the Academy Award) for Best Actress in 1994 for her performance in \"Perdiamoci di vista\", and again in 1996 for \"Compagna di viaggio\", which also earned her a Grolla d'oro award. Argento subsequently began to appear in English-language movies, such as \"B. Monkey\" and \"New Rose Hotel\" (both 1998). Argento also performed in French-language roles, beginning with Charlotte de Sauve \"La Reine Margot\" (1994).\n\nAround the same time, she made her first foray into directing with the short films \"Prospettive\" and \"A ritroso\" (both 1994) and a documentary about her father (in 1996) and Abel Ferrara (in 1998). In 2000, Argento directed and wrote her first fiction feature film, \"Scarlet Diva\" (2000), which her father co-produced. In a review, \"Filmmaker\" magazine called the film \"riotously funny\" and dubbed Argento \"a filmmaker with a great degree of promise.\"\n\nShe achieved wider recognition when she portrayed Russian undercover spy Yelena in the Hollywood action film \"xXx\" (2002), alongside Vin Diesel. The film grossed $277.4 million and launched Argento to international fame. She directed her second feature film, \"The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things\" (2004), based on a book by JT LeRoy, the pen name of Laura Albert. According to a \"Paris Review\" interview with Laura Albert, Argento and Savannah Knoop (who played the role of JT's public persona) became lovers.\n\nIn addition to her cinematic accomplishments, Argento has written a number of stories for magazines such as \"Dynamo\" and \"L'Espresso\", while her first novel, titled \"I Love You Kirk\", was published in Italy in 1999. She has modeled for the denim jeans brand Miss Sixty. She became a fan of the band Hondo Maclean when they wrote a track named after her and liked the track so much that she sent them pictures which they used as the cover of their 2003 album \"Plans for a Better Day\".\n\nShe appeared in Placebo's music video for \"This Picture\", and appeared on Placebo frontman Brian Molko's cover version of \"Je t'aime... moi non plus\". Argento has also starred in Catherine Breillat's period drama \"The Last Mistress\". She dubbed the Italian version of the video game \"Mirror's Edge\" in the role of the runner Faith Connors, from 2008 to 2009.\n\nArgento has been part of the Legendary Tiger Man's project \"Femina\", which was released on 14 September 2009. She is featured on the song \"Life Ain't Enough for You\", which was released as a single along with the B-side \"My stomach is the most violent of all Italy\", in which she also contributes vocals.\n\nIn May 2013, Argento's debut album, entitled \"Total Entropy\", was released by Nuun Music.\n\nIn 2014, Argento played supporting role in the British film \"Shongram\", a fictional romantic drama based around the factual and historical events of the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War.\n\nAlso in 2014, she directed her third feature film, titled \"Misunderstood\" (2014), was selected to compete in the Un Certain Regard section at that year's Cannes Film Festival. That year, while promoting the film, Argento stated that she was through with acting and that she had made the decision to focus her energies on writing and directing.\n\nBesides Italian, Argento speaks English and French, which she learned for her role in \"Les Morsures de L'Aube\".\n\nHer first child, Anna Lou, was born in 2001. Italian rock and roll musician Marco Castoldi (lead singer of Bluvertigo), also known as Morgan, is the father. She named her daughter after her half-sister Anna Ceroli, who died in a motorcycle accident.\n\nArgento married film director Michele Civetta on 27 August 2008 in Arezzo. Her second child, Nicola Giovanni, was born in 2008 in Rome. The couple divorced in 2013. She and her children live in Vigna Clara neighborhood of Rome.\n\nIn early 2017, it was reported by several Italian news sources that Argento was in a relationship with celebrity chef and host of \"\" Anthony Bourdain. Bourdain died of an apparent suicide in Kaysersberg-Vignoble, Haut-Rhin, France, on 8 June 2018.\n\nArgento alleged in an October 2017 \"New Yorker\" article by Ronan Farrow that she had been sexually assaulted by Harvey Weinstein in the 1990s. She also said that she had consensual sexual relations with him multiple times over the course of the next five years. She confirmed that a scene in \"Scarlet Diva\" where her character is accosted by a movie executive was indeed a reference to Weinstein. Later, Argento stated that the \"article did a huge disservice to me and to my truth by simplifying all this,\" and accused Farrow of \"misrepresenting\" what happened to her.\n\nAfter being criticised for her account in Italian media and politics, Argento moved to Germany to escape what she described as a culture of \"victim blaming\" in Italy.\n\nArgento delivered a speech on 20 May 2018, following the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, calling the festival Weinstein's \"hunting ground\", alleging that she was raped by Weinstein in Cannes when she was 21. She added, \"And even tonight, sitting among you, there are those who still have to be held accountable for their conduct against women.\"\n\nOn 19 August 2018, \"The New York Times\" published allegations that Argento sexually assaulted actor Jimmy Bennett, then 17, in a California hotel suite in 2013; she was 37 at the time. Argento had first met Bennett when he played Argento's son in the 2004 film \"The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things\" when Bennett was seven years old. According to Bennett, in their 2013 encounter Argento gave him alcohol, performed oral sex on him and engaged him in sexual intercourse; she later paid him $380,000 as a settlement.\n\nArgento denied the allegation of sexual assault. She said that she never had a sexual encounter with Bennett, and that when he made a request for money to her, her partner Anthony Bourdain paid him to avoid negative publicity. Following Argento's denials, a photograph of her topless in bed with Bennett was published, as well as her alleged admission of sex with him in text messages to Rain Dove. In a letter published online in September 2018, Argento's attorney admits there was a sexual encounter, but claims that Bennett \"sexually attacked\" Argento. Amid the allegations, it was announced Argento has been dropped as a judge on \"X-Factor Italy\".\n\nIn 2012, Argento was highlighted in the retrospective \"Argento: Il Cinema Nel Sangue\" at the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City. The retrospective celebrated the influence of the Argento family on filmmaking in Italy and around the world. It highlighted Asia's contribution as well as that of her and mother (Daria Nicolodi), father, grandfather (Salvatore), and uncle (Claudio).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5020882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5020882", "title": "B. C. Stephenson", "text": "B. C. Stephenson\n\nBenjamin Charles Stephenson or B. C. Stephenson (1839 – 22 January 1906) was an English dramatist, lyricist and librettist. After beginning a career in the civil service, he started to write for the theatre, using the pen name \"Bolton Rowe\". He was author or co-author of several long-running shows of the Victorian theatre. His biggest hit was the comic opera \"Dorothy\", which set records for the length of its original run.\n\nHis writing collaborators included Clement Scott and Brandon Thomas, and composers with whom he worked included Frederic Clay, Alfred Cellier and Sir Arthur Sullivan with whom he wrote \"The Zoo\", which continues to be revived today.\n\nStephenson, the son of Sir William Henry Stephenson, came from a family with a history of public service, both civil and military. His grandfather, also named Benjamin Charles Stephenson, was a major-general and later one of the Commissioners of Woods and Forests. Stephenson's father became a civil servant, rising to become chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue. The young Stephenson was commissioned into the Middlesex Militia and later entered the civil service.\n\nWhile working as a civil servant, Stephenson began writing theatrical pieces. His grandfather, General B. C. Stephenson, had lived and died at a house in Bolton Row, Mayfair, and the young Stephenson adopted \"Bolton Rowe\" as his pen name. Stephenson's first works were collaborations with the composer Frederic Clay in three pieces played by amateurs, \"The Pirate's Isle\", \"Out of Sight\" and \"The Bold Recruit\" (1868). The last of these was repeated at a benefit, produced by Thomas German Reed, at the Gallery of Illustration in 1870 as a companion piece to Clay and W.S. Gilbert's \"Ages Ago\". Stephenson's first professional success came at the same venue, two years later, with a short operetta, written with the composer Alfred Cellier, \"Charity Begins at Home\". The piece was in the company's repertory for most of 1872, and was played more than 200 times.\n\nStephenson was still using the pseudonym \"Bolton Rowe\" when he wrote the libretto for Arthur Sullivan's one-act comic opera \"The Zoo\" in 1875. This work is still played today with some frequency. He then began a writing partnership with Clement Scott, who adopted the matching pen name, \"Saville Rowe\" (after Savile Row, another Mayfair street). Together, for the Bancrofts at the Prince of Wales's Theatre, they wrote English versions of Victorien Sardou's plays, \"Nos intimes\" (as \"Peril\") and \"Dora\" (1878 as \"Diplomacy\"). The latter was described by the theatrical paper \"The Era\" as \"the great dramatic hit of the season\". It also played with success at Wallack's Theatre in New York. Stephenson and Scott wrote an English version of Halévy and Meilhac's libretto for Lecocq's operette, \"Le Petit Duc\". Their adaptation so pleased the composer that he volunteered to write some new music for the English production.\n\nIn 1880, Stephenson's work again featured in New York. The reopened Broadway Opera House was inaugurated with a double bill of \"Ages Ago\" and \"Charity Begins at Home\". Stephenson also supplied the libretto for a three-act grand opera version of Longfellow's \"The Masque of Pandora\", composed by Alfred Cellier, and presented in Boston in 1881. The next year in London, Stephenson collaborated with Brandon Thomas on a \"new and critical comedy\", \"Comrades\", for the Court Theatre, with a cast including Arthur Cecil, D. G. Boucicault and Marion Terry. Writing under his real name for the first time, Stephenson had a great success in 1882–83 with his play \"Impulse\", based on \"La Maison du mari\" by Xavier de Montépin, which opened in December 1882 and ran through most of the next year. In 1886, he adapted \"Der Probepfeil\" by Oscar Blumenthal as \"A Woman of the World\", which was staged at the Haymarket Theatre, starring Herbert Beerbohm Tree and Helen Barry.\n\nIn 1886 Stephenson had his greatest success. He and Cellier wrote the comic opera \"Dorothy\". The piece opened at the Gaiety Theatre on 25 September 1886, receiving lukewarm notices. Much of Cellier's score was reused material from an earlier failure, and neither the music nor the libretto attracted critical praise. \"The Times\" wrote, \"Gentility reigns supreme, and with it unfortunately also a good deal of the refined feebleness and the ineptitude which are the defects of that quality.\" Stephenson and Cellier revised the work, and it transferred in December to the Prince of Wales Theatre with new stars, including Marie Tempest. \"Dorothy\" became a great success at the box office and transferred in 1888 to the Lyric Theatre, where it ran until 1889. Its initial run of a total of 931 performances was the longest of any piece of musical theatre up to that time. Some critics reconsidered their earlier condemnation, the work became regarded as a classic Victorian piece, and the initially despised plot was traced seriously back to the Restoration playwrights David Garrick and Aphra Behn, and to Oliver Goldsmith and even Shakespeare. Stephenson and Cellier later collaborated on another comic opera, \"Doris\" (1888), which, without rivalling \"Dorothy\", had a good run of more than 200 performances.\n\nStephenson's later work in musical theatre was less successful. For the Carl Rosa Opera Company he rewrote the libretto for \"The Golden Web\", an opera bouffe by the composer Arthur Goring Thomas, which was first heard in 1893. In spite of some positive critical attention, interest in the piece was short-lived. The same year, two short operettas with music by Edward Jakobowski, \"The Improvisatore\" and \"A Venetian Singer\", made little impact. \"The Ranch\", a musical farce with music by Edward Solomon, failed to find a theatre to stage it. A libretto for Charles Villiers Stanford, \"Christopher Patch, The Barber of Bath\", was set by Stanford but has never been performed. A libretto for Sir Alexander Mackenzie remained, as McKenzie put it in 1898, \"still in my desk\".\n\nIn the non-musical theatre, Stephenson continued to prosper. By the 1890s he was sufficiently well known that his name as author of a play lent cachet. In 1892 one British newspaper protested that a new play, advertised as the work of Stephenson and Augustus Harris, was in fact the work of less-known writers. In the same year, Stephenson produced one of his more enduring works, \"Faithful James\", a one act comedy. It supplanted Gilbert's \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern\" in a triple bill running at the Court Theatre. The cast included Weedon Grossmith, Brandon Thomas, Ellaline Terriss and Sybil Grey. Among later revivals of the play was one in 1907 with Rutland Barrington in the title role of the bumbling butler. In 1894, Stephenson co-wrote a melodrama with Haddon Chambers, \"The Fatal Card\", which was well received. Asked how he and his collaborator worked together, he said, \"We divide the labour. I write all the vowels and Mr Chambers all the consonants.\"\n\nAmong revivals of Stephenson's works, during his life and after, were \"Dorothy\" (on several occasions, notably in 1908, when the critic of \"The Times\" called it \"one of the most tuneful, most charming, and most shapely of English comic operas\") and \"Diplomacy\", which was given in command performances for Queen Victoria in 1893 and George V in 1914, and was revived again in 1924, starring Gladys Cooper.\n\nStephenson died in Taplow, Berkshire, at the age of 66.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4802982", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4802982", "title": "Ballets Russes", "text": "Ballets Russes\n\nThe Ballets Russes () was an itinerant ballet company based in Paris that performed between 1909 and 1929 throughout Europe and on tours to North and South America. The company never performed in Russia, where the Revolution disrupted society. After its initial Paris season, the company had no formal ties there.\n\nOriginally conceived by impresario Sergei Diaghilev, the Ballets Russes is widely regarded as the most influential ballet company of the 20th century, in part because it promoted ground-breaking artistic collaborations among young choreographers, composers, designers, and dancers, all at the forefront of their several fields. Diaghilev commissioned works from composers such as Igor Stravinsky, Claude Debussy, and Sergei Prokofiev, artists such as Vasily Kandinsky, Alexandre Benois, Pablo Picasso, and Henri Matisse, and costume designers Léon Bakst and Coco Chanel.\n\nThe company's productions created a huge sensation, completely reinvigorating the art of performing dance, bringing many visual artists to public attention, and significantly affecting the course of musical composition. It also introduced European and American audiences to tales, music, and design motifs drawn from Russian folklore. The influence of the Ballets Russes lasts to the present day.\n\nThe French plural form of the name, \"“Ballets Russes,”\" specifically refers to the company founded by Sergei Diaghilev and active during his lifetime. (In some publicity the company was advertised as \"Les Ballets Russes de Serge Diaghileff.\") In English, the company is now commonly referred to as \"the Ballets Russes\" (plural, without italics), although in the early part of the 20th century, it was sometimes referred to as “The Russian Ballet” or “Diaghilev’s Russian Ballet.” To add to the confusion, some publicity material spelled the name in the singular.\n\nThe names “Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo” and “The Original Ballet Russe” (using the singular) refer to companies that formed after Diaghilev's death in 1929.\n\nSergei Diaghilev, the company's impresario (or \"artistic director\" in modern terms), was chiefly responsible for its success. He was uniquely prepared for the role; born into a wealthy Russian family of vodka distillers (though they went bankrupt when he was 18), he was accustomed to moving in the upper-class circles that provided the company's patrons and benefactors.\n\nIn 1890, he enrolled at the Faculty of Law, St. Petersburg, to prepare for a career in the civil service like many Russian young men of his class. There he was introduced (through his cousin Dmitry Filosofov) to a student clique of artists and intellectuals calling themselves The Nevsky Pickwickians whose most influential member was Alexandre Benois; others included Léon Bakst, Walter Nouvel, and Konstantin Somov.From childhood, Diaghilev had been passionately interested in music. However, his ambition to become a composer was dashed in 1894 when Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov told him he had no talent.\n\nIn 1898, several members of The Pickwickians founded the journal \"Mir iskusstva\" (\"World of Art\") under the editorship of Diaghilev. As early as 1902, \"Mir iskusstva\" included reviews of concerts, operas, and ballets in Russia. The latter were chiefly written by Benois, who exerted considerable influence on Diaghilev's thinking. \"Mir iskusstva\" also sponsored exhibitions of Russian art in St. Petersburg, culminating in Diaghilev's important 1905 show of Russian portraiture at the Tauride Palace.\n\nFrustrated by the extreme conservatism of the Russian art world, Diaghilev organized the groundbreaking \"Exhibition of Russian Art\" at the Petit Palais in Paris in 1906, the first major showing of Russian art in the West. Its enormous success created a Parisian fascination with all things Russian. Diaghilev organized a 1907 season of Russian music at the Paris Opéra. In 1908, Diaghilev returned to the Paris Opéra with six performances of Modest Mussorgsky's opera \"Boris Godunov,\" starring basso Fyodor Chaliapin. This was Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's 1908 version (with additional cuts and re-arrangement of the scenes). The performances were a sensation, though the costs of producing grand opera were crippling. \n\nIn 1909, Diaghilev presented his first Paris \"Saison Russe\" devoted exclusively to ballet (although the company did not use the name \"Ballets Russes\" until the following year). Most of this original company were resident performers at the Imperial Ballet of Saint Petersburg, hired by Diaghilev to perform in Paris during the Imperial Ballet's summer holidays. The first season's repertory featured a variety of works chiefly choreographed by Michel Fokine, including \"Le Pavillon d'Armide\", the \"Polovtsian Dances\" (from \"Prince Igor\"), \"Les Sylphides\", and \"Cléopâtre\". The season also included \"Le Festin\", a pastiche set by several choreographers (including Fokine) to music by several Russian composers. \n\nThe principal productions are shown in the table below.\n\nWhen Sergei Diaghilev died of diabetes in Venice on 19 August 1929, the Ballets Russes was left with substantial debts. As the Great Depression began, its property was claimed by its creditors and the company of dancers dispersed.\n\nIn 1931, Colonel Wassily de Basil (a Russian émigré entrepreneur from Paris) and René Blum (ballet director at the Monte Carlo Opera) founded the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, giving its first performances there in 1932. Diaghilev alumni Léonide Massine and George Balanchine worked as choreographers with the company and Tamara Toumanova was a principal dancer.\n\nArtistic differences led to a split between Blum and de Basil, after which de Basil renamed his company initially \"Ballets Russes de Colonel W. de Basil\". Blum retained the name \"Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo\", while de Basil created a new company. In 1938, he called it \"The Covent Garden Russian Ballet\" and then renamed it the \"Original Ballet Russe\" in 1939.\n\nAfter World War II began, the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo left Europe and toured extensively in the United States and South America. As dancers retired and left the company, they often founded dance studios in the United States or South America or taught at other former company dancers' studios. With Balanchine's founding of the School of American Ballet, and later the New York City Ballet, many outstanding former Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo dancers went to New York to teach in his school. When they toured the United States, Cyd Charisse, the film actress and dancer, was taken into the cast.\n\nThe Original Ballet Russe toured mostly in Europe. Its alumni were influential in teaching classical Russian ballet technique in European schools.\n\nThe successor companies were the subject of the 2005 documentary film \"Ballets Russes\".\n\nThe Ballets Russes was noted for the high standard of its dancers, most of whom had been classically trained at the great Imperial schools in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Their high technical standards contributed a great deal to the company's success in Paris, where dance technique had declined markedly since the 1830s.\n\nPrincipal female dancers included: Anna Pavlova, Tamara Karsavina, Olga Spessivtseva, Mathilde Kschessinska, Ida Rubinstein, Bronislava Nijinska, Lydia Lopokova, Diana Gould and Alicia Markova, among others; many earned international renown with the company. Prima ballerina Xenia Makletzova was dismissed from the company in 1916 and sued by Diaghilev; she countersued for breach of contract, and won $4500 in a Massachusetts court.\n\nThe Ballets Russes was even more remarkable for raising the status of the male dancer, largely ignored by choreographers and ballet audiences since the early 19th century. Among the male dancers were Michel Fokine, Serge Lifar, Léonide Massine, Anton Dolin, George Balanchine, Valentin Zeglovsky, Theodore Kosloff, Adolph Bolm, and the legendary Vaslav Nijinsky, considered the most popular and talented dancer in the company's history.\n\nAfter the Russian Revolution of 1917, in later years, younger dancers were taken from those trained in Paris by former Imperial dancers, within the large community of Russian exiles. Recruits were even accepted from America and included a young Ruth Page who joined the troupe in Monte Carlo during 1925.\n\nThe company featured and premiered now-famous (and sometimes notorious) works by the great choreographers Marius Petipa and Michel Fokine, as well as new works by Vaslav Nijinsky, Bronislava Nijinska, Léonide Massine, and the young George Balanchine at the start of his career.\n\nThe choreography of Michel Fokine was of paramount importance in the initial success of the Ballets Russes. Fokine had graduated from the Imperial Ballet School in Saint Petersburg in 1898, and eventually become First Soloist at the Mariinsky Theater. In 1907, Fokine choreographed his first work for the Imperial Russian Ballet, \"Le Pavillon d'Armide\". In the same year, he created \"Chopiniana\" to piano music by the composer Frédéric Chopin as orchestrated by Alexander Glazunov. This was an early example of creating choreography to an existing score rather than to music specifically written for the ballet, a departure from the normal practice at the time.\n\nFokine established an international reputation with his works choreographed during the first four seasons (1909–1912) of the Ballets Russes. These included the \"Polovtsian Dances\" (from \"Prince Igor\"), \"Le Pavillon d'Armide\" (a revival of his 1907 production for the Imperial Russian Ballet), \"Les Sylphides\" (a reworking of his earlier \"Chopiniana\"), \"The Firebird\", \"Le Spectre de la Rose\", \"Petrushka\", and \"Daphnis and Chloé\" . After a longstanding tumultuous relationship with Diaghilev, Fokine left the Ballets Russes at the end of the 1912 season.\n\nVaslav Nijinsky had attended the Imperial Ballet School, St. Petersburg since the age of eight. He graduated in 1907 and joined the Imperial Ballet where he immediately began to take starring roles. Diaghilev invited him to join the Ballets Russes for its first Paris season.\n\nIn 1912, Diaghilev gave Nijinsky his first opportunity as a choreographer, for his production of \"L'Après-midi d'un faune\" to Claude Debussy's symphonic poem \"Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune\". Featuring Nijinsky himself as the Faun, the ballet's frankly erotic nature caused a sensation. The following year, Nijinsky choreographed a new work by Debussy composed expressly for the Ballets Russes, \"Jeux\". Indifferently received by the public, \"Jeux\" was eclipsed two weeks later by the premiere of Igor Stravinsky's \"The Rite of Spring\" (\"Le Sacre du printemps\"), also choreographed by Nijinsky.\nBecause of mental illness, Nijinsky eventually retired from dance; he was diagnosed with schizophrenia.\nLéonide Massine was born in Moscow, where he studied both acting and dancing at the Imperial School. On the verge of becoming an actor, Massine was invited by Sergei Diaghilev to join the Ballets Russes, as he was seeking a replacement for Vaslav Nijinsky. Diaghilev encouraged Massine's creativity and his entry into choreography.\n\nMassine's most famous creations for the Ballets Russes were \"Parade\", \"El sombrero de tres picos\", and \"Pulcinella\". In all three of these works, he collaborated with Pablo Picasso, who designed the sets and costumes.\nMassine extended Fokine's choreographic innovations, especially those relating to narrative and character. His ballets incorporated both folk dance and \"demi-charactère\" dance, a style using classical technique to perform character dance. Massine created contrasts in his choreography, such as synchronized yet individual movement, or small-group dance patterns within the \"corps de ballet\".\nBronislava Nijinska was the younger sister of Vaslav Nijinsky. She trained at the Imperial Ballet School in St. Petersburg, joining the Imperial Ballet company in 1908. From 1909, she (like her brother) was a member of Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes.\n\nIn 1915, Nijinska and her husband fled to Kiev to escape World War I. There, she founded the École de movement, where she trained Ukrainian artists in modern dance. Her most prominent pupil was Serge Lifar (who later joined the Ballets Russes in 1923).\n\nFollowing the Russian Revolution, Nijinska fled again to Poland, and then, in 1921, re-joined the Ballets Russes in Paris. In 1923, Diaghilev assigned her the choreography of Stravinsky's \"Les Noces.\" The result combines elements of her brother's choreography for \"The Rite of Spring\" with more traditional aspects of ballet, such as dancing \"en pointe.\" The following year, she choreographed three new works for the company: \"Les biches\", \"Les Fâcheux\", and \"Le train bleu\".\n\nBorn Giorgi Melitonovitch Balanchivadze in Saint Petersburg, George Balanchine was trained at the Imperial School of Ballet. His education there was interrupted by the Russian Revolution of 1917. Balanchine graduated in 1921, after the school reopened. He subsequently studied music theory, composition, and advanced piano at the Petrograd Conservatory, graduating in 1923. During this time, he worked with the \"corps de ballet\" of the Mariinsky Theater. In 1924, Balanchine (and his first wife, ballerina Tamara Geva) fled to Paris while on tour of Germany with the Soviet State Dancers. He was invited by Sergei Diaghilev to join the Ballets Russes as a choreographer.\nDiaghilev invited the collaboration of contemporary fine artists in the design of sets and costumes. These included Alexandre Benois, Léon Bakst, Nicholas Roerich, Georges Braque, Natalia Goncharova, Mikhail Larionov, Pablo Picasso, Coco Chanel, Henri Matisse, André Derain, Joan Miró, Giorgio de Chirico, Salvador Dalí, Ivan Bilibin, Pavel Tchelitchev, Maurice Utrillo, and Georges Rouault.\n\nTheir designs contributed to the groundbreaking excitement of the company's productions. The scandal caused by the premiere performance in Paris of Stravinsky's \"The Rite of Spring\" has been partly attributed to the provocative aesthetic of the costumes of the Ballets Russes.\n\nAlexandre Benois had been the most influential member of The Nevsky Pickwickians and was one of the original founders (with Bakst and Diaghilev) of \"Mir iskusstva\". His particular interest in ballet as an art form strongly influenced Diaghilev and was seminal in the formation of the Ballets Russes. In addition, Benois contributed scenic and costume designs to several of the company's earlier productions: \"Le Pavillon d'Armide\", portions of \"Le Festin\", and \"Giselle\". Benois also participated with Igor Stravinsky and Michel Fokine in the creation of \"Petrushka\", to which he contributed much of the scenario as well as the stage sets and costumes.\n\nLéon Bakst was also an original member of both The Nevsky Pickwickians and \"Mir iskusstva\". He participated as designer in productions of the Ballets Russes from its beginning in 1909 until 1921, creating sets and costumes for \"Scheherazade\", \"The Firebird\", \"Les Orientales\", \"Le Spectre de la rose\", \"L'Après-midi d'une faune\", and \"Daphnis et Chloé\", among other productions.\n\nIn 1917, Pablo Picasso designed sets and costumes in the Cubist style for three Diaghilev ballets, all with choreography by Léonide Massine: \"Parade\", \"El sombrero de tres picos\", and \"Pulcinella\".\n\nNatalia Goncharova was born in 1881 near Tula, Russia. Her art was inspired by Russian folk art, Fauvism, and cubism. She began designing for the Ballets Russes in 1921.\n\nAlthough the Ballets Russes firmly established the 20th-century tradition of fine art theatre design, the company was not unique in its employment of fine artists. For instance, Savva Mamontov's Private Opera Company had made a policy of employing fine artists, such as Konstantin Korovin and Golovin, who went on to work for the Ballets Russes.\n\nFor his new productions, Diaghilev commissioned the foremost composers of the 20th century, including: Debussy, Milhaud, Poulenc, Prokofiev, Ravel, Satie, Respighi, Stravinsky, de Falla, and Strauss. He was also responsible for commissioning the first two significant British-composed ballets: \"Romeo and Juliet\" (composed in 1925 by nineteen-year-old Constant Lambert) and \"The Triumph of Neptune\" (composed in 1926 by Lord Berners).\n\nThe impresario also engaged conductors who were or became eminent in their field during the 20th century, including Pierre Monteux (1911–16 and 1924), Ernest Ansermet (1915–23), Edward Clark (1919–20) and Roger Désormière (1925–29).\n\nDiaghilev hired the young Stravinsky at a time when he was virtually unknown to compose the music for \"The Firebird\", after the composer Anatoly Lyadov proved unreliable, and this was instrumental in launching Stravinsky's career in Europe and the United States of America.\n\nStravinsky's early ballet scores were the subject of much discussion. \"The Firebird\" (1910) was seen as an astonishingly accomplished work for such a young artist (Debussy is said to have remarked drily: \"Well, you've got to start somewhere!\"). Many contemporary audiences found \"Petrushka\" (1911) to be almost unbearably dissonant and confused. \"The Rite of Spring\" (1913) nearly caused an audience riot. It stunned people because of its willful rhythms and aggressive dynamics. The audience's negative reaction to it is now regarded as a theatrical scandal as notorious as the failed runs of Richard Wagner's \"Tannhäuser\" at Paris in 1861 and Jean-Georges Noverre's \"Les Fêtes Chinoises\" in London on the eve of the Seven Years' War. However, Stravinsky's early ballet scores are now widely considered masterpieces of the genre.\n\nDiaghilev always maintained that no camera could ever do justice to the artistry of his dancers, and it was long believed there was no film legacy of the Ballets Russes. However, in 2011 a 30-second newsreel film of a performance in Montreux, Switzerland, in June 1928 came to light. The ballet was \"Les Sylphides\" and the lead dancer was identified as Serge Lifar.\n\nParis, 2008: In September 2008, on the eve of the 100th anniversary of the creation of the Ballets Russes, Sotheby's announced the staging of an exceptional exhibition of works lent mainly by French, British and Russian private collectors, museums and foundations. Some 150 paintings, designs, costumes, theatre decors, drawings, sculptures, photographs, manuscripts, and programs were exhibited in Paris, retracing the key moments in the history of the Ballets Russes. On display were costumes designed by André Derain (\"La Boutique fantasque\", 1919) and Henri Matisse (\"Le chant du rossignol\", 1920), and Léon Bakst.\n\nPosters recalling the surge of creativity that surrounded the Ballets Russes included Pablo Picasso's iconic image of the Chinese Conjuror for the audacious production of \"Parade\" and Jean Cocteau's poster for \"Le Spectre de la rose\". Costumes and stage designs presented included works by Alexander Benois, for \"Le Pavillon d'Armide\" and \"Petrushka\"; Léon Bakst, for \"La Péri\" and \"Le Dieu bleu\"; Mikhail Larionov, for \"Le Soleil à Minuit\"; and Natalia Goncharova, for \"The Firebird\" (1925 version). The exhibition also included important contemporary artists, whose works reflected the visual heritage of the Ballets Russes – notably an installation made of colorfully painted paper by the renowned Belgian artist Isabelle de Borchgrave, and items from the Imperial Porcelain Factory in St. Petersburg.\n\nMonte-Carlo, 2009: In May, in Monaco, two postage stamps \"Centenary of Ballets Russians of Diaghilev\" went out, created by Georgy Shishkin.\n\nLondon, 2010–11: London's Victoria and Albert Museum presented a special exhibition entitled \"Diaghilev and the Golden Age of the Ballets Russes, 1909–1929\" at the V&A South Kensington between 5 September 2010 and 9 January 2011.\n\nCanberra, 2010–11: An exhibition of the company's costumes held by the National Gallery of Australia was held from 10 December 2010 – 1 May 2011 at the Gallery in Canberra. Entitled \"Ballets Russes: The Art of Costume\", it included 150 costumes and accessories from 34 productions from 1909 to 1939; one third of the costumes had not been seen since they were last worn on stage. Along with costumes by Natalia Goncharova, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, André Derain, Georges Braque, André Masson and Giorgio de Chirico, the exhibition also featured photographs, film, music and artists’ drawings.\n\nWashington, DC, 2013: \"Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes, 1909–1929: When Art Danced with Music.\" National Gallery of Art, East Building Mezzanine. 12 May— 2 September 2013. Organized by the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, in collaboration with the National Gallery of Art, Washington.\n\nStockholm, 2014–2015: \"Sleeping Beauties – Dreams and Costumes\". The Dance Museum in Stockholm owns about 250 original costumes from the Ballets Russes, in this exhibition about fifty of them are shown. (www.dansmuseet.se)\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "56376127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56376127", "title": "Chinsō", "text": "Chinsō\n\nChinsō 頂相 (alternatively pronounced Chinzō) are commemorative portraits of Zen masters, a traditional form of East Asian art, specifically Zen art. They can be painted or sculpted and usually present a Zen master ceremonially dressed and seated upright in chair. Chinsō include realistic portraits of prominent Zen monks, possibly commissioned by them and painted while they were alive or shortly after they died, as well as depictions of famous Zen patriarchs from the pastcommissioned by his disciples.\n\nChinsō were believed to have been passed down by Zen masters to their disciples as a symbol of dharma transmission, and known to have been meant for use in rituals, especially to represent the deceased during memorial services, and as an icon for their followers. Before monks would die, they would sometimes write a simple poem in the upper part of their portrait called eulogy, or have another author or monk write an inscription at the top. In Japan many remaining sculptural Buddhist chinsō are made out of wood, which may explain why so few remain in China and Korea on account of the Huichang persecution when most wooden sculptures perished. Some of the oldest surviving chinsō of Chan masters were brought from China to Japan; about 12 of those are extant.\n\nChinsō flourished during the Song (960-1279) and Yuan (1279-1368) dynasties in China, and were introduced in Japan during the Kamakura period (1185-1333). They are considered historically significant because of their antiquity, preservation and artistic quality. There are about 70 known surviving chinsō from China and Japan from the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries that are designated “national treasures,” but about ten times that number have survived in Japanese museums and temple collections.\n\nChinsō emerged from mainstream traditions of Chinese portraiture during the Song dynasty (960-1279). Nothing visually distinguished them from other portraits done at the time of Chinese elite; the formal qualities were all the same. Chinsō are mainly understood to follow this basic formula: the monk is seated cross legged in a chair, feet hidden, with his shoes on a footstool in front of him, in a three quarter view, and ceremonially dressed with inner and outer robes and a kasaya or surplice draped over his left shoulder. The surplice is can be held together with an ornamental ring right over the monk’s heart. He usually holds something in his right hand, like a whisk, scepter, staff or bamboo. They follow the highest standard for painting at the time. As well as following the same basic formula of Chinese portraiture, chinsō assumed the characteristics of Chinese portraiture in general. These included private ownership, verse inscriptions, their role in social networks. Surviving chinsō also include many works created in Japan once Zen Buddhism was brought there from China.\nWhen Zen Buddhism was brought to Japan from China, the Chinese style of portraiture as well as these traditions surrounding chinsō, were brought with them. This realistic style was not typical in Japan and set chinsō apart from other portraits at the time in Japan because of their high degree of verisimilitude. Although most easily identifiable chinsō have the subject seated in a chair, in three quarter profile against a black background, with an inscription at the top, not all chinsō followed this rigid formula. The portraits of Japanese monks Mokuan Shuyu and Ikkyu Sojun represent this identifiable formula, but the alternative version of Ikkyu Sojun does not. Instead of being seated in three quarter view, the monk or patriarch could be shown frontally, or as a full figure, and could be in a circular frame instead of simply as a figure against a blank background. Less common are chinsō showing a monk in meditation in a landscape setting, where he could be either walking or sitting. Chinsō are usually inscribed at the top with a eulogy written in free verse, describing who the patriarch was, why it was made and possibly who wrote the eulogy and why. Some scholars distinguish chinsō from the soshizō 祖師像 category, which includes portraits of legendary patriarchs from the distant past, by checking whether or not the portrait is inscribed. It’s also important to note that the soshizō were not as realistic as the chinsō.\nChinsō, or dingxiang in Chinese, is a Chinese Buddhist neologism, and was originally a translation for the Sanskrit term uṣṇīṣa. The usnisa is the term coined for the fleshy protuberance on top of the Buddha’s head. In India it was said to be invisible because it is unable to be seen by living beings. During the Song dynasty in China, the term chinsō began being used for portraits of Zen monks as we know the term today. The existence of a protuberance on top of a Buddha’s head represented the fact he had reached enlightenment, similar to how chinsō were thought to prove enlightenment when passed down from a monk to his disciple. \n\nChinsō have been known to serve many purposes throughout their history. The category includes portraits commissioned by the Zen monks themselves and painted while they are alive or shortly after they had died, and portraits commissioned by famous Zen patriarchs’ disciples to be used for worship. Scholars have also concluded that they could have been used as certificates or proof of dharma transmission. By proof of dharma transmission, it is meant that the portraits were thought to have been passed down from Zen master to their disciples when they became enlightened, since dharma transmission is the recognition of the enlightenment in a monk’s successor and the passing down of lineage. This theory has since been questioned by scholars. Since the category of chinsō is so broad and includes portraits used for worship as well as portraits used to represent dharma transmission, the category could use stricter guidelines for classifying portrait as chinsō. The true function of chinsō is under questions by scholars for the purpose of clarifying the category.\n\nMore recently (since about 1994) it has come to the attention of scholars that chinsō were used in a mortuary context, rather than used to certify or authenticate dharma transmission. This was particularly the case in China. They were used after monks had died, meaning that they were used like other icons are: as a receptacle for a deity in a ritual context, like objects of worship in temples. An article by T. Griffith Foulk and Robert Sharf published in 1994 attempted to demystify this part of Zen culture by clarifying that chinsō did not serve as evidence of dharma transmission but are simply a category of Buddhist portraiture used in a mortuary context. Their inscriptions provide possible legitimization to lineage of transmission and possible affiliation, but are said to not have been given for the sole purpose of certifying enlightenment. This argument is supported by their claims that chinsō, unlike more important items for representing transmission like a monk’s robes, were passed out freely in China to “laymen, novices, merchants, and the like”. Their argument goes on to say chinsō could have just been part of the regular gift giving tradition. Different recipients of chinsō include designated dharma heirs associated with specific linages, another meaningful relation to the monk, who received the portrait as a gift or an anonymous person who received the portrait at a fundraiser (a “hauzshu” in Chinese). The purpose and usage of chinsō is still in question by scholars. \n\nSome dharma lineages have been heavily influenced by portraiture. For example, the Portrait of Chikotsu Dai’e established Chikotsu Dai’e 癡兀大慧 (1229-1312) as a disciple of the Chan monk Enni Ben’e 円爾弁円(1202-1280) because the inscription of the chinsō is similar to that of Enni Ben’en’s on his own portrait, and Enni’s is similar to that of his predecessor Wuzun Shifan 無準師範 (1178-1249), a Chinese Chan monk. The portrait of Wuzun Shih-fan was brought by his disciple Enni Ben’en to Japan in 1241 and is one of the oldest surviving chinsō. Chikotsu Dai’e’s portrait thus establishes the genealogical sequence of Wuzun Shih-fan to Enni and then to Chikotsu. Even though it is unclear if chinsō served as certificates of dharma transmission, throughout history they have been used to show a direct line of dharma transmission and lineage. The portraits of these three monks show a clear acknowledgment of enlightenment from one monk to his disciple, from Wuzun Shih-fan to Enni Ben’en to Chikotsu Dai’e. Although each monk may not have passed down their chinsō to his disciple as proof of transmission, we can undertsand the history of lineage as being shown through the passing down of the portraits.\n"}
{"id": "6938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6938", "title": "Classical order", "text": "Classical order\n\nAn order in architecture is a certain assemblage of parts subject to uniform established proportions, regulated by the office that each part has to perform.\nComing down to the present from Ancient Greek and Ancient Roman civilization, the architectural orders are the styles of classical architecture, each distinguished by its proportions and characteristic profiles and details, and most readily recognizable by the type of column employed. The three orders of architecture—the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian—originated in Greece. To these the Romans added, in practice if not in name, the Tuscan, which they made simpler than Doric, and the Composite, which was more ornamental than the Corinthian. The architectural order of a classical building is akin to the mode or key of classical music, the grammar or rhetoric of a written composition. It is established by certain \"modules\" like the intervals of music, and it raises certain expectations in an audience attuned to its language.\n\nWhereas the orders were essentially structural in Ancient Greek architecture, which made little use of the arch until its late period, in Roman architecture where the arch was often dominant, the orders became increasingly decorative elements except in porticos and similar uses. Columns shrank into half-columns emerging from walls or turned into pilasters. This treatment continued after the conscious and \"correct\" use of the orders, initially following exclusively Roman models, returned in the Italian Renaissance. Greek Revival architecture, inspired by increasing knowledge of Greek originals, returned to more authentic models, including ones from relatively early periods.\n\nEach style has distinctive capitals at the top of columns and horizontal entablatures which it supports, while the rest of the building does not in itself vary between the orders. The column shaft and base also varies with the order, and is sometimes articulated with vertical hollow grooves known as fluting. The shaft is wider at the bottom than at the top, because its entasis, beginning a third of the way up, imperceptibly makes the column slightly more slender at the top, although some Doric columns, especially early Greek ones, are visibly \"flared\", with straight profiles that narrow going up the shaft.\n\nThe capital rests on the shaft. It has a load-bearing function, which concentrates the weight of the entablature on the supportive column, but it primarily serves an aesthetic purpose. The necking is the continuation of the shaft, but is visually separated by one or many grooves. The echinus lies atop the necking. It is a circular block that bulges outwards towards the top to support the abacus, which is a square or shaped block that in turn supports the entablature. The entablature consists of three horizontal layers, all of which are visually separated from each other using moldings or bands. In Roman and post-Renaissance work, the entablature may be carried from column to column in the form of an arch that springs from the column that bears its weight, retaining its divisions and sculptural enrichment, if any. There are names for all the many parts of the orders.\n\nThe height of columns are calculated in terms of a ratio between the diameter of the shaft at its base and the height of the column. A Doric column can be described as seven diameters high, an Ionic column as eight diameters high and a Corinthian column nine diameters high, although the actual ratios used vary considerably in both ancient and revived examples, but keeping to the trend of increasing slimness between the orders. Sometimes this is phrased as \"lower diameters high\", to establish which part of the shaft has been measured.\n\nThere are three distinct orders in Ancient Greek architecture: Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. These three were adopted by the Romans, who modified their capitals. The Roman adoption of the Greek orders took place in the 1st century BC. The three Ancient Greek orders have since been consistently used in neo-classical European architecture.\n\nSometimes the Doric order is considered the earliest order, but there is no evidence to support this. Rather, the Doric and Ionic orders seem to have appeared at around the same time, the Ionic in eastern Greece and the Doric in the west and mainland.\n\nBoth the Doric and the Ionic order appear to have originated in wood. The Temple of Hera in Olympia is the oldest well-preserved temple of Doric architecture. It was built just after 600 BC. The Doric order later spread across Greece and into Sicily where it was the chief order for monumental architecture for 800 years. Early Greeks were no doubt aware of the use of stone columns with bases and capitals in Ancient Egyptian architecture, and that of other Near Eastern cultures, although there they were mostly used in interiors, rather than as a dominant feature of all or part of exteriors, in the Greek style. \n\nThe Doric order originated on the mainland and western Greece. It is the simplest of the orders, characterized by short, organized, heavy columns with plain, round capitals (tops) and no base. With a height that is only four to eight times its diameter, the columns are the most squat of all orders. The shaft of the Doric order is channeled with 16 flutes. The capital consists of a necking or Annulet which is a simple ring. The echinus is convex, or circular cushion like stone, and the abacus is square slab of stone.\n\nAbove the capital is a square abacus connecting the capital to the entablature. The Entablature is divided into three horizontal registers, the lower part of which is either smooth or divided by horizontal lines. The upper half is distinctive for the Doric order. The frieze of the Doric entablature is divided into triglyphs and metopes. A triglyph is a unit consisting of three vertical bands which are separated by grooves. Metopes are the plain or carved reliefs between two triglyphs.\n\nThe Greek forms of the Doric order come without an individual base. They instead are placed directly on the stylobate. Later forms, however, came with the conventional base consisting of a plinth and a torus. The Roman versions of the Doric order have smaller proportions. As a result, they appear lighter than the Greek orders.\n\nThe Ionic order came from eastern Greece, where its origins are entwined with the similar but little known Aeolic order. It is distinguished by slender, fluted pillars with a large base and two opposed \"volutes\" (also called \"scrolls\") in the echinus of the capital. The echinus itself is decorated with an egg-and-dart motif. The Ionic shaft comes with four more flutes than the Doric counterpart (totalling 24). The Ionic base has two convex moldings called \"tori\" which are separated by a scotia.\n\nThe Ionic order is also marked by an entasis, a curved tapering in the column shaft. A column of the ionic order is nine times its lower diameter. The shaft itself is eight diameters high. The architrave of the entablature commonly consists of three stepped bands (\"fasciae\"). The frieze comes without the Doric \"triglyph\" and \"metope\". The frieze sometimes comes with a continuous ornament such as carved figures instead.\n\nThe Corinthian order is the most ornate of the Greek orders, characterized by a slender fluted column having an ornate capital decorated with two rows of acanthus leaves and four scrolls. It is commonly regarded as the most elegant of the three orders. The shaft of the Corinthian order has 24 flutes. The column is commonly ten diameters high.\n\nThe Roman writer Vitruvius credited the invention of the Corinthian order to Callimachus, a Greek sculptor of the 5th century BC. The oldest known building built according to this order is the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates in Athens, constructed from 335 to 334 BC. The Corinthian order was raised to rank by the writings of Vitruvius in the 1st century BC.\n\nThe Romans adapted all the Greek orders and also developed two orders of their own, basically modifications of Greek orders. However, it was not until the Renaissance that these were named and formalized as the Tuscan and Composite, respectively the plainest and most ornate of the orders. The Romans also invented the superposed order. A superposed order is when successive stories of a building have different orders. The heaviest orders were at the bottom, whilst the lightest came at the top. This means that the Doric order was the order of the ground floor, the Ionic order was used for the middle story, while the Corinthian or the Composite order was used for the top story.\n\nThe Colossal order was invented by architects in the Renaissance. The Colossal order is characterized by columns that extend the height of two or more stories.\n\nThe Tuscan order has a very plain design, with a plain shaft, and a simple capital, base, and frieze. It is a simplified adaptation of the Doric order by the Greeks. The Tuscan order is characterized by an unfluted shaft and a capital that only consists of an echinus and an abacus. In proportions it is similar to the Doric order, but overall it is significantly plainer. The column is normally seven diameters high. Compared to the other orders, the Tuscan order looks the most solid.\n\nThe Composite order is a mixed order, combining the volutes of the Ionic with the leaves of the Corinthian order. Until the Renaissance it was not ranked as a separate order. Instead it was considered as a late Roman form of the Corinthian order. The column of the Composite order is typically ten diameters high.\n\nThe Renaissance period saw renewed interest in the literary sources of the ancient cultures of Greece and Rome, and the fertile development of a new architecture based on classical principles. The treatise \"De architectura\" by Roman theoretician, architect and engineer Vitruvius, is the only architectural writing that survived from Antiquity. Rediscovered in the 15th century, Vitruvius was instantly hailed as the authority on architecture. However, in his text the word \"order\" is not to be found. To describe the four species of columns (he only mentions: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic and Corinthian) he uses, in fact, various words such as: \"genus\" (gender), \"mos\" (habit, fashion, manner), \"opera\" (work).\n\nThe term \"order\", as well as the idea of redefining the \"canon\" started circulating in Rome, at the beginning of the 16th century, probably during the studies of Vitruvius' text conducted and shared by Peruzzi, Raphael and Sangallo.\nEver since, the definition of the \"canon\" has been a collective endeavor that involved several generations of European architects, from Renaissance and Baroque periods, basing their theories both on the study of Vitruvius' writings and the observation of Roman ruins (the Greek ruins became available only after Greek Independence, 1821–23). What was added were rules for the use of the Architectural Orders, and the exact proportions of them down to the most minute detail. Commentary on the appropriateness of the orders for temples devoted to particular deities (Vitruvius I.2.5) were elaborated by Renaissance theorists, with Doric characterized as bold and manly, Ionic as matronly, and Corinthian as maidenly.\n\nFollowing the examples of Vitruvius and the five books of the \"Regole generali di architettura sopra le cinque maniere de gli edifici\" by Sebastiano Serlio, published from 1537 onwards, Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola produced an architecture rule book that was not only more practical than the previous two treatises, but also was systematically and consistently adopting, for the first time, the term order to define each of the five different species of columns inherited from Antiquity. A first publication of the various plates, as separate sheets, appeared in Rome in 1562, with the title: \"Regola delli Cinque Ordini di Architettura\" (\"Canon of the Five Orders of Architecture \"). As David Watkin has pointed out, Vignola's book \"was to have an astonishing publishing history of over 500 editions in 400 years in ten languages, Italian, Dutch, English, Flemish, French, German, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, during which it became perhaps the most influential book of all times\".\nThe book consisted simply of an introduction followed by 32 annotated plates, highlighting the proportional system with all the minute details of the Five Architectural Orders. According to Christof Thoenes, the main expert of Renaissance architectural treatises, \"in accordance with Vitruvius’s example, Vignola chose a “module” equal to a half-diameter which is the base of the system. All the other measurements are expressed in fractions or in multiples of this module. The result is an arithmetical model, and with its help each order, harmoniously proportioned, can easily be adapted to any given height, of a façade or an interior. From this point of view, Vignola's Regola is a remarkable intellectual achievement\".\n\nIn America, \"The American Builder's Companion\", written in the early 19th century by the architect Asher Benjamin, influenced many builders in the eastern states, particularly those who developed what became known as the Federal style. The last American re-interpretation of Vignola's \"Regola\", was edited in 1904 by William Robert Ware.\n\nThe break from the classical mode came first with the Gothic revival, then the development of modernism during the 19th century. The Bauhaus promoted pure functionalism, stripped of superfluous ornament, and that has become one of the defining characteristics of modern architecture. There are some exceptions. Postmodernism introduced an ironic use of the orders as a cultural reference, divorced from the strict rules of composition. On the other hand, a few practitioners e.g. Quinlan Terry and Stuart Martin still work in a traditional classical idiom.\n\nSeveral orders, usually based upon the composite order and only varying in the design of the capitals, have been invented under the inspiration of specific occasions, but have not been used again. They are termed \"nonce orders\" by analogy to \"nonce words\"; several examples follow below. \nThese nonce orders all express the “speaking architecture” (\"architecture parlante\") that was taught in the Paris courses, most explicitly by Étienne-Louis Boullée, in which sculptural details of classical architecture could be enlisted to speak symbolically, the better to express the purpose of the structure and enrich its visual meaning with specific appropriateness. This idea was taken up strongly in the training of Beaux-Arts architecture, ca 1875–1915. \n\nRobert Adam's brother James was in Rome in 1762, drawing antiquities under the direction of Clérisseau; he invented a British Order and published an engraving of it. Its capital the heraldic lion and unicorn take the place of the Composite's volutes, a Byzantine or Romanesque conception, but expressed in terms of neoclassical realism. Adam's ink-and-wash rendering with red highlighting is at the Avery Library, Columbia University.\n\nIn 1789 George Dance invented an Ammonite Order, a variant of Ionic substituting volutes in the form of fossil ammonites for John Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery in Pall Mall, London. An adaptation of the Corinthian order by William Donthorne that used turnip leaves and mangelwurzel is termed the Agricultural order.\nIn the United States Benjamin Latrobe, the architect of the Capitol building in Washington DC, designed a series of botanically American orders. Most famous is the order substituting corncobs and their husks, which was executed by Giuseppe Franzoni and employed in the small domed Vestibule of the Supreme Court. Only the Supreme Court survived the fire of 24 August 1814, nearly intact. With peace restored, Latrobe designed an American order that substituted for the acanthus tobacco leaves, of which he sent a sketch to Thomas Jefferson in a letter, 5 November 1816. He was encouraged to send a model of it, which remains at Monticello. In the 1830s Alexander Jackson Davis admired it enough to make a drawing of it. In 1809 Latrobe invented a second American order, employing magnolia flowers constrained within the profile of classical mouldings, as his drawing demonstrates. It was intended for \"the Upper Columns in the Gallery of the Entrance of the Chamber of the Senate\" ().\nEdwin Lutyens, who from 1912 laid out New Delhi as the new seat of government for the British Empire in India, designed a Delhi Order having a capital displaying a band of vertical ridges, and with bells hanging at each corner as a replacement for volutes. His design for the new city's central palace, Viceroy's House, now the Presidential residence Rashtrapati Bhavan, was a thorough integration of elements of Indian architecture into a building of classical forms and proportions, and made use of the order throughout. The Delhi Order reappears in some later Lutyens buildings including Campion Hall, Oxford.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21131668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21131668", "title": "Costume coordination", "text": "Costume coordination\n\nCostume coordination is a method of dressing actors, employees or a person or group for theatrical productions and any venue requiring a fully realized character. It consists of pulling or renting existing stock clothing and costumes, altering them as needed to be used as stage clothes in a theatrical production, oversee their use, cleaning and eventual return to storage or rental company. Just as with costume design, the costume creates the over all appearance of the characters, but with the use of on hand items, including accessories. Sometimes coordinators may have a small budget to augment the existing stock or alter it for production needs.\n\nMany theatres with smaller budgets regularly reuse existing stock, especially older companies with large costume warehouses. It is also a staple of community theatre positions because it entails less time and effort and is the usual manner for schools to costume student performers from stored costumes donated or previously purchased.\n\nCoordination of costumes is also required at theme parks and festivals which require performers and dancers to have a consistent appearance, or maintained as originally designed.\n\nThere are costumes made for film and theater, but it is also made show off popular looks to fans and friends on the red carpet or other fancy places. \nDiscovered by INSIDER articles, celebrity women tend to dress or half dress for that manner, when they are not filming or doing production. These specific locations are places like, the Red Carpet, Engagement photos, Music Awards, VMA's, Venice Film Festival, and the Grammy's. This isn't a bashing statement, it is an honoring one. Celebrity women are constantly recognized for what they are wearing outside of the professional/ business atmosphere. These celebrity women are praised by their glam and style. They become more iconic for their stunning appearances at these elegant events. These outfits and designs are still in some way a costume because it's making up a certain character. As mentioned in Jorgensen book, famous designer Edith Head says, a celebrity wears different costumes to become someone different. The clothing chosen by designers for celebrities are the gifts of celebration, style and beauty.(Pantazi, Chloe 2017)\n\nThe fashion and costumes that are used in movies and theater actually have an effect on fashion shows and fans. These examples are seen on social media and common blogs. Some films are enjoyable by genres but others are memorable because of costumes. There are many specific designs and costumes that are used in production that valued and inspiring to most people today. Designers such as Keira Knightley and Audrey Hepburn have made many designs for films that are or have been in high fashion in reality. A few movies to think about and idealize are, Cinderella where there were much patients and dedication with the amounts of fabric used and the number of designers that worked on the dress. A few others, Mad Max Fury World, the designer received an Oscar for creating the costume for the character who Imperator Furiosa,; Atonement, where the green dress worn in the film was to illustrate jealousy and temptation. One other film would be Kill Bill, where the character The Bride played a strong roll and needed an even stronger costume to go with it. There are plenty of other movies and famous designers to read into along with different awards won for the costumes. (Fearn, Rebecca; 2016) Movie costumes can definitely become a trend in reality. For an example, the film where, Marilyn Monroe wore a white halterneck dress standing over a subway vent and how it became so popular because how beautiful it was or how correctly it was worn. It also left a message telling women \"how to really wear it.\" Costumes in film or stage have the ability to have some sort of an effect on fashion in society. To go through the list of top designs more, \"The Matrix\" where they wore trench coats and shades to build a serious character. \"Factory Girl\" being another film which shows exaggeration in the costumes for that time frame. One famous and popular film mentioned would be \"Cleopatra\", where the designer Renle made very creative and unique costumes. The designer didn't use accurate costumes to tell the story but what made the film interesting was the fun that the designers and directors put into it. (Clough, Rebecca 2014)\n\nThere are many famous designers that are left behind the scene and aren't always recognized for their work but some have significantly made it into the spotlight. Many designers began sewing when they are young and they would start off with small creations. Edith Head for an example is now as \"The Greastest Costume Designer\". In much news there are plenty of designers that have books written about them and their own websites of their designs. Edith Head had designed not only for herself but many other top celebrities like Grace Kelly. Sandy Powell is another known designer who talks about the particular work of a designer and the pressure. There are a lot of designs for a designer to complete and there isn't always enough time and sketches that need to be made for actors and directors preferences. In Head's words actors and actresses uses their fashion/costumes as a \"camouflage\" to indicate that they are a different person every time they are seen (Jorgensen 2010). Another designer is Kate Carin who does much work in South Africa. She has her own website that features her designs in films like, \"Saints and Strangers, Cape Town, The 51st State, Strongbow, The book of Negroes\" and the list goes on. This website talks about Carin's designs along with her relationships with directors; this is numerously stated in other research, mentioning the connection between the two. It also talks about her versatile style with being about to design costumes for commercials and also for period movies that takes research (Carin).\n\nThere is a lot of production and preparation used in a film so it's important to know how to read these costumes. There are popular costumes used in the 1300-1500s and also modern day costumes. These costumes discuss what certain costumes have and what does it mean. It also point out specific ways to educate oneself on the way costumes are used. There's a director of a costume organization named, Deborah Landis that who suggest helping students and teachers to appreciate costume designs more. The article digs in a little deeper, particularly focusing on media literacy and observation. It talks about the collaborations between costume designers, directors, and cinematographer. The article is similar to \"Role of Importance\" by differentiating between fashion and costume designers but this article has more depth. It begins with saying fashion designers have labels to sell their designs while costume designers have no label and they simply make characters. Again there's a lot of research costume designers done to make a perfect character; visiting places that are still standing, learning habits of the culture, collecting photos and so on. Costume designers use portraits to match their sketches. She continues after each section of telling what costume designer does along with providing assignments to teachers for students (Landis 2018).\n\nFor many people, costumes have importance. Costumes are made to make and invent a character in a film or play. Popular movies like \"Romeo and Juliet\" , \"Hamlet\" , and so on; are very collaborative movies that people constantly describe each significant style and fabric that a character is wearing throughout the film. These films are known for their heavy leather, lacquer red silk and all other things that were embedded into a costume, and other things made to represent those ages. There's a lot that goes into a costume according to this book, you have to select the fabric, cut out the costume, make sure it fits, and aging the costume which is making it look older by spraying it down with different things or painting over it. After the end of designing the costumes, it is then presented to the director for approval. Along with most costumes there are props to finish off a personality like knives, pistols, crowns, etc. depending on a character's role. These decisions are made by both the director and costume designer to give characters purposes in stories.(Motley 1965)\nThere's a book that highly discuss renaissance costumes called, \"Settings and Costumes of the Modern Stage\". This book doesn't just give information and photos about Costumes but also the stage and the setup to help with bringing characters to life. This information will be helpful because it gives costume designers their credit for their designs. The article discusses stage and costume connection, to help readers understand how costumes match the story/plot. This book has more pictures than words but it helps to create the understanding of a scene, story, and character. The book shows many photos and descriptions of plays like: Hamlet, Marriage, Resurrection, and so on. Authors, Simonson and Komisarjevsky also briefly mention the way New York Stage has made its changes in certain settings to a more glamorous fairy-tales (Simonson, Lee 1966). As mentioned above, there should be more appreciation for the work put into costumes. Even the simplest costumes that are in different genres affects a costume and tell a story. In science fiction it makes sense for directors and designers to dress up characters to create a fantasy and make it less compromising to relate. The film \"Tron Legacy\" where the colors of their costumes play big roles in the film and within the characters. These colors are specifically used to distinguish between the protagonist and antagonist. In \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\", costumes indicate the enemy characters in this film that are called the seven villains. The costumes used in \"Robin Hood\", was to connect to a certain time period of heroes of men that was formed in the medieval times. Costumes in films are used to enhance a reality of the narration not to define it. Simple outfits that are worn in film also tells some type of story or secret (Laverty, Lord Christopher 2011). Designers doesn't always enhance their characters by new fabric,costumes are rented from existing materials to fit characters in movies or plays. The use of colors and patterns in costumes are bold representations. Before a movie or play is produced, designers read scripts to identify the era in which the piece is taken place, this helps to get started on their first sketch.They create costume charts that label what characters are wearing in specific scenes. Their final sketch is presented after the first has been approved. The final sketch shows more vivid and unique features with the use of colors. All of this information sounds very similar to a fashion designer. Some people are unable to identify the difference between costume and fashion designers. Costume designing is made for characters in stories while fashion is for a person's style. Costume designs have limited time and assignments on creativity. There are more expenses used in costume designing and there is the need for research and knowledge of culture or history (UKEssay 2018).\n"}

As initially developed by W.R. Kunz and Horst Rittel, design rationale seeks to provide argumentation-based structure to the political, collaborative process of addressing wicked problems.\n\nA design rationale is the explicit listing of decisions made during a design process, and the reasons why those decisions were made. Its primary goal is to support designers by providing a means to record and communicate the argumentation and reasoning behind the design process. \nIt should therefore include:\n\nSeveral science areas are involved in the study of design rationales, such as computer science cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and knowledge management. For supporting design rationale, various frameworks have been proposed, such as QOC, DRCS, IBIS, and DRL.\n\nWhile argumentation formats can be traced back to Stephen Toulmin's work in the 1950s datums, claims, warrants, backings and rebuttals, the origin of design rationale can be traced back to W.R. Kunz and Horst Rittel's development of the Issue-Based Information System (IBIS) notation in 1970. Several variants on IBIS have since been proposed.\n\n\nThe first Rationale Management System (RMS) was PROTOCOL, which supported PHI, which was followed by other PHI-based systems MIKROPOLIS and PHIDIAS. The first system providing IBIS support was 's STIEC. Rittel developed a small system in 1983 (also not published) and the better known gIBIS (graphical IBIS) was developed in 1987.\n\nNot all successful DR approaches involve structured argumentation. For example, Carroll and Rosson's Scenario-Claims Analysis approach captures rationale in scenarios that describe how the system is used and how well the system features support the user goals. Carroll and Rosson's approach to design rationale is intended to help designers of computer software and hardware identify underlying design tradeoffs and make inferences about the impact of potential design interventions.\n\nThere are a number of ways to characterize DR approaches. Some key distinguishing features are how it is captured, how it is represented, and how it can be used.\n\n\"Rationale capture\" is the process of acquiring rationale information to a rationale management\n\n\nThe choice of design rationale representation is very important to make sure that the rationales we capture is what we desire and we can use efficiently. According to the degree of formality, the approaches that are used to represent design rationale can be divided into three main categories: informal, semiformal, or formal. In the informal representation, rationales can be recorded and captured by just using our traditionally accepted methods and media, such as word processors, audio and video records or even hand writings. However, these descriptions make it hard for automatic interpretation or other computer-based supports. In the formal representation, the rationale must be collected under a strict format so that the rationale can be interpreted and understood by computers. However, due to the strict format of rationale defined by formal representations, the contents can hardly be understood by human being and the process of capturing design rationale will require more efforts to finish, and therefore becomes more intrusive.\n\nSemiformal representations try to combine the advantages of informal and formal representations. On one hand, the information captured should be able to be processed by computers so that more computer based support can be provided. On the other hand, the procedure and method used to capture information of design rationale should not be very intrusive. In the system with a semiformal representation, the information expected is suggested and the users can capture rationale by following the instructions to either fill out the attributes according to some templates or just type into natural language descriptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign rationale has the potential to be used in many different ways. One set of uses, defined by Burge and Brown (1998), are:\n\nDR is used by research communities in software engineering, mechanical design, artificial intelligence, civil engineering, and human-computer interaction research. In software engineering, it could be used to support the designers ideas during requirement analysis, capturing and documenting design meetings and predicting possible issues due to new design approach. In software architecture and outcourcing solution design, it can justify the outcome of architectural decisions and serve as a design guide.\nIn civil engineering, it helps to coordinate the variety of work that the designers do at the same time in different areas of a construction project. It also help the designers to understand and respect each other's ideas and resolve any possible issues.\n\nThe DR can also be used by the project managers to maintain their project plan and the project status up to date. Also, the project team members who missed a design meeting can refer back the DR to learn what was discussed on a particular topic. The unresolved issues captured in DR could be used to organize further meetings on those topics.\nDesign rationale helps the designers to avoid the same mistakes made in the previous design. This can also be helpful to avoid duplication of work. In some cases DR could save time and money when a software system is upgraded from its previous versions.\n\nThere are several books and articles that provide excellent surveys of rationale approaches applied to HCI, Engineering Design and Software Engineering.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34732262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34732262", "title": "Detachment of wall paintings", "text": "Detachment of wall paintings\n\nThe detachment of wall paintings involves the removal of a wall painting from the structure of which it formed part. Once a common practice, with the move towards preservation \"in situ\", detachment is now largely restricted to cases where the only alternative is total loss. According to the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), \"detachment and transfer are dangerous, drastic and irreversible operations that severely affect the physical composition, material structure and aesthetic characteristics of wall paintings. These operations are, therefore, only justifiable in extreme cases when all options of in situ treatment are not viable.\"\n\nVitruvius records how in Sparta, in 59 BC, \"paintings have been taken out of certain walls by cutting through the bricks, enclosed in wooden frames, and brought to the Comitium\". A century later, apprised of paintings of Atalanta and Helen without drapery and \"enflamed with lust\", Caligula attempted to carry them off, but was prevented by the makeup of the plaster. Maiuri cites examples of wall paintings in wooden frames excavated at Pompeii, a precursor to what was to follow in the 18th and 19th centuries. The practice of detachment, in abeyance or undocumented for a millennium, was revived in Renaissance Italy, with several instances recorded by Vasari.\n\nIn their study, Mora, Mora, and Philippot cite four reasons for the \"over-use\" of detachment: the 19th-century division of the arts that privileged a \"painting\" divorced from its architectural and historical context; insensitivity to the aesthetic consequences, often partially concealed by restorers; the curiosity of art historians looking for \"sinopie\"; or perceived savings relating to the initial cost of treatment. Commercial gain and exploitation as consumer goods by collectors, dealers and restorers provides another possible incentive.\nThis process enables nowadays' companies to offer their customers an authentic fresco, created in their laboratory according to the ancient technique and transferred onto a canvas to be shipped to the place of installation.\n\nAs the values of a society change, so to does its attitude towards works of the past.\n\nThere are three main methods, typically referred to by their Italian terms, namely \"stacco a massello\", involving detachment and removal of painting, render, and some or all of the mural support; \"stacco\" or detachment of the painting with render alone; and \"strappo\", \"lit.\" \"tearing\", lifting of only the paint layer, attached to a facing with adhesive. In each case the resulting material must be applied to a new support.\n\nMinimum intervention and reversibility are core conservation ethics that favour preservation \"in situ\". Detachment breaks the intrinsic link between wall paintings and architecture; causes irreversible physical damage to the texture, topography, and tone of the painting; leaves a void in the stripped interior; with the introduction of new materials, typically leads to a cycle of retreatment; and has resulted in \"many transfers in terrible condition that serve as examples of serious, albeit unintentional, maltreatment\".\n\n"}

{"id": "47990869", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47990869", "title": "Diptych by Giovanni da Rimini", "text": "Diptych by Giovanni da Rimini\n\nAmong the paintings attributed to Giovanni da Rimini (\"fl\". 1292–1336) are two panels from a former diptych, dated to 1300–1305, of which the left wing is in the collection of the National Gallery, London, and the right that of the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Palazzo Barberini, Rome.\n\nGiovanni, \"pictor\" (painter), later \"maestro\" (master), is known from legal documents to have lived in Rimini between 1292 and 1336. This Giovanni is thought to be the same as the artist of the inscribed crucifix () in San Francesco (), Mercatello sul Metauro, inscribed IOH(ann)ES PICTOR FECIT HOC OPUS / FR(atri) TOBALDI, attesting to its creation by Giovanni the Painter, and dated 1309. Three or four other crucifixes are identified as being by the same artist, influenced by that () of Giotto: the \"Diotallevi” Crucifix (), in the Museo della città, Rimini (); another in San Lorenzo, Talamello; another in San Francesco, Sassoferrato; and a fourth sold at Sotheby's in 2015. Giovanni's panel paintings include what is probably half of a second diptych, \"The Virgin and Child with Five Saints\", in the Pinacoteca Comunale di Faenza (). Also attributed to Giovanni are wall paintings in the Campanile Chapel of Sant'Agostino, Rimini (), similarly showing Giotto's influence. Once confused with Giovanni Baronzio, Giovanni da Rimini's career and the beginnings of the fourteenth-century Riminese School have been reconstructed by scholars in recent decades, beginning with the 1935 exhibition \"La pittura riminese del Trecento\", organised by Cesare Brandi.\n\nThe diptych's left wing, once owned by the Barberini family, and subsequently by Pietro and Vincenzo Camuccini, was acquired as being by Giotto by Algernon Percy, 4th Duke of Northumberland in 1853, for £100. At Alnwick Castle thereafter, the painting passed by descent to the 12th Duke of Northumberland, before being sold at Sotheby's in 2014 for £5.7 million, including buyer's premium. A temporary export bar was placed on the painting, on the grounds of it meeting \"Waverley Criteria\" 2 and 3, being of \"outstanding aesthetic value\" and in excellent condition, and of \"outstanding significance for the study of Trecento painting in Rimini\". With the financial assistance of Ronald Lauder, son of Estée Lauder, the painting was acquired by the National Gallery in 2015, under an agreement that would see it loaned back to the benefactor for the remainder of his lifetime, with triennial displays at the Gallery, the first in 2017.\n\nThe \"jewel-like\" painting, showing the influence of Byzantine art and of Giotto, comprises four scenes in an unusual iconographic combination that likely reflects the donor's wishes. Of the four scenes, the top two are of a double height, the bottom two separated by the edge of the throne in place of a decorative band. They depict, from left to right, top to bottom, the Apotheosis of Saint Augustine, above a Gothic temple standing over the saint's empty tomb, the Coronation of the Virgin, above a crowd of onlooking saints and angels, Saint Catherine disputing with the philosophers before Emperor Maxentius, and a pairing of the episodes of Saint Francis receiving the stigmata and Saint John the Baptist in the wilderness, proclaiming the coming of the Messiah, with a winged cherub in-between. John the Baptist's scroll reads ECCE / AGN(us) / DEI / ECCE / Q(u)I TO(l) / LIT (peccata mundi) \"Behold the Lambe of God, which taketh away the sinne of the world\" (John 1.29, KJV).\n\nThe right wing of the diptych formed part of the Sciarra Collection until 1897 and is now in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Palazzo Barberini, Rome. Separated by decorative bands, the six zones of equal size depict, from left to right, top to bottom, the Nativity, with Christ's first bath in the foreground, the Crucifixion, the Entombment, the Descent into Limbo, the Resurrection, with the Three Marys at the Tomb, and the Last Judgment.\n\n\n"}

All classes of photography shall be included.\n\nIn 1940 a camera club was formed by a group of Gibraltarians who held their meetings at the now defunct Calpe Institute. This club was never firmly established and more often than not it was closed due to lack of support from both local photographers and those from the Services. The problem was very likely due to the fact that no photographer in Gibraltar had the experience of organising and running successfully a club of this nature.\n\nIn 1960, after having run for some months with a very small membership, the club closed, never to re-open. Its assets, about £30, were placed in a suspended account and held by the Committee of the Calpe Institute. Any hopes of re-forming the club were dashed by the closing of the Calpe Institute itself.\n\nDuring most of this time, the United Services Camera Club based at the Command Education Centre, ran successfully under various names, though with a small membership. The Club was not open to local civilians. This Club was closed in July 1964 by the Command Education Officer as a result of poor administration in the Club’s affairs, and re-opened in October 1964.\n\nIn October 1964, a Sergeant K Lloyd of the Middlesex Regiment and member of the United Services Camera Club, and local photographer Mr Albert Pizzarello put on an exhibition at the John Mackintosh Hall with a view of generating interest in the formation of a Service/civilian club. The venture proved successful and that same month a meeting was held at the John Mackintosh Hall with the aim of forming a camera club which would be open to everyone in Gibraltar, including servicemen and UK based civilians. The club was to be called The John Mackintosh Hall Camera Club, and would incorporate the United Services Camera Club. A caretaker Committee was formed and a provisional programme arranged.\n\nIn January 1965, the first Annual General Meeting took place and the following officers appointed :\n\nChairman :                                - Wing Commander P A Rumbold Scott, RAF\n\nSecretary & A/Chairman          - A A Hammon, Esq\n\nTreasurer & A/Secretary          - Staff Sergeant C P Berry, RAOC\n\nSyllabus Secretary                    - A J Pizzarello, Esq\n\nHouse Member                        - A Perera, Esq\n\nCommittee Members                - T Adamberry, Esq\n\n- M M Bonilla, Esq\n\n- Sgt K Lloyd was co-opted to the Committee.\n\nThe Chairman due to his appointment as Senior Air Staff Officer, RAF North Front, was frequently away from Gibraltar and so his duties were in the main carried out by Mr Hammon. As a result, S/Sgt Berry usually carried out the task of Secretary as well as that of Treasurer. Lectures, initial organisation and instruction were generally carried out by Messrs Berry and Pizzarello.\n\nLater that year the Committee decided to change the name of the Club to that of The Gibraltar Photographic Society. An application for affiliation to The Photographic Alliance of Great Britain was accepted. The aims of the Society were as follows :\n\n(a) To stimulate and promote amateur photographic activity within Gibraltar\n\n(b) To provide a congenial club atmosphere where enthusiasts can meet others similarly inclined.\n\n(c) To instruct, guide and assist novices in basic theoretical and practical photographic work\n\n(d) To cater for the intermediate and advanced amateur photographer by means of lectures, demonstrations, visual aids, instruction and discussion\n\n(e) To work in close liaison with the Photographic Alliance of Great Britain, to   promote the advancement of, and maintain a high standard of amateur photography in Gibraltar.\n\nSubscriptions were set at 5 shillings (25p) a month for full members and 2 shillings and 6 pence (12½p) for those under the age of 18. Meetings were held on Wednesdays at fortnightly intervals, with a short recess during the Summer. Several local professional photographers were elected to Honorary Membership, and Lady Lathbury, the Governor’s wife, accepted to become patroness of the Society.\n\nBy February 1966, the membership of the Society stood at around 40, with the average attendance at meetings between 20 and 25. Initially, novices were placed into groups with an intermediate or advanced worker nominated as group leader whose duty was to instruct the novices. Printing was carried out in the group leader’s own darkroom or at the John Mackintosh Hall. This system worked but with great difficulty, and was eventually abandoned. Competitions for black and white prints were held about once a month, and based on set themes. Entries were limited to 4 prints per person, and the print size restricted to 9 x 7 inches. It was not till 1974 that the first slides competition was held. This was just a one-off event. It was not till 1977 that regular slides competitions were incorporated into the annual programme, whilst the first colour prints competitions were not introduced till 1979. Initially, beginners had to compete in the same group as everybody else, but in 1973 they were provided with their own set of competitions.\n\nSince its founding, the Society has held an annual exhibition. At first this consisted of black and white prints, but in 1977 two other sections were added : a colour prints section and one for beginners. The addition of a slides section had to wait till 1986. The size and popularity of the exhibition grew to such an extent that since 1982 two exhibition rooms have been required for it. Problems with the judging of the annual exhibition resulted in the Society getting in touch with the Royal Photographic Society in 1982 with a view of their providing an adjudicator. This they did and have continued to do so up to the present, resulting in our forging very close links with this world-renowned organisation.\n\nIn 1968 the Society only had one challenge trophy in its possession : The Society Challenge Cup, which was presented to the winner of the competitions held during the year. By 1980 the total had increased to 11 as the number of competitions and the number of sections in the annual exhibition increased. In 1985, the late Alex Perera presented a trophy he had made himself for the award of the title of Photographer of the Year to the person obtaining the highest aggregate of points in competitions during the course of the year. Today the total number of challenge trophies is 20!\n\nThe logo of the Society was designed by Mr A Harper in 1977 and the proof drawing made by Mr A Ryman MBE. Also in that year the Society made its first application for funds from the Government Cultural Grants Committee and succeeded in obtaining the sum of £90. Thanks to subsequent grants from this Committee, the Society has been able to purchase much needed equipment, and more recently for the purchase of books to help establish a good reference library. Also in 1977 first contacts were made with the Malta Photographic Society. This was the first of many such contacts with other clubs and societies, especially from U.K., with the view of exchanging ideas and holding competitions. In 1986 the Society became members of the Southern Photographic Federation of Great Britain, and through them affiliated to the Photographic Alliance of  Great Britain. As members of the SPF the Society has competed every year in their league competitions. Contacts with Spanish clubs in La Linea and Algeciras were established in 1984, and a few competitions and exhibitions have been held with them since then.\n\nIn 1981 the Society held its first basic course on photography, aimed at members who were beginners, but also opened to the general public. These successful courses have been kept up to the present.\n\nIn 1976 a need was felt for updating and extending the statute of the Society. A new statute was voted in April of that year. Minor revisions were made in 1982 and in 1983  with respect to classes of membership, and again in 1984 with respect to the use of the darkroom and equipment. In 1990 further changes were made with respect to the use of the Society’s equipment and premises, and lastly in 1994 with respect of classes of membership once again.\n\nThe 150th anniversary of the invention of photography was marked in1989 by the Society holding a special exhibition. For this exhibition copy prints of early historical photographs were purchased from the RPS, and exhibited together with hundreds of old and personal photographs loaned by members of the public, depicting family photos and old views of Gibraltar. The exhibition was a great success.\n\nFirst enquiries on the acquisition of premises were made in 1985, and at the end of that year, during the opening of a special exhibition marking the 20th anniversary of the Society, the then Minister for Education Mr G Mascarenhas announced that we were being offered premises at Wellington Front.  These premises were officially handed over in January 1986, and works on refurbishing them commenced in April. By March 1987 the bulk of the works were over in the main hall, and the first Annual General Meeting held there that month. Works still continued in refurbishing the rest of the premises, and in fitting out a darkroom. The darkroom at John Mackintosh Hall was demolished in December 1989, and it was not till August 1990 that the one at Wellington Front became operational. The official opening of the premises was held on 26 November 1990, and carried out by H.E. the Governor Sir Derek Reffell. This coincided with the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Society. The acquisition of  the premises resulted in the Society being able to extend its activities without restrictions, and in the acquisition of the type of equipment which would have been impossible to obtain otherwise.\n\nAt present the Society is self-sufficient in terms of darkroom, audio-visual and studio facilities. The Society has also embraced the advent of digital imaging without any reservations; in all competitions digitally processed and manipulated images are accepted on a par with traditionally processed ones. With the help of awards from the Government Cultural Grants Committee, the Society has purchased three computers, two printers, two slides/negative scanner, a flat-bed scanner and a digital projector. In the programme of events for the year, a significant amount of time is dedicated to learning how to use imaging programmes, and the hardware.\n\nThe Society has premises which will shortly be refurbished in Summer 2015 at Wellington Front, their mailing address :\n\nWellington Front, PO Box 1422, Gibraltar.\n\nThe society hold a yearly exhibition, dates of the exhibition can be obtained from the society´s website \n\nThe society holds a series of competitions throughout the year in two categories, Beginners and Advance with the photographer who has mosts points at the end of the year is presented with a trophy as \"Beginner of the Year\" and \"Photographer of the Year\"\n\nAny person who has an interest in photography can become a member of the society for a very small fee. More information about becoming a member can be obtained from the Society´s Secretary.\n\n"}

As one of the earliest interdisciplinary arts programs in the United States, it has been an incubator for new approaches towards art making that has shaped the development of arts professionals for over thirty-three years. Guided by the principle that interdisciplinarity \"is a defining characteristic of contemporary art practice\" and \"a necessary prerequisite for those artists who will shape the future of creative practice\", the artists who work in the Interdisciplinary Arts department investigate new terrain.\n\nExamining concepts, forms and techniques from across the fine, performing and media arts, students work with a diverse array of unique and experimental approaches that interrogate artist books, installations, gesture and movement, sound art, durational performance, interactive media, video, performance media, papermaking, letterpress, etching and offset printing, electronically controlled artworks, online artwork, performance in artificial spaces, democratic multiples, written, spoken and performed text, dramatic forms, DIY/DIT collaborative strategies and relational art forms.\n\nInterdisciplinary Arts was formulated in Chicago Il, 1976, by Suzanne Cohan-Lange, Jean Unsworth, and Rebecca Ruben. Originally accepted by the Chicago Consortium of Colleges as a program taught across several universities, in 1981, it was established as a department with a permanent home at Columbia College Chicago. At that time, the Interdisciplinary Arts MA program was formalized within the context of the department. Since then, two MFA degrees were added: the Interdisciplinary Book & Paper Arts MFA, launched in 1994; and the Interdisciplinary Arts & Media MFA, launched in 2002. The founding of the Interdisciplinary Arts program is preceded by the undergraduate program in the Studio for Interrelated Media program founded by Harris Barron in 1969 at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design in Boston.\n\nThe Interdisciplinary Arts MA is for art teachers who want to expand their repertoire of techniques, as well as assist practicing artists in expanding their practice to include new media. It is immersed in the five traditional art media that make up the heart of the program: visual art, movement, sound, writing, and drama.\n\nThe Interdisciplinary Book & Paper Arts MFA program enables students to participate in the contemporary art world by encouraging them to consider book and paper as a site for interdisciplinary practice. It promotes the understanding of hand papermaking and the book arts as artistic media with applications in cultural discourse, community building, and collaborative practice.\n\nThe Interdisciplinary Arts & Media MFA fosters an innovative dialog between the fine, performing and media arts. It is a graduate program for traditional and performing artists who want to incorporate media into their artistic practice and for media artists who want to expand into areas such as performance, installation, interactive, and relational art forms.\n\nIn the 916 S. Wabash building are housed the departmental offices, faculty offices, conference room, lecture hall, two smart classrooms, large computer lab, three installation labs and the media equipment center. Additionally, the Center for Book and Paper Arts is part of the Interdisciplinary Arts department. The Center for Book and Paper Arts occupies the entire second floor of the historic Ludington Building at 1104 South Wabash and includes a papermaking studio, a letterpress facility, a bookbindery, a gallery, a smart classroom, a multi-purpose space for performance and lectures, a computer laboratory, a critique room, studio space for artists, a resource room, and offices for the staff. Also at 1104 South Wabash are studio spaces for the MFA students.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "201482", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=201482", "title": "Mary Quant", "text": "Mary Quant\n\nDame Barbara Mary Quant, Mrs Plunket Greene, DBE, FCSD, RDI (born 11 February 1934) is an English fashion designer and fashion icon, who is of Welsh heritage.\n\nShe became an instrumental figure in the 1960s London-based Mod and youth fashion movements. She was one of the designers who took credit for the miniskirt and hotpants, and by promoting these and other fun fashions she encouraged young people to dress to please themselves and to treat fashion as a game. Ernestine Carter, an authoritative and influential fashion journalist of the 1950s and 1960s, wrote: \"It is given to a fortunate few to be born at the right time, in the right place, with the right talents. In recent fashion there are three: Chanel, Dior, and Mary Quant.\"\n\nQuant was born on 11 February 1934 in Blackheath, London, the daughter of Welsh teachers. Her parents, Jack and Mildred Quant (John H Quant married Mildred G Jones, 1925), were both from mining families; however, they had been awarded scholarships to grammar school and had both attained first-class degrees at Cardiff University before they moved to London to work as school teachers.\n\nShe went to Blackheath High School, then studied illustration at Goldsmiths College. After gaining a Diploma in Art Education from Goldsmiths, Quant began an apprenticeship at Erik, a high-end Mayfair milliner on Brook Street next door to Claridge's hotel.\n\nHer younger brother John Antony 'Tony' Quant became a high ranking Dental Officer in the Royal Air Force.\n\nShe met her future husband and business partner, Alexander Plunket Greene in 1953. They were married from 1957 until his death in 1990, and had a son, Orlando (b. 1970).\n\nIn November 1955, Quant and Plunket Greene teamed up with a photographer and former solicitor, Archie McNair, to open Quant's first shop on the corner of Markham Square and King's Road in Chelsea, London called \"Bazaar\", above \"Alexander's\", a basement restaurant run by Plunket Green. In 1957, they opened the second branch of \"Bazaar\", which was designed by Terence Conran.\n\nSuccessful designs from this early period included small white plastic collars to brighten up sweaters and dresses, bright stockings in colours matched to her knitwear, men's cardigans made long enough to be worn as dresses, and a pair of \"mad\" lounging pyjamas made by Quant herself which were featured in \"Harper's Bazaar\" and purchased by an American manufacturer to copy. Following this, Quant decided to design and make more of the clothes she stocked, instead of buying-in stock. Initially working solo, she was soon employing a handful of machinists, and by 1966 she was working with eighteen manufacturers concurrently.\n\nFor a while in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Quant was one of only two London-based high-end designers consistently offering youthful clothes for young people. The other was Kiki Byrne, who opened her boutique on the King's Road in direct competition with Quant.\n\nThe miniskirt, described as one of the defining fashions of the 1960s, is one of the garments most widely associated with Quant. While she is often cited as the inventor of the style, this claim has been challenged by others. Marit Allen, a contemporary fashion journalist and editor of the influential \"Young Ideas\" pages for UK \"Vogue\", firmly stated that another British fashion designer, John Bates, rather than Quant or André Courrèges, was the original creator of the miniskirt. Others credit Courrèges with the invention of the style. However, skirts had been getting shorter since the 1950s—a development Quant considered practical and liberating, allowing women the ability to run for a bus.\n\nQuant later said, \"It was the girls on the King's Road [during the \"Swinging London\" scene] who invented the mini. I was making easy, youthful, simple clothes, in which you could move, in which you could run and jump and we would make them the length the customer wanted. I wore them very short and the customers would say, 'Shorter, shorter.'\" She gave the miniskirt its name, after her favourite make of car, the Mini, and said of its wearers, \"they are curiously feminine, but their femininity lies in their attitude rather than in their appearance ... She enjoys being noticed, but wittily. She is lively—positive—opinionated.\"\n\nIn addition to the miniskirt, Quant is often credited with inventing the coloured and patterned tights that tended to accompany the garment, although their creation is also attributed to the Spanish couturier Cristóbal Balenciaga who offered harlequin-patterned tights in 1962 or to John Bates.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Quant popularised hot pants and became a British fashion icon. Through the 1970s and 1980s she concentrated on household goods and make-up, rather than just her clothing lines, including the duvet which she claims to have invented.\n\nIn 1988, Quant designed the interior of the Mini (1000) Designer (originally dubbed the Mini Quant, the name was changed when popularity charts were set against having Quant's name on the car). It featured black and white striped seats with red trimming. The seatbelts were red, and the driving and passenger seats had Quant's signature on the upper left quadrant. The steering wheel had Quant's signature daisy and the bonnet badge had \"Mary Quant\" written over the signature name. The headlight housings, wheel arches, door handles and bumpers were all nimbus grey, rather than the more common chrome or black finishes. Two thousand were released in the U.K. on 15 June 1988, and a number were also released on to foreign markets; however, the numbers for these are hard to come by. The special edition Mini came in two body colours, jet black and diamond white. She is a Fellow of the Chartered Society of Designers, and winner of the \"Minerva Medal\", the Society's highest award.\n\nIn 2000, she resigned as director of \"Mary Quant Ltd.\", her cosmetics company, after a Japanese buy-out. There are more than 200 Mary Quant Colour shops in Japan.\n\nIn 1963 Quant was the first winner of the Dress of the Year award. In 1966 she was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for her outstanding contribution to the fashion industry. She arrived at Buckingham Palace to accept the award in a cream wool jersey minidress with blue facings. She was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2015 New Year Honours for services to British fashion.\n\nIn 1990 she won the Hall of Fame Award of the British Fashion Council. Quant received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 2006. In 2012, Quant was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork – the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" album cover – to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life.\n\n\nIn the 1966 Donovan song - 'Sunny South Kensington', Quant and Jean-Paul Belmondo's drug use/abuse is immortalized in the lyric: \"Jean-Paul Belmondo and-a Mary Quant got stoned, to say the least\".\n\n\n\n"}

NMWA was incorporated in 1981 by Wallace and Wilhelmina Holladay. Since opening its doors in 1987, the museum has acquired a collection of more than 4,500 paintings, sculptures, works on paper, and decorative art. Highlights of the collection include works by Mary Cassatt, Frida Kahlo, and Élisabeth Louise Vigée-Le Brun. The museum occupies the old Masonic Temple, a building listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe museum was founded to reform traditional histories of art. It is dedicated to discovering and making known women artists who have been overlooked or unacknowledged, and assuring the place of women in contemporary art. The museum's founder, Wilhelmina Cole Holladay, and her husband Wallace F. Holladay began collecting art in the 1960s, just as scholars were beginning to discuss the under-representation of women in museum collections and major art exhibitions. Impressed by a 17th-century Flemish still life painting by Clara Peeters that they saw in Europe, they sought out information on Peeters and found that the definitive art history texts referenced neither her nor any other woman artist. They became committed to collecting artwork by women and eventually to creating a museum and research center.\n\nThe National Museum of Women in the Arts was incorporated in December 1981 as a private, non-profit museum, and the Holladay donation became the core of the institution's permanent collection. After purchasing and extensively renovating a former Masonic Temple, NMWA opened in April 1987 with the inaugural exhibition American Women Artists, 1830–1930. To underscore its commitment to increasing the attention given to women in all disciplines, NMWA commissioned Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Ellen Taaffe Zwilich to write \"Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra\" inspired by five paintings from the permanent collection, for an opening concert. In November 1997, the Elisabeth A. Kasser Wing was opened, adding two new galleries, a larger museum shop, and a reception room. Currently, Director Susan Fisher Sterling heads a staff of more than 30 people.\n\nIn 1983, NMWA purchased a landmark former Masonic temple in the Renaissance Revival style to house its works. After extensive renovations that included the addition of the two dramatic marble stairways linking the first floor and mezzanine, the museum opened to the public on April 7, 1987. The Elizabeth A. Kasser Wing opened November 8, 1997 making the entire facility .\n\nWilhelmina Cole Holladay is the founder and chair of the Board of the National Museum of Women in the Arts. Since her discovery that women artists have historically been omitted from collegiate art history texts, Wilhelmina Cole Holladay has made it her mission to bring to the forefront the accomplishments of women through collecting, exhibiting and researching women artists of all nationalities and time periods.\n\nHolladay created individual committees of over 1,000 volunteers from 27 states and 7 countries, to give educational opportunities to children through collaborations with schools and other community groups (e.g. Girl Scouts of the USA), as well as provided opportunities for adults to participate and encourage art in local communities across the globe.\n\nWilhelmina Cole Holladay's interest in art was sparked as a student at Elmira College in New York, where she studied art history, followed by graduate work at the University of Paris.

The museums efforts are in part to bring \"character\" to an area where \"there is a lot of good stuff going on,\" due to revitalization programs in the neighborhood.\n\nNiki de Saint Phalle's works, four in total, were the first in a series of installations. The museums installation of de Saint Phalle's iconic pop art works are meant to be contrasting to the traditional sculpture that graces the streets and squares of Washington. All five major median strips will eventually be made into \"sculpture islands,\" as described by National Museum of Women in the Art's director Susan Fisher Sterling. Another inspiration for the project comes from the lack of innovative contemporary art in Washington, encouraging the evolution of an area that is in need of becoming hip and vibrant. The second artist to be featured, whose works are on display March 8, 2012 – March 9, 2014, was Chakaia Booker.\n\nThe project has been sponsored by Medda Gudelsky, the D.C. Downtown B.I.D., the Philip L. Graham Fund, the Homer and Martha Gudelsky Family Foundation, members of the museum, the D.C. Department of Transportation, among others.\n\nThese works will remain up for one year, before being returned to the artists foundation.\n\nThe collection currently contains more than 4,500 works in a variety of styles and media, spanning from the 16th century to present day. Among the earliest works is Lavinia Fontana’s Portrait of a Noblewoman, ca. 1580. There are also a number of special collections, including 18th century botanical prints, works by British and Irish women silversmiths from the 17th–19th centuries, and more than 1,000 unique and limited edition artists’ books.\n\nNearly 1,000 artists are represented, including Magdalena Abakanowicz, Lynda Benglis, Rosa Bonheur, Chakaia Booker, Louise Bourgeois, Lola Alvarez Bravo, Rosalba Carriera, Mary Cassatt, Elizabeth Catlett, Judy Chicago, Camille Claudel, Louisa Courtauld, Petah Coyne, Louise Dahl-Wolfe, Elaine de Kooning, Lesley Dill, Helen Frankenthaler, Sonia Gechtoff, Marguerite Gérard, Nan Goldin, Nancy Graves, Grace Hartigan, Frida Kahlo, Angelica Kauffman, Käthe Kollwitz, Lee Krasner, Justine Kurland, Bettye Lane, Marie Laurencin, Hung Liu, Judith Leyster, Maria Martinez, Maria Sibylla Merian, Joan Mitchell, Gabriele Münter, Elizabeth Murray, Alice Neel, Louise Nevelson, Sarah Miriam Peale, Clara Peeters, Lilla Cabot Perry, Jaune Quick-to-See Smith, Rachel Ruysch, Elisabetta Sirani, Joan Snyder, Lilly Martin Spencer, Alma Thomas, Suzanne Valadon, and Élisabeth-Louise Vigée-Le Brun.\n\nThe Betty Boyd Dettre Library and Research Center (LRC) provides researchers with information about women visual artists from all time periods and nationalities. It is open to scholars, students, researchers, curators, museum professionals, and the general public. The LRC collection includes 18,500 volumes of books and exhibition catalogues, 50 periodical titles, and research files on 18,000 individual women artists. These files include resumes, correspondence, reproductions, articles, and other ephemeral materials. The Arts and Entertainment Network Media Library holds approximately 500 videos, DVDs, audio tapes, and other audiovisual materials, including examples of video art, interviews with women artists, documentaries, and films directed by women.\n\nAlso available to researchers are The Nelleke Nix and Marianne Huber Collection: The Frida Kahlo Papers consists of more than 360 unpublished letters, postcards, notes, clippings, printed matter, and drawings relating to the artist's life and work.\n\nIn spring 2007, the LRC launched \"Clara: Database of Women Artists,\" a user-friendly searchable interface for biographic information on close to 18,000 historic and contemporary women artists from around the world. Since integrated within the NMWA web site, Clara has been decommissioned and is in the process of being moved.\n\nBeginning in 1987 with \"American Women Artists, 1830–1930\", NMWA has presented more than 200 exhibitions. A selection of the most prominent exhibitions includes:\n\n\nNMWA hosts educational programs for all age groups to teach the public about the artistic accomplishments of women. Programs include monthly Community Days with free museum admission, and Role Model Workshops that connect teenagers with accomplished women working in the art world. Member days include curator- and artist-led tours. The Education Department is also involved in various outreach programs to area educators. For example, the 2010 \"Teachers Connect\" program was designed around the promotion of NMWA's Art, Books, and Creativity curriculum.\n\nThe free Shenson Chamber Music Concerts support the museum's mission of recognizing women in all areas of the arts by featuring woman musicians throughout the year. Past performers include the Ahn Trio, Arianna and Eugenia Zuckerman, Ingrid Fliter, Sharon Ibsin and Rachel Barton Pine. NMWA's literary programs showcase women writers by bringing in authors such as Susan Vreeland, Lisa See, Maxine Hong Kingston, Naomi Shihab Nye, Joyce Carol Oates, and Mireille Guiliano. In addition, NMWA has offered film screenings of works by respected women directors and screenwriters including Maya Angelou, Barbara Hammer, Cheryl Dunye, Eva López Sánchez, Miranda July, Bette Gordon, and Julie Taymor.\n\nThe museum is located at 1250 New York Avenue and H Street N.W. The closest Washington Metro stations are Metro Center or McPherson Square stations. The museum is open Monday–Saturday 10 a.m.–5 p.m. and Sundays noon–5 p.m. Admission is $10 for adults, $8 for students and visitors 65 and over, and free for members and visitors 18 and under. Admission is free to all on the first Sunday of every month. The NMWA Museum Shop is open the same hours at the Museum.\n\n\n"}

He tries to destroy the olifant along with his sword Durendal, lest they fall into enemy hands. In the end, Roland blows the horn, but the force required bursts his temple, resulting in death. The \"Karlamagnussaga\" elaborates (V. c.XIV) that Roland's olifant was a unicorn's horn, hunted in India.\n\nAnother famous olifant belonged to Gaston IV, viscount of Béarn, and is now preserved in the Spanish city of Saragosse, which he helped conquer from the Banu Hud.\n\nThe \"Horn\" or \"Oliphant of Ulph\", preserved in the treasury of York Minster is one of a group that were carved in Salerno in the first half of the eleventh century.

In order to keep their characters current, comic book companies, as well as cartoon companies, game companies, children's show companies, and toy companies, frequently rewrite the origins of their oldest characters. This goes from adding details that do not contradict earlier facts to a totally new origin which makes it seem that it is an altogether different character.\n\nA pourquoi story, also dubbed an \"origin story\", is also used in mythology, referring to narratives of how a world began, how creatures and plants came into existence, and why certain things in the cosmos have certain yet distinct qualities.\n\nIn \"The Superhero Reader\" (nominated for a 2014 Eisner Award for Best Scholarly/Academic Work), edited by Charles Hatfield (Professor at University of Connecticut), Jeet Heer (Toronto-based journalist), and Dr. Kent Worcester (Professor of Political Science at Marymount Manhattan College), the editors write in \"Section One: Historical Considerations\": \"Almost all superheroes have an origin story: a bedrock account of the transformative events that set the protagonist apart from ordinary humanity. If not a prerequisite for the superhero genre, the origin... is certainly a prominent and popular trope that recurs so frequently as to offer clues to the nature of this narrative tradition. To read stories about destroyed worlds, murdered parents, genetic mutations, and mysterious power-giving wizards is to realize the degree to which the superhero genre is about transformation, about identity, about difference, and about the tension between psychological rigidity and a flexible and fluid sense of human nature. ... When surveying the superhero genre, preliminary questions often turn to the problem of roots.\" The book has a wealth of pertinent bibliographies.\n\nEnglish professors Dr. Alex Romagnoli and Dr. Gian S. Pagnucci, of Indiana University of Pennsylvania, discuss in their book \"Enter the Superheroes: American Values, Culture, and the Canon of Superhero Literature\" \"the nature of superhero origin stories and how the writing of these origin stories helps make superhero narratives a unique literary genre.\" For example, they write, \"Superheroes get very complicated when it comes to their histories, but one part of their stories remains forever constant and important. Even more than 'death' stories, crossovers, event stories, and attire changes, origin stories are the core of superheroes' existences. Origins not only reflect the sociohistorical contexts in which heroes were created, but they also reflect a culture's understanding of what makes superheroes storytelling unique vehicles.\" Thereafter, Romagnoli and Pagnucci go on to explain why the origin story is as important to the audience as to the generations of writers who continue heroic tales.\n\nDr. Randy Duncan (comics scholar and professor of communication, Henderson State University, Arkadelphia, Arkansas) and Dr. Matthew J. Smith (Department of Communication, Wittenberg University, Springfield, Ohio) use the origin story of Spider-Man as an example of how a character can be created by the persistence of a writer who has definite preferences in creating a character's personality, even if the publisher resists. \"It is difficult to discern which is more often told: Spider-Man's origin or the tales told around that origin. All reveal fascinating aspects of a teenage loner fatefully 'bitten by a radioactive spider' to find himself with 'the proportionate strength and agility of an arachnid'.\" Duncan and Smith explain how Stan Lee butted heads with publisher Martin Goodman, who worried about an \"ick factor,\" but Lee prevailed. \"The entire Spider-Man concept resonates with the primary attributes of many genres and traditions,\" the authors say. \"Like a heady puree of [Mary] Shelley's \"Frankenstein\", Bob Kane's Batman, and Franz Kafka's \"Metamorphosis\", Spider-Man's origin invokes gothic and crime fiction motifs like the ostracized genius, doomed loved ones, the misuse or misfiring of science, the gritty noir city, the driven vigilante, and the fateful 'return of the repressed'.\" The authors proceed to investigate these various issues of the origin story.\n\nHeroes\nVillains\n\n\n"}

An oil painting on canvas measuring 147 x 199 cm, it is owned by the Louvre. Ingres subsequently painted several variants of the composition.\n\n\"Orlando Furioso\", a 16th-century epic poem by Ariosto, is the source of the tale of Roger, a knight whose steed is a hippogriff (a legendary creature half horse and half eagle). While riding near Brittany's coast Roger espies a beautiful woman, Angelica, chained to a rock on the Isle of Tears. She has been abducted and stripped naked by barbarians who have left her there as a human sacrifice to a sea monster. As Roger rides to her aid, a great thrashing in the water occurs—it is the monster approaching Angelica. Roger drives his lance between the monster's eyes and rescues Angelica.\n\nIngres received the commission for the work in 1817 and completed it in 1819. When it was exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1819 alongside his \"Grande Odalisque\", the work was criticised for the treatment of Angelica's figure, described by the art historian Théophile Silvestre as \"Angelica with goitres\" and by the painter Henry de Waroquier as \"triple-breasted Angelica\". Comte de Blacas, the French ambassador to the Vatican, acquired the painting for King Louis XVIII. It was installed above a doorway in the throne room of Versailles from 1820 until 1823 before being relocated to the Musée du Luxembourg. It was Ingres' first painting to enter a public collection.\n\nIngres executed the work with his usual care, and many preparatory drawings for the composition and the individual figures exist. \n\nHe painted several later versions of the composition, none of which are known to have been commissioned. A reduced copy of the painting in a vertical format was painted sometime before 1839, and eventually acquired by Edgar Degas, who purchased it in 1894. It was later acquired by the National Gallery, London. An 1841 replica, in an oval format, is in the Musée Ingres. A painting of 1859, also in an oval format, repeats the figure of Angelica but nearly eliminates Roger, whose presence is indicated only by his shield visible at the right edge. In 1825–30 Ingres painted \"Perseus and Andromeda\" (Detroit Institute of Arts), which like \"Roger Freeing Angelica\" features a nude woman chained to a rock and a hero slaying a sea monster.\n\n\n\n"}

As an expression of sexuality, it refers to sexual pleasure derived from looking at erotic objects: erotic photographs, pornography, naked bodies, etc.\n\nThe term was introduced to translate Freud's , or pleasure in looking. Freud considered pleasure in looking to be a regular partial instinct in childhood, which might be sublimated into interest in art, or alternatively become fixated into what the Rat Man called \"a burning and tormenting curiosity to see the female body\".\n\nFreud thought that inhibition of scopophilia might lead to actual disturbances of vision; other analysts have suggested that it might lead to a retreat from concrete objects into a world of abstractions.\n\nScopophilia was developed in the psychoanalytic theorizing of Otto Fenichel, with special reference to identification. Fenichel maintained that \"a child who is looking for libidinous purposes...wants to look at an object in order to 'feel along with him'\". He also explored how looking could substitute for acting in those anxious to avoid guilt.\n\nJacques Lacan subsequently drew on Sartre's theory of the gaze to link scopophilia with the apprehension of the other: \"the gaze is this object lost and suddenly refound in the conflagration of shame, by the introduction of the other\". Lacan privileged scopophilia in his theory of how desire is captured by the imaginary image of the other; other French analysts have emphasised how the discovery of sexual difference in childhood, and the accompanying sense of not knowing subsequently fuels the scopophilic drive.\n\nVoyeurism plays a role in the films of Alfred Hitchcock, most notably in the 1960 film, \"Psycho\". In the film, Norman Bates is revealed to have a peephole to one of the hotel rooms. He uses this to spy on Marion Crane, while she is in a state of undress.\n\nScopophilia is mentioned by name in director Michael Powell's \"Peeping Tom\" (1960). The entire film is an exercise in voyeurism. Powell, and his screenwriter, Leo Marks, created to prove to what extent how one is capable of watching things one shouldn't watch. At the same time, Powell created a psychological essay about what makes Mark Lewis, the central character of the film, act the way he acted. Mark has been scarred for life thanks to what his own father did to him during a period of his growing years that formed his character into the reclusive man who feels at home doing the despicable crimes he commits. (I.M.D.B.)\n\nBuilding on Lacan's work, scopophilia was used by cinema psychoanalysts of the 1970s to describe pleasures (often considered pathological) and other unconscious processes occurring in spectators when they watch films. Voyeurism and the male gaze have been seen as central elements in such mainstream cinematic viewing, and are most famously discussed in Laura Mulvey's influential 1975 essay \"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema\".\n\nOthers, however, have objected to the element of scapegoating in such an analysis of the variegated pleasures of movie-viewing.\n\nCritical race theorists, such as bell hooks, David Marriott, and Shannon Winnubst, have also taken up scopophilia and the scopic drive as a mechanism to describe racial \"other-ing\" (c.f. scopophobia).\n\nIn their theories scopophilia is a question of fixing the appearance and identity of the other through the gaze. So cultural scopophilia restricts the visible representations of racial identity that it allows.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11954761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11954761", "title": "Shakespeare's writing style", "text": "Shakespeare's writing style\n\nWilliam Shakespeare's style of writing was borrowed from the conventions of the day and adapted to his needs.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare's first plays were written in the conventional style of the day. He wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from the needs of the characters or the drama. The poetry depends on extended, sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits, and the language is often rhetorical—written for actors to declaim rather than speak. For example, the grand speeches in \"Titus Andronicus\", in the view of some critics, often hold up the action, and the verse in \"The\" \"Two Gentlemen of Verona\" has been described as stilted.\n\nSoon, however, William Shakespeare began to adapt the traditional styles to his own purposes. The opening soliloquy of \"Richard III\" has its roots in the self-declaration of Vice in medieval drama. At the same time, Richard's vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare's mature plays. No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with \"Romeo and Juliet\" perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles. By the time of \"Romeo and Juliet\", \"Richard II\", and \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" in the mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry. He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself.\n\nShakespeare's standard poetic form was blank verse, composed in iambic pentameter with clever use of puns and imagery. In practice, this meant that his verse was usually unrhymed and consisted of ten syllables to a line, spoken with a stress on every second syllable. The blank verse of his early plays is quite different from that of his later ones. It is often beautiful, but its sentences tend to start, pause, and finish at the end of lines, with the risk of monotony. Once Shakespeare mastered traditional blank verse, he began to interrupt and vary its flow. This technique releases the new power and flexibility of the poetry in plays such as \"Julius Caesar\" and \"Hamlet\". Shakespeare uses it, for example, to convey the turmoil in Hamlet's mind:\n\nAfter \"Hamlet\", Shakespeare varied his poetic style further, particularly in the more emotional passages of the late tragedies. The literary critic A. C. Bradley described this style as \"more concentrated, rapid, varied, and, in construction, less regular, not seldom twisted or elliptical\". In the last phase of his career, Shakespeare adopted many techniques to achieve these effects. These included run-on lines, irregular pauses and stops, and extreme variations in sentence structure and length. In \"Macbeth\", for example, the language darts from one unrelated metaphor or simile to another in one of Lady Macbeth's well-known speeches:\n\nAnd in Macbeth's preceding speech:\n\nThe audience is challenged to complete the sense. The late romances, with their shifts in time and surprising turns of plot, inspired a last poetic style in which long and short sentences are set against one another, clauses are piled up, subject and object are reversed, and words are omitted, creating an effect of spontaneity.\n\nShakespeare's poetic genius was allied with a practical sense of the theatre. Like all playwrights of the time, Shakespeare dramatised stories from sources such as Petrarch and Holinshed. He reshaped each plot to create several centres of interest and show as many sides of a narrative to the audience as possible. This strength of design ensures that a Shakespeare play can survive translation, cutting and wide interpretation without loss to its core drama. As Shakespeare's mastery grew, he gave his characters clearer and more varied motivations and distinctive patterns of speech. He preserved aspects of his earlier style in the later plays, however. In his late romances, he deliberately returned to a more artificial style, which emphasised the illusion of theatre.\n\nIn some of Shakespeare's early works, punctuation at the end of the lines strengthen the rhythm. He and other dramatists at the time used this form of blank verse for much of the dialogue between characters to elevate the poetry of drama. To end many scenes in his plays he used a rhyming couplet, thus creating suspense. A typical example occurs in \"Macbeth\" as Macbeth leaves the stage to murder Duncan:\n\nHis plays make effective use of the soliloquy, in which a character makes a solitary speech, giving the audience insight to the character's motivations and inner conflict. The character either speaks to the audience directly (in the case of choruses, or characters that become epilogues), or more commonly, speaks to himself or herself in the fictional realm. Shakespeare's writing features extensive wordplay of double entendres and clever rhetorical flourishes. Humour is a key element in all of Shakespeare's plays. His works have been considered controversial through the centuries for his use of bawdy punning, to the extent that \"virtually every play is shot through with sexual puns.\" Indeed, in the nineteenth century, popular censored versions of the plays were produced as \"The Family Shakspeare\" by Henrietta Bowdler (writing anonymously) and later by her brother Thomas Bowdler. Comedy is not confined to Shakespeare's comedies, and is a core element of many of the tragedy and history plays. For example, comic scenes dominate over historical material in Henry IV, Part 1.\n\nBesides following the popular forms of his day, Shakespeare's general style is comparable to several of his contemporaries. His works have many similarities to the writing of Christopher Marlowe, and seem to reveal strong influences from the Queen's Men's performances, especially in his history plays. His style is also comparable to Francis Beaumont's and John Fletcher's, other playwrights of the time.\n\nShakespeare often borrowed plots from other plays and stories. \"Hamlet\", for example, is comparable to Saxo Grammaticus' \"Gesta Danorum\". \"Romeo and Juliet\" is thought to be based on Arthur Brooke's narrative poem \"The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet\". \"King Lear\" is based on the story of King Leir in \"Historia Regum Britanniae\" by Geoffrey of Monmouth, which was retold in 1587 by Raphael Holinshed. Borrowing plots in this way was not uncommon at the time. After Shakespeare's death, playwrights quickly began borrowing from his works, a tradition that continues to this day.\n\nShakespeare's works express the complete range of human experience. His characters were human beings who commanded the sympathy of audiences when many other playwrights' characters were flat or archetypes. Macbeth, for example, commits six murders by the end of the fourth act, and is responsible for many deaths offstage, yet still commands an audience's sympathy until the very end because he is seen as a flawed human being, not a monster. Hamlet knows that he must avenge the death of his father, but he is too indecisive, too self-doubting, to carry this out until he has no choice. His failings cause his downfall, and he exhibits some of the most basic human reactions and emotions. Shakespeare's characters were complex and human in nature. By making the protagonist's character development central to the plot, Shakespeare changed what could be accomplished with drama.\n\nAll references to \"Hamlet\", unless otherwise specified, are taken from the Arden Shakespeare Q2.

Recognising the need for education but with no responsibility to provide it, the London County Council transferred 24 acres on the western edge of the estate to Essex County Council, who built a technical college (the South East Essex Technical College) and a secondary school (South East Essex County Technical High School) on the site. The College opened in 1936, in a building designed by J.Stuart.\n\nDuring World War II, the College was commandeered by the British Army and the Royal Air Force. The secondary school moved to a new site in Cannington Road in 1960 and was renamed the South East Essex Technical High School. The technical college was renamed Barking Regional College of Technology in 1965, following the creation of the London Borough of Barking. In 1969 it became the Barking Campus of the North East London Polytechnic, which in turn became the Polytechnic of East London in 1988 and the University of East London in 1992.

It is used as an office and meeting rooms.\n\nStanley Palace was built in 1591 on the site of the former Black (Dominican) Friary. It was built as the town house for Sir Peter Warburton, a local lawyer and Member of Parliament. When he died in 1621 the house was inherited by his daughter. She married Sir Thomas Stanley who gave his name to the house. After the Civil Wars James Stanley (The 7th Earl) was held under arrest at the house, and transported to Bolton for execution. Part of the house was demolished and the southwest wing was rebuilt in the early 18th century. The house then ceased to be a mansion house and by the early 19th century it had been divided into apartments and its condition was deteriorating. It was bought by the Chester Archaeological Society in 1865 and during the 1870s housed a boys' school. The building was sold to the 15th Earl of Derby in 1889. In the early 1920s the building contained \"a museum of 1,000 curios\". The house was given to Chester Corporation in 1928.

It was published in 1991, a few months after Dahl's death in November 1990, and is the author's final contribution to literature after an illustrious career spanning almost half a century. The book was republished in 2017 under the title Billy and the Minpins with new illustrations by Quentin Blake.\n\nLittle Billy is forbidden by his mother to enter the Forest of Sin behind his house. She tells him of the Whangdoodle, Hornswogglers, Snozzwanglers and Vermicious knids that live in the forest. Worst of all is the Terrible Blood-suckling Tooth-puckling Stone-chuckling Spittler, who chases his prey while glowing clouds of hot smoke pour out of his nose, and then swallows them up in one gulp. Little Billy doesn't believe his mother, and the Devil whispers to Little Billy that the monsters don't exist, and there is a plethora of luscious wild strawberries in the forest. Soon, Little Billy is walking through the forest when he hears something coming after him, and runs to escape it. As he looks back, he sees puffs of orange-red smoke catching up with him. \n\nHe escapes what he is sure must be the Spittler by climbing up a tree as high and as fast as he can. When he comes to a rest, he notices windows opening all over the branches, and discovers a whole city of little people, the Minpins, living inside the tree. The leader of the Minpins, Don Mini, tells Little Billy that the monster waiting under the tree is not the Spittler (which the Minpins have never heard of), but the Red-Hot Smoke-Belching Gruncher, who grunches up everything in the forest. It seems that there is no way for Little Billy to safely get down from the tree and return home. \n\nBut upon learning of the close friendship between the Minpins and birds, Little Billy devises a plan to rid the forest of the Gruncher: Little Billy flies on the back of a swan and uses his scent to lure the Gruncher into a lake. The water of the lake puts out the fire in the Gruncher's belly, killing him. The Minpins are grateful to Little Billy for ridding the forest of their tormentor. They reward him by sending the swan to serve as Little Billy's own personal transport every night, which he uses to explore the world and to continue his newfound friendship with the Minpins.\n\n"}
{"id": "20863617", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20863617", "title": "The Pastellists", "text": "The Pastellists\n\nThe Pastellists was an organization of artists that formed in New York at the end of 1910 for the purpose of exhibiting artwork produced in the medium of pastel. The group helped organize four exhibitions in New York between 1910 and 1914 before disbanding in 1915. Some Pastellist members are credited with the initial idea for the exhibition that later became the 1913 Armory Show, the first major exhibition of European modernism in America.\n\nMany artists worked in pastel but few organizations were promoting or including pastel works in their annual exhibitions. The exhibit at the Rand School, organized by Leon Dabo in 1909 and the Exhibition of Independent Artists, organized by Robert Henri, in 1910, had fostered a desire among artists to present more personal work and exhibit irrespective of the expectations of conservative organizations like the National Academy. That year, Dabo became leader of The Pastellists.\n\nA diary kept by the secretary/treasurer of the Pastellists, artist Elmer Livingston MacRae, records the activities of the young group during their first two exhibitions. The president was Leon Dabo and the Board of Control included Jerome Myers, Everett Shinn, and Juliet Thompson. Mr. Dabo engaged his lawyer and artist friend Henry Wellington Wack to draw up the papers for incorporation, which were agreed upon at a members meeting on February 15, 1911. There are no known records by MacRae or other artists of the member meetings or the later exhibitions.\n\nThe first two exhibitions, were held at the Folsom Galleries and according to the MacRae diaries, met with good reviews and high attendance. \"The New York Times\" said the second show \"surpasses in interest its predecessor, which certainly was sufficiently charming.\" A \"striking and important\" work was \"L'enfant a l'orange\" by Mary Cassatt; \"Big Wave Design\" by Arthur Bowen Davies had \"vigor and free handling, with the addition of a feeling for great rhythms\".\n\nThe daily newspapers chronicled the activities of the Pastellists and we do know that the third exhibition was held at Powell Art Gallery and artists like Arthur B. Davies, Walt Kuhn, and Edward Adam Kramer had become regular exhibitors. Guests like Gutzon Borglum showing some large figure works and Max Weber with \"his cube forms, his weird women, his astonishing color schemes\", caused such a stir that one critic wrote that the show was “the best exhibition yet held by the progressive and gifted artists constituting this group.”\n\nThe fourth exhibition, held at the National Arts Club, was a sister exhibit to a Contemporary Art Exhibition held in the main galleries at the same time.\n\nBy 1915 the American Art Annual listed the Pastellists as \"Inactive.\" It is notable that several of the members of the Pastellists were the same activist artists that exhibited in the initial, non-juried MacDowell Club shows, again organized by Robert Henri. Many of these more radical artists came together to create the \"Association of American Painters and Sculptors\", the group that mounted the infamous Armory Show of 1913.\n\nAn account states that one evening after a successful day at the second Pastellist exhibition, a few of the artists began to discuss forming a larger organization of artists, that would include not only easel painter but sculptors as well. The new organization was to exist for the express purpose of mounting large scale exhibitions, using the same progressive ideas of the Pastellists and the MacDowell exhibits, creating shows that would rival the more conservative juried exhibitions of the National Academy. Like the American Painters and Sculptors, the Pastellists may not have been in existence very long but the impact they had on the American art scene, reached far into the future.\n\nPastel is an art medium in the form of a stick, consisting of pure powdered pigment and a binder. The pigments used in pastels are the same as those used to produce all colored art media, including oil paints; the binder is of a neutral hue and low saturation. The color effect of pastels is closer to the natural dry pigments than that of any other process.\n\nSome of the artists involved with The Pastellists.\n"}

As he became more acquainted with the players involved, he found that many of the most successful quants knew each other and carried similar eccentricities. Realizing this was a world that the average investor knew little of, Patterson wrote the book to shed light on the strategies, players, and related risks of such trading strategies.\n\nThe introduction to \"The Quants\" describes the real-life, annual, high-stakes poker match between Wall Street's hedge fund managers, comparing their trading styles to their poker strategies. It focuses on, among other things, the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis and how it helped trigger a sudden and massive unwind of complex, highly leveraged quantitative strategies. The book also delves into critical short-comings of many quantitative strategies, such as their tendency to lead to crowded trades and their underestimation of the likelihood of chaotic, volatile moves in the markets.\n\nThe book also delves into the background of the various vanguards of quantitative analysis.
