{"id": "591309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=591309", "title": "A Bronx Tale", "text": "A Bronx Tale\n\nA Bronx Tale is a 1993 American crime drama film, adapted from Chazz Palminteri's 1989 play of the same name. It tells the coming of age story of an Italian-American boy, Calogero Anello, who, after encountering a local Mafia boss, is torn between the temptations of organized crime and the values of his honest, hardworking father. The Broadway production was converted to film with limited changes, and starred Palminteri and Robert De Niro.\n\nDe Niro, who first viewed the play in Los Angeles in 1990, acquired the rights from Palminteri, intent on making the play his directorial debut. The duo then worked heavily together on the screenplay, with Palminteri aiming to retain many of the aspects of the original script, as it was based largely on his own childhood. Production began in 1991, and was funded in collaboration with De Niro's TriBeCa Productions and Savoy Pictures, as the first film released by each studio.\n\nUpon its release on September 29, \"A Bronx Tale\" achieved limited commercial success, grossing over $17 million domestically. However, it fared much better with critics, who praised the performances of the leads, and launched Palminteri's acting career, while also helping De Niro gain acceptance as a director.\n\nIn 1960, Lorenzo Anello lives in Belmont, an Italian-American neighborhood in The Bronx, with his wife Rosina and his 9-year-old son Calogero, who is fascinated by the local mobsters led by Sonny LoSpecchio. One day, Calogero witnesses a murder committed by Sonny in defense of an assaulted friend in his neighborhood. When Calogero chooses to keep quiet when questioned by NYPD detectives, Sonny takes a liking to him and gives him the nickname \"C\". Sonny's men offer Lorenzo a better paying job, but Lorenzo, preferring a law-abiding life as an MTA bus driver, politely declines. Sonny befriends Calogero and introduces him to his crew. Calogero earns tips amounting to $600 working in the Mafia bar and throwing dice, and is admonished harshly by Lorenzo when he discovers it. Lorenzo speaks severely to Sonny, returns the money, and angrily warns him to keep away from Calogero.\n\nEight years later, Calogero has grown into a young man who has been visiting Sonny regularly without his father's knowledge. Calogero is also part of a gang of local Italian-American boys, which concerns Sonny, who warns Calogero to keep away from them and focus more on his schoolwork. Later on, Calogero meets a black girl, Jane Williams, and is smitten with her. Despite the high level of racial tension and dislike between Italian Americans and African Americans, Calogero arranges a date with Jane. He asks for advice from both his father and Sonny, with the latter lending Calogero his car so he can make a good impression. Later, Calogero's friends beat up some black cyclists who ride through their neighborhood, despite Calogero's attempts to defend them. One of the cyclists turns out to be Jane's brother, Willie. Willie mistakes Calogero for one of the assailants and accuses him of beating him up when Calogero and Jane meet for their date. Calogero loses his temper over the accusation and Willie's lack of gratitude, responding by accidentally addressing him with a racial slur, which he instantly regrets. Jane, disappointed, leaves with Willie.\n\nAt home, Calogero is confronted by his father who just saw him driving Sonny's car. An argument ensues and Calogero storms out. Shortly thereafter, Calogero is confronted by Sonny and his crew, who found a bomb in Sonny's car and suspected Calogero of planning to assassinate him. Calogero tearfully proclaims how he has come to view Sonny as a father and would never hurt him, and Sonny recognizes Calogero's innocence and allows him to leave. Lorenzo emerges to defend his son and confront Sonny, but is held back by Sonny's men. The black boys egg the Italian-American boys' usual spot in retaliation for the previous beating, and Calogero's friends make a plan to strike back using Molotov cocktails. They pick up Calogero in their car and try to force him to participate, but Sonny stops the car and orders Calogero out, warning them to stay away from Calogero. Calogero catches up with Jane, who tells him that Willie had since admitted that Calogero had tried to help him from the other boys who beat him up. Jane and Calogero make amends, but Calogero suddenly remembers his friends' plans to attack Jane's neighborhood and the two rush to stop them. During the attack, one of the Molotov cocktails is thrown back into the car window, igniting the remaining bottles. The resulting crash and explosion kills everyone inside. Calogero and Jane arrive to find Calogero's friends dead, and Calogero realizes that Sonny had saved his life.\n\nCalogero rushes back to his neighborhood and makes his way through the crowded bar to thank Sonny and inform him of what happened, but an unnamed assailant shoots Sonny in the back of the head before Calogero can warn him. Calogero later learns that the assailant was the son of the man Sonny killed in front of Calogero's house eight years earlier. At Sonny's funeral, countless people come to pay their respects. When the crowd disperses, a lone man, Carmine, visits the funeral, claiming that Sonny once saved his life as well. Calogero does not recognize Carmine until he sees a scar on his forehead and realizes he was the assaulted man whom Sonny had defended eight years ago. Carmine tells Calogero that he will be taking care of the neighborhood for the time being, and promises Calogero help should he ever need anything. Carmine leaves just as Calogero's father unexpectedly arrives to pay his respects to Sonny, thanking him for saving his son's life and admitting that he had never hated Sonny, but merely resented him for making Calogero grow up so quickly. Calogero makes peace with his father, and the two walk home together as Calogero narrates the lessons he learned from his two mentors.\n\nAfter acquiring the rights to create the film, with De Niro famously claiming the deal was struck solely with a gentlemen's agreement with Palminteri, the duo began crafting the screenplay. Prior to partnering with De Niro, Palminteri rejected several offers for the film's rights, including some as high as $1 million, if he was not granted the roles of primary screenwriter and Sonny, the gangster Calogero meets. This was due to the original play, which was performed as a one-man show, being largely inspired by or drawn from his own childhood, specifically the shooting Calogero witnesses as a child, as well as the occupation and name of his father.\n\n\"A Bronx Tale\" received positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an approval rating of 96% based on 28 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"A Bronx Tale\" sets itself apart from other coming-of-age dramas thanks to a solid script, a terrific cast, and director Robert De Niro's sensitive work behind the camera.\" Metacritic gave it a weighted average score of 80 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating \"generally positive reviews\".\n\nCritic Roger Ebert gave the film four stars, calling it \"very funny [and] very touching. It is filled with life and colorful characters and great lines of dialogue, and De Niro, in his debut as a director, finds the right notes as he moves from laughter to anger to tears [while] retaining its values.\"\n\nIn 2008, the American Film Institute nominated this film for its Top 10 Gangster Films list.\n\nSometime after the film's theatrical run, HBO released the movie on VHS, CD and in 1998 on DVD. The DVD is out of print, but in January 2010, Focus Features released a DVD copy of the film exclusive to online-retailer Amazon.\n\n"}
{"id": "33971306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33971306", "title": "Aboriginal sites of Victoria", "text": "Aboriginal sites of Victoria\n\nAboriginal sites of Victoria form an important record of human occupation for probably more than 40,000 years. They may be identified from archaeological remains, historical and ethnographic information or continuing oral traditions and encompass places where rituals and ceremonies were performed, occupation sites where people ate, slept and carried out their day to day chores, and ephemeral evidence of people passing through the landscape, such as a discarded axe head or isolated artefact.\n\nVictorian Aboriginal sites include shell middens, scarred trees, cooking mounds, rock art, burials, ceremonial sites and innumerable stone artefacts. These stone flakes represent the tools Aboriginal people used, such as knives, spear points, scrapers and awls, and the waste material left behind when they were made. Commonly referred to as \"stone artefact scatters\" such sites can be found on the surface or exposed by ploughing or erosion, or through careful archaeological excavation.\n\nScarred trees result from removing bark for the manufacture of shields, coolamons, shelters and other utensils can be found where appropriate species of tree of sufficient age survive. Some trees were marked with designs and symbols. A large river red gum with a canoe scar is located at Heide Gallery in Bulleen.\n\nThere have been more than 60 rock art sites identified in the Grampians National Park which contains about 80% of the known Aboriginal rock art sites in Victoria, with a number of new discoveries after the fires of January 2006. They depict humans, human hands, animal tracks and birds, while some are open to the public and are readily accessible including: Billimina (Glenisla shelter), Jananginj Njani (Camp of the Emu's Foot), Manja (Cave of Hands), Larngibunja (Cave of Fishes), Ngamadjidj (Cave of Ghosts), and Gulgurn Manja (Flat Rock). Nearby Bunjil's Shelter, which illustrates Bunjil, the creator, is in the Black Range near Stawell. A painting thought to be of a thylacine (Tasmanian tiger) is noted from Mt Pilot and the paintings at Mudgegonga rock shelter in north-eastern Victoria are possibly 3500 years old.\n\nCeremonial sites are rare, but two large stone arrangements have been found at Wurdi Youang near Mount Rothwell and Carisbrook. others have been identified from Oral tradition, although archaeological remains are no longer evident such as the Corroboree Tree at Richmond oval was a significant gathering place for the Wurundjeri people. A number of earth rings have been identified in Sunbury, which, although lacking historical or ethnographic evidence, have been interpreted as ceremonial Bora rings.\n\nEvidence of stone quarrying is rare, but the Mount William stone axe quarry is one of a number of stone sources used for making tools which were traded long distances throughout central and western Victoria and into New South Wales.\n\nOnly a relatively small number of burials have been identified in Victoria, most of which are associated with sand dunes along the coast or in the north west of the state. Kow Swamp is particularly significant for evidence of 13000 year old burial rituals using a headband of kangaroo incisors similar to those worn by Aboriginal people until recently, and for consistent burial practices over a long period. A burial on the banks of the Werribee river has been dated to about 7300 years ago.\n\nShell middens occur along most of the coastline and some lake-shores and river banks. Most of these were relatively recent (due to the mobile nature of sand) such as Seal Point and Moonlight Head in the Otway Ranges, although some like Mallacoota Inlet in eastern Gippsland have been dated to more than 2500 years ago, and Wilsons Promontory 6500 years ago.\n\nLarge earth mounds were built up by deliberate transport of soil and the remains of clay heat retainers in hearths, the collapse of seasonally abandoned turf huts and camp activities. Examples have been found on the Hopkins River flood plain in central western Victoria, and in the Nyah Forest, the oldest is dated to about 2500 years ago.\n\nFish and eel traps were constructed on many rivers, and while most were probably of organic materials and have left little trace, some, such as at Lake Condah in western Victoria reveal complex systems of excavated channels and stone weirs, dated to 3000 years ago. Stone artefacts found near the bones of now extinct megafauna at Lancefield in central Victoria have suggested Aboriginal people were living alongside giant marsupials 26,000 years ago.\n\nWhile rock shelters are often the sites of cave painting and other art, they also provide deeply stratified occupation deposits because they are protected from erosion. New Guinea II cave on the Snowy River near Buchan has deposits more than 10 000 years old along with delicate cave paintings and engravings. Rock shelters were occupied in the Cape Bridgewater area about 12,000 years ago. Cloggs Cave rock shelter near Buchan, Victoria was occupied about 18,000 years ago, where bone tools and animal remains were found. At the Keilor Archaeological Site a human hearth excavated in 1971 was radiocarbon-dated to about 31,000 years BP, making Keilor one of the earliest sites of human habitation in Australia, while at Box Gully on Lake Tyrrell, emu eggs and other artefacts have been dated to 27,000 years ago.\n\nStone artefact scatters are among the most common site types and provide evidence of tool use and manufacture. These are often extensive surface scatters and deep stratified deposits of flaked finegrained stone, of lithic flakes. Much of this material is waste flakes, discarded during the manufacture process. Specific types of artefacts such as blades, scrapers or burins may indicate what the area was used for, for example processing animal skins. Stone artefact material is usually rine grained silcrete, chert, and quartz. Hornfels is an unusual and rare material, but is highly distinctive.\n\nArchaeological evidence points to people first arriving in Australia around 50,000 years ago and in Victoria shortly after. Sites over 22,000 years old have been found at Kow Swamp Archaeological Site and the Keilor archaeological site. A cranium found at the site has been dated at between 12,000 and 14,700 years BP.\n\nThe oldest archaeological site in the greater Melbourne area, and one of the most important, is at Keilor on the Maribyrnong River. A human skull discovered there in 1940 was later found to be around 13 000 years old, older than any other human remains found in Australia up to that time, and the find attracted worldwide attention. After small excavations in the 1960s and 1970s, archaeologists from La Trobe University and the Victoria Archaeological Survey (VAS) began an excavation that continued for five years finding a sequence of stone tools and butchered animal bone.\n\nWhilst most evidence of Aboriginal settlement is derived from camp sites where fireplaces, remains of stone tool making and sometimes structures such as mounds and huts can be found, and these sites are almost always located close to reliable water sources, the distribution of Aboriginal archaeological sites demonstrates occupation of all the climatic zones in Victoria, even during the extreme global climatic conditions at the peak of the Last Glacial Maximum when temperatures were colder, vast amounts of surface water were frozen in glaciers and sea levels were lower. Around 18,000 BP sea levels were about 65 metres below present day levels, while archaeological evidence has shown that people were present in south‐eastern Australia throughout all of the climatic changes of at least the last 30,000 years ranging from the deep gorges and highlands of East Gippsland such as at Clogg’s Cave, and New Guinea II cave, the riverine plains at Keilor, the inland plains and swamps such as Kow Swamp, and the eastern ranges at the Grampians.\n\nAll Aboriginal archaeological sites and relics in Victoria are protected under the Aboriginal Heritage Act 2006, and are administered by Aboriginal Affairs Victoria, in some instances through delegation to Registered Aboriginal Parties. All known sites are recorded on the Victorian Aboriginal Heritage Register (VAHR), which is maintained by Aboriginal Affairs Victoria. There were approximately 30,000 places and objects included on the register to date.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4411452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4411452", "title": "Asturian architecture", "text": "Asturian architecture\n\nPre-Romanesque architecture in Asturias is framed between the years 711 and 910, the period of the creation and expansion of the kingdom of Asturias.\n\nIn the 5th century, the Goths, a Christianized tribe of Eastern Germanic origin, arrived in the Iberian peninsula after the fall of the Roman empire, and dominated most of the territory,\nattempting to continue Roman order by the so-called \"Ordo Gothorum\".\n\nIn the year 710, the Visigothic king Wittiza died, and instead of being succeeded by the eldest of his three sons, Agila, the throne was usurped by the duke of Baetica, Roderic. The young heir sought support to recover the throne, and apart from local backing, he approached the Muslim Kingdom in northern Africa. Tarik, the caliph of Damascus governor in Tangier, received permission to offer his army and disembark in Spain, ready to face the Visigothic army of King Roderic.\n\nOn July 19, 711, the battle of Guadalete took place near Gibraltar, where supporters of Witiza's heir, backed by Tarik's Muslim army, killed King Roderic and destroyed the Visigothic army. Tarik and his troops then took advantage of their military superiority, and marched on the Visigothic capital, Toledo, taking it almost without opposition.\n\nAccording to the chronicles, Asturian mercenaries, who had already been recruited by the Romans for their courage and fighting spirit, fought alongside King Roderic. These warriors, together with the rest of the retreating Gothic army, sought refuge in the mountains of Asturias, where they also tried to safeguard some of the sacred relics from Toledo cathedral, the most important of which was the Holy Ark, containing a large number of relics from Jerusalem.\n\nThe kingdom of Asturias arose exactly seven years later, in 718, when the Astur tribes, rallied in assembly, decided to appoint Pelayo as their leader, a person of uncertain origin, since for some chroniclers he was a Visigothic nobleman who fled from the Muslim conquerors and for others he was an indigenous nobleman associated with the Visigothic kingdom. Whatever the case, Pelayo joined the local tribes and the refuged Visigoths under his command, with the intention of progressively restoring Gothic Order, based on the kingdom of Toledo's political model.\n\nThe kingdom of Asturias disappeared with King Alfonso III, who died in December of the year 910. In barely two hundred years, the 12 kings of the dynasty founded by Pelayo were to gradually recover territory from the Muslims (León, Galicia and Castile), a process which finally required the court to be moved south, to León, for its strategic position in the struggle that culminated 800 years after it had started (1492) with the taking of Granada and the expulsion of the last Arabic king from the Iberian Peninsula. The symbol of the flag of Asturias, a golden cross (significantly called \"La Victoria\"), and a blue background with the Latin motto \"Hoc signo, tvetvr pivs, Hoc signo vincitvr inimicvs\" (With this sign the pious is protected, With this sign you shall defeat the enemy), sums up the unified character that Christianity gave the armed struggle.\n\nAsturian Pre-Romanesque is a singular feature in all Spain, which, while combining elements from other styles (Visigothic, Mozarabic and local traditions), created and developed its own personality and characteristics, reaching a considerable level of refinement, not only as regards construction, but also in terms of decoration and gold ornamentation. This last aspect can be seen in such relevant works as the Cross of the Angels, the Victory Cross, the agate Box (housed in the Holy Chamber of Oviedo Cathedral), the Reliquary in Astorga Cathedral and the Cross of Santiago.\n\nAs court architecture, the situation of Pre-Romanesque monuments followed in the wake of the various locations of the kingdom's capital; from its original site in Cangas de Onís (Eastern Asturias), through Pravia (west of the central coast), to its final location in Oviedo, the region's geographical centre.\n\nAs regards its evolution, from its appearance, Asturian Pre-Romanesque followed a \"\"stylistic sequence closely associated with the kingdom's political evolution, its stages clearly outlined\".\"\nFive stages are distinguished; a first period (737–791) belonging to the reigns of the kings Fáfila, Alfonso I, Fruela I, Aurelio, Silo, Mauregato and Vermudo I. A second stage comprises the reign of Alfonso II (791–842), entering a stage of stylistic definition, and third comprises the reigns of Ramiro I (842–850) and Ordoño I (850–866); a fourth belongs to the reign of Alfonso III (866–910) and a fifth and last which coincides with the transfer of the court to León, the disappearance of the kingdom of Asturias, and simultaneously, of Asturian Pre-Romanesque.\n\nFrom this period, of the young kingdom's rise and consolidation, the existence of two churches have been registered. The Church of Santa Cruz (737) at the court's original location, Cangas de Onís, of which we only have written references, because it was destroyed in 1936. The present-day one dates from 1950 and, like the original, is built over a barrow covering a dolmen. The legend goes that the name Santa Cruz (\"Holy Cross\") comes from the oaken cross carried by King Pelayo in the battle of Covadonga, the first \"little-big victory\" against the Arabs, which was later to be covered in gold and precious stones (reign of Alfonso III), coming to be called \"La Victoria\", and emblem of the Asturian flag. Chronicles state that the Church of Santa Cruz was built in stone masonry, one nave with a barrel vault and a main chapel on one side. \n\nThe second of these constructions is the Church of San Juan Apóstol y Evangelista, Santianes de Pravia, located in Santianes. Its construction results from the move of the royal court from Cangas de Onís to Pravia, an old Roman settlement (Flavium Navia) and crossroads. The church, built between the years 774 and 783, already showed a number of elements anticipating Asturian Pre-Romanesque; eastward-facing, basilica ground plan (central nave and two side aisles), separated by three semicircular arches, transept facing the central nave with the same length as the width of the three aisles. It also had a single, semicircular apse, and an external entrance vestibule, with a wooden ceiling over the nave.\n\nSeveral sculptural decorative elements showing floral and geometric designs (something habitual in what were to be the characteristics of subsequent Pre-Romanesque), are on public display in the sacristy, where there is a museum.\n\nAlfonso II, known as \"the Chaste\" (maybe for this reason he never had descendants), was a decisive king in the Asturian monarchy. From a military point of view, he definitively established the kingdom against the Muslims (in the famous battle of Lutos he gained a significant victory), in administration he moved the court to its final site in Oviedo, and in politics he set up cordial, stable relationships with the emperor Charlemagne, as demonstrated by the following quote by Eginardo (Vita caroli): \n\nAs regards patronage of art, Alfonso II promoted the largest number of Pre-Romanesque buildings defining what were to be this style's characteristics. With the royal architect, Tioda, he built the churches of Church of San Tirso, Oviedo, San Julián de los Prados, Santa María de Bendones and San Pedro de Nora, in addition to the palace complex in Oviedo, now disappeared, consisting of the churches of San Salvador, Santa María and its adjoining palace and chapel (now the Holy Chamber of Oviedo Cathedral, the only one remaining), containing relies such as the Holy Ark and jewels, like the Cross of the Angels, which he donated himself to the Church of San Salvador. Outside Asturias, with the legend of the discovery of the apostle St. James' tomb in Galicia, in a place known as \"campus stellae\" (Compostela), Alfonso II had the first church built in the saints honour (year 892).\n\nWhen the Church of San Julián de los Prados, or Santuyano, was built (approx. between the years (812 and 842), it formed part of a series of royal buildings. The church had a basilica ground plan [central nave and two side aisles), separated by three semicircular arches on impost capitals and square columns. It is worth noting the existence of a transept or transversal aisle located between the aisles and the sanctuary, exceeding the central nave in height.\n\nFinally, there was a straight sanctuary, divided into three chapels, and over the main one, only accessible from outside, there was a room whose function is still open to conjecture. As for the roof, the church had an interesting oaken ceiling carved with a variety of geometric designs.\n\nAs elements outside the ground plan, there was a vestibule (to the east) and two sacristies adjoining the north and south facades, communicating directly with the transept. The Church of San Julián de los Prados is the largest of the pre-romanesque churches.\n\nFrom an ornamental point of view, the murals covering the walls and ceilings of this church are the best-conserved upper medieval paintings in Spain. the technique used is \"al fresco\" painting (applied with the plaster still wet), arranged in three well-defined areas. Decorative designs show clear influence of mural painting from the Roman period, recreating a certain atmosphere typical of the \"theatrical style\" (1st century B.C.). Decorative elements are numerous; marble imitation, rectangles, bands, weaving, squares, imitation channeling and columns, medallions decorated with plant motifs, architectural designs, curtains, though totally lacking in any portrayal of biblical or religious scenes, with the single exception of the Anastasis Cross (alpha and omega), as a symbol of royal power. This lack of figurative representation is known as aniconism and was not maintained in later Pre-Romanesque churches.\n\nThe church of San Tirso, located beside the Cathedral of Oviedo, only conserves the end wall of the apse from its original construction, because it was destroyed by fire in the 16th century. The section remaining shows the original construction in stone blocks, and in the centre, there is the characteristic three-point window of Asturian Pre-Romanesque, with semicircular arches made of brick. The central opening, larger than the side ones, is supported by free-standing columns.\n\nThe Holy Chamber was built as a palace chapel for Alfonso II and the church of San Salvador (both demolished in the 14th century to build the present Gothic cathedral). The Chamber, adjoining the pre-Romanesque Tower of San Miguel, also had the function of housing\nrelies brought from Toledo after the fall of the Visigothic kingdom. It consists of two overlapping aisles with a barrel vault; the crypt or lower floor has a height of 2.30 metres, and is dedicated to St. Leocadia, containing several tombs of other martyrs.\n\nThe upper floor, dedicated to St. Michael, was extended in the 12th century, elongating the central section to six metres, a reconstruction that also provided it with its current decoration, a masterpiece of Spanish Romanesque. From an architectural point of view, the Holy Chamber's construction solved one of the greatest problems of Asturian Pre-Romanesque: the vaulting of two overlapping spaces, later used in the buildings of Ramiro I.\n\nAs mentioned above, a from acting as royal chapel, the Holy Chamber was built to house the jewels and relies of the cathedral of San Salvador in Oviedo, a function it continues to have 1,200 years later. Some of these jewels were donated by the Kings Alfonso II and Alfonso III, and represent extraordinary gold artefacts of Asturian Pre-Romanesque.\n\nThe first of them is the Cross of the Angels, created in 808 in Gauzón (the left bank of the estuary of Avilés) on the instructions of Alfonso II of Asturias, who donated the precious stones necessary to make it from his personal treasury. The Cross of the Angels takes its name from the legend that it was made and given to Alfonso II by angels, who appeared to him in the form of pilgrims. The Greek cross (equal arms) has a core of cherry wood and in the centre there is a circular disk acting as connection for the four arms. The anverse is covered with a filigreed mesh of gold thread and bands of geometric decoration with a total of 48 precious stones (agates, sapphires, aamethystss, rubies and opals) of great beauty.The reverse is covered with fine sheet of gold held by silver nails. Decoration on this side shows, mounted on the central disk, a large elliptical agate cameo, and a large stone at the end of each arm.\n\nExactly one century later, in 908, to commemorate a hundred years of the Asturían kingdom's victories and conquests, Alfonso III donated Pre-Romanesque most important gold artifact to Oviedo Cathedral: the Victory Cross or Santa Cruz, a Latin cross (unequal arms) of 92 cm by 72 cm. The core is made of two pieces of oak with circular ends finished in three foils, and joined in the centre by a circular disk. The whole cross is covered with gold leaf and filigree, and richly decorated especially the anverse, covered with coloured enamel, pearls, precious stones and gold thread. The reverse shows an inscription in soldered gold letters, mentioning the donors to the Church of San Salvador, King Alfonso III and Queen Jimena, and the place (Gauzón Castle again) and the year it was made.\n\nThe last of the Pre-Romanesque jewels on in the Holy Chamber of the Cathedral of Oviedo is the Agate box, donated to the church by Fruela II of Asturias (son of Alfonso II), and his wife Nunilo, in the year 910, when he was still a prince. This extraordinary gold artifact in mozarabic style is a rectangular reliquary made from cypress with a semi-pyramidal shaped lid. The covered with gold plate, with 99 little arch shaped openings, framed in woven gold thread, containing agates. The most valuable part of this piece is the upper part of the lid, probably re-used from another, smaller reliquary of Carolingian origin, a hundred years older than the rest. This plaque is decorated with panels of enamel, in turn surrounded by 655 encrusted garnets.\n\nContinuing with the architectural works of the second period of Pre-Romanesque art, the last two are the churches of Santa Maria de Bendones and San Pedro de Nora. The first is located just fíve kilometres from the capital, in a south-east direction, towards the Nalón valley, and was a donation from King Alfonso III and his wife Jimena to San Salvador cathedral, on January 20, 905. Very similar to Santullano, although the ground plan is not the typical basilica of the Pre-Romanesque churches, but has three enclosures at the western end, the central one as an entrance vestibule and two side areas possibly to house parishioners or ecciesiastics. This entrance leads into a single nave with a wooden ceiling, covered by an interesting roof, the same length as the entrance enclosures. The nave adjoins two rectangular side areas, also with a wooden ceiling, whose use seems to associated with the liturgical rites of the period. this nave joined with the sanctuary by three semicircular brick arches, each of which leads into its corresponding chapel, of which only the main or central one is covered with a brick barrel vault, the other two with wooden ceilings.\n\nAbove the main chapel is the \"typical\" chamber, only accessible from outside, through a trefoil window with the standard Pre-Romanesque features; central arch larger than the side ones, resting on two free-standing capitals with rope moulding, and the upper rectangle framed by simple moulding.\n\nIndependent from the church structure, though close to its southern facade, stands the bell tower, on a rectangular ground plan.\n\nThe Church of San Pedro de Nora is located beside the River Nora, about twelve kilometres from Oviedo. This church has the construction style established in Santullano: facing eastwards, vestibule separate from the main structure, basilica-type ground plan, central nave higher than the side aisles, with intersecting wooden roof and lit by Windows with stone lattice. The straight sanctuary is divided into three apses with barrel vaults. As a differentiating element, the apses were joined to each other through the dividing walls by semicircular-arched doors. Like all the churches from this period, there was a room over the apse, only accessible from outside through a trefoil window. The bell tower, separate from the church like in Santa Maria de Bendones, does not belong to the original construction, and stems from an initiative in the seventies by the architect and great restorer of Asturian Pre-Romanesque, Luis Menéndez Pidal y Alvarez.\n\nThis period corresponds with the reigns of Ramiro I and Ordoño I. The first, son of Vermudo I, succeeded Alfonso II when he died without descendants, taking charge of a rapidly expanding kingdom. He was described by chroniclers as \"Virga justitiae\" (baton of justice) because he had to face two internal rebellions by noblemen and due to his enthusiasm in hunting down magic and the black arts, very widespread in Asturias at the time. He also fought the Normans successfully, defeating them in Gijón and A Coruña. Paradoxically, he enjoyed a time of peace with his traditional enemies, the Muslims, which from an artistic point of view allowed him to substantially renew Pre-Romanesque's architecture and decorative style, giving rise to the so-called Ramirian style.\n\nRamiro I was succeeded by his son Ordoño I, who inherited a very solid kingdom from a military perspective, a condition that let him use subjects from the kingdom of Asturias to re-populate abandoned cities on the other side of the mountains, such as Tui, Astorga and León. He measured his military might against the Arabs with varying results; in the battle of Clavijo (year 859) he easily defeated them, though six years later, at Hoz de la Morcuera, his army, led by one of his generals, suffered a defeat, halting the intense re-population work of the first part of his reign.\n\nThe first of the works from this period, the Palace of Santa María del Naranco, involved a significant stylistic, morphological, constructive and decorative renovation of Pre-Romanesque, supplementing it with new, innovative resources, representing a leap forward with respect to immediately previous periods. Built as a recreational palace, it is situated on the southern side of Monte Naranco facing the city, and was originally part of a series of royal buildings located in the outskirts. Its character as a civil building changed in the 12th century when it\nwas converted into a church dedicated to St. Mary.\n\nThis palace's innovations amazed chroniclers, who repeatedly mention it over time. A case in point is the Crónica Silense, written around the year 1015, about 300 years after its construction, and which, on describing Ramiro I, states that \"\"(...)he built many constructions, two miles away from Oviedo, with sandstone and marble in a vaulted work: (...) He also made (...), a palace without wood, of admirable construction and vaulted below and above...\".\"\n\nWhat marvelled the chroniclers for so many centuries were its proportions and slender shapes, its rich, varied decoration and the introduction ofelongated barrel vaults thanks to the transverse \narches, allowing support and eliminating wooden ceilings. This solution, timidly advanced in the Holy Chamber, fully matured in Santa Maria del Naranco.\n\nThe palace, on a rectangular ground plan, has two floors; the lower level, or crypt, quite low, has a central chamber and another two located on either side. The upper floor is accessed via a double exterior stairway adjoining the facade, leading into an identical layout as the lower floor; a central or noble hall with six blind semicircular arches along the walls, supported by columns built into the wall, and a mirador at each end. These are accessed via three arches, similar to those onto the wall, resting on columns with helicoidal rope moulding, typical of Pre-Romanesque. The barrel vault is made from tufa stone, and is held up by six transverso arches resting on consoles.\n\nSanta Maria del Naranco represented a step forward from a decorative point of view by enriching the habitual standards and modeis with elements from painting, gold work and the textile arts. The rich decoration is concentrated in the hall and miradors of the upper floor, where it is especially worth noting the cubic-prismatic capitals (of Byzantine influence), decorated with reliefs framed by cord decoration (from local tradition) in trapezoid and triangular shapes, inside which there are sculpted forms of animals and humans. This kind of motif is repeated on the disks with central medallions located above the blind arches' intersections. The 32 medallions distributed around the building are similar in size and shape, varying the decorative designs and the interior figures (quadrupeds, birds, bunches of grapes, fantastic animáis), a style inherited from the Visigoth period, in turn descended from Byzantine tradition.\n\nThe medallions have decorative bands above them, again framed by rope moulding, inside which four figures are scuipted and arranged symmetrically; the upper two carrying loads on their heads and the lower two representing soldiers on horseback carrying swords. These figures seem to have some kind of symbolic social meaning; the warriors who defend and support the men of prayer (here offeres),or alternatively, the royal and ecclesiastic orders complementing each other.\n\nSanta María del Naranco shows other, equally beautiful and important sculptural elements; for the first time, a Greek cross appears sculpted as emblem of the Asturian monarchy, at the same time protecting the building from all evil, something which was to become habitual in the popular architecture of towns and villages. Other sculptural elements, such as the capitals of Corinthian inspiration on the miradors' triple-arched Windows or the altar stone in the eastern mirador (originally from the neighbouring Church of San Miguel de Liño/Lillo), make this palace the most distinctive building in Pre-Romanesque, a singularity highlighted by being the only palace complex that has lasted until the present day with both Visigothic and Carolingian court structures.\nThe church of San Miguel de Lillo was consecrated by Ramiro I and his wife Paterna in the year 848. It was originally dedicated to St. Mary until, as mentioned above (and shown by the altar located in the eastern mirador of santa María del Naranco), this worship passed to the nearby palace in the 12th century, leaving this church dedicated to St. Michael.\n\nThe last of the churches from this period is Santa Cristina de Lena , located in the Lena district, about 25 km south of Oviedo, on an old Roman road that joined the lands of the plateau with Asturias. The church has a different ground plan to Pre-Romanesque´s traditional basilica. It is a single rectangular space with a barrel vault, with four adjoining structures located in the centre of each facade. The first of these annexes is the typical Austrian Pre-Romanesque vestibule, with a royal tribune on the upper part, accessed via a stairway joined to one of the walls. To the east is the enclosure with the altar, with a single apse, foregoing the traditional Asturian pre-romanesque triple apse, and going back to Visigoth influences. To the north and south respectively, there are two other enclosures through semicircular arches and barrel vaults, whose use was associated with the Hispano-Visigothic liturgy practised in Spain up to the 11th century.\n\nOne of the most particular elements of Santa Cristina de Lena is the existence of the presbytery elevated above floor level in the last section of the central nave, separated from the area intended for the congregation by three arches on marble columns. This separation,\nwhich appears in other Asturian churches, is not repeated in any other with a similar structure. Both the lattices over the arches and the wall enclosing the central arch were re-used from Visigothic origins in the 7th century.\n\nOn the outside of the church, it is worth noting the large number of buttresses (32) which seem in some cases to have a merely aesthetic function. Nearby this church is the Asturian Pre-Romanesque Information Centre, located in the old Norte de la Cobertoria Railway Station.\n\nThis comprises the reign of Alfonso III, who came to the throne at the age of 18, on the death of his father, Ordoño I, marking the zenith of the kingdom of Asturias. Expansion against Islam led him to conquer Oporto and Coimbra in present-day Portugal, and he pushed the borders of the kingdom as far as the Mondego, repopulating Zamora, Simancas, Toro and the whole area known as Campos Góticos. The idea of the Asturian kingdom as a \ncontinuation of the Visigoths in Toledo was fully assumed, involving the obligation to re-conquer all the territory occupied by Muslims. This idea was reflected in the historical chronicles, such as the Crónica Albeldense, written in Oviedo in the year 881, which tells the history of the Gothic kingdom (Ordo Gentis gothorum), followed by the Asturian monarchy (\"Ordo Gothorum Obetensium fíegnum\")T he kingdom's moment of expansion and maturity was also reflected in a cultural revitalisation promoted from the court, involving architectural and artistic renewal.\n\nThe kingdom's progressive expansion and increasing power also kindled the ambition of Alfonso III's three sons (García I, Ordoño II and Fruela II), who, encouraged by a number of noblemen, dispossessed the king and confined him in the town of Boiges (Boides valley, present-day Valdediós). Even so, they allowed him to lead a final campaign against the Muslims in Zamora, where he was victorious once more. He died on his return, in December of the year 910. Described in the chronicles as \"Great King and Emperor\" (Magnus Imperatore ImpemtorNoster),the king who had achieved the kingdom's greatest expansion and consolidation since it was founded by Pelayo, could not prevent his since from splitting it into three parts, Asturias, Galicia and Castile-León, meaning the disappearance of the kingdom of Asturias.\n\nSan Salvador de Valdediós and Santo Adriano de Tuñón are the two churches built by this monarch, in addition to the Foncalada fountain (\"fonte incalata\") in the centre of Oviedo, and the already-mentioned gold artefacts of the Victory Cross and the Agate box.\n\nThe Church of San Salvador de Valdediós stands in the Boides valley (Villaviciosa), the place where Alfonso III was detained when he was dispossessed by his sons, and where there used to be an old convent governed by the Benedictine Order, substituted in the 13th century by the Cistercians. The church known as the \"Bishops' Chapel\" was consecrated on September 16, 893, with seven bishops in attendance, and stands on a classic basilica ground plan with a triple sanctuary, separating the central nave from the side aisles with four semicircular arches.\nAt the western end, there are three enclosures, the central one used as an access vestibule, and two located on the left and right which may have been used to house pilgrims. The vault over the central nave, like the one over the apses, is barrelled with a brick ceiling and decorated with al fresco wall painting, alternating a variety of geometric designs.\n\nThe royal tribune is located above the vestibule, separate from the area intended for the congregation (\"spatium fidelium\") in the central nave, and this from the area devoted to the liturgy by iron grilles, now disappeared. Particular elements of this church include the covered gallery annexed to the southern facade at a later date or Royal Portico, the 50 cm square columns on the central naves arches, the triple-arched window open in the central apse, and the room above it, exclusively accessed from the exterior by a window which here has two openings, compared with the habitual three.\n\nThe Church of Santo Adriano de Tuñón is located on the bank of the River Trubia, next to an old Roman road. Founded on January 24, 891, it stands on a classic basilica ground plan, although in the 17th and 18th centuries it was extended with a nave structure at the western end, and a bell gable. The al fresco paintings in this church are the only remains of Mozarabic painters' work in an Asturian art workshop.\n\nFinally, the Foncalada fountain, the only upper medieval civil construction conserved in Spain, was built on the outside of Oviedo city walls, with stone blocks and an intersecting roof, barrel vault and rectangular ground plan. The intersection of the roof is topped with a triangular pediment, sculpted with the Victory Cross, characteristic of Alfonso III, under which runs the typical inscription of the kingdom of Asturias: \nWith Alfonso III dead and the kingdom of Asturias divided among his sons, Asturian Pre-Romanesque entered its last stage with two constructions. The first of them is the Church of San Salvador de Priesca (a few kilometres from Valdediós), consecrated on September 24, 921, which has the architectural and decorative reference of the model laid down by Santullano, and not subsequent works. In the 17th and 18th centuries, it underwent several reconstructions, altering especially the structures adjoining the vestibule, by communicating them with the side aisles.\n\nThe Church of Santiago de Gobiendes, located near Colunga, next to the sea and the Sueve mountain range, is the last of the Pre-Romanesque churches, and like the previous one, follows the Santullano construction model. In the 17th and 18th centuries, it underwent significant reform, altering the entrance, facade, main and side chapels.\n\n\n"}

They are assistants to their department heads, the gaffer (in charge of electricals) and the key grip (lighting and rigging), respectively. In short, the best boy acts as the foreman for his department. A woman who performs the duties of a best boy may be called best girl.\n\nBest boys are responsible for the day-to-day operation of the lighting or grip department. Their many responsibilities include the hiring, scheduling, and management of crew; the renting, ordering, inventory, and returning of equipment; workplace safety and maintaining discipline within their department; completing timecards and other paperwork; stocking of expendables; loading and unloading production trucks; planning and implementing the lighting or rigging of locations and/or sound stages; coordinating with rigging crews and additional photography units (if applicable); handling relations with the other production departments; overseeing the application of union rules (where relevant); and serving as the day-to-day representative of the department with the unit production manager and coordinator of their department.\n\nThe best boy also commonly accompanies or stands in for the key grip or gaffer during technical scouts. During shooting, the best boy may also cover for the key grip or gaffer when he or she is on break or otherwise away from the set.\n\nOn films with very small crews, the electric (lighting) department often consists of only a gaffer, a best boy, and a few electricians. The grip department may include only a key grip, a best boy, and a few grips. Large-scale productions such as major films commonly include full-time rigging and second unit crews, and in total may hire many dozens of grips or electricians at one time.\n\nIt's unclear why this term came to be used as a job title on film sets. As OED says, \"It has been suggested that it originated as a term for a master's most able apprentice, or alternatively that it was transferred from earlier use for a member of a ship's crew, but confirmatory evidence for either of these theories appears to be lacking.\" The earliest known appearance of the phrase in print is 1931 from the \"Albuquerque Journal\": \"Among the electricians .. the department head is the gaffer, his first assistant is the best boy.\"\n\nAs the gaffer is sometimes credited as the chief lighting technician, the best boy electric is sometimes credited as the assistant chief lighting technician.\n\nThe title is accepted for use in credits by the BBC.\n\nThe end credits of the 1980 comedy film \"Airplane!\" named the Best Boy, then the next line was \"Worst Boy\", naming Adolf Hitler in that position.\n\nMany French language films made in Canada use \"Best Boy\" in the credits. The term has been known to appear in the credits of some French films made in France, but it has not been known to appear in Belgian or Swiss films.\n\nThe German film \"Auf der anderen Seite\" (\"The Edge of Heaven\"), which takes place in Germany and Turkey, uses the term \"Best Boy\" in its German credits. German TV and film crews regularly use the term, because no equivalent phrase exists in German.\n"}

The Grossman Burn Foundation in California pledged to perform reconstructive surgery and began organizing for her visa in the early spring of 2010. Diane Sawyer of ABC News originally covered her ordeal in March 2010 and revisited her story again in 2014.\n\nAisha suffered early in life, losing her mother and forced into marriage as a teenager. In a practice known as baad, Aisha's father promised her to a Taliban fighter when she was 12 years old as compensation for a killing that a member of her family had committed. She was married at 14 and subjected to abuse. At 18 she fled the abuse but was caught by police, jailed for five months, and returned to her family. Her father returned her to her husband's family. To take revenge on her escape, her father-in-law, husband, and three other family members took Aisha into the mountains, cut off her nose and her ears, and left her to die. Aisha was later rescued by aid workers and the U.S. military. Some sources disputed the role of any members of the Taliban in her mutilation.\n\nAisha was featured on the August 2010 cover of \"Time\" magazine, and in the corresponding article, \"Afghan Women and the Return of the Taliban.\" The cover image generated enormous controversy. The image and the accompanying cover title, \"What Happens if We Leave Afghanistan,\" fueled debate about the merits of the Afghan War.\n\nThe photo was taken by the South African photographer Jodi Bieber and was awarded the World Press Photo Award for 2010. The image of Aisha is sometimes compared to the \"Afghan Girl\" photograph of Sharbat Gula taken by Steve McCurry.\n\nShortly after \"Time\"'s cover ran in August 2010, Aisha was flown to the United States to receive free reconstructive surgery. After arriving in California, she psychologically regressed into performing fake seizures, tantrums, and self-harm that required hospitalization. Surgeons concluded that she was not \"emotionally prepared\" to handle the patient responsibilities in the reconstructive surgery process, and her psychologist diagnosed her with borderline personality disorder. While her reconstructive surgery was delayed, she was taken in by the Women for Afghan Women shelter in Queens, New York, but she caused many problems for the staff and other residents, including roommates hired by the shelter to live with her. Aisha's condition improved with a change in medications, and the seizures stopped.\n\nLater, Aisha's psychological condition improved enough that she was able to cease taking medications to control her behavior. Starting in 2012, preparations to do a multistage facial reconstruction for Aisha began. Her forehead was expanded over the course of several months to provide enough tissue to build a new nose. The structure for her new nose was built using cartilage from her own body and tissue from her left hand was also used for the inner lining. Aisha underwent a total of 12 completed surgeries.\n\nIn 2014 ABC News revisited Aisha and revealed her new nose that has altered her appearance. Aisha has been adopted by an Afghan-American couple, and lives in Maryland. She studies English and mathematics and aspires to be a police officer.\n\n"}

It is a relatively new process invented in the US during the 1930s by Hubert Mesibov, Michael J. Gallagher, and Dox Thrash, an artist working in Philadelphia with the WPA). \"Carborundum Collagraph\" collagraph is a different printmaking technique, invented in 1952 by Henri Goetz, an American abstract artist living in Paris. The carborundum mezzotint uses the grits to create pits below the surface of the metal that then hold ink, like traditional mezzotint. The carborundum collagraph creates the image above the surface of the matrix, which does not have to be metal. In one method, the grits are mixed into a paste using an acrylic base that is painted onto the matrix, creating the image much like painting. Once dried, this holds the ink; the wiping and printing are done the same as etching. The techniques described following and below are alternatives to the paste mixture technique, yet all are creating the image above the surface of the matrix. Carbordundum collagraph allows artists to work on a large scale. Normally, cardboard or wood plates are coated in a layer of carborundum or screen, and the lights are created by filling in the texture with screen filler or glue. Carborundum prints may be printed as intaglio plates. \n\nCarborundum was originally used by printmakers to grind down lithography stones and is now used in collagraph prints to create gradients of tone and a sandy texture. It works because when the carborundum adheres to the plate the ink sits around it. It can be applied in a number of different ways:\n\n\nTo print a carborundum print, the surface is covered in ink, and then the surface is wiped clean with \"tarlatan\" cloth or newspaper, leaving ink only in the texture of the screen or carborundum. A damp piece of paper is placed on top, and the plate and paper are run through a printing press that, through pressure, transfers the ink from the recesses of the plate to the paper. Very large editions are not possible as a small amount of carborundum comes off every time it is wiped down.\n\nContrast with relief printing, and with planographic printing techniques such as lithography.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14592469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14592469", "title": "Cat play and toys", "text": "Cat play and toys\n\nCat play and toys incorporates predatory games of \"play aggression\". Cats' behaviors when playing are similar to hunting behaviors. These activities allow kittens and younger cats to grow and acquire cognitive and motor skills, and to socialize with other cats. Cat play behavior can be either solitary (with toys or other objects) or social (with animals and people). They can play with a multitude of toys ranging from strings, to small furry toys resembling what would be prey (e.g. mice), to plastic bags.\n\nObject play for animals (in this case, cats) is the use of inanimate objects by the animal to express play behaviour. In the case of pet domestic cats, humans normally provide them with purchased, human-made toys such as toy mice. When it comes to non-domestic, wild cats, they may use several objects in the wilderness as their toys including sticks, leaves, rocks, feathers, etc. Actions that cats may carry out as this play behaviour include throwing the toy object, chasing, biting, capturing, etc. as they might do with a real source of prey. Engaging in object play helps young cats to practice these skills that they need as they grow into adults.\n\nPlay in cats is a behaviour that is brought about during growth from the kitten stage onward. Some important aspects of this play behaviour for the development of kittens in to adult cats include motor development, social behaviour and cognitive development. There are different types of play that develop at different stages during the development and growth of a kitten. The first play behaviours observed in kittens include things like approaching, pawing and holding onto each other. Following this stage in their development, kittens begin to show an interest in inanimate objects and prey behaviour. This is the development of their nonsocial behaviour in which they become more independent and begin to practice predatory/hunting behaviour. Play behaviour in kittens is also important in providing them with physical exercise as they are growing, as well as providing a means of interacting with other members of their litter to keep strong social bonds among them. Social play is important between litter-mates since this is the main source of play for kittens in early life with little alternative to other means of play. Kittens are limited in room for exploring for other means of play, so engaging in this social play behaviour is important until they have access to other play objects such as toys. \n\nSince cats are meat-eating predators, nearly all cat games are predatory games.\n\nPrey are fearful of predators. Predators often encounter prey that attempt to escape predation. Prey that move towards the cat with confidence may be exhibiting an aggressive defensive posture. Cats often play with toys that behave more like fearful prey trying to escape than toys that mimic more confrontational prey.\n\nSuccess rate is important in play. A cat that catches its prey every time soon gets bored, and a cat that never gets it just loses interest. The ideal hunting success rate is around 1 in 3 to 1 in 6. Capturing prey at this rate generally maximises a cat's interest in the game.\n\nPlay is about predatory behaviour, and a highly excited cat can cause minor injuries in the excitement of the moment. With most cats, it is wise to keep playthings at least 20 cm (8\") away from fingers or eyes and avoid encouraging a cat to eat inedible toys. If playing with a human's bare hands, a cat will generally resist using its claws or biting too hard, but a cat that becomes extremely excited may accidentally inflict injuries to its human playmate in the form of light scratches or small puncture wounds from biting too hard. Cats' claws and mouths can contain bacteria that can lead to infection, so it is wise to clean and treat any wounds with an antiseptic solution and seek professional medical services if there is reason to believe that the wound has become infected.\n\nCatching and eating are two closely related but separate activities. Domestic cats often store caught food for eating later. Eating happens when the game is over, so incorporating food into hunting games tends to end the interest in play. Hidden treats helps engage cat's senses such as sense of smell and can be a form of play which enables them to utilize their searching skills. This idea of treats linked with play helps cats form the association that treats signify happy behaviour.\n\nThere are several different motor patterns associated with the play behaviour of cats and they have different roles in the social context. Pouncing is one of these motor patterns in which it is used to initiate play through physical contact. Chasing and horizontal leaping is an example of a motor pattern that may be used by a cat to end play. The movement of a cat's tail during play and the varying rates at which the cat may move its tail can even be a useful indicator of its level of playfulness. There are patterns of belly-up and stand-up actions that are engaged in by kittens in which seem to show that they prefer to engage in physical contact play in terms of their social role among other kittens.\n\nHunger has been shown to give an increase in intensity in the play behaviour of cats, and a decrease in fear which they show towards larger-sized toys. This effect that hunger has on play behaviour may be attributed to how experienced of a hunter the cat is. It is not expected that a cat who has a higher level of hunting experience would show this increased intensity of their play behaviour when hungry. Instead, they are more likely to show more predatory behaviour. In the case of cats with a lower level of hunting experience, they show this increased play behaviour since they are not able to engage in actual predatory activities and instead show predatory behaviours towards toys when hungry as an experienced hunter would show towards actual prey when hungry.\n\n\n"}

Chinese pigments is similar to Western gouache paint in that it contains more glue than watercolours, but more so than gouache. The high glue content makes the pigment bind better to Chinese paper and silk as well as enabling works of art to survive the wet-mounting process of Chinese hanging scroll mountings without smudging or bleeding.\n\nTraditionally, Chinese pigments come in form of chips, cakes or powder made from natural plant and minerals. Some of these require preparation by adding glue (明膠) before they can be used. Traditional pigments require some skill and knowledge to mix as some pigments do not blend well with others (e.g. herbal and stone colours generally do not combine well). Also, layering a different pigment on top of another can create different effects depending on the type and transparency of the upper layer pigment. \n\nSynthetic versions that already contain glue come in tubes and are more convenient.\n\nOut of the many pigments used for traditional colours, around 12 are basic colours that are widely used. Some of the pigments use natural plant ('herbal') or minerals ('stone') that are poisonous or toxic. Outside of these traditional pigments, other colours are made from synthetic chemicals. \n\n\n\nAll traditional yellow pigments are toxic.

Tabone had the right to enlarge, pull down and rebuilt it, besides he could nominate the Rector and found a Confraternity of the Most Holy Crucifix.\nIn 1575 there was a terrible plague: the population in Alcamo, about 7,700, was cut in half, according to the historian Ignazio De Blasi and a lot of people were buried in the cemetery Sant'Ippolito, in the western suburb. \nAs the old hospitals of \"San Vito\" and \"Santo Spirito\" were not sufficient to receive so many plague victims, they set up a new one in the same street of the Chapel.\n\nOwing to their economic difficulties which did not allow to complete the Church, in 1596 the administrators of the Confraternity decided to assign the Church to the Order of Minims of Saint Francis of Paola. In 1608 the Minims accepted the donation and built the adjoining friary which they maintained until 1866; since 1870 it hosted the Royal Gimnasium, and, after 1870, the Civic Hospital.\nThe Minim Fathers distinguished themselves both for their religious activity and for the social engagement for the quarter; in 1780 forty-five priests from Alcamo signed a request to king Ferdinand III asking not to suppress the friary, as it had happened to other religious orders some years before. The cloister was not closed, but after the Unification of Italy, Vittorio Emanuele II, king of Italy, abolished all religious orders and their properties were seized. \nFinally in 1926 the Church became a parish, dedicated to saint Francis of Paola.\n\nThe façade, dated 1695, has a convex form, a typical characteristic of Rococo Style.\nThe church is with one nave and has five altars; in 1750 it was embellished with stuccoes by Nicolò Curti.\n\nInside it there the following works:\n\nOn the high altar: the Crucifix, a wooden sculpture made in the 19th century, made by Francesco Marino from Trapani.\n\nOn the left side:\n\nOn the right side:\nOn the nave walls there are four old paintings, by an unknown author and with stucco frames, representing some episodes of Saint Francis of Paola’s life:\n\nIn the sacristy:\n\n\n\n"}

Influenced by the German Bauhaus school, many Danish designers used the new industrial technologies, combined with ideas of simplicity and functionalism to design buildings, furniture and household objects, many of which have become iconic and are still in use and production. Prominent examples are the Egg chair, the PH lamps and the Sydney Opera House (Australia).\n\nAmong the most successful designers associated with the concept are Børge Mogensen (1914–72), Finn Juhl (1912–89), Hans Wegner (1914–2007), Arne Jacobsen (1902–71), Poul Kjærholm (1929–80), Poul Henningsen (1894–1967) and Verner Panton (1926–98).\n\nOther designers of note include Kristian Solmer Vedel (1923–2003) in the area of industrial design, Jens Harald Quistgaard (1919–2008) for kitchen furniture and implements, Gertrud Vasegaard (1913–2007) for ceramics, and Ole Wanscher (1903–85), who had a classical approach to furniture design.\n\nThe Danish Culture Canon credits Thorvald Bindesbøll (1846–1908) with early contributions to design in the areas of ceramics, jewellery, bookbinding, silver and furniture although he is known in the rest of the world for creating the Carlsberg logo (1904), still in use today. The Canon also includes Knud V. Engelhardt (1882–1931) for a more industrial approach, especially in the rounded contours of his electric tramcar designs which were widely copied. In the area of textiles, Marie Gudme Leth (1895–1997) brought the screen printing process to Denmark, opening a factory in 1935 which allowed her colourful patterns to be manufactured on an industrial basis. August Sandgren introduced functionalism in the design of his masterful bookbindings. \nIn the late 1940s, shortly after the end of the Second World War, conditions in Denmark were ideally suited to success in design. The emphasis was on furniture but architecture, silver, ceramics, glass and textiles also benefitted from the trend. Denmark's late industrialisation combined with a tradition of high-quality craftsmanship formed the basis of gradual progress towards industrial production. After the end of the war, Europeans were keen to find novel approaches such as the light wood furniture from Denmark. Last but not least, support in Denmark for freedom of individual expression assisted the cause.\n\nThe newly established Furniture School at the Royal Danish Academy of Art played a considerable part in the development of furniture design. Kaare Klint taught functionalism based on the size and proportions of objects, wielding considerable influence. Hans J. Wegner, who had been trained as a cabinetmaker, contributed with a unique sense of form, especially in designing chairs.\n\nAs head of the cooperative FDB furniture design studio, Børge Mogensen designed simple and robust objects of furniture for the average Danish family. Finn Juhl demonstrated an individualistic approach in designing chairs with an appealing but functional look.\n\nIn the early 1950s, American design also influenced Danish furniture. The American Charles Eames designed and manufactured chairs of moulded wood and steel pipes. These encouraged Arne Jacobsen to design his worldfamous Ant Chair, Denmark's first industrially manufactured chair. Furthermore, as Shaker furniture—and especially its reputation for stripped down chairs—began to be more and more known abroad, it also influenced Danish designers.\n\nPoul Kjærholm, Verner Panton and Nanna Ditzel followed a few years later, continuing the successful story of Danish design. Kjærholm worked mainly in steel and leather, Panton left Denmark during the 1960s to continue designing imaginative but highly unconventional plastic chairs while Nanna Ditzel, who also had a strongly individualistic approach, was successful in helping to renew Danish furniture design in the 1980s.\n\nIn the seventies Verner Panton made some of his most important designs. The Pantonova and the 1-2-3 System. They were a rave with the critics, but the consumers at the time found it too spacey. Today however it's true value to the design tradition is obvious. Danish furniture design failed to make any new important contributions in the 1980s. By contrast, industrial designers began to prosper, making use of the basic principles of focus on the user, respect for materials and attention to detail. For example, there are well known Danish designers, like Tobias Jacobsen (the grandson of Arne Jacobsen), who focused on the single elements of a violin when creating his chair \"Vio\" or on a boomerang when designing his eponymous sideboard.\n\nThe Bernadotte & Bjørn studio, established in 1950, was the first to specialise in industrial design, with an emphasis on office machines, domestic appliances and functional articles such as the thermos jug. The electronics manufacturer Bang & Olufsen, in collaboration with Bernadotte & Bjørn and later with Jacob Jensen and David Lewis, went on to excel in modern design work. Around the same time, the Stelton company collaborated with Arne Jacobsen and Erik Magnussen to produce their iconic vacuum jug, a huge international success.\n\nAnother successful design field is medical technology. Danish design companies like 3PART, Designit and CBD have worked in this area with individual designers such as Steve McGugan and Anders Smith.\n\nIn 2002 the Danish Government and the City of Copenhagen launched an effort to establish a world event for design in Copenhagen. Originally understood as a tool for branding traditional Danish design, the non-profit organization \"INDEX:\" shifted focus after worldwide research and coined the concept of Design to Improve Life, which rapidly became celebrated in Denmark and around the world. The organization now hands out the biggest design award in the world biannual in Copenhagen, tours large scale outdoor exhibition around the world, run educational program as well as design labs and hosts a global network.\n\nToday, there is strong focus on design in Denmark as industry increasingly appreciates the importance of design in the business environment. In addition, as part of its trade and industry policy, the Danish government has launched the DesignDenmark initiative which aims to restore Denmark to the international design elite.\n\nModern architecture has also contributed to the concept of Danish design.\n\nArne Jacobsen was not just a furniture designer but one of the leading architects of his times. Among his achievements are the Bellevue Theater and restaurant, Klampenborg (1936), the Århus City Hall (with Erik Møller; 1939–42) and the SAS Royal Hotel (1958–60).\n\nJørn Utzon (1918–2008), Denmark's most widely recognized architect, is remembered for his expressionist Sydney Opera House (1966) and the later Bagsværd Church (1976) with its wavy concrete roof.\n\nHenning Larsen (b. 1925) is the architect who designed the boldly modern Copenhagen Opera House on the island of Holmen which was completed in 2005.\n\nToday, the concept of Danish design is thriving in an ever-wider number of fields. Among recent highlights are:\n\n\n\n"}

This \"Collector\" commissioned Nin, along with other now well-known writers (including Henry Miller and the poet George Barker), to produce erotic fiction for his private consumption. His identity has since been revealed as Roy M.

In her Diary (Oct. 1941), she jokingly referred to herself as \"the madam of this snobbish literary house of prostitution, from which vulgarity was excluded\".\n\nWhile using the Kama Sutra and other writings such as those of Krafft-Ebing as models, Nin was very conscious that the languages of male and female sexuality were distinct.

He was the father of French writer Miguel Zamacoïs, and brother of the writer Niceto de Zamacois, the singer Elisa Zamacois and the actor Ricardo Zamacois, and also uncle of the writer Eduardo Zamacois.\n\nEduardo María Zamacois y Zabala was born in Bilbao, Spain. Son of Miguel Antonio de Zamacois y Berreteaga, and his second wife, Ruperta María del Pilar de Zabala y Arauco. His father was the founder and director of the Santiago de Vizcaya School of Humanities. His relatives included numerous artists: writers, actors and musicians. Of family of Basque ancestry, their surname originated in Hasparren, France, where their surname was spelled \"Samacoys\" at 18th century.\nHe received a thorough education, which included drawing classes with a local artist named Joaquín Balaca (c.1820-?). Later, when his father's school closed, the family moved to Madrid and, in 1856, he was enrolled at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, where he studied with Federico de Madrazo.\n\nIn 1860, on Madrazo's recommendation, he went to Paris and attended the classes of Charles Gleyre in preparation for applying to the Ècole des Beaux-Arts. His application there was denied, so he turned to the workshops of Ernest Meissonier, where he found a position.\n\nA skillful business negotiator, he strove to gain access to as many European exhibitions as possible. Success came quickly. In 1861, he was commissioned to create decorative paintings in the quarters of the future king, Alfonso XII at the Palacio Real de Madrid. This work won him a grant from the , which enabled him to continue his studies. In 1862 and 1864, he was awarded medals at the National Exhibition of Fine Arts.\n\nHe was married in Paris in 1865, to Louise Marie Héloise Perrin, whom he had met at the home of his friend, Jehan Georges Vibert. They had two children: Miguel Louis Pascual, who became a well-known journalist and playwright, and a posthumous daughter, Marie Hélène, (who married the painter, Jean Alfred Marioton). \n\nIn 1866, he became good friends with the painter, Marià Fortuny, who did a portrait etching of him. During a trip to Rome, Zamacois also posed as a toreador for Fortuny's painting, \"The Spanish Wedding\". Later, he contacted his friend, , and put him in touch with Fortuny, which resulted in an exclusive contract with Goupil & Cie; a turning point in Fortuny's career.\n\nIn 1870, he was awarded the Gold Medal at the Salon for his painting, \"The Education of a Prince\". After a showing in London, one of his paintings was purchased by Charles Dickens.\n\nThe Franco-Prussian War created difficulties that eventually forced him to return to Madrid. His arrival there coincided with the official coronation of King Amadeus I, and he attended the ceremonies. It was an unusually cold winter and he became ill the following day. He died there suddenly, aged 29, of what was described as \"gangrenous angina\" (possibly Diphtheria).\n\nIn 1878, he was awarded a posthumous diploma by the Ècole des Beaux-Arts and a major retrospective at the Exposition Universelle. Goupil & Cie also published a large volume of photographs of his major works.\n\n\n"}

At the time of the Civil War the house was the home of Sir Francis Gamul, a Royalist supporter and colonel of the Town Guard. Charles I stayed in the house on 23–24 September 1645, when his army was defeated at the Battle of Rowton Moor.\n\nFollowing the Great Fire of London the town Assembly ruled in 1671 that all the houses in the main streets should have roofs of slate or tile. The medieval frontage of Gamul House was replaced by a brick façade, but the hall was retained. In the 18th century the stone arches in the undercroft were replaced by brick vaults. During the following century this area was occupied by shops. For a time it housed a boarding school but this closed in the 1860s. In the 20th century the house became unoccupied and neglected; when Nikolaus Pevsner visited Chester in the late 1960s he reported that it looked derelict. It was bought by Chester City Council and during the 1970s a major refurbishment took place. As of 2009 the building is occupied by a restaurant and shops.\n\nThe building is constructed in sandstone and timber framing, with a brick frontage and has three storeys. The lowest storey (an undercroft) is occupied by shops. An external staircase parallel to the street has 15 steps leading up to the former row level. Behind the staircase at street level is another shop frontage consisting of a door with a four-light window on each side. The middle storey has a door with an architrave and pediment. There are three windows to the south of the door and two windows to the north, all with 40 panes of glass. Above these is a string course. In the top storey are three oval windows with four panes and two sash windows with six panes. The roof is in grey slate with its ridge parallel to the street; it is hipped at its north end and at the south end is a gable and a chimney stack.\n\nThe undercroft contains a large oak beam and brick barrel vaults. At the row level, the great hall occupies the two storeys. On the west wall of the hall is an ornate sandstone fireplace with decorated pilasters carrying a carved frieze and cornice. On the fireplace is a painting of the arms of the Gamul family, which Pevsner considers was executed by Randle Holme. The barrel-vaulted plaster ceiling has eight richly-carved pendants.\n\nAs of 2009 the Row level is occupied by the Brewery Tap Ale House.\n\n\nCitations\n\nSources\n"}

The company defines itself as an “Inventor for inquisitive minds”, offering a broad selection of products such as wooden and textile toys, home furnishings and accessories for babies and children. Today the company is still a family run company, under the leadership of the managing partner Klaus Habermaaß and the managing director Harald Grosch.\n\nIn 1938, Eugen Habermaaß and Anton Engel founded “Habermaaß & Co.” as a “factory for fine wooden products”, and a couple of months later “Wehrfritz & Co.\" in cooperation with Karl Wehrfritz.\nIn 1940, only two years after its foundation, when Anton Engel withdrew from the company, Eugen Habermaaß became its sole managing director. When he died, in 1955, his wife Luise Habermaaß took over the management of the company. At the same time, their son, Klaus Habermaaß, later to become the managing director of the company, decided to start an apprenticeship in cabinetmaking. On finishing his engineering studies in 1961, he became actively engaged in the running of the company, which grew and expanded in the following years.\n\nThe small manufacturer of wooden toys sets out to become a market leader in the sector, facing up to the challenge of globalization. The toy manufacturer based in Upper Frankonia expands first in the United States where in 1980 the American company “Skaneateles Handicrafters” becomes part of the Habermaaß Inc., first as a production and later as a sales and distribution site. Renamed in the following years as “T.C. Timber”, in 2002 the company receives the definitive company name of “Habermaaß Corp. Inc.\". In the meantime, in 1993, a subsidiary is founded in the French location of Evry near Paris under the name of “HABA S.A.R.L\" and in 2005 the “HABA UK” site is established in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn order to expand their product range even further the corporate family of HABA and Wehrfritz decided back in 1987 to found Jako-o GmbH, a joint mail-order company for children’s fashion, toys and accessories which in 2004 was enlarged with the addition of the sales branches Fit-z and Qiéro.\n\nSince the company was founded in 1938, wooden toys have been a trademark of HABA. The company became known in particular for its construction blocks, which up until now have been an integral part of the product range. Over the decades the product range has expanded: first incorporating other wooden toys such as pulling figures, vehicles, clutching toys and a complex upgradeable ball track system, followed later by the first society games. Which is how in 1986 the most famous HABA game “The Orchard” was created. The connections with the closely related Wehrfritz company were also taken advantage of in the upcoming development and production of children’s furniture –all made in a child friendly way using only the finest woods.\n\nEven today the main focus of the company still lies in manufacturing out of wood. However, progressively different materials have been incorporated: with dolls and fabric animals, rugs, furniture for children’s rooms and illumination articles finding their way into the product range which is further complemented by gift articles, accessories and children’s jewelry. All products made by the Habermaaß company, however, have one shared aim, fostering the healthy development of children.\n\nSince it was founded in 1938, the company’s production site has been located in the Upper Frankonian town of Bad Rodach, just a few kilometers away from the federal state boundary with Thuringia. It is from here that all business and the daily activities of the different branch offices are monitored and directed. The company holds distribution branches in the USA, France and the United Kingdom. Today the company is firmly established in both the European and world markets – with distribution areas stretching from Japan, Russia, the Near East and Europe to North and South America.\n\nAmongst the most prestigious awards that have been conferred on HABA are the Best Children's Game of the Year, the German Children;s Games award, the Toy Innovation Award and the German Educational Game Award.\n\n\nMany HABA playthings have also been designated with the \"Spiel Gut\" ('Good Toy') stamp.\n\n\"Karuba\", one of HABA's strategy board games, was nominated for the 2016 Spiel des Jahres award.\n\n"}

Bonheur focussed on completing \"The Horse Fair\" first, and De Morny attempted to change his mind after its good reception at the Paris Salon in 1853. \n\nThe painting depicts the loading of a hay onto a cart pulled by four oxen.

{"id": "25921922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25921922", "title": "Impossible color", "text": "Impossible color\n\nImpossible colors or forbidden colors are supposed colors that cannot be perceived in normal seeing of light that is a combination of various intensities of the various frequencies of visible light, but are reported to be seen in special circumstances.\n\nThese impossible colors are of two types:\n\nThe color opponent process is a color theory that states that the human visual system interprets information about color by processing signals from cone and rod cells in an antagonistic manner. The three types of cone cells have some overlap in the wavelengths of light to which they respond, so it is more efficient for the visual system to record differences between the responses of cones, rather than each type of cone's individual response. The opponent color theory suggests that there are three opponent channels:\nResponses to one color of an opponent channel are antagonistic to those to the other color, and signals output from a place on the retina can contain one or the other but not both, for each opponent pair.\n\nReal colors are colors that can be produced by a physical light source. Any additive mixture of two real colors is also a real color. When colors are displayed in the CIE 1931 XYZ color space, additive mixture results in a color along the line between the colors being mixed. By mixing any three colors, one can therefore create any color contained in the triangle they describe — this is called the gamut formed by those three colors, which are called primary colors. Any colors outside of this triangle cannot be obtained by mixing the chosen primaries.\n\nWhen defining primaries, the goal is often to leave as many real colors in gamut as possible. Since the region of real colors is not a triangle (see illustration), it is not possible to pick three real colors that span the whole region. The gamut can be increased by selecting more than three real primary colors, but since the region of real colors is not a polygon, there always will be some colors at the edge left out. Therefore, one selects colors outside of the region of real colors as primary colors; in other words, imaginary primary colors. Mathematically, the gamut created in this way contains so-called \"imaginary colors\".\n\nIn computer and television screen color displays, the corners of the gamut triangle are defined by commercially available phosphors chosen to be as near as possible to pure red and pure green and pure blue, and thus are within the area of real colors; note that these color space diagrams inevitably display, instead of real colors outside your computer screen's gamut triangle, the nearest color which is inside the gamut triangle. See page Gamut for more information about the color range available on display devices.\n\nOne type of \"imaginary color\" (also referred to as \"non-physical\" or \"unrealizable color\") is a point in a color space that corresponds to combinations of cone cell responses in one eye, that cannot be produced by the eye in normal circumstances seeing any possible light spectrum. Thus, no object can have an imaginary color. But such imaginary colors are useful as mathematical abstractions for defining color spaces.\n\nThe spectral sensitivity curve of medium-wavelength (\"M\") cone cells overlaps those of short-wavelength (\"S\") and long-wavelength (\"L\") cone cells. Light of any wavelength that interacts with M cones also interacts with S or L cones, or both, to some extent. Therefore, no wavelength (except perhaps a bit of the far red), and no non-negative spectral power distribution, excites only one sort of cone. If, for example, M cones could be excited alone, this would make the brain see an imaginary color greener than any physically possible green; producing it by seeing light would need some of the red and blue parts of visible light to have negative power, which is impossible. Such a \"hyper-green\" color would be in the CIE 1931 color space chromaticity diagram (left image to the right) in the blank area above the colored area and between the \"y\"-axis and the line \"x\"+\"y\"=1.\n\nA \"chimerical color\" is an imaginary color that can be seen temporarily by looking steadily at a strong color for a while until some of the cone cells become fatigued, temporarily changing their color sensitivities, and then looking at a markedly different color. They are explained by the opponent process color theory. For example, staring at a saturated primary-color field and then looking at a white object results in an opposing shift in hue, causing an afterimage of the complementary colors. Exploration of the color space outside the range of \"real colors\" by this means is major corroborating evidence for the opponent process theory of color vision. Chimerical colors can be seen while seeing with one eye or with both eyes, and are not observed to reproduce simultaneously qualities of opposing colors (e.g. \"yellowish blue\"). Chimerical colors include:\n\nUnder normal circumstances, there is no hue that could be described as a mixture of opponent hues; that is, as a hue looking \"redgreen\" or \"yellowblue\".\n\nIn 1983, Hewitt D. Crane and Thomas P. Piantanida performed tests using an eye-tracker device that had a field of a vertical red stripe adjacent to a vertical green stripe, or several narrow alternating red and green stripes (or in some cases, yellow and blue instead). The device could track involuntary movements of one eye (there was a patch over the other eye) and adjust mirrors so the image would follow the eye and the boundaries of the stripes were always on the same places on the eye's retina; the field outside the stripes was blanked with occluders. Under such conditions, the edges between the stripes seemed to disappear (perhaps due to edge-detecting neurons becoming fatigued) and the colors flowed into each other in the brain's visual cortex, overriding the opponency mechanisms and producing not the color expected from mixing paints or from mixing lights on a screen, but new colors entirely, which are not in the CIE 1931 color space, either in its real part or in its imaginary parts. For red-and-green, some saw an even field of the new color; some saw a regular pattern of just-visible green dots and red dots; some saw islands of one color on a background of the other color. Some of the volunteers for the experiment reported that afterwards, they could still imagine the new colors for a period of time.\n\nSome observers indicated that although they were aware that what they were viewing was a color (that is, the field was not achromatic), they were unable to name or describe the color. One of these observers was an artist with a large color vocabulary. Other observers of the novel hues described the first stimulus as a reddish-green.\nIn 2001 Vincent A. Billock and Gerald A. Gleason and Brian H. Tsou set up an experiment to test a theory that the 1983 experiment did not control for variations in the perceived luminance of the colors from subject to subject: two colors are equiluminant for an observer when rapidly alternating between the colors produces the least impression of flickering. The 2001 experiment was similar but controlled for luminance. They had these observations:\n\nSome subjects (4 out of 7) described transparency phenomena—as though the opponent colors originated in two depth planes and could be seen, one through the other. ...\n\nWe found that when colors were equiluminant, subjects saw reddish greens, bluish yellows, or a multistable spatial color exchange (an entirely novel perceptual phenomena ); when the colors were nonequiluminant, subjects saw spurious pattern formation.\nThis led them to propose a \"soft-wired model of cortical color opponency\", in which populations of neurons compete to fire and in which the \"losing\" neurons go completely silent. In this model, eliminating competition by, for instance, inhibiting connections between neural populations can allow mutually exclusive neurons to fire together.\n\nHsieh and Tse in 2006 disputed the existence of colors forbidden by opponency theory and claimed they are, in reality, intermediate colors. See also binocular rivalry.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39621634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39621634", "title": "Léonce Rosenberg", "text": "Léonce Rosenberg\n\nLéonce Rosenberg (12 September 1879 in Paris – 31 July 1947 in Neuilly-sur Seine) was an art historian, art collector, publisher and one of the most influential French art dealers of the 20th century. The son of an antique dealer Alexander Rosenberg and brother of the gallery owner Paul Rosenberg (21 rue de la Boétie, Paris), Léonce, a prominent gallery owner in Paris at the end of World War I, would become one of the world's major dealers of Modern art.\n\nLeaving the family-owned gallery in 1910 Léonce opened his own business called \"Haute Epoque\" at 19 rue de La Baume, Paris. As an antiquarian Rosenberg began buying works by Cubist artists. By 1914 his collection included works by Pablo Picasso, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Auguste Herbin, and Juan Gris. After serving in World War I (1916-1917) he pursued his interests and represented these and other artists, and by the end of the war opened a new show space, .\n\nLéonce Rosenberg studied in London and Antwerp visiting galleries and museums in his free time. After returning to Paris he worked with his brother Paul in the family business. In 1906 Léonce and his brother inherited the family gallery on Avenue de l'Opéra which had been in existence for twenty years. His brother Paul was largely engaged in 19th- and early 20th-century art.\n\nLéonce Rosenberg was an early advocate of Cubism, and would remain so throughout the 1920s and 1930s. He discovered the works of avant-garde artists in 1911 through the Salon des Indépendants, the art dealer Wilhelm Uhde, and in 1912 at the gallery of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler.\nAt the outset of World War I many German nationals living in France had their possessions sequestered by the French state. As a German citizen Kahnweiler took refuge in Switzerland and ran out of funds. With his art collection the hand of the French government he could no longer support his artists. Following the advice of Max Jacob and André Level (known for his well informed art investments), Léonce Rosenberg began amassing his collection. Just before the outbreak of World War I Rosenberg purchased 15 Cubist works by Picasso for 12,000 FF. His collection would soon include 20 works by Picasso, 10 by Georges Braque, 5 by Juan Gris and 20 by Auguste Herbin.\n\nVery quickly and despite his lack of experience Rosenberg became the official dealer of the Cubists purchasing works, in addition to those he already owned, by artist such as Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Fernand Léger, Joseph Csaky, Henry Laurens, Georges Valmier and . Throughout World War I Rosenberg served as a moral and financial supporter of these artists. 'Without him' noted Max Jacob, 'a number of painters would be drivers or factory workers'.\n\nPicasso eventually switched over to his brother Paul Rosenberg's gallery, who would become his dealer Entre Deux Guerres.\n\nRosenberg volunteered for military service in 1915. He moved into a house at rue Marthe Édouard in Meudon near the military base, but also retained his Paris apartment at 22 rue Lavoisier and his Hôtel particulier 19 Rue de la Baume in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. During his periods of leave he continued to purchase Cubist works. From May, 1916, Rosenberg worked outside his unit as an English interpreter at the field headquarters of the Allied forces on the Somme front. During leave at the end of 1916 Rosenberg, through the intermediary of Juan Gris, went to Gino Severini's studio and bought a large painting of Woman Reading; possibly Severini's 1916 \"Femme lisant (Jeanne dans l’atelier; La lecture n. 1)\". The death of Umberto Boccioni during the month of August 1916 marked Severini's rupture from Futurism and his move closer to the Cubists.\n\nIn March 1917, the second line of defense cleared Rosenberg's unit moved to Le Havre. In July of the same year Rosenberg returned to his old unit, now stationed at an airport in Nanterre. Closer to Paris, Rosenberg decided to reopen his gallery.\n\nWith the support given by Léonce Rosenberg, Cubism reemerged as a central issue for artists after four years of war. Rosenberg found himself financially ruined but exhibited the works he owned at his newly opened Galerie de L'Effort Moderne (also known as \"Galerie Léonce Rosenberg\") at 19, rue de la Baume, located in the elegant and fashionable 8th arrondissement of Paris. The gallery was open to all forms of Cubist and Abstract art. What followed would be a series of major one-man exhibitions—including works created between 1914 and 1918 by almost all the major Cubists.\n\nThe first solo exhibition was held in March 1918, featuring works by Auguste Herbin. In December of the same year, Rosenberg launched a series of Cubist exhibitions, beginning with Henri Laurens, followed in January 1919 with an exhibition of Cubist paintings by Jean Metzinger, Fernand Léger in February, Georges Braque in March, Juan Gris April, Gino Severini May, and Pablo Picasso in June, marking the climax of the campaign. This well-orchestrated program showed that Cubism was still very much alive, despite claims by critics to the contrary, and it would remain so for at least a half-decade. Missing from this sequence of exhibitions were Jacques Lipchitz (who would exhibit in 1920), and those who had left France during the Great War: Robert Delaunay and Albert Gleizes most obviously. Nonetheless, according to art historian Christopher Green, \"this was an astonishingly complete demonstration that Cubism had not only continued between 1914 and 1917, having survived the war, but was still developing in 1918 and 1919 in its \"new collective form\" marked by \"intellectual rigor\". In the face of such a display of vigour, it really was difficult to maintain convincingly that Cubism was even close to extinction\".\n\nRosenberg also organized literary and musical events in his gallery.\n\nThe art collections of Kahnweiler and Uhde sequestered at the outset of World War I (which included works by Georges Braque, Raoul Dufy, Juan Gris, Auguste Herbin, Marie Laurencin, Fernand Léger, Jean Metzinger, Pablo Picasso, Jean Puy and Henri Rousseau) were sold by the government in a series of auctions at the Hôtel Drouot in 1921. Rosenberg had himself appointed as 'expert' for the sales.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1927, Rosenberg made his activities known through his \"Bulletin de l'Effort moderne\" (Éditions de l'effort moderne), a publication featuring writings and illustrations by contributors such as Léonce Rosenberg, Albert Gleizes, Piet Mondrian, Gino Severini.\n\nIn 1928 Rosenberg moved his personal collection to his apartment rue de Longchamp, Paris, and commissioned the artists he championed to realize decorative panels. Giorgio de Chirico painted large panels for his living room. After 1928 exhibitions became sporadic, featuring solo exhibitions by de Chirico, Metzinger, and Valmier.\n\nRosenberg commissioned Albert Gleizes (replacing Gino Severini) in 1929 to paint decorative panels for his Parisian residence. They were installed in 1931.\n\nIn 1930 and 1932, the Galerie de L'Effort Moderne presented two large exhibitions of works by Francis Picabia.\n\nA veritable center of activity and interest during the rise of modern art, the Galerie de L'Effort Moderne closed permanently in 1941, as a result of anti-Semitic laws and by the threat of the Nazi occupation of France. Eventually, the Nazi authorities looted some of his collection. The gallery was not reopened following the war due primarily to Rosenberg’s death in July 1947.\n\n\nCrystal Cubism\n\n\n"}
{"id": "51202928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51202928", "title": "Madonna and Child Kissing", "text": "Madonna and Child Kissing\n\nMadonna and Child Kissing is a 1520s oil on panel painting by the Flemish renaissance artist Quentin Matsys in the collection of the Rijksmuseum.\n\nMary, holding two cherries with her right hand, sits kissing her child who sits next to her on a pedastal inside a richly decorated throne with a view of a castle on a river beyond. In the foreground grapes (referring to the wine of the Eucharist) and an apple (symbol of the Fall of Man) lie on a banister. \n\nThere are several known versions of this painting, made popular by a 1628 painting by Willem van Haecht of the \"Gallery of Cornelis van der Geest\". That \"Madonna of the Cherries\" painting was the subject of an anecdote about it which was published in 1648 by Frans Fickaert (1614-1654) in which he stated that on 23 August 1615 while on a visit, the Archduke attempted to buy it from Van der Geest but was refused. He claimed it was in the possession of Van der Geest who declined an offer to purchase it by Albert of Austria. Recent dendrochronology has shown that the wood of the panel was felled at the latest in 1502. Though this panel could have been ready for use by 1513, a date after 1527 is more likely. Fickaert may have been mistaken in the year, or possibly this panel is not the original and was copied by the artist based on the story, or perhaps even because of its featured status in the Haecht painting and the enthusiasm Van der Geest had for Matsys. Van der Geest celebrated the hundredth anniversary of Matsys' death by having his bones re-interred in the Antwerp Cathedral with the inscription \"Connubial bliss turned a blacksmith into Apelles\".\n\nThis painting was in the collection of Albertina Agnes (1634-1696), Princess of Oranje-Nassau, at the Frisian Stadholder’s Court, Leeuwarden, and a century later was appropriated for the national collection from Paleis Het Loo to the museum then in The Hague, 18 September 1798. The appropriation of art from the stadtholder's collection was a tactical move to prevent the abduction of more national treasure to Paris as had happened with the Gallery Prince William V in 1795. The painting has been in the national collection owned by the Rijksmuseum ever since. Since 1948 it has been on loan to the Mauritshuis.\n\nOther known versions:\n\n"}
{"id": "11662841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11662841", "title": "Marathi cinema", "text": "Marathi cinema\n\nMarathi cinema refers to Indian films produced in Marathi, the language of the state of Maharashtra, India. Based in old Mumbai, it is the oldest and one of the pioneer film industries of India. The first Marathi film to be released in India was \"Shree Pundalik\" by Dadasaheb Torne on 18 May 1912 at Coronation Cinematograph, Mumbai. and a Marathi crew who were performing Marathi and Sanskrit \"Sangeet natika\"s (musicals) and plays in Marathi at that period. The first Marathi talkie film, \"Ayodhyecha Raja\", was released in 1932, just one year after \"Alam Ara\" the first Hindi talkie. Although the industry is much smaller than the large market driven Hindi cinema based in Mumbai, Marathi cinema is tax free, and is experiencing growth in recent years. \"Raja Harishchandra\", directed by Dadasaheb Phalke, was a Marathi film, now known as India's first full-length feature, released in 1913. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award is India's highest award in cinema given annually by the Government of Maharashtra for lifetime contribution to Indian cinema.\n\nMarathi cinema is the oldest form of Indian cinema. The first Marathi movie released in India was \"Shree Pundalik\" by Dadasaheb Torne on 18 May 1912 at Coronation Cinematograph, Mumbai.\n\nDadasaheb Phalke is known as the first pioneer and founder of cinema in pre-Independence India. He brought the revolution of moving images to India with his first indigenously made film \"Raja Harishchandra\" in 1913, which is considered by IFFI and NIFD as part of Marathi cinema as it was made by a Marathi dialogues while shooting and fully Marathi crew. Kolhapur in Western Maharashtra was another centre of active film production in the twenties. In 1919 Baburao Mistry — popularly known as Baburao Painter — formed the Maharashtra Film Company with the blessings of the Maharaja of Kolhapur and released the first significant historical \"Sairandhari \"(1920) with Balasheb Pawar, Kamala Devi and Zunzarrao Pawar in stellar roles. Because of his special interest in sets, costumes, design and painting, he chose episodes from Maratha history for interpreting in the new medium and specialised in the historical genre. Baburao Painter made many silent movies till 1930. However, after a few more silent films, the Maharashtra Film Company pulled down its shutters with the advent of sound. Baburao was not particularly keen on the talkies for he believed that they would destroy the visual culture so painfully evolved over the years.\n\nAs cinema grew in Union of India, major production houses rose and one of them was again a company owned wholly by Maharashtrians, the Prabhat Film Company. Prabhat's \"Sant Tukaram\" was the first Indian work to win the Best Film Award at the Venice film festival in 1937.\nIn 1954 at the very first edition of the National Awards, \"Shyamchi Aai\" another Marathi film, won the first President's Gold Medal for Cinema. It was directed by Acharya P K Atre, and it was an adaptation of the eponymous novel by Sane Guruji.\n\nMarathi cinema was in its full bloom by this time with the advent of greats like V. Shantaram, Master Vinayak, Bhalji Pendharkar, Acharya Atre, followed by Raja Paranjpe, Jyotiram,sonal and mumtaz, Dinkar D Patil, G. D. Madgulkar, Sudhir Phadke , Raja Thakur . The 1960s saw the emergence of directors like Anant Mane who made Marathi films based on the folk art form Tamasha. Then came directors like Datta Dharmadhikari and Raj Dutt who made traditional family dramas. The early 70s saw the advent of Dada Kondke who captured the audiences with his sense of humour. He went on to create satirical, pun-ridden films often including social and political commentary, many of which became cult classics. By this time Marathi cinema was caught in either the Tamasha genre or tragedies revolving around traditional family dramas on one side and the comedies of Dada Kondke.\n\nThe 1980s saw two comedy heroes catapult to stardom, Ashok Saraf and Laxmikant Berde. Around the mid-80s two young actors donned the director's mantle: Mahesh Kothare and Sachin Pilgaonkar. Pilgaonkar directed \"Navri Mile Navryala\" and around the same time Mahesh Kothare directed \"Dhumdhadaka\". Pilgaonkar's film was a box-office hit while Mahesh Kothare's became a mega hit at the box-office, became a trend-setter, and brought young audiences to Marathi cinema. Mahesh Kothare went on to make comedy films that became major hits. He made the first Marathi film shot on the anamorphic format (Cinemascope) — \"Dhadakebaaz\". He brought a number of innovations in the technical quality of Marathi films and was the first to bring Dolby Digital sound to Marathi cinema with \"Chimni Pakhara\". He made the first Marathi film with Digital Special Effects, \"Pachadlela\", in 2004. He also made first Marathi movie in 3D \"Zapatlela 2\", in 2013. The 3D of this film was highly appreciated and technically this film was extremely well made. This film also went on to become a blockbuster. Currently Mahesh Kothare is working on Zapatlela 3. This for the first time that a franchise has emerged in Marathi cinema.\n\nWhile the theatre of Maharashtra earned recognition at the national level, the cinema failed to make a mark. A major reason was the proximity to the production centre of Hindi cinema (Bollywood), which encroached on the identity of Marathi cinema. Other reasons include the shortage of cinema halls for distribution due to poor marketing, lack of money magnets, a vibrant theatre scene and the emergence of private television. It also lacked the powerful lobby at the national level unlike Bengali and South Indian cinema because state congress (ruling party over 40 years) encouraged Hindi cinema for profit mainly; the regional film industrial advantage being soaked up by Bollywood.\n\nIn past few years, the Marathi cinema industry has produced many films that are not only critically acclaimed but commercially successful as well. It has brought fresh ideas, untouched subjects and deeper human sensitivity on the celluloid.\n\nAcclaimed director Dr Jabbar Patel explains the reasons behind the change, \"The kind of Marathi cinema that is being made today is very fresh and different. This is thanks to directors and writers getting exposed to world cinema via television, film festivals etc. They are coming up with new storylines and innovative concepts.\"\n\nActor Mrinal Kulkarni remarks, \"There is a lot of content and variety in Marathi films. A lot of bold subjects have been handled well by them. They carry a lot of substance.\" But, she adds, \"We need to start watching a lot more Marathi films. Until we see the films ourselves, we will never be able to appreciate them when they are sent to the Oscars.\"\n\nWith outstanding contribution and efforts from different producers and directors of the Mumbai film industry, Marathi cinema relatively outshined other Indian film industries such as Bollywood in the first quarter of 2010 in box office collections and critical appreciation.\n\nMarathi cinema received critical acclaim in 2004 with the film \"Shwaas\" winning the Golden Lotus National Award. It was India's official entry to the 77th Academy Awards. It won the President's medal for best film, beating Bollywood's prolific output with quality. \"Shwaas\" was the second Marathi film to win the President's Medal after \"Shyamchi Aai\" (1950).\n\nThe Maharashtra state government has begun to issue grants to Marathi film (between 1.5 million and 3.0 million rupees). After the success of \"Shwaas\", Indian media players like Shringar Films and Zee Telefilms are exhibiting a re-emerging interest in Marathi cinema. The growing popularity of Marathi television (notably Zee Marathi and ETV Marathi) has helped to popularize older Marathi cinema and promote the genre. Zee Talkies, a 24-hour channel dedicated to Marathi movies, has been introduced.\n\nIn 2009, Marathi film \"Harishchandrachi Factory\" (with a budget of Rs. 6 crore), depicting the struggle of Dadasaheb Phalke in making \"Raja Harishchandra\" in 1913, India's first feature film, directed by theatre-veteran Paresh Mokashi was selected as India's official entry to Academy Award in the Best Foreign Language Film category, making it the second Marathi film, after \"Shwaas\", to receive this honour.\n\n2009 saw the blockbuster musical movie \"Natarang\", which both commercial and critical applause and has served as a path-breaking movie for Marathi cinema.\n\nSince the new decade beginning in 2010, several contemporary Marathi artistic films released including Umesh Vinayak Kulkarni's \"Vihir\" and \"Deool\", and Nagraj Manjule's \"Fandry\". They have given a new direction to Marathi films.\n\nDeool became the third movie after Shyaamchi Aai and Shwaas to win the National Film Award for Best Feature Film\n\nSairat (2016) musical romantic drama starring Rinku Rajguru and Akash Thosar, directed by Nagraj Manjule and produced by Nagraj Manjule, Nitin Keni, and Nikhil Sane emerged as the biggest weekend opener for a Marathi film breaking record previously held by Natsamrat. Sairat was the first Marathi film to cross ₹50 crore (US$7.8 million) mark. The film has become the first Marathi film to gross over ₹100 crore (US$16 million) worldwide. Also it ran for more than 100 days in many centres of Maharashtra.\n\nNowadays Marathi movies have been listed at lots of International Film Festival and All lights Film Services, which provides a platform for such movies and the film makers to know big in the world film industry.All Lights Film Services provided platform for various famous Marathi Films such as PINKY – Ek Sathyakatha, Kapus Kondyachi Goshta,Hou De Jarasa Ushir, Sopanchi Aye Bahina Bhai,Touring Talkies,Langar to almost all leading International Festivals across the world including Oscar.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a valuable guide on a quasi scientific basis for the manufacturers of perfumery, for it is only necessary to strike a chord on the piano, and to know what odors the respective notes of the chord represent, to arrive at the suggestion for some new bouquet.\" Hartmann was skeptical of the value of the perfume organ for \"asthetical\" experiments, as \"the affinity between sounds and odors is purely speculative\".\n\nIn 1922, the magazine \"Science and Invention\" had an article on a new, silent take on the perfume organ. Instead of attempting harmony of music and scent, the keys on the keyboard of the \"Science and Invention\" version played only notes of perfume.

It is one of the oldest theatres in the country, and it has remained a major musical centre during its history, in which many significant art events have taken place. Its ballet troupe is one of the most popular in Russia.\n\nThe theatre is often named \"Tchaikovsky's House\", and all stage works of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, who was born in the region, are presented in its repertoire: 10 operas and 3 ballets. Festivals of Tchaikovsky's works were notable cultural events of the country.\n\nThe theatre was inaugurated on 24 November 1870 with the premiere performance being Mikhail Glinka's \"A Life for the Tsar\". The building was constructed from 1874 to 1879, after which the first performance took place in the winter of 1879/1880. At the time, the general manager was the later famous entrepreneur P.P. Medvedev.\n\nA new epoch in the history of the theatre started in 1896. It received the patronage of the city parliament, which decided to finance the theatre and the opera troupe from the city budget. A board of directors was elected for managing the theatre and inviting the artists. \"Aida\" was the first presentation with the assistance of the city.\n\nThe first season after the end of the Civil War opened on 20 August 1921. Among the performances were \"Demon\", \"Faust\", \"Aida\", \"Eugine Onegin\", \"Boris Godunov\", \"Rigoletto\", \"Il Barbiere di Sevilla\". Perm had become one of the major operatic centers of Russia by the end of the 1920s.\n\nDuring World War II, when the Leningrad State Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet evacuated its personnel to the city, its performances were given in the Perm theatre. The artists from Leningrad had worked in Perm for three winters and two summers.\n\nIn 1956, the Perm theatre was renamed in honor of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and given Academy status in 1969.\n\nThe theatre was awarded the National Glinka Award for the performance of Sergei Prokofiev's \"War and Peace\" in 1984. Also, the artists of the theatre have got the Golden Mask Award for many performances:\n\n\nMany opera premieres in Russia were given in this theatre: Edison Denisov's \"The Foam of Days\", Jules Massenet's \"Cléopâtre\", Claudio Monteverdi's \"L'Orfeo\", George Frideric Handel's \"Alcina\", Antonín Dvořák's \"Rusalka\", Rodion Shchedrin's \"Lolita\", Anton Rubinstein's \"Christ\", Alexander Tchaikovsky's \"One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich\". Five operas based on Pushkin's works were presented during the 200th anniversary year of the poet.\n\nThe theatre held the first festival in the 20th Century of the Russian composer Sergei Prokofiev's work, where it opened with a two-evening version of the opera \"War and Peace\" and gave stage life to the opera \"The Fiery Angel\".\n\nThere is a good tradition of collaboration with directors and choreographers from Germany, United States, Spain, and Switzerland on the Perm stage. Due to long-term projects between Russia and United States in collaboration with The George Balanchine Foundation and The Jerome Robbins Foundation, the repertoire of the theatre gets many masterpieces of the most distinguished choreographers of the 20th Century.\n\nFor many decades the theatre has been the launch site for many artists who are famous far away from Russia. Many stars of Moscow and Saint Petersburg theatres and other famous theatres of the world have begun their careers in the Perm theatre. Among those artists are: Galina Ragozina-Panova, Lubov Kunakova, Nadegda Pavlova, Olga Chenchikova, Marat Daukaev, Yuri Petuhov, Galina Shalyapina, Svetlana Smirnova, and Monica Loughman.\n\nArabesque is a ballet competition headed by Vladimir Vasiliev which has taken place in Perm since 1990. More than 650 young ballet artists from Russia, former republics of the USSR, Austria, Argentina, Bulgaria, Belarus, China, Croatia, Egypt, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Mongolia, Slovenia, South Korea, Turkey, United States and Venezuela have participated in it.\n\nInternational festivals known as the \"Diaghilev Seasons: Perm-Petersburg-Paris\" have become some of the most visible events in the cultural life of Russia. The festival has taken place in the theatre every two years since 2003. Georgy Isaakyan was an art director of the festival until 2010, but the new art director of the theatre Teodor Currentzis will replace him on this position.\n\nThe ballet troupe successfully performs abroad under the name of The Tchaikovsky Ballet. Promotion of the opera troupe in the United States began with a performance of \"Mazeppa\" in Carnegie Hall in January 2008 using the name The Tchaikovsky Theatre.\n\nThere were many concert tours in Saint Petersburg and Moscow which always drew a wide response. The artists of the Perm Theatre have participated in many festivals, such as White Nights Festival on the stage of Mariinsky Theatre, Baltic Seasons in Kaliningrad, Panorama of Musical Theatres in Omsk and Crescendo on the stage of Bolshoi Theatre.\n\nThe famous pilot Valery Chkalov visited Perm in February 1937 and went to a performance of \"Eugene Onegin\". The singer in the role of Tatyana bent forward towards a candle, and her wig caught fire. Then Chkalov, who was sitting in a side directorial box, jumped out onto the stage, plucked the wig from the actress, and extinguished it. Chkalov wrote in the guest book after the end of the performance: \"Wonderful performance. Good voices. Excellent choir… I wish the delightful team of the theatre every success in subsequent work!\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "58858146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58858146", "title": "Robert Henri Museum", "text": "Robert Henri Museum\n\nThe Robert Henri Museum is located in Cozad, Nebraska in a building that was once the home of Robert Henri (previously Robert Henry Cozad), a prominent figure of the Ashcan School of art and one of “The Eight”. The Robert Henri Museum houses works by Robert Henri, including sketches, drawings, and paintings by the artist.\n\nThe museum is designated a non-profit educational 501(c)(3) organization and located at 218 East 8 Street in Cozad, Nebraska.  It also houses items related to the history of Cozad, founded by Robert Henri's father John Jackson Cozad. This includes furnishings and other items owned by the Cozad family.  The museum lists its mission as “[T]o preserve the boyhood home of Robert Henri (Robert Henry Cozad) for public education and enjoyment, as well as to increase the general understanding of the appreciation of the arts.”\n\nThe museum was founded by a coalition of women of Cozad who saw an opportunity to honor both the history of the area and one of its more prominent former citizens.  The coalition purchased the home, then known as the Hendee Hotel. The group was led by Shirley Paulsen. Also included in the purchase was an adjacent historical walkway and original Pony Express Station, an historical church, and schoolhouse.  The purchase was made with both local support and donations from the family of Robert Henri and the Cozad family.  At that time, additional repairs and improvements were made to the building. Museum quality climate control and security was added in 2014, to safely maintain the art collection.\n\nThe growing art collection contains art by Robert Henri including “Mariana of Austria, Queen of Spain.” It was donated by Janet LeClair in 1988.  Currently, the gallery displays more than 33 drawings, seven paintings, and assorted other items belonging to the artist. A 2017 addition to the collection was “Normandie Interior”, which was completed in 1897.  The painting was part of Henri’s first solo exhibition and bought by Frank Southern, the artist’s brother, and kept in the family for the next 120 years.\n\nThe original house was built by John Jackson Cozad, the father of Robert Henri and the founder of the city of Cozad, Nebraska.  The house was occupied by the Cozad family between 1873 and 1883.  It has what some have called a checkered history, because in 1883, John Cozad shot a local rancher named Alfred Pearson.  This dispute is said to have originated when Mr. Pearson’s cattle herd strayed onto John J. Cozard’s fields, ruining the crops. John J. Cozad attempted to bring the matter before the courts and was awaiting a court date to resolve the incident. However, the dispute erupted into violence when the two encountered one another at Julia Gatewood’s general store, a local gathering place for card players where Mr. Cozad was known to frequent to play faro, a card game of the period.  The two became involved in a shouting match, with Mr. Cozad insisting that Mr. Pearson not speak that way in front of Mr. Gatewood.  Mr. Pearson attempted to leave and continue the dispute, but insults were exchanged and a fist fight occurred.  Mr. Cozad took the matter a bit further and pulled a gun and shot Mr. Person, who died a month later.  \n\nJohn Cozad returned home and fled to Denver that night, and his wife and sons were left to sell the home and reunite in Denver.  His parents took the names Richard and Tessa Lee, and his brother the name Frank Southern to escape the notoriety of the resulting murder charge.  Robert Henry Cozad, remained in Denver for a time, but eventually went on the New York to study art.  After a trip to Paris, he took the name Robert Henri.  The story is recounted in “Son of a Gambling Man” by Mari Sandoz.\n\nAnother infamous artist also lived in the home.  This was also the home of Miles Maryott, a near contemporary of Henri’s, described by the Omaha World Herald as “a well-known hunting guide, outdoorsman and landscape painter — there was talk he would become the first-ever Nebraska state naturalist — before he pulled a gun on his best friend and changed his own life.”  His fame thereafter was as a jailhouse artist of some talent.\n\nJohn Jackson Cozad, the original owner of the house and the father of Robert Henri, was born in 1830. When his mother died and his father remarried, he found living in the family home difficult and left it at the age of 12.  While working on steamboats for the next few years, he learned a card game popular that the time called faro.  He eventually joined the ranks of professional gamblers working the Mississippi and Ohio riverboats and other gambling establishments.  \n\nHe met and married Theresa Gatewood.  She was a daughter of a hotel owner from Malden, Virginia.  Once they married, they settled in Cincinnati where they had six children, only two of which survived into adulthood. While working his way around the gambling circuit in 1872, John Cozad won $50,000, a huge sum at the time.  \n\nJohn J. had the dream of founding a town that would carry his name.  First founding the town of Cozaddale, Ohio in 1871, and then the town of Cozad, Nebraska in 1872.  He placed advertising in several eastern newspapers encouraging people to move to this new town.  When people accepted his offer and moved west, he often found ways to employ them when the town hit hard times. Two such projects were a bridge building company and a haying operation.\n\nThe museum sponsors an artist-in-residence program. As of June of 2016, the artist-in-residence was Fred Cowie.  Dr. Cowie, a self-trained artist, received a doctorate in history.  He counts among his influences the art of Paul Cezanne, Rembrandt van Rijn and Claude Monet.  Both a painter and a jewelry artist, he practices his art on a daily basis by creating small paintings.\n"}

In 1903, the Dallas office sprung from a new partnership called Sanguinet, Staats and Hill, which operated for two years under that name until Charles D. Hill left the firm. In 1922, architect Wyatt C. Hedrick joined and it became Sanguinet, Staats, and Hedrick. In turn, this firm added R.D.

The food court holds 539 stalls, and the second floor serves as a parking lot for 400 cars.\n\nIn addition to the food court, side streets and alleys are lined with storefronts and roadside stands. Cinemas, video arcades, and karaoke bars are also prevalent in the area. Like most night markets in Taiwan, the local businesses and vendors begin opening around 16:00. As students begin returning home from school, crowds reach their peak between 20:00 and 23:00. Businesses continue operating well past midnight, closing around 01:00 or 02:00.\n\nTourist traffic has increased in recent years due to the opening of the Taipei Metro system. The night market is closest to Jiantan Station on Tamsui–Xinyi line (Tamsui/Red Line), and can be seen from the station platform.\n\nThe night market is located near the former location of a wharf on the Keelung River. Agricultural produce from farms in Shilin being shipped to other ports such as Banka and Dadaocheng would typically be sold in this area. The daytime Shilin Market was formally established in this area in 1909, and the market was inaugurated in 1913. With the influx of customers, many new businesses and food vendors began to establish themselves in the area and the Shilin Night Market was born.\n\nShilin Night Market has since become the largest and most well-known night market in Taiwan, especially with regards to food, and is a favorite focal point for Taipei's night life among residents and visitors alike.\n\nDue to safety, sanitation and fire hazard concerns, the old Shilin Market structure was demolished in October 2002 by the Taipei City Government; the food vendors formerly based within the old structure were relocated to a newer temporary structure a few hundred meters away, next to the metro Jiantan Station. Plans for the renovated site began in 1999 work began in 2006 after the relocation of the vendors to the temporary site. The renovated site re-opened in 2011.\n\nShilin Night Market is accessible via the Tamsui–Xinyi line (Taipei Metro) at Jiantan Station. A number of bus routes also serve the area with stops at Jiantan Station, nearby Ming Chuan University, and Xiao Bei (Hsiao Pei) Street.\n\n\n\n"}

Every year, the program accepts online applications from emerging artists from November through January, and selects 65 to participate in the nine-week intensive summer program. Admissions decisions are announced in April. The School provides participants with housing, food, and studio space, and the campus offers a library, media lab, and sculpture shop, among other amenities. The tuition for the program is $6,000, however aid is available, ensuring that everyone accepted into the program can attend, regardless of financial need.\n\nWhile on campus, the participants interact with five or six resident faculty artists for the duration of the program, as well as five to seven visiting faculty artists, both of whom are selected by Skowhegan’s Board of Governors. Participants are not allowed to bring family or friends with them to Skowhegan, nor are visitors allowed on campus. Lectures by faculty artists, which are generally held on Fridays, are open to the public.\n\nDuring World War II, New England portrait painter Willard C. Cummings was stationed in Alaska in the Army Art Unit. There, he shared his idea for an educational model “where young artists could study with leading artists of the time” with Sidney Simon, a sculptor also in the Unit. Upon returning from the War in 1946, with the help of Simon, Henry Varnum Poor, already an established presence in American Art, and Charles Cutler, a New England stone sculptor, Cummings turned his family farm into a functional alternative school run by artists for artists.\n\nThe School, as the name indicates, was originally focused on the traditional art forms of painting and sculpture, but gradually, the program began accepting artists of all practices, even being the alleged site of the first contemporary Land Art piece in 1968 by Douglas Leichter and Richard Saba.\n\nSimilarly, while The School originally offered classes such as life drawing or plein air painting, the school eventually forewent traditional forms of instruction save for weekly faculty lectures, and all classes on campus are now self-directed by participants. Fresco instruction, however, has always been a part of the program. Today, The School is unique in that it is one of the few institutions in the United States that teaches this technique. Since 2010, N. Sean Glover has been the fresco instructor.\n\nSince 1952, The School has recorded the lectures given on campus by resident and visiting faculty artists.

Our members come together via nine chapters across Canada to advocate for the advancement of the design profession.\n\nGDC was Canada’s first distinct group to professionalize graphic design as a distinct field.\n\nIn 1956 a visionary group of designers [Frank Davies, John Gibson, Frank Newfeld, and Leslie (Sam) Smart] met in Toronto to form the Society of Typographic Designers of Canada (TDC).\n\nDue to the rapid evolution of the profession, in 1968 the organization changed its name to the Society of Graphic Designers of Canada (GDC). Thanks to the efforts of a number of dedicated designers and design educators, negotiations between members of the original society, the federal government, and designers from every region of the country culminated in the granting of a Federal Charter in 1976, unifying the country under one national association.\n\nIn 1996 GDC’s five Ontario Chapters amalgamated to form the Association of Registered Graphic Designers of Ontario and received provincial legislation granting them authority to use the title of Registered Graphic Designer and the R.G.D. designation within the province of Ontario.\n\nGDC celebrated its 50th Anniversary in 2006 with a commemorative stamp from Canada Post.\n\nToday GDC has chapters throughout Canada and proudly boasts representation in every province and territory as well as many international members.\n\nGDC is well-respected internationally.

{"id": "40441584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40441584", "title": "Soul Doctor", "text": "Soul Doctor\n\nSoul Doctor \"- Journey of a Rockstar Rabbi\" is a Broadway musical that details the life of Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach, with music and lyrics by Shlomo Carlebach and David Schechter, and book and direction by Daniel Wise. The Soul Doctor show debuted at Le Petit Theatre du Vieux Carre in New Orleans, and had subsequent runs at The Colony Theater in Miami, The Parker Playhouse in Ft Lauderdale, and The New York Theatre Workshop in New York City. The Broadway production started previews in July 2013 with its official opening night taking place August 15, 2013 at Broadway's Circle in the Square Theatre.\n\nThis coming of age story of courage and inspiring perseverance opens in 1960s Vienna, where Shlomo Carlebach is giving a concert, having returned to the city for the first time in decades, and then transitions back in time to Nazi-occupied Austria when Shlomo, as a child, witnessed the murder of a Jewish man singing in the streets. This experience causes Shlomo to make a pledge to always stand up for freedom of expression through music. To escape persecution, the Carlebach family moves to the Upper West Side in New York City where Shlomo is a Yeshiva student studying the Talmud and memorizing the Torah, following his father's footsteps to become a Rabbi.\n\nShlomo's path soon changes when he meets the legendary jazz singer Nina Simone in a Greenwich Village night club. She not only teaches him about her gospel and jazz musical roots, but also confesses how her people, like Jews in Europe at the time, were being persecuted in the U.S. Inspired by the music of Simone, Shlomo begins to break Orthodox tradition by obtaining a guitar. He is soon writing songs and playing his music for women and non-Jews in clubs around New York City. Shlomo embraces pop music and hippiedom over established scholasticism despite ramifications within his family. In the late '60s he moved to Haight-Ashbury in San Francisco where a \"House of Love and Prayer\" becomes his home with a following that keeps growing.

Erica Ash is equally superb as Simone, whether quietly conveying the singer's fierce dignity or delivering stunning versions of signature classics such as \"Sinnerman.\" Jason Zinoman also praised Anderson's performance in \"The New York Times\", writing: \"Transforming from a mild-mannered rabbi into a kinetic dynamo, Anderson imbues his numbers with their own arc, often starting in a meditative mood before slowly building to a joyous, leaping roar.\"\n\nFollowing its 2013 opening on Broadway, the Soul Doctor show was reviewed by \"The New York Times\", \"Associated Press\", \"The Hollywood Reporter\", and \"Newsday\", all of whom applauded Anderson's performance as Carlebach while comparing the show to \"Fiddler on the Roof\" and \"Hair\", and giving overall mixed to positive reviews of the musical.\n\n"}
{"id": "24951497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24951497", "title": "The Expulsion of the Déisi", "text": "The Expulsion of the Déisi\n\nThe Expulsion of the Déisi is a medieval Irish narrative of the Cycles of the Kings. It dates approximately to the 8th century, but survives only in manuscripts of a much later date. It describes the fictional history of the Déisi, a group that had gained political power in parts of Ireland during the Early Middle Ages. Part of the text's purpose is to provide the kings of the Déisi – historically the descendants of unlanded vassals to other tribes – with a mythical noble origin as the heirs to a dynasty expelled from Tara.\n\nThe story survives in two different Old Irish versions, which contain essentially the same narrative supplemented by singular additions, including tangential episodes, lists of names, and poetry. After violently recovering his niece from the depredations of the king's son of Tara, Óengus Gaíbúaibthech and his followers are dispossessed by the king and sent to wander Ireland. They tarry in Leinster for a period, but are eventually expelled from that kingdom as well. When military prowess fails them, they are able to forge a home for themselves through cunning and magic in Munster against the Osraige. As with much early Irish literature, the digressive onomastic and genealogical material is of great value. In particular, one passage describes a Déisi branch settling in Britain and founding the Kingdom of Dyfed, a matter of some interest in the context of early Irish migrations to Britain.\n\nThe story survives in an earlier and a later version, which Kuno Meyer dubbed \"A\" and \"B\". The A version dates to the 8th century, but exists only in manuscripts of a significantly later date. It survives complete in Laud MS 610 and Rawlinson MS 502, and in fragmentary form in the Book of Uí Maine and the Liber Flavus Fergusiorum. Of the complete copies, Meyer notes that the Rawlinson text contains fewer errors, but that Laud preserves more archaic spelling. The B version survives in some form in three manuscripts. The oldest of these is a fragment contained in the Book of the Dun Cow; this copy is complemented by the later two, found in H. 3. 17 and H. 2. 5, allowing for reconstruction of the text. The H. 2. 5 copy further contains several poems absent from the other manuscripts.\n\nThe title is recorded variously in the manuscripts. Rawlinson contains \"Tairired na n'Déssi\", or \"The Journeying of the Déisi.\" Laud records it as \"De causis torche n'Déssi\"/\"acuis toirge na n'Déssi\". The word \"torche/toirge\" is obscure, but Meyer associates it with \"expedition\". The B manuscripts all contain some reference to the injury visited upon Cormac mac Airt, one of the characters: the Book of the Dun Cow has \"Tucait innarba na n'Dési im Mumain & aided Cormaic\", H. 3. 17 has \"Cóechad Cormaic i Temraig\", and H. 2. 5 has \"Tucaid cháetcha Cormaic do Aengus Gaibuaibtheach & aigeag Ceallaig & fotha indarbtha na nDeissi do Muig Breag\". Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville's \"Catalogue\" further lists two possibly related titles: \"Longes Eithne Uathaige\" and \"Tochomlad na nDési a Temraig\". However, it is unknown to which version, if either, these refer.\n\nThe term \"Déisi\" initially designated various subject peoples owing tribute to landowning tribes. It derives from the Old Irish \"déis\", meaning \"client(s)\" or \"vassalry\"; this distinguishes it from other Irish ethonyms that derive from ancestors' personal names. \"The Expulsion of the Déisi\" concerns one such group, the Déisi Muman of Munster, who lived primarily in the present-day counties of Waterford and Tipperary and were subject to the Eóganachta dynasty. Over time, the Déisi Muman grew in power, and were prominent enough to found their own local kingdom at a fairly early date. The various groups designated \"Déisi\" were not originally closely related, but by the mid-8th century, following the rise of the Déisi Muman, they came to be seen as a genealogically linked whole, descended from the same noble ancestors. \"The Explulsion of the Déisi\" gives a mythical origin narrative for the then powerful Déisi Muman and associated groups.\n\n\"The Expulsion of the Déisi\" was long considered a more or less historically accurate account of a mass displacement of the Déisi and their subsequent settlement on the southwestern coast of Ireland and elsewhere. This was later disputed by scholars such as John MacNeill, Patrick C. Power, T. F. O'Rahilly, and Séamus Pender, who regard it as late fiction.\n\nBoth versions describe the adventures of the Déisi forefathers in the time of Cormac mac Airt, King of Tara. They follow the same narrative track, but both contain sections that break from the main narrative and tell individual, largely unrelated stories about the Déisi and their contemporaries. A contains episodes not in B, and vice versa.\n\nIn the A version, the Déisi are led by the four sons of Artchorp: Brecc, Óengus Gaíbúaibthech (Óengus of the Dread Spear), Eochaid Allmuir (Eochaid the Foreigner), and Forad. Forad's daughter Forach is raped and kidnapped by Conn (elsewhere Cellach), the \"wanton son\" of Cormac maic Airt. Óengus, who leads a band of fifty men, goes to Tara to rescue her. When Conn refuses to release the girl, Óengus runs him through with his \"dread spear\", which blinds Cormac in one eye in the process. Because the law forbids a high king to have a physical blemish, Cormac must retire to a ráth outside Tara, and defer the kingship to his son Cairbre Lifechair. Undeterred, Cormac raises his forces against the Déisi and expels them from Tara. Óengus, together with his brother Brecc's sons Russ and Eogan, engages the king in seven battles. After forty days Óengus succeeds Brecc as king of the Déisi, but steps down due to \"murmurs\" about his consolidation of the power of both champion and king. Cormac will not give the Déisi a fair fight, and pushes them into Leinster, where the local ruler Fiachu Bacceda drives the Uí Bairrche from their land and gives it to the Déisi. They remain there for three decades.\n\nEventually the Uí Bairrche warrior Eochu Guinech ejects the Déisi and they are compelled to move further south into Ard Ladrann, thereafter known as the \"Land of the Wandering Host\". Section 8 tells the story of Ethne the Dread, daughter of then King of Leinster Crimthann mac Énnai (d. 483) and an eventual fosterling of the Déisi. At her birth a druid prophesies that under Ethne her mother's kindred will seize what will be their homeland; hearing this her parents feed her the flesh of young boys to accelerate her growth. Meanwhile, Cormac continues to harass Óengus and the Déisi, stirring up discord among their warriors and leaders. He sends a peace offer to Russ and Eogan, the sons of Brecc, offering them absolution and land if they return to his service. Óengus promises them yet more land and preeminence over his children for them to remain.\n\nWhen Crimthann mac Énnai dies, his sons turn on the Déisi, driving them out of Leinster altogether. They settle briefly in Osraige, but the king burns down their houses, leaving them homeless and forced to wander west into Munster. They receive some relief when Óengus mac Nad Froích (d. 489), King of Munster, proposes to marry Ethne the Dread, who has been traveling with the Déisi. He offers to grant her any three demands as the dowry. Ethne requests land for her mother's kindred, fulfilling her prophecy; she also requests that Osraige be cleared of its inhabitants and given to the Déisi, and that her people be as free as the \"three Eoganacht of Munster\". Óengus grants her wishes, but the Déisi are unable to oust the residents of Osraige. With the help of Lugaid Laigde Cosc, the seer-judge of the Corcu Loígde and Cashel, they devise a trick: learning of a prophecy that whichever side draws first blood the next day will be routed, the Déisi druids transform one of their men into a red cow. The men of Osraige kill the cow, thereby sealing their fate; they are pushed across the Lingaun River, which thereafter serves as the border between the Déisi and Osraige. The Déisi divide up their land, and most of the remainder of the text lists names of individual Déisi and septs descended from them.\n\nThe B version contains the same basic narrative, with significant additions and subtractions. It was edited (Irish only) by Meyer in \"Anecdd.\" I, with TCD MS 1316 (olim H. 2.15a), pp. 67a-68b (\"H\" text) as base, with footnoted readings from MS 1336 (olim H. 3.17), col. 720b-723a (\"h\" text).\n\nIt likewise begins with the kidnapping of Forach by Cormac's son (here Cellach), but in this version Óengus is initially too busy avenging family insults with his famous spear to save her. It is only after he is rebuked for his dithering by a woman – whom he kills – that he rescues Forach, killing Cellach and blinding Cormac in the process. The story continues with the Déisi's expulsion from Tara, their sojourn in Leinster, and their patriation in Munster following the marriage arrangement between Ethne the Dread and Óengus mac Nad Froích. Here, however, aid in exploiting the prophecy that ultimately allows them to displace the men of Osraige comes not from a seer-judge, but from the \"haughty daughter\" of the Osraige druid who delivers the prognostication.\n\nOf the material not in the A version, by far the most substantial is in a lengthy tangential episode dealing with the birth and childhood of Óengus' foster son Corc Duibne, progenitor of the Corcu Duibne, whose name is merely mentioned in A. Corc and his brother are born of incest to Coirpre Múse and Duihind, children of the king of Munster Conaire Cóem, and their nativity brings famine to the land. The people want them immolated, but Corc is saved by a druid and his wife who take him to an offshore island so that his curse is removed from Ireland. The druid's wife, Boí, performs purification rituals that ultimately transfer Corc's curse to an otherworldy white cow, allowing him to return to his family. Eventually he serves as hostage in Cormac mac Airt's court, where he is fostered by Óengus; he accompanies his foster father when he is expelled from Tara. He tries to convince the wandering Déisi to settle on the island of his rearing, and stays there when the Déisi opt to move on to Cashel.\n\nThe variant text MS 1336 (olim H. 3.17) occurs with the different title, \"Cóecad Cormaic i Temraig\" (Blinding of Cormac at Tara); and this text is also postscripted by a tract which alleges that the Crimall, the spear in the age of Cormac, was also the same weapon as the Lúin of Celtchar and the spear of Lugh.\n\nSection 11 of A describes Eochaid son of Artchorp traveling oversea with his descendants and settling in \"Demed\" (Demetia, later known as Dyfed in Wales). From Eochaid and his descendants springs the line of kings of Dyfed, whose descent is given down to \"Tualodor mac Rígin\" (Tudor map Regin). This genealogy has much correspondence with pedigrees in Welsh sources, namely the Harleian genealogies and the later genealogies from Jesus College MS 20. The Harleian records show the same names from Tudor back to the figure Triphun, given in \"Expulsion\" as Eochaid's great-grandson. However, Harleian gives an entirely different pedigree for Triphun himself, tracing his descent back to the Roman Emperor Constantine I. This could be an attempt by later genealogists to give a more illustrious pedigree to Dyfed's kingly line, or possibly to obscure its Irish origins. However, it could be that Harleian preserves the older and more accurate version, and that the \"Expulsion\" version is a later textual corruption.\n\nRegardless, there is indeed evidence of early Irish presence in Dyfed and elsewhere in Britain. Ogham inscriptions in an early form of Irish have been found in Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire. Additionally, later literary sources from both sides of the Irish Sea discuss the presence of southern Irish peoples in Britain. The 9th-century \"Historia Brittonum\", for instance, refers to the Uí Liatháin being active in Dyfed until they were pushed out by Cunedda and his sons (fl. mid-5th century). \"Cormac's Glossary\" also mentions the oversea exploits of the Uí Liatháin, but locates their fortress in Cornwall rather than Dyfed. However, only \"The Expulsion of the Déisi\" attests a specifically Déisi presence. Eoin MacNeill, who treats the literary accounts as largely historical, suggests that a Déisi settlement in Dyfed could have existed as a subordinate unit to a larger Uí Liatháin-led colony until the latter was expelled under Cunedda.\n\n\n"}

The popular print depicts caricatures of the British Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger and the newly-crowned Emperor of France Napoleon, both wearing military uniforms, carving up a terrestrial globe into spheres of influence. It was published as a hand-coloured print and has been described by the National Portrait Gallery as \"probably Gillray's most famous print\" and by the British Library as \"one of Gillray’s most famous satires dealing with the Napoleonic wars\".\n\nGillray's print is a satire on the overtures made by Napoleon in January 1805 for a reconciliation with Britain during the War of the Third Coalition. The short-lived Peace of Amiens, a treaty between Britain and France, had ended in 1803, and Napoleon was threatening to invade Britain with his Grande Armée based at Boulogne. \n\nThe peace overtures came to naught: before the end of the year, a combined Franco-Spanish fleet would be decisively defeated by the Royal Navy at the Battle of Trafalgar, giving Britain unrivalled control of the seas, but Napoleon would establish a dominant position in Europe by first defeating an Austrian army through manoeuvre in the Ulm Campaign, and then winning a great victory over a combined Russian-Austrian army at the Battle of Austerlitz, ending the Third Coalition with the 1805 Peace of Pressburg.\n\nPitt and Napoleon are seated on opposite sides of a dining table, each using a carving knife and carving fork to cut pieces from a large spherical plum pudding bearing a map of the world, with the British Isles at the centre between them. The scene is replete with iconography referring to the contemporary political situation during the Napoleonic Wars.\nPitt, sitting to the left, is depicted tall and emaciated. He wears a red regimental uniform of the British Army - perhaps the Cinque Port Volunteer Corps that he had raised in Kent - with powdered hair in a queue, and a cocked tricorn hat. His fork resembles a three-pronged trident, referring to Britain's naval might, and he is carving a slice of sea to the west of the British Isles marked \"ocean\" and \"West Indies\". \n\nNapoleon, to the right, the \"little corporal\", is much smaller in height and stockier in build, with a prominent hooked nose. He wears the blue coat of the Imperial French Army, and his large fore-and-aft bicorn hat has an extravagant feather plume reminiscent of a French cock. His large knife resembles a military sword, and his two-pronged fork is embedded over a region marked \"Hanover\", home of the ruling British monarchs of the House of Hanover. He is cutting away a slice of land to the east of the British Isles marked \"Europe\", but his piece of land is much smaller than Pitt's portion of sea. \n\nThe pudding rests on a large gold platter at the centre of the table, which is covered by a white tablecloth. Pitt and Napoleon each have a smaller gold plate ready for their slices, Pitt's bearing the British Royal Coat of Arms and Napoleon's an imperial crown. The back of Pitt's chair is decorated with the image of lion carrying a cross of St George (sometimes a Union Flag) and Napoleon's has an Imperial eagle clutching a \"bonnet rouge\". \n\nThe printing plate measures and was typically impressed on paper measuring around . The print includes at top left the title \"The Plumb-pudding in danger; - or - State Epicures taking un Petit Souper\" the latter half in French, meaning 'state gourmets taking a little supper' - \"Epicures\" refers to the Greek hedonist philosopher Epicurus. Below this is a quotation attributed to William Windham in the \"Political Register\" newspaper, but actually taken from Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\", Act 4, Scene 1, lines 153-4:\n\n<poem>\n\"The great Globe itself and all which it inherit\", is too small to satisfy such insatiable appetites.\n</poem>\n\nAn inscription also records that the print was designed and made by James Gillray, but it was not numbered or signed.\n\nThe print was published by Hannah Humphrey, of 27 St James's Street in London, on 26 February 1805, and was originally sold for about five shillings. There are examples in many museum and private collections. It has been described by Martin Rowson as \"probably the most famous political cartoon of all time … stolen over and over and over again by cartoonists ever since\".\n\n"}

Whereas \"The Sufis\" eschewed academic norms such as footnotes and an index, \"The Way of the Sufi\" provided a full section of notes and a bibliography at the end of its first chapter, entitled \"The Study of Sufism in the West\".\n\nShortly before he died, Shah stated that his books form a complete course that could fulfil the function he had fulfilled while alive. As such, \"The Way of the Sufi\" can be read as part of a whole course of study.\n\nAs in \"The Sufis\", Shah gave potted biographies of some of the best known Sufis of the ages, while adding brief descriptions of four of the major Sufi orders, or Tariqas: the Chisti Order, Qadiri Order, Suhrawardi Order and Naqshbandi Order. In addition there were a number of Sufi teaching stories as well as question-and-answer sessions with Sufi teachers. Continuing a theme from the previous book, Shah argued that Sufism had greatly influenced Western civilisation over the centuries, but that this had largely gone unrecognised, citing examples such as Chaucer, Shakespeare, the William Tell legend, the former United Nations secretary-general Dag Hammarskjoeld and the works of Sir Richard Burton amongst others. In the East, he also said that Sufism had influenced certain aspects of Hinduism as well as Zen Buddhism.\n\nThe book was well received on publication, with the BBC's \"The Critics\" programme declaring it an \"outstanding book of the year\".\nThe New York Times also applauded the book, saying it was \"like a door opening where one least expects it\".\nWriting in the British newspaper The Observer, Nobel Prize-winning author Doris Lessing described it as \"a key book\".\n\n"}
{"id": "28830250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28830250", "title": "Théâtre de l'Athénée", "text": "Théâtre de l'Athénée\n\nThe Théâtre de l'Athénée is a theatre at 7 rue Boudreau, in the 9th arrondissement of Paris. Renovated in 1996 and classified a historical monument, it is among the most beautiful buildings in Paris. In addition to its architectural treasures, the Athénée inherits an artistic tradition marked by the figure of Louis Jouvet who directed the theatre from 1934 to 1951. During the period when he was director, it became known as the Athenée Théâtre Louis-Jouvet.\n\nThe current Théâtre de l'Athénée was constructed from a foyer (part of the former Éden-Théâtre), which was converted into an intimate theatre in 1893 by the architect Stanislas Loison with further modifications carried out by the architect Paul Fouquiau in 1894. It opened on 31 December 1894 under the name Théâtre de la Comédie-Parisienne.\n\nOscar Wilde's play \"Salomé\" (originally written in French) was premiered there on 11 February 1896 in a staging by Lugné-Poe's theatre group, the Théâtre de l'Œuvre. The location had become rather unsafe, as demolition work on the Éden-Théâtre was in progress all around it. The police considered banning the performances due to the risk of fire or accident. Their concerns were somewhat reduced by the construction of a temporary 12-meter-long passageway from the theatre to the rue Boudreau.\n\nLater that year the construction work on the site of the former Éden theatre was finally completed by Fouquiau, and the theatre was reconstituted as the Athénée-Comique, \"from the name of a notoriously frivolous, perhaps immoral, establishment nearby that had to close ten years earlier\" [see Théâtre de l'Athénée (rue Scribe)]. The theatre was renamed Athénée in 1899. For the first 40 years it was the home of \"vaudevilles\", comedies, and melodramas.\n\nIn 1934 Louis Jouvet took control of the theatre and made it famous. He continued to produce and perform there (not exclusively, however), until his death in 1951. Among the premieres under Jouvet were several plays by Jean Giraudoux, including \"Tessa\" (14 November 1934), \"La guerre de Troie n'aura pas lieu\" (\"The Trojan War Will Not Take Place\"; 21 November 1935), \"Supplément au voyage de Cook\" (\"The Virtuous Island\"; 21 November 1935), \"Electre\" (13 May 1937), \"L'impromptu de Paris\" (3 December 1937), \"Ondine\" (3 May 1939), and \"La folle de Chaillot\" (\"The Madwoman of Chaillot\"; 22 December 1945), as well as Marcel Achard's \"Le corsaire\" (25 March 1938) and Jean Genet's \"Les bonnes\" (\"The Maids\"; 19 April 1947). One of Jouvet's most successful revivals was Molière's \"L'école des femmes\" (\"The School for Wives\"; 9 May 1936; 446 performances, plus another 229 on tour), in which Jouvet performed the role of Arnolphe.\n\nPierre Renoir, who had been an actor in Jouvet's troupe, was artistic director, briefly, from 1951 until his death the following year.\n\nIn the 2000s the Théâtre Athénée presented revivals of operetta and musical comedy, among which the Brigands company produced \"Le docteur Ox\" (2003), \"Ta Bouche\" (2004), \"Toi c'est moi\" (2005) and \"Arsène Lupin Banquier\" (2007).\n\n\n"}

The most popular and commonly used job case design in America was the California Job Case, which took its name from the Pacific Coast location of the foundries that made the case popular. These cases allowed type to be compactly transported.\n\nTraditionally, the capital letters were stored in a separate drawer, or case, placed above the case holding the other letters (this is why the capital letters are called \"uppercase\" characters, and the minuscules are \"lower case\").\n\nThere were a great variety of cases, and also variations in the \"lay\", or the assignment of the sorts into the compartments.
