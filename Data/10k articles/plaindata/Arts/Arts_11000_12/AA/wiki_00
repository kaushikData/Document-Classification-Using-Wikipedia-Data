It was inaugurated in 1880 but destroyed by bombs in 1944. It was rebuilt, slowly, in the 1970s, opening again in 1981. Many important operas were performed for the first time in Frankfurt, including Carl Orff's \"Carmina Burana\" in 1937.\n\nThe square in front of the building is known as Opernplatz (Opera Square). The Alte Oper is located in the inner city district, Innenstadt, within the banking district Bankenviertel.\n\nFrankfurt Opera is now in a modern building nearby, completed in 1951, which it shares with a theatre company.\n\nThe building was designed by the Berlin architect Richard Lucae, financed by the citizens of Frankfurt and built by Philipp Holzmann. Construction began in 1873. It opened on October 20, 1880. Among the guests was Kaiser Wilhelm I of Germany, who was impressed and said: \"Das könnte ich mir in Berlin nicht erlauben.\" (\"I couldn't permit myself this sort of thing in Berlin.\")\n\nThe citizens of Frankfurt, who had to finance the structure (initial estimate two million marks), were rather sceptical at first.

The then Minister of Economy in Hessen Rudi Arndt, earned the nickname \"Dynamit-Rudi\" (Dynamite Rudi) when he proposed to blow up \"Germany's most beautiful ruin\" with \"a little dynamite\". Arndt later said that this was not meant seriously.\n\nA citizen's initiative campaigned for reconstruction funds after 1953 and collected 15 million DM. It ended costing c. DM160, and the building was reopened on August 28, 1981, to the sounds of Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 8, the \"Symphony of a Thousand\".

It is housed in the Badia Fiorentina, a church in Florence.\n\nThe picture was commissioned for the chapel of Francesco del Pugliese by the latter's son Piero, who is portrayed in the lower right corner in the traditional praying posture of the donor portrait.\n\nIt is one of the most admired Lippi's works, due to its powerful, Flemish-inspired chromatism and attention to details, which contribute in turning the mystical apparition of the Virgin to St. Bernard into an everyday life scene. The composition is set in a rocky landscape in which the saint, while writing on his lectern, is suddenly visited by the Virgin. Behind Bernard's shoulders is depicted the demon biting his chains: this is a reference to a medieval hymn celebrating the Virgin as the liberator of humanity from the chains of their sins.\n\nA scroll on a rock contains a verse by the 3rd century AD stoic writer Epictetus: \"Sustine et abstine\" (\"Carry on and abstain\"), a hint to Bernard's teachings.\n\nSome scholars have identified in the faces of the Virgin and the angels on the left the portraits of the donor's wife and sons\n\n"}

Its name refers to Donatus of Zadar, who began construction on this church in the 9th century and ended it on the northeastern part of the Roman forum. \n\nOriginally named Church of the Holy Trinity, in the 15th century it was re-dedicated to St Donatus. The church is the largest Pre-Romanesque building in Croatia. It is also an example of the centralised type of the Carolingian period in Europe.\n\nThe beginning of the building of the church was placed to the second half of the 8th century, and it is supposed to be completed in the 9th century. The Zadar bishop and diplomat Donat (8th and 9th centuries) is credited with the building of the church. He led the representations of the Dalmatian cities to Constantinople and Charles the Great, which is why this church bears slight resemblance to Charlemagne's court chapels, especially the one in Aachen (now Aachen Cathedral), and also to the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna. It belongs to the Pre-Romanesque architectural period.\n\nThe circular church, formerly domed, is 27 m high and is characterised by simplicity and technical primitivism. It has three radially situated apses and an ambulatory around the central area, surmounted by circular gallery. The circular shape is typical of the early medieval age in Dalmatia. It was built on the Roman forum, and materials from buildings in the latter were used in its construction. Among the fragments which are built into the foundations it is still possible to distinguish the remains of a sacrificial altar on which is written IVNONI AVGUSTE IIOVI AVGUSTO.\n\nThe use of the church has varied during its lifetime; during the rule of the Republic of Venice it was a warehouse, as well as during the French occupation and under the Austrians. After the city was annexed to Yugoslavia, it served as an archaeological museum for a short period of time. The building is currently used as the concert venue for the annual International Festival of Medieval Renaissance Music (Musical Evenings in St Donatus) due to the building's interiors and acoustics.\n\n\n"}

He was an assistant and protégé of Ambroise Vollard.\n\nŠlomović was born in Đakovo (Austro-Hungarian Empire) in 1915 to a Jewish family of Bernard and Roza Šlomović. He had a brother, Egon.\n\nIn the 1930s, Šlomović moved to Paris, where he was befriended by legendary art collector Ambroise Vollard. Through Vollard, Šlomović met the greatest artists of the age, including Picasso, Matisse, Cocteau, Rouault among others, and was able to amass an impressive personal collection of some 600 works. Vollard died in a car accident in July 1939. Shortly after that, with France on the brink of Nazi invasion, Šlomović decided to return to Yugoslavia, where the war had not yet spread. He left about 200 artworks in a vault in the Société Générale in Paris, and the rest he had shipped via diplomatic pouch to Belgrade. These were exhibited at a highly acclaimed exhibition in Zagreb in 1940.\n\nDuring World War II, with the Independent State of Croatia establishment in 1941, Šlomović and his family moved to Bačina in Serbia in an attempt to save themselves.\nWhile in Bačina, Šlomović hid the paintings he brought with him. Later, as a part of the German reprisals of 100 Serbian men shot for every German soldier killed, Bernard, Erich and Egon were taken to detention camp in Ćuprija. Soon after, they were all killed. Erich's mother Rosa and female cousin Mara were not touched and neither was his collection. They both survived the Holocaust hidden by the local population.\n\nAfter his death, Šlomović mother donated his collection to the National Museum of Serbia. In 1989 Veljko Bulajić directed \"Donator\", a movie dedicated to Šlomović's tragic life while in 2004 Momo Kapor wrote a book about his life. The paintings in the Société Generale bank were discovered in 1979 when the bank was allowed to open the vault to recover unpaid storage fees. There is a legal dispute over the ownership of those paintings.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "509792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=509792", "title": "Frida", "text": "Frida\n\nFrida is a 2002 American biopic drama film directed by Julie Taymor. It depicts the professional and private life of the surrealist Mexican painter Frida Kahlo. It stars Salma Hayek in her Academy Award-nominated portrayal as Kahlo and Alfred Molina as her husband, Diego Rivera. The movie was adapted by Clancy Sigal, Diane Lake, Gregory Nava, Anna Thomas and unofficially by Edward Norton from the book \"Frida: A Biography of Frida Kahlo\" by Hayden Herrera.\n\n\"Frida\" received generally positive reviews from critics, and won two Academy Awards for Best Makeup and Best Original Score among six nominations.\n\n\"Frida\" begins just before the traumatic accident Frida Kahlo (Salma Hayek) suffered at the age of 18 when the wooden-bodied bus she was riding in collided with a streetcar. She is impaled by a metal pole and the injuries she sustained plague her for the rest of her life. To help her through convalescence, her father brings her a canvas upon which to start painting. Throughout the film, a scene starts as a painting, then slowly dissolves into a live action scene with actors.\n\n\"Frida\" also details the artist's dysfunctional relationship with the muralist Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina). When Rivera proposes to Kahlo, she tells him she expects from him loyalty if not fidelity. Diego's appraisal of her painting ability is one of the reasons that she continues to paint. Throughout the marriage, Rivera has affairs with a wide array of women, while the bisexual Kahlo takes on male and female lovers, including in one case having an affair with the same woman as Rivera.\n\nThe two travel to New York City so that he may paint the mural \"Man at the Crossroads\" at the Rockefeller Center. While in the United States, Kahlo suffers a miscarriage, and her mother dies in Mexico. Rivera refuses to compromise his communist vision of the work to the needs of the patron, Nelson Rockefeller (Edward Norton); as a result, the mural is destroyed. The pair return to Mexico, with Rivera the more reluctant of the two.\n\nKahlo's sister Cristina moves in with the two at their San Ángel studio home to work as Rivera's assistant. Soon afterward, Kahlo discovers that Rivera is having an affair with her sister. She leaves him, and subsequently sinks into alcoholism. The couple reunite when he asks her to welcome and house Leon Trotsky (Geoffrey Rush), who has been granted political asylum in Mexico. She and Trotsky begin an affair, which forces the married Trotsky to leave the safety of his Coyoacán home.\n\nKahlo leaves for Paris after Diego realizes she was unfaithful to him with Trotsky; although Rivera had little problem with Kahlo's other affairs, Trotsky was too important to Rivera to be intimately involved with his wife. When she returns to Mexico, he asks for a divorce. Soon afterwards, Trotsky is murdered in Mexico City. Rivera is temporarily a suspect, and Kahlo is incarcerated in his place when he is not found. Rivera helps get her released.\n\nKahlo has her toes removed when they become gangrenous. Rivera asks her to remarry him, and she agrees. Her health continues to worsen, including the amputation of a leg, and she ultimately dies after finally having a solo exhibition of her paintings in Mexico.\n\nThe passengers in the bus Kahlo rides in that crashes with a streetcar are based on subjects in the painter's 1929 portrait, \"The Bus\". The Brothers Quay-created stop motion animation sequence depicting the initial stages of Kahlo's recovery at the hospital after the accident are inspired by the Mexican holiday Day of the Dead. The gown Valeria Golino wears at Kahlo's 1953 Mexican solo art exhibition is a replica of the dress her character Lupe Marín wore in Rivera's 1938 portrait of her.\n\nThe film version of Frida Kahlo's life was initially championed by Nancy Hardin, a former book editor and Hollywood-based literary agent, turned early \"female studio executive\", who, in the mid-1980s wished to \"make the transition to independent producing.\" Learning of Hayden Herrara's biography of Kahlo, Hardin saw Kahlo's life as very contemporary, her \"story ... an emblematic tale for women torn between marriage and career.\" Optioning the book in 1988, Hardin \"tried to sell it as an epic love story in the tradition of \"Out of Africa\", attracting tentative interest from actresses such as Meryl Streep and Jessica Lange, but receiving rejection from the film studios. As Kahlo's art gained prominence, however \"in May, 1990 one of Kahlo's self-portraits sold at Sotheby's for $1.5 million, the highest price ever paid at auction for a Latin American painting.\" Madonna \"announced her plans to star in a film based on Frida's life\", and Robert De Niro's Tribeca Productions reportedly \"envisioned a joint biography of Rivera and Kahlo.\" In the spring of 1991, director Luis Valdez began production on a New Line feature about Frida Kahlo starring Laura San Giacomo in the lead. San Giacomo's casting received objections due to her non-Hispanic ethnicity, and New Line complied with the protesters' demands, and left the then-titled \"Frida and Diego\" in August, 1992 citing finances. Hardin's project found itself swamped by similar ones:\n\nWhen I first tried to sell the project ... there was no interest because nobody had heard of Frida. A few years later, I heard the exact oppositethat there were too many Frida projects in development, and nobody wanted mine. \n\nValdez was contacted early on by thethen unknown in the U.S.Salma Hayek, who sent \"her [promo] reel to the director and phoned his office\", but was ultimately told she was then too young for the role. By 1993, Valdez had retitled the film \"The Two Fridas\" with San Giacomo and Ofelia Medina both playing the portraitist. Raúl Juliá was cast as Diego Rivera, but his death further delayed the movie. At the same time, Hardin approached HBO, and with \"rising young development executive and producer\" Lizz Speed (a former assistant to Sherry Lansing) intended to make a television movie, hopeful that Brian Gibson (director of \"\"What's Love Got to Do With It\", the story of Tina Turner\" and \"The Josephine Baker Story\") would direct. Casting difficulties proved insurmountable, but Speed joined Hardin in advocating the project, and after four years in development, the two took the project from HBO to Trimark and producer Jay Polstein (with assistant Darlene Caamaño). At Trimark, Salma Hayek became interested in the role, having \"been fascinated by Kahlo's work from the time she was 13 or 14\"although not immediately a fan:\n\nHayek was so determined to play the role that she sought out Dolores Olmedo Patino, longtime-lover of Diego Rivera, and (after his death) administrator to the rights of Frida and Rivera's art, which Rivera had \"willed ... to the Mexican people\", bequeath[ing] the trust to Olmedo. Salma Hayek personally secured access to Kahlo's paintings from her, and began to assemble a supporting cast, approaching Alfred Molina for the role of Rivera in 1998. According to Molina, \"She turned up backstage [of the Broadway play \"'Art'\"] rather sheepishly, and asked if I would like to play Diego\". Molina went on to gain 35 pounds to play Rivera. When producer Polstein left Trimark, however, the production faltered again, and Hayek approached Harvey Weinstein and Miramax, and the company purchased the film from Trimark; Julie Taymor came onto the project as Director. Meanwhile, in August 2000 it was announced that Jennifer Lopez would star in Valdez<nowiki>'</nowiki>s take on the story, \"The Two Fridas\", by then being produced by American Zoetrope. Nonetheless, it was Hayek and Miramax who began production in Spring, 2001 on what was to become simply titled \"Frida\". Edward Norton rewrote the script at least once but was not credited as a writer.\n\nIn a December 2017 op-ed for \"The New York Times\", Hayek stated that Weinstein attempted to thwart the making of the film because Hayek had refused to grant him sexual favors and also threatened to shut down the film unless Hayek agreed to include a full frontal nude sex scene with herself and another woman. In response, Weinstein claimed that none of the sexual allegations made by Hayek were accurate and that he did not recall pressuring Hayek \"to do a gratuitous sex scene.\"\n\nOn August 29, 2002, the film made its world premiere opening the Venice International Film Festival. \"Frida\"'s American premiere was at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in Los Angeles on October 14 of that year. It had its Mexican premiere on November 8, 2002 at Mexico City's Palace of Fine Arts.\n\n\"Frida\" was initially shown in five theaters and earned $205,996 upon its opening weekend in the United States. The following week the film expanded to forty-seven theaters, earning $1,323,935. By late December 2002, \"Frida\" was playing in 283 theaters and had earned over $20 million. The film earned $56,298,474 in its worldwide total gross.\n\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 75% of 153 critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 6.9/10. According to the site's summary of the critical consensus, \"\"Frida\" is a passionate, visually striking biopic about the larger-than-life artist.\" Metacritic, which assigns a score of 1–100 to individual film reviews, gives the film an average rating of 61 based on 38 reviews. Stella Papamichael from the BBC gave the film three out of five stars and stated \"Julie Taymor's biography of Mexican painter Frida Kahlo connects the dots between art and anguish. The disparity lies in the fact that Frida settles for tickling a fancy where it should be packing a punch. Although involving and sprightly, it offers the kind of guilty pleasure a Fine Arts student might derive from a glossy cartoon strip.\" Film critic Roger Ebert awarded \"Frida\" three and a half stars and commented \"Sometimes we feel as if the film careens from one colorful event to another without respite, but sometimes it must have seemed to Frida Kahlo as if her life did, too.\" Ebert thought Taymor and the writers had \"obviously struggled with the material\", though he called the closing scenes \"extraordinary.\" The \"New York Post's\" Jonathan Foreman praised the score and Taymor's direction, saying that she \"captures both the glamorous, deeply cosmopolitan milieu Kahlo and Rivera inhabited, and the importance Mexico had in the '30s for the international left.\" He added that the odd accents adopted by the likes of Judd and Rush let the authenticity down. Andrew Pulver from \"The Guardian\" gave the film three stars and proclaimed that it is \"a substantial film, its story told with economy and clarity.\"\n\nThe American Film Institute included \"Frida\" in their Movies of the Year 2002, Official Selection. Their rationale was:\n\n\"Frida\" is a movie about art that is a work of art in itself. The film's unique visual language takes us into an artist's head and reminds us that art is best enjoyed when it moves, breathes and is painted on a giant canvas, as only the movies can provide.\n\n\n"}

She was the second woman to be admitted to a Greek university and was a trained physiotherapist prior to taking up her religious calling at the age of 60.\n\nAvrilia Papayannis was born on 15 October (2 October O.S.) 1897 N.S. in Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire as the youngest child of Helias and Victoria Papayannis, a wealthy Greek family. She grew up in Constantinople and lived there until her family was deported during the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey and sent to Thessaloniki. She entered the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, becoming the second woman ever admitted to a Greek university, where she earned a degree in philosophy. She had previously graduated with a degree in botany at a Swiss university. In 1932, she moved to Athens and cared for nursing home residents until 1938 when she moved to England to study podiatry and physiotherapy, where she remained until the end of World War II.\n\nIn 1945, Papayannis returned to Greece and began working with the American Farm School and Friends Relief Service in Thessaloniki, until 1947, when she moved to Athens and opened a physiotherapy practice. For a decade she operated her office using funds from her paying clients to provide assistance to the poor. Upon the death of her mother, in 1954, she took a vow of poverty and gave all her worldly possessions away. The following year, she moved to India to work with the poor and assist Baba Amte in his work with leper communities in India. After four years of providing free physiotherapy to the poor, Papayannis went to the Himalayan Mountains, spending eleven months in solitude as a hermit. She then traveled to Landour where she met an American woman, who arranged for her to go to the monastery headed by Father Theodosius in Bethany, in the Holy Land in 1960. She arrived at the Bethany Community of the Resurrection of the Lord and after accepting tonsure became a nun. After her three-year novitiate, Papayannis took the name Gavrielia.\n\nSister Gavrielia was sent to the Taizé Community in France by the Patriarch Athenagoras I of Constantinople, though her assignment there was brief. She was then sent to the United States, where she toured ethnic Greek communities in seventeen states and accompanied many mentally ill patients to psychiatric hospitals in Europe. After nearly a decade of touring, speaking, and helping the sick, she was sent to East Africa for three years to do missionary work. Following a brief assignment in Germany, Sister Gavrielia was sent back to India, where she remained for three years. In 1979, she was given use of an Athens apartment and became a \"Gerontissa\" (elder), counseling disciples and helping the sick over the next ten years. Near the end of her life, she retreated to a hermitage in Aegina, but when she developed Hodgkin's disease she returned to Athens. After a miraculous healing, she left Athens two years before her death and moved to the island of Leros. Gerontissa Gavrielia died on Leros on 28 March, 1992.\n\nIn 1996 a biography of her life entitled \"I Askitiki tis Agapis\" was published in Greek, in 1999 the book was translated into English, and in 2000 into Russian. It has since had 14 Greek editions, 2 English editions, and has been translated into Arabic, French and Serbian.\n\n"}

Five of these figurines are now lost, while two were bought by the Danish National Museum in 1823 and 1839. \n\nBased on comparison with petroglyphs of the same era (e.g. Tanumshede, Sweden), it is assumed that the figurines were originally part of an ensemble arranged on a ship.\n\nBoth the twins motive and the cultic significance of the horned helmets, seems to have persisted into early Germanic culture.

{"id": "45656536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45656536", "title": "History of Persian domes", "text": "History of Persian domes\n\nPersian domes or Iranian domes have an ancient origin and a history extending to the modern era. The use of domes in ancient Mesopotamia was carried forward through a succession of empires in the Greater Persia region. \n\nAn ancient tradition of royal audience tents representing the heavens was translated into monumental stone and brick domes due to the invention of the squinch, a reliable method of supporting the circular base of a heavy dome upon the walls of a square chamber. Domes were built as part of royal palaces, castles, caravansaries, and temples, among other structures. \n\nWith the introduction of Islam in the 7th century, mosque and mausoleum architecture also adopted and developed these forms. Structural innovations included pointed domes, drums, conical roofs, double and triple shells, and the use of muqarnas and bulbous forms. Decorative brick patterning, interlaced ribs, painted plaster, and colorful tiled mosaics were used to decorate the exterior as well as the interior surfaces.\n\nPersian domes from different historical eras can be distinguished by their transition tiers: the squinches, spandrels, or brackets that transition from the supporting structures to the circular base of a dome. Drums, after the Ilkanate era, tend to be very similar and have an average height of 30 to 35 meters from the ground. They are where windows are located. Inner shells are commonly semi-circular, semi-elliptical, pointed, or saucer shaped. The outer shell of a Persian dome reduces in thickness every 25 or 30 degrees from the base. Outer shells can be semi-circular, semi-elliptical, pointed, conical, or bulbous, and this outer shape is used to categorize them. Pointed domes can be sub-categorized as having shallow, medium, and sharp profiles, and bulbous domes as either shallow or sharp. Double domes use internal stiffeners with wooden struts between the shells, with the exception of those with conical outer shells. \n\nPersian architecture likely inherited an architectural tradition of dome-building dating back to the earliest Mesopotamian domes. Due to the scarcity of wood in many areas of the Iranian plateau, domes were an important part of vernacular architecture throughout Persian history.\n\nAlthough they had palaces of brick and stone, the kings of Achaemenid Persia held audiences and festivals in domical tents derived from the nomadic traditions of central Asia. They were likely similar to the later tents of the Mongol Khans. Called \"Heavens\", these tents emphasized the cosmic significance of the divine ruler. They were adopted by Alexander the Great after his conquest of the empire, and the domed baldachin of Roman and Byzantine practice was presumably inspired by this association.\n\nThe remains of a large domed circular hall measuring 17 meters in diameter in the Parthian capital city of Nyssa has been dated to perhaps the first century AD. It \"shows the existence of a monumental domical tradition in Central Asia that had hitherto been unknown and which seems to have preceded Roman Imperial monuments or at least to have grown independently from them.\" It likely had a wooden dome.\n\nThe Sun Temple at Hatra appears to indicate a transition from columned halls with trabeated roofing to vaulted and domed construction in the first century AD, at least in Mesopotamia. The domed sanctuary hall of the temple was preceded by a barrel vaulted iwan, a combination that would be used by the subsequent Persian Sasanian Empire.\n\nAn account of a Parthian domed palace hall from around 100 AD in the city of Babylon can be found in the \"Life of Apollonius of Tyana\" by Philostratus. The hall was used by the king for passing judgments and was decorated with a mosaic of blue stone to resemble the sky, with images of gods in gold.\n\nA bulbous Parthian dome can be seen in the relief sculpture of the Arch of Septimius Severus in Rome, its shape apparently due to the use of a light tent-like framework.\n\nCaravansaries used the domed bay from the Sasanian period to the Qajar dynasty. The Persian invention of the squinch, a series of concentric arches forming a half-cone over the corner of a room, enabled the transition from the walls of a square chamber to an octagonal base for a dome. Previous transitions to a dome from a square chamber existed but were makeshift in quality and only attempted on a small scale, not being reliable enough for large constructions. The squinch enabled domes to be widely used and they moved to the forefront of Persian architecture as a result. \n\nThe ruins of the Palace of Ardashir and Ghal'eh Dokhtar in Fars Province, Iran, built by Ardashir I (224–240) of the Sasanian Empire, have the earliest known examples of squinches. The three domes of the Palace of Ardashir are 45 feet in diameter and vertically elliptical, each with a central opening or oculus to admit light. They were built with local stone and mortar and covered with plaster on the interior. At the center of the palace of Shahpur, at Bishapur, there is a vertically-elliptical dome that rests directly on the ground and is dated to 260. The large brick dome of the Sarvestan Palace, also in Fars but later in date, shows more elaborate decoration and four windows between the corner squinches. Also called \"the Temple of Anahita\", the building may have been a Fire temple. Instead of using a central oculus in each dome, as at the Palace of Ardashir and as shown in the bas relief found at Kuyunjik, lighting was provided by a number of hollow terracotta cylinders set into the domes at regular intervals. \n\nMultiple written accounts from Arabic, Byzantine, and Western medieval sources describe a palace domed structure over the throne of Chosroes decorated in blue and gold. The dome was covered with depictions of the sun, moon, stars, planets, the zodiac, astrapai, and kings, including Chosroes himself. According to Ado and others, the dome could produce rain, and could be rotated with a sound like thunder by means of ropes pulled by horses in a basement. The castle of Qasr-e Shirin had a domed chamber at the end of a long barrel-vaulted iwan. The late-Sasanian Tāq-i Kasrā in Ctesiphon may also have led to a domed throne room.\n\"Chahar-taqi\", or \"four vaults\", were smaller Zoroastrian fire temple structures with four supports arranged in a square, connected by four arches, and covered by central ovoid domes. The Niasar Zoroastrian temple in Kashan and the \"chahar-taqi\" in Darreh Shahr are examples. Such temples, square domed buildings with entrances at the axes, inspired the forms of early mosques after the Islamic conquest of the empire in the 7th century. These domes are the most numerous surviving type from the Sasanian period, with some having been converted into mosques. The later isolated dome chambers called the \"kiosk mosque\" type may have developed from this. Pre-Islamic domes in Persia are commonly semi-elliptical, with pointed domes and those with conical outer shells being the majority of the domes in the Islamic periods.\n\nAlthough the Sasanians did not create monumental tombs, the domed chahar-taqi may have served as memorials. A Soghdian painting fragment from the early eighth century found at Panjakent appears to depict a funerary dome (possibly a tent) and this, along with a few ossuaries of an architectural nature, indicates a possible tradition in central Asia of a funerary association with the domed form. The area of north-eastern Iran was, along with Egypt, one of two areas notable for early developments in Islamic domed mausoleums, which appear in the tenth century.\n\nThe earliest known Islamic domes in Persia, such as the Great Mosque of Qom (878) and the tomb of Muhammed b. Musa (976), seem to have continued the rounded Sasanian form. Domed mausoleums contributed greatly to the development and spread of the dome in Persia early in the Islamic period. By the 10th century, domed tombs had been built for Abbasid caliphs and Shiite martyrs. Pilgrimage to these sites may have helped to spread the form.\n\nThe earliest surviving example, the Qubbat-al Sulaibiya, was an octagonal structure with a central dome on a drum built around 892 in Samarra. Free-standing domed pavilions are known from Shiraz and Bukhara in the tenth century. The Samanid Mausoleum in Transoxiana dates to no later than 943 and is the first to have squinches create a regular octagon as a base for the dome, which then became the standard practice. The Arab-Ata Mausoleum, also in Transoxiana, may be dated to 977–78 and uses muqarnas between the squinches for a more unified transition to the dome. Cylindrical or polygonal plan tower tombs with conical roofs over domes also exist beginning in the 11th century. The earliest example is the Gonbad-e Qabus tower tomb, 57 meters high and spanning 9.7 meters, which was built in 1007.\n\nThe Seljuq Turks built tower tombs, called \"Turkish Triangles\", as well as cube mausoleums covered with a variety of dome forms. Seljuk domes included conical, semi-circular, and pointed shapes in one or two shells. Shallow semi-circular domes are mainly found from the Seljuk era. The double-shell domes were either discontinuous or continuous. The continuous double-shell domes separated from one another at an angle of 22.5 degrees from their base, such as the dome of the Friday mosque in Ardestan, whereas the discontinuous domes remained completely separate, such as those of the tower tombs of Kharrqan. This pair of brick tower tombs from the 11th century in Kharraqan, Iran, are the earliest known masonry double shell domes. The domes may have been modeled on earlier wooden double shell domes, such as that of the Dome of the Rock. It is also possible, because the upper portions of both of the outer shells are missing, that some portion of the outer domes may have been wooden. These brick mausoleum domes were built without the use of centering, a technique developed in Persia.\n\nThe Seljuq Empire introduced the domed enclosure in front of the mosque's mihrab, which would become popular in Persian congregational mosques, although domed rooms may have also been used earlier in small neighborhood mosques. The domed enclosure of the Jameh Mosque of Isfahan, built in 1086-7 by Nizam al-Mulk, was the largest masonry dome in the Islamic world at that time, had eight ribs, and introduced a new form of corner squinch with two quarter domes supporting a short barrel vault. In 1088 Tāj-al-Molk, a rival of Nizam al-Mulk, built another dome at the opposite end of the same mosque with interlacing ribs forming five-pointed stars and pentagons. This is considered the landmark Seljuk dome, and may have inspired subsequent patterning and the domes of the Il-Khanate period. The use of tile and of plain or painted plaster to decorate dome interiors, rather than brick, increased under the Seljuks. One of the largest Seljuq domes, built over the site of a Sassanian Fire Temple, was that of the Jameh Mosque of Qazvin with a span of 15.2 meters. The largest Seljuq domed chamber was the Tomb of Ahmed Sanjar, which had a large double shell, intersecting ribs over plain squinches, and an exterior elaborately decorated at the zone of transition with arches and stucco work. The tomb of Sultan Sanjar, who reigned from 1117 to 1157, was damaged in the sack of Merv in 1221 by Tolui Khan.\n\nAfter the disruptive effects of several Mongol invasions, Persian architecture again flourished in the Ilkhanate and Timurid periods. Characteristic of these domes are the use of high drums and several types of discontinuous double-shells, and the development of triple-shells and internal stiffeners occurred at this time. Beginning in the Ilkanate, Persian domes achieved their final configuration of structural supports, zone of transition, drum, and shells, and subsequent evolution was restricted to variations in form and shell geometry. The construction of tomb towers decreased.\n\nThe two major domes of the IlKhanate period are the no-longer-existing mausoleum of Ghazan in Tabriz and the Mausoleum of Öljaitü in Soltaniyeh, the latter having been built to rival the former. Öljaitü was the first sovereign of Persia to declare himself of the Shia sect of Islam and built the mausoleum, with the largest Persian dome, to house the bodies of Ali and Hussein as a pilgrimage site. This did not occur and it became his own mausoleum instead. The dome measures 50 meters high and almost 25 meters in diameter and has the best surviving tile and stucco work from this period. The thin, double-shelled dome was reinforced by arches between the layers.\n\nTower tombs of this period, such as the tomb of Abdas-Samad Esfahani in Natanz, sometimes have muqarnas domes, although they are usually plaster shells that hide the underlying structures. The tall proportions of the Jameh Mosque of Varamin resulted primarily from the increased height of the zone of transition, with the addition of a sixteen-sided section above the main zone of muqarnas squinches. The 7.5 meter wide double dome of Soltan Bakht Agha Mausoleum (1351–1352) is the earliest known example in which the two shells of the dome have significantly different profiles, which spread rapidly throughout the region. The inner and outer shells had radial stiffeners and struts between them. An early example of a dome chamber almost completely covered with decorative tilework is that of the Jame Mosque of Yazd (1364), as well as several of the mausoleums of Shah-i-Zinda in Samarkand. The development of taller drums also continued into the Timurid period.\n\nAt the Timurid capital of Samarkand, nobles and rulers in the 14th and 15th centuries began building tombs with double-shelled domes containing cylindrical masonry drums between the shells. In the Gur-e Amir, built by Timur around 1404, a timber framework on the inner dome supports the outer, bulbous dome. Radial tie-bars at the base of the bulbous dome provide additional structural support. Timber reinforcement rings and rings of stone linked by iron cramps were also used to compensate for the structural problems introduced by using such drums. Radial sections of brick walls with wooden struts were used between the shells of discontinuous double domes to provide structural stability as late at the 14th century.\nA miniature painted at Samarkand shows that bulbous cupolas were used to cover small wooden pavilions in Persia by the beginning of the fifteenth century. They gradually gained in popularity. The large, bulbous, fluted domes on tall drums that are characteristic of 15th century Timurid architecture were the culmination of the Central Asian and Iranian tradition of tall domes with glazed tile coverings in blue and other colors. The Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi, situated in southern Kazakhstan was never finished, but has the largest existing brick dome in Central Asia, measuring 18.2 m in diameter. The dome exterior is covered with hexagonal green glazed tiles with gold patterns.\n\nMausoleums were rarely built as free-standing structures after the 14th century, being instead often attached to madrasas in pairs. Domes of these madrasas, such as those of the madrasa of Goharshad (1417–1433) and the madrasa at Ḵargerd (1436–1443), had dramatically innovative interiors. They used intersecting arches to support an inner dome narrower than the floor below, a change that may have originated with the 14th century use of small lantern domes over transverse vaulting. The madrasa of Goharshad is also the first triple-shell dome. The middle dome may have been added as reinforcement. Triple-shelled domes are rare outside of the Timurid era. The dome of the Amir Chakhmaq mosque (1437) has a semi-circular inner shell and an advanced system of stiffeners and wooden struts supporting a shallow pointed outer shell. Notably, the dome has a circular drum with two tiers. Another double shell dome from the early Seljuq period at the shrine complex of Bayazid Bastami was changed in the Timurid period by the addition of a third conical shell over the existing two domed shells.\n\nThe Uzbek architecture of the region around Transoxiana maintained the Timurid style of dome-building. Where dome chambers were surrounded by axial iwans and corner rooms on an octagonal plan, as at the Khwaja Abu Nasr Parsa shrine (ca. 1598), they provided the model for Indian mausoleums such as Humayun's Tomb in Delhi or the Taj Mahal. Some of the earliest surviving domed markets, called \"tīmcās\", can be found in Shaybanid-era Bukhara.\n\nThe domes of the Safavid dynasty (1501–1732) are characterized by a distinctive bulbous profile and are considered to be the last generation of Persian domes. They are generally thinner than earlier domes and are decorated with a variety of colored glazed tiles and complex vegetal patterns. The dome of the Blue Mosque in Tabriz (1465) had its interior covered with \"dark-blue hexagonal tiles with stenciled gilding\". The palace of Ālī Qāpū includes small domed rooms decorated with artificial vegetation.\n\nThe dome of Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque in Isfahan (1603–1618), perhaps \"the quintessential Persian dome chamber\", blends the square room with the zone of transition and uses plain squinches like those of the earlier Seljuq period. On the exterior, multiple levels of glazed arabesque are blended with an unglazed brick background. The domes of the Shah Mosque (later renamed the Imam Mosque) and the Mādar-e Šāh madrasa have a similar exterior pattern against a background of light blue glazed tile. The bulbous dome of the Shah Mosque was built from 1611 to 1638 and is a discontinuous double-shell 33 meters wide and 52 meters high. The oldest example of the Safavid onion dome is over the octagonal mausoleum of Khwaja Rabi (1617–1622). Safavid domes were influential on those of other Islamic styles, such as the Mughal architecture of India.\n\nIn the Qajar period (1779–1924), the movement to modern architecture meant less innovation in dome construction. Domes were built over madrasas, such as the 1848 Imam madrasa, or Sultani school, of Kashan, but they have relatively simple appearances and do not use tiled mosaics. The covered markets or bazaars (\"tīmcās\") at Qom and Kashan feature a central dome with smaller domes on either side and elaborate muqarnas. An exaggerated style of onion dome on a short drum, as can be seen at the Shah Cheragh (1852–1853), first appeared in the Qajar period. Domes have remained important in modern mausoleums, such as the tombs of Ḥāfeẓ, Saʿdī, Reza Shah, and Ruhollah Khomeini in the twentieth century. Domed cisterns and icehouses remain common sights in the countryside.\n\n"}
{"id": "13633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13633", "title": "Homer", "text": "Homer\n\nHomer (; , \"Hómēros\") is the legendary author of the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\", two epic poems that are the central works of ancient Greek literature. The \"Iliad\" is set during the Trojan War, the ten-year siege of the city of Troy by a coalition of Greek kingdoms. It focuses on a quarrel between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles lasting a few weeks during the last year of the war. The \"Odyssey\" focuses on the journey home of Odysseus, king of Ithaca, around 20 years after the fall of Troy. Many accounts of Homer's life circulated in classical antiquity, the most widespread being that he was a blind bard from Ionia, a region of central coastal Anatolia in present-day Turkey. Modern scholars consider them legends.\n\nThe Homeric Question—concerning by whom, when, where and under what circumstances the \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\" were composed—continues to be debated. Broadly speaking, modern scholarly opinion falls into two groups. One holds that most of the \"Iliad\" and (according to some) the \"Odyssey\" are the works of a single poet of genius. The other considers the Homeric poems to be the result of a process of working and reworking by many contributors, and that \"Homer\" is best seen as a label for an entire tradition. It is generally accepted that the poems were composed at some point around the late eighth or early seventh century BC.\n\nThe poems are in Homeric Greek, also known as Epic Greek, a literary language which shows a mixture of features of the Ionic and Aeolic dialects from different centuries; the predominant influence is Eastern Ionic. Most researchers believe that the poems were originally transmitted orally. From antiquity until the present day, the influence of the Homeric epics on Western civilization has been great, inspiring many of its most famous works of literature, music, art and film. The Homeric epics were the greatest influence on ancient Greek culture and education; to Plato, Homer was simply the one who \"has taught Greece\" – \"ten Hellada pepaideuken\".\n\nToday only the \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\" are associated with the name 'Homer'. In antiquity, a very large number of other works were sometimes attributed to him, including the \"Homeric Hymns\", the \"Contest of Homer and Hesiod\", the \"Little Iliad\", the \"Nostoi\", the \"Thebaid\", the \"Cypria\", the \"Epigoni\", the comic mini-epic \"Batrachomyomachia\" (\"The Frog-Mouse War\"), the \"Margites\", the \"Capture of Oechalia\", and the \"Phocais\". These claims are not considered authentic today and were by no means universally accepted in the ancient world. As with the multitude of legends surrounding Homer's life, they indicate little more than the centrality of Homer to ancient Greek culture.\n\nMany traditions circulated in the ancient world concerning Homer, most of which are lost. Modern scholarly consensus is that they have no value as history. \n\nSome claims were established early and repeated often. They include that Homer was blind (taking as self-referential a passage describing the blind bard Demodocus), that he was born in Chios, that he was the son of the river Meles and the nymph Critheïs, that he was a wandering bard, that he composed a varying list of other works (the \"Homerica\"), that he died either in Ios or after failing to solve a riddle set by fishermen, and various explanations for the name \"Homer\". The two best known ancient biographies of Homer are the \"Life of Homer\" by the Pseudo-Herodotus and the \"Contest of Homer and Hesiod\".\n\n The study of Homer is one of the oldest topics in scholarship, dating back to antiquity. Nonetheless, the aims of Homeric studies have changed over the course of the millennia. The earliest preserved comments on Homer concern his treatment of the gods, which hostile critics such as the poet Xenophanes of Colophon denounced as immoral. The allegorist Theagenes of Rhegium is said to have defended Homer by arguing that the Homeric poems are allegories. The \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\" were widely used as school texts in ancient Greek and Hellenistic cultures. They were the first literary works taught to all students. The \"Iliad\", particularly its first few books, was far more intently studied than the \"Odyssey\" during the Hellenistic and Roman periods.\n\nAs a result of the poems' prominence in classical Greek education, extensive commentaries on them developed to explain parts of the poems that were culturally or linguistically difficult. During the Hellenistic and Roman Periods, many interpreters, especially the Stoics, who believed that Homeric poems conveyed Stoic doctrines, regarded them as allegories, containing hidden wisdom. Perhaps partially because of the Homeric poems' extensive use in education, many authors believed that Homer's original purpose had been to educate. Homer's wisdom became so widely praised that he began to acquire the image of almost a prototypical philosopher. Byzantine scholars such as Eustathius of Thessalonica and John Tzetzes produced commentaries, extensions and scholia to Homer, especially in the twelfth century. Eustathius's commentary on the \"Iliad\" alone is massive, sprawling nearly 4,000 oversized pages in a twenty-first century printed version and his commentary on the \"Odyssey\" an additional nearly 2,000.\n\nIn 1488, the Greek scholar Demetrios Chalkokondyles published the \"editio princeps\" of the Homeric poems. The earliest modern Homeric scholars started with the same basic approaches towards the Homeric poems as scholars in antiquity. The allegorical interpretation of the Homeric poems that had been so prevalent in antiquity returned to become the prevailing view of the Renaissance. Renaissance humanists praised Homer as the archetypically wise poet, whose writings contain hidden wisdom, disguised through allegory. In western Europe during the Renaissance, Virgil was more widely read than Homer and Homer was often seen through a Virgilian lens. In 1664, contradicting the widespread praise of Homer as the epitome of wisdom, François Hédelin, abbé d'Aubignac wrote a scathing attack on the Homeric poems, declaring that they were incoherent, immoral, tasteless, and without style, that Homer never existed, and that the poems were hastily cobbled together by incompetent editors from unrelated oral songs. Fifty years later, the English scholar Richard Bentley concluded that Homer did exist, but that he was an obscure, prehistoric oral poet whose compositions bear little relation to the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\" as they have been passed down. According to Bentley, Homer \"wrote a Sequel of Songs and Rhapsodies, to be sung by himself for small Earnings and good Cheer at Festivals and other Days of Merriment; the \"Ilias\" he wrote for men, and the \"Odysseis\" for the other Sex. These loose songs were not collected together in the Form of an epic Poem till Pisistratus' time, about 500 Years after.\"\n\nFriedrich August Wolf's \"Prolegomena ad Homerum\", published in 1795, argued that much of the material later incorporated into the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\" was originally composed in the tenth century BC in the form of short, separate oral songs, which passed through oral tradition for roughly four hundred years before being assembled into prototypical versions of the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\" the sixth century BC by literate authors. After being written down, Wolf maintained that the two poems were extensively edited, modernized, and eventually shaped into their present state as artistic unities. Wolf and the \"Analyst\" school, which led the field in the nineteenth century, sought to recover the original, authentic poems which were thought to be concealed by later excrescences. Within the Analyst school were two camps: proponents of the \"lay theory,\" which held that the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\" were put together from a large number of short, independent songs, and proponents of the \"nucleus theory\", which held that Homer had originally composed shorter versions of the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\", which later poets expanded and revised. A small group of scholars opposed to the Analysts, dubbed \"Unitarians\", saw the later additions as superior, the work of a single inspired poet. By around 1830, the central preoccupations of Homeric scholars, dealing with whether or not \"Homer\" actually existed, when and how the Homeric poems originated, how they were transmitted, when and how they were finally written down, and their overall unity, had been dubbed \"the Homeric Question\".\n\nFollowing World War I, the Analyst school began to fall out of favor among Homeric scholars. It did not die out entirely, but it came to be increasingly seen as a discredited dead end. Starting in around 1928, Milman Parry and Albert Lord, after their studies of folk bards in the Balkans, developed the \"Oral-Formulaic Theory\" that the Homeric poems were originally composed through improvised oral performances, which relied on traditional epithets and poetic formulas. This theory found very wide scholarly acceptance and explained many previously puzzling features of the Homeric poems, including their unusually archaic language, their extensive use of stock epithets, and their other \"repetitive\" features. Many scholars concluded that the \"Homeric question\" had finally been answered. Meanwhile, the 'Neoanalysts' sought to bridge the gap between the 'Analysts' and 'Unitarians'. The Neoanalysts sought to trace the relationships between the Homeric poems and other epic poems, which have now been lost, but which modern scholars do possess some patchy knowledge of.\n\nMost contemporary scholars, although they disagree on other questions about the genesis of the poems, agree that the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\" were not produced by the same author, based on \"the many differences of narrative manner, theology, ethics, vocabulary, and geographical perspective, and by the apparently imitative character of certain passages of the \"Odyssey\" in relation to the \"Iliad\".\" Nearly all scholars agree that the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\" are unified poems, in that each poem shows a clear overall design, and that they are not merely strung together from unrelated songs. It is also generally agreed that each poem was composed mostly by a single author, who probably relied heavily on older oral traditions. Nearly all scholars agree that the \"Doloneia\" in Book X of the \"Iliad\" is not part of the original poem, but rather a later insertion by a different poet.\n\nSome ancient scholars believed Homer to have been an eyewitness to the Trojan War; others thought he had lived up to 500 years afterwards. Contemporary scholars continue to debate the date of the poems. A long history of oral transmission lies behind the composition of the poems, complicating the search for a precise date. At one extreme, Richard Janko has proposed a date for both poems to the eighth century BC based on linguistic analysis and statistics. Barry B. Powell dates the composition of the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\" to sometime between 800 and 750 BC, based on the statement from Herodotus, who lived in the late fifth century BC, that Homer lived four hundred years before his own time \"and not more\" (καὶ οὐ πλέοσι), and on the fact that the poems do not mention hoplite battle tactics, inhumation, or literacy. At the other extreme, scholars such as Gregory Nagy see \"Homer\" as a continually evolving tradition, which grew much more stable as the tradition progressed, but which did not fully cease to continue changing and evolving until as late as the middle of the second century BC. Martin Litchfield West has argued that the \"Iliad\" echoes the poetry of Hesiod, and that it must have been composed around 660-650 BC at the earliest, with the \"Odyssey\" up to a generation later. He also interprets passages in the \"Iliad\" as showing knowledge of historical events that occurred in the ancient Near East during the middle of the seventh century BC, including the destruction of Babylon by Sennacherib in 689 BC and the Sack of Thebes by Ashurbanipal in 663/4 BC.\n\n\"'Homer\" is a name of unknown etymological origin, around which many theories were erected in antiquity. One such linkage was to the Greek (\"hómēros\"), \"hostage\" (or \"surety\"). The explanations suggested by modern scholars tend to mirror their position on the overall Homeric question. Nagy interprets it as \"he who fits (the song) together\". West has advanced both possible Greek and Phoenician etymologies.\n\nScholars continue to debate questions such as whether the Trojan War actually took place — and if so when and where — and to what extent the society depicted by Homer is based on his own or one which was, even at the time of the poems' composition, known only as legend. The Homeric epics are largely set in the east and center of the Mediterranean, with some scattered references to Egypt, Ethiopia and other distant lands, in a warlike society that resembles that of the Greek world slightly before the hypothesized date of the poems' composition.\n\nIn ancient Greek chronology, the sack of Troy was dated to 1184 BC. By the nineteenth century, there was widespread scholarly skepticism that Troy or the Trojan War had ever existed, but in 1873 Heinrich Schliemann announced to the world that he had discovered the ruins of Homer's Troy at Hissarlik in modern Turkey. Some contemporary scholars think the destruction of Troy VIIa \"circa\" 1220 BC was the origin of the myth of the Trojan War, others that the poem was inspired by multiple similar sieges that took place over the centuries.\n\nMost scholars now agree that the Homeric poems depict customs and elements of the material world that are derived from different periods of Greek history. For instance, the heroes in the poems use bronze weapons, characteristic of the Bronze Age in which the poems are set, rather than the later Iron Age during which they were composed; yet the same heroes are cremated (an Iron Age practice) rather than buried (as they were in the Bronze Age). In some parts of the Homeric poems, heroes are accurately described as carrying large shields like those used by warriors during the Mycenaean period, but, in other places, they are instead described carrying the smaller shields that were commonly used during the time when the poems were written in the early Iron Age.\n\nIn the \"Iliad\" 10.260-265, Odysseus is described as wearing a helmet made of boar's tusks. Such helmets were not worn in Homer's time, but were commonly worn by aristocratic warriors between 1600 and 1150 BC. The decipherment of Linear B in the 1950s by Michael Ventris and continued archaeological investigation has increased modern scholars' understanding of Aegean civilisation, which in many ways resembles the ancient Near East more than the society described by Homer. Some aspects of the Homeric world are simply made up; for instance, the \"Iliad\" 22.145-56 describes there being two springs that run near the city of Troy, one that runs steaming hot and the other that runs icy cold. It is here that Hector takes his final stand against Achilles. Archaeologists, however, have uncovered no evidence that springs of this description ever actually existed.\n\nThe Homeric epics are written in an artificial literary language or 'Kunstsprache' only used in epic hexameter poetry. Homeric Greek shows features of multiple regional Greek dialects and periods, but is fundamentally based on Ionic Greek, in keeping with the tradition that Homer was from Ionia. Linguistic analysis suggests that the \"Iliad\" was composed slightly before the \"Odyssey\", and that Homeric formulae preserve older features than other parts of the poems.\n\nThe Homeric poems were composed in unrhymed dactylic hexameter; ancient Greek metre was quantity rather than stress-based. Homer frequently uses set phrases such as epithets ('crafty Odysseus', 'rosy-fingered Dawn', 'owl-eyed Athena', etc.), Homeric formulae ('and then answered [him/her], Agamemnon, king of men', 'when the early-born rose-fingered Dawn came to light', 'thus he/she spoke'), simile, type scenes, ring composition and repetition. These habits aid the extemporizing bard, and are characteristic of oral poetry. For instance, the main words of a Homeric sentence are generally placed towards the beginning, whereas literate poets like Virgil or Milton use longer and more complicated syntactical structures. Homer then expands on these ideas in subsequent clauses; this technique is called parataxis.\n\nThe so-called 'type scenes' (\"typischen Scenen\"), were named by Walter Arend in 1933. He noted that Homer often, when describing frequently recurring activities such as eating, praying, fighting and dressing, used blocks of set phrases in sequence that were then elaborated by the poet. The 'Analyst' school had considered these repetitions as un-Homeric, whereas Arend interpreted them philosophically. Parry and Lord noted that these conventions are found in many other cultures.\n\n'Ring composition' or chiastic structure (when a phrase or idea is repeated at both the beginning and end of a story, or a series of such ideas first appears in the order A, B, C... before being reversed as ...C, B, A) has been observed in the Homeric epics. Opinion differs as to whether these occurrences are a conscious artistic device, a mnemonic aid or a spontaneous feature of human storytelling.\n\nBoth of the Homeric poems begin with an invocation to the Muse. In the \"Iliad\", the poet invokes her to sing of \"the anger of Achilles\", and, in the \"Odyssey\", he asks her to sing of \"the man of many ways\". A similar opening was later employed by Virgil in his \"Aeneid\".\n\nThe orally transmitted Homeric poems were put into written form at some point between the eighth and sixth centuries BC. Some scholars believe that they were dictated by the poet; Albert Lord noted that, in the process of dictating, the Balkan bards he recorded revised and extended their lays. Some scholars hypothesize that a similar process occurred when the Homeric poems were first written.\n\nOther scholars such as Gregory Nagy hold that, after the poems were formed in the eight century, they were orally transmitted with little deviation until they were written down in the sixth century. After textualisation, the poems were each divided into 24 rhapsodes, today referred to as books, and labelled by the letters of the Greek alphabet. These divisions probably date from before 200 BC, and may have been made by Homer.\n\nIn antiquity, it was widely held that the Homeric poems were collected and organised in Athens in the late sixth century BC by the tyrant Pesistratos (died 528/7 BC), in what subsequent scholars have dubbed the \"Pesistratean recension\". The idea that the Homeric poems were originally transmitted orally and first written down during the reign of Peisistratos is referenced by the first-century BC Roman orator Cicero and is also referenced in a number of other surviving sources, including two ancient \"Lives of Homer\". From around 150 BC, the texts of the Homeric poems seem to have become relatively established. After the establishment of the Library of Alexandria, Homeric scholars such as Zenodotus of Ephesus, Aristophanes of Byzantium and in particular Aristarchus of Samothrace helped establish a canonical text.\n\nThe first printed edition of Homer was produced in 1488 in Milan. Today scholars use medieval manuscripts, papyri and other sources; some argue for a 'multi-text' view, rather than seeking a single definitive text. The nineteenth-century edition of Arthur Ludwich mainly follows Aristarchus's work, whereas van Thiel's (1991,1996) follows the medieval vulgate. Others, such as Martin West (1998-2000) or T.W. Allen fall somewhere between these two extremes.\n\n</div>\n\n\n\nThis is a partial list of translations into English of Homer's \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3140575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3140575", "title": "Islamic views on slavery", "text": "Islamic views on slavery\n\nIslamic views on slavery represent a complex and multifaceted body of Islamic thought, with various Islamic groups or thinkers espousing views on the matter which have been radically different throughout history. Slavery was a mainstay of life in pre-Islamic Arabia and surrounding lands. It was in this social milieu that Islam emerged, whence the Quran and the \"hadith\" (sayings of Muhammad) address slavery extensively, assuming its existence as part of society but viewing it as an exceptional condition and restricting its scope. Early Islamic dogma forbade enslavement of free members of Islamic society, including non-Muslims (\"dhimmis\"), and set out to improve conditions of human bondage. The sharīʿah (divine law) regarded as legal slaves only those non-Muslims who were imprisoned or bought beyond the borders of Islamic rule, or the sons and daughters of slaves already in captivity. In later classical Islamic law, the topic of slavery is covered at great length. Slaves, be they Muslim or those of any other religion, were equal to their fellow practitioners in religious issues.\n\nIn theory, slavery in Islamic law does not have a racial or color component, although this has not always been the case in practice. Slaves played various social and economic roles, from domestic worker to high-ranking positions in the government like Emir. Moreover, slaves were widely employed in irrigation, mining, pastoralism, and the army. Some rulers even relied on military and administrative slaves to such a degree that they seized power. In some cases, the treatment of slaves was so harsh that it led to uprisings, such as the Zanj Rebellion. However, this was an exception rather than the norm, as the vast majority of labor in the medieval Islamic world consisted of free, paid labour. For a variety of reasons, internal growth of the slave population was not enough to fulfill the demand in Muslim society. This resulted in massive importation, which involved enormous suffering and loss of life from the capture and transportation of slaves from non-Muslim lands.\n\nThe Quran provides for emancipation of a slave as a means of religious atonement for sins.\n\nThe Arab slave trade was most active in West Asia, North Africa, and Southeast Africa. In the early 20th century (post World War I), slavery was gradually outlawed and suppressed in Muslim lands, largely due to pressure exerted by Western nations such as Britain and France. For example, Saudi Arabia and Yemen only abolished slavery in 1962 under pressure from Britain; Oman followed suit in 1970, and Mauritania in 1905, 1981, and again in August 2007. However, slavery claiming the sanction of Islam is documented presently in the predominantly Islamic countries of Chad, Mauritania, Niger, Mali, and Sudan.\n\nMany early converts to Islam were the poor and former slaves. One notable example is Bilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi.\n\nSlavery was widely practiced in pre-Islamic Arabia, as well as in the rest of the ancient and early medieval world. The minority were white slaves of foreign extraction, likely brought in by Arab caravaners (or the product of Bedouin captures) stretching back to biblical times. Native Arab slaves had also existed, a prime example being Zayd ibn Harithah, later to become Muhammad's adopted son. Arab slaves, however, usually obtained as captives, were generally ransomed off amongst nomad tribes. The slave population increased by the custom of child abandonment (see also infanticide), and by the kidnapping, or, occasionally, the sale of small children. There is no conclusive evidence of the existence of enslavement for debt or the sale of children by their families; the late and rare accounts of such occurrences show them to be abnormal, Brunschvig states (According to Brockopp, debt slavery was persistent.) Free persons could sell their offspring, or even themselves, into slavery. Enslavement was also possible as a consequence of committing certain offenses against the law, as in the Roman Empire.\n\nTwo classes of slave existed: a purchased slave, and a slave born in the master's home. Over the latter the master had complete rights of ownership, though these slaves were unlikely to be sold or disposed of by the master. Female slaves were at times forced into prostitution for the benefit of their masters, in accordance with Near Eastern customs.\n\nThe historical accounts of the early years of Islam report that \"slaves of non-Muslim masters ... suffered brutal punishments. Sumayyah bint Khayyat is famous as the first martyr of Islam, having been killed with a spear by Abū Jahl when she refused to give up her faith. Abu Bakr freed Bilal when his master, Umayya ibn Khalaf, placed a heavy rock on his chest in an attempt to force his conversion.\"\n\nThe mainstream view is that the Quran accepts the institution of slavery. It may be noted that the word 'abd' (slave) is rarely used, being more commonly replaced by some periphrasis such as \"ma malakat aymanukum\" (\"that which your right hands own\"). However the meaning and translation of this term has been disputed. W.G. Clarence-Smith has highlighted the point of view of Ghulam Ahmed Pervez on this issue, who argued that the term is used in the past-tense in the Quran, thus signalling only those individuals who were already enslaved at the dawn of Islam. This slight change in tense is significant, as it allowed G.A. Parwez to argue that slavery was never compatible with the commandments of the Quran and is in fact outlawed by Quranic Law.\n\nThe mainstream view; however, is that the Qur'an recognizes the basic inequality between master and slave and the rights of the former over the latter. The historian Brunschvig states that from a spiritual perspective, \"the slave has the same value as the free man, and the same eternity is in store for his soul; in this earthly life, failing emancipation, there remains the fact of his inferior status, to which he must piously resign himself.\"\n\nAccording to Lewis, the Quran urges kindness to the slave and recommends their liberation by purchase or manumission. The freeing of slaves is recommended both for the expiation of sins and as an act of simple benevolence. It exhorts masters to allow slaves to earn or purchase their own freedom (manumission contracts).\"\n\nSlaves are mentioned in at least twenty-nine verses of the Qur'an, most of these are Medinan and refer to the legal status of slaves. The legal material on slavery in the Qur'an is largely restricted to manumission and sexual relations. According to Sikainga, the Qur'anic references to slavery as mainly contain \"broad and general propositions of an ethical nature rather than specific legal formulations.\"\n\nThe Quran accepts the distinction between slave and free as part of the natural order and uses this distinction as an example of God's grace, regarding this discrimination between human beings as in accordance with the divinely established order of things. \"The Qur'an, however, does not consider slaves to be mere chattel; their humanity is directly addressed in references to their beliefs, their desire for manumission and their feelings about being forced into prostitution. In one case, the Qur'an refers to master and slave with the same word, \"rajul\". Later interpreters presume slaves to be spiritual equals of free Muslims. For example, verse 4:25 urges believers to marry 'believing maids that your right hands own' and then states: \"The one of you is as the other,\" which the Jalaalayn interpret as \"You and they are equal in faith, so do not refrain from marrying them.\" The human aspect of slaves is further reinforced by reference to them as members of the private household, sometimes along with wives or children. The Prophet ordered slave-owners to address their slaves by such euphemistic terms as \"my boy\" and \"my girl\" stemmed from the belief that God, not their masters, was responsible for the slave's status.\n\nThere are many common features between the institution of slavery in the Quran and that of neighboring cultures. However, the Quranic institution had some unique new features. Bernard Lewis states that the Qur'anic legislation brought two major changes to ancient slavery which were to have far-reaching effects: presumption of freedom, and the ban on the enslavement of free persons except in strictly defined circumstances. According to Brockopp, the idea of using alms for the manumission of slaves appears to be unique to the Quran, assuming the traditional interpretation of verses and . Similarly, the practice of freeing slaves in atonement for certain sins appears to be introduced by the Quran (but compare Exod 21:26-7). The forced prostitution of female slaves, a Near Eastern custom of great antiquity, is condemned in the Quran. Murray Gordon notes that this ban is \"of no small significance.\" Brockopp writes: \"Other cultures limit a master's right to harm a slave but few exhort masters to treat their slaves kindly, and the placement of slaves in the same category as other weak members of society who deserve protection is unknown outside the Qur'an. The unique contribution of the Qur'an, then, is to be found in its emphasis on the place of slaves in society and society's responsibility toward the slave, perhaps the most progressive legislation on slavery in its time.\"\n\nAccording to Maurice Middleberg, \"Sura 90 in the Quran states that the righteous path involves 'the freeing of slaves.'\"\n\nThe most notable of Muhammad's slaves were: Safiyya bint Huyayy, whom he freed and married; Maria al-Qibtiyya, given to Muhammad by a Sassanid official, whom he freed and who may have become his wife; Sirin, Maria's sister, whom he freed and married to the poet Hassan ibn Thabit and Zayd ibn Harithah, whom Muhammad freed and adopted as a son.\n\nIn Islamic jurisprudence, slavery was an exceptional condition, with the general rule being a presumption of freedom (\"al-'asl huwa 'l-hurriya\" — \"The basic principle is liberty\") for a person if his or her origins were unknown. Lawful enslavement was restricted to two instances: capture in war (on the condition that the prisoner is not a Muslim), or birth in slavery. Islamic law did not recognize the classes of slave from pre-Islamic Arabia including those sold or given into slavery by themselves and others, and those indebted into slavery. Though a free Muslim could not be enslaved, conversion to Islam by a non-Muslim slave did not require that he or she then should be liberated. Slave status was not affected by conversion to Islam.\n\nIn the instance of illness it would be required for the slave to be looked after. Manumission is considered a meritorious act. Based on the Quranic verse (24:33), Islamic law permits a slave to ransom himself upon consent of his master through a contract known as \"mukataba\". Azizah Y. al-Hibri, a professor of Law specializing in Islamic jurisprudence, states that both the Qur'an and Hadith are repeatedly exhorting Muslims to treat the slaves well and that Muhammad showed this both in action and in words. Levy concurs, adding that \"cruelty to them was forbidden.\" Al-Hibri quotes the famous last speech of Muhammad and other hadiths emphasizing that all believers, whether free or enslaved, are siblings. Lewis explains, \"the humanitarian tendency of the Qur'an and the early caliphs in the Islamic empire, was to some extent counteracted by other influences,\" notably the practice of various conquered people and countries Muslims encountered, especially in provinces previously under Roman law. In spite of this, Lewis also states, \"Islamic practice still represented a vast improvement on that inherited from antiquity, from Rome, and from Byzantium.\" Murray Gordon writes: \"It was not surprising that Muhammad, who accepted the existing socio-political order, looked upon slavery as part of the natural order of things. His approach to what was already an age-old institution was reformist and not revolutionary. The Prophet had not in mind to bring about the abolition of slavery. Rather, his purpose was to improve the conditions of slaves by correcting abuses and appealing to the conscience of his followers to treat them humanely.\" The adoption of slaves as members of the family was common, according to Levy. If a slave was born and brought up in the master's household he was never sold, except in exceptional circumstances.\n\nIn Islamic law (Sharia), \"Ma malakat aymanukum\" is the term for slaves or captives of war. The purchase of female slaves for sex was lawful from the perspective of Islamic law, and this was the most common motive for the purchase of slaves throughout Islamic history.\n\nAl-Muminun 6 and Al-Maarij 30 both, in identical wording, draw a distinction between spouses and \"those whom one's right hands possess\", saying \" أَزْوَاجِهِمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُمْ\" (literally, \"their spouses or what their right hands possess\"), while clarifying that sexual intercourse with either is permissible. Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi explains that \"two categories of women have been excluded from the general command of guarding the private parts: (a) wives, (b) women who are legally in one's possession\".\n\nSlave women were required mainly as concubines and menials. A Muslim slaveholder was entitled by law to the sexual enjoyment of his slave women. While free women might own male slaves, they had no such right. The property of a slave was owned by his or her master unless a contract of freedom of the slave had been entered into, which allowed the slave to earn money to purchase his or her freedom and similarly to pay bride wealth. The marriage of slaves required the consent of the owner. Under the Hanafi and Shafi'i schools of jurisprudence male slaves could marry two wives, but the Maliki permitted them to marry four wives like the free men. According to the Islamic law, a male slave could marry a free woman but this was discouraged in practice. Islam permits sexual relations between a male master and his female slave outside marriage. This is referred to in the Qur'an as \"ma malakat aymanukum\" or \"what your right hands possess\". There are some restrictions on the master; he may not co-habit with a female slave belonging to his wife, neither can he have relations with a female slave if she is co-owned, or already married.\n\nIn ancient Arabian custom, the child of a freeman by his slave was also a slave unless he was recognized and liberated by his father. In theory, the recognition by a master of his offspring by a slave woman was optional in Islamic society, and in the early period was often withheld. By the High Middle Ages it became normal and was unremarkable in a society where the sovereigns themselves were almost invariably the children of slave concubines. The mother receives the title of \"umm walad\" (\"lit\". mother of a child), which is an improvement in her status as she can no longer be sold. Among Sunnis, she is automatically freed upon her master's death, however for Shi'a, she is only freed if her child is still alive; her value is then deducted from this child's share of the inheritance. Lovejoy writes that as an \"umm walad\", they attained \"an intermediate position between slave and free\" pending their freedom, although they would sometimes be nominally freed as soon as they gave birth.\n\nThere is no limit on the number of concubines a master may possess. However, the general marital laws are to be observed, such as not having sexual relations with the sister of a female slave. In Islam, \"men are enjoined to marry free women in the first instance, but if they cannot afford the bridewealth for free women, they are told to marry slave women rather than engage in wrongful acts.\" One rationale given for recognition of concubinage in Islam is that \"it satisfied the sexual desire of the female slaves and thereby prevented the spread of immorality in the Muslim community.\" A slave master could have sex with his female slave only while she was not married. This attempt to require sexual exclusivity for female slaves was rare in antiquity, when female slaves generally had no claim to an exclusive sexual relationship. According to Sikainga, \"in reality, however, female slaves in many Muslim societies were prey for members of their owners' household, their neighbors, and their guests.\"\n\nIn Shiite jurisprudence it is unlawful for a master of a female slave to grant a third party the use of her for sexual relations. The Shiite scholar Shaykh al-Tusi stated:ولا يجوز إعارتها للاستمتاع بها لأن البضع لا يستباح بالإعارة\n\"It is not permissible to loan (the slave girl) for enjoyment purpose, because sexual intercourse cannot be legitimate through loaning\" and the Shiite scholars al-Muhaqiq al-Kurki, Allamah al-Hilli and Ali Asghar Merwarid made the following ruling: ولا تجوز استعارة الجواري للاستمتاع\n\"It is not permissible to loan the slave girl for the purpose of sexual intercourse\"\n\nUnder the legal doctrine of \"kafa'a\"(lit.\"efficiency\"), the purpose of which was to ensure that a man should be at least the social equal of the woman he marries, a freedman is not as good as the son of a freedman, and he in turn not as good as the grandson of a freedman. This principle is pursued up to three generations, after which all Muslims are deemed equally free. Lewis asserts that since kafa'a \"does not forbid unequal marriages\", it is in no sense a \"Muslim equivalent of Nuremberg Laws of Nazi Germany or the apartheid laws of South Africa. His purpose, he states, is not to try to set up a moral competition - to compare castration and apartheid as offenses against humanity.\"\n\nWithin Islamic jurisprudence, slaves were excluded from religious office and from any office involving jurisdiction over others. Freed slaves are able to occupy any office within the Islamic government, and instances of this in history include the Mamluk who ruled Egypt for almost 260 years and the eunuchs who have held military and administrative positions of note. With the permission of their owners they are able to marry. Annemarie Schimmel, a contemporary scholar on Islamic civilization, asserts that because the status of slaves under Islam could only be obtained through either being a prisoner of war (this was soon restricted only to infidels captured in a holy war) or born from slave parents, slavery would be theoretically abolished with the expansion of Islam. Fazlur Rahman agrees, stating that the Qur'anic acceptance of the institution of slavery on the legal plane was the only practical option available at the time of Muhammad since \"slavery was ingrained in the structure of society, and its overnight wholesale liquidation would have created problems which it would have been absolutely impossible to solve, and only a dreamer could have issued such a visionary statement.\" Islam's reforms stipulating the conditions of enslavement seriously limited the supply of new slaves. Murray Gordon does note: \"Muhammad took pains in urging the faithful to free their slaves as a way of expiating their sins. Some Muslim scholars have taken this mean that his true motive was to bring about a gradual elimination of slavery. An alternative argument is that by lending the moral authority of Islam to slavery, Muhammad assured its legitimacy. Thus, in lightening the fetter, he riveted it ever more firmly in place.\" In the early days of Islam, a plentiful supply of new slaves were brought due to rapid conquest and expansion. But as the frontiers were gradually stabilized, this supply dwindled to a mere trickle. The prisoners of later wars between Muslims and Christians were commonly ransomed or exchanged.\n\nAccording to Lewis, this reduction resulted in Arabs who wanted slaves having to look elsewhere to avoid the restrictions in the Qur'an, meaning an increase of importing of slaves from non-Muslim lands, primarily from Africa. These slaves suffered a high death toll. Patrick Manning states that Islamic legislations against the abuse of the slaves convincingly limited the extent of enslavement in Arabian Peninsula and to a lesser degree for the whole area of the whole Umayyad Caliphate where slavery had existed since the most ancient times. He however notes that with the passage of time and the extension of Islam, Islam by recognizing and codifying slavery seems to have done more to protect and expand slavery than the reverse.\n\nIn theory free-born Muslims could not be enslaved, and the only way that a non-Muslim could be enslaved was being captured in the course of holy war. (In early Islam, neither a Muslim nor a Christian or Jew could be enslaved.) Slavery was also perceived as a means of converting non-Muslims to Islam: A task of the masters was religious instruction. Conversion and assimilation into the society of the master didn't automatically lead to emancipation, though there was normally some guarantee of better treatment and was deemed a prerequisite for emancipation. The majority of Sunni authorities approved the manumission of all the \"People of the Book\". According to some jurists -especially among the Shi'a- only Muslim slaves should be liberated. In practice, traditional propagators of Islam in Africa often revealed a cautious attitude towards proselytizing because of its effect in reducing the potential reservoir of slaves.\n\n\"Morally as well as physically the slave is regarded in law as an inferior being,\" Levy writes. Under Islamic law, a slave possesses a composite quality of being both a person and a possession. The slave is entitled to receive sustenance from the master, which includes shelter, food, clothing, and medical attention. It is a requirement for this sustenance to be of the same standard generally found in the locality and it is also recommended for the slave to have the same standard of food and clothing as the master. If the master refuses to provide the required sustenance, the slave may complain to a judge, who may then penalize the master through sale of her or his goods as necessary for the slave's keep. If the master does not have sufficient wealth to facilitate this, she or he must either sell, hire out, or manumit the slave as ordered. Slaves also have the right to a period of rest during the hottest parts of the day during the summer.\n\nEvidence from slaves is rarely viable in a court of law. As slaves are regarded as inferior in Islamic law, death at the hands of a free man does not require that the latter be killed in retaliation. The killer must pay the slave's master compensation equivalent to the slave's value, as opposed to blood-money. At the same time, slaves themselves possess a lessened responsibility for their actions, and receive half the penalty required upon a free man. For example: where a free man would be subject to a hundred lashes due to pre-marital relations, a slave would be subject to only fifty. Slaves are allowed to marry only with the owner's consent. Jurists differ over how many wives a slave may possess, with the Hanafi and Shafi'i schools allowing them two, and the Maliki school allowing four. Slaves are not permitted to possess or inherit property, or conduct independent business, and may conduct financial dealings only as a representative of the master. Offices of authority are generally not permitted for slaves, though a slave may act as the leader (\"Imam\") in the congregational prayers, and he may also act as a subordinate officer in the governmental department of revenue. Masters may sell, bequeath, give away, pledge, hire out or compel them to earn money.\n\nBy the view of some madh'hab (but not others), a master may compel his/her slave(s) to marriage and determine the identity of their marriage partner(s)\n\nThe mahr that is given for marriage to a female slave is taken by her owner, whereas all other women possess it absolutely for themselves\n\nThe Qur'an and Hadith, the primary Islamic texts, make it a praiseworthy act for masters to set their slaves free. There are numerous ways in which a slave may become free. One way is through expiation for certain sins committed by the master, such as involuntary manslaughter or perjury. Other ways include emancipation through becoming an \"umm walad\", who is freed upon her master's death along with her children, or an independent act of piety by the master, as recommended by the Quran. It is also commendable to manumit a slave who demands his freedom and is considered worthy of it; however, Richard Francis Burton states in a footnote to the \"Tale of the Second Eunuch\", commenting on the proposed emancipation of a slave without employable skills, that \"Here the slave refuses to be set free and starve. For a master so to do without ample reasons is held disgraceful. I well remember the weeping and wailing throughout Sind when an order from Sir Charles Napier set free the negroes whom British philanthropy thus doomed to endure if not to die of hunger.\" Another method is the \"mukataba\" contract: Levy states that \"the slave may redeem himself if his master agrees and contracts to let him go on payment of a stipulated sum of money, which may be paid in two or more instalments, or on the giving of stipulated services or other consideration. If the consideration is a sum of money, the master must grant the slave the right to earn and to own property.\"\n\nIf the master makes a declaration of the slave's freedom, whether in jest or earnest, in the presence of the slave or another, then such a declaration becomes legally binding. Similarly, the master may promise manumission (verbally or in writing) that the slave is to be freed upon the former's death. Lastly, a slave is also freed automatically if she or he comes into the possession of a master who is directly related to her or him.\n\nGordon opines that the Quran in particular and Islamic jurisprudence in general have not placed a premium on manumission but held it out as one way for atonement of sin. He states that \"Manumission was only one of several virtuous observances that the pious could avail themselves of and was by no means the most important,\" noting that other options include reaffirming faith in God and giving food to the poor. He concludes that \"there was no contradiction between being a devout Muslim and a slave-owing one as well.\"\n\nThe abolition movement starting in the 19th century in England and later in other Western countries influenced the slavery in Muslim lands both in doctrine and in practice. One of the first religious decrees comes from the two highest dignitaries of the Hanafi and Maliki rites in the Ottoman Empire. These religious authorities declared that slavery is lawful in principle but it is regrettable in its consequences. They expressed two religious considerations in their support for abolition of slavery: \"the initial enslaving of the people concerned comes under suspicion of illegality by reason of the present-day expansion of Islam in their countries; masters no longer comply with the rules of good treatment which regulate their rights and shelter them from wrong-doing.\"\n\nAccording to Brunschvig, although the total abolition of slavery might seem a reprehensible innovation and contrary to the Qur'an and the practice of early Muslims, the realities of the modern world caused a \"discernible evolution in the thought of many educated Muslims before the end of the 19th century.\" These Muslims argued that Islam on the whole has \"bestowed an exceptionally favourable lot on the victims of slavery\" and that the institution of slavery is linked to the particular economic and social stage in which Islam originated. According to the influential thesis of Ameer Ali, Islam only tolerated slavery through temporary necessity and that its complete abolition was not possible at the time of Muhammad.\n\nAccording to Brockopp, some modern interpreters have accused the medieval interpreters of having subverted the Qur'an's demand for manumission contracts (see Mukataba). They have used the dramatic change in the institution of slavery in the 7th and 8th centuries to argue that the Qur'an would not have condoned the slaving practices common in Islamic history. Others have argued that the original intent of the Qur'an, when understood properly, was to abolish slavery altogether.\n\nThe idea that Islam only tolerated slavery due to necessity has to some extent found its way into the circle of the Ulema. It has been unable to gain support among the Wahhabis.\n\nEarlier in the 20th century, prior to the \"reopening\" of slavery by Salafi scholars like Shaykh al-Fawzan, Islamist authors declared slavery outdated without actually clearly affirming and promoting its abolition. This has caused at least one scholar (William Clarence-Smith) to bemoan the \"dogged refusal of Mawlana Mawdudi to give up on slavery\" and the notable \"evasions and silences of Muhammad Qutb\".\n\nSayyid Qutb, the scholar of the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood said in his exegesis (\"Tafsir\") of the Quran:\nAnd concerning slavery, that was when slavery was a world-wide structure and which was conducted amongst Muslims and their enemies in the form of enslaving of prisoners of war. And it was necessary for Islam to adopt a similar line of practise until the world devised a new code of practise during war other than enslavement. \n\nQutb's brother Muhammad Qutb contrasted sexual relations between Muslim slave-owners and their female slaves with (in his view), the widespread and depraved practice of casual consensual sex in contemporary Europe:\n\nIslam made it lawful for a master to have a number of slave-women captured in wars and enjoined that he alone may have sexual relations with them ... Europe abhors this law but at the same gladly allows that most odious form of animalism according to which a man may have illicit relations with any girl coming across him on his way to gratify his animal passions.\n\nAbul A'la Maududi of Jamaat-e-Islami has said: Islam has clearly and categorically forbidden the primitive practice of capturing a free man, to make him a slave or to sell him into slavery. On this point the clear and unequivocal words of Muhammad are as follows:\"There are three categories of people against whom I shall myself be a plaintiff on the Day of Judgement. Of these three, one is he who enslaves a free man, then sells him and eats this money\" (al-Bukhari and Ibn Majjah). The words of this Tradition of the Prophet are also general, they have not been qualified or made applicable to a particular nation, race, country or followers of a particular religion. ... After this the only form of slavery which was left in Islamic society was the prisoners of war, who were captured on the battlefield. These prisoners of war were retained by the Muslim Government until their government agreed to receive them back in exchange for Muslim soldiers captured by them ... \nTaqiuddin al-Nabhani, a shariah judge and founder of Hizb ut-Tahrir movement, gives the following explanation:\nWhen Islam came, for the situations where people were taken into slavery (e.g. debt), Islam imposed Shari’ah solutions to those situations other than slavery. ... It (Islam) made the existing slave and owner form a business contract, based upon the freedom, not upon slavery ... As for the situation of war, ... it clarified the rule of the captive in that either they are favoured by releasing without any exchange, or they are ransomed for money or exchanged for Muslims or non-Muslim citizens of the Caliphate. The website of the organization stresses that because sharia historically was responding to a contract, not the institution of slavery, a future Khilafah could not re-introduce slavery.\n\nWhile prominent clerics of Twelver Shia Islam have joined in declarations against contemporary slavery, \nat least one powerful Shi'a Islamist ayatollah (Mohammad-Taqi Mesbah-Yazdi, a member of Iran's Assembly of Experts, \nthe body responsible for choosing the Supreme Leader of Iran) has made several statements declaring the permissibility of slavery in modern times. \nIn a 2006 interview he stated, \nToday, too, if there's a war between us and the infidels, we'll take slaves. The ruling on slavery hasn't expired and is eternal. We'll take slaves and we'll bring them to the world of Islam and have them stay with Muslims. We'll guide them, make them Muslims and then return them to their countries.\nIn response to the Nigerian extremist group Boko Haram's Quranic justification for kidnapping and enslaving people, and ISIL's religious justification for enslaving Yazidi women as spoils of war as claimed in their digital magazine \"Dabiq\", the 126 Islamic scholars from around the Muslim world, in late September 2014, signed an open letter to the Islamic State's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, rejecting his group's interpretations of the Qur'an and hadith to justify its actions. The letter accuses the group of instigating fitna – sedition – by instituting slavery under its rule in contravention of the anti-slavery consensus of the Islamic scholarly community.\n\nIn recent years, according to some scholars, there has been a \"reopening\" of the issue of slavery by some conservative Salafi Islamic scholars after its \"closing\" earlier in the 20th century when Muslim countries banned slavery and \"most Muslim scholars\" found the practice \"inconsistent with Qur'anic morality.\"\n\nA controversial high-level Saudi jurist, Shaykh Saleh Al-Fawzan, said in a lecture, \"Slavery is a part of Islam. Slavery is part of jihad, and jihad will remain as long there is Islam.\"\nHe further dismissed Muslim writers who maintained otherwise as ignorant and \"blind followers\". At the time of the fatwa, al-Fawzan was a member of the Senior Council of Clerics, Saudi Arabia's highest religious body, a member of the Council of Religious Edicts and Research, the Imam of Prince Mitaeb Mosque in Riyadh, and a professor at Imam Mohamed Bin Saud Islamic University, the main Wahhabi center of learning in the country. Another prominent Saudi cleric, Saad Al-Buraik has urged Palestinians to enslave women of \"the Jews\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

Care must sometimes be taken to distinguish these types of lines from the extremely unusual and non-traditional use of lines as charges, and to distinguish these shapes from actual charges, such as \"a mount [or triple mount] in base,\" or, particularly in German heraldry, different kinds of embattled from castle walls.\n\nIn Scotland, varied lines of partition are often used to modify a bordure (or sometimes another ordinary) to difference the arms of a cadet from the chief of the house.\n\nAn ordinary \"indented\" is bounded by small zigzags like a triangle wave, with peaks on one side matching peaks on the other. An ordinary \"dancetty\" is similar, but with peaks matching troughs, so that the width is constant; it also typically has fewer points than \"indented\". In early armory these were not distinguished. In the arms of the 55th Electronic Combat Group of the United States Air Force the indented is \"edged wider on the back angle (sinister) than on the face (dexter) of each angle\".\n\n\"Dentilly\" is a modern invention, similar to \"indented\", but with one of the sides of the points perpendicular and the other angled, as in a sawtooth wave.\n\n\"Rayonné\" (also \"rayonne\", \"rayonny\"; from French \"rayonner\") may be considered a variant of indented, but with wavy instead of straight lines, as in the conventional representation of rays of the sun. \"Rayonne palewise\" appears in the arms of the 172d Support Battalion of the United States Army.

The arms of the French department of Côtes d'Armor show \"émanché,\" which would be equivalent to the English \"per fess dancetty of two full points upwards.\" The arms of Baron Griffiths of Fforestfach are \"Paly of four Vert and Argent per fess enhanced indented of two points upwards each point double barbed throughout issuing in base a pile double barbed throughout all counterchanged\". The arms of Alaric John Martin Woodrow show an example of \"barry dancetty each point double barbed\", used to represent a line of fir trees as a play on the surname. The arms of the Free State in South Africa show \"a chief dancetty, the peaks terminating in merlons,\" and so might be called a combination of dancetty and embattled; a similar hybrid can be seen in the arms of the Agricultural Gymnasium. Hoerskool Hangklip provide an example of \"dancetty with points flattened\", and Blouberg of \"dancetty the peaks couped.\" It is difficult to know whether to characterise the \"wall-like extremity with five merlons and four embrasures\" in the arms of the Kurgan Oblast in Russia as a divided field or a charge.\n\nThe arms of Ernest John Altobello show a chevronel with the upper edge \"grady\" (this is identical in appearance to indented) \"and ensigned of a tower Argent\".\n\nA line \"wavy\" (also called \"undy\") is a sine wave, often used to represent water; a line \"nebuly\" is similar but with more exaggerated meanders, representing clouds. There are confusing, ambiguous and non-standard uses of \"a wavy\" in the military heraldry of the United States to refer to irregularly wavy lines.\n\nThe wavy chief in the arms of Lord Nelson was blazoned as \"undulated\".\n\nThe field of the arms of the 40th Finance Battalion of the United States Army is blazoned \"per fess wavy (in the manner of a Taeguk)\" The chief in the arms of Professor S.W. Haines is \"wavy of one crest and depressed in the centre of one point\".\n\nIn \"wavy crested\" the waves appear like pointed breakers.\n\nThe arms of James Hill show an example of barrulets \"wavy crested to the sinister on the upper edge\". There are examples of even greater complexity and specificity in the \"wavy\" line, such as the arms of \"Baron Nolan ... [which include] three 'bars wavy couped composed of two troughs and a wave invected of one point on the upper edge and engrailed of one point on the lower edge'\".\n\nSpecification of the number of \"undulations\" in nebuly can be seen by Jochen Wilke's roundel, with ten. (It is uncommon for lines of partition to modify a charge other than an ordinary.)\n\nThese lines consist of a series of circular arcs curving in the same direction, meeting at angles, forming points outward (\"engrailed\") or inward (\"invected\"). When these terms are applied to a partition rather than to an ordinary, the first part of the field is the \"interior\".\n\nThe arms of Liverpool Hope University include \"a Cross engrailed of one point on each limb\". The Flag of Flintshire is \"Argent a cross engrailed sable between four Cornish choughs proper\".\nThe arms of the Pretoria Philatelic Society show a \"chief engrailed and couped\", having the appearance of the edge of a perforated postage stamp. The arms of Kutlwanong Dorp in South Africa provide an example both of the specification of the number of lobes in invected, and those lobes being \"trefly.\"\n\nA line \"embattled\" is a square wave, representing the battlements of a castle.\n\nWhen a fess is embattled, only the topmost edge is altered (as in the arms of Muri bei Bern). If both edges are to be embattled, the term \"embattled-counter-embattled\" (or \"counter-embattled,\" as in the arms of Sir Cecil Denniston Burney) is used. In this case the lines are parallel. If gaps face gaps, the term \"bretessé\" is used. There is at least one emblazonment suggesting that the orle is only embattled on its outer edge.\n\nItalian armory has a variant, Ghibelline battlement, with notched merlons.\nIn a line \"raguly\" the extensions are oblique rather than orthogonal, like the stumps of limbs protruding from a tree-trunk.\n\n\"Dovetailed\" is as in carpentry. Unlike embattled, gaps face gaps.\n\n\"Potenty\" may be considered a variant in which the points are extended to \"T\"-shapes (\"potent\" means a crutch).\n\nA line \"embattled grady\" or \"battled embattled\" consists of series of two or three steps, as if each merlon has a smaller merlon atop it. Parker's glossary says that \"double-embattled\" may be the same as this.\n\nThe arms of Schellenberg, in Liechtenstein, provide an example of embattled \"with three battlements.\" The bordure in the arms of Boissy l'Aillerie, in Val d'Oise, France, has nine battlements (and the bordure is also masoned and contains doorlike openings).\n\nA very unusual occurrence of embattled occurs in the arms of the 136th Military Police Battalion of the United States Army: \"Sable, a fesse enhanced and embattled Or, overall a magnifying glass palewise rim Argent (Silver Gray), the glass surmounting and enlarging the middle crenel between two merlons, the handle Gules edged of the second bearing a mullet Argent.\"\n\nThe arms of Baron Kirkwood show two chevronels \"round embattled\" (the merlons are rounded rather than squares). There are also examples of \"embattled pointed\" and \"embattled in the form of mine dumps\".\n\nJames Parker cites the arms of Christopher Draisfield: \"Gules, a chevron raguly of two bastons couped at the top argent.\"\n\nThe arms of Zodwa Special School for Severely Mentally Handicapped Children show a chevron dovetailed, the peak ensigned with a potent issuant\".\n\nSome examples also exist of \"urdy,\" where the line is in the shapes of the upside-down and rightside-up \"shields\" of vair (this is to be distinguished from \"couped urdy\", in which the couping takes a pointed form ). The arms of Winfried Paul Reinhold Steinhagen are \"Per chevron, the peak in the form of a merlon round urdy of four, Gules and Or, in chief a horse forcene and a goat clymant respecting one another, Argent, and in base a bull's head Sable armed Argent; a chief per fess in the form of a wall with three watchtowers, Azure and Argent, the latter charged with a strand of barbed wire throughout, Sable\". The \"unusual, if not unique\" arms of Lourens Du Toit are \"Per fess of three pallets urdy Sable and Or\".\n\nThe arms of the Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons have a bordure emblazoned \"dentate,\" although this appears to be quite similar to dovetailed.\n\nA line \"embowed\" consists of a single arch.\n\nA line \"nowy\" contains a semicircular protuberance in the middle. A line with an angular protuberance in the middle, like a battlement, is called \"escartelly\".\n\nThe arms of Laerskool Bosveld in South Africa have a field \"Per chevron embowed trefly, Azure and Argent\".\n\nThe arms of Léopold-Henri Amyot show \"per fess ogivy\"; this is based on the ogive or pointed arch.\n\nChiefs, fesses and palar dividing lines are sometimes seen \"arched\" and \"double-arched\" (and there is an example of triple-arched), though there is some debate as to whether or not these are lines of partition. That arched can be combined with partition lines can be seen from the arms of South Lanarkshire in Scotland. Arched can also be \"reversed\".\n\nThe rare line \"bevilled\" modifies the bendlets in the arms of Thomas Roy Barnes and the pairle in the arms of Rovaniemi, Finland. This lightning-bolt type of line with one zigzag is to be distinguished from \"angled\", in which the line takes a 90-degree upwards turn before another 90-degree turn, continuing parallel and in the same direction from the old line. There is a South African example of \"bevilled to sinister\", and a bend \"double bevilled\" can be seen in the arms of Philip Kushlick School.\n\nA line \"trefly\" shows protuberances in the form of trefoils.\n\nThe arms of St. Paul's Cathedral in Regina, Saskatchewan contain a bordure \"its inner line looping in foils of poplar of the field within the bordure at each angle and at regular intervals between\".\n\nThe arms of Carmichael show a fess \"wreathy,\" which may or may not be strictly speaking a line of partition, but it does modify the fess; the coat is not blazoned as a \"wreath in fess\". James Parker calls this \"tortilly.\"\n\nThe 20th century saw some innovations in lines of partition. \"Erablé\", a series of alternating upside-down and rightside-up maple-leaves, is a typically Canadian line of partition, though the College of Arms in London has used it in a few grants (but compare the cross \"nowy erablé\" in the arms of Katherina Fahlman Selinger Schaaf. A Finnish line of partition, invented by Kaj Cajander and called \"kuusikoro,\" which is called \"fir-tree topped\" in Britain, and which the Canadian Heraldic Authority coined the term \"sapiné\" to blazon, resembles fir trees; in the arms of Guy Selvester this is called \"sapinage\". A line resembling fir twigs, and so called in British blazon, is called \"sapinagy\" in Canada (though sadly there is no example of it in the online Canadian Public Register), and \"havukoro\" in Finland.) Other 20th-century examples of lines, or things akin to lines, include the 1990 grant to Albersdorf-Prebuch, also in Austria, in which the upper line of the fess takes the form of fruit, the bottom of vine-leaves. (It is debatable what the distinction is between such lines, and examples such as the arms of Bierbaum am Auersbach, a town in Styria, in which three pears grow from a pall.)\n\nThe South African Bureau of Heraldry has developed the line of partition \"serpentine\"(which has also been called 'ondoyant'), which is rather like wavy, but with only one \"wave\", one complete cycle of a sine wave; the serpentine in the arms of the Mtubatuba Primary School is defined as \"dexter to chief and sinister to base\". (Similar is the German \"im Schlangenschnitt\" (snake-wise).) It has also developed the uniquely South-African lines of division (which can also form the ends of a charge) \"nowy of a Cape Town gable\" (now called just \"nowy gabled\"), and \"nowy of an Indian cupola.\" Similarly, the fess line in the arms of the Council for Social and Associated Workers is \"nowy of a trimount inverted\", the fess in the arms of Mossel Bay is \"nowy of two Karoo gable houses\", the chief in the arms of the Lenasia South-East Management Committee is \"nowy of an Indian cupola\", the chief in the arms of the Genealogical Society of South Africa is \"double nowy gably\" and that of Frederick Brownell is \"gably of three\". The arms of the Reyneke Bond (i.e. Reyneke Family Association) are \"Per fess, in each flank double nowy fitchy to base, Azure and Or, a lion rampant per fess of the second and Gules, a chief Or\". The plain chief identifies these as the arms of a family association. The arms of Itsokolele, South Africa include \"a chief double fitchy inverted\".\n\n\"Broad fitchy couped\" is a line of South-African origin similar in appearance to a mine-dump or escartelly with sloping sides.\n\nChevrons can be topped with a fleur-de-lys, and ordinaries with non-straight edges (particularly if they are dancetty or engrailed) can have the points topped with demi fleurs-de-lys. It has sometimes been said that in some reference works flory-counter-flory (and flory) is treated like a line of partition, even though strictly speaking it is not – though it has been used for centuries that way in the royal arms of Scotland blazoning the double tressure (Public Register of Arms, Lyon Court, Edinburgh) and used by the College of arms in blazoning coats like that of Sutherland of Dunstanburgh Castle (Gules, a chevron flory-counterflory between in chief three mullets and in base a lymphad all or) and is used by the South African Bureau of Heraldry blazoning the coat of Huis Tankotie of the University of Pretoria (Per fess, flory counter-flory, Argent and Azure, in base within the flower an annulet Sable; a bordure counterchanged)and Emmanuel-Opleidingsentrum in the South African Bureau of Heraldry's online database. (Flory is sometimes varied with other shapes than the fleur-de-lys, when it is blazoned as \"flory of\".)\n\nA vague and unhelpful blazon of the 27th Air Division of the United States Air Force provides for a \"bordure of distinctive outline\".\n\nEach shield is \"Per fess _______ argent and gules\", but some of these lines have no common English name.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17042559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17042559", "title": "Mese (Constantinople)", "text": "Mese (Constantinople)\n\nThe Mese ( \"i Mése [Odós]\", lit. \"Middle [Street]\") was the main thoroughfare of ancient Constantinople. The street was the main scene of Byzantine imperial processions. Its ancient course is largely followed by the modern Divanyolu Avenue.\n\nThe \"Mese\" started at the Milion monument, close to the Hagia Sophia, and led straight westwards. It passed the Hippodrome and the palaces of Lausos and Antiochus, and after ca. 600 meters reached the oval-shaped Forum of Constantine where one of the city's two Senate houses stood. This stretch of the street was also known as the Regia (, \"Imperial Road\"), as it formed the original ceremonial route from the Great Palace and the Augustaion square to the forum of the city's founder.\n\nFrom there, the street continued to the square Forum of Theodosius or Forum of the Bull (\"Forum Tauri\"), as it was also known. In about the middle of this stretch, the great mall known as \"Makros Embolos\" joined the \"Mese\". At their junction stood a \"tetrapylon\" known as the \"Anemodoulion\" (\"Servant of the winds\").\n\nShortly after it passed the Theodosian Forum, the street divided in two branches at the site of the Capitolium: one branch going northwest, passing by the Church of the Holy Apostles, towards the Gate of Polyandrion, while the other continued southwest, through the Forum of the Ox (Forum Bovis) and the Forum of Arcadius towards the Golden Gate, where it joined the \"Via Egnatia\".\n\nThe \"Mese\" was 25 metres wide and lined with colonnaded porticoes which housed shops. The \"Mese\" was the route followed by imperial processions through the city at least until Comnenian times. The most characteristic was the triumphal entry of a victorious emperor, who entered the city through the Golden Gate and followed the \"Mese\" to the Great Palace, while jubilant crowds lined along the street would greet him and the imperial army back home.\n\n"}

{"id": "56930949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56930949", "title": "Myrlande Constant", "text": "Myrlande Constant\n\nMyrlande Constant is a Haitian and Vodou artist who was born in 1968. Constant is married and the mother of four children.\n\nConstant was born in Port-au-Prince in Haiti where, as a teenager, she learned the art of beading while working with her mother in a Port-au-Prince factory making wedding dresses. Once she quit that job she moved on to be one of the most celebrated artists for making Vodou drapo. Constant has taken part in the revolution in the art of drapo-making over the last two decades. She has been making flags since the 1900s. Since the 1900s, there was an abrupt shift in drapo-making, which was primarily a male art form. There are several new designers who are women now, one of them being Myrlande Constant. Because of the impact that Constant has on other people, she influences art making in other individuals, in particular Marilyn Houlberg.\n\nConstant bears witness to her nation's calamities. For example, after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010, the artwork Myrlande made represented the collectivistic society through the things that were going on at the time.\n\nHer works are densely beaded flags (some as large as six by seven feet). Constant’s flags are much larger than traditional flags. In 2011, Constant participated in a series of exhibitions, workshops, and lectures at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island where she conducted a three-day flag-making workshop.\n\nMyrlande Constant had her first sale to Richard A Morse, who was the manager of the Oloffson Hotel in Port-au-Prince. Other subsequent sales of her outstanding Vodou flags were made through the connections of her husband, Charles, who convinced customers and visitors at the hotel to buy her work. Many of Constant’s inspiration of her artwork came from her father who is a Vodou priest and Christian. She states that she has no one to thank but the spirits and God before the spirits. She additionally states that the mystical feelings and aspirations come from her thoughts. Everything she puts on a flag is there for a reason because the spirit keeps her working. Constant is also inspired by Milo Rigaud’s landmark book called \"Veve\". This book contains symbolic drawings of spirits made on Vodou temple floors. Constant uses that inspiration to remember her memories of Vodou ceremonies and knowledge of the spirits to create her own design in the flags.\n\nThe main process of the making of her flags starts with pencil drawings on white cloth. Second, she sews the sequins and beads to the cloth. Lastly, she incorporates the colors that associate with the spirits. Typically, most of her works are as large as bedspreads depicting various significant events in Vodou and Haitian history through using needle, thread, cloth, and tiny adornments.\n\nConstant is particularly a well known Haitian and Vodou artist in many parts of the world. Specifically, her piece of the 2010 Haiti earthquake apocalypse was recognized as an immediate potential for becoming one of the 2011 Ghetto Biennale Exhibition in New York’s most extreme and powerful artistic visions.\n\nHaiti madi 12 januye 2010 (Haiti Tuesday, January 12, 2010)\n\n239 x 249 cm\n\nPrivate collection\n\nThis piece of artwork is made with fabric, beads, and sequins. Myrlande Constant’s tableau depicts the ruins and aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. It was funded by the Fowler Museum with funds provided by the Fay Bettye Green Fund to Commission New Work. This piece makes the viewer feel the need to study the miseries and disasters that happen in the human life. The chaoticness of the imagery resembles how chaotic the actual event was in 2010. The visual characteristics include a border of crossbones and skulls, and angels and God looking down on the situation resembling the prophet Ezekiel’s vision of dry bones: “The hand of the Lord was on me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the Lord and set me in the middle of the valley, it was full of bones. Ezekiel 37:1).” Other aspects of this piece include homes, churches, and vodou temples all being reduced to rubble. Dogs and pigs gnaw on the unburied unprotected human remains. The Catholic Archbishop Serge Miot, who is a man of God, lies dead under the fallen roof of his cathedral with a hand on a bible. Other individuals in the piece are shown as Vodouists who either carry a child in their arms, or wheelbarrow the dead and wounded to the appropriate destinations as a summoning mortal to the hand of their maker in the call of Gabriel. More individuals either pick up the ruins, or sink to the ground as if remaining upright on solid earth is not an option. Constant’s piece depicted a meaning that explained the suffering as ultimately, just as with life, letting death go on. Looking forward to Ash Wednesday being faithful, and having anticipation on Eastertide’s Resurrection were things that Constant reminded the victims of. The victims were shown “Remember that thou art dust, and to dust thou shalt return”. And so, too the Gede will rise up to their feet, shake off the dirt, adjust their glasses, straighten their hats, grab their canes and crutches, and dance.\n\n\"La Sirene,\" 2002\n\n31’’ x 51’’\n\nPrivate collection\n\nThe La Sirene is made with beads, sequins, and faux pearls on satin. This flag depicts a coquettish spirit who glides through the sea holding flowers, and a handheld mirror close by. There is a legend that states the spirit pulls women under water to get the transformational gift of healing power.\n\n\"Simbi Andezo\", 1996\n\n36.5’’ x 34.5’’\n\nPrivate collection\n\nThe Simbi Andezo is made of beads and faux pearls on satin. The image dramatically depicts a male \"Iwa\" as a regal female in a white gown. There are flowers that fall from her hands. Simbi is seen as a healer who uses plants for the healing of medicine, which also represents the power of water.\n\nCarrefour\n\n21.8’’ x 33.5’’\n\nWaterloo Center for the Arts\n\nThis flag is made with cloth, sequins, and beads. It is shown with mainly bright purple beads with three symbols going from top to bottom. The word “Carrefour” is seen in the lower left corner made with blue beads. “Le8banedre3 leis” is seen in the lower right corner with blue beads. A bright green satin cloth border is around the outside.\n\nVoodoo Ceremony Flag\n\n27’’ x 60’’\n\nWaterloo Center for the Arts\n\nThe Voodoo Ceremony Flag is made with cloth, sequins, and beads. This large flag depicts a voodoo ceremony with a large group of people. This includes a drum player, two nude females, baron, food, and libation. There is a cloth border in purple with small blue flowers and green leaves.\n\nAl Dalaflmbo-Negrel’a L’arch en Clfi\n\n18.75” x 31.75”\n\nWaterloo Center for the Arts\n\nThis flag or banner is made with cloth, sequins, and beads. It depicts a blonde nude woman with green snakes wrapped around her body. The woman is seems to be in front of a green drawn curtain with a black background behind it, and voodoo symbols on each side.\n\nSaint Patricke\n\n31.6’’ x 24.75”\n\nWaterloo Center for the Arts\n\nSaint Patricke is made of cloth, sequins, and beads. It is a St. Patrick Flag showing St Patrick in a green robe carrying a yellow staff and stepping on snakes. His hand is guiding the snakes towards the water.\n\nErzulie Freda\n\n26’’ x 22.5’’\n\nWaterloo Center for the Arts\n\nThis is a beaded flag that depicts Erzulie Freda based on an image on the Mater Dolorosa/Virgin of Sorrows chromolithograph. She is seen as robed in blue as she holds a staff and has various jewels around her. Many objects around her are in the shape of hearts. The entire flag is heavily beaded with a blue cloth border.\n\nOgou O Lishana-Gane Gre Jupi Tertannerre\n\n18.5” x 27”\n\nWaterloo Center for the Arts\n\nThe beaded flag is originated from Haiti and depicts a rooster in the center of a large oval covering the center of the flag. A cup and bottle are placed next to the rooster. The border on the outside is orange.\n\nOmnipresen Ciadvivn\n\n21’’ x 19’’\n\nWaterloo Center for the Arts\n\nThis is a sequined and beaded flag showing a dramatic image of an old testament deity. The flag shows a fair skinned, white-haired figure in the middle with his hands extended outwards. There is an eye at his torso with rays of color extending out from the eye in all directions. The scale on one side shows a scale with a devil and an angel. The cloth has a thin white border and a thick blue border around the outside.\n\nErzulie Freda\n\n52” x 53”\n\nWaterloo Center for the Arts\n\nErzulie Freda is a densely beaded flag with a blue satin border that depicts the individual, Erzulie Freda. The background is green. There is a large gold heart at the front and also to the lower right side of the figure.\n\nDambalah Wedo et Ayda Voir Preeace\n\n51’’ x 56.5’’\n\nWaterloo Center for the Arts\n\nThis is a sequined flag that originated from Haiti.

{"id": "330432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=330432", "title": "Note (typography)", "text": "Note (typography)\n\nA note is a string of text placed at the bottom of a page in a book or document or at the end of a chapter, volume or the whole text. The note can provide an author's comments on the main text or citations of a reference work in support of the text, or both.\n\nFootnotes are notes at the foot of the page while endnotes are collected under a separate heading at the end of a chapter, volume, or entire work. Unlike footnotes, endnotes have the advantage of not affecting the layout of the main text, but may cause inconvenience to readers who have to move back and forth between the main text and the endnotes.\n\nIn some editions of the Bible, notes are placed in a narrow column in the middle of each page between two columns of biblical text.\n\nIn English, a footnote is normally flagged by a superscripted number immediately following that portion of the text the note references, each such footnote being numbered sequentially. Occasionally a number between brackets or parentheses is used instead, thus: [1], which can also be superscripted, as in Wikipedia's own citation style rendered within this very page.\n\nTypographical devices such as the asterisk (*) or dagger (†) may also be used to point to footnotes; the traditional order of these symbols in English is *, †, ‡, §, ‖, ¶. Other symbols, including the #, Δ, ◊, ↓, and ☞, have also been used. In documents like timetables, many different symbols, letters and numbers may be used to refer the reader to particular notes.\n\nNotes are most often used as an alternative to long explanatory notes that can be distracting to readers. Most literary style guidelines (including the Modern Language Association and the American Psychological Association) recommend limited use of foot and endnotes. However, publishers often encourage note references in lieu of parenthetical references. Aside from use as a bibliographic element, notes are used for additional information or explanatory notes that might be too digressive for the main text. Footnotes are heavily utilized in academic institutions to support claims made in academic essays covering myriads of topics.\n\nIn particular, footnotes are the normal form of citation in historical journals. This is due, firstly, to the fact that the most important references are often to archive sources or interviews which do not readily fit standard formats, and secondly, to the fact that historians expect to see the exact nature of the evidence which is being used at each stage.\n\nThe MLA (Modern Language Association) requires the superscript numbers in the main text to be placed following the punctuation in the phrase or clause the note is in reference to. The exception to this rule occurs when a sentence contains a dash, in which case the superscript would precede it.\n\nAside from their technical use, authors use notes for a variety of reasons:\n\nThe US Government Printing Office Style Manual devotes over 660 words to the topic of footnotes. NASA has guidance for footnote usage in its historical documents.\nAssociate Justice Stephen Breyer of the Supreme Court of the United States is famous in the American legal community for his writing style, in which he never uses notes. He prefers to keep all citations within the text (which is permitted in American legal citation). Richard A. Posner has also written against the use of notes in judicial opinions. Bryan A. Garner, however, advocates using notes instead of inline citations.\n\nHTML, the predominant markup language for web pages, has no mechanism for marking up notes. Despite a number of different proposals over the years, and repeated pleas from the user base, the working group has been unable to reach a consensus on it. Because of this, MediaWiki, for example, has had to introduce its own codice_1 tag for citing references in notes, an idea which has since also been implemented for generic use by the \"Nelson\" HTML preprocessor.\n\nIt might be argued that the hyperlink partially eliminates the need for notes, being the web's way to refer to another document. However, it does not allow citing to offline sources and if the destination of the link changes, the link can become dead or irrelevant.\n\nThe sign is historically equal to the asterisks used by Aristarchus of Samothrace at the Mouseion at Alexandria. It was used for the critical editions of Homer's writings where it \"marked a verse incorrectly repeated in another passage\" and was used together with other signs such as the obelus.\n\nThe London printer Richard Jugge is generally credited as the inventor of the footnote, first used in the Bishops' Bible of 1568.\n\nEarly printings of the Douay Bible used two closely spaced colons (actually squared four dot punctuation mark U+2E2C) to indicate a marginal note.\n\nAt times, notes have been used for their comical effect, or as a literary device.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42497775", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42497775", "title": "Objects conservator", "text": "Objects conservator\n\nAn Objects conservator is a professional, working in a museum setting or private practice, that specializes in the conservation of three-dimensional works. They undergo specialized education, training, and experience that allows them to formulate and implement preventative strategies and invasive treatment protocols to preserve cultural property for the future. Objects conservators typically specialize in one type of material or class of cultural property, including metals, archaeological artifacts, ethnographic artifacts, glass, and ceramic art. Objects conservation presents many challenges due to their three-dimensional form and composite nature.\n\nThe diverse nature of artifacts that fall into the category of three dimensional objects presents a unique challenge to compiling a set of common procedures. However, preventative measures and treatment methodologies involve similar considerations that need to be addressed, regardless of the object's composition. In the words of Cesare Brandi, \"Restoration must aim to reestablish the potential unity of the work of art, as long as this is possible without producing an artistic or historical forgery and without erasing every trace of the passage of time left on the work of art.\" This means that an Objects Conservator needs to know when to draw the line, and communicate that limit to the object's custodian.\n\nWhile not as glamorous or hands-on as the other steps in this process, collections care, or preventative conservation, is arguably the most important. To truly preserve cultural heritage for the future, it is imperative to minimize deterioration by developing and implementing procedures to minimize the amount of physical and chemical stress an object encounters. This includes its environmental conditions (relative humidity, temperature, exposure to light), integrated pest management protocols, use of specialized storage containers, strategies for packing and shipping, exhibition conditions, and an emergency preparedness plan. The initial expense of such measures often causes institutions and private collectors to balk, but in comparison to the expense of the invasive treatments that will be needed if one does not take such preventative measures, the benefit outweighs the initial investment.\n\nPreventative conservation is also something that a private collector can implement for their own pieces. Controlling the amount of light an object is exposed to, the source of illumination, the ambient temperature of its environment, and protecting it from rapid changes in relative humidity goes a long way towards ensuring that an object will be around to pass down to future generations.\n\nWhile each object is unique, conservators begin with a similar process regardless of the artifact being assessed. A Conservator may need to stabilize an object at any stage in the process to prevent further loss, or, in extreme cases, begin by stabilizing an object before further examination can occur. Documentation takes place during every step of treatment, including: original condition, sample sites (if taken), different types of damage, areas of significant weakness before and after stabilization, and potential infestation sites. It is also important to document the objects condition before and after moving it, especially in the case of off-site transport. The ultimate goal of treatment is to preserve both the physical object and its interpretation, or cultural context.\n\nThe first step of any treatment protocol is a thorough examination of the object. This includes both its physical components and its cultural importance. Physical components include the materials used, its construction, and the appearance of the object's surface. The conservator often employs different techniques for this portion of the examination, including photographs taken in different light conditions such as visible, raking, and Ultraviolet to examine the surface, and x-rays to reveal the structure within. Cultural significance is more challenging to determine, including the object's meaning, function, intended use, and importance to society.\n\nThorough examination and research allows the Conservator to reconstruct an object's history and, together with the object's custodian (the owner, a curator, registrar, or collection manager) determine the object's ideal state and determine a realistic treatment goal.\nFollowing examination the Conservator will prepare a pre-treatment report that discusses the treatment goal for the object and the planned course of action. As defined by AIC, treatment is \"The deliberate alteration of the chemical and/or physical aspects of cultural property, aimed primarily at prolonging its existence.\" This can be something as minimal as reinforcing flaking paint, or something as complex as the migration of metals and salts through a wooden statue, leading to loss of strength, shrinkage, separation between the wooden support, metal fastenings, and decorative outer surface.\n\nObjects Conservators must be an expert collaborator, working with members of the public and museum professionals alike. Conservation is not a vacuum and practitioners collaborate with colleagues around the world, lending expertise and receiving guidance. They need to advocate for the object, explain their treatment protocol, the importance of preventative measures, and stand firm when asked to reconsider a \"no\". They must also be open to alternate interpretations, have an understanding of different materials and construction techniques,keen observation skills, and deft hands.\n\nMost museums and prestigious private firms require graduate degrees in Conservation. Without graduate level education, knowledge of chemistry, hands-on experience, and a thorough foundation in documentation, evaluation, and treatment an institution or firm is taking a serious risk. Anyone can call themselves a conservator, but it is the specialized training gained through graduate programs or similar experiences that count.\n\nGaining admission to a conservation graduate program includes an undergraduate degree, a concentration in chemistry (specifically organic chemistry), and a significant number of hours working under a trained Conservator. This ensures that the candidate has a through foundation upon which to build and is already familiar with many aspects of the process.\n\nThese programs include University of Delaware, NYU, Buffalo State University, Queens University, University College London, Cardiff University\n\nDue to the diverse nature of this type of cultural heritage, most objects conservators specialize on one type of artifact or material. The following are a selection of possible specialties:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Siva Kumar. It is widely considered as a landmark book in the Indian art scene that brings together a large corpus of Abanindranath's work for the first time. It fulfils a glaring lacuna in the picture of this master of modern Indian art.\n\nIn the books R. Siva Kumar states, 'The social space that Abanindranath narrativized as an artist-flaneur is thus the subject of the Orientalist artist/writer read from the obverse. He reclaims the colonial subjects' right to narrate their stories that was arrogated to themselves by the colonial rulers and perpetuated by presenting their readings as 'objective'. Abanindranath reasserts this right by recasting the Nights (Arabian Nights), a text central to the Orientalist representation of the East, by urging us to read his act of imagination contrapuntally with the text authenticated by the Orientalist.'\n\nAbanindranath Tagore (1871–1951) is a singular figure in Modern Indian Art. Having arrived on the Indian art scene with the first wave of nationalism, he was seen as father figure of nationalist art and modernism. Along with E. B. Havell, Coomaraswamy, Sister Nivedita and other nationalists he brought an attitudinal change in the Indian response to traditional art. But his true contribution went beyond these. Trained under European artists initially, realism remained the underpinning of his work. But as a modernist at heart who was guided more by his sensibility than his training, he transformed the post Renaissance academic realism into which he was trained with his series of contacts with oriental art into something more supple and responsive to the imaginative flights of his mind. A post-Romantic in his sensibilities, he let his individualism triumph over his nationalism. Although he aligned with the nationalists in the early years of his career he transcended it very soon to develop something more akin to a Baudelairian aesthetics of modernism with a subjective response to the world rather than an unmediated representation of things. His most impressive work, the Arabian Nights series painted in 1930, can be described as a look at his immediate world through the eyes of a Baudelarian Flaneur, with the stories of the Arabian Nights serving as a pre-text. Equally original as a writer, Abanindranath is a phenomenon whose import has not been fully grasped. Much of this has been due to the unfamiliarity with his work in the absence of easily accessible public collections and publications. The present book brings together a large body of his work for the first time in an attempt to fulfill a glaring lacuna in our picture of this early master of modern Indian art.\n\nThe book has also influenced other books and researches on Abanindranath Tagore. Ananya Vajpeyi in her \"Righteous Republic: The Political Foundations of Modern India\" highlights the contribution of R. Siva Kumar's \"Paintings of Abanindranath Tagore\" in foregrounding Abanindranath Tagore's art anew.\n\n"}
{"id": "210093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=210093", "title": "Portrait", "text": "Portrait\n\nA portrait is a painting, photograph, sculpture, or other artistic representation of a person, in which the face and its expression is predominant. The intent is to display the likeness, personality, and even the mood of the person. For this reason, in photography a portrait is generally not a snapshot, but a composed image of a person in a still position. A portrait often shows a person looking directly at the painter or photographer, in order to most successfully engage the subject with the viewer.\n\nMost early representations that are clearly intended to show an individual are of rulers, and tend to follow idealizing artistic conventions, rather than the individual features of the subject's body, though when there is no other evidence as to the ruler's appearance the degree of idealization can be hard to assess. Nonetheless, many subjects, such as Akhenaten and some other Egyptian pharaohs, can be recognised by their distinctive features. The 28 surviving rather small statues of Gudea, ruler of Lagash in Sumeria between c. 2144 - 2124 BC, show a consistent appearance with some individuality.\n\nSome of the earliest surviving painted portraits of people who were not rulers are the Greco-Roman funeral portraits that survived in the dry climate of Egypt's Fayum district. These are almost the only paintings from the classical world that have survived, apart from frescos, though many sculptures and portraits on coins have fared better. Although the appearance of the figures differs considerably, they are considerably idealized, and all show relatively young people, making it uncertain whether they were painted from life.\n\nThe art of the portrait flourished in Ancient Greek and especially Roman sculpture, where sitters demanded individualized and realistic portraits, even unflattering ones. During the 4th century, the portrait began to retreat in favor of an idealized symbol of what that person looked like. (Compare the portraits of Roman Emperors Constantine I and Theodosius I at their entries.) In the Europe of the Early Middle Ages representations of individuals are mostly generalized. True portraits of the outward appearance of individuals re-emerged in the late Middle Ages, in tomb monuments, donor portraits, miniatures in illuminated manuscripts and then panel paintings.\n\nMoche culture of Peru was one of the few ancient civilizations which produced portraits. These works accurately represent anatomical features in great detail. The individuals portrayed would have been recognizable without the need for other symbols or a written reference to their names. The individuals portrayed were members of the ruling elite, priests, warriors and even distinguished artisans. They were represented during several stages of their lives. The faces of gods were also depicted. To date, no portraits of women have been found. There is particular emphasis on the representation of the details of headdresses, hairstyles, body adornment and face painting.\n\nOne of the best-known portraits in the Western world is Leonardo da Vinci's painting titled \"Mona Lisa\", which is a painting of Lisa del Giocondo. What has been claimed as the world's oldest known portrait was found in 2006 in the Vilhonneur grotto near Angoulême and is thought to be 27,000 years old.\n\nWhen the artist creates a portrait of him- or herself, it is called a \"self-portrait\". Identifiable examples become numerous in the late Middle Ages. But if the definition is extended, the first was by the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten's sculptor Bak, who carved a representation of himself and his wife Taheri c. 1365 BC. However, it seems likely that self-portraits go back to the cave paintings, the earliest representational art, and literature records several classical examples that are now lost.\n\nThe official portrait is a photographic production of record and dissemination of important personalities, notably kings, presidents and governors. It is usually decorated with official colors and symbols such as flag, presidential stripes and coat of arms of countries, states or municipalities. There is also connotation as an image of events, products and meetings.\n\nPortrait photography is a popular commercial industry all over the world. Many people enjoy having professionally made \"family portraits\" to hang in their homes, or special portraits to commemorate certain events, such as graduations or weddings.\n\nSince the dawn of photography, people have made portraits. The popularity of the daguerreotype in the middle of the 19th century was due in large part to the demand for inexpensive portraiture. Studios sprang up in cities around the world, some cranking out more than 500 plates a day. The style of these early works reflected the technical challenges associated with 30-second exposure times and the painterly aesthetic of the time. Subjects were generally seated against plain backgrounds and lit with the soft light of an overhead window and whatever else could be reflected with mirrors.\n\nAs photographic techniques developed, an intrepid group of photographers took their talents out of the studio and onto battlefields, across oceans and into remote wilderness. William Shew's \"Daguerreotype Saloon\", Roger Fenton's \"Photographic Van\" and Mathew Brady's \"What-is-it?\" wagon set the standards for making portraits and other photographs in the field.\n\nIn politics, portraits of the leader are often used as a symbol of the state. In most countries it is common protocol for a portrait of the head of state to appear in important government buildings. Excessive use of a leader's portrait, such as that done of Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, or Mao Zedong, can be indicative of a personality cult.\n\nIn literature the term \"portrait\" refers to a written description or analysis of a person or thing. A written portrait often gives deep insight, and offers an analysis that goes far beyond the superficial. For example, American author Patricia Cornwell wrote a best-selling book entitled \"Portrait of a Killer\" about the personality, background, and possible motivations of Jack the Ripper, as well as the media coverage of his murders, and the subsequent police investigation of his crimes.\n\n\n"}

His books have sold more than 350 million copies, many of which have been adapted into feature films, miniseries, television series, and comic books. King has published 58 novels, including seven under the pen name Richard Bachman, and six non-fiction books. He has written around 200 short stories, most of which have been published in book collections.\n\nKing has received Bram Stoker Awards, World Fantasy Awards, and British Fantasy Society Awards. In 2003, the National Book Foundation awarded him the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. He has also received awards for his contribution to literature for his entire \"oeuvre\", such as the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement (2004), and the Grand Master Award from the Mystery Writers of America (2007). In 2015, King was awarded with a National Medal of Arts from the United States National Endowment for the Arts for his contributions to literature. He has been described as the \"King of Horror\".\n\nKing was born September 21, 1947, in Portland, Maine. His father, Donald Edwin King, was a merchant seaman. Donald was born under the surname Pollock, but as an adult, used the surname King. King's mother was Nellie Ruth (née Pillsbury).\n\nWhen Stephen King was two years old, his father left the family under the pretense of \"going to buy a pack of cigarettes,\" leaving his mother to raise Stephen and his older brother, David, by herself, sometimes under great financial strain. The family moved to De Pere, Wisconsin, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Stratford, Connecticut. When King was 11, his family returned to Durham, Maine, where his mother cared for her parents until their deaths. She then became a caregiver in a local residential facility for the mentally challenged. King was raised Methodist but lost his belief in organised religion while in high school. While no longer religious, King chooses to believe in the existence of a God.\n\nAs a child, King apparently witnessed one of his friends being struck and killed by a train, though he has no memory of the event. His family told him that after leaving home to play with the boy, King returned, speechless and seemingly in shock. Only later did the family learn of the friend's death. Some commentators have suggested that this event may have psychologically inspired some of King's darker works, but King makes no mention of it in his memoir \"\" (2000).\n\nKing related in detail his primary inspiration for writing horror fiction in his non-fiction \"Danse Macabre\" (1981), in a chapter titled \"An Annoying Autobiographical Pause.\" King compares his uncle's dowsing for water using the bough of an apple branch with the sudden realization of what he wanted to do for a living. That inspiration occurred while browsing through an attic with his elder brother, when King uncovered a paperback version of an H. P. Lovecraft collection of short stories he remembers as \"The Lurker in the Shadows\", that had belonged to his father. King told Barnes & Noble Studios during a 2009 interview, \"I knew that I'd found home when I read that book.\"\n\nKing attended Durham Elementary School and graduated from Lisbon Falls High School, in Lisbon Falls, Maine. He displayed an early interest in horror as an avid reader of EC's horror comics, including \"Tales from the Crypt\" (he later paid tribute to the comics in his screenplay for \"Creepshow\"). He began writing for fun while still in school, contributing articles to \"Dave's Rag\", the newspaper his brother published with a mimeograph machine, and later began selling to his friends stories based on movies he had seen (though when discovered by his teachers, he was forced to return the profits). The first of his stories to be independently published was \"I Was a Teenage Grave Robber\"; it was serialized over four issues (three published and one unpublished) of a fanzine, \"Comics Review\", in 1965. That story was published the following year in a revised form as \"In a Half-World of Terror\" in another fanzine, \"Stories of Suspense\", edited by Marv Wolfman. As a teen, King also won a Scholastic Art and Writing Award.\n\nFrom 1966, King studied at the University of Maine, graduating in 1970 with a Bachelor of Arts in English. That year, his daughter Naomi Rachel was born. He wrote a column, \"Steve King's Garbage Truck\", for the student newspaper, \"The Maine Campus\" and participated in a writing workshop organized by Burton Hatlen. King held a variety of jobs to pay for his studies, including janitor, gas pump attendant, and worker at an industrial laundry.\n\nKing sold his first professional short story, \"The Glass Floor,\" to \"Startling Mystery Stories\" in 1967. The Fogler Library at the University of Maine now holds many of King's papers.\n\nAfter leaving the university, King earned a certificate to teach high school but, unable to find a teaching post immediately, initially supplemented his laboring wage by selling short stories to men's magazines such as \"Cavalier\". Many of these early stories have been republished in the collection \"Night Shift\". The short story \"The Raft\" was published in \"Adam\", a men's magazine. After being arrested for driving over a traffic cone, he was fined $250 and had no money to pay the petty larceny fine. Luckily payment arrived for the short story \"The Raft\", then entitled \"The Float\", and \"all I did was cash the check and pay the fine.\" In 1971, King married Tabitha Spruce, a fellow student at the University of Maine whom he had met at the University's Fogler Library after one of Professor Hatlen's workshops. That fall, King was hired as a teacher at Hampden Academy in Hampden, Maine. He continued to contribute short stories to magazines and worked on ideas for novels. During that time, King developed a drinking problem which would plague him for more than a decade.\n\nIn 1973, King's first novel \"Carrie\" was accepted by publishing house Doubleday. King had thrown an early draft of the novel into the trash after becoming discouraged with his progress writing about a teenage girl with psychic powers. His wife retrieved the manuscript and encouraged him to finish it. His advance for \"Carrie\" was $2,500; King's paperback rights later earned $400,000.\n\nKing and his family moved to southern Maine because of his mother's failing health. At this time, he began writing a book titled \"Second Coming\", later titled \"Jerusalem's Lot\", before finally changing the title to \"Salem's Lot\" (published 1975). In a 1987 issue of \"The Highway Patrolman\" magazine, he stated, \"The story seems sort of down home to me. I have a special cold spot in my heart for it!\" Soon after \"Carrie\"s release in 1974, King's mother died of uterine cancer. His Aunt Emrine had read the novel to her before she died. King has written of his severe drinking problem at this time, stating that he was drunk delivering the eulogy at his mother's funeral.\n\nAfter his mother's death, King and his family moved to Boulder, Colorado, where King wrote \"The Shining\" (published 1977). The family returned to western Maine in 1975, where King completed his fourth novel, \"The Stand\" (published 1978). In 1977, the family, with the addition of Owen Phillip (his third and last child), traveled briefly to England, returning to Maine that fall, where King began teaching creative writing at the University of Maine. He has kept his primary residence in Maine ever since.\n\nIn 1985, King wrote his first work for the comic book medium, writing a few pages of the benefit X-Men comic book \"Heroes for Hope Starring the X-Men\". The book, whose profits were donated to assist with famine relief in Africa, was written by a number of different authors in the comic book field, such as Chris Claremont, Stan Lee, and Alan Moore, as well as authors not primarily associated with that industry, such as Harlan Ellison. The following year, King published \"It\" (1986), which was the best-selling hard-cover novel in the United States that year, and wrote the introduction to \"Batman\" No. 400, an anniversary issue in which he expressed his preference for that character over Superman.\n\nIn the late 1970s, King began what became a series of interconnected stories about a lone gunslinger, Roland, who pursues the \"Man in Black\" in an alternate-reality universe that is a cross between J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth and the American Wild West as depicted by Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone in their spaghetti Westerns. The first of these stories, \"\", was initially published in five installments by \"The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction\" under the editorship of Edward L. Ferman, from 1977 to 1981. \"The Gunslinger\" was continued as an eight-book epic series called \"The Dark Tower\", whose books King wrote and published infrequently over four decades.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, King published a handful of short novels—\"Rage\" (1977), \"The Long Walk\" (1979), \"Roadwork\" (1981), \"The Running Man\" (1982) and \"Thinner\" (1984)—under the pseudonym Richard Bachman. The idea behind this was to test whether he could replicate his success again and to allay his fears that his popularity was an accident. An alternate explanation was that publishing standards at the time allowed only a single book a year. He picked up the name from the hard rock band Bachman-Turner Overdrive, of which he is a fan.\n\nRichard Bachman was exposed as King's pseudonym by a persistent Washington, D.C. bookstore clerk, Steve Brown, who noticed similarities between the works and later located publisher's records at the Library of Congress that named King as the author of one of Bachman's novels. This led to a press release heralding Bachman's \"death\"—supposedly from \"cancer of the pseudonym\". King dedicated his 1989 book \"The Dark Half\", about a pseudonym turning on a writer, to \"the deceased Richard Bachman\", and in 1996, when the Stephen King novel \"Desperation\" was released, the companion novel \"The Regulators\" carried the \"Bachman\" byline.\n\nIn 2006, during a press conference in London, King declared that he had discovered another Bachman novel, titled \"Blaze\". It was published on June 12, 2007. In fact, the original manuscript had been held at King's alma mater, the University of Maine in Orono, for many years and had been covered by numerous King experts. King rewrote the original 1973 manuscript for its publication.\n\nKing has used other pseudonyms. The short story \"The Fifth Quarter\" was published under the pseudonym John Swithen (the name of a character in the novel \"Carrie\"), that was published in \"Cavalier\" in April 1972. The story was reprinted in King's collection \"Nightmares & Dreamscapes\" in 1993 under his own name. In the introduction to the Bachman novel \"Blaze\", King claims, with tongue-in-cheek, that \"Bachman\" was the person using the Swithen pseudonym.\n\nThe \"children's book\" \"Charlie the Choo-Choo: From the World of The Dark Tower\" was published under the pseudonym Beryl Evans, who was portrayed by actress Allison Davies during a book signing at San Diego Comic-Con, and illustrated by Ned Dameron. It is adapted from a fictional book central to the plot of King's previous novel \"\" and published in 2016.\n\nIn 2000, King published online a serialized horror novel, \"The Plant\". At first the public presumed that King had abandoned the project because sales were unsuccessful, but King later stated that he had simply run out of stories. The unfinished epistolary novel is still available from King's official site, now free. Also in 2000, he wrote a digital novella, \"Riding the Bullet\", and has said he sees e-books becoming 50% of the market \"probably by 2013 and maybe by 2012\". But he also warns: \"Here's the thing—people tire of the new toys quickly.\"\n\nIn August 2003, King began writing a column on pop culture appearing in \"Entertainment Weekly\", usually every third week. The column, called \"The Pop of King\" (a play on the nickname \"The King of Pop\" commonly attributed to Michael Jackson).\n\nIn 2006, King published an apocalyptic novel, \"Cell\". The book features a sudden force in which every cell phone user turns into a mindless killer. King noted in the book's introduction that he does not use cell phones.\n\nIn 2008, King published both a novel, \"Duma Key\", and a collection, \"Just After Sunset\". The latter featured 13 short stories, including a novella, \"N.\", which was later released as a serialized animated series that could be seen for free, or, for a small fee, could be downloaded in a higher quality; it then was adopted into a limited comic book series.\n\nIn 2009, King published \"Ur\", a novella written exclusively for the launch of the second-generation Amazon Kindle and available only on Amazon.com, and \"Throttle\", a novella co-written with his son Joe Hill and released later as an audiobook titled \"Road Rage\", which included Richard Matheson's short story \"Duel\". King's novel \"Under the Dome\" was published on November 10 of that year; it is a reworking of an unfinished novel he tried writing twice in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and at 1,074 pages, it is the largest novel he has written since \"It\" (1986). \"Under the Dome\" debuted at No. 1 in \"The New York Times\" Bestseller List.\n\nOn February 16, 2010, King announced on his Web site that his next book would be a collection of four previously unpublished novellas called \"Full Dark, No Stars\". In April of that year, King published \"Blockade Billy\", an original novella issued first by independent small press Cemetery Dance Publications and later released in mass-market paperback by Simon & Schuster. The following month, DC Comics premiered \"American Vampire\", a monthly comic book series written by King with short-story writer Scott Snyder, and illustrated by Rafael Albuquerque, which represents King's first original comics work. King wrote the background history of the very first American vampire, Skinner Sweet, in the first five-issues story arc. Scott Snyder wrote the story of Pearl.\n\nKing's next novel, \"11/22/63\", was published November 8, 2011, and was nominated for the 2012 World Fantasy Award Best Novel. The eighth \"Dark Tower\" volume, \"\", was published in 2012. King's next book was \"Joyland\", a novel about \"an amusement-park serial killer\", according to an article in \"The Sunday Times\", published on April 8, 2012. It was followed by the sequel to \"The Shining\" (1977), titled \"Doctor Sleep\", published in September 2013.\n\nDuring his Chancellor's Speaker Series talk at University of Massachusetts Lowell on December 7, 2012, King indicated that he was writing a crime novel about a retired policeman being taunted by a murderer. With a working title \"Mr. Mercedes\" and inspired by a true event about a woman driving her car into a McDonald's restaurant, it was originally meant to be a short story just a few pages long. In an interview with \"Parade\", published May 26, 2013, King confirmed that the novel was \"more or less\" completed he published it in June 2013. Later, on June 20, 2013, while doing a video chat with fans as part of promoting the upcoming \"Under the Dome\" TV series, King mentioned he was halfway through writing his next novel, \"Revival\", which was released November 11, 2014.\n\nKing announced in June 2014 that \"Mr. Mercedes\" is part of a trilogy; the second book, \"Finders Keepers\", was released on June 2, 2015. On April 22, 2015, it was revealed that King was working on the third book of the trilogy which name was later revealed to be \"End of Watch\". The book was released on June 7, 2016, and hit the top of the \"New York Times\" bestseller list.\n\nOn November 3, 2015, King released his tenth collection of short stories, \"The Bazaar of Bad Dreams\". The book was released to critical acclaim and commercial success.\n\nDuring a tour to promote \"End of Watch\", King revealed that he had collaborated on a novel, set in a women's prison in West Virginia, with his son, Owen King to be titled \"Sleeping Beauties\". When the novel was released in October 2017, it reached the top of the \"New York Times\" Best Seller List.\n\nKing has written two novels with horror novelist Peter Straub: \"The Talisman\" (1984) and a sequel, \"Black House\" (2001). King has indicated that he and Straub will likely write the third and concluding book in this series, the tale of Jack Sawyer, but has set no deadline for its completion.\n\nKing produced an artist's book with designer Barbara Kruger, \"My Pretty Pony\" (1989), published in a limited edition of 250 by the Library Fellows of the Whitney Museum of American Art. Alfred A. Knopf released it in a general trade edition and the short story was later included in King's collection \"Nightmares & Dreamscapes\" published in 1993.\n\n\"\" (2001) was a paperback tie-in for the King-penned miniseries \"Rose Red\" (2002). Published under anonymous authorship, the book was written by Ridley Pearson. The novel is written in the form of a diary by Ellen Rimbauer, and annotated by the fictional professor of paranormal activity, Joyce Reardon. The novel also presents a fictional afterword by Ellen Rimbauer's grandson, Steven. Intended to be a promotional item rather than a stand-alone work, its popularity spawned a 2003 prequel television miniseries to \"Rose Red\", titled \"The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer\". This spin-off is a rare occasion of another author's being granted permission to write commercial work using characters and story elements invented by King. The novel tie-in idea was repeated on Stephen King's next project, the miniseries \"Kingdom Hospital\". Richard Dooling, King's collaborator on \"Kingdom Hospital\" and writer of several episodes in the miniseries, published a fictional diary, \"The Journals of Eleanor Druse\", in 2004. Eleanor Druse is a key character in \"Kingdom Hospital\", much as Dr. Joyce Readon and Ellen Rimbauer are key characters in \"Rose Red.\"\n\nKing also wrote the nonfiction book, \"Faithful\" (2004), with novelist and fellow Red Sox fanatic Stewart O'Nan.\n\n\"Throttle\" (2009), a novella written in collaboration with his son Joe Hill, appears in the anthology \"He Is Legend: Celebrating Richard Matheson\". Their second novella collaboration, \"In the Tall Grass\" (2012), was published in two parts in \"Esquire\". It was later released in e-book and audiobook formats, the latter read by Stephen Lang.\n\nStephen King and Richard Chizmar co-wrote \"Gwendy's Button Box\" which was released in May 2017 from Cemetery Dance Publications (in trade hardcover format) and in audiobook from Simon & Schuster Audio (the audiobook has a bonus short story \"The Music Room\" which was originally published in \"Playboy\").\n\nKing and his son Owen King wrote the novel \"Sleeping Beauties\", released in 2017, that is set in a women's prison.\n\nKing is a fan of the Ramones, to the extent that he wrote the liner notes for the 2003 Ramones tribute album \"\". He states that he agreed to write them because he \"loved The Ramones from the first time (he) heard them\". Furthermore, King has referred to the band several times in his writing, both in his fiction and non-fiction. Non-fiction references include a mention in King's book \"Danse Macabre\" where he calls the Ramones \"an amusing punk-rock band that surfaced some four years ago\". He also wrote about them in \"On Writing\", making reference to \"dancing to the Ramones—gabba gabba hey\" as one of the reasons he has maintained a good marriage. King included further Ramones references in his fictional work. He quotes the lyrics to the Ramones' debut single \"Blitzkrieg Bop\" in his novel \"Pet Sematary\" on numerous occasions, as in the sentence \"What is it the Ramones say? Hey-ho, let's go\"! In \"The Dark Tower\" novel \"\" the Ramones get a further mention by the character Eddie Dean who states that \"Roland stage-dives like Joey Ramone\". Critics have also noted the Ramones references. \"Entertainment Weekly\", for example, in their review of \"Black House\" by King and Peter Straub, note that King's \"trademark references\" are in evidence, quoting Dee Dee Ramone. In turn, the Ramones have referenced King on their song \"It's Not My Place (In the 9 to 5 World)\", from their \"Pleasant Dreams\" album of 1981 in the line: \"Ramones are hangin' out in Kokomo / Roger Corman's on a talk show / With Allan Arkush and Stephen King\". Further, Dee Dee Ramone wrote the song \"Pet Sematary\" in King's basement after King handed him a copy of the novel. The song was eventually featured as the title song for the \"Pet Sematary\" (1989) film and also appeared on the Ramones album \"Brain Drain\" (1989).\n\nKing is also a fan of hard rock such as AC/DC; he arranged for their album \"Who Made Who\" to feature as the score for the film he directed in 1986, \"Maximum Overdrive\". King has also stated that he likes heavy metal and has named bands like Anthrax, Judas Priest and Metallica as amongst his favourites to write to. In 1988, the band Blue Öyster Cult recorded an updated version of its 1974 song \"Astronomy\". The single released for radio play featured a narrative intro spoken by King. The Blue Öyster Cult song \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\" was also used in the King TV series \"The Stand\".\n\nKing collaborated with Michael Jackson to create \"Ghosts\" (1996), a 40-minute musical video. King states he was motivated to collaborate as he is \"always interested in trying something new, and for (him), writing a minimusical would be new\". In 2012 King collaborated with musician Shooter Jennings and his band Hierophant, providing the narration for their album, \"Black Ribbons\". King played guitar for the rock band Rock Bottom Remainders, several of whose members are authors. Other members include Dave Barry, Ridley Pearson, Scott Turow, Amy Tan, James McBride, Mitch Albom, Roy Blount, Jr., Matt Groening, Kathi Kamen Goldmark, Sam Barry, and Greg Iles. King and the other band members collaborated to release an e-book called \"Hard Listening: The Greatest Rock Band Ever (of Authors) Tells All\" (June 2013). King wrote a musical play \"Ghost Brothers of Darkland County\" (2012) with musician John Mellencamp.\n\nKing's formula for learning to write well is: \"Read and write four to six hours a day. If you cannot find the time for that, you can't expect to become a good writer.\" He sets out each day with a quota of 2000 words and will not stop writing until it is met. He also has a simple definition for talent in writing: \"If you wrote something for which someone sent you a check, if you cashed the check and it didn't bounce, and if you then paid the light bill with the money, I consider you talented.\"\n\nShortly after his accident, King wrote the first draft of the book \"Dreamcatcher\" with a notebook and a Waterman fountain pen, which he called \"the world's finest word processor\".\n\nWhen asked why he writes, King responds: \"The answer to that is fairly simple—there was nothing else I was made to do. I was made to write stories and I love to write stories. That's why I do it. I really can't imagine doing anything else and I can't imagine not doing what I do.\" He is also often asked why he writes such terrifying stories and he answers with another question: \"Why do you assume I have a choice?\" King usually begins the story creation process by imagining a \"what if\" scenario, such as what would happen if a writer is kidnapped by a sadistic nurse in Colorado.\n\nKing often uses authors as characters, or includes mention of fictional books in his stories, novellas and novels, such as Paul Sheldon who is the main character in \"Misery\", adult Bill Denbrough in \"It\", Ben Mears in \"Salem's Lot\", and Jack Torrance in \"The Shining\". He has extended this to breaking the fourth wall by including \"himself\" as a character in the \"Dark Tower\" series from \"Wolves of the Calla\" onwards. See also List of fictional books in the works of Stephen King for a complete list. In September 2009 it was announced he would serve as a writer for \"Fangoria\".\n\nKing has called Richard Matheson \"the author who influenced me most as a writer.\" In a current edition of Matheson's \"The Shrinking Man\", King is quoted: \"A horror story if there ever was one...a great adventure story—it is certainly one of that select handful that I have given to people, envying them the experience of the first reading.\" Ray Bradbury is another influence, with King himself stating \"without Ray Bradbury, there is no Stephen King\".\n\nKing refers to H. P. Lovecraft several times in \"Danse Macabre\". \"Gramma\", a short story made into a film in the 1980s anthology horror show \"The New Twilight Zone\", mentions Lovecraft's notorious fictional creation \"Necronomicon\", also borrowing the names of a number of the fictional monsters mentioned therein. \"I Know What You Need\" from the 1976 collection \"Night Shift\", and \"'Salem's Lot\" also mention the tome. Despite this, in \"On Writing\", King is critical of Lovecraft's dialogue-writing skills, using passages from \"The Colour Out of Space\" as particularly poor examples. There are also several examples of King's referring to Lovecraftian characters and settings in his work, such as Nyarlathotep and Yog-Sothoth.\n\nKing acknowledges the influence of Bram Stoker, particularly on his novel \"Salem's Lot\", which he envisioned as a retelling of \"Dracula\". Its related short story \"Jerusalem's Lot\" is reminiscent of Stoker's \"The Lair of the White Worm\". He also gives Joseph Payne Brennan credit for being one of his inspirations; \"Joseph Payne Brennan is one of the most effective writers in the horror genre, and he is certainly one of the writers I have patterned my own career upon; one of the writers whom I studied and with whom I kept school.\"\n\nKing's \"The Shining\" is immersed in gothic influences, including \"The Masque of the Red Death\" by Edgar Allan Poe (which was directly influenced by the first gothic novel, Horace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto\"). The Overlook Hotel acts as a replacement for the traditional gothic castle, and Jack Torrance is a tragic villain seeking redemption.\n\nKing has also referred to author Shirley Jackson. \"Salem's Lot\" opens with a quotation from Jackson's \"The Haunting of Hill House\", and a character in \"\" references the Jackson book \"We Have Always Lived in the Castle\". King's book \"11/22/63\" mentions the Jackson story \"The Summer People\". King is a fan of John D. MacDonald, and dedicated the novella \"Sun Dog\" to MacDonald, saying \"I miss you, old friend.\" For his part, MacDonald wrote an admiring preface to \"Night Shift\", and even had his famous character, Travis McGee, reading \"Cujo\" in one of the last McGee novels and \"Pet Sematary\" in the last McGee novel, \"The Lonely Silver Rain.\"\n\nIn 1987, King's Philtrum Press published Don Robertson's novel \"The Ideal, Genuine Man\". In his forenote to the novel, King wrote, \"Don Robertson was and is one of the three writers who influenced me as a young man who was trying to 'become' a novelist (the other two being Richard Matheson and John D. MacDonald).\" Robert A. Heinlein's book \"The Door into Summer\" is repeatedly mentioned in King's \"Wolves of the Calla\" (2003), as are several other works. \"Wolves of the Calla\" is the King work in which \"The Dark Tower\" begins to follow a meta-fictional path.\n\nIn an interview with King, published in the \"USA Weekend\" in March 2009, the author stated, \"People look on writers that they like as an irreplaceable resource. I do. Elmore Leonard, every day I wake up and—not to be morbid or anything, although morbid is my life to a degree—don't see his obituary in the paper, I think to myself, \"Great! He's probably working somewhere. He's gonna produce another book, and I'll have another book to read. Because when he's gone, there's nobody else.\"\n\nKing partly dedicated his book \"Cell\" to film director George Romero, and wrote an essay for the Elite DVD version of \"Night of the Living Dead\".\nHis favorite books are (in order): \"The Golden Argosy\"; \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\"; \"The Satanic Verses\"; \"McTeague\"; \"Lord of the Flies\"; \"Bleak House\"; \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\"; \"The Raj Quartet\"; \"Light in August\"; and \"Blood Meridian\".\n\nAlthough critical reaction to King's work has been mostly positive, he has occasionally come under fire from academic writers.\n\nScience fiction editors John Clute and Peter Nichols offer a largely favorable appraisal of King, noting his \"pungent prose, sharp ear for dialogue, disarmingly laid-back, frank style, along with his passionately fierce denunciation of human stupidity and cruelty (especially to children) [all of which rank] him among the more distinguished 'popular' writers.\"\n\nIn his book \"The Philosophy of Horror\" (1990), Noël Carroll discusses King's work as an exemplar of modern horror fiction. Analyzing both the narrative structure of King's fiction and King's non-fiction ruminations on the art and craft of writing, Carroll writes that for King, \"the horror story is always a contest between the normal and the abnormal such that the normal is reinstated and, therefore, affirmed.\"\n\nIn his analysis of post–World War II horror fiction, \"The Modern Weird Tale\" (2001), critic S. T. Joshi devotes a chapter to King's work. Joshi argues that King's best-known works (his supernatural novels), are his worst, describing them as mostly bloated, illogical, maudlin and prone to \"deus ex machina\" endings. Despite these criticisms, Joshi argues that since \"Gerald's Game\" (1993), King has been tempering the worst of his writing faults, producing books that are leaner, more believable and generally better written. Joshi suggests that King's strengths as a writer include the accessible \"everyman\" quality of his prose, and his unfailingly insightful observations about the pains and joys of adolescence. Joshi cites two early non-supernatural novels—\"Rage\" (1977) and \"The Running Man\" (1982)—as King's best, suggesting both are riveting and well-constructed suspense thrillers, with believable characters.\n\nIn 1996, King won an O. Henry Award for his short story \"The Man in the Black Suit\".\n\nIn his short story collection \"A Century of Great Suspense Stories\", editor Jeffery Deaver noted that King \"singlehandedly made popular fiction grow up. While there were many good best-selling writers before him, King, more than anybody since John D. MacDonald, brought reality to genre novels. He has often remarked that \"'Salem's Lot\" was \"\"Peyton Place\" meets \"Dracula\". And so it was. The rich characterization, the careful and caring social eye, the interplay of story line and character development announced that writers could take worn themes such as vampirism and make them fresh again. Before King, many popular writers found their efforts to make their books serious blue-penciled by their editors. 'Stuff like that gets in the way of the story,' they were told. Well, it's stuff like that that has made King so popular, and helped free the popular name from the shackles of simple genre writing. He is a master of masters.\"\n\nIn 2003, King was honored by the National Book Awards with a lifetime achievement award, the Medal of Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. Some in the literary community expressed disapproval of the award: Richard E. Snyder, the former CEO of Simon & Schuster, described King's work as \"non-literature\" and critic Harold Bloom denounced the choice:\n\nThe decision to give the National Book Foundation's annual award for \"distinguished contribution\" to Stephen King is extraordinary, another low in the shocking process of dumbing down our cultural life. I've described King in the past as a writer of penny dreadfuls, but perhaps even that is too kind. He shares nothing with Edgar Allan Poe. What he is is an immensely inadequate writer on a sentence-by-sentence, paragraph-by-paragraph, book-by-book basis.\n\nHowever, others came to King's defense, such as writer Orson Scott Card, who responded:\n\nLet me assure you that King's work most definitely is literature, because it was written to be published and is read with admiration. What Snyder really means is that it is not the literature preferred by the academic-literary elite.\n\nKing himself later stated:\n\n[Harold] Bloom never pissed me off because there are critics out there, and he's one of them, who take their ignorance about popular culture as a badge of intellectual prowess. He might be able to say that Mark Twain is a great writer, but it's impossible for him to say that there's a direct line of descent from, say, Nathaniel Hawthorne to Jim Thompson because he doesn't read guys like Thompson. He just thinks, \"I never read him, but I know he's terrible.\"\n\nIn Roger Ebert's review of the 2004 movie \"Secret Window\", he stated, \"A lot of people were outraged that [King] was honored at the National Book Awards, as if a popular writer could not be taken seriously. But after finding that his book \"On Writing\" had more useful and observant things to say about the craft than any book since Strunk and White's \"The Elements of Style\", I have gotten over my own snobbery.\"\n\nIn 2008, King's book \"On Writing\" was ranked 21st on \"Entertainment Weekly\" list of \"The New Classics: The 100 Best Reads from 1983 to 2008\".\n\nKing and his wife Tabitha own Zone Radio Corp, a radio station group consisting of WZON/620 AM, WKIT-FM/100.3 & WZLO/103.1.\n\nKing has stated that his favorite book-to-film adaptations are \"Stand by Me\", \"The Shawshank Redemption\", and \"The Mist\".\n\nKing's first film appearance was in George Romero's \"Knightriders\" as a buffoonish audience member. His first featured role was in \"Creepshow\", in particular the segment \"The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill\" (King also having written the original story), where he plays the titular character. He has since made cameos in several adaptations of his works. He appeared in \"Pet Sematary\" as a minister at a funeral, in \"Thinner\" as a pharmacist, in \"Rose Red\" as a pizza deliveryman, as a news reporter in \"The Storm of the Century\", in \"The Stand\" as \"Teddy Wieszack,\" in the \"Shining\" miniseries as a band member, in \"The Langoliers\" as Tom Holby; in \"Sleepwalkers\" as the cemetery caretaker and \"Golden Years\" as a bus driver. He has also appeared in \"Chappelle's Show\" and, along with fellow author Amy Tan, on \"The Simpsons\" as himself. In addition to acting, King tried his hand at directing with \"Maximum Overdrive\", in which he also made a cameo appearance as a man using a malfunctioning ATM. King had also been approached to appear in the 1985 Romero film \"Day of the Dead\" as a zombie. Although King declined due to scheduling conflicts, a copy of one of his works makes an appearance being held by the foremost zombie \"Bub\". King would once again work with Romero in 1993 when his work \"The Dark Half\" was filmed and directed by George Romero.\n\nKing produced and acted in a television series, \"Kingdom Hospital\", which is based on the Danish miniseries \"Riget\" by Lars von Trier. He also co-wrote \"The X-Files\" season-5 episode \"Chinga\" with the creator of the series Chris Carter.\n\nKing made an appearance as a contestant on \"Celebrity Jeopardy!\" in 1995, playing to benefit the Bangor Public Library.\n\nKing provided the voice of Abraham Lincoln in the audiobook version of \"Assassination Vacation\".\n\nIn 2010, King appeared in a cameo role as a cleaner named Bachman (a reference to his pen name \"Richard Bachman\") on the FX series \"Sons of Anarchy\".\n\nThe Syfy TV series \"Haven\" is based on King's novella, \"The Colorado Kid\".\n\nOn June 19, 1999, at about 4:30 p.m., King was walking on the shoulder of Maine State Route 5, in Lovell, Maine. Driver Bryan Edwin Smith, distracted by an unrestrained dog moving in the back of his minivan, struck King, who landed in a depression in the ground about 14 feet (four meters) from the pavement of Route 5. According to Oxford County Sheriff deputy Matt Baker, King was hit from behind and some witnesses said the driver was not speeding, reckless, or drinking. In his book \"On Writing\" King states he was heading north, walking against the traffic. Shortly before the accident took place, a woman in a car also northbound passed King first and then the light blue Dodge van. The van was looping from one side of the road to the other and the woman told her passenger she hoped \"that guy in the van doesn't hit him.\"\n\nKing was conscious enough to give the deputy phone numbers to contact his family, but was in considerable pain. The author was first transported to Northern Cumberland Hospital in Bridgton and then flown by air ambulance to Central Maine Medical Center (CMMC) in Lewiston. His injuries—a collapsed right lung, multiple fractures of his right leg, scalp laceration and a broken hip—kept him at CMMC until July 9. His leg bones were so shattered that doctors initially considered amputating his leg, but stabilized the bones in the leg with an external fixator. After five operations in 10 days and physical therapy, King resumed work on \"On Writing\" in July, though his hip was still shattered and he could sit for only about 40 minutes before the pain became unbearable.\n\nKing's lawyer and two others purchased Smith's van for $1,500, reportedly to prevent it from appearing on eBay. The van was later crushed at a junkyard, much to King's disappointment, as he fantasized about smashing it up. King later mentioned during an interview with \"Fresh Air's\" Terry Gross that he wanted the vehicle destroyed at a charity event in which individuals would donate money for an opportunity to smash it with a sledgehammer.\n\nDuring this time, Tabitha King was inspired to redesign his studio. King visited the space while his books and belongings were packed away. What he saw was an image of what his studio would look like if he died, providing a seed for his novel \"Lisey's Story\" (2006).\n\nThe driver of the vehicle that struck King, Bryan Edwin Smith, was found dead at his Maine home in September 2000 in an apparent suicide. Smith had told friends shortly before that he \"could not face another winter\".\n\nIn 2002, King announced he would stop writing, apparently motivated in part by frustration with his injuries, which had made sitting uncomfortable and reduced his stamina. He has since resumed writing, but states on his Web site:\n\nIn April 2008, King spoke out against HB 1423, a bill pending in the Massachusetts state legislature that would restrict or ban the sale of violent video games to anyone under the age of 18. Although King stated that he had no personal interest in video games as a hobby, he criticized the proposed law, which he sees as an attempt by politicians to scapegoat pop culture, and to act as surrogate parents to other people's children, which he asserted is usually \"disastrous\" and \"undemocratic.\" He also saw the law as inconsistent, as it would forbid a 17-year-old, legally able to see \"\", from buying or renting \"\", which is violent but less graphic. While conceding that he saw no artistic merit in some violent video games, King also opined that such games reflect the violence that already exists in society, which would not be lessened by such a law, and would be redundant in light of the ratings system that already exists for video games. King argued that such laws allow legislators to ignore the economic divide between the rich and poor, and the easy availability of guns, which he felt were the more legitimate causes of violence. Regarding video games, he later stated that he enjoys playing light gun shooter arcade games such as \"Time Crisis\".\n\nA controversy emerged on May 5, 2008, when Noel Sheppard posted a clip of King at a Library of Congress reading event on the Web site NewsBusters. King, talking to high-school students, had said: \"If you can read, you can walk into a job later on. If you don't, then you've got the Army, Iraq, I don't know, something like that.\" The comment was described by the blog as \"another in a long line of liberal media members bashing the military,\" and likened to John Kerry's similar remark from 2006. King responded later that day, saying, \"That a right-wing-blog would impugn my patriotism because I said children should learn to read, and could get better jobs by doing so, is beneath contempt...I live in a national guard town, and I support our troops, but I don't support either the war or educational policies that limit the options of young men and women to any one career—military or otherwise.\" King again defended his comment in an interview with the \"Bangor Daily News\" on May 8, saying, \"I'm not going to apologize for promoting that kids get better education in high school, so they have more options. Those that don't agree with what I'm saying, I'm not going to change their minds.\" King later expressed regret for the remark, saying that he misspoke. He characterized the comment as originating from a \"brain cramp\", and the reality of no longer living in the world he grew up in, saying that during the Vietnam War, serving in the military was a great career for some, and for others, a sacrifice of two years of one's life. King added that he does believe that each person should be obligated to some type of government service or altruism.\n\nKing's website states that he is a supporter of the Democratic Party. During the 2008 presidential election, King voiced his support for Democratic candidate Barack Obama. King was quoted as calling conservative commentator Glenn Beck \"Satan's mentally challenged younger brother.\"\n\nOn March 8, 2011, King spoke at a political rally in Sarasota aimed against Governor Rick Scott (R-FL), voicing his opposition to the Tea Party movement.\n\nOn April 30, 2012, King published an article in \"The Daily Beast\" calling for rich Americans, including himself, to pay more taxes, citing it as \"a practical necessity and moral imperative that those who have received much should be obligated to pay ... in the same proportion\".\n\nOn January 25, 2013, King published an essay titled \"Guns\" via Amazon.com's Kindle single feature, which discusses the gun debate in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. King called for gun owners to support a ban on automatic and semi-automatic weapons, writing, \"Autos and semi-autos are weapons of mass destruction...When lunatics want to make war on the unarmed and unprepared, these are the weapons they use.\" The essay became the fifth-bestselling non-fiction title for the Kindle.\n\nKing has criticized Donald Trump and Rep. Steve King, deeming them racists.\nKing had endorsed Shenna Bellows in the 2014 U.S. Senate election for the seat held by Republican Susan Collins.\n\nKing is a public critic of Paul LePage, the Republican Governor of Maine, and has referred to LePage as one of the Three Stooges, along with Florida Governor Rick Scott and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. He was critical of LePage for incorrectly suggesting in a weekly radio address on March 18, 2015, that King avoided paying Maine income taxes by living out of state for part of the year. The statement was later corrected by the Governor's office but no apology was issued. King said LePage was \"full of the stuff that makes the grass grow green\" and demanded that LePage \"man up and apologize\". LePage declined to apologize to King, stating \"I never said Stephen King did not pay income taxes. What I said was, Stephen King's not in Maine right now. That's what I said.\" LePage further told King that he should \"make me the villain of your next book and I won't charge you royalties\".\n\nThe attention garnered by the LePage criticism has led to efforts to encourage King to run for Governor of Maine in 2018. Bangor city councilor Joe Baldacci posted on his Facebook page that he was starting a Draft Stephen King effort, and Democratic State Rep. Diane Russell launched a petition drive to encourage King to run. His spokeswoman posted to Baldacci's Facebook comment that he would likely decline to run, and King himself stated he would not run or serve on March 23 while still criticizing what he said was the \"laziness that made him mad\" about not checking his tax payments and that LePage had \"a problem finding a comfortable pair of big-boy pants\".\n\nKing sent a tweet on June 30, 2015, stating that LePage is \"a terrible embarrassment to the state I live in and love. If he won't govern, he should resign.\" He later clarified that he was not calling on LePage to resign, but to \"go to work or go back home.\" On August 27, 2016, King sent another tweet about LePage, calling him \"a bigot, a homophobe, and a racist\".\n\nKing has stated that he donates approximately $4 million per year \"to libraries, local fire departments that need updated lifesaving equipment (Jaws of Life tools are always a popular request), schools, and a scattering of organisations that underwrite the arts.\"\n\nThe Stephen and Tabitha King Foundation, chaired by the author and his wife, ranks sixth among Maine charities in terms of average annual giving with over $2.8 million in grants per year, according to The Grantsmanship Center.\n\nIn November 2011, the STK Foundation donated $70,000 in matched funding via his radio station to help pay the heating bills for families in need in his home town of Bangor, Maine, during the winter.\n\nKing married Tabitha Spruce in 1971. She too is a novelist and philanthropic activist. The couple own and divide their time between three houses: one in Bangor, Maine, one in Lovell, Maine, and for the winter a waterfront mansion located off the Gulf of Mexico in Sarasota, Florida. The Kings have three children, a daughter and two sons, and four grandchildren. Their daughter Naomi is a Unitarian Universalist Church minister in Plantation, Florida, with her lesbian partner, Rev. Dr. Thandeka. Both of the Kings' sons are authors: Owen King published his first collection of stories, \"We're All in This Together: A Novella and Stories\", in 2005. Joseph Hillstrom King, who writes as Joe Hill, published a collection of short stories, \"20th Century Ghosts\", in 2005. His debut novel, \"Heart-Shaped Box\" (2007), was optioned by Warners Bros.\n\nKing's addictions to alcohol and other drugs were so serious during the 1980s that, as he acknowledged in \"On Writing\" in 2000, he can barely remember writing \"Cujo\". Shortly after the novel's publication, King's family and friends staged an intervention, dumping on the rug in front of him evidence of his addictions taken from his office including beer cans, cigarette butts, grams of cocaine, Xanax, Valium, NyQuil, dextromethorphan (cough medicine) and marijuana. As King related in his memoir, he then sought help, quit all drugs (including alcohol) in the late 1980s, and has remained sober since. The first novel he wrote after becoming sober was \"Needful Things\".\n\nKing is a fan of baseball, and of the Boston Red Sox in particular; he frequently attends the team's home and away games, and occasionally mentions the team in his novels and stories. He helped coach his son Owen's Bangor West team to the Maine Little League Championship in 1989. He recounts this experience in the \"New Yorker\" essay \"Head Down\", which appears also in the collection \"Nightmares & Dreamscapes\". In 1999, King wrote \"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,\" featuring former Red Sox pitcher Tom Gordon as the protagonist's imaginary companion. In 2004, King co-wrote a book titled \"Faithful: Two Diehard Boston Red Sox Fans Chronicle the Historic 2004 Season\" with Stewart O'Nan, recounting the authors' roller-coaster reaction to the Red Sox's 2004 season, a season culminating in the Sox winning the 2004 American League Championship Series and World Series. In the 2005 film \"Fever Pitch,\" about an obsessive Boston Red Sox fan, King tosses out the first pitch of the Sox's opening-day game.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1739871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1739871", "title": "Talent manager", "text": "Talent manager\n\nA talent manager (also known as an artist manager, band manager or music manager) is an individual or company who guides the professional career of artists in the entertainment industry. The responsibility of the talent manager is to oversee the day-to-day business affairs of an artist; advise and counsel talent concerning professional matters, long-term plans and personal decisions which may affect their career. \n\nThe roles and responsibilities of a talent manager vary slightly from industry to industry, as do the commissions to which the manager is entitled. For example, a music manager's duties differ from those managers who advise actors, writers, or directors. A manager can also help artists find an agent, or help them decide when to leave their current agent and identify who to select as a new agent. Talent agents have the authority to make deals for their clients while managers usually can only informally establish connections with producers and studios but do not have the ability to negotiate contracts.\n\nModern talents managers are associated with all artistic fields, sports, as well as various fields in business. Talent agents have at times been covered in the music or art press almost as intently as artists themselves, for example the various talent agents who spearheaded the British Invasion of The Beatles and Herman's Hermits in the 1960s such as Brian Epstein, Allan Williams, Harvey Lisberg. Infamous examples in the music press include Allen Klein, manager of both The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. For a list of talent agents deemed notable by , see . For notable agencies and businesses, see .\n\nThe industry of talent management has been unionized or organized in several forms throughout history. In the United States, a notable early example was the Association of Talent Agents, which was formed in Los Angeles, California in 1937. The ATA comes out of the Wagner Act upheld by the Supreme Court which established many of the unions and guilds that regulate people who work in the entertainment industry such as the Screen Actors Guild, Directors Guild of America, and Writers Guild of America.\n\nA music manager (or band manager) may handle career areas for bands, singers, and DJs. A music manager may be hired by a musician or band, or the manager may discover the band, and the relationship is usually contractually bound with mutual assurances, warranties, performances guarantees, and so forth. The manager's main job is to help with determining decisions related to career moves, bookings, promotion, business deals, recording contracts, etc. The role of music managers can be extensive and may include similar duties to that of a press agent, promoter, booking agent, business manager (who are usually certified public accountants), tour managers, and sometimes even a personal assistant. \n\nManager's contracts, however, cannot license those responsibilities unto the manager in the same way a state license would empower the agent to do so. Therefore, conflicting areas of interest may arise unless those are clarified in the contract. That said, a manager should be able to read and understand and explain a contract and study up on the long-term implications of contractual agreements that they, the bands, and the people they do business with, enter into. Before the manager enters into an agreement with the band, their relationship may be regarded as competing for interest; after a good contract is signed, their interests, obligations and incentives are aligned, and the interest in success is shared. \n\nResponsibilities of a music manager are often divided among many who manage various aspects of a musical career. With an unsigned act, music managers may assume multiple roles: graphic designer, publicist, promoter, and handling money and finances. As an artist's career develops, responsibilities may grow, and because of their percentage agreement with the band, the manager's income may grow as well. \n\nA music manager becomes important to managing the many different pieces that make up a career in music. The manager can assist singers, songwriters, and instrumentalists in molding a career, finding music producers, and developing relationships with record companies, publishers, agents, and the music-loving public. They should carefully consider when certain contributions have been made which would also entitle them to cowriting credits, Executive Producer credit, or Producer credit should they become involved in songwriting, financing works, or actually producing demos and recordings, and should carefully know these jobs and these fees should be considered either as separate from the contract, in addition to the contract, or as free to the musician as clarified in emails and the contract. \n\nThe duties of an active music manager may include supporting the band's development of a reputation for the musician(s) and building a fan base, which may include mastering and launching a demo CD, developing and releasing press kits, planning promotional activities, creating social network identities for bands, and booking shows. A music manager may be present during recording sessions and should support the artist during the creative process while not interfering between the artist and the producer, but musicians may also find valuable feedback in the extra pair of ears and this should be carefully considered as well. The manager may gain access to a recording studio, photographers, and promotions. He or she will see that CD labels, posters, and promotional materials appropriately represent the band or artist, and that press kits are released in a timely manner to appropriate media. Launching a CD with complementary venues and dates is also a music manager's responsibility.\n\nAmong all the business and professional responsibilities that music managers assume; they also become a pseudo parent for the group and help with personal matters usually. This is both for the psyche of the group and to ensure that things are running smoothly. \n\nEarly on in an artist's career, the different facets of management and marketing fall upon either the band itself or, if they have one, their manager. Because the band or artist is relatively unknown initially, promotion, booking, and touring are minimal. A new music manager begins by establishing a clear understanding of what the artist(s) want. This can be accomplished through either a written or verbal contract. A music manager's first task is to solidify all artist development aspects and then concentrate on product development.\n\nDespite the dominant presence of digital media in the music industry, there are many typical strategies that even the most modernized managers must adhere to in order to reach the managerial goals effectively. Most of these trick-of-the-trade strategies are employed to establish and maintain connections with booking agents, promote the activities of the artist, and manage finances in order to optimize the artist's ability to book gigs, establish a fan base, and ultimately bring in revenue from their work, respectively.\n\nAmong the more traditional responsibilities of music managers are booking and promoting gigs for their artist(s). Managers often become known for establishing ongoing relationships with specific venues, booking one artist at the venue regularly, or several artists on their roster. A large number of 'how-to' books have been published on the topic.\n\nAs technology has advanced, the music industry has consequently undergone a drastic change in the way it operates. The internet has made it both easier and harder to attract the attention of fans and the press, as both outreach increase but industry saturation increases. “The sale of pre-recorded music has diminished, but there’s so much more that’s going on. You can’t focus on what’s not working when there are so many other opportunities.”. Social media is a common form of online networking for managers, and platforms such as MySpace, Facebook, Beatport, Bandcamp, SoundCloud, and YouTube have been noted in the press for their use in networking in the music industry. Other fields such as business may use more common websites such as LinkedIn or Google+, while networking on behalf of a client.\n\nNot everyone is so optimistic about the role of social media in the music industry. In his article, “Why Music Won’t Be Saved By Social Media”, Wes Davenport suggests that the role of social media in the industry “has been grossly inflated”. In the article, Davenport quotes Jon Ostrow saying, “Social media is a conversation tool – that’s it”, acknowledging that there is potential for sparking conversation and building a fan base, but suggesting that social media does not necessarily live up to the potential for success that people in our modern culture seem to give credit.\n\nIn an article titled, “Case study: Making money from music” by Martin Kupp, Jamie Anderson and Joerg Reckhenrich, the effects of technological advances on the music industry are recognized, analyzed, and utilized through an online marketing strategy that led to the incredible success of Lady Gaga. Troy Carter of Coalition Media signed Gaga with the intention of making her into a star with the help of some clever marketing. Recognizing that digitalization was the cause of the almost 33% decrease in the music industry’s total revenue between the years 2000 and 2007, Carter decided to find a way to use digitalization to his advantage with his newly signed artist. Coalition Media, with the help of marketing company ThinkTank Digital, invested large amounts of time and money into developing Lady Gaga’s global presence through social media. \n\nThey set up many interviews with online bloggers, established a large following on Myspace through “constant news updates, as well as exclusives, interviews and special features” and Gaga personally handled her Twitter account, building a very personal connection with many of her fans. This strategy demonstrates the massive success that skillful online marketing can produce. The article focuses on Coalition Media and Lady Gaga’s utilization of the “Four E’s”: Emotions, Experiences, Engaging, and Exclusive. By personalizing her online activity, creating an experience, engaging, and providing exclusivity to her fans through social media marketing, Lady Gaga was able to achieve incredible levels of success with her music career.\n\nStriking a tentative compensation agreement that can be renegotiated after three or four months is recommended, and the rate of pay is generally based on commissions of 20-80 percent, or more, of performance and commercial incomes. This amount depends on the level of development the band or artist is at and the experience, networks and resources of the manager. (The less developed the artist and more experienced the manager, the higher the commission.) The artist or band should never agree to circumstances that cannot be terminated or negotiated within a short period of time.\n\nManagers usually secure the services of a professional photographer while the artist is recording. Different 8x10 pictures of the artist can be used for websites, CD labels/jackets, posters, and the press kit. Cost for high quality shoots vary from $500 for a basic shoot to thousands for several looks. Photographers are not expected to cover material cost. It is important that the manager obtains an agreement upfront confirming license to use the images which will cover the uses necessary, in addition to high resolution digital images on CD. Managers are also advised to have photographs taken before CD designs or artwork goes into production. Managers are also responsible for hiring additional staff when necessary.\n\n"}
{"id": "20179370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20179370", "title": "The Awakening Conscience", "text": "The Awakening Conscience\n\nThe Awakening Conscience (1853) is an oil-on-canvas painting by the English artist William Holman Hunt, one of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, which depicts a young woman rising from her position in the lap of a man and gazing transfixed out of the window of a room.\n\nThe painting is in the collection of the Tate Britain in London.\n\nInitially, the painting appears to depict a momentary disagreement between husband and wife, but the title and a host of symbols within the painting make it clear that this is a mistress and her lover. The woman's clasped hands provide a focal point and the position of her left hand emphasizes the absence of a wedding ring. Around the room are dotted reminders of her \"kept\" status and her wasted life: the cat beneath the table toying with a bird; the clock concealed under glass; a tapestry which hangs unfinished on the piano; the threads which lie unravelled on the floor; the print of Frank Stone's \"Cross Purposes\" on the wall; Edward Lear's musical arrangement of Tennyson's poem \"Tears, Idle Tears\" which lies discarded on the floor, and the music on the piano, Thomas Moore's \"Oft in the Stilly Night\", the words of which speak of missed opportunities and sad memories of a happier past. The discarded glove and top hat thrown on the table top suggest a hurried assignation.\n\nThe room is too cluttered and gaudy to be in a Victorian family home; the bright colours, unscuffed carpet, and pristine, highly polished furniture speak of a room recently furnished for a mistress. Art historian Elizabeth Prettejohn notes that although the interior is now viewed as \"Victorian\" it still exudes the \"'nouveau-riche' vulgarity\" that would have made the setting distasteful to contemporary viewers. The painting's frame is decorated with further symbols: bells (for warning), marigolds (for sorrow), and a star above the girl's head (a sign of spiritual revelation). It also bears a verse from the Book of Proverbs (25:20): \"As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart\".\n\nThe mirror on the rear wall provides a tantalizing glimpse out of the scene. The window — opening out onto a spring garden, in direct contrast to the images of entrapment within the room — is flooded with sunlight. The woman's face does not display a look of shock that she has been surprised with her lover; whatever attracts her is outside of both the room and her relationship. The \"Athenæum\" commented in 1854:\n\nIn some ways this painting is a companion to Hunt's Christian painting \"The Light of the World\", a picture of Christ holding a lantern as he knocks on an overgrown handleless door which Hunt said represented \"the obstinately shut mind\". The young woman here could be responding to that image, her conscience pricked by something outside of herself. Hunt intended this image to be \"The Light of the World\"'s \"material counterpart in a picture representing in actual life the manner in which the appeal of the spirit of heavenly love calls a soul to abandon a lower life.\" In \"Pre-Raphaelitism and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood\" Hunt wrote that Peggotty's search for Emily in \"David Copperfield\" had given him the idea for the composition and he began to visit \"different haunts of fallen girls\" looking for a suitable setting. He did not plan to recreate any particular scene from \"David Copperfield\"; he initially wanted to capture something more general: \"the loving seeker of the fallen girl coming upon the object of his search\", but he reconsidered, deciding that such a meeting would engender different emotions in the girl than the repentance he wanted to show. He eventually settled on the idea that the girl's companion could be singing a song that suddenly reminded her of her former life and thereby act as the unknowing catalyst for her epiphany.\n\nThe model for the girl was Annie Miller, who sat for many of the Pre-Raphaelites and to whom Hunt was engaged until 1859. The male figure may be based on Thomas Seddon or Augustus Egg, both painter friends of Hunt.\n\nThe look on the girl's face in the modern painting is not the look of pain and horror that viewers saw when the painting was first exhibited, and which shocked and repulsed many of the contemporary critics. The painting was commissioned by Thomas Fairbairn, a Manchester industrialist and patron of the Pre-Raphaelites, after Egg discussed Hunt's ideas and possibly showed him some of the initial sketches. Fairbairn paid Hunt 350 guineas. The painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1854, along with \"The Light of the World\". Fairbairn found himself unable to bear looking on the woman's expression day-to-day, so persuaded Hunt to soften it. Hunt started work but fell ill and allowed the painting to be returned to Fairbairn for display at the Birmingham Society of Artists exhibition in 1856 before he was completely happy with the result. Later he was able to work on it again and confided to Edward Lear that he thought he had \"materially bettered it\". As noted in the spandrels, Hunt retouched the painting in 1864 and again in 1886 when he repaired some work that had been carried out by a restorer in the interim.\n\nThe Victorian art theorist John Ruskin praised \"The Awakening Conscience\" as an example of a new direction in British art in which the narrative was created from the artist's imagination rather than chronicling an event. Ruskin's reading of the painting was also to a moral end. In an 1854 letter to \"The Times\" defending the work, he claimed that there is \"not a single object in all that room...but it becomes tragical if read rightly\". He was struck by both the stark realism of the room — Hunt had hired a room in a \"maison de convenance\" (where lovers would take their mistresses) in order to capture the feeling — and the symbolic overtones and compared the revelation of the subjects' characters through the interiors favourably with that of William Hogarth's \"Marriage à-la-mode\". \nThe \"common, modern, vulgar\" interior is overwhelmed by lustrous, unworn objects that will never be part of a home. To Ruskin, the exquisite detail of the painting only called attention to the inevitable ruin of the couple: \"The very hem of the poor girl's dress, at which the painter has laboured so closely, thread by thread, has story in it, if we think how soon its pure whiteness may be soiled with dust and rain, her outcast feet failing in the street\". The idea of a visual morality tale, based on a single moment, influenced Augustus Egg's 1858 series of three paintings, \"Past and Present\".\n\nIn Evelyn Waugh's \"Brideshead Revisited\", an allusion to the painting reflects the unraveling of the affair between Julia Flyte and artist Charles Ryder. \n\nThe painting was inherited by Fairbairn's son, Sir Arthur Henderson Fairbairn, 3rd Baronet. It was sold anonymously at Christie's in January 1946 and had been bought by Colin Anderson by 1947. It was donated to the Tate Gallery by Sir Colin and Lady Anderson in 1976.\n\n"}

She then pours gasoline around the bed in which Mickey is sleeping in their home in Dansville, Michigan, and sets the bed afire. After the house catches fire, Hughes drives with her children to the local police station in order to confess to the act. Hughes is tried for first degree murder, and is found by a jury of her peers to be not guilty by reason of temporary insanity.

{"id": "38458720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38458720", "title": "The Little Princess and the Poet", "text": "The Little Princess and the Poet\n\nThe Little Princess and the Poet is one of Evelyn Sharp's many fairytales, written in 1898.This short children's story sends the message that beauty is not always seen on the surface but found within the heart of a person. It is part of Sharp's popular story collection, \"All the Way to Fairyland\".\n\nThere once was a poet who was unable to do anything useful and instead spent all of his time writing poetry. Unfortunately, the poet was not particularly nice to look at and was often sent away because people could not bear to look at his ugly features. As a result, he traveled from place to place singing his poetry to people who did not listen. During his travels the poet visited a city he had never been to before and, as usual, he went immediately to the poor, because it was about them that he always wrote. When they heard his poetry they grumbled and asked why he was telling them about their woes when they already knew all about them. Then they sent him up to the palace because the Princess was blind and enjoyed listening to poetry all day.\nThrilled that he was finally wanted somewhere, the poet went to the palace immediately. Upon his arrival, the guards at the gate initially turned him away because he was not as attractive as all of the other poets that had been to see the blind Princess. Luckily, the Princess heard the poet at the gate and sensed that he was a real poet - unlike all of the princes who claimed to be poets. She took the poet by the hand and took him up to the palace where the entire court was just sitting down to lunch.\nThe King and Queen, however, were less than overjoyed by the poets sudden appearance in their court. Despite their attempts to convince her, the Princess was adamant that he stay. Over lunch, the poet sang a poem about the poor and the hardships that they face. When he was done, everyone was stunned, and the forty five princes who claimed to be poets stood up and left, knowing that they were not real poets. When the Queen had recovered from the surprise, she tried to persuade the Princess that the poet had to leave because he was not suitable company for a Princess. Despite her objections, the poet knew it was true and told the Princess that he had to leave.\n\nThe poet went back to traveling, and one day came to a place far away from the blind Princess and sang of his love for her to the poor. When he was done, they told him that if he kissed the Princess on each eyelid while she was sleeping, her blindness would be cured, even though she had been blind since birth. He hurried back to the palace of the blind Princess and told her parents his purpose. Although they were unsure, they were also intrigued and agreed to let him try, on the condition that he left immediately after kissing her. Conveniently, the Princess was asleep in the garden at the time and the poet was able to kiss her. When she awoke, the Princess was no longer blind and asked to see all the beauty that she had been missing. However, nothing that she saw looked beautiful to her and she instead decided that she wanted to see something ugly. When she was told that there was nothing ugly in the Palace, the Princess went outside and came upon the poet who had been unable to stay away, and looking at him she finally found beauty.\n\nEvelyn Sharp (suffragist) born August 4, 1869, to a privileged family in London; She was the ninth of eleven children. Sharp was taught by her elder sisters before attending school in London, then attending a college in Paris in 1890. She is well known for both her children’s stories as well as her involvement as a suffragist. A versatile writer, Sharp was popular for writing schoolgirl fictions and fairy tales. Her schoolgirl tales were primarily based on her happy days in school, which Sharp recorded in her collection \"The Youngest Girl in the School\". In her fairy tales, Sharp was known to appeal to the minds of children. Her attitude towards children was not patronizing, but respectful; she treated them as creative and intelligent and appealed to this aspect in her stories. She empathized with children, and viewed adults as irrational and strange. Her fairy tales were not moralistic and instead focused on issues of the day, like her changing views of gender, class, internationalism, and peace. Sharp also worked for the Manchester Guardian as a journalist for four decades and became the first regular contributor to its popular Women’s page. Her involvement in the suffrage movement began before the First World War. Sharp was involved in two major suffragist societies in Britain: the militant Women’s Social and Political Union and the United Suffragists, the latter of which she was a founder. Sharp edited the controversial newspaper \"Votes for Women\". Her work as a pacifist and international humanitarian lead her to work with the Quakers in Weimar Germany, in the 1920s. She was twice imprisoned and refused to pay taxes on the grounds that as she did not have the vote therefore she should not have to pay. At the age of sixty-three, she married long time friend and fellow suffragist, Henry Nevinson. Sharp died in 1955 at the age of 86.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "58585039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58585039", "title": "Theatre Royal, Barnwell, Cambridge", "text": "Theatre Royal, Barnwell, Cambridge\n\nThe Theatre Royal was built in the Barnwell suburb of Cambridge, England, in 1816. It closed later that century but reopened as the Cambridge Festival Theatre from 1926 until 1935. The building, in which part of the interior of the theatre survives, is Grade II* listed.\n\nWilliam Wilkins (1751–1815), a building contractor, was proprietor of a chain of theatres in East Anglia known as the Norwich circuit. Performers included the Norwich Company of Comedians, and performances had been given since the late 18th century on Stourbridge Common, north of the city of Cambridge, at the annual Stourbridge fair. Wilkins and his son, also William (1778–1839), built a theatre in 1807 at Sun Street, Barnwell. The younger Wilkins – a prominent architect who had designed Downing College and went on to work at other colleges and the National Gallery – designed a new theatre nearby to replace the 1807 building.\n\nThe building is on the south side of the Newmarket Road in the northeastern Cambridge suburb of Barnwell. Completed in 1816, the theatre was sited outside the boundary of the town owing to prohibition of theatrical entertainment by the University authorities (a 1737 act \"for the More Effectual Preventing the Unlawful Playing of Interludes within the Precincts of the Two Universities ...\" forbade the performance of all plays and operas within five miles of the town).\n\nOn his father's death in 1815, Wilkins inherited the leases of the new site and six other theatres – Norwich, Bury St Edmunds, Colchester, Yarmouth, Ipswich and King's Lynn – and continued to run them. Proprietorship passed to his son, W Bushby Wilkins, and a succession of lessees, but the Norwich circuit declined. The theatre closed in 1878 and became a nonconformist chapel.\n\nTerence Gray (1895–1986) leased the building in 1926 and reopened it as the Cambridge Festival Theatre. The alleyway between the street and the building was enclosed to form a foyer. The interior was modernised, with the proscenium arch widened by the removal of the private boxes, and the introduction of electric lighting, a brick cyclorama and an early example of a revolving stage. The theatre was the country's \"first permanent indoor performing space to be based on the design of a Greek open-air theatre\".\n\nThe 'Festival' name reflected Grey's intention (unfulfilled) to promote summer festivals. The opening production on 22 November 1926 was \"Oresteia\", with choreography by Ninette de Valois.\n\nGrey retired from the theatre in 1933 and went on to write on Taoism under the pseudonym \"Wei Wu Wei\". Norman Marshall worked at the theatre from 1926 and was its director from 1932 to 1933.\n\nFrom 1927, Joseph Macleod was an actor and producer at the theatre, and in 1933 he became the theatre's director and lessee. Five of Macleod's plays were staged there, including \"Overture to Cambridge\" (1933) and \"A Woman Turned to Stone\" (1934). Under Macleod, the theatre became known for its avant-garde productions, and staging of lesser known works by great playwrights. Macleod staged some of Ezra Pound's Noh plays, and also some Ibsen and Chekhov (his company, The Cambridge Festival Players, was one of the first in the UK to stage Chekhov's play \"The Seagull\").

{"id": "11333872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11333872", "title": "Universal Creative", "text": "Universal Creative\n\nUniversal Creative is the master planning, creative development, design, engineering, project management, and research and development division of Universal Parks & Resorts, a division of NBCUniversal.Universal Creative is composed of artists, architects, engineers, designers, producers, builders, writers and more who conceive, design and build all of the attractions, rides, theme parks and resorts for Universal Parks & Resorts. \n\nFrom 1968 until 1997, Universal Creative was known as MCA Planning and Development, working as part of Universal's recreation division. In 1997, when Universal parent MCA was sold to Seagram and dropped the MCA name, the company was renamed Universal Creative. Originally located in Universal City, California, the company moved to Universal Orlando in 2001. In 2011, Comcast purchased NBCUniversal, incorporating Universal Parks & Resorts and Universal Creative into its portfolio.\n\nUniversal Creative designed and created attractions such as The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man (1999), Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey (2010), and Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts (2014), and has numerous patents on file for additional attractions and innovations. Thierry Coup, Universal Creative’s Senior Vice President of the Creative Studio, describes the philosophy: \n\nUniversal Creative's The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man is a dark ride using advanced audio, with the sound accurate to ⅕ of a video frame. “All of your visceral, aural and visual input has to be in perfect sync,” says Steve Blum, Senior Vice President of Ride Safety and Engineering. “Humans are very sensitive to anomalies in their environment: If you don’t give them the right input, they detect right away that it’s not real.” Universal Creative partnered with Oceaneering International to create a 12-passenger motion-base simulator pod capable of six degrees of freedom (heave, sway, surge, yaw, pitch, and roll) and 360-degree rotation (achieved with a ring and pinion gear system), all contained in an angled shell to direct riders' view. Universal Creative’s Phil Hettema and William Mason received inventor credits on the ride system patent, known as the SCOOP.\n\nUniversal Creative employees Scott Trowbridge and Thierry Coup storyboarded a scene-by-scene breakdown of the ride that would be projected onto thirteen 30-foot tall projection screens integrated with physical sets. Because guests would be moving toward, away from, or past these 3D screens, animators had to consider the perspective shift that viewers would actually encounter if these really. They developed a new process they called “squinching”, used to account for a viewer’s moving sightline and distorting the animation to match.\n\nCreated for the Islands of Adventure theme park that opened on May 28, 1999, The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man won \"Amusement Today\"s Golden Ticket Award for Best Dark Ride for twelve consecutive years from 1999 through to 2010. It has since placed second in that category, after fellow Islands of Adventure attraction, Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, took the top spot in 2011. In 2000, the ride won a Thea Award from the Themed Entertainment Association for outstanding themed entertainment and experience design. It has also won numerous public-voted Theme Park Insider Awards and Screamscape Ultimate Awards. The ride has been duplicated a Universal Studios Japan, which opened in January 2004.\n\nHarry Potter and the Forbidden Journey opened in June 2010 as part of the Hogsmeade area at Islands of Adventure. It features robotic arms as a ride vehicle which are mounted on a track, to travel through the attraction while performing their movements in synchronization with the ride's show elements (animated props, projection surfaces, and so on). In \"Amusement Today\"'s annual Golden Ticket Awards, Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey debuted as the best new ride of 2010. It won the Best Dark Ride category for five consecutive years from 2011 to 2015. Due to the massive popularity of the ride, it was duplicated at Universal Studios Japan (which opened on July 18, 2014) and Universal Studios Hollywood (which opened on April 7, 2016).\n\nHarry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts is a steel roller coaster that opened on July 8, 2014 at Universal Studios Florida. It encompasses motion-based vehicles, detailed sets, physical effects, and 3D projection screens similar to those found on \"\" and \"The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man\". The ride takes guests through the vaults of Gringotts, where they meet several characters from the \"Harry Potter\" films and have a face-to-face encounter with Lord Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange In \"Amusement Today\"'s annual Golden Ticket Awards, Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts has made it into the Top Five Dark Rides since it opened in 2014.\n\n"}
{"id": "304829", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=304829", "title": "Wesley Willis", "text": "Wesley Willis\n\nWesley Lawrence Willis (May 31, 1963 – August 21, 2003) was an American singer-songwriter and visual artist. Diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1989, Willis began a career as an underground singer-songwriter in the outsider music tradition, with songs featuring his bizarre, humorous and often obscene lyrics sung over the auto accompaniment feature on his Technics KN keyboard.\n\nWillis gained a large cult following in the 1990s, particularly after the release of his 1995 \"Greatest Hits\" album on the Alternative Tentacles label. Jello Biafra compiled the album's track list. In addition to a large body of solo musical work, Willis fronted his own punk rock band, the Wesley Willis Fiasco, during the 1990s. He was also a visual artist long before he developed an interest in music, and produced hundreds of intricate, unusual, colored ink-pen drawings, most of them of various Chicago streetscapes; he frequently sold these on the street for between $20 and $40.\n\nDespite his mainly underground career, Willis has influenced a variety of media: for example, music software company Nullsoft took their slogan \"It really whips the llama's ass!\" for Winamp from Willis's song \"Whip The Llama's Ass\".\n\nWillis was born in Chicago, Illinois on May 31, 1963, to Walter and Annie Willis. According to the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"Willis grew up in Chicago's projects as one of 10 children of parents who had a violent relationship and separated when he was young; he spent time in several foster homes and was essentially raised by two older brothers, who went with him from home to home.\" Willis began hearing voices during a period of living at his mother's home in the 1980s, when her boyfriend held a gun to his head and robbed him of $100 Willis had saved. By the end of the 1980s, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and institutionalized for two months after his diagnosis.\n\nDuring childhood, Willis developed an interest in art, and in 1988, he was featured in a Chicago public access documentary feature entitled \"Wesley Willis: Artist of the Streets\". In \"Artist of the Streets\", he was shown walking through Chicago's Loop neighborhood, producing his ink pen drawings outside of the Marshall Field and Company Building, and interacting with people curious about his art. The drawings typically encompass detailed Chicago streetscapes, including buildings, vehicles, trees, and landmarks. Willis was known for his ability to draw from memory a completely different location than the one in which he was sitting. During his lifetime, he frequently gave his drawings away to friends or sold them for small amounts (typically $10 or $20) in Chicago parks. However, after his death, Willis began to receive recognition in the art community for his large body of visual art. In 2008 his artwork was exhibited at the Mohamed Khalil Museum of Egypt, and he was the subject of a special exhibit entitled \"Drawn By Wesley Willis\" at Dominican University.\n\nIn 1991, after befriending some musicians from Chicago's alternative rock scene and recording several solo albums, he formed the punk rock band The Wesley Willis Fiasco. The band developed a popular underground following as well as attention from musicians such as Eddie Vedder, Henry Rollins, Mike D., Jello Biafra, and the members of White Zombie; and soon caught the attention of Rick Rubin at American Recordings, an independent label distributed by The Warner Group. In early 1994, Willis recorded with the Canadian industrial-metal band Monster Voodoo Machine and appeared on their Juno Award-winning debut album \"Suffersystem\" (RCA Records). In 1995, American Recordings signed Willis as a solo musician; the Wesley Willis Fiasco subsequently broke up in 1996. He went on to record numerous solo albums of novelty rock (two for American Recordings and the remainder for several independent labels or recorded, marketed and released independently by Willis himself), toured frequently, and was profiled on MTV. On September 26, 1996, he was a guest on \"The Howard Stern Show\" where he played nearly identical songs about Baba Booey and Howard Stern. During his many tours and live appearances, Willis became \"famous for greeting fans with a headbutt\"; this left him with a distinctive permanent bruise on his forehead.\n\nIn early 2003 the documentary \"The Daddy of Rock 'n' Roll\" was released, chronicling Willis' daily life and interests.\n\nOn August 21, 2003, Willis died due to complications from chronic myelogenous leukemia in Skokie, Illinois.\n\nIn 2013, a supporting character named Milan was introduced for the ongoing Wonder Woman comic. A blind demigod with the power of far-sight and half-brother to Wonder Woman, his physical appearance and mannerisms are based on Wesley Willis.\n\n\"Hellride\" is the term used by Willis to describe his encounters with \"demons\", which occurred mainly on the CTA bus lines in Chicago. According to Willis, his demons were trying to ruin his \"Harmony Joy Music\" or \"Joy Rides\". He uses the term in many of his songs, such as \"I Deserve a Warhellride\".\n\nThe Wesley Willis Fiasco songs were punk rock songs with Willis howling his obscene, absurd rants as lyrics. The band recorded three cover songs: Thin Lizzy's \"Jailbreak\", Pure Prairie League's \"Amie\", and Duran Duran's \"Girls on Film\", the last of which was recorded for a 1997 Duran Duran tribute album. Another song by the Wesley Willis Fiasco, \"The Bar Is Closed\", recreates a section of Rush's \"Tom Sawyer\"; the song \"Casper the Homosexual Friendly Ghost\" does the same with Van Halen's \"Jamie's Cryin'\".\n\nAs a solo artist, Willis filled his albums with funny, bizarre, tense, and often obscene statements about crime, fast food, cultural trends, bus routes, violent confrontations with superheroes, commands for his \"demons\" to engage in bestiality (in \"The Daddy of Rock 'n' Roll\", Willis explained that these songs would \"gross out\" the demons enough to leave him alone), and praise for his favorite actors, friends, politicians, and hip hop and rock artists. Songs about rock artists were usually confined to describing a show performed by the band that Willis had attended or opened for, recycling key phrases such as \"The crowd roared like a lion,\" \"A lot of people met the band,\" or \"The band got down like a Magikist\". Many songs end with the phrase \"Rock over London, rock on, Chicago,\" followed by a product slogan, such as \"Wheaties. Breakfast of Champions\" or \"Blockbuster. Wow! What a difference.\"\n\nCritic Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic wrote that despite Willis' prolific output his songs were essentially variations on the same simple structure, melody and lyrical themes. He also questioned record company motives for releasing albums by Willis: \"It's certainly admirable that Willis has decided to not be tied down by his schizophrenia, but it often seems that his audience is laughing at him, not with him.\" Erlewine also wrote that listening to a Willis record felt \"exploitive\".\n\n"}
