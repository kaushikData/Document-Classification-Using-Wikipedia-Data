Her 1978 bequest to the British Museum comprised some of the finest netsuke and European decorative arts received by that museum.\n\nAnne Ullmann was born in Nuremberg, Germany in 1926 in a Jewish banking family. Forced to emigrate following the advent of the Nazis, her family settled in Northampton. Her father's company Mettoy became famous for its metal toys, including the Corgi line of cars.\n\nShe has family wealth as well as income from the Keyser-Ullmann bank and this enabled Ulmann to collect art from the age of 11, especially ivory, ceramics, metalwork and jewellery.\n\nShe married John Hull Grundy, an entomologist and artist, in 1949. Shortly thereafter, she was debilitated by a chronic respiratory illness. Her purchases of fine art continued, with trusted dealers bringing the works to her sickbed. In many cases, she bought works via mail.\n\nHer focus of collection became European jewellery and Japanese ivory.\n\nA 1976 catalogue of an exhibition of decorative arts at the British Museum (\"Jewellery through 7000 years\") made Grundy realise that the museum's collection ended in the 1700s. She resolved to update their holdings by acquiring 18th and 19th century objects. In 1978, she donated a large part of her collection to the British Museum. This possibly comprised the best of her collections as she had separately donated fine pieces to other museums in the UK, including the Fitzwilliam in Cambridge, Manchester and Glasgow. Some of the major pieces included a 1559 silver roundel by Lambert Suavius commemorating the Peace of Cateau-Cambresis, and silver portrait medallions of Elizabeth I and James I by Simon de Passe. There were also cameos by Italian masters, Pistrucci, Berini and Girometti. The value of her donation stemmed from the good documentation of the art works, especially those from European and American engravers and designers. From her Japanese collections were \"jizai okimono\", articulated iron animals, as well as netsuke.\n\nAnother recipient of Grundy's gift was the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow, which obtained nearly a thousand pieces of jewellery tracing the history of European jewellery over a period of two centuries. This included an Italian miniature Aladdin's lamp brooch from 1860 and English fuchsia gold and ivory drop earrings from 1835.\n\nGrundy wrote articles on the decorative arts both for the specialist and the popular press. Between 1958-1961, she contributed a 'collectors' column for \"The Times\".\n\nGrundy's husband died in 1984. She died the same year.\n"}

It emerged from the intense cultural activity that makes Athens one of the most interesting places for contemporary art, and it aims to be an agent of constant change and innovation, provide a context for creativity and dialogue and constitute a wide platform for the designation and the critical engagement of local artistic production, as well as a forum for discussion and exchange with the international scene.\n\nIt has presented so far five editions: \"Destroy Athens\" (2007), \"Heaven\" (2009), \"Monodrome\" (2011), \"Agora\" (2013), \"Omonoia\" (June 2015-February 2017), as well as the prelude of AB6 \"Waiting for the Barbarians\" (April 2017).

From 1973 to 2006, Audio Arts published 25 volumes of 4 issues of the Audio Arts Cassettes (later releasing LPs and CDs as well). Furlong conducted all interviews until 1996, when Jean Wainwright took the baton as interviewer. Each interview starts with \"I am here with...\", stating artist's name and recording location. Interviewees include: Andy Warhol, Anish Kapoor, Joseph Beuys, Gilbert & George, Yoko Ono, R. Buckminster Fuller, Hermann Nitsch, Mario Merz, Gerhard Richter, Nam June Paik, as well as an interview with WB Yeats' daughter and readings by Yeats himself (in Vol.1 Issue #4, 1974).\n\nWilliam Furlong was part of a generation of British artists of the 1960s-70s including Gilbert & George, Richard Hamilton, Bruce McLean or Paul Richards (whose Nice Style performance group was the first pose band) who were consciously moving from traditional art forms to conceptual art, performance, new media, cheap materials, in a dematerialized and process-oriented ethos. Furlong is now a sound artist with sound installations exhibited in Lisbon (\"Walls of Sound\", 1998), Bexhill on Sea, Sussex (\"Anthem\", 2009), Genillard Gallery, London (\"Possibility & Impossibility of Fixing Meaning\", 2009).\nWith the acquisition of the Audio Arts archive by Tate in 2004 (itself a long-time subscriber to Audio Arts cassettes releases),\nover 200 boxes of master tapes used to edit the magazine are now secured for future researchers. A selection was exhibited at Tate Britain March–August 2007. The archive is now catalogued, digitized and preserved there.\n\nIn October–December 2006, a retrospective exhibition curated by Lucia Farinati took place at Rome’s Sound Art Museum showing a selection of Audio Arts releases and adding a new sound art by Furlong: \"Conversation Pieces\", a reworking/remixing of preview Furlong interviews, making famous interviewees respond to each other by the magic of cut-up. See \nSlashSeconds.org.\n\nWilliam Furlong's Audio Arts project was featured in the \"See This Sound (Promises in Sound and Vision)\" exhibition, curated by Cosima Rainer, August 28, 2009 to January 10, 2010, Lentos Kunstmuseum, Linz, Austria.\n\nLike other audio magazine publishers, William Furlong took full advantage of the cassette medium as the most efficient way to spread his material the world over. The cassette was indeed the most pertinent medium for various reasons:\n\nSome of the interviewees were themselves great defenders of the cassette medium, like Lawrence Weiner and Dieter Roth. In an interview with Ilari Valbonesi, Furlong says he considered the cassette medium as a radical form of communication back in 1973. What he means by \"radical\" can be figured out from this Jean Wainwright recollection: \n\n\"I am reminded of Vito Acconci's work \"Face Off\" (1973) where he listens attentively to his own-recorded voice on an audio tape player telling of extremely intimate moments in his life. When the confessional material becomes too highly charged for him he cries out over the taped voice, 'no don't tell this, don't reveal this,' his dramatic response to his conflicting drives between self-revelation and self-concealment.\"\n"}
{"id": "19135715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19135715", "title": "Birmingham Arts Lab", "text": "Birmingham Arts Lab\n\nThe Birmingham Arts Laboratory or Arts Lab was an experimental arts centre and artist collective based in Birmingham, England from 1968 to 1982 – an \"arts and performance space dedicated to radical research into art and creativity\". Loosely organised and biased towards the obscure and avant-garde, it was described by \"The Guardian\" in 1997 as \"one of the emblematic institutions of the 1960s\".\n\nThe Arts Lab was originally based in a run-down youth centre run by The Birmingham Settlement on Tower Street in Newtown on the northern edge of Birmingham City Centre, and was accessible from the street only via a metal fire escape. It moved to a former brewery on Holt Street in Gosta Green in 1977, before financial problems and pressure from the arts establishment forced it to amalgamate with and take over Aston University's Centre for the Arts on Gosta Green to form the more conventional Triangle Arts Centre in 1982.\n\nThe Birmingham Arts Lab had a wide influence across numerous art forms. Figures involved with the Arts Lab, often early in their careers, included cartoonists Hunt Emerson, Edward Barker, Kevin O'Neill, Bryan Talbot, Steve Bell and Suzy Varty; playwrights David Edgar and David Hare; film director Mike Figgis; writer and poet Gareth Owen; comedian and performance artist John Dowie; photographer and journalist Derek Bishton; the psychedelic group Bachdenkel; novelist Jim Crace; singer Ruby Turner, film maker and photographer Pogus Caesar and composer and sonic artist Trevor Wishart.\n\nThe genesis of the Birmingham Arts Laboratory can be traced to a meeting on 8 September 1968, of five figures (Mark Williams, Fred Smith, Dave Cassidy, Tony Jones and Bob Sheldon) from the Midlands Arts Centre, who had been promoting avant garde music performances at the centre's outdoor auditorium and had been involved in Mike Leigh's experiments in improvised theatre, but had become frustrated at what they saw as the bureaucracy and obstructionism of the centre's management. The group resolved to start a breakaway venue to \"provide a centre for experimenting in the Arts; be a community of creative people, self-aware and self-supporting; participate creatively in the life of the City; and present work of both its members and visiting groups and individuals\"\n\nThere followed five months of fund-raising events around the city called Strange Days and featuring bands such as Fleetwood Mac, Colosseum and DJ John Peel (whose fundraising efforts saw him became the Arts Lab's first life member), during which a local charity offered the group the use of a first floor room in its Newtown Youth Centre as a venue. The Arts Lab opened in January 1969, initially only at weekends.\n\nTerry Grimley, later arts correspondent of the \"Birmingham Post\", recalled \"When I first found my way to the Arts Lab, it did not resemble an arts centre so much as a night club with a rather different ambience to other places in town. Nothing happened except at weekends, and not much happened then either, except that music was played, coloured lights were projected and people ate vegetables and brown rice and drank instant coffee.\"\n\nThe Arts Lab was open full-time from April 1969. Initially occupying only a single room, it quickly established cinema and theatre programmes and in its first year held two experimental arts festivals – \"Cybervironment Plus\" organised by Simon Chapman and \"Gathering Number One\" organised by Pete Stark. Funding from the Arts Council from 1971 secured its future and saw it gradually expand: firstly to occupy the whole first floor (with the gymnasium becoming the main theatre and performance space), and eventually to occupy the entire building.\n\nThe Arts Lab was initially run along the lines of a club for members and guests. Although it never had a drinks licence (due to constant friction with the local licensing authorities) it had a coffee bar, beneath which was a void between the floors in which several members intermittently lived. Jim Crace later recalled that \"it was no surprise to discover a badly-smelling playwright or drink-wrecked mime artist emerging between your legs from a priest hole below the floorboards\".\n\nThe Arts Lab started with no formal organisation, but with Peter Stark as unofficial administrator. Stark left in 1970 and was replaced by Simon Chapman, who left in 1972 to become the Director of the Ikon Gallery and was replaced by Ted Little. Little was to be artistic director through to 1982, apart from a two-year spell as head of the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, during which he transformed it \"from a club for the self-absorbed of Kensington to a roaring popular venue\" and paved the way for its important role in the early years of British punk.\n\nThe Arts Lab's earlier chaotic, co-operative organisation was increasingly challenged by funders from 1975 onwards, with a formal Board of Management being established in 1976. August 1977 saw the Arts Lab move completely from Tower Street to new, much larger premises in a former brewery on the campus of Aston University, with a bookshop, studios and exhibition spaces. Shortage of funds meant that not all of the planned facilities were finished, however, and the new more orderly surroundings were felt by some to have compromised the Arts Lab's uniquely liberating culture.\n\nThe first signs of problems became apparent in 1980 when two members of the music staff were made redundant and Ted Little left to pursue freelance work. The Arts Lab's programme began to focus increasingly on film to the exclusion of other media. In 1982 West Midlands Arts sponsored a move to combine the Arts Lab with Aston University's own Centre for the Arts (with the resultant demise of the Centre for the Arts, which had previously been a popular, thriving, live performance arts venue) as a venue focussing primarily on cinema and photography, and in 1983 the Arts Lab's premises reopened as a new Arts Centre called the Triangle Media and Arts Centre. Funding for this was removed in 1987, however, and the cinema finally closed in 1994.\n\nThe Arts Lab's theatre programme was controversial from its start in 1969, with a nude open-air performance on the Arts Lab's roof by the theatre company Sweetness and Light attracting headlines in the \"Birmingham Post\". By 1971 there was a regular programme of visiting theatre companies - mainly radical performance art groups such as the People Show, Pip Simmons Theatre Group and John Bull Puncture Repair Kit - together with performances by the Arts Lab's own theatre company Zoo.\n\nA regular Theatre Workshop was established from 1973, and the following years saw a series of plays written specifically for the Arts Lab including John Dowie's \"Stillsmith\", Gareth Owen's \"Confession of Jon-Jak Crusoe\" and his rock operetta \"Rupert\", Bruce Lacey and Jill Bruce's \"Stella Superstar and Her Amazing Intergalactic Adventures\" and most notably David Edgar's \"Summer Sports\", later revived as \"Blood Sports\" and still widely performed.\n\nBetween 1972 and 1976 the Performance Group - based at the Arts Lab but touring internationally - produced a range of shows that combined dance, film, text, poetry, electronics and ambient music; declaring \"Total Theatre, Mixed or Multimedia, Compound Theatre are all terms we use in this connection\", and from 1976 the Writers' Theatre Company provided an outlet for the professional production of work by young local writers. The Arts Lab was also notable as a comedy venue, with Stewart Lee crediting Victoria Wood and John Dowie's work at the Arts Lab as being one of the earliest roots of the later alternative comedy movement.\nJanice Connolly, who later became comedy character Mrs Barbara Nice, performed at Tower Street in a piece directed by John Dowie from a Hunt Emerson cartoon \"Dog Man\".\n\nThe Arts Lab's cinema programme was established by Tony Jones – the first film shown being \"Medium Cool\" by Haskell Wexler, which had never before seen in the UK – and it continued after the programmes in most other media went into decline from 1980 onwards. The reputation of the Arts Lab's Tower Street venue as \"the world's most uncomfortable cinema, the silence only broken by the accompaniment of some thrasher on the piano and the timpani of scurrying rats\" was partly explained by the fact that the seating had been bought second-hand from a local cinema. In addition to its regular programme the Arts Lab held an annual Film Festival from 1972, focussing on particular themes including film makers such as Kenneth Anger, Josef von Sternberg or F. W. Murnau, or 1976's focus on Polish Cinema. Jones left the Arts Lab in 1978 to join the Cambridge Film Theatre.\n\nThe Arts Lab's music programme was defiantly aimed at \"presenting contemporary music in Birmingham on a regular basis, regardless of the support it may or may not receive\", starting off with a then-unusual all-Bartók concert by the Lindsay String Quartet. 1970 saw the foundation of the Arts Lab Sound Workshop by Jolyon Laycock, which produced a series of experimental sound performances throughout the 1970s involving improvisation, electronic music, amplification effects and liquid light shows, in regular collaboration with artists such as Cornelius Cardew, David Panton, Trevor Wishart and various ensembles associated with the University of Birmingham, often touring through Europe and North America. Notable premieres included Wishart's \"Menagerie\" and \"Audio Movies\".\n\nThe Arts Lab also developed a reputation as a centre of improvised rock, running from the psychedelia of Bachdenkel in the late 1960s, through the Arts Lab's own Amphioxus jazz-rock ensemble of the mid-seventies, to later collaborative performances at Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery.\n\nThe Arts Lab had a printing operation from its establishment in 1969, set up by Bryan Brown and Simon Chapman whose work was influenced by the psychedelic imagery of the West Coast of America. It initially used silkscreen printing to produce posters for Arts Lab events, and raising funds by producing posters for local Student Unions and music promotors. The posters operation was later taken over by Bob Linney and Ken Meharg for the Arts Lab – emphasising simultaneous colour contrasts and the dynamic integration of hand-painted text with manipulated photographic imagery – were especially notable, being the subject of an international touring exhibition by the British Council between 1981 and 1985, and an exhibition by Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery in 1998. Ernie Hudson was particularly renown for his revolutionary multiple colour silk screen prints produced during this time, notably posters for John Peel at Aston University, and various bands at the time. Although few remain, those that do are archived in Birmingham Museum and Art gallery. \n\nIn 1970 the Arts Lab obtained an offset litho press on loan from a local cash and carry operation (in return for printing the company's price list for free) and in 1972 bought a second hand press of its own. Initially intended to print flyers and price lists on a commercial basis, the take-over of the printing operation by Hunt Emerson in 1974 saw the Arts Lab move into comic art, producing a series of publications under its own Ar:Zak imprint. Starting with Emerson's own \"Large Cow Comix\" – which also featured work by Kevin O'Neill and Bryan Talbot – and eventually branching out such varied publications as Steve Bell's \"Big Foot\"; David Edgar's anti-Nazi \"Committed Comix\" and Suzy Varty's \"Heroine\" (the first British women's comic), Ar:Zak was to become an important part of the history of underground British comics, a position reinforced when the Arts Lab held \"KAK\" – the first \"Konvention of Alternative Komix\" in 1976.\n"}

While actual clinical phobias to color are rare, colors can elicit hormonal responses and psychological reactions.\n\nChromophobia may also refer to an aversion of use of color in products or design. Within cellular biology, \"chromophobic\" cells are a classification of cells that do not attract hematoxylin, and is related to chromatolysis.\n\nNames exist that mean fear of specific colors such as \"erythrophobia\" for the fear of red, \"xanthophobia\" for the fear of yellow and \"leukophobia\" for the fear of white. A fear of the color red may be associated with a fear of blood.\n\nIn his book \"Chromophobia \" published in 2000, David Batchelor says that in Western culture, color has often been treated as corrupting, foreign or superficial. Michael Taussig states that the cultural aversion to color can be traced back a thousand years, with Batchelor stating that it can be traced back to Aristotle's privileging of line over color.\n\nIn a study, hatchling Loggerhead sea turtles were found to have an aversion to lights in the yellow wave spectrum which is thought to be a characteristic that helps orient themselves toward the ocean. The Mediterranean sand smelt, \"Atherina hepsetus\", has shown an aversion to red objects placed next to a tank while it will investigate objects of other colors. In other experiments, geese have been conditioned to have adverse reactions to foods of a particular color, although the reaction was not observed in reaction to colored water.\n\nThe title character in Alfred Hitchcock's \"Marnie\" has an aversion to the color red caused by a trauma during her childhood which Hitchcock presents through expressionistic techniques, such as a wash of red coloring a close up of Marnie.\n\nThe term colorphobia can also be used refer to its literal etymological origin to refer to an apprehension towards image processing on one's vision and its visual perceptual property. However, the term's association with a racial component has been used by public figures such as Frederick Douglass.\n\nLeukophobia often takes the form of a fixation on pale skin. Those with the phobia may make implausible assumptions such as paleness necessarily representing ill health or a ghost. In other cases, leukophobia is directed more towards the symbolic meaning of whiteness, for instance in individuals who associate the color white with chastity and are opposed to or fear chastity. In Paul Beatty's novel \"Slumberland\", leukophobia refers to racism.\n\n"}

Theater dates back to the early 19th century when a theater was established in Samuel Blodgett Jr's Great Hotel on E Street in 1800, soon after the capital was relocated to Washington, D.C. The National Theatre opened in 1835 on E Street, near the White House. DAR Constitution Hall opened in 1929, and remained the city's primary concert hall until the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts opened in 1971.\n\nDAR Constitution Hall, National Theatre, and other venues remained segregated throughout the early part of the 20th century. Contralto Marian Anderson was barred from performing at Constitution Hall in 1939, instead performing at the Lincoln Memorial to large crowds. The U Street Corridor was the center of African American culture in Washington, D.C. The Lincoln Theatre hosted the likes of Duke Ellington and Ella Fitzgerald on U Street (known as \"Washington's Black Broadway\") prior to the 1968 riots.\n\nArena Stage, one of the first non-profit regional theaters in the nation produces an eight-show season ranging from classics to world premieres, dedicated to the American canon of theater.

Go-Go band and Washington natives Experience Unlimited (E.U.) hit the American pop charts in 1988 with their memorable dance tune \"Da Butt\" Other notable go-go bands include Rare Essence, Trouble Funk, Junkyard Band, Backyard Band, and the Northeast Groovers.\n\nWashington was an important center in the genesis of punk rock in the United States. Punk bands of note from Washington include Tru Fax & the Insaniacs, Fugazi, Bad Brains, and Minor Threat. Washingtonians continue to support punk bands, long after the punk movement's popularity peaked. The region also has a significant indie rock history and was home to TeenBeat, Dischord Records and Simple Machines, among other indie record labels.\n\nWashington is also home to Duke Ellington School of the Arts, founded in 1974 and part of the DC Public School System.

Most of these have been related to government (e.g., \"The West Wing\" and \"Commander in Chief\") or security organizations (\"The District\", \"Get Smart\"). Other programs had the nation's capital as a secondary focus, telling stories on their own that were not always tied to the infrastructure of the government either in the district or for the country. For instance, \"Murphy Brown\" focused on the lives of the reporters of the (fictional) Washington-based television newsmagazine, \"FYI\". The soap opera \"Capitol\" allowed for stories about political intrigue alongside the traditional class struggle sagas. The sitcom \"227\" portrayed the life of the African American majority as seen through the eyes of residents in a Washington apartment building. There are also many movies shot and filmed in the city yearly. \"Cory in the House\" on The Disney Channel uses Washington, D.C. as a backdrop.\n\nThe District has also been host to several movies, where the main characters are often linked to politics (\"Wedding Crashers\" and \"Being There\") or adventure (\"Hollow Man\" and \"National Treasure\").\n\nOther professional and semi-professional teams based in D.C. include the USAFL Baltimore Washington Eagles, the NWFA D.C. Divas, the Minor League Football D.C. Explosion, the Washington RFC rugby union team of the Rugby Super League, as well as a host of others playing in the Potomac Rugby Union and the Washington Cricket League. It was also home to the WUSA Washington Freedom, from 1987 to 1989 home of the Major Indoor Lacrosse League's Washington Wave, and during the 2000–2002 NLL seasons, the Washington Power was based in the city. In rugby league, the Washington, D.C. Slayers play in the American National Rugby League.\n\nThere were two Major League Baseball teams named the Washington Senators in the early and mid-20th century, which left to become respectively the Minnesota Twins and the Texas Rangers. In the 19th century, the town was home to teams called the Washington Nationals, Washington Statesmen, and Washington Senators on and off from the 1870s to the turn of the century.\n\nWashington was home to several Negro League baseball teams, including the Homestead Grays, Washington Black Senators, Washington Elite Giants, Washington Pilots, and Washington Potomacs.\n\nThe Capital One Arena in Chinatown, home to the Capitals, Mystics, Wizards and the Georgetown Hoyas, is also a major venue for concerts, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) professional wrestling, and other events, having replaced the old Capital Centre. Since its opening in 1997, the arena has served as a catalyst of prosperity in Chinatown. Office buildings, high-end condominiums, restaurant chains, movie theatres, and other luxuries have sprung up around Chinatown. On the downside, the growth has forced out many Chinatown landmarks, and only a fraction of Chinatown remains \"Chinese\".\n\nThe city's soccer team, D.C. United, is the most successful franchise in MLS history, with 4 league championships and 10 total tournament victories, both league highs. The city is also considered the most passionate soccer market, with a list of people including MLS Commissioner Don Garber and TV Commentator (and former US National team and MLS star) Eric Wynalda outright declaring Washington the country's best soccer market. Washington will host the 2007 edition of MLS Cup at RFK Stadium.\n\nWashington hosts the annual Legg Mason Tennis Classic tennis tournament that takes place at the Carter Barron Tennis Center on 17th Street.\n\nThe Marine Corps Marathon and the National Marathon are both held annually in Washington.\n\n\"The Washington Post\" is the oldest and most-read daily newspaper in Washington, and it has developed into one of the most reputable daily newspapers in the U.S. It is most notable for exposing the Watergate scandal, among other achievements. \"The Washington Post\" also has a daily free newspaper called the \"Express\", summarizing events, sports, and entertainment. The daily \"Washington Times\" and the free weekly \"Washington City Paper\" also have substantial readership in the District. On February 1, 2005 the free daily tabloid \"Washington Examiner\" debuted, having been formed from a chain of suburban newspapers known as the \"Journal Newspapers\".\n\nThe weekly \"Washington Blade\" and \"Metro Weekly\" focus on gay issues, and the \"Washington Informer\" on African American issues. Bi-weekly \"Street Sense\" focuses on issues of homelessness and poverty.\n\nMany neighborhoods in the District have their own community newspapers, usually published on a weekly basis. Some of these include The Current Newspapers, which has editions serving Dupont Circle, Foggy Bottom, Georgetown, Chevy Chase, Upper Northwest and a Capitol Hill paper called The Capitol Hill Current/Voice of the Hill. Additional papers include \"In-Towner\" (Dupont Circle, Logan Circle, and Adams Morgan), \"Hill Rag\" (Capitol Hill), \"East of the River\" (Anacostia), and \"DC North\" (Northeast DC). In addition, several specialty newspapers serve the U.S. Congress; most notable are \"Roll Call\" and \"The Hill\".\n\nThe metro area is served by several local broadcast television stations and is the eighth largest designated market area in the U.S., with 2,252,550 homes (2.04% of the U.S. population). Major television network affiliates include WRC 4 (NBC), WTTG 5 (Fox), WJLA 7 (ABC), WUSA 9 (CBS), WDCA 20 (MyNetwork TV) and WDCW 50 (The CW) as well as WETA 26 and WHUT 32 (PBS) stations. Channels 4 and 5 are Owned-and-operated stations. Public Access on Cable Television is provided by the Public Access Corporation of the District of Columbia on two channels simulcast to both local cable TV Systems. One channel is devoted to religious programming and the other channel provides a diversity of offerings. A regional news station, News Channel 8, is carried on Channel 8 on all cable systems in Washington, D.C. and surrounding communities. Additionally, most Baltimore area television stations can be seen in the Washington region. Besides being viewed clearly in the District, they can especially be seen in the suburbs of the Interstate 95 corridor between both cities. They are:\n\nWMAR 2 (ABC) – WBAL 11 (NBC) – WJZ 13 (CBS) – WMJF 16 (Ind/MTV2) – WMPT 22 / WMPB 67 (PBS/MPB) – WUTB 24 (MyNetwork TV) – WBFF 45 (FOX) – WNUV 54 (The CW) (The Tube on DT2)\n\nThe WTTG Television Tower, built in 1963, is a 214.8 metre high guyed TV mast; it is only 17.2 meters shorter than the Hughes Memorial Tower: the tallest structure in Washington, D.C. \n\nSpanish-language television is also represented by Telemundo WZDC-LP 25 and Telefutura affiliate WMDO-CA 47, but these are low-power television stations limited to within the Capital Beltway area. Univision's WFDC 14, however, transmits as a full power station and can be received as far north as Baltimore.\n\nIncidentally, D.C's Univision and Telefutura stations (owned by Entravision) switched call letters on January 1, 2006; meaning that now Univision is the only Spanish station which can be seen at full power over the whole Washington metropolitan area. The Univision network moved from low-powered Channel 47/WMDO to full-powered Channel 14/WFDC; Univision's youth-oriented Telefutura network moved from 14 to 47. The change caused Univision and Telefutura to exchange channel locations on D.C. area cable TV systems, too.\n\nAzteca America announced they would start transmitting from a new full powered Spanish-language broadcast affiliate in the region, Channel 69/WQAW on October 6, 2006, as well as its addition to local channel lineups for Comcast Cable. However it has not been seen on the air as of yet. Earliest reports from viewers do not indicate availability of its broadcasts inside the District, as far south as Prince William County, Virginia, or as far north as the Columbia/Baltimore area.\n\nSeveral cable television networks have their headquarters in the Washington area including C-SPAN on Capitol Hill, Black Entertainment Television (BET) in Northeast Washington, and Discovery Communications in Silver Spring, Maryland, as well as the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in Alexandria, Virginia. Major national broadcasters and cable outlets including NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX, and CNN maintain a significant presence in Washington, as do those from around the world including the BBC, CBC, and Al Jazeera. \"America's Most Wanted\" is the only network primetime program produced in Washington.\n\nThere are several major radio stations serving the metro area, with a wide variety of musical interests. Contemporary music Station (and arguably the most popular) is WIHT 99.5 FM (Hot 99.5) located in Rockville, Maryland.

It was founded by Cathy Hughes, a prominent figure in Washington radio since her days at Howard University's WHUR.\n\nThere are two National Public Radio (NPR) affiliates: WAMU 88.5 FM (NPR and Public Radio International programming, community programming, and BBC news), broadcast from the American University, and WETA 90.9 FM (around-the-clock classical music). Other stations include WASH 97.1 FM (adult contemporary), WMZQ-FM 98.7 FM (country music), WBIG 100.3 FM (classic hits), Triple X ESPN Radio 92.7 FM/94.3 FM/730 AM (sports talk station controlled by Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder), WLZL El Zol 99.1 FM (Latin/Tropical), WPRS-FM Praise 104.1 (gospel), WPFW 89.3 FM (jazz and progressive talk), WJZW 105.9 FM (smooth jazz), and WRQX 107.3 FM (hot adult contemporary). Additionally, most major radio stations from Baltimore can be heard in the Washington metropolitan area.\n\nXM Satellite Radio and NPR are based in Washington. The Voice of America, the U.S. government's international broadcasting service, is headquartered in Washington.\n\nThe Latino community in Washington, D.C. is one of the most thriving ones in the nation. The Mayor's Office has a division for the Latino community called OLA (the Office of Latino Affairs).\n\nThere are several medical centers that cater to the needs of the Spanish-speaking population. Also, there are about six newspapers in Spanish and various bilingual schools. Most government programs and facilities provide services in Spanish. The transportation system like Metro and buses offer information (e.g. brochures and announcements) in English and Spanish. There are many centers that offer services in Spanish and have special programs for the Latino community such as the Whitman-Walker Clinic, the Office of Human Services of the District of Columbia, most hospitals offer bilingual services including translators and bilingual staff on call twenty-four hours a day.\n\nLatin music is heard all across the city (supermarkets, Starbucks, restaurants, etc.) Bilingual staff can be found in most supermarkets, pharmacies, restaurants, laundromats, etc.\n\nSpanish is the second most spoken language in the city after English, and most government city programs publish and advertise in English and Spanish among other languages.

There is also a theater company called Gala, which presents plays all year round.\n\nThe metropolitan area of Washington, D.C. has the largest population of Salvadorans in the world after San Salvador. Also, there are communities from Peru, Guatemala, Honduras, Colombia, and other Latin American countries. Most universities and colleges in the area have Spanish and Latino representatives for the recruitment of Latino students. Furthermore, there are many organizations that foster the educational and professional needs of young Latino students, such as the Latin American Youth Center. There are also programs for Latinos who suffer from substance abuse, including AYUDA.\n\nThe Latino Federation of Greater Washington gathers the largest group of Latino organizations in the area and Latino serving populations programs in the region. Additionally, all Latin American countries have diplomatic representation in Washington, D.C., including Cuba. The World Bank, The InterAmerican Development Bank, The International Monetary Fund, and the Organization of American States have clubs, associations, and committees that gather Latinos from many countries and regions.\n\n"}
{"id": "2188986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188986", "title": "Emily Bishop", "text": "Emily Bishop\n\nEmily Bishop (also Nugent, Swain and known and credited in the early days of the show as Miss Nugent) is a fictional character from the British ITV soap opera, \"Coronation Street\". Portrayed by Eileen Derbyshire, the character is the longest-standing female character in the serial, having first appeared on-screen during an episode which aired on 27 January 1961. Derbyshire announced in November 2015 that she would be taking a sabbatical from the show and Emily departed on 1 January 2016 after 55 years on screen, but to date she has not returned.\n\nEmily first moved to Weatherfield in the late 1940s from Harrogate to work for Leonard Swindley (Arthur Lowe) at the Glad Tidings Mission Hall. A very quiet and Christian woman, she hardly knew anyone up on the street except Ena Sharples (Violet Carson) the caretaker of the Mission Hall and the owners of the Corner Shop, Elsie Lappin (Maudie Edwards) and then Florrie Lindley (Betty Alberge). She eventually meets the residents of the street following a gas leak in January 1961 which forced them to stay the night at the Mission Hall. After that she soon becomes friends with many of the residents and became a pillar of the community.\n\nSwindley soon ventures out becoming manager of the Rosamand Street branch of Gamma Garments, a clothing chain with Emily as his head assistant, their relationship becomes stronger and they decide to get married, however Swindley's pompousness and arrogance forces her to jilt him at the altar. A very moral woman, Emily prides herself on saving herself for marriage, but her resolve is eventually weakened and she begins a relationship with a Hungarian man called Miklos Zadic (Paul Stassino). She later confides in her friend Valerie Barlow (Anne Reid) that she has no regrets about the encounter; Emily is, by that time, 39 years old and assumes it will be now or never. With Miklos out of the picture, Emily falls in love with mild-mannered Ernest Bishop (Stephen Hancock) after meeting him at his mother's funeral. Their courtship is tested many times over and lasts for three years. They get engaged. The next year, Ernest is jailed in Majorca and subsequently freed, and it is at this time that they get married, broadcast across the UK on Easter Monday.\n\nDespite rough patches, Emily and Ernest's marriage is relatively stable and they love each other very much. Emily miscarries and later starts menopause, dashing their chances of having a child of their own. This leads to many arguments between them, and they are forced to re-evaluate their marriage after just two years. They turn to short-term fostering to assuage Emily's need to connect with young children. Tragedy strikes when Ernest is shot and killed in a botched robbery, leaving Emily devastated. Emily only starts to heal from heartbreak by playing with a baby, namely Deirdre Langton's (Anne Kirkbride) infant daughter Tracy (Christabel Finch). To occupy her time more interestingly, Emily leaves her post at the local hospital and becomes manageress of a café, with Gail Potter (Helen Worth) as her assistant. When the cafe is abruptly sold and new owner Jim Sedgwick (Michael O'Hagan) makes drastic changes to the food and service, Emily walks out and Gail takes over, although eventually Jim's wife Alma Sedgewick (Amanda Barrie) starts managing the cafe. In many respects, Emily has never let Ernest go but does marry again, to Arnold Swain (George Waring). He unfortunately turns out to be a bigamist. After she ends their relationship, he visits her and plans a murder-suicide. Emily tells him that God would not approve of what he is doing but Arnold insists she is wrong and goes upstairs to find a Bible. While he is gone, Emily runs outside for help. Arnold is sent to an institution where he dies ten months later. When factory boss Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs) needs a new wages clerk, he turns to Emily and she starts working in the same job held by her husband at the time of his death.\n\nEmily has a mental breakdown. She can't remember appointments, becomes confused and her appearance suffers. Lodger Percy Sugden (Bill Waddington), protects her, covering up these very unusual actions. He becomes increasingly concerned about her behaviour and alerts Emily's friends and neighbours. One day, Emily disappears without a word. When friends and neighbours ignore Percy's call for help, he calls the police who find Emily wandering aimlessly, clearly having suffered a breakdown. When Emily has recovered enough to leave hospital, she tells Percy that he is a good friend, and thanks him for all he had done. Percy later leaves. Emily falls in love once more, with Bernard, a vicar. He breaks off the engagement when he finds out she had suffered a mental breakdown. Due to his past, he cannot not face the possibility of it recurring. Since then, Emily has sworn off love completely, pushing herself into more topical endeavours instead. When her nephew Spider (Martin Hancock) arrives on the scene, Emily takes him in and they become fast friends as well as partners in saving the Red Rec from Alf Roberts' (Bryan Mosley) proposed plans for a \"Millennium Bowl\". Emily spends a night up in a tree standing by her convictions that the Red Rec is the last green space in Weatherfield and it deserves preservation.\n\nRichard Hillman (Brian Capron), Gail's husband, attempts to murder Emily for monetary reasons. He breaks in while she is watching television and babysitting for Ashley (Steven Arnold) and Maxine Peacock (Tracy Shaw). Richard knocks her unconscious with a crowbar but is interrupted by Maxine's early return. He attacks Maxine with the same weapon, killing her instantly. Emily makes a full recovery but suffers terrible guilt for surviving when Maxine didn't. She prevents a murder when grief-crazed Brenda Fearns (Julia Deakin) almost jumps off a forty-three foot church tower with baby Bethany Platt (Amy & Emily Walton).\n\nEmily befriends Ed Jackson (Chris Walker), a new member of the congregation at her church. He soon becomes a regular visitor to her house, doing odd jobs and they remain friends after he confesses that he has recently been released from prison. However, Emily is devastated when Ed admits why he has been in prison—he was the man who shot and killed Ernest. He tells her that, after finding God while in prison, he has come looking for her, attempting to atone for his misdemeanours. Enraged, Emily throws him out, and goes on to question her faith. Eventually, Emily forgives Ed as he contemplates suicide, and gives him Ernest's camera as a keepsake, asking him to send her a photo of him every year so that she can make sure he is alive and well.\n\nWhen Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) finds an envelope in Emily's drawer while looking to see what her PIN was when she has forgotten it. The envelope reads: \"to be opened after my death\". Norris tells Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) about it and she tells Emily about the situation so Emily agrees to tell Norris. She makes him promise not to tell anyone but it turns out that the envelope contains plans for her funeral. Norris discovers that this envelope isn't the one he has seen and tries hard to find out what really is in the envelope. It is revealed to be old photos of Rita from her singing days. Emily encounters Jed Stone (Kenneth Cope), a former resident of the street, when she is working at the canteen at Weatherfield General Hospital. Taking pity on him as he has no home to go to, Emily invites him to come and lodge with her and Norris. When Jed later goes missing, Emily is worried as he has left his cap behind. When Maria Connor (Samia Ghadie) returns from holiday she is surprised to learn that Jed has disappeared as they both had believed Tony Gordon (Gray O'Brien) was a killer. After Maria accuses Tony of killing Jed both Maria and Emily are relieved when Jed turns up \"unharmed\" but Jed is really hiding marks on his neck from when Tony had strangled him. Emily is later upset to hear that Jed has suffered a second heart attack after he receives a visit from Tony's henchman.\n\nNorris' half-brother Ramsay Clegg (Andrew Sachs) arrives after them not seeing each for many years. Emily tries to get Norris to forgive Ramsay before his return to Australia, and in doing so begins to fall for the man. She is very upset when he departs the Street, and is later shocked when he dies suddenly on his flight. She condemns Norris for treating Ramsay in the cold manner that he did. Emily later forgives Norris for his treatment of Ramsay. Emily took in Tracy (now played by Kate Ford) and Amy Barlow (Elle Mulvaney) as lodgers in her front parlour, after they were made homeless. However she kicks them out after Tracy deliberately ruins Ernest's pair of shoes believing them to be Norris'. Emily told Norris of her ambition to do charity work in Peru and to see her nephew, Spider again, she booked a flight and she departed the street.\n\nIn early 2018, Ken Barlow (William Roache) told Sophie Webster (Brooke Vincent) that Emily was back in the country, to look after a sick Freda. Ken told Sophie that they might see Emily back in Weatherfield soon. In April, Mary Taylor (Patti Clare) mentions to Jude and Angie Appleton (Paddy Wallace and Victoria Ekanoye) that Norris has visited Emily.\n\nIn December 1960, actress Eileen Derbyshire was approached by Granada to play a part in the show, but the actress was tied up in a Christmas stage play. Of this Derbyshire said: \"Four weeks after it started (airing) they said I could either wait until they introduced a new family into the programme or take the tiny part of a little, shy woman helper at the Mission Hall\" going on to say \"I have always been a fatalist, so I took the bird in one hand, not realising what a momentous decision I was making\".\n\nThe character of Emily was introduced when actress Eileen Derbyshire took on the role in Episode 15 on Friday, 27 January. At first, the character was simply called \"Miss Nugent\"; it wasn't until 1962 that she was given the name \"Emily\" by the show's writers. She continued to be credited on the programme as \"Miss Nugent\" until 1969.\n\nAlthough rarely seen, the set of Emily's kitchen is the oldest surviving set. (The second oldest set is Ken's kitchen, with the famous avocado-green tiles.) All other sets have been redecorated at least once since we first saw Emily's kitchen. Emily's back room/parlour, however, was redecorated off screen. In the story a fire was caused by a candle left unattended by Spider and Toyah when they made their way upstairs after a romantic evening. Spider was able to track down matching wallpaper to cover up the fire damage so that Emily would not know what had happened, but in reality, the wallpaper was no longer obtainable, so the whole set was re-decorated in a very similar style. Emily has lived at No. 3 Coronation Street since 1972. It is mentioned that Emily is from Harrogate.\n\nIn January 2009, a \"Coronation Street\" spokesperson denied claims that the character of Emily, along with other established actresses Barbara Knox and Betty Driver (who portray characters Rita Sullivan and Betty Williams respectively) were axed by producer Kim Crowther in a bid to save money on salaries.\n\nDuring an interview in 1991, Derbyshire spoke about her character's thirty years in the show, stating: \"The writers have a tough enough task as it is, trying to find new storylines for a character who has been in the serial for three decades.\" Going on to say \"I just get on with it. Emily has had a more colourful past than you might think. She has had lots of men friends and liaisons. In the early days, when they were stuck for something to do with her, I think the writers used to say 'Let's give Emily another boyfriend.' I've lost count of the number of men friends she has had\".\n\nOver the years, the character has proved her good neighbour image by taking in a number of lodgers, most notably Percy Sugden, Curly Watts, her nephew Spider, Rita Tanner and current lodger Norris Cole.\n\nIn November 2015, \"Coronation Street\" confirmed that Derbyshire had requested a six-month break with immediate effect, which she was granted. Derbyshire was one of four cast members to announce their temporary exit around the same time as Alison King who plays Carla Connor, David Neilson who plays Roy Cropper and Les Dennis who plays Michael Rodwell also announced that they would be temporarily departing. Derbyshire's exit scenes aired on 1 January 2016 in which Emily left the street to visit her nephew Spider (Martin Hancock).\n\nDerbyshire later extended her leave until the end of 2016. In November 2016, it was reported that Derbyshire would not be reprising the role. A source told \"The Sun\" that there was \"no expectation that she will be back\". They went on to say: \"All of her cast mates have accepted she won't be returning. She's 85 and has been out of the show for a year, so she probably would have found it tough to get back into the fast pace of filming.\" However, a spokesperson later said the door is still open for her when she is ready, saying: \"Eileen is taking an extended break, and has given no indication that she doesn't plan to return.\"\n\nDuring an episode broadcast on 3 January 2018, Ken Barlow remarked to Sophie Webster that Emily had returned to the UK to look after her niece Freda, who had fallen ill. This led to speculation that the character would soon be returning to the show.\n\nIn 2001, a storyline involving Emily lending her nephew Spider £15,000 for a new business venture was criticised for not being authentic. Journalist Tony Bridgland writing for the \"Telegraph\" said of the plot; \"It is beginning to look as though \"Coronation Street\"'s researchers failed to do enough homework to make their plot watertight.\" \"The Guardian\" compiled a list of ten favourite Christmas moments from soap; on the list was the 2002 Christmas episode where Richard Hillman came close to suffocating Emily with a pillow as she slept.\n\nDiscussing the scene where Emily was attacked by Richard Hillman in 2003, critic Chris Diamond wryly commented: \"Surely Emily wouldn't be in the line of fire? Poor, drippy, sensible shoes Emily? But she was and the scene where Richard laid the blow on her was one of the most genuinely shocking things I have ever seen on television. I just couldn't believe my eyes. And that was where the genius of the episode lay. I knew Emily was going to get it. I saw Richard creeping up behind her and I was fully cognoscent of the fact that the crowbar in his hand was not for snagging her cardie. But I was sure that even at this point something was going to happen that would divert Richard from his target. When the blow actually fell I was utterly amazed.\"\n\nDek Hogan writing for media website \"Digital Spy\" in 2005 praised Eileen Derbyshire's comedic abilities; \"the book club storyline doesn't exactly fill me with joy but does have the advantage of giving some fine comedic material to the underused talents of Eileen Derbyshire. As Emily Bishop she has shown a major flair for these scenes in the past.\" In 2006, writer Eve-Marie Wilson in an article criticised the plot which saw Emily forgiving her husband's killer: \"...on \"Coronation Street\" recently, Emily Bishop was having a crisis of conscience, could she or couldn’t she forgive Ed, the man who had killed her husband all those years ago. After two or three episodes the matter was resolved. Had that incident occurred on a soap opera she’d still be undecided six months later!\"\n\nIn 2009 Ruth Deller of entertainment website Lowculture commented that Emily is underused in storylines, but praised her stating: \"Emily is one of those characters who seems to have always been around but rarely gets singled out for attention, yet she can be both funny and heartbreaking. She's really stood out in her scenes this month and has been the only good thing about the Norris/Ramsay storyline of infinite tedium.\" In the book \"Women and soap opera: a study of prime time soaps\", Christine Geraghty describes Emily as being \"shy, frightened of speaking out until roused, a spinster type whose complex marital history is seldom referred to\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2638362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2638362", "title": "Emma (1996 theatrical film)", "text": "Emma (1996 theatrical film)\n\nEmma is a 1996 period film based on the 1815 novel of the same name by Jane Austen. Written and directed by Douglas McGrath, the film stars Gwyneth Paltrow, Alan Cumming, Toni Collette, Ewan McGregor, and Jeremy Northam.\n\nThe film describes a year in the life of Emma Woodhouse, a congenial but naïve young woman who thinks of herself as a romantic matchmaker in her small community in early-19th-century England. When her governess, Miss Taylor, gets married and goes to live with her new husband, Mr Weston, Emma proudly takes the credit for having brought the couple together. Her father and their old family friend (and brother of Emma's sister's husband) George Knightley dispute her claim and disapprove of her trying to make more matches, but she ignores their warnings and sets her mind on setting up Mr Elton, the minister who performed the Westons' marriage ceremony, with Harriet Smith, an unsophisticated young woman on the verges of society.\n\nAs a close friendship develops between Emma and Harriet, it becomes clear that Harriet is being courted by Robert Martin, a farmer who has known Harriet since she was a girl. When Mr Martin proposes to Harriet, she is inclined to accept, but she has come to rely heavily on Emma's advice, and Emma persuades her to reject the proposal. Meanwhile, Mr Elton has been expressing a desire for Emma by taking an interest in a picture she drew of Harriet and by giving her a riddle for a book of riddles being compiled by Harriet. Emma misinterprets this as interest in Harriet, but when Mr Elton and Emma are alone, he fervently declares his love for Emma herself, and she finally realizes her mistake. She harshly rejects his pleas, and he later marries another woman, who turns out to be a vain socialite who competes with Emma for status in the community.\n\nOver the next few months, various gatherings show who loves whom among Emma's friends. Emma is briefly attracted to a charming, gallant young man named Frank Churchill, Mr Weston's son who comes to visit from London, but Emma soon decides to set him up with Harriet. However, Frank is revealed to have a secret engagement with a shy, pretty woman named Jane Fairfax. Harriet states that she has no interest in Frank, preferring Mr Knightley, who was the only man who would dance with her at a party. Mr Knightley only danced with Harriet out of politeness and has started to fall in love with Emma.\n\nThe conclusion of the story begins when Emma ridicules a poor woman named Miss Bates during a picnic, after which Mr Knightley angrily scolds Emma and leaves town for a while. She finds herself thinking about him while he's away, but does not realize she loves him until Harriet expresses interest in him. When Mr Knightley returns, he and Emma cross paths in a meadow and have a conversation that begins awkwardly but ends with him asking her to marry him and her gladly accepting. The news of their engagement upsets Harriet, who avoids Emma for a while, but returns a few weeks later, engaged to Mr Martin. The film ends with Emma and Mr Knightley's wedding.\n\nDouglas McGrath \"fell in love\" with Jane Austen's 1815 novel \"Emma\", while he was an undergraduate at Princeton University. He believed the book would make a great film, but it was not until a decade later that he was given a chance to work on the idea. After receiving an Academy Award nomination in 1995 for his work on \"Bullets Over Broadway\", McGrath decided to make the most of the moment and took his script idea for a film adaptation of \"Emma\" to Miramax Films. McGrath had initially wanted to write a modern version of the novel, set on the Upper East Side of New York City. Miramax's co-chairman, Harvey Weinstein, liked the idea of a contemporary take on the novel. McGrath was unaware that Amy Heckerling's \"Clueless\" was already in production until plans for \"Emma\" were well underway.\n\nMcGrath decided to bring in American actress Gwyneth Paltrow to audition for Emma Woodhouse, after a suggestion from his agent and after seeing her performance in \"Flesh and Bone\". Of his decision to bring Paltrow in for the part, McGrath revealed \"The thing that actually sold me on her playing a young English girl was that she did a perfect Texas accent. I know that wouldn't recommend her to most people. I grew up in Texas, and I have never heard an actor or actress not from Texas sound remotely like a real Texan. I knew she had theater training, so she could carry herself. We had many actresses, big and small, who wanted to play this part. The minute she started the read-through, the very first line, I thought, 'Everything is going to be fine; she's going to be brilliant.'\" Following the read through, the co-chairman of Miramax, Harvey Weinstein, decided to give \"Emma\" the green-light. However, he wanted Paltrow to appear in \"The Pallbearer\" first, before going ahead and allowing the film to be made. While she recovered from wisdom-tooth surgery, Paltrow had a month to herself do her own research for the part. She also studied horsemanship, dancing, singing, archery and the \"highly stylized\" manners and dialect during a three-week rehearsal period. \n\nJeremy Northam revealed that when he first tried to read \"Emma\", he did not get very far and was not a fan. When he read the script for the film, he was initially considered for another role, but he wanted to play George Knightley. He stated \"When I met the director, we got on very well and we talked about everything except the film. At the end of it, he said he thought Knightley was the part for me, so I didn't have to bring up the issue at all.\" Northam added that Knightley's faith in Emma becoming a better person was one of the reasons he loved the character. Australian actress Toni Collette was cast as Harriet Smith. Collette also struggled to get into the Austen books when she was younger, but after reading \"Emma\", which she deemed \"warm and witty and clever\", she began to appreciate them more. Collette had to gain weight to portray \"the Rubenesque Harriet\" and she explained \"I think it's important for people to look real in films. There's a tendency to go Barbie doll and I don't agree with that at all.\"\n\nEwan McGregor was cast as Frank Churchill. He told Adam Higginbotham from \"The Guardian\" that he chose to star in \"Emma\" because he thought it would be something different from his previous role in \"Trainspotting\". McGregor later regretted appearing in the film, saying \"My decision-making was wrong. It's the only time I've done that. And I learnt from it, you know. So I'm glad of that – because it was early on and I learnt my lesson. It's a good film, \"Emma\", but I'm just... not very good in it. I'm not helped because I'm also wearing the world's worst wig. It's quite a laugh, checking that wig out.\" Real-life mother and daughter, Phyllida Law and Sophie Thompson, portrayed Mrs and Miss Bates. Thompson revealed that it was a coincidence that she and her mother were cast alongside each other, as the casting director had their names on separate lists. McGrath initially believed Thompson to be too young to play Miss Bates, but he changed his mind after seeing her wearing glasses with her hair down.\n\nAlan Cumming appeared as Reverend Philip Elton, who falls in love with Emma. Cumming wrote on his official website that the friendship that developed between himself and McGrath was one of the most memorable things about his time working on the film. He went on to state that the worst thing about the shoot was his hair, which had been lightened and curled for the character. Juliet Stevenson portrayed the \"ghastly\" Mrs Elton, while Polly Walker and Greta Scacchi starred as Jane Fairfax and Anne Taylor respectively. Other cast members included Edward Woodall as Robert Martin, James Cosmo as Mr Weston and Denys Hawthorne as Mr Woodhouse, in one of his last film appearances.\n\nBritish costume designer Ruth Myers created and designed the clothing for the film. She wanted to mirror the lightness of the script within the costumes and give \"a spark of color and life\" to the early 19th century setting. During her research, Myers noted a similarity between the fashions after the Napoleonic Wars and the 1920s, saying that they had \"the same sort of flapperish quality\". The designer explained \"The moment I set to research it, more and more it kept striking me what the similarities were between the two periods. It was a period of freedom of costume for women, and it was a period of constant diversions for the upper classes–picnics, dinners, balls, dances. What I wanted to do was make it look like the watercolors of the period, which are very bright and very clear, with very specific colors.\"\n\nMyers went on to reveal that she did not want the costumes to have a \"heavy English look\" and instead she wanted \"to get the freedom of bodies that you see in all the drawings, the form of the body underneath, the swell of the breasts.\" Myers told Barbara De Witt from the \"Los Angeles Daily News\" that using pastel-colored clothing to get the watercolor effect was one of her major challenges during the production. The designer was later criticised for being inaccurate, but she stated that she did not want the costumes to look old or sepia. Myers only had five weeks in which to create 150 costumes for the production, and she was constantly working on the set.\n\nEmma's wedding dress was made from silk crepe and embroidered with a small sprig pattern, while the sleeves and the train were made from embroidered net. Of the dress, Myers stated \"The inspiration for Emma's wedding dress began with a small amount of exquisite vintage lace that became the overlay. I wanted a look that would work not only for the period but also one that would compliment Gwyneth Paltrow's youth, swan neck, and incredible beauty. I was also hoping to evoke happiness and the English countryside; the sun did shine on the day we shot the scene!\"\n\nThe musical score of the film was written by British composer Rachel Portman. It was released on July 29, 1996. Portman told Rebecca Jones from the BBC that her score was \"purely classical\". She continued \"It is an orchestral piece, by which I mean that there is nothing in it that you wouldn't find in a symphony orchestra. It was influenced by my roots and my classical background.\" Portman used various instruments to give a voice to the characters. She revealed that \"a quivering violin\" would represent Harriet's uneasy stomach, while \"a bittersweet clarinet\" would accompany Emma though her emotional journey. Josh Friedman from the \"Los Angeles Times\" believed Portman's \"crafty score guides the audience through the heroine's game playing, and ultimately, to her romantic destiny.\" He also thought the music had \"a sneaky, circular feel\".\n\n\"Playbill's\" Ken LaFave commented that the score \"underlined the period romanticism\" in \"Emma\" and contained a \"string-rich, romantic sound\". Jason Ankeny, a music critic for \"Allmusic\", wrote that Portman's score to \"Emma\" employed all of her \"signatures\" like \"whimsical yet romantic melodies, fluffy string arrangements, and woodwind solos\", which would be familiar to anyone who had listened to her previous film scores. He stated, \"it seems as if she's simply going through the motions, content to operate within the confines of an aesthetic that, admittedly, is hers and hers alone. By no means a bad score, \"Emma\" is nevertheless a disappointment – if you've heard a previous Rachel Portman score, you've pretty much heard this one as well.\" On March 24, 1997, Portman became the first woman to win the Academy Award for Best Original Score. The album contains 18 tracks; the first track is \"Main Titles\", and the final track is \"End Titles\".\n\nAlthough in general staying close to the plot of the book, the screenplay by Douglas McGrath enlivens the banter between the staid Mr Knightley and the vivacious Emma, making the basis of their attraction more apparent.\n\nAusten's original novel deals with Emma's false sense of class superiority, for which she is eventually chastised. In an essay from \"Jane Austen in Hollywood\", Nora Nachumi writes that, due partly to Paltrow's star status, Emma appears less humbled by the end of this film than she does in the novel.\n\nThe film has received generally positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 84% based on reviews from 50 critics, with a rating average of 7.1 out of 10. The consensus writes: \"\"Emma\" marks an auspicious debut for writer-director Douglas McGrath, making the most of its Jane Austen source material – and a charming performance from Gwyneth Paltrow.\" Metacritic gives the film a rating of 66 out of 100 based on reviews from 22 critics.\n\nKen Eisner, writing for \"Variety\", proclaimed \"Gwyneth Paltrow shines brightly as Jane Austen's most endearing character, the disastrously self-assured matchmaker Emma Woodhouse. A fine cast, speedy pacing and playful direction make this a solid contender for the Austen sweepstakes.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "55521935", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55521935", "title": "Es spricht der Unweisen Mund wohl", "text": "Es spricht der Unweisen Mund wohl\n\n\" (\"The mouth of fools doth God confess\") is a Lutheran hymn of 1524, with words written by Martin Luther in 1523, paraphrasing Psalm 14. It was published as one of eight songs in 1524 in the first Lutheran hymnal, the Achtliederbuch. It was also published later that year in the Erfurt \"Enchiridion\". It has appeared in many hymnals, both in German and in translation. The text inspired vocal and organ music by composers such as Johann Pachelbel.\n\nAt the end of 1523, Luther paraphrased Psalm 14 (Psalm 13 in Vulgata numbering), in Latin , attempting to make the psalms accessible to Protestant church services in German. As he did with \"\", Luther expanded the content of the psalm to show the precise situation of the early Reformation as a time of conflict. Luther wrote six stanzas of seven lines each.\n\nThe hymn was one of the eight hymns in the first Lutheran hymnal, published 1524 in Nuremberg under the title (Some Christian songs), also called Achtliederbuch, which contained four songs by Luther, three by Speratus, and one by Justus Jonas. Later that same year it appeared in Erfurt in \"Eyn Enchiridion\", and in Wittenberg in Johann Walter's choral hymnal in a five-part setting.\n\nIn the Achtliederbuch, the hymn was indicated to be sung to the same melody as \"\" by Paul Speratus. In the Walter hymnal, it appeared with a different melody.\n\nThe hymn was set by composers for instruments and for voices. Johann Pachelbel composed three chorale preludes for organ as part of before 1693. Johann Sebastian Bach set the hymn in a four-part setting, BWV 308, but without text. The text was added in the Neue Bach-Ausgabe.\n\nThe hymn was translated to English as \"The mouth of fools doth God confess\" and appeared in R. Massie's \"M. Luther's Spiritual Songs\" in 1854. It was copied to other hymnals. Other, less common translations were published in the 19th century.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4444054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4444054", "title": "Essay mill", "text": "Essay mill\n\nAn essay mill (also term paper mill) is a business that allows customers to commission an original piece of writing on a particular topic so that they may commit academic fraud. Customers provide the company with specific information about the essay, including: a page length, a general topic, and a time frame with which to work. The customer is then charged a certain amount per page. The similar essay bank concept is a company from which students can purchase pre-written but less expensive essays on various topics, at higher risk of being caught. Both forms of business are under varying legal restraints in some jurisdictions.\n\nThe idea behind term paper mills can be dated back to the mid-nineteenth century in which \"paper reservoirs\" were located in the basements of fraternity houses. Otherwise known as \"fraternity files,\" these essay banks were practices in which students shared term papers and submitted work that had been done by other students. These essay banks inspired the commercialization of ghostwritten essay-writing practices. As early as the 1950s, advertisements were circulating college campus that described services that included ghostwritten work for dissertations, theses, and term papers.\n\nIn conjunction with this practice, the changing attitudes of students in the 1960s and 1970s started to stray away from diligent and engaged course work because they saw an emphasis on the benefits of community involvement. A new focus on activities outside of the classroom took away from time to focus on class work, thus promoting these writing services throughout college campuses.\n\nSoon, actual businesses were providing custom-written essays for students in exchange for compensation. They were located near college campuses. One could walk into a building and peruse pricing pamphlets, speak to someone directly to place an order, or possibly make a selection from a vault of recycled research papers stored in the basement of these businesses.\n\n\"Essay mill\" companies hire university students, graduates, and professional writers to ghostwrite essays and term papers, and solicit business from university and college students by posting advertisements. Until the early 1990s, most essay mill companies were 'bricks and mortar' businesses offering their services by mail-order or from offices located in university or college towns. By the 2000s, most essay mill businesses have switched to an e-commerce business model, soliciting business and selling essays using an Internet website. Companies often provide free sample essays on popular topics to attract Internet searches.\n\nTo obtain an essay, a customer usually submits a form that describes the assignment that he or she wants completed, how many pages it needs to be, and when it needs to be completed by. On the opposite end of the transaction, the employee searches through requests until he or she finds something that sparks their interest. A writer will take anything that they know they can write something that will be quick and hit the page requirement. It does not matter if the writer has previous knowledge about the subject; if it is easy to research, he or she will get the job done.\n\nDepending on how much a student pays an essay mill, a student can receive a number of different products. The most expensive of these products would be a full-written essay (or even a dissertation) that a student can turn in. Requested papers can follow specific guidelines laid out by the student including the use of a certain amount of sources, a preselected topic, and the receiving of specific grade by the student. Some students may request to receive a high mark on a purchased essay in order to boost their Grade Point Average (GPA), while some may deliberately order an essay that will give them a \"C\" in order to reduce suspicion of academic fraud. One of the cheaper options an essay mill might offer is just a detailed outline of information a student should include in an essay that a student will write themselves. Due to the nature of this type of transaction, purchasing an outline is very hard for schools to catch as a form of an academic dishonesty.\n\nSimilar to essay mills, an essay bank is a company where students can go to purchase pre-written essays. Due to the nature of essay bank essays, students may find themselves more likely to be caught for committing academic dishonesty. As a result of this, essay bank essays in general may cost less than those from essay mills.\n\nAlthough essay mills and the students who use them are considered unethical by many educational professionals, they do not violate copyright law; the mill is the legal copyright holder of the papers, and the papers are licensed to paying students for limited use. The mill may, however, hold the student legally responsible in the case where they redistribute the paper to other students without the permission of the mill. In informal settings where students exchange papers without any formal licensing or transfer of copyright, copyright violation may occur, but it is unlikely that the students will press charges, since they would incriminate themselves by doing so.\n\nIn some countries, essay mills are legally allowed to operate because of the way in which they describe their services. Essay mills state that the papers that they produce are not intended to be submitted for credit, but rather to be used by the customer to generate ideas to his or her own paper. When asked if their services are considered cheating, one online company states that, \"No, it’s not. Dealing with us is pretty much like going to the library, where we would be acting as a helpful librarian helping you get enough material for a good grade. We are only offering you to make use of our take on your assignment and the results of our research on your paper's topic.\" The company is not responsible if the customer submits the essay verbatim for credit because that goes against the company’s terms of use.\n\nWhile there is no federal law against the operation of essay mills, there are over a dozen individual states in the US that have their own laws against them. The first major legal battle against an essay mill came in 1972 in the case of \"State of New York v. \". This case involved the state challenging an essay mill's business with reference to the New York Education Law. The law \"condemns the obtaining of a degree by fraudulent means or 'aiding and abetting' another to do the same.\" The state claimed that the students were using the term papers they purchased for credit and even though the company stated that the essays they wrote were for research purposes only, their advertising scheme encouraged otherwise by boasting about grades. The court determined that the disclaimers did not sufficiently protect the company because their encouragement of cheating and plagiarism hurt the educational system. The ruling called for the company to cease business in the State of New York. Several other legal battles have been fought since and have largely resulted in the punishment of the term paper writers rather than the students purchasing them.\n\nCalifornia Education Code Section 66400 \"penalizes the preparation or sale of term papers, thesis, or dissertations for compensation ...\" The law is applicable when the preparer/seller knew or should have known that the recipient would submit the paper for academic credit. State residents or academic institutions \"acting for the interest of itself, its students, or the general public\" can file suit against offenders for \"any relief as is necessary.\" This law differs from that of New York in various ways, including holding the vendor responsible even if it claims that the paper was not intended to be turned in for credit, if the court concludes that it should have known that it would, or if the claim is not credible. For example, while some essay mills state that their products are not intended to be submitted for credit, they may also boast of the high grades that their papers have received.\n\nThe 2011 Florida Statutes Section 877.17 states that it is a second degree misdemeanor to \"sell, offer to sell, or advertise for sale\" a \"written, recorded, pictorial, artistic, or other assignment\" to another for submission \"unaltered to a substantial degree.\" In the state of Florida, second degree misdemeanors are punishable by up to sixty days in prison.\n\nThe academic community has criticized essay mill companies for helping students to commit academic fraud.\n\nSome essay mills have defended themselves against criticism by claiming that they are selling pre-written examples which students can use as guidelines and models for the student's own work. In 2002, a UK-based essay mill called Elizabeth Hall Associates required students purchasing essays to sign a disclaimer stating that \"any material provided by Elizabeth Hall Associates [is] on the understanding that it is a guidance model only.\" Other essay mills claim that they are \"scholarly publishing houses\" that provide students with essays that the student can then cite in the student's own work.\n\nStudents from different academic backgrounds have used essay mills. Many prestigious universities and colleges have caught their students turning in papers they bought from essay mills. The University of California, San Diego caught 600 students cheating in one year. One of the forms of cheating was turning in papers bought from essay mills.\n\nUsing term paper mills brings up some ethical controversies. Some people view essay mills as unethical while others view it as completely moral. People view essay mills as ethical for different reasons. Some customers indicate that they use essay mills as a form of proof reading. Essay mill writers will read their writing only to make comments and feedback about content and grammar mistakes. They also turn to essay mills to insure that all citations are correct. Some customers claim that they turn to essay mills because society has put too much pressure on students to achieve academic success. GPAs and grades are greatly stressed in schools which causes students to worry and make them feel like they cannot meet their deadlines. In order to get the paper handed in on time, students seek out term paper mills. Essay mills have been compared to business situations. Certain students and customers view term paper mills as equivalent to companies outsourcing labor. Outsourcing labor is a norm for businesses which insinuates that the use of term paper mills should be socially acceptable.\n\nConversely, there are people who view purchasing essays from essay mills as unethical: it is a form of cheating and plagiarism because one person is taking credit of another individual’s work. Academic institutions are concerned about how essay mills affect learning. Students who use essay mills do not go through the process of gathering research, which is a learning experience in itself. Some professors, such as Dan Ariely, a professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University and the author of \"The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty\", worry about the message term paper mills send to students. He believes the existence of essay mills validates slacking off. Ariely has come across essay mills use plagiarism-encouraging language on their websites.\n\nStudents generally know that using essay mill services is not right; according to a study conducted Patrick Scanlon and David Neumann, 90% of students surveyed admitted that the practice is unethical. However, the same study showed that students believe around 20% of their peers frequently use these online services.\n\nMany customers believe that when they are ordering an essay online, that they are going to be receiving one from their own country; however, this is not always the case, as many essay mill companies are hosted around the world. Not only are many of the essay mill companies hosted overseas, but many of the writers for these companies do not have graduate degrees, and have learned English as their second language.\n\nHaving essay mills set up overseas allows for the owners of these companies to make high profits by paying wages in low-wage countries while selling the work of their employees in high-wage countries. A 2009 article in The Chronicle of Higher Education stated that overseas writers only get paid between $1 and $3 per page out of the $20 to $30 US-customers pay per page. Compared to American writers that work for essay mills, this is a very low rate. Another article in \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\" from 2010 interviewed an American essay mill writer, who stated that he makes half of what the paper sells for.\n\nEven in the US, the amount that writers get paid can vary. Some American writers are only able to bring in around $1,000 per month in their highest paying months which can make some writers have to take up a second job. Other American writers are more successful when working for essay mills. Some of the better writers are able to make up to $5,000 per month.\n\nUniversities and colleges have developed several strategies to combat this type of academic misconduct. Some professors require students to submit electronic versions of their term papers, so that the text of the essay can be compared by anti-plagiarism software (such as Turnitin) against databases of known \"essay mill\" term papers.\n\nOther universities have enacted rules allowing professors to give students oral examinations on papers which a professor believes to be ghostwritten; if the student is unfamiliar with the content of an essay that he has submitted, or its sources, then the student can be charged with academic fraud, a violation of the rules by which a student agrees to be bound when he enters a university or college program.\n\nWhen a student is charged with academic fraud, his case is typically heard by a quasi-judicial administrative committee, which reviews the evidence. For students who are found guilty, the punishments range from a grade of zero on the specific assignment, to failure in the course in which the plagiarism occurred, to (in extreme or repeated cases) suspension or expulsion from the institution. In some cases, students who have committed academic fraud may also have academic honors, degrees, or awards revoked.\n\n\n"}

The different pitches are achieved using a bronze or wooden mouthpiece attached to the apex of the shell's spire. At freezing temperatures (often encountered in the mountainous regions of Japan) the lips may freeze to the metal surface, so wooden or bamboo mouthpieces are used.\n\nThe conch is used by Buddhist monks for religious purposes. Its use goes back at least 1,000 years, and it is still used today for some rituals, such as the \"omizutori\" (water drawing) portion of the Shuni-e rites at the Tōdai-ji in Nara. Each Shugendō school has his own conch shell melodies.\n\nThe \"hora\" is especially associated with the \"Yamabushi\", ascetic warrior monks of the Shugendō tradition. The \"yamabushi\" used the trumpet to signal their presence (or movements) to one another across mountains and to accompany the chanting of sutras.\n\nIn war, the shell, called \"jinkai\", or \"war shell\", was one of several used by Japanese feudal warriors known as samurai. A large conch would be used and fitted with a bronze (or wooden) mouthpiece. It would be held in an openwork basket and blown with a different combination of \"notes\" to signal troops to attack, withdraw, or change strategies, in the same way a bugle or flugelhorn was used in the west. The trumpeter was called a \"kai yaku\" (貝役).\n\nThe \"jinkai\" served a similar function to drums and bells in signaling troop formations, setting a rhythm for marching, providing something of a heroic accompaniment to encourage the troops and confusing the enemy by inferring that the troop numbers were large enough to require such trumpeters. Many \"daimyōs\" (feudal lords) enlisted \"yamabushi\" to serve as \"kai yaku\", due to their experience with the instrument.\n\nThe sound of \"jinkai\" is often used in motion pictures and television dramas as a symbolic sound effect indicating an impending battle, e.g., \"The Last Samurai\" or the 2007 Taiga drama \"Fūrinkazan\", but both of these screen renditions use deep, resonating monotones, not the melodic tones that \"yamabushi\" used for relaying messages.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10455319", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10455319", "title": "Joyce Theater", "text": "Joyce Theater\n\nThe Joyce Theater (The Joyce\") is a 472-seat dance performance venue located in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City. The building opened in 1941 as the Elgin Theater, a movie house, and was gut-renovated and reconfigured in 1981-82 to reopen as the Joyce Theater. The Joyce is a leading presenter of dance in New York City and nationally.\n\nIn 1977, the Eliot Feld Ballet had begun exploring more affordable approaches to presenting its annual season of performances in New York City. Rental costs and house sizes of the theaters available to the company made these seasons financially risky propositions. Eliot Feld, the company’s founder and Artistic Director, and Cora Cahan, its Executive Director, envisioned creating a theater specifically for smaller dance organizations that their company could use, which would also be available to other companies. \n\nThe first facility they looked at in late 1978 was the Elgin Theater, a defunct movie theater in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood built in 1941. They quickly commenced negotiations to purchase it, ultimately arriving at a price of $225,000 and concluded the transaction in January, 1979. The philanthropist LuEsther Mertz, co-founder of Publishers Clearing House and a benefactor of the company who had supported the renovation of the company’s studio, underwrote the full cost of the purchase.\n\nIn developing financial projections for the theater, Feld and Cahan anticipated an inclusive rental cost of around $12,000 per week. In a national survey they conducted, 73 dance organizations expressed interest in using the theater at the projected rental rate. These findings helped garner a wide range of financial support for developing the theater. The project secured a $400,000 Federal Urban Development Action Grant, which recognized its potential to provide employment and add to the vitality of its neighborhood. Other Federal Government support included a $450,000 challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, and a guarantee of a $600,000 bank loan. Private donors and foundations such as the Rockefeller Foundation contributed the balance of the funds.\n\nFeld and Cahan engaged architect Hugh Hardy of the firm Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer to develop plans for a gut renovation of the facility. Major changes to the structure included the elimination of the original balcony configuration to create a steeply raked seating area on one level, new construction at the rear of the building to provide additional backstage space, and the installation of a 67 x 36 foot proscenium stage with a sprung floor. The completed theater had 472 seats. The overall cost of the project was $3.6 million. At the June 25, 1981 groundbreaking, the building was renamed the Joyce Theater after the daughter of LuEsther Mertz in recognition of the elder Mertz’s leadership support of the project. The theater opened with a gala performance on June 2, 1982.\n\nThe Feld organization retained ownership of the building and created a separate non-profit organization to operate the theater under a 35-year lease at a nominal rent of $1 a year. As the 2016 conclusion of the lease term approached, the operating organization, the Joyce Theater Foundation, purchased the theater from the Feld organization for $20 million.\n\nThe Joyce is a 501(c)3 charitable organization whose mission is “To serve and support the art of dance and choreography, to promote the richness and variety of the art form in its fullest expression, and to advance the public interest in, and appreciation of, dance and the allied arts of music, design, and theater.”\n\nA 27-member Board of Trustees oversees the organization. It operates on a budget of around $10 million annually that is supported by earned revenue, contributed income, government support and endowment income. Executive Director Linda Shelton oversees day-to-day activities of the Joyce, supported by a full-time staff of approximately 45 people. Before joining the Joyce in 1993, Shelton was General Manager of the Joffrey Ballet, and had earlier held senior management roles at Twyla Tharp Dance. Aaron Mattocks is Director of Programming, with lead responsibility for developing each year’s presenting season.\n\nThe Joyce presents an annual 40 to 45 week season on its stage, hosting an audience of approximately 150,000 people. In addition to this Chelsea season, the Joyce presents or co-presents at a small number of other venues, including the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center and alternative spaces.\n\nThrough artistic residency and commissioning programs, the Joyce gives resources to established, early- and mid-career artists to advance their practice and develop new works for the Joyce stage. New commissions are supported by the Stephen and Cathy Weinroth Fund for New Works, a $1 million endowment contributed by a Joyce board member.\n\nThe organization also mounts a range of education, school and family programs that range from structured class visits to Joyce performances, to lessons at schools and community centers with Joyce-affiliated teaching artists, to family matinees with discount tickets for children.\n\nIn 2004, The Joyce's proposal to operate a dance theater in the planned \"arts hub\" at the World Trade Center was accepted by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. The Joyce would have been one of several arts organizations at the facility, and proposed a 1,000-seat theater for major dance companies, with supporting programming.\n\nIn the ensuing years, the vision for the cultural center has evolved through multiple iterations and tenant lists. It is currently planned as The Ronald O. Perelman Performing Arts Center, a multi-venue facility encompassing a range of performing and media arts. The Joyce's role in the current plan for the center has not been announced.\n\nIn 1996, The Joyce purchased a dance performance and rehearsal facility at 155 Mercer Street in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood that was owned and operated by the Dia Art Foundation. The building had been used for dance since 1985, and was sold because of financial difficulties at Dia. The Joyce obtained the building for $1.5 million with support from the LuEsther T. Mertz Charitable Trust, the charitable organization established by the organization's longstanding benefactor LuEsther T. Mertz upon her death. The Joyce continued Dia's program of rehearsal space rental and performances in the 75-seat theater until 2012, when it accepted an unsolicited offer to sell the building for $27.25 million.\n\nIn December, 2009, the Joyce leased a rehearsal studio facility at 305 West 38th Street, in Manhattan's Garment District, that it operated under the name DANY [Dance Art New York] Studios. The facility contained 11 studios. The Joyce did not renew when its lease ended in 2016 and closed DANY.\n\n"}

The film stars Ritter, Kate Bosworth, Kristen Johnston, Geoff Stults, Jason Biggs, and Rachel Bilson. Ritter plays the main character, Kim, who lives with her two roommates, Deena (Bosworth) and Laura (Bilson), in Los Angeles. Kim becomes pregnant after a one-night stand so she turns to her friends for help. \"Life Happens\" was released theatrically on April 13, 2012.\n\nDeena (Kate Bosworth) and Kim (Krysten Ritter) each bring home a guy one night. Realizing they have no condoms, they go looking around in their house where Kim ultimately finds the last one, but Deena takes it and Kim has unprotected sex. One year later, Kim is a single mother. She still lives with her two girlfriends, Deena and Laura (Rachel Bilson), while trying to juggle her son named Max. She takes Max to his father Mark (Coiro), but he announces that he is not interested in being a father. Kim brings Max along to work with her one day, as a dog service company assistant to her youth-obsessed boss Francesca (Kristen Johnston). Francesca reprimands Kim for bringing Max with her and says that she would be fired if she does it again. Kim then takes Max to her grandfather (Seymour Cassel) who is currently living in a retirement home.\n\nMeanwhile, Deena tries to finish writing her book in a library and ends up hooking up with a guy. One night, as Kim works as a bouncer in one of Francesca's parties, she falls for a guy named Nicolas (Geoff Stults) who was with two of his friends, Henri (Justin Kirk) and Sergei (Jason Biggs), attending the party. That night, Francesca finally allows Kim to have a break and meet up with Nicolas who promised to buy her a drink earlier and they spend the night getting to know each other. They quickly form a relationship after Nicolas intently asks Francesca to have Kim take his dog in his house. Kim brings along Max with her yet again where she lies to Nicolas that Max is a child of one of her roommates and that she was just relied on to look after Max. Kim asks Deena to come with her on her date with Nicolas that evening where Deena agrees. Nicholas arrives along with his friend Henri, where they look to Deena as her roommate with the baby. Kim begs Deena to just go with the lie they have come up with where Deena responds that it wouldn't take long enough for them to know that Kim is the one with a baby. They have a double date where it seems that Deena and Henri are attracted to each other, although Henri dresses up in hippie clothing.\n\nThe next day, Deena seems promoted from her career as a writer when someone could recognize her from an article she wrote. Kim on the other hand, seems to be an underdog as Francesca wouldn't allow to invest in her own dog service business. Laura, the other roommate seems to be unstable as she has been shifting jobs every week. Kim asks her to take care of Max since she has a date with Nicholas that night, but tells her she can't. She then freaks out and calls Deena who isn't answering her calls. Finally, she asks a young boy to babysit Max for her. Nicolas and Kim have sex after their romantic date, but it is not long before Nicolas discovers Kim's secret when milk leaks out of her breasts. This leaves Nicholas upset and Kim leaves.\n\nOn her way home, she sees a paramedic leave and asks Deena what happened. Kim yells at Deena for not returning home early where Deena strikes back at her saying that Max is her responsibility and there is nothing that could excuse her behavior. Deena and Kim's friendship is compromised. Kim spends all day around the house and finally quits her job telling Francesca she never looked 21. The next day, Kim informs Deena that she has to move out of the house and focus her life on being a mother and as for Deena, her successful career. Kim buys a house and visits Mark who regrets everything he said about not being ready and he wants a shot of being a dad for once. Laura then enters a show competition and seems to be successful. Kim finally reconciles with Deena and Nicolas where they all play pool together.\n\n\nIn an interview, Ritter described how she and Coiro came up with the movie's plot. \"Kat and I have been longtime friends. We’re both very psychotically driven, hard-working young women, and we always had this plan to dominate the world, like the two characters in the movie. We started writing and she had a baby, and we had this eureka moment where we just realized that’s the story we wanted to tell, about young girls, figuring out who they are and trying to have it all, but also when you throw a baby in the mix, it creates a whole other set of challenges.\"\n\n\"Life Happens\" premiered at the Los Angeles Film Festival and has been chosen as a selection to the 2012 Tribeca Film Festival.\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 26%, based on 31 reviews, and an average rating of 4.3/10. On Metacritic, which assigns normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 44 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nRichard Roeper of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" called \"Life Happens\" \"a much milder and more grounded comedy than the recent \"Bridesmaids\", with a smart if somewhat contrived script\".\n\nGary Goldstein of the \"Los Angeles Times\" said \"the film is rarely hijacked by its more familiar themes and sitcom potential. Instead, aided by a nimbly voluble script by Kat Coiro and Ritter, it emerges as an amusing kaleidoscope of contemporary urban angst and romantic aspirations.\" Justin Lowe of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" liked the relationship between the women but thought the \"execution dissipate[d] most of the film's potential\". Elizabeth Weitzman of \"The New York Daily News\" rated the film three out of five stars, noting that the filmmakers \"spice up the formula just enough to keep us watching\".\n\nThe soundtrack was arranged by Mateo Messina, who also worked on the music for the film \"Juno\". Ritter, also a singer, contributes a number of songs to the soundtrack.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1964666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1964666", "title": "Molon labe", "text": "Molon labe\n\nMolon labe ( ), meaning \"come and take [them]\", is a classical expression of defiance. According to Plutarch, Xerxes I—king of the Achaemenid Empire—demanded that the Spartans surrender their weapons and King Leonidas I responded with this phrase. It is an exemplary use of a laconic phrase.\n\nWhen properly transliterated with diacritics, the spelling becomes \"molṑn labe\". The literal translation is \"having come, take\". While English normally requires an explicit object in a transitive imperative construction (\"Take them!\" or \"Take it!\"), Ancient Greek does not; the object \"them\" is understood from context.\n\nThe first word, ', is the aorist active participle (masculine, nominative, singular) of the Greek verb ' \"to come\", meaning \"having come\". The root is evidently ΜΟΛ, so that βλώ-σκ-ω is apparently a contraction for μ(ο)λώ-σκ-ω, where the cluster *μλ- regularly becomes βλ-. Where English would put two main verbs in two independent clauses joined by a conjunction: \"come and take\", a strategy sometimes called paratactic, Ancient Greek, which is far richer in participles, subordinates one to the other, a strategy called hypotactic: \"having come\", \"take\". The first action is expressed with a participle with adverbial force. In this structure, the participle gives some circumstance (the coming) attendant on the main verb (the taking).\n\nThe aorist participle may be used where the action is completed, called the perfective aspect. That is: the action of the participle occurs before that of the main verb. Thus the Greek provides a nuance similar to the English translation (come and [then] take it), making clear that the coming must precede the taking (i.e., \"having come, take\"). The latter is in second person singular, and therefore is not being spoken to a large group of people, but rather to an individual. King Leonidas spoke to Xerxes personally, and not to the Persians en masse.\n\nA better Greek designation of the relationship between the participle and the imperative verb is to view the participle not as adverbial (circumstantial) but rather as a verbal participle of attendant circumstances. The indicators of this usage are that the participle typically precedes the main verb and is in the aorist tense while the main verb is in either the indicative or imperative mood (here the imperative). Finally, the usage normally (but not always) occurs within narrative literature (Daniel Wallace, \"Greek Grammar beyond the Basics\" [Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1996], 640–45). With these structures in mind, the participle then \"borrows\" the mood of the main verb and then adds the conjunction \"and\" after translating the participle. \"Come and take!\"\n\nWhen a more refined understanding of aspect is introduced (see, for example, Stanley Porter, Verbal Aspect in the Greek of the New Testament, with Reference to Tense and Mood, Peter Lang, 1993, a work covering Homeric through NT Greek), the translation of the aorist participle may be seen as devoid of time (the participle here not as temporally \"first\"). Instead, the use of the aorist form with the present-form imperative conveys the speaker's conception of a process, not a sequence. (Time in ancient Greek is marked by different feature called deixis.) Thus, the aorist form gives completeness (not completion) or a view of the \"coming on\" process by wide-angle lens, whereas the present form conveys immersion in the process of \"taking\"--a semantic framework alien to time-based English, hobbled by the time-term \"tense.\" In aspectual terms, the aorist is thus designated perfective (not perfected) and the present as imperfective (not imperfect, and designates incompleteness and intimate immersion); this arrangement is referred to as \"binary opposition\" (perfective-imperfective), permeating ancient Greek. The result is a pithy saying that to the ancient Greek speaker conveys the sense, \"Come on, take them!\" as a conceptual singularity (no sequence, no conjunction). Note that the so-called circumstantial participle is actually an integral feature of the imperative itself, its head word. The speaker integrates the two elements while preserving the force of their individual aspects (not moods) essential to framing his mental picture. This process strategy sets the semantic stage: the aorist giving the broad context within which resides the intimacy of an envisioned clash.\n\nThe phrase was reportedly the defiant response of King Leonidas I of Sparta to Xerxes I of Persia when Xerxes demanded that the Greeks lay down their arms and surrender. This was at the onset of the Battle of Thermopylae (480 BC). Instead, the Greeks held Thermopylae for three days. Although the Greek contingent was defeated, they inflicted serious damage on the Persian army. Most importantly, this delayed the Persians' progress to Athens, providing sufficient time for the city's evacuation to the island of Salamis. Though a tactical defeat, Thermopylae served as a strategic and moral victory, inspiring the Greek forces to crush the Persians at the Battle of Salamis later the same year and the Battle of Plataea one year later.\n\n\"Molon labe\" has been repeated by many later generals and politicians to express an army's or nation's determination not to surrender. The motto is on the emblem of the I Army Corps of Greece and the Second Infantry Division of Cyprus, and is also the motto of United States Special Operations Command Central (SOCCENT). The use of the phrase in the new world is first noted in 1778 at Fort Morris in the Province of Georgia during the American revolution, and later in 1835 at the Battle of Gonzales during the Texas Revolution where it became a prevalent slogan.\n\n\"Molon labe\" has been used once again in Greek history, on 3 March 1957, during a battle in Cyprus between members of the EOKA organization and the British Army. After someone had betrayed his location, the British forces surrounded the hideout of the second-in-command of EOKA, Grigoris Afxentiou, near the Machairas Monastery. Inside the hideout were Afxentiou and four of his followers. Realizing he was outnumbered, Afxentiou ordered them to surrender themselves while he barricaded himself for a fight to the death. The British asked Afxentiou to come out and surrender. He replied with the phrase \"Molon labe\", imitating the ancient Spartans. Unable to get him out, and after sustaining casualties, the British set fire to the hideout, and he was burnt alive. The British buried his body in the yard of the central jail of Nicosia, where it lies today.\n\nIn the United States, the original Greek phrase and its English translation are often heard as a defense of the right to keep and bear arms. It began to appear on websites in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In the Second Amendment or firearms freedom context, the phrase expresses the notion the person uttering the phrase is a strong believer in these ideals and will not surrender their firearms to anyone, especially to governmental authority.\n\nIn college football, the Michigan State Spartans football team wore alternate jerseys featuring the phrase in their 2011 rivalry game with the Michigan Wolverines.\n\n"}
{"id": "32653042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32653042", "title": "Monologist", "text": "Monologist\n\nA monologist (), or interchangeably monologuist (), is a solo artist who recites or gives dramatic readings from a monologue, soliloquy, poetry, or work of literature, for the entertainment of an audience. The term can also refer to a person who monopolizes a conversation; and, in an obsolete sense, could describe a bird with an unchanging, repetitive song.\n\nA dramatic monologist is a term sometimes applied to an actor performing in a monodrama often with accompaniment of music. In a monodrama the lone player relays a story through the eyes of a central character, though at times may take on additional roles. In the modern era the more successful practitioners of this art have been actresses frequently referred to by the French term “diseuse”.\n\nDiseuse (, ), French for \"teller\", also called talkers, storytellers, dramatic-singers or dramatic-talkers, is a term, at least on the English-speaking stage, that appears to date back only to the last decade of the 19th century. The early uses of “diseuse” as a theatrical term in the American press seem to coincide with Yvette Guilbert’s tour of New York City in the mid-1890s. \"Cosmopolitan Magazine\" in a February 1896 article on Guilbert described the term as a \"newly-coined and specific title\". Diseuse is the feminine form of the French word \"diseur\" \"teller\", a derivative of \"dire\" \"to say, to tell\", which in turn came from Latin \"dīcere\". It would appear that over the last century or so few male actors became noteworthy performing solely as a dramatic monologist, though many well known actors have played in monodramas over their careers.\n\nThe publication \"Theatre World\" wrote in a 1949 piece: \"In our time we have fallen under the spell of three remarkable women practising the art of the diseuse—Ruth Draper, Cornelia Otis Skinner, and Joyce Grenfell. Each of these great artists has the gift of crowding the stage with imaginary figures who become so vivid as to be practically visible, but as all of these artists happen to be members of the fair sex it could be assumed that they possess a magic denied the mere male of the theatre.\" The article goes on to suggest that Sid Field was an actor of comparable talents.\n\nIn the book \"The Guest List\" by Ethan Mordden, the art of the diseuse is defined as \"a speaker of lyrics: in effect, one who uses the music to get to the words\".\n\nIn the December 21, 1935, edition of the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" an entertainment columnist wrote:The English language does not contain a word which perfectly describes the performance of Ruth Draper, who comes to the Nixon next Thursday for the first time in several years to give a different program at each of her four performances here. \"Speaking Portraits\" and \"Character Sketches\" are the two terms most frequently applied to Miss Draper's work; and yet it is something more than that. \"Diseuse\" is the French word, but that is more readily applicable to an artist like Yvette Guilbert or Raquel Meller. Monologist is wholly inadequate. The word \"Diseuse\" really means \"an artist in talking\" so that may be the real term to use in connection with Miss Draper.\n\nJoyce Grenfell wrote in \"Darling Ma: Joyce Grenfell's Letters to her Mother 1932–1944\", \"What makes a good diseuse is a capacious verbal (and visual) imagination, and an excellent oral delivery. Call these witty ladies Diseuses of the Heart and Lungs. I do.\"\n\nActresses who have been called noted diseuses over the years include Yvette Guilbert, Ruth Draper, Joyce Grenfell, Cornelia Otis Skinner, Lucienne Boyer, Raquel Meller Odette Dulac, Beatrice Herford, \nKitty Cheatham, Marie Dubas, Claire Waldoff, Lina Cavalieri Françoise Rosay, Molly Picon, Corinna Mura, Lotte Lenya, Lia Rosen, a Jewish actress (German or possibly Austrian) who began by giving dramatic readings from the Old and New Testaments, Dela Lipinskaja, a Russian actress popular in Germany between the wars, Marjorie Moffett, American diseuse and author, and Albertine Zehme, a German actress from Leipzig who was close to Arnold Schoenberg.\n\nOral interpretation, sometimes called dramatic reading or interpretative reading, is the oral staging of a work of literature, prose or poetry, by a person who reads rather than memorizes the material. Typically they are performed by solo artists who – unlike players in a monodrama – do not assume or tell the story through any one character, but do so instead with oral nuances to bring the story alive with their interpretation of how the creator of the piece intended the story to be told.\n\nThe term soliloquist can apply to a monologist reciting a soliloquy, usually from a play, to entertain an audience. Passages in which characters orally reveal their thoughts are probably most associated with the works of William Shakespeare.\n"}

{"id": "227612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=227612", "title": "Neoism", "text": "Neoism\n\nNeoism is a parodistic . It refers both to a specific subcultural network of artistic performance and media experimentalists, and more generally to a practical underground philosophy. It operates with collectively shared pseudonyms and identities, pranks, paradoxes, plagiarism and fakes, and has created multiple contradicting definitions of itself in order to defy categorization and historization\n\nDefinitions of Neoism were always disputed. The\nmain source of this is the undefinable concept of Neoism which created\nvastly different, tactically distorted accounts of Neoism and its\nhistory. Undisputed, however are the origin of the movement in the late 1970s Canada. It was initiated by Hungarian-born Canadian performance and media-artist Istvan Kantor aka Monty Cantsin in 1979, in Montreal. At around the same time the open-pop-star identity of Monty Cantsin was spread through the Mail Artist David Zack\n\nSchisms followed in the mid-1980s. Questions and concerns arose about whether the \"open pop star\" Monty Cantsin moniker was being overly associated with certain individuals. Later, writer Stewart Home sought to separate himself from the rest of the Neoist network, manifesting itself in Home's books on Neoism as opposed to the various Neoist resources in the Internet. In non-Neoist terms, Neoism could be called an international subculture which in the beginning put itself into simultaneous continuity and discontinuity with, among others, xperimental arts (such as Dada, Surrealism, Fluxus and Concept Art), punk, industrial music and electropop, political and religious free-spirit movements, Science Fiction literature, 'pataphysics and speculative science. Neoism also gathered players with backgrounds in graffiti and street erformance, language writing (later known as language poetry), experimental film and video, Mail Art, the early Church of the Subgenius and gay and lesbian culture. Neoism then gradually transformed from an active subculture into a self-written urban legend. As a side effect, many other subcultures, artistic and political groups since the late 1980s have—often vaguely—referred to or even opposed Neoism and thereby perpetuated its myth.\n\nSince the gradual disappearance of Neoism in the 1990s, brief offshoots have appeared including The Seven by Nine Squares, Stewart Home's frequent use of Karen Eliot (as well as Sandy Larson, Luther Blissett (nom de plume) and others) to replace Monty Cantsin as the embodiment of the open pop star concept. \"This project... confuses the restrictions that both define and delimit individual identity... Changing details, such as biographical particulars... are usually considered indispensible in securing the signature of an individual.\"\n\nNeoism, as a name for a different context, was coined in 1914 by the American satirist Franklin P. Adams as a parody of modern arts. Sydney J. Bounds used the word as the name of a planet in his 1977 Science Fiction story \"No Way Back\". In 1979, the name was reinitiated by Istvan Kantor aka Monty Cantsin for a subcultural -ism that grew out of the mail art network, particularly those parts of mail art that emphasized—rather than the exchange of artwork—alternative lifestyles, pranks, practical jokes, the use of pseudonyms and experimentation with identity In 1980 Monty spent two weeks at mail artist Ginny Lloyd's San Francisco Storefront., a one year living art project holding art events and installations in a storefront window. He lived in the space, compiled writings and launched his Blood Campaign.\n\nCentered on the idea of the \"open pop star\" or multiple persona Monty Cantsin in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, New York, New York and Baltimore, Maryland in the United States . Neoism quickly spread to other places in America, Europe and Australia and involved up to two dozens of Neoists. Until the late 1980s and before the mass availability of the Internet, the mail art network continued to be used as the main communication and propaganda channel for Neoism.\n\nNeoists refer to their strategies as \"the great confusion\" and \"radical play\". They were acted out in semi-private Apartment Festivals which took place in North America, Europe and Australia between 1980 and 1998 and in publications which sought to embody confusion and radical play rather than just describing it. Consequently, both Neoist festivals and Neoist writing experimented with radical undermining of identity, bodies, media, and notions of ownership and truth. Unlike typical postmodern currents, the experiment was practical and therefore existential. Monty Cantsin, for example, was not simply a collective pseudonym or mythical person, but an identity lived by Neoists in their everyday life.\n\nFor these purposes, Neoists employed performance, video, small press publications (such as \"Smile\", the international magazine of multiple origins) and computer viruses, but also food (Chapati), flaming steam irons and metal coat hangers (used as telepathic antennas). Borrowing from Thomas Pynchon, Neoism could be more suitably called an \"anarchist miracle\" of an international network of highly eccentric persons collaborating, often with extremist intensity, under the one shared identity of Monty Cantsin and Neoism.\n\nIn 2004 Neoism was cited by Javier Ruis in response to the National Assembly Against Racism's condemnation of anarchists disrupting the Third European Social Forum session on anti- m and anti-racism in London (PGA Considered As Neoist Invisible Theatre).\n\nIn the early 1980s, the Neoist Reinhard U. Sevol founded Anti-Neoism, which other Neoists adopted by declaring\nNeoism a pure fiction created by Anti-Neoists. The Dutch Neoist Arthur Berkoff operated as a one-person-movement \n\"Neoism/Anti-Neoism/Pregroperativism\". Similarly, Blaster Al Ackerman declared himself a \"Salmineoist\" after Sicilian-American actor Sal Mineo, and John Berndt was credited by Ackerman as having given Neoism the name \"Spanish Art,\" circa 1983. In 1989, following the post-Neoist \"Festival of Plagiarism\" in Glasgow, Scotland, artist Mark Bloch left mail art and after publishing \"The Last Word\" remained defiantly silent on Neoism for almost two decades. In 1994, Stewart Home founded the Neoist Alliance as an occult order with himself as the magus. At the same time, Italian activists of the Luther Blissett project operated under the name \"Alleanza Neoista\".\n\nIn 1997, the critic Oliver Marchart organized a \"Neoist World Congress\" in Vienna which did not involve any Neoists. In 2001, the Professional Association of Visual Artists in the German city of Wiesbaden declared itself Neoist. In 2004 Istvan Kantor received the Governor General's Award, and an international \"Neoist Department Festival\" took place in Berlin.\n\nNotable artists who participated in Neoist apartment festivals include early street artist Richard Hambleton, writer and director Kirby Malone, media artist Niels Lomholt, visual artist Peter Below, media artist Bill Vorn, the filmmaker Michael Brynntrup and the model and actress Eugenie Vincent.\n\nNeoist \"play\" such as multiple names, plagiarism and pranks were adopted, frequently mistaken for Neoism proper and by mixing in situationist concepts, by other subcultures such as the Plagiarism and Art Strike 1990-1993 campaigns of the late 1980s (triggered largely by Stewart Home after he had left the Neoist network), Plunderphonics music, the refounded London Psychogeographical Association, the Association of Autonomous Astronauts, the Luther Blissett project, the Michael K Project, the German Communication Guerilla, and, since the late 1990s, by some net artists such as 0100101110101101.org. Other artists who explicitly if vaguely credit Neoism are The KLF, Luther Blissett, Alexander Brener/Barbara Schurz, Lee Wells and Luke Haines (of The Auteurs and Black Box Recorder). The contemporary Dutch Artist Thomas Raat created a series of artworks based on Neoist manifestos and photographic documents.\n\nNeoism is also mentioned briefly in David O. Russell's 2005 film I ♥ Huckabees. Dustin Hoffman's character says the word under his breath in response to Jason Schwartzman's experience to \"the blanket thing,\" which is a method of understanding the universe derived from being zipped up in a body bag.\n\nThe California-based tech-pop band Brilliant Red Lights also applies the word in the song \"Neoism,\" the first track off their second album, Actualism. The band imagines a literal—albeit applicable—definition of the word, defining it as \"the culture of the new.\"\n\nIn 2017, Istvan Kantor was featured in hiphop artists Future and The Weeknd's music video Coming Out Strong, prominently showing a tattoo of the word \"NEOISM\" on his head.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21151", "title": "New wave music", "text": "New wave music\n\nNew wave is a genre of rock music popular in the late 1970s and the 1980s with ties to mid-1970s punk rock. New wave moved away from blues and rock and roll sounds to create rock music (early new wave) or pop music (later) that incorporated disco, mod, and electronic music. Initially new wave was similar to punk rock, before becoming a distinct genre. It subsequently engendered subgenres and fusions, including synth-pop.\n\nNew wave differs from other movements with ties to first-wave punk as it displays characteristics common to pop music, rather than the more \"artsy\" post-punk. Although it incorporates much of the original punk rock sound and ethos, new wave exhibits greater complexity in both music and lyrics. Common characteristics of new wave music include the use of synthesizers and electronic productions, and a distinctive visual style featured in music videos and fashion.\n\nNew wave has been called one of the definitive genres of the 1980s, after it was promoted heavily by MTV (the Buggles' \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" music video was broadcast as the first music video to promote the channel's launch). The popularity of several new wave artists is often attributed to their exposure on the channel. In the mid-1980s, differences between new wave and other music genres began to blur. New wave has enjoyed resurgences since the 1990s, after a rising \"nostalgia\" for several new wave-influenced artists. Subsequently, the genre influenced other genres. During the 2000s, a number of acts, such as the Strokes, Interpol, Franz Ferdinand and The Killers explored new wave and post-punk influences. These acts were sometimes labeled \"new wave of new wave\".\n\nThe catch-all nature of new wave music has been a source of much confusion and controversy. The 1985 discography \"Who's New Wave in Music\" listed artists in over 130 separate categories. The \"New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock\" calls the term \"virtually meaningless\", while AllMusic mentions \"stylistic diversity\".\n\nNew wave first emerged as a rock genre in the early 1970s, used by critics including Nick Kent and Dave Marsh to classify such New York-based groups as the Velvet Underground and New York Dolls. It gained currency beginning in 1976 when it appeared in UK punk fanzines such as \"Sniffin' Glue\" and newsagent music weeklies such as \"Melody Maker\" and \"New Musical Express\". In November 1976 Caroline Coon used Malcolm McLaren's term \"new wave\" to designate music by bands not exactly punk, but related to the same musical scene. The term was also used in that sense by music journalist Charles Shaar Murray in his comments about the Boomtown Rats. For a period of time in 1976 and 1977, the terms new wave and punk were somewhat interchangeable. By the end of 1977, \"new wave\" had replaced \"punk\" as the definition for new underground music in the UK.\nIn the United States, Sire Records chairman Seymour Stein, believing that the term \"punk\" would mean poor sales for Sire's acts who had frequently played the club CBGB, launched a \"Don't Call It Punk\" campaign designed to replace the term with \"new wave\". As radio consultants in the United States had advised their clients that punk rock was a fad, they settled on the term \"new wave\". Like the filmmakers of the French new wave movement (after whom the genre was named), its new artists were anti-corporate and experimental (e.g. Ramones and Talking Heads). At first, most U.S. writers exclusively used the term \"new wave\" for British punk acts. Starting in December 1976, \"The New York Rocker\", which was suspicious of the term \"punk\", became the first American journal to enthusiastically use the term starting with British acts, later appropriating it to acts associated with the CBGB scene. Part of what attracted Stein and others to new wave was the music’s stripped back style and upbeat tempos, which they viewed as a much needed return to the energetic rush of rock and roll and 1960s rock that had dwindled in the 1970s with the ascendance of overblown progressive rock and stadium spectacles.\n\nMusic historian Vernon Joynson claimed that new wave emerged in the UK in late 1976, when many bands began disassociating themselves from punk. Music that followed the anarchic garage band ethos of the Sex Pistols was distinguished as \"punk\", while music that tended toward experimentation, lyrical complexity or more polished production, came to be categorized as \"new wave\". In the U.S., the first new wavers were the not-so-punk acts associated with the New York club CBGB (e.g. Talking Heads, Mink DeVille and Blondie).\n\nCBGB owner Hilly Kristal, referring to the first show of the band Television at his club in March 1974, said, \"I think of that as the beginning of new wave.\" Furthermore, many artists who would have originally been classified as punk were also termed new wave. A 1977 Phonogram Records compilation album of the same name (\"New Wave\") features US artists including the Dead Boys, Ramones, Talking Heads and the Runaways.\n\nNew wave is much more closely tied to punk and came and went more quickly in the United Kingdom than in the United States. At the time punk began, it was a major phenomenon in the United Kingdom and a minor one in the United States. Thus when new wave acts started getting noticed in America, punk meant little to the mainstream audience and it was common for rock clubs and discos to play British dance mixes and videos between live sets by American guitar acts.\n\nPost-punk music developments in the UK became mainstream and were considered unique cultural events. By the early 1980s, British journalists largely had abandoned the term \"new wave\" in favor of subgenre terms such as \"synthpop\". By 1983, the term of choice for the US music industry had become \"new music\", while to the majority of US fans it was still a \"new wave\" reacting to album-based rock.\n\nNew wave died out in the mid-1980s, knocked out by guitar-driven rock reacting against new wave. \n\nIn the 21st century United States, \"new wave\" was used to describe artists such as Morrissey, Duran Duran, Cyndi Lauper and Devo. Late 1970s new wave acts such as the Pretenders and the Cars were more likely to be found on classic rock playlists than on new wave playlists there. Reflecting its British origins, the 2004 study \"Popular Music Genres: An Introduction\" had one paragraph dedicated to 1970s new wave artists in its punk chapter in contrast to a 20-page chapter on early 1980s synthpop.\n\nNew wave represented a break from the blues and rock & roll sounds of late 1960s to mid-1970s rock music. According to Simon Reynolds, the music had a twitchy, agitated feel to it. New wave musicians often played choppy rhythm guitars with fast tempos, and keyboards were common as were stop-start song structures and melodies. Reynolds noted that new wave vocalists sounded high-pitched, geeky and suburban. A nervous, nerdy persona was a common characteristic of new wave fans and acts such as Talking Heads, Devo and Elvis Costello. This took the forms of robotic dancing, jittery high-pitched vocals and clothing fashions such as suits and big glasses that hid the body.\nThis seemed radical to audiences accustomed to post-counterculture forms such as disco dancing and macho \"cock rock\" that emphasized a \"hang loose\" philosophy, open sexuality and sexual bravado. The majority of American male new wave acts of the late 1970s were from Caucasian middle-class backgrounds, and Theo Cateforis of Syracuse University theorized that these acts intentionally presented these exaggerated nerdy tendencies associated with their \"whiteness\" either to criticize it and/or to reflect their identity.\n\nThe British pub rock scene of the mid-1970s was the source of new wave acts such as Ian Dury, Nick Lowe, Eddie and the Hot Rods and Dr. Feelgood.\n\nSinger-songwriters who were \"angry\" and \"intelligent\" and who \"approached pop music with the sardonic attitude and tense, aggressive energy of punk\" such as Elvis Costello, Joe Jackson and Graham Parker were also part of the new wave music scene.\n\nA British revival of ska music on the 2 Tone label, led by the Specials, Madness, the English Beat, and Selecter were more politically oriented than other new wave genres.\n\nThe idea of rock music as a serious art form started in the late 1960s and was the dominant view of the genre at the time of new wave's arrival. New wave looked back or borrowed in various ways from the years just prior to this occurrence. One way this was done was by taking an ironic look at consumer and pop culture of the 1950s and early 1960s. The B-52's became most noted for a kitsch and camp presentation with their bouffant wigs, beach party and sci-fi movie references. Other groups that referenced the pre-progressive rock era were the Go-Go's, Blondie and Devo.\n\nIn the early 1980s, new wave acts embraced a crossover of rock music with African and African-American styles. Adam and the Ants and Bow Wow Wow, both acts with ties to former Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren, used Burundi-style drumming. The Talking Heads album \"Remain in Light\" was marketed and positivity reviewed as a breakthrough melding of new wave and African styles, although drummer Chris Frantz said that he found out about this supposed African influence after the fact. The 1981 U.S. number 1 single \"Rapture\" by Blondie was an homage to rap music. The song name-checked rap artists and Fab 5 Freddie appeared in the video for the song. Second British Invasion acts were influenced by funk and disco.\n\nThe genre produced numerous one-hit wonders.\n\nPower pop continued the guitar-based, singles-oriented British invasion sound of the mid-1960s into the 1970s and the present day. Although the name \"power pop\" had been around before punk (it is believed to have been coined by Pete Townshend in 1967) it became widely associated with new wave when \"Bomp\" and \"Trouser Press\" magazines (respectively in March and April 1978) wrote cover stories touting power pop as a sound that could continue new wave's directness without the negativity associated with punk. Cheap Trick, the Romantics, the Records, Shoes, the Motors, the Only Ones, the Plimsouls, the dB's, the Beat, XTC, the Vapors, 20/20 and Squeeze were groups that found success playing this style. The Jam was the prime example of the mod sensibility of British power pop. By the end of 1979 a backlash had developed against power pop in general, particularly in regards to the Los Angeles scene. The skinny ties worn by LA power pop groups, epitomized by the Knack, became symbolic of the supposed lack of authenticity of the genre. Power pop's association with the genre was later forgotten.\n\nThe term \"post-punk\" was coined to describe groups such as Siouxsie and the Banshees, Wire, Magazine, Public Image Ltd, Joy Division, Gang of Four, the Fall, The Cure, the Psychedelic Furs and Echo and the Bunnymen which were initially considered part of new wave but were more ambitious, serious and challenging, as well as darker and less pop-oriented. Some of these groups would later adopt synths. While punk rock wielded a major influence on the popular music scene in the UK, in the US the music’s stigma of violence and sexual deviance made it virtually unmarketable.\n\nThe New Romantic scene developed in the London nightclubs Billy's and the Blitz in the late 1970s. Club-goers wore flamboyant, eccentric costumes and make-up derived from the historical Romantic era. Beginning at \"Bowie and Roxy Music\" themed nights at these clubs, the scene was spearheaded by Steve Strange of Visage, with other soon-to-be pop acts also as regular fixtures such as Boy George of Culture Club, and Spandau Ballet. Around the same time, Duran Duran emerged from a similar scene in Birmingham. Many of the acts that arose from the New Romantic club scene adopted synthpop in their own music, though all would credit David Bowie and Roxy Music as primary influences, both musically and visually.\n\nKraftwerk were acclaimed for their groundbreaking use of synthesizers. Their 1975 pop single \"Autobahn\" reached number 11 in the United Kingdom. In 1978, Gary Numan saw a synthesizer left by another music act and started playing around with it. In 1979, he released two number one albums and two number one singles (one of each under his band name Tubeway Army). Numan's admitted amateurism and deliberate lack of emotion was a sea change from the masculine and professional image that professional synth players had in an era when elaborate, lengthy solos were the norm. His open desire to be a pop star broke from punk orthodoxy. The decreasing price and ease of use of the instrument led acts to follow in Kraftwerk and Numan's footsteps. While Numan also utilized conventional rock instruments, several acts that followed used only synthesizers. Synthpop (or \"technopop\" as it was described by the U.S. press) filled a void left by disco, and grew into a broad genre that included groups such as the Human League, Eurythmics, Depeche Mode, Soft Cell, a-ha, New Order, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, Japan, Yazoo, Ultravox, Kajagoogoo, and the Thompson Twins.\n\nIn the summer of 1977 both \"Time\" and \"Newsweek\" wrote favorable lead stories on the \"punk/new wave\" movement.<ref name=\"punk/newwave\">[ Genre Punk/New Wave Allmusic]</ref> Acts associated with the movement received little or no radio airplay or music industry support. Small scenes developed in major cities. Continuing into the next year, public support remained limited to select elements of the artistic, bohemian and intellectual population, as arena rock and disco dominated the charts.\n\nStarting in late 1978 and continuing into 1979, acts associated with punk and acts that mixed punk with other genres began to make chart appearances and receive airplay on rock stations and rock discos. Blondie, Talking Heads, the Police and the Cars charted during this period. \"My Sharona\", a single from the Knack, was \"Billboard\" magazine's number one single of 1979. The success of \"My Sharona\" combined with the fact that new wave albums were much cheaper to produce during a time when the music industry was in its worst slump in decades, prompted record companies to sign new wave groups. New wave music scenes developed in Ohio and the college town of Athens, Georgia, with legendary bands like The B-52s and R.E.M.. 1980 saw brief forays into new wave-styled music by non-new wave artists Billy Joel, Donna Summer and Linda Ronstadt.\n\nEarly in 1980, influential radio consultant Lee Abrams wrote a memo saying that with a few exceptions, \"we're not going to be seeing many of the new wave circuit acts happening very big over here (referring to America). As a movement, we don't expect it to have much influence.\" Lee Ferguson, a consultant to KWST, said in an interview that Los Angeles radio stations were banning disc jockeys from using the term and noted, \"Most of the people who call music new wave are the ones looking for a way not to play it.\" Despite the success of Devo's socially critical but widely misperceived song \"Whip It\", second albums by artists who had successful debut albums, along with newly signed artists, failed to sell, and radio pulled most new wave programming.\n\nThe arrival of MTV in 1981 would usher in new wave's most successful era in the United States. British artists, unlike many of their American counterparts, had learned how to use the music video early on. Several British acts on independent labels were able to outmarket and outsell American artists on major labels. Journalists labeled this phenomenon a \"Second British Invasion\". MTV continued its heavy rotation of videos by new wave-oriented acts until 1987, when it changed to a heavy metal and rock dominated format.\n\nIn a December 1982 Gallup poll, 14% of teenagers rated new wave music as their favorite type of music, making it the third most popular. New wave had its greatest popularity on the West Coast. Unlike other genres, race was not a factor in the popularity of new wave music, according to the poll. Urban Contemporary radio stations were the first to play dance-oriented new wave artists such as the B-52's, Culture Club, Duran Duran and ABC.\n\nNew wave soundtracks were used in mainstream Brat Pack films such as \"Valley Girl\", \"Sixteen Candles\", \"Pretty in Pink,\" and \"The Breakfast Club\". John Hughes, the director of several of these films, was enthralled with British new wave music and placed songs from acts such as the Psychedelic Furs, Simple Minds, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and Echo and the Bunnymen in his films, helping to keep new wave in the mainstream. Several of these songs remain standards of the era. Critics described the MTV acts of the period as shallow or vapid. The homophobic slurs \"faggot\" and \"art fag\" were openly used to describe new wave musicians. Despite the criticism, the danceable quality of the music and the quirky fashion sense associated with new wave artists appealed to audiences.\n\nIn September 1988, \"Billboard\" launched their Modern Rock chart. While the acts on the chart reflected a wide variety of stylistic influences, new wave's legacy remained in the large influx of acts from Great Britain and acts that were popular in rock discos, as well as the chart's name, which reflected how new wave had been marketed as \"modern\". New wave's indie spirit would be crucial to the development of college rock and grunge/alternative rock in the latter half of the 1980s and beyond.\n\nIn the aftermath of grunge, the British music press launched a campaign to promote the New Wave of New Wave. This campaign involved overtly punk and new wave-influenced acts such as Elastica but was eclipsed by Britpop. Other acts of note during the 1990s included No Doubt, Metric, Six Finger Satellite and Brainiac. During that decade, the synthesizer-heavy dance sounds of British and European new wave acts influenced various incarnations of Euro disco and trance. Chris Martin was inspired to start Coldplay by a-ha.\n\nDuring the 2000s, a number of acts emerged that mined a diversity of new wave and post-punk influences. Among these were the Strokes, the Bravery, Interpol, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Franz Ferdinand, the Epoxies, VHS or Beta, the Rapture, She Wants Revenge, Bloc Party, Foals, Kaiser Chiefs and the Killers. These acts were sometimes labeled \"New New Wave\". The new wave revival reached its apex during the mid-2000s with acts such as the Sounds, the Ting Tings, Melody Club, Hot Chip, Passion Pit, the Presets, La Roux, Ladytron, Shiny Toy Guns, Hockey, Gwen Stefani and Ladyhawke. While some journalists and fans regarded this as a revival, others argued that the phenomenon was a continuation of the original movements.\n\nThe Drums are an example of the trend in the U.S. indie pop scene that employs both the sounds and attitudes of the British new wave era. A new wave-influenced genre called chillwave also developed in the late 2000s, exemplified by artists like Toro Y Moi, Neon Indian, Twin Shadow and Washed Out.\n\nNew wave had a seminal role in the development and popularity of contemporary electronic music.\n\nDuring the late 1990s, new wave received a sudden surge of attention when it was fused with electro and techno during the short-lived electroclash movement. It received popular attention from musical acts such as I-F, Peaches, Fischerspooner and Vitalic, but largely faded when it combined with tech house to form the electro house genre.\n\nDuring the mid 2000s, new rave combined new wave with elements from several other genres, such as indie rock and electro house, and added aesthetic elements archetypal of a rave, such as light shows and glow sticks. Despite the term itself stimulating controversy to the point where many affiliated artists rejected it, new rave as a musical genre was adopted by artists such as the Klaxons, NYPC, Shitdisco and Hadouken!\n\nIn the 2010s, Nostalgia for 1980s new wave has seen a resurgence in the form of synthwave, which is primarily characterized by new wave, soundtrack influences and a retrofuturistic, cyberpunk-like visual aesthetic. This term is applied to the music of artists such as Kavinsky, College, Power Glove, Mitch Murder, and , as well as soundtracks of films and video games such as \"Drive\", \"\", \"Hotline Miami\", \"Kung Fury\", \"Turbo Kid\", and \"\".\n\nNew wave music experienced a lot of mainstream success during the late 1970s and also during the 1980s. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Blondie had 4 songs on at number 1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.

Pan-Asian was founded by Tisa Chang in 1977 \"with her salary from six months of The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel with Al Pacino,\" who continues on today as artistic director. Chang established the Pan Asian Repertory Theatre as a resident company at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in 1977, with the intention of popularizing Asian-American theater. Mel Gussow of \"The New York Times\" noted that \"Before Pan Asian Rep, Asian Americans had severely limited opportunities in the theater… [now] heartened by Ms. Chang's example, similar companies have sprung up around the United States.\" For over thirty years, Pan Asian has created opportunities for underrepresented artists to stage modern classics that give insight into the Asian-American experience.\n\nSpecializing in intercultural productions of new Asian-American plays, Asian classics in translation, and innovative adaptations of Western classics, some of the works Pan Asian has presented included: \nPan Asian has staged early works of writers including Momoko Iko, Wakako Yamauchi, Philip Kan Gotanda, R. A. Shiomi, and David Henry Hwang. \n\nPan Asian Rep had a season in the West End Theatre in the Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew, and in 2007 returned to the Julia Miles Theatre to revive their classic productions with a large cast. Major programs include the Senior Artist Resident Ensemble, the Theatre For Youth program, touring and residencies domestically and internationally, the Staged Reading Series directed by Ron Nakahara, and Actor Training Workshops taught by Ernest Abuba.\n\nThe company has been invited to several national theater festivals including Edinburgh in 1988, Singapore in 1992, Cairo and Johannesburg (1995), and the Xi Havana Theatre Festival in 2003. From June 11–24, 2007, Pan Asian served along with Ma-Yi Theater and NAATCO as a Co-Steering Committee member of the first National Asian American Theatre Festival. The two-week festival brought work from more than 35 emerging and established artists and ensembles from across the United States to 13 venues around New York City.\n\nPan Asian celebrated its 39th anniversary in 2016, and continues a cycle of Masterpiece productions. The cycle began in 2007 with \"The Joy Luck Club,\" a play by Susan Kim adapted from the novel by Amy Tan, directed and choreographed by Tisa Chang. In 2008, Pan Asian presented the first professional theatrical production of \"The Missing Woman\", written and directed by Nguyen thi Minh Ngoc. The play was performed in Vietnamese and English, and enabled diverse audiences to explore themes of social justice and human rights through the lens of traditional Vietnamese art forms. \"The Missing Woman\" represented Pan Asian's efforts towards international artistic collaboration.\n\n\"Shogun Macbeth\" opened the 2008 season. Adapted by John R. Briggs from Shakespeare's Macbeth, the epic production combined medieval history with traditional Japanese techniques of Noh, Kyogen, and Samurai sword fighting, while retaining the complexity of Shakespearean language. Ernest Abuba, who had acted in the title role 22 years prior, directed the 2008 production. In the fall of 2009, the company produced \"Imelda\", a new musical based on the controversial figure of Imelda Marcos. Pan Asian Repertory Theatre and East West Players collaborated on this production, which was directed by Tim Dang, with the book by Sachi Oyama, lyrics by Aaron Coleman, music by Nathan Wang, and choreography by Reggie Lee.\n\nIn spring 2010, Pan Asian produced the East Coast premiere of \"Ching Chong Chinaman\", a comedy by Lauren Yee and directed by May Adrales. The work used the pejorative jingle to examine common assumptions about identity and culture. Pan Asian continued their relationship with Vietnamese audiences and artists with 2011's \"Vietnam Project II: Past and Present\". This included productions of Nguyen thi Minh Ngoc's \"We Are\", about Vietnamese women who work or marry abroad, and Derek Nguyen's \"Monster\", about a Vietnamese-American detective in search of a missing child and his past. The company's 35th anniversary season included \"Shanghai Lil's\" by Lilah Kan with music by Louis Stewart, a musical about the nightclub scene in San Francisco's Chinatown just prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor; and Mayank Keshaviah's \"Rangoon\", a world premiere about a family of Indian immigrants pursuing the American Dream.\n\nFor their 41st season starting in 2017, Pan-Asian Rep featured the show \"Daybreak\" by Joyce Van Dyke, which features the Armenian Genocide in the 1920s. If asked why Armenia, Chang replies: \"Because Pan Asian is all of Asia and Polynesia. And I also feel the Middle East needs to be represented. It’s a very affirming play and, again, a story seldom told. If anything, history tends to hide traumatic periods, so I think that it’s a great service we do presenting these stories.\"\n\n\n"}

Putlog holes may extend through a wall to provide staging on both sides of the wall.\n\nA historically common type of scaffolding, putlog holes date from ancient Roman buildings. The term putlock and the newer term putlog date from the 17th century and are still used today. Putlogs may be supported on the outer ends by vertical poles (standards), cantilevered by one end being firmly embedded in the wall, or cantilevered by penetrating the wall to provide scaffolds on both sides. Putlogs may be sawn off flush with the wall if they cannot be removed, but exterior putlog holes are typically filled in as the scaffold is removed to prevent water from entering the walls. Interior putlog holes may be left open, particularly if not in a finished space.\n\nThe inconsequential size and the spacing of the holes meant that they did not affect the solidity of the walls, and in well-preserved castles, like Beaumaris, the ancient putlog holes can be seen to this day.\n\n"}

{"id": "37576058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37576058", "title": "Spatial icon", "text": "Spatial icon\n\nThe concept of the spatial icon, introduced by Alexei Lidov, plays a central role in hierotopy and is used to describe the perception of sacred spaces. Spatial icons are image-visions, that are evoked, for example, in the space of a temple or sanctuary. The spatial icon encompasses a broad range of components involved in the formation and definition of sacred spaces. It is a consciously created spatial image that transcends the material objects involved in its formation. A variety of plastic elements, including everything from buildings to decoration, and from murals to liturgical artifacts, work together to form a spatial icon. Sacred relics and iconic images often play an integral role in the creation of a comprehensive spatial image. Various dynamic and performative media also play a significant role, such as rituals and song, as well as the artistic manipulation of natural light, lighting and sounds, and also elements dealing with odor and touch. From this point of view, Medieval churches can be seen as spatial icons in which divine image-visions, such as Paradise or Heavenly Jerusalem, were incarnated in the sacred space by means of the various media employed without being directly depicted. The temples and sanctuaries of various religions were originally conceived, designed and created as spatial icons. In the Christian tradition in particular, impressive examples of spatial icons are to be found in re-creations of the Holy Land, or \"New Jerusalems\". In many cases, spatial icons were the work of specific authors; their art could be compared with that of contemporary film directors, for in both cases, there is the coordinated effort of various artists and specialists in shaping a single, comprehensive vision.\n\nPerformativity, as well as various dynamic elements, is a significant feature of spatial icons. Unlike a statue or building, they are constantly in motion, changing with the movement and activity of ritual and celebration, as well as with the alteration of light, odor and the movements of those participating and inhabiting them. The Tuesday performance surrounding the Hodegetria icon in Constantinople and the Donkey walk taking place in Medieval Moscow are classical examples of iconic performativity in the Eastern Christian tradition. In both cases, the city itself was temporarily transformed into the matrix of a spatial icon; the participants involved in these rituals were thus veritable co-creators of the sacred space along with the artists, priests and celebrants responsible for leading it. Another example of this performative element at work in spatial icons can be found in the ritual creation and destruction of the sand mandala in the Buddhist tradition.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27826482", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27826482", "title": "The Invisible Generation", "text": "The Invisible Generation\n\nThe Invisible Generation was a contemporary art project conceived by artist Per Hüttner and Curator Daniele Balit and organized by Vision Forum and created new meeting places between art and its audiences. A great number of projects were realized in Melbourne, Shenzhen, Beijing and Kiev in 2009-2010. For each city the program and artist list was totally new. No project was ever repeated twice. The project always allowed the audience to meet art in new and unexpected situations and played with or confused the audiences’ expectations about what art is, where it normally appears and what shape it should take.\n\nMost projects were realized in contexts where the audience does not necessarily expect to find artwork. In the metro (Dinu Li, Per Hüttner), in a newspaper office (Yan Jun), on a public square (Natasha Rosling) or even contained as a story in the mind of a person in a shop (Good TV). In other instances the project played with the perceived immutability of the artwork. The audience was asked to actively create or re-create artwork (The Anti-Hospital), remove or destroy drawings (Jean-François Robardet), bring books to be changed (Private Contractors) or in some cases it was disguised as an informative poster, graffity or political propaganda (Huang Xiaopeng, Per Hüttner).\n\nThe inspiration and title is taken from a text by William S. Burroughs where he describes a series of situation where a tape recorder is used to create new forms of meeting between people and new forms of engagement with the media.\n\nThe first part of The Invisible Generation opened to the public in Australia in September 2009. The presentation was co-curated by Hüttner and Balit. It was introduced at the Margaret Lawrence Gallery which was also the starting point for a number of interventions in the public space of the city. In the gallery were two major installations presented: Do Not Go Gentle Court by Per Hüttner and Polka Dot by French artist Mark Geffriaud. The two works redefine the gallery experience through reflections on the fabric of space and time. Being situated at the boundaries between installation and performance, they delineated a space that was the starting point for the Anti-Hospital, an open-ended and evolving platform which formed the core of the project. The Anti-Hospital was designed by Melbourne-based collective Greatest Hits and focused around a collection of artistic documents providing instructions that were formulated as possible actions, performances, temporary artworks, objects and social situations, scores and sonic interventions proposed by absent artists and realized by local artists, non-artists and visitors to the gallery. Greatest Hits created a dozen videos that enacted, played with and read out the instructions and together created a sort of manual to aid and inspire the visitor to relate to them. Many instructions were interpreted, primarily by local artists while the exhibition was open to the public.\n\nFor the period of the exhibition the Anti-Hospital also coordinated a series of events, performances, actions, workshops and ways of disseminating the instructions through the media and the urban space of Melbourne including, local artists, students and a program on the screen and LEDs at Federation Square. This included the controversial project “Young Dictators” conceived and realized by Per Hüttner with two local students. The three put up 2000 copies of A4 sized posters around the city showing images of dictators such as Adolf Hitler, Saddam Hussein and Joseph Stalin as children with the text “Have you seen this child? Please contact 0432 027 925” (Hüttner’s mobile number).\n\nWhere the presentation in Melbourne focused on the relationship between suspended instructions in the gallery and interventions in the public space, the project in Shenzhen consisted mostly of unannounced performances in the public space and hosted by the contemporary art museum OCAT. The shift in political, economical, social and architectural context also meant the dynamics of the project changed greatly and made the participation of the local audience more difficult to achieve, but all the more successful on the occasions where it happened. Presentations included carnivalesque costumes appearing in public space as temporary and wearable architectural elements by Natasha Rosling. Yang Zhifei carried a giant white pillow through the streets of the city and she let an army of people sleep in public spaces, each with a normally sized pillow under their head. She also organized a dream workshop to compare the dreams of the Chinese with those of the Dutch. Dinu Li created a choreography of corruption and guilt on the Shenzhen underground provoking fear in the audience and laying bare how deep inside the psyches of its citizens a totalitarian government can reach. Neno Belchev designed a portable zebra crossings to facilitate jaywalking, a passion shared by the Chinese and Bulgarians.\n\nThe events in Beijing took place over a whole year and culminated in a large presentation at Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in June 2010 Presentations kicked off with summer 2009 with Jon Phillips and Matt Hope’s speaker event \"Laoban Sound System\" in conjunction with Ai Weiwei’s day without internet. The two has since launched a range of events in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. Other events included Yan Jun’s sonic material slipped into the desk drawers at Beijing Youth Weekly editorial office and interviews from the same newspaper that were replayed and perverted over 6 weeks. Good TV collected memories of images that had been lost for different reasons. collection of lost images retold by storytellers in their everyday life in the Wudaoying Hutong (五道营胡同). The Beijing context and the proximity to the centre of political power allowed “This Image Is No More” to develop another layer of interpretation which had been lacking in its realization in Europe. Both Natasha Rosling and Yang Zhifei created versions of their projects from Shenzhen in Beijing. Especially the giant white pillow carried through the streets the Chinese capital to mirrored its grandiose buildings in ways that also inspired interesting reactions among the unassuming audience.\n\nIn November Yulia Usova and PAI organised a series of talks in Kiev that approached issues such as curation and art in public spaces and included speakers such as Olesya Turkina, Olav Westphalen and Karen MacDonald. In conjunction with this a group of students from Kungliga Konsthögskolan in Stockholm made a series of improvised performances at Les Kurbas’ Theater Center. A large part of the project took place during the swine flu epidemic in Ukraine all public theatre events were stopped and schools closed giving the whole event a very special flavour.\n\nThe actual project was scheduled to be realized in April 2010, but had to be cancelled due to the volcanic ash cloud that prevented air travel in Europe at the given time and only web-performances were undertaken. The project was realized 19 June and 2–4 July 2010 and was co-curated by Per Hüttner and Yulia Usova. The project saw a meeting between artists from China, Western Europe and Ukraine. Rumours claim that artists met with great problems with local authorities including arrests, theft by undercover policemen and that the artists had to bribe officials to be able to leave the country.\n\nSince most of the events in The Invisible Generation only had an unexpecting audience, the organizers present the documentation of the project in various art institutions around the world, including UCCA in Beijing and Norrköpings Konstmuseum in Sweden. Vision Forum has also published an extensive catalogue about The Invisible Generation in 2011. It was edited by Gerrie van Noord and includes all the original instructions presented in Melbourne. The publication also contains texts by Daniele Balit, Per Hüttner, Olav Westphalen and incidentally contains a reproduction of this page. The book is framed by three texts by the editor, Gerrie van Noord where she reflects on the difficulty and necessity of mediating projects ephemeral projects like The Invisible Generation.\n\nMark Geffriaud, Natasha Rosling Jon Phillips and Matt Hope, Neno Belchev, Yang Zhifei, Anne Klontz, Per Hüttner, Dinu Li, Hu Xiangqian, Josefin Wikström and Sarah Kim, Good TV, Yan Jun, Oksana Chepelyk, Oksana Plysyuk, Huang Xiaopeng, Oleg Chorny and Gena Khmaruk, Alexander Kokhanovsky, Jean-François Robardet, Klas Eriksson, Gang Don, TanzLaboratorium, PRIVATE CONTRACTORS (Olav Westphalen and Per Hüttner), Pauline Curnier Jardin and Volodymyr Karashevskyi.\n\nA Constructed World, Åsa Ersmark, Anna Scalfi, Carlo Steiner, Chen Wei, Chi Wo Leung, Christophe Bruno, Dinu Li, Etienne Cliquet, Gerrie van Noord, Hristina Ivanoska, Jean-Francois Robardet, Karen MacDonald, Kent Hanssen, Kylie Wilkinson, Natalia Kamia, Natalie Thomas, Pauline Curnier Jardin, Per Hüttner, Riccardo Benassi, Rik Bas Backer, Samon Takahashi, Seth Cluett, Veronica Kent and Sean Peoples, Yan Jun, James Webb, The Grossi Maglioni Magic Duo, Harriet Kate Morgan/Joint Hassles, USERNAME and Jon Phillips.\n\nThe following people have also participated in the various programs and events of the TIG in Melbourne: Amy Johannes, Kay Abude, Laura Whitfield, Ann Fuata, Jethro Harcourt, Lisa Imai, Alesh Macak, Pip Ryan, Sherry McLane Alejos, Kellie Wells, Nick Tammens, Sarah Haywood, Natalie Thomas, Kylie Wilkinson, Alex Rizkalla and Julie Davies.\n\n"}

The work is in the collection of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam in the Netherlands.\n\nThe oil painting on canvas is high and wide. The painting's subject is a life-size swan (\"Cygnus olor\") defending its nest against a dog. At the bottom right, the painting is signed with the monogram \"A\".\n\nBy 1800 when it was purchased, the painting was interpreted as a political allegory of grand pensionary (the highest official in Holland, the main province of the Dutch Republic) Johan de Witt protecting the country from its enemies. Three inscriptions had been added: the words \"de raad-pensionaris\" (the grand pensionary) between the swan's legs, the words \"de viand van de staat\" (the enemy of the state) above the head of the dog on the left, and the name \"Holland\" on the egg on the right.\n\nIn the 1790s this painting was in the collection of Jan Gildemeester and was included in the 1800 catalog of paintings (ordered alphabetically by artist) produced for his estate sale, though it was not included in Adriaan de Lelie's 1794 painting of the collection known as \"The Art Gallery of Jan Gildemeester Jansz\". The catalog states that it is an \"allegory of Raadpensionaris de Witt\". The painting was purchased by the art dealer Cornelis Sebille Roos for 100 guilders for the Nationale Konst-Gallery in The Hague, on behalf of the director Alexander Gogel. It is documented as the first purchase by that institution.\n\nIt has been speculated that the white text that was painted onto the painting was done during the Witten-Oorlog. The painting was purchased for the Nationale Konst-Gallery in The Hague in 1800 based on its allegorical reference, but only later did visitors point out that the painter had died long before the murder of the De Witt brothers took place.\n\n"}

It is best known as the theatre where Alfred Jarry’s nihilistic farce \"Ubu Roi\" premiered in 1896.\n\nFounded in Paris in 1893, the Théâtre de l'Œuvre was among the first theatrical venues in France to provide a home for the artists of the Symbolist Movement at the end of the nineteenth century. Modeled on the experimental structure of the Théâtre Libre, the venue was directed by Lugné-Poe, a prominent Parisian actor and stage manager from its opening through 1929.\n\nLugné-Poe had embraced symbolism's \"subjectivity, spirituality, and mysterious internal and external forces\" as a source of profound truth after working as an actor at the Théâtre d'Art. The first of the independent Symbolist theatre, the poet Paul Fort, then just seventeen years old, formed the company to explore the performance potential of found texts such as \"The Iliad\", \"The Bible\", and his own lyric verse. When Fort left the group in 1892, his work was carried on by what would become the Théâtre de l'Œuvre with Lugné-Poe at the helm.\n\nUnlike Fort's project which catered to the intellectual elite, Lugné-Poe sought to create a \"theatre for the people,\" and customarily offered free tickets to most of the public, reserving only 100 seats for his subscription holders. Under his direction, the company first performed Maurice Maeterlinck's \"Pelléas et Mélisande\" on May 17, 1892. According to theatre historian Oscar Brockett:\n\nWith the help of poet and critic Camille Mauclair and the painter Édouard Vuillard (with whom Lugné-Poe was sharing an apartment), the director dedicated the theatre to presenting the work of the young French Symbolist playwrights in addition to introducing new foreign dramas. The group established themselves that same year, renting a small room atop the cité Monthiers called the \"salle Berlioz\" and calling themselves \"Maison de l'Œuvre\", or literally, the \"House of Works.\" \n\nIn addition to those of Maeterlinck, the theatre also produced Sanskrit dramas in addition to works by foreign authors such as Oscar Wilde, Gerhart Hauptmann, August Strindberg, and Gabriele D’Annunzio, alongside works by young French dramatists like Henry Bataille, Henri de Régnier et Alfred Jarry. Lugné-Poe was also instrumental in introducing Henrik Ibsen’s plays to French audiences.\n\nJust as in the description of the theatre's initial performance, the majority Lugné-Poe's stage settings were simple, non-realistic representations of line and color on canvas backdrops. He sought to create a theatre of poetry and dreams while staying true to his motto, \"The word creates the decor.\" The staging was atmospheric and the acting stylized; costumes were usually simple and “timeless.” Some designers included Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Maurice Denis, Odilon Redon, Pierre Bonnard, and Vuillard himself.\n\nOn December 10, 1896, Théâtre de l'Œuvre presented Alfred Jarry's legendary \"Ubu Roi\", with actor Firmin Gémier in the title role. Jarry had finished this epochal play about human greed, cowardice, and stupidity just six months before it would shock the audiences with its unapologetic opening line, \"Merdre.\" Though Jarry affected an attitude of political indifference, his revolutionary ideas challenged assumptions about society, propriety, and existence. Brockett notes that \"\"Ubu Roi\" shows in all its grotesqueness a world without human decency.\" In this lithograph announcement by Jarry for the performance of Ubu Roi, King Ubu appears as a shadow puppet with a segmented arm. He brandishes a scimitar in one hand and clutches a sack of gold in the other.\nBy 1899 the Théâtre de l’Oeuvre had presented 51 programs and toured England, Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Belgium. In spite of this success, Lugné-Poe had come to feel that the work of the Symbolists was juvenile and limiting to his artistic development. He closed the theatre in 1899, marking an end to the first major phase of the anti-realism movement in the theatre.\n\nLugné-Poe revived the theatre December 22, 1912 with a production of Paul Claudel's \"L'Annonce faite à Marie.\" Following that were several works by the Dadaist and Surrealist writers of the era. The group was off to a running start, but activity was interrupted again with the beginning of World War I in 1914. They reopened again in 1919 with the help of financing from the actor Marcelle Frappa and ran the theatre continuously until his final retirement in 1929. Through their productions, tours, and critical reviews the Théâtre de l’Oeuvre, under the direction of Lugné-Poe, had managed to influence \"almost every departure from realism between 1893 and 1915.\"\n\nLucien Beer and Paulette Pax succeeded Lugné-Poe in 1929 and served as the theatre's directors until the beginning of World War II. Shortly after the conflict began, Hitler conquered France and the Vichy Regime under Jacques Hébertot made most theatres illegal in the occupied zone. After the Liberation of Paris in 1944, Raymond Rouleau rejoined Lucien Beer, and together they ran the theatre until 1951, when they were both replaced by Robert de Ribon.\n\nIn 1960 Pierre Franck and Georges Herbert took over direction. They ran the theatre until 1978, when they were replaced by Georges Wilson as Artistic Director and principal scenic designer. He remained until 1995 when Gérard Maro, who had been Artistic Director of the Comédie de Paris since 1981 took over as chef of the Théâtre de l'Œuvre. He is still in charge today.\n\n"}

The movement was mainly involved in visual arts, graphic design, poetry, literature, theatre, film, architecture and music. Like other avant-garde movements at the time, it held anti-war, anti-bourgeois and anti-nationalist views and rejected traditional culture and art. Micić defined the movement as \"abstract metacosmic expressionism.\"\n\nMost of its ideas were communicated through the Zenit magazine which Ljubomir Micić launched and which published 43 issues.\n\nThe movement was established following World War I, during which Yugoslavia lost a million inhabitants. Although some artists from the region were known in Europe, Zenitism was the first notable art movement from the Balkans in Europe.\n\n"}
