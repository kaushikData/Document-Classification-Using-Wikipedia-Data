{"id": "2770911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2770911", "title": "A Million Little Pieces", "text": "A Million Little Pieces\n\nA Million Little Pieces is a book by James Frey, originally sold as a memoir and later marketed as a semi-fictional novel following accusations of literary forgery. It tells the story of a 23-year-old alcoholic and drug abuser and how he copes with rehabilitation in a twelve steps-oriented treatment center. While initially promoted as a memoir, it was later discovered that many of the events described in the book never happened.\n\nA badly tattered James awakens on an airplane to Chicago, with no recollection of his injuries or of how he ended up on the plane. He is met by his parents at the airport, who take him to a rehabilitation clinic. We find out that James is 23 years old, and has been an alcoholic for ten years, and a crack addict for three. He is also wanted by the police in three different states on several charges.\n\nAs he checks into the rehab clinic, he is forced to quit his substance abuse, a transition that we find out later probably saves his life, but is also an incredibly agonizing event. As part of this, he is forced to undergo a series of painful root canals, without any anesthesia because of possible negative reactions to the drugs. He copes with the pain by squeezing tennis balls until his nails crack (when challenged on this specific incident during his second \"Oprah\" appearance, Frey said that it \"may\" have been \"more than one\" root canal procedure and may or may not have included Novocaine, as he remembers it).\n\nThe book follows Frey through the painful experiences that lead up to his eventual release from the center, including his participation in the clinic's family program with his parents, despite his strong desire not to. Throughout the novel, Frey speaks of the \"Fury\" he is fighting, which he sees as the cause of his desire to drink alcohol and use drugs. The \"Fury\" could be seen as the antagonist of the novel, because he believes that he will not be able to recover until he learns to ignore it or \"kill it\".\n\nFrey meets many interesting people in the clinic, with whom he forms relationships and who play an important role in his life both during and after his time in the clinic. These people include a mafia boss who plays a vital role in his recovery (subject of Frey's subsequent book \"My Friend Leonard\"), and a woman drug addict with whom he falls in love, despite strict rules forbidding contact between men and women at the clinic. James finally recovers and never relapses.\n\nA notable feature of \"Pieces\" is its lack of quotation marks to indicate direct quotes or dialogue. Instead, a new line is started each time someone speaks. The fact that the author uses this same style to indicate his internal thoughts, often interspersed between direct dialogue from himself and others, gives the book a unique and sometimes confusing writing style, purportedly reflecting the nature of his experience in the treatment center. Frey makes frequent use of this stream of consciousness writing technique, which is intended to allow the reader to better understand his version of the events. Frey's unique writing style also involves his capitalizing nouns throughout the book for unclear reasons. Frey also uses heavy repetition of words throughout the text.\n\nThe book was released on April 15, 2003, by Doubleday Books, a division of Random House, and received mixed feedback. While some critics, such as Pat Conroy, praised the book, calling it \"the \"War and Peace\" of addiction\", others were not as impressed by the gruesome nature of the book and Frey's overall attitude that sets the tone for the book. For example, critic Julian Keeling, a recovering addict, stated that \"Frey's stylistic tactics are irritating...none of this makes the reader feel well-disposed towards him\". Also, author Heather King said that \"\"A Million Little Pieces\" rings false\".\n\nPoet and author John Dolan roundly criticized the book, saying:\n\nHe was also scathing about the writing style, which he described as a \"childish impersonation of the laconic Hemingway style\", and referred to it as a \"novel\" several times.\n\nIn September 2005, the book was picked as an Oprah's Book Club selection, and shortly thereafter became the number one paperback non-fiction book on Amazon.com, and topped the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list for fifteen straight weeks. By January 28, 2006, it had fallen to number four on the Amazon.com list with Winfrey's following selection, \"Night\" by Elie Wiesel, taking over the top position.\n\nThe book garnered international attention in January 2006 after it was reported that it contained fabrications and was not, as originally represented by the author and publisher, a completely factual memoir.\n\nIn October 2017, it was announced that director Sam Taylor-Johnson and actor Aaron Taylor-Johnson were working on a film adaptation of the novel.\n\nAfter a six-week investigation, \"The Smoking Gun\" published an article on January 8, 2006, called \"A Million Little Lies\". The article described fabrications in Frey's account of his drug abuse experiences, life, and criminal record. According to CNN, \"The Smoking Gun\"'s editor, William Bastone, said \"the probe was prompted after the Oprah show aired\". He further stated, \"We initially set off to just find a mug shot of him... It basically set off a chain of events that started with us having a difficult time finding a booking photo of this guy\".\n\nThe Minneapolis \"Star Tribune\" had questioned James Frey's claims as early as 2003. Frey responded, then, by saying, \"I've never denied I've altered small details.\"\n\nStories surfaced about Random House, publisher of \"A Million Little Pieces\", deciding to give full refunds to anyone who had purchased the book directly through it. According to a Gawker.com report, customers could have a claim to money if they truly felt deceived by Frey.\n\nIn an article detailing the book, Frey is quoted saying he \"stands by the book as being the essential truth of my life\". However, on January 26, 2006, Frey once again appeared on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" and this time admitted that the same \"Demons\" that had made him turn to alcohol and drugs had also driven him to fabricate crucial portions of his \"memoir\"; it first having been shopped as being a novel but declined by many, including Random House itself. Winfrey told Frey that she felt \"really duped\" but that, \"more importantly, I feel that you betrayed millions of readers.\" She also apologized for her previous telephoned statement to \"Larry King Live\" — during Frey's appearance on that show on January 11, 2006 — that what mattered was not the truth of Frey's book, but its value as a therapeutic tool for addicts. She said, \"I left the impression that the truth is not important.\" During the show, Winfrey interrogated Frey about everything from the number of root canals he had to the existence of his girlfriend, Lilly. Winfrey then brought out Frey's publisher, Nan Talese, to defend her decision to classify the book as a memoir, and forced Talese to admit that she had done nothing to check the book's veracity, despite the fact that her representatives had assured Winfrey's staff that the book was indeed non-fiction and described it as \"brutally honest\" in a press release.\n\nDavid Carr of the \"New York Times\" wrote, \"Both Mr. Frey and Ms. Talese were snapped in two like dry winter twigs.\" \"Oprah annihilates Frey\", proclaimed Larry King. \"New York Times\" columnist Maureen Dowd wrote, \"It was a huge relief, after our long national slide into untruth and no consequences, into swiftboating and swift bucks, into W.'s delusion and denial, to see the Empress of Empathy icily hold someone accountable for lying\", and the \"Washington Post\"'s Richard Cohen was so impressed by the confrontation that he crowned Winfrey \"Mensch of the Year\".\nAll of Winfrey's reactions, as well as video clips of her interview with Frey, are found within her book club's website.\n\nOn January 13, 2006, Steven Levitt, co-author of the book \"Freakonomics\", stated in his blog that, having searched the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention database of mortality detail records, he was unable to identify a single death that reasonably closely matched Frey's description of the circumstances of the death of \"Lilly\", Frey's alleged girlfriend in the book. Following Frey's admission to Winfrey that he had altered Lilly's method of suicide in the book from cutting her wrists to hanging, on January 27, 2006, Levitt recorded on his blog that he was again unable to find a recorded death consistent with Frey's revised description. As Levitt states,\n\nThe publishers of the book, Doubleday and Anchor Books, initially stood by Frey, but further examination of the evidence eventually caused the publishers to alter their stances. They released a statement noting, \"When the Smoking Gun report appeared, our first response, given that we were still learning the facts of the matter, was to support our author. Since then, we have questioned him about the allegations and have sadly come to the realization that a number of facts have been altered and incidents embellished.\" As a consequence, the publishers decided to include a publisher's note and an author's note from Frey as disclaimers to be included in future publications. According to the source at the company, there had been some disagreement among editors at the publishing house about Mr. Frey’s authenticity, but the early dissenters had been silenced by the book's commercial success, both pre- and post-Oprah.\n\nRandom House issued a statement regarding the controversy. It noted that future editions of the book would contain notes from both the publisher and Frey on the text, as well as prominent notations on the cover and on their website about the additions. On September 12, 2006, Frey and publisher Random House, Inc. reached a tentative legal settlement, where readers who felt that they had been defrauded by Frey's \"A Million Little Pieces\" would be offered a refund. In order to receive the refund, customers must submit a proof of purchase, pieces of the book itself (page 163 from the hard cover or the front cover from the paperback), and complete a sworn statement indicating that they purchased the book under the assumption that it was a memoir.\n\nIn Frey's note to readers, which will be included in future editions of the book, he apologized for fabricating portions of his book and for having made himself seem \"tougher and more daring and more aggressive than in reality I was, or I am.\" He added,\nFrey admitted that he had literary reasons for his fabrications, as well:\nNevertheless, he defended the right of memoirists to draw upon their memories, not simply upon documented facts, in creating their memoirs. Additionally, Frey has discussed the controversy and stated his side of the argument on his blog.\n\nShortly after Frey's return to the Oprah Winfrey show, the Brooklyn Public Library went as far as recataloging Frey's book as fiction, although it appears most other libraries have not followed suit. The \"New York Times\" Best Seller list still includes it on the Paperback Nonfiction List as of September 2006.\n\nRegardless of this controversy, the book has been published in twenty-nine languages worldwide and has sold over 5 million copies. The majority of these sales occurred after Oprah announced it as the new Oprah's Book Club book.\n\nOn January 18, 2006, Marty Angelo, prison minister and author of the book \"Once Life Matters: A New Beginning\", came to the defense of James Frey in a press release. While Angelo did not condone the inclusion of fictional elements in a book marketed as non-fiction, he stated, “The controversy surrounding the recent accusations that Frey embellished some of his statements in his book is relatively minor compared to the fact this man claims he cleared one of the biggest hurdles in his life—his substance abuse. That’s the bottom line issue.”\n\n“Right now the media seems to be negatively attacking the messenger instead of concentrating on promoting the positive message of redemption...” Angelo added. “In terms of the benefit to readers as a self-help book, the message is the key issue, not the minor story details. One needs to stay focused on what the real message is—overcoming addiction.”\n\nOn July 28, 2007, at a literary convention in Texas, Nan Talese spoke of Oprah Winfrey as having been \"mean and self-serving\" and having had a \"holier-than-thou attitude\" and \"fiercely bad manners\" during Winfrey's debate with Talese and James Frey on January 26, 2006. Talese said she and Frey were led to believe the show was going to be a panel discussion on \"Truth in America\". Just before air time, both Talese and Frey were told the topic of the show had been changed to \"The James Frey Controversy\", thus the ambush began. Talese stated that Oprah needed to apologize for her behavior on the show. However Joyce Carol Oates said \"This is an ethical issue which can be debated passionately and with convincing arguments on both sides. In the end, Oprah Winfrey had to defend her own ethical standards of truth on her television program, which was courageous of her.\" Talese was unapologetic about publishing Frey's \"A Million Little Pieces\" and commented the book has great value for anyone who must deal with a loved one who is an addict.\n\nA film version directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson was announced, with Aaron Taylor-Johnson starring.\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to Breillat, \"Anatomy of Hell\" is a \"sequel\" to \"Romance\".\n\nTeetering on the edge of overwhelming ennui, a lonely and dejected woman pays a gay man to join her for a daring, four-day exploration of sexuality in which both reject all convention and smash all boundaries while locked away from society in an isolated estate. Only when the man and woman confront the most unspeakable aspects of their sexuality will they have a pure understanding of how the sexes view one another.\n\n\nThe film was adapted by writer/director Breillat from her novel \"Pornocracy\". The sexually explicit film stars Amira Casar as \"the woman\" and porn star Rocco Siffredi as \"the man\". Leonard Maltin summarizes: \"After attempting suicide in the bathroom of a gay disco, a woman hires the man who rescues her to spend four nights in her company, challenging him to 'watch me where I'm unwatchable'.\"\n\nThe film polarized critics. Leonard Maltin gave the film zero stars and said the film was \"homophobic\" and \"unintentionally funny\". Roger Ebert stated: \"I remember when hard-core first became commonplace, and there were discussions about what it would be like if a serious director ever made a porn movie. The answer, judging by \"Anatomy of Hell\", is that the audience would decide they did not require such a serious director after all.\"\n\nBBC film critic Jamie Russell gave the film four stars out of five:\n\nThe film went on to win \"Best Feature Film\" at the Philadelphia Film Festival.\n\nReview aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports a 26% rating based on 35 critics with an average rating of 3.6/10. The site's consensus states: \"Ponderous, pretentious, and -- considering the subject matter -- dull.\" On Metacritic, the film has a 29 out of 100 rating based on 19 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".\n\n"}
{"id": "22630874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22630874", "title": "Andreas Papadakis", "text": "Andreas Papadakis\n\nAndreas Constantine Papadakis FLS (17 June 1938 – 10 June 2008) was a Cypriot-born British academic, entrepreneur and leading figure in the field of architectural publishing. He opened the Academy Bookshop in Holland Street, Kensington in 1964 and moved into publishing as Academy Editions in 1968. From then until 1990, when he sold the company to VCH Germany (now part of John Wiley) he published more than a thousand titles mainly on art, architecture and the decorative arts. He was the first to publish (in USA - Rizzoli 'and latter St. Martin's Press) many international architects in the 'Architectural Monographs No...' series, which included Alvar Aalto (No 4), Michael Graves (No 5), Edwin Lutyens (No 6), John Soane (No 8), Terry Farrell (No 9), Richard Rogers (No 10), Mies van der Rohe (No 11), Hassan Fathy (No 13), Tadao Ando (No 14), Daniel Libeskind (No 16), etc.; and Victor Arwas’s \"Art Deco\", first published in 1980 remains the standard work on the subject.\n\nPapadakis was born in Nicosia, Cyprus on 17 June 1938 and relocated to London in 1956. He obtained a DIC from Imperial College and a PhD from Brunel University. In 1964 he bought a house in Holland Street, Kensington without realising that the shop (then a dry cleaners) on the ground floor could not be used for residential purposes. He decided to open a bookshop. The Academy Bookshop began as a general bookshop. His first publications were finely bound limited editions of other publishers’ books but he soon decided that he would prefer to make his own and began in 1967 with a large format paperback of Aubrey Beardsley’s prints, an ideal title to attract the customers of Biba, who had recently opened her shop just round the corner in Kensington Church Street. The Beardsley book was still in print when Academy was sold in 1990.\n\nIn 1971 Papadakis expanded his fast-growing business with the acquisition of the Tiranti publishing company and the London Art Bookshop. He moved the shop to No. 8 Holland Street, just opposite the Academy Bookshop and set about expanding the combined Academy/Tiranti list. Early publications included Jim Burns’s \"Arthropods\", Roger Bilcliffe’s \"Charles Rennie Mackintosh\", Rudofsky’s \"Architecture without Architects\", Reyner Banham’s \"Design by Choice\", \"Alphonse Mucha, Complete Graphic Works\", and Wittkower’s \"Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism\".\n\nIn 1975 Papadakis bought the financially troubled \"Architectural Design\" magazine. This created some controversy because of his non-architectural background and his unwillingness to give his unconditional support to one particular architectural style. The controversy increased with the publication of Charles Jencks’s \"The Language of Post-Modern Architecture\" in 1977, which was in its sixth edition by the time he sold Academy in 1990.\n\nBoth \"Architectural Design\" and Academy Editions continued to publish Post-Modern, Classical and Deconstructivist projects throughout the 1980s while Papadakis himself actively fostered the pluralist debate through seminars, conferences and exhibitions at the Polytechnic of Central London, the Architectural Association, the RIBA, the German Architecture Museum in Frankfurt, and through his Academy Forums at the Tate Gallery and the Royal Academy of Arts, where he also founded the annual Architecture Lecture.\n\nIn 1990, Papadakis sold what was by now the Academy Group Ltd. with \"Architectural Design\" and the journals he had founded: \"Architectural Monographs\", \"Art and Design\" and the \"Journal of Philosophy and the Visual Arts\". He left the group at the end of 1992 and was banned by a non-competition clause from publishing for five years.\n\nIn 1997, Papadakis founded a new publishing house, Papadakis Publisher, with his daughter Alexandra. In addition to books on architecture and the decorative arts the company broadened its scope to include books on natural science, including the acclaimed series \"Pollen\", \"Seeds\" and \"Fruit\" in association with the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, leading to his election as a Fellow of the Linnean Society. \"Pollen\" and \"Seeds\" were awarded a joint gold medal by the American Independent Publishers’ Association in 2006 as Outstanding Books of the Year, and his first science book \"Why the Lion Grew its Mane\" was long-listed by the Royal Society in 2007.\n\nAs Papadakis’s business ventures were increasingly successful, he purchased several properties for restoration, including the medieval Kilbees Farm in Winkfield, Berkshire and Dauntsey Park House in Wiltshire, although the latter project ended in 2005 when planning permission was refused. \nIn 1987 Papadakis bought Church Island in the Thames and commissioned Dr. Basil Al Bayati, an architect whose books 'Architect' and 'Recent Works' he had published, to design a house for him.\n“For his luxury mansion on his Greek-island-in-the-Thames, the great man chose not Michael Graves, one of the deconstructivists or even CZWG, but pragmatic classicist Basil Al Bayati, whom he instructed to design a country house in the English turn-of-the-century manner.” The plan of the house is based on multiple units of structural geometrical forms and utilises extensive brickwork in a postmodern, art & craft style. It was “designed in a vernacular manner, using building materials similar to those traditionally used in the area.”\n\nIn 1988, Church Island House was exhibited at the German Architecture Museum in Frankfurt in an exhibition titled The Architecture of Pluralism that included work by James Gowan, Terry Farrell, Charles Jencks and some twenty other internationally recognised architects.\n\nIn 2007 he purchased Monkey Island Hotel in Bray, Berkshire but died a few months afterwards.\n\n"}
{"id": "49169838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49169838", "title": "Anna Frijters", "text": "Anna Frijters\n\nAnna Frijters (\"nee\" Velders) (1889–1966) was a Belgian screenwriter, producer, director and author, known for two silent films \"Leentje van de zee\" (1928) and \"De verloofde uit Canada\" (1934) which she wrote, produced and directed with her husband François Frijters in the late 1920s. She was also known as one of the early female screenwriters, who played an important role in pioneering the development of scriptwriting in the Belgium film industry.\n\nBefore beginning their filmmaking careers, Anna and François Frijters were both diamond cutters in Antwerp and passionate about making their own films. Moving to the United States, they met with Ruth Roland, an American actress who starred in a number of silent films. Ruth Roland encouraged Anna Frijters to enter a screenplay competition arranged by Brewster Publications, where she won the second prize for her screenplay called Leentje van de zee (Peggy of the Sea). Her victory in this competition created largely critical receptions. Jule Selbo pointed out that Motion Picture Magazine, described her entry as \"puny\", and showed its reaction as follows:\n\nThis success also paved the way for a wide range of offers coming from studios in the United States. She rejected all these offers because she wanted to follow her own path and pursue her filmmaking career with her husband François Frijters. At the same time, she did not want the American studios to influence her vision.\n\nWith the help of their friends, the couple built a studio called Little Roland Studio in a suburb of Antwerp, where they planned to film \"Leentje van de zee\" (\"Peggy of the Sea\") The film tells the story of a young girl who survived a shipwreck and was adopted by a fisherman. The fisherman was later accused of murdering a young boy who tried to seduce the girl.\n\nAnna and François Frijters sold their house in order to make an investment for the film. The filming began in 1926 in St. Anneke, De Panne and inside the Liberty movie theatre. Victor Beng and Antoine Laureys assisted Frijters behind the camera. At Roland's request, Max Factor, who was the make-up artist in the film, came from Hollywood and joined the production. However, the couple went through some rough times completing the film. Due to budgetary problems and limited production facilities in the studio, the crew and cast consisted of amateurs who were only able complete the shooting outside of working hours. In addition, the filming was also postponed several times due to some other drawn-out problems such as the storm that damaged the building and the pregnancy of the lead actress Ive Bramé. The production, as a result, lasted two years and had its premiere in the cinema of Antwerp zoo in 1928.\n\nAnna Frijters decided to make the distribution on her own as she was rejected by the film distributors in Brussels. Her efforts of distributing the film yielded results to a certain extent, having her film released by only sub-run theaters in Belgium. She used patriotic slogans as a way of advertising her film and gaining the support of locals.\n\nThe final result did not meet Frijters' expectations due to the arrival of sound film that overshadowed the film's public interest as well as the mainly negative reviews written about the film itself. In September 1929, Close Up magazine shared a small review that intended to disgrace the content of the film.\n\nFrijters was discouraged from maintaining her interest in filmmaking after the critical and commercial backlash of Leentje van de Zee, though her husband, François Frijters, made a Newsreel film called Inhuldiging van het standbeeld van Guido Gezelle (Inauguration of the Statue of Guido Gezelle) in 1930. However, Frijters wrote a short comedy screenplay called \"De verloofde uit Canada (The Fiancé from Canada)\", which revolved around a working-class man who returned home from Canada and discovered that his fiancée Betty no longer loved him and was married to someone else. The main character was played by a comedian, Lowieke Staal.\n\nFilming began throughout 1929 and 1930 in various locations of Belgium such as the World's Fair in Borsbeek and the warehouse at the Keyserlei, which is known as a prominent boulevard in Antwerp. However, the production process of the film was also problematic, due to the choice of amateur actors in the cast and their inflexible availabilities, which caused disagreements and replacements among the crew members. In addition, the post-production process lasted four years because of the lack of budget, causing the film to have its test screening in 1934.\n\nAs compared to the failure of her 1928 film, this film was given a green light to be scored by J. Antoon Zwijsen as a result of its successful test screening. However, the process was interrupted by a massive fire that destroyed the entire studio. Only the Zwijsen's musical score survived but the fire permanently marked the end of the Frijters' filmmaking career. Throughout history, De verloofde uit Canada was remembered as a creative experiment with its combination of animated and conventional images.\n\nIt was later discovered that the only son of the Frijters family, Roland, kept the copies of both films in his basement. These copies were later restored for their premiere at the Flanders International Film Festival in Gent in October 1986, with the participation of the cast of Leentje van de Zee\".\"\n"}

Art movements were especially important in modern art, when each consecutive movement was considered as a new avant-garde.\n\nAccording to theories associated with modernism and the concept of postmodernism, art movements are especially important during the period of time corresponding to modern art. The period of time called \"modern art\" is posited to have changed approximately halfway through the 20th century and art made afterward is generally called contemporary art. Postmodernism in visual art begins and functions as a parallel to late modernism and refers to that period after the \"modern\" period called contemporary art. The postmodern period began during late modernism (which is a contemporary continuation of modernism), and according to some theorists postmodernism ended in the 21st century. During the period of time corresponding to \"modern art\" each consecutive movement was often considered a new avant-garde.\n\nAlso during the period of time referred to as \"modern art\" each movement was seen corresponding to a somewhat grandiose rethinking of all that came before it, concerning the visual arts. Generally there was a commonality of visual style linking the works and artists included in an art movement. Verbal expression and explanation of movements has come from the artists themselves, sometimes in the form of an art manifesto, and sometimes from art critics and others who may explain their understanding of the meaning of the new art then being produced.\n\nIn the visual arts, many artists, theorists, art critics, art collectors, art dealers and others mindful of the unbroken continuation of modernism and the continuation of modern art even into the contemporary era, ascribe to and welcome new philosophies of art as they appear. Postmodernist theorists posit that the idea of art movements are no longer as applicable, or no longer as discernible, as the notion of art movements had been before the postmodern era. There are many theorists however who doubt as to whether or not such an era was actually a fact; or just a passing fad.\n\nThe term refers to tendencies in visual art, novel ideas and architecture, and sometimes literature. In music it is more common to speak about genres and styles instead. See also cultural movement, a term with a broader connotation.\n\nAs the names of many art movements use the -ism suffix (for example cubism and futurism), they are sometimes referred to as \"isms\".\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1881, it offers activities of interest to amateur photographers, particularly digital photography. It meets weekly and is open to the public.\n\nPhotography was introduced to the public in 1839. For some decades, practice was limited largely to professionals because it involved laborious wet-plate processes. Amateur photography in the United States received major impetus in 1880, when the future Eastman Kodak Co., and others, introduced dry plates—glass plates with chemical emulsion already applied. In 1888 Kodak introduced the first flexible roll photographic medium—first paper and soon film—and third-party processing. These innovations brought photography to the masses. Still, photography practiced in camera cubs (and among professionals as well) typically used glass plates until the early 20th century, when film was finally accepted. During the chemistry-based era, third-party processing and printing were typically prohibited in camera clubs, except later in the 20th century for color photographs.\n\nThe club known today as the Boston Camera Club was founded October 7, 1881 in Boston, Massachusetts as the Boston Society of Amateur Photographers. It is the second-oldest camera club continuously extant in the United States founded at least in part by amateurs.\n\nThe club was founded by F. H. Blair, James M. Codman, W. C. Greenough, A. P. Howard, Lucius L. Hubbard, Frederick Ober, and John H. Thurston, with Thurston having the most influential role. At first temporary officers were elected. The seven men were joined on November 18, 1881 by James F. Babcock, William T. Brigham, Wilfred A. French, and William A. Hovey, at which time permanent officers were elected—Brigham president, Babcock vice president, and French secretary and treasurer. At first the club met in the offices of the Boston \"Sunday Budget.\" Later it met at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, at the time located in Boston.\n\nAs amateur photography in the United States became more widespread, in 1886 the club changed its name to Boston Camera Club. On April 6, 1887 it incorporated in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts under the new name, stating as its purpose the furthering of \"the knowledge of photography in all its branches and the promotion of social intercourse among the amateur photographers of Boston and vicinity.\"\n\nIn 1886 the Boston Camera Club rented permanent headquarters at 50 Bromfield Street, Boston. It may have been selected by being the place of business of both club founder John H. Thurston and early vice president Charles Henry Currier. The club had eight rooms:\n\nAt 50 Bromfield the club held public exhibitions of photography featuring works by its members and guest photographers.\n\nFor reasons begging further research, in 1913 difficulties arose. Minutes of that year by longtime club secretary John H. Thurston show membership in the club had fallen off, and the club's uncertain future was under discussion. Thenceforth business, but apparently far fewer regular, meetings were held. The club was kept alive, at least administratively, by Frank Roy Fraprie (FRAY-pree), Phineas Hubbard (president 1908–1913 and possibly longer), Horace A. Latimer, and the aging Thurston. The club, it is believed in 1924, left its longstanding 50 Bromfield Street location, and for some years it met at the Boston Young Men's Christian Union (YMCU). Amateur photography in Boston now seems to have been dominated by the Boston YMCU Camera Club (a different entity than Boston Camera Club's meetings at YMCU), extant from 1908 to at least the 1920s; Boston Photo-Clan, extant by 1912 but apparently defunct by about 1921, dominated by Boston professional photographer John H. Garo at whose studio it met; and the Boston Arts and Crafts Society.\n\nIn 1931 a bequest by longtime club member Horace A. Latimer (1860–1931) of Boston, an independently wealthy amateur photographer of some renown, for reasons not fully understood as well, profoundly reinvigorated the Boston Camera Club. Membership rebounded, for example reaching 286 in 1946. With the funds the club would purchase new headquarters. First, however, it moved to 330 Newbury Street, in the Back Bay section of Boston.\n\nIn 1934, with part of Horace Latimer's bequest the Boston Camera Club purchased a building at nearby 351A Newbury Street, Back Bay. The club occupied three floors. There were a large and small exhibition gallery, darkroom, library and kitchen. Public exhibitions of photography resumed. For tax purposes, in 1946 the club decided to sell no. 351A and remain in the building as a lessee. Growth continued apace, reaching 555 in 1959—492 regular, 51 associate and 4 honorary members—a level maintained for some two decades. Besides post-war prosperity, the growth is attributable to introduction of 35mm film by Kodak in the 1930s, and single lens reflex (SLR) 35mm cameras by Nikon, Pentax and others in the 1960s. Enthusiasts often sought instruction in their camera use by joining a camera club.\n\nIn 1980 the 351A Newbury Street building was sold and the Boston Camera Club moved from Boston to the adjacent town of Brookline, Mass. In 1997 it moved across town to its current location in Brookline.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s membership again declined dramatically, a trend attributable to a number of factors including camera automation, for example autofocus and programmed exposure reducing the need for user instruction; the advent of consumer video; and changing social habits. Since 2000 membership has increased again to about 150 today, due in large part to the club's emphasis on digital photography.\n\nThe exhibition history of the Boston Camera Club is long and somewhat complex. The club has hosted several species of shows: exhibitions by its members, joint shows with other camera clubs, exhibitions by outside photographers and camera clubs, and \"salons\"—judged competitive exhibitions of photography open to the international public.\n\nAbout 1883 the Boston Society of Amateur Photographers, as the club was first known, held its first exhibition at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, an unusually large show of some 700 photographic prints. The third exhibition in 1885 included male nudes, raising eyebrows in conservative Boston. In 1892 the club exhibited in the long-running triennial exhibition of the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association. In the club's seventh and tenth member exhibitions, in 1895 and 1898, member Emma D. Sewall received the top award. In the 1898 show Sarah Jane Eddy, and painter and Photo-Secession member Sarah Choate Sears, was prominent. In 1900 the Boston Camera Club held an exhibition by member Fred Holland Day. In 1904 it exhibited its members' work at Day's studio in Boston. The same year the club helped organize, and exhibited in, a photograph exhibition at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, the St. Louis World's Fair. The club's annual show of 1910, which photographic journal \"Photo-Era\" called the club's \"best for many years,\" had prints by Eddy, Frank R. Fraprie, Horace A. Latimer, and Joseph Prince Loud. The 1910 exhibition is the last known to be held by the club until 1932, when it launched the Boston Salon.\n\nDuring this period, the Joint Exhibitions of Photography were held, sponsored jointly by the Boston Camera Club, Photographic Society of Philadelphia, and Society of Amateur Photographers of New York. The venue rotated annually among the three cities. The Boston club participated in the first seven exhibitions, from 1887 to 1894. At first all three clubs shared in the preparation for each show. In the first Joint Exhibition, held in New York City in 1887, Joseph Prince Loud and Horace A. Latimer received the Boston club's only diplomas. In the third Joint Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1889, Boston was represented by Wilfred A. French; Horace Latimer, the club's only award winner; and William Garrison Reed. Starting with the fourth Joint Exhibition in New York City in 1891, collaborative preparation ended and each club individually ran the exhibition in the city in which it was held. In the 1891 exhibition Latimer exhibited the most prints from the Boston club. The fifth Joint Exhibition, held at the Boston Art Club in 1892, included 18 prints by Alfred Stieglitz (1864–1946) and 45 prints by Boston Camera Club member and Bell telephone pioneer Francis Blake, Jr. (1850–1913). Of the sixth Joint Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1893, Stieglitz said, \"It was, without doubt, the finest exhibition of photographs ever held in the United States, and probably was but once excelled in any country.\" After the seventh exhibition in 1894, the Boston Camera Club withdrew from the Joint Exhibitions, citing lack of manpower.\n\nThe Boston Camera Club had two series of photography salons, or competitive exhibitions. The first series was held in the first decade of the 20th century, probably for only a few years. Presently only the second salon, held in 1906, has been identified.\n\nAs part of its revival by Horace Latimer's 1931 bequest, in 1932 the club launched a new international competition, the Boston Salon of Photography, held almost annually for the better part of the next five decades. In 1953 it was renamed the Boston International Exhibition of Photography, although informally often still called the Boston Salon. In 1953 as well, the Frank R. Fraprie Memorial Medal was created in recognition of Fraprie's role, along with Horace Latimer, in having kept the club alive in the problem years of 1913–1930.\n\nHeretofore Boston Camera Club competitions were limited to black-and-white prints. Starting in 1954 color slides were accepted in the Boston International Exhibition. From 1959 color prints were admitted. The 43rd and last exhibition was held in 1981, the club's centenary year. In discontinuing the international exhibitions, again the club cited lack of manpower. Whereas earlier salons typically received hundreds of entries each, the 1981 exhibition required a man-year of labor to process a total of almost 3,300 prints and slides.\n\nNoted entrants in the Boston Salon and International Exhibition over the years included A. Aubrey Bodine (1906–1960), who began competing by 1944 and won the Fraprie medal in 1953, 1955 and 1959; Eleanor Parke Custis who was competing by the 9th Salon in 1940; Croatian photographer Tošo Dabac, the 1937 medal winner; Hong Kong-American photography prodigy, actor and director Ho Fan (Fan Ho) (b. 1937) who first competed in 1954 at age 17; 1940s pictorialist Rowena Fruth (1896–1983), competing by 1944; lifelong amateur photographer, future United States Senator and Presidential candidate Barry Goldwater (1909–1998) who submitted a print in 1940; Wellington Lee who competed 1950–1981; and Mexican cinema director José Lorenzo Zakany Almada who won the Boston Camera Club Medal in 1968. Exhibition judges included Cecil B. Atwater (1886–1981); Bodine; Leonard Craske; Custis; John W. Doscher (d. after 1971); Adolf Fassbender; etcher Arthur William Heintzelman (1891–1965), first keeper of prints at Boston Public Library; Franklin I. Jordan; L. Whitney Standish; John H. Vondell (d. circa 1967); and Henry F. Weisenburger.\n\nFrom the late 19th to at least the mid-20th century, the Boston Camera Club had exhibitions by prominent outside photographers. About 1890 it exhibited the work of English photographic pioneer Henry Peach Robinson (1830–1901). In 1896 the club showed work by Alfred Stieglitz, later founder of the Photo-Secession. Also in 1906, it exhibited 150 photographs by Gertrude Käsebier (1852–1934). In 1899 the club showed work by Frances Benjamin Johnston (1864–1952). That year it also exhibited the work of Clarence White (1871–1925), organized and hung by Fred Holland Day. About this time the club exhibited work by Rudolph Dührkoop (1848–1918). There were other exhibitions by lesser-known photographers.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries U.S. camera clubs mounted exhibitions of each other's work. For example, in 1908 the Boston club exhibited works from the Buffalo (New York), Capitol (Washington DC), and Portland (Maine) Camera Clubs.\n\nIn 1940 the Boston Camera Club exhibited the work of Edward Weston (1886–1958). In 1950 it showed work by Paul Gittings, Sr. In 1953 it exhibited photographs from 1843–1848 of Scottish pioneers David Octavius Hill (1802–1870) and Robert Adamson (1821–1848) (Hill and Adamson).\n\nAfter the Boston Camera Club's revival in 1931, it moved temporarily to 330 Newbury Street, Boston. It is unknown whether this space had an exhibition room. The club's permanent facility at 351A Newbury Street, purchased in 1934, had a large gallery. Public exhibitions of outsiders' work in this period were mentioned; member shows have not been identified. Since 1980 when the club left no. 351A, it has had no gallery space, all member shows being held at other venues in the Boston area. The Boston Camera Club has had exhibitions at Boston City Hall in 1993, Griffin Museum of Photography, 1997, Boston's Hynes Convention Center, 2004, art and photo studios, and camera stores in the Boston area.\n\nIn discharging the mandate of its 1887 state charter to promulgate \"the knowledge of photography,\" for most of its existence the Boston Camera Club has sponsored lectures, courses and programs by expert members and guests. In 1890 member Francis Blake, Jr. read to the club an important paper on camera shutters, in which he did pioneering work. In 1895 member Owen A. Eames presented his Eames Animatoscope, an early motion picture device (although one source said: \"It is unlikely that projection was attempted.\") In 1897 Friedrich von Voigtländer, head of the Austrian optical firm of that surname, spoke to the club. In 1904 Fred Holland Day presented a paper for which he was well known, \"Is Photography a Fine Art?\" There were many other lecturers in the club's early years.\n\nRecords identifying guest speakers for much of the 20th century have not been studied. In the 1970s and 1980s the Boston Camera Club had presentations by Marie Cosindas and Minor White. In the 1990s it sponsored day-long courses by Lou Jones, Frans Lanting, John Sexton, and others. Boston-area professionals such as staff photographers of \"The Boston Globe\" and \"The Boston Herald\", and instructors in Boston's photography colleges, have long been regular club presenters and competition judges. Since the latter 1990s the Boston Camera Club regularly has lectures and field trips in digital photography.\n\nAbout 1888 a group of photographers, possibly William Garrison Reed and other members of the Boston Camera Club, undertook the Old Boston project, a \"survey of buildings and farms for local archives,\" whose photographs, owned by the Boston Public Library, were rediscovered in 2007.\n\nDuring the 1890s members of the club pursued stereoscopy. Lantern slides, the forerunner of 20th-century color slides, were popular as well. In the 1940s the club undertook \"entertainment and instruction of disabled veterans of World War II ... sponsor[ing] a camera club at one of the large Army convalescent hospitals nearby.\" In the 1950s and 1960s the club had a movie group and owned a Bell & Howell movie projector.\n\nBecause the club was founded before amateur photography was widespread, many early members were more advanced practitioners, a handful even making modest advances in photo technology. Even after more consumer-friendly processes came online in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, some club members continued to attract notice. Starting no later than the early 1890s, the Boston Camera Club has awarded honorary life membership on two classes of deserving individuals: its own members having given extraordinary service to the club, and outside personalities in the Boston area for signal photographic achievement.\n\nAmong the founders of the Boston Society of Amateur Photographers, as the Boston Camera Club was known until 1886, some were noted locally, even nationally. First permanent vice president of the club James F. Babcock (1844–1897) was a well-known Boston chemist and science lecturer who held several U.S. patents. First permanent secretary and treasurer Wilfred A. French, son of daguerreotypist Benjamin French, was a Boston photographer and photo supplier, later editor and publisher of \"Photo-Era: The American Journal of Photography,\" one of the leading journals in the field, and a founding member of a group called the National Historic Picture Guild. Club co-founder John H. Thurston, whose business was in the same building as the club at 50 Bromfield Street, was a Boston photographic supplier as well. Early vice president Charles Henry Currier (1851–1938) was a Boston jeweler and commercial photographer also based at 50 Bromfield.\n\nProminent in the early club were Emma J. Fitz, Maine photographic pioneer Emma D. Sewall (1836–1919), and painter Sarah Jane Eddy (1851–1945). Boston-area electric car manufacturer George Edward Cabot (1861–1946), an honorary member, was president of the club in 1886–1890. Another early honorary member was late-19th century traveling lecturer Antonie Stölle, who presented innovative color slide-illustrated lectures on artworks.\n\nThe Boston Camera Club counted two astronomers among its members, Percival Lowell (1855–1916) and honorary member William Henry Pickering (1858–1938), the latter an astrophotographer who discovered Saturn's moon Phoebe, worked on faster shutters for nighttime work, and furthered the cause of women in astronomy.\n\nPainter, photographer, Boston arts patron and club member Sarah Choate Sears (1858–1935) was named a \"Member\" of the Photo-Secession by Alfred Stieglitz. In 1899 she had a solo exhibition at the club that included a portrait of Julia Ward Howe. The same year she showed in the second Boston Arts and Crafts Exhibition.\n\nTwo collaborators of Alexander Graham Bell were honorary members of the Boston Camera Club. One is the club's earliest (1892) known honorary member, Prof. Charles \"Charlie\" Robert Cross (1848–1921), believed to have taught the first electrical engineering course in the United States, at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1882–1883. The other was inventor and club vice president Francis Blake, Jr. (1850–1913), believed to have substantially helped the club financially in its early years. Blake's 1877 microphone was critical to Bell's telephone technology; as a camera shutter pioneer he achieved speeds of 1/2,000 second by 1890.\n\nIn 1896 a photographic print by Horace A. Latimer was shown in an exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution. Latimer is the only known Boston Camera Club member published in \"Camera Notes,\" the official publication of The Camera Club of New York, of which he was a member as well. The wealthy amateur Boston photographer whose 1931 bequest revived the fortunes of the Boston Camera Club, Latimer is the club's best-remembered early member today. Among his interests were yachting photography and international travel photography.\n\nBoston photographer, publisher, esthete and Boston Camera Club member Fred Holland Day (1864–1933), associated for a while with the Photo-Secession, judged at least one exhibition at the Boston Camera Club, in 1906.\n\nIn the early 20th century three members of the Boston Camera Club were well-known photographic authors and publishers. Wilfred A. French was mentioned. The prolific Frank Roy Fraprie (1874–1951) was head of American Photographic Publishing Co. and editor of annuals \"The American Amateur Photographer\" and \"American Annual of Photography.\" Honorary member Franklin Ingalls \"Pop\" Jordan (1876–1956) was a photographic author and editor. Another personality, Adolf \"Papa\" Fassbender (1884–1980), the German-born New York City-based educator called a \"one-man photographic institution,\" had a career of 72 years training thousands in photography. Another noted photographer was Lillian Baynes Griffin, an \"associate,\" or corresponding, member of the club, who joined in 1906.\n\nThe Boston Camera Club had members who were non-photographic artists of note practicing photography secondarily. They included Gloucester Fisherman's Memorial sculptor Leonard Craske (KRASK) (1882–1950); honorary member and prolific Cape Ann, Massachusetts artist, photographer and author Samuel V. Chamberlain (1895–1975) who wrote at least 45 photograph-illustrated travel books; painter Emil Albert Gruppé (1896–1978); and post-Secessionist photographer and watercolorist Eleanor Parke Custis (1897–1983).\n\nAmateur photographer, photographic author and publisher, and honorary club member Arthur Hammond (1880–1962) won top prize from organizers of the 1939 New York World's Fair for his photo of the fair's icons, the Trylon and Perisphere. Architect, amateur photographer, author and honorary member L. Whitney \"Whit\" Standish (1919–?) was an influential member of the club who helped organize its weekly meetings, competitions, educational courses, and newsletter.\n\nOne of the most well-known figures in 20th century photography, U.S. National Medal of Science (1973) recipient, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, and Boston Camera Club honorary member Harold Eugene \"Doc\" Edgerton (1903–1990) greatly advanced the photographic strobe, achieving exposure times of one-millionth of a second, and took the well-known \"Life\" magazine photographs of a bullet penetrating an apple and an impact crown of milk droplets. Lesser known are his night aerial strobe work for the Allied D-Day invasion in World War II, co-founding defense contractor EG&G, and undersea explorations with Jacques Cousteau.\n\nAt least five persons named Boston Camera Club honorary members in the 1970s–2000s had achievements of note. H. Bradford Washburn, Jr. (1910–2007) was a mountaineer, cartographer, aerial photographer, and longtime first director of the Boston Museum of Science. Photojournalist Arthur Leo Griffin (1903–2001) was the best-known photographer of New England scenes in the mid-20th century. Aeronautical engineer Henry F. Weisenburger (b. 1924), who has practiced photography since the 1940s and who joined the club in 1954, is arguably the longest-active living exponent of amateur photography in New England, having instructed many in the field. In 1959 Leslie A. Campbell was founder of Massachusetts Camera Naturalists. Lou Jones (b. 1945) is a Boston-based commercial, Olympic Games and jazz photographer; photojournalist whose books include \"Final Exposure: Portraits from Death Row\" (1996); and photography educator.\n\nBoston Camera Club members have been honored by outside organizations. Telephone pioneer Francis Blake, Jr. (1881), astronomers William Henry Pickering (1883) and Percival Lowell (1892), and strobe pioneer Harold Eugene Edgerton (1956) were Fellows of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences. Cecil B. Atwater, Eleanor Parke Custis, John W. Doscher, Adolf Fassbender, Rowena Fruth, Barbara Green, Arthur Hammond, Franklin I. Jordan, Charles B. Phelps, Jr. (1891–1949), L. Whitney Standish, John H. Vondell, Edmund A. Woodle (1918–2007), and Richard Yee have been Fellows of the Photographic Society of America (FPSA); Frank R. Fraprie and Allen G. Stimson (d. 1996) were Honorary Fellows (HonPSA); many other club members have been Associates (APSA). Atwater, Doscher, Fassbender, Green, Hammond, Jordan, and Yee have been Fellows of the Royal Photographic Society (FRPS) of Great Britain, Fraprie Honorary Fellow. Roydon (Roy) Burke (1901–1993) was, and Henry F. Weisenburger is, a Master Member of the New England Camera Club Council (MNEC). Professional photographers Arthur Griffin and Lou Jones have belonged to the American Society of Media Photographers (Griffin charter member, Jones board of directors).\n\nThe U.S. Library of Congress has major holdings of the work of at least two Boston Camera Club members. \"Photographs of Middle Class Life in Boston, 1890s–1910s\" is a collection of 523 photographs by Charles Henry Currier. The Library also holds the largest number of photographs of Fred Holland Day. There are substantial institutional holdings of the photographs of Francis Blake, Jr.; Eleanor Parke Custis; Harold E. Edgerton; Adolf Fassbender; Arthur Griffin by his Griffin Museum of Photography; Emil Albert Gruppé; Sarah Choate Sears by Harvard University; L. Whitney Standish; H. Bradford Washburn; Henry F. Weisenburger by University of Florida, Gainesville; and others.\n\nAs it has for most of its existence, the Boston Camera Club meets weekly. Meetings are held at 1773 Beacon Street, Brookline, Massachusetts every Tuesday evening from September to June. Guests are welcome.\n\nThe club's primary emphasis is on digital photography. Activities range from beginner to advanced and comprise education, print competitions and critique, a live-model portrait studio, field trips, and inter-club competitions. Outside speakers and competition judges are regularly invited. The club communicates through its website and newsletter, \"The Reflector,\" launched in 1938 and now published electronically.\n\nThe Boston Camera Club, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit educational corporation registered in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is a member of New England Camera Club Council (NECCC) and Photographic Society of America (PSA).\n\nEarly records of the Boston Camera Club, from 1881 to 1942, are held by the Boston Athenaeum and are available to researchers by appointment.\n\n\n\"BCC\" denotes \"Boston Camera Club\":\n\n\"BCC\" denotes \"Boston Camera Club\":\n\n\n\n\n\nIn chronological order:\n\n"}
{"id": "44049754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44049754", "title": "Charles Sherman (artist)", "text": "Charles Sherman (artist)\n\nCharles Sherman (born 1947) is an American artist best known for his continuum sculptures based on a three-dimensional form of the Möbius strip. Sherman’s work is included in museum and public collections, such as the San Diego Museum of Art, the Mobile Museum of Art, and the Golda Meir Center for Political Leadership at Metropolitan State University of Denver. His work has been shown in solo and group exhibitions in the United States and Asia. His sculpture and jewelry designs have appeared in contemporary design and architectural publications. \"Serenity\" (2006), part of his monumental ceramic \"Infinity Ring\" body of work, is installed lakeside at the \"Fountain Park Sculpture Garden\" in Fountain Hills, Arizona, and also in the front of the \"John Entenza House\" in Santa Monica, California, a precursor to the Case Study Houses.\n\nSherman’s early-career paintings, drawings, and prints were of flowers. He closely observed and recorded their transformation from life to death. He characterized this exploration as a gateway to his \"Goddess Series\". \n\nIn the 1980s, Sherman was a significant artistic interpreter of the Goddess movement that had begun worldwide in the 1970s. Sherman embraced the feminine energy of the goddess as a powerful force, and created a visual language that was inspired by the work of Los Angeles-based Lithuanian archaeologist Marija Gimbutas. Sherman's depictions of goddesses from the Neolithic period and the traditions of ancient Europe were described by Starr Goode as abstracted, fanciful images which sometimes verged on the grotesque. Her interview of Charles Sherman was one of 21 interviews of scholars and artists by Starr Goode for her cable series, \"The Goddess in Art\" (1986-1991). The videos are in the permanent collection of the Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles, California. \nSherman exhibited his predominantly black and white acrylic paintings in goddess-themed Los Angeles exhibitions, such as \"The Goddess in Contemporary Art\" exhibition of 1988, curated by Nancy Ann Jones at the Social and Public Art Resource Center in Venice, California. His paintings have been published in books about the goddess including \"The Once and Future Goddess\" by Elinor Gadon, and as cover art for several print editions of the poetry journal \"Sheela-Na-Gig\" (now online).Sherman also gave gallery talks, and in 1993, a painting workshop, \"The Animal Goddesses of Old Europe\", at the Craft and Folk Art Museum. Decades later, Jungian archetypes of the feminine are still present in Sherman's oeuvre, but in forms emphasizing beauty, reduced to the Minimalism art form of the Möbius.\n\nSherman has also used performance art as a vehicle to express strongly held viewpoints and make political statements. During his 1989 tenure as president of the Los Angeles Artists' Equity Association, Sherman assisted artist Tom Van Sant with his \"Goddess of Democracy\" project in downtown Los Angeles. The 1000-pound statue was built by Van Sant and members of the Los Angeles Chapter of the Artists' Equity Association in support of the pro-democracy uprising by students in Beijing during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Beijing artists had built a monumental \"Goddess of Democracy\" statue that had been destroyed by Chinese troops who stopped the rebellion with what became a bloody massacre. The Los Angeles \"Goddess of Democracy\" suffered a similar fate; vandals toppled the statue at its Chinatown location.\n\nIn 1990, Sherman collaborated with feminist artist Cheri Gaulke in front of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art for \"Who’s Burning America?\" As a criticism of the U.S. government subsidy of tobacco, Sherman designed a large-scale billboard showing the American flag with a cigarette burning a hole through it. He displayed the billboard on the side of a truck parked in front of the museum, while Gaulke, dressed as Senator Jesse Helms, a strong supporter of the tobacco industry, set an American flag on fire with a giant cigarette.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Sherman began work on a series of bronze sculptures, drawings and prints, to give visual interpretation to the “…complexity and deep humanity of biblical characters.” His study of the Old Testament Bible resulted in a personal, mystical visualization of a rich biblical past and our developing mythology. He expressed his interpretation of the Bible not only through art, but also by lectures at art galleries and Jewish temples. His \"Kabbalah Mandala\" motif first appeared in 1993 as an illustration in the book \"God, Sex and Kabbalah\" by Rabbi Allen S. Maller.\n\nIn the introduction to his catalogue, “The Bible Series” (1998), Sherman wrote that he intended this body of work to deal with “…issues of gender, spirit, and the Divine.” His bronze sculpture \"The Two Faces of Eve\" (1996) depicts a nude Eve embraced by and gazing into the eyes of a female-faced serpent, a mirror image of herself. The subjects of his bronze sculptures from this period range from the depiction of traditional Bible stories, such as his wall sculpture \"Jacob and Esau Wrestling in the Womb\" (1996), to the contemporary subject of \"The Warrior\" (1994), an homage to Deena Metzger, writer, teacher, counselor, and breast cancer survivor. \nThe end of the century would find Sherman creating \"Golda\" (1999), a monumental bronze portrait head of Israeli teacher and fourth Prime Minister of Israel, Golda Meir. The sculpture would be installed in the new millennium at the Golda Meir Center for Political Leadership at the Metropolitan State University of Denver. Sherman was invited to give a lecture at the center.\n\nAlong with his figurative work, Sherman had been concurrently creating abstract and organic sculpture, and in 2002 began investigating circular forms he called \"Infinity Rings\", based on a three-dimensional form of the Möbius strip. This new body of work was a technical challenge; he first had to find a way to build monumental sculptures from clay that would withstand the tendency to collapse during high temperature kiln firing. He has continued to explore the infinity ring form in diverse materials, and also combined rings to create multiple ring sculptures.\n\nSherman began to incise words into his clay infinity ring sculptures, philosophical manifestos such as, \"God is a Verb\", \"Art is a Verb\", and \"Love is a Verb\", or verse fragments from the Bible, such as “I am to my Beloved as my Beloved is Mine” in either English or Hebrew. Sherman’s ceramic infinity ring sculpture, \"God is a Verb\" was in the 2007 \"Dead Sea Scrolls\" exhibition at the San Diego Natural History Museum.\nSherman has created infinity rings from various media, including bronze, stainless steel, Lucite, aluminum, and glass mosaic, but prefers the mobility of clay. \"If I could make one statement about art, it’s that the essence of art is that \"it's a verb, not a noun.\" It´s a process, and when you fully understand that, you let the art take its own course. Even clay has a life of its own and knows where it wants to go and I try to facilitate that.\"\nSherman has written that it is his intention to express universal spiritual values with his sculpture. This emphasis on spirituality is especially a feature of Sherman’s later work in symbolic jewelry design. Sherman’s jewelry designs are sculptures in miniature of his larger works. He has said that these designs are based upon “sacred geometry.” Some are symbols from world religions, such as Christianity, Judaism, and Hinduism. Sherman has received numerous awards for his sculpture, including First Place at the 1989 Los Angeles All City Art Open, juried by Henry Hopkins and Merry Norris. He was awarded First Place in Inspirational Design in an international design competition, the 2012 JCK Jeweler’s Choice Awards for his Trinity Cross pendant, and in 2014, the Jewelers of America association selected Sherman as one of ten new jewelry designers to debut their collections at the professional organization’s \"JA New York Summer Show\".\n"}

It was the first resident Chicago opera company. The company also spent several months each year performing in the city of Philadelphia where it performed at the Philadelphia Metropolitan Opera House under the name the Philadelphia-Chicago Grand Opera Company in order to \"satisfy the civic pride\" of that city. The company notably presented the world premieres of Victor Herbert's \"Natoma\" (1911) and Attilio Parelli's \"I dispettosi amanti\" (1912). The company also mounted the United States premieres of Jean Nouguès's \"Quo vadis\" (1911), Karl Goldmark's \"Das Heimchen am Herd\" (1912), and Alberto Franchetti's \"Cristoforo Colombo\" (1913). Notable performers who sang with the company included Paul Althouse, Marguerite Bériza, Alfredo Costa, Armand Crabbé, Charles Dalmorès, Enrica Clay Dillon, Jenny Dufau, Hector Dufranne, Minnie Egener, Amy Evans, Mary Garden, Jeanne Gerville-Réache, Orville Harrold, Gustave Huberdeau, Frances Ingram, Lydia Lipkowska, Vanni Marcoux, Carmen Melis, Lucien Muratore, Giovanni Polese, Albert Reiss, Myrna Sharlow, Tarquinia Tarquini, Luisa Tetrazzini, Alice Zeppilli, and Nicola Zerola among others.\n\nThe second Chicago Grand Opera Company was an attempt to keep opera going in Chicago after the collapse of the Chicago Civic Opera in 1932.

{"id": "1013749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1013749", "title": "Comprachicos", "text": "Comprachicos\n\nComprachicos (also Comprapequeños and Cheylas) is a compound Spanish neologism meaning \"child-buyers\", which was coined by Victor Hugo in his novel \"The Man Who Laughs\". It refers to various groups in folklore who were said to change the physical appearance of human beings by manipulating growing children, in a similar way to the horticultural method of bonsai – that is, deliberate mutilation. The most common methods said to be used in this practice included stunting children's growth by physical restraint, muzzling their faces to deform them, slitting their eyes, dislocating their joints, and malforming their bones. The resulting dwarfed and deformed adults made their living as mountebanks or were sold to lords and ladies to be used as pages or court fools.\n\nVictor Hugo's novel \"The Man Who Laughs\" is the story of a young aristocrat kidnapped and disfigured by his captors to display a permanent malicious grin. At the opening of the book, Hugo provides a description of the Comprachicos:\n\nThe Comprachicos worked on man as the Chinese work on trees. A sort of fantastic stunted thing left their hands; it was ridiculous and wonderful. They could touch up a little being with such skill that its father could not have recognized it. Sometimes they left the spine straight and remade the face. Children destined for tumblers had their joints dislocated in a masterly manner; thus gymnasts were made. Not only did the Comprachicos take away his face from the child; they also took away his memory. At least, they took away all they could of it; the child had no consciousness of the mutilation to which he had been subjected. Of burnings by sulphur and incisions by the iron he remembered nothing. The Comprachicos deadened the little patient by means of a stupefying powder which was thought to be magical and which suppressed all pain.\n\nAccording to research by John Boynton Kaiser in the Journal of the American Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology, \"Victor\nHugo has given us a pretty faithful picture of many characteristic details of social England of the 17th century; but the word Comprachicos is used to describe a people whose characteristics are an unhistorical conglomeration of much that was once actual but then obsolete in the history of human society.\" Much that seems unimaginable today may have authentic roots in common practices of the seventeenth century.\n\nOne of the common creations of the Comprachicos was supposed to be artificial dwarfs, formed \"by anointing babies' spines with the grease of bats, moles and dormice\" and using drugs such as \"dwarf elder, knotgrass, and daisy juice\". The conception was known to Shakespeare, as Beatrice K. Otto pointed out, quoting \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\":Get you gone, dwarf;<br>You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made;\n\nOther means of creating this result were conjectured to include physical stunting by breaking or dislocating bones, and forcible constraint, whereby growth was inhibited for a long enough period to create permanent deformation. Because of the demand for dwarfs and other novelties in the courts of kings at this time, this could have been a profitable occupation.\n\nThe term \"comprachico\" is very uncommonly used in modern English except in reference or allusion to the antiquated folklore , but similar stories do exist in the English speaking world. For instance, a tale circulating since at least the 1980s tells of a Japanese bride who disappears during her honeymoon in Europe; years later her husband discovers she has been abducted, mutilated, and forced to work in a freak show.\n\n\"Comprachico\" has been adopted as a pejorative term used for individuals and entities who manipulate the minds and attitudes of children in a way that will permanently distort their beliefs or worldview. Twentieth-century philosopher Ayn Rand referred to educators of the time as \"the Comprachicos of the mind\" in her article \"The Comprachicos\". Her criticism was targeted especially toward educational progressivists, but also grade-school and high-school educators who, in her view, used psychologically harmful methods of education.\n\nIn the 2010 album \"Immersion\" by Australian Drum and Bass band Pendulum, one of the songs was named \"Comprachicos\", where the lyrics had references to manipulation and restraint.\n\nThe 2011 DC comic Batman and Robin #26 contained a villain whose father disfigured him after reading about the \"Comprachicos\" in Hugo's novel.\n\nJames Ellroy refers to them and Victor Hugo's novel in \"The Black Dahlia\" which forms a major motivation for the murder of Elizabeth Short.\n\n"}
{"id": "13963594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13963594", "title": "Cultural materialism (cultural studies)", "text": "Cultural materialism (cultural studies)\n\nCultural materialism in literary theory and cultural studies traces its origin to the work of the left-wing literary critic Raymond Williams. Cultural materialism makes analysis based in critical theory, in the tradition of the Frankfurt School. \n\nCultural materialism emerged as a theoretical movement in the early 1980s along with new historicism, an American approach to early modern literature, with which it shares much common ground. The term was coined by Williams, who used it to describe a theoretical blending of leftist culturalism and Marxist analysis. Cultural materialists deal with specific historical documents and attempt to analyze and recreate the zeitgeist of a particular moment in history. \n\nWilliams viewed culture as a \"productive process\", part of the means of production, and cultural materialism often identifies what he called \"residual\", \"emergent\" and \"oppositional\" cultural elements. Following in the tradition of Herbert Marcuse, Antonio Gramsci and others, cultural materialists extend the class-based analysis of traditional Marxism (Neo-Marxism) by means of an additional focus on the marginalized.\n\nCultural materialists analyze the processes by which hegemonic forces in society appropriate canonical and historically important texts, such as Shakespeare and Austen, and utilize them in an attempt to validate or inscribe certain values on the cultural imaginary. Jonathan Dollimore and Alan Sinfield, authors of \"Political Shakespeare\", have had considerable influence in the development of this movement and their book is considered to be a seminal text. They have identified four defining characteristics of cultural materialism as a theoretical device:\n\nCultural materialists seek to draw attention to the processes being employed by contemporary power structures, such as the church, the state or the academy, to disseminate ideology. To do this they explore a text’s historical context and its political implications, and then through close textual analysis note the dominant hegemonic position. They identify possibilities for the rejection and/or subversion of that position. British critic Graham Holderness defines cultural materialism as a \"politicized form of historiography\".\n\nThrough its insistence on the importance of an engagement with issues of gender, sexuality, race and class, cultural materialism has had a significant impact on the field of literary studies, especially in Britain. Cultural materialists have found the area of Renaissance studies particularly receptive to this type of analysis. Traditional humanist readings often eschewed consideration of the oppressed and marginalized in textual readings, whereas cultural materialists routinely consider such groups in their engagement with literary texts, thus opening new avenues of approach to issues of representation in the field of literary criticism.\n\n"}
{"id": "1117970", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1117970", "title": "Doom paintings", "text": "Doom paintings\n\nA \"Doom painting\" or \"Doom\" is a traditional English term for a wall-painting of the Last Judgment in a medieval church. This is the moment in Christian eschatology when Christ judges souls to send them to either Heaven or Hell. \n\nThe subject was very commonly painted on a large scale on the western wall of churches, so it was viewed as people left the church, and the term is typically used of these, rather than depictions of the \"Last Judgement\" in other locations or media. Many examples survive as wall-paintings in medieval churches, most dating from around the 12th to 13th centuries, although the subject was common from the 1st millennium until (in countries remaining Catholic) the Counter-Reformation. Most dooms in English churches were destroyed by government authority during the English Reformation.\n\nThe most famous of all Doom paintings, \"The Last Judgment\" by Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel, painted in 1537 to 1541, comes at the end of the tradition, and is unusually sited on the east wall behind the altar.\n\nDoom or \"the Doom\" was a specific term for the Last Judgement and first cited to c. 1200 by the OED (\"doom\", 6), a sense surviving in this artistic meaning and in phrases such as the \"crack of doom\" and the word \"doomsday\", the latter going back to Old English. The original OED in the late 19th century already described this sense of \"doom\" as \"archaic\", but it remains in use in descriptions of (mostly) British medieval churches. \n\nDooms were encouraged by the early medieval Church as an instrument to highlight the contrasts between the reward of Heaven and the agony of Hell so as to guide Christians away from misbehaviour and sin. A Doom was usually positioned either on the rear (liturgical Western) wall, if that space was available, or at the front (Chancel end) of a church, often on the Chancel arch itself so that it would be constantly visible to worshippers as they faced the altar during services.\n\nAlthough there are many different versions, the composition stays broadly the same. On the left side of a Doom painting (that is, on Christ's right hand) is Heaven, whilst on the right (Christ's left) is Hell. At the top of the image Jesus Christ sits in glory with his (proper - i.e. on the left to the viewer) right hand encouraging the saved up and his left hand pointing down to Hell for the damned. Typically flanking him is the Virgin Mary on his right and John the Apostle on his left, sometimes with the twenty-four elders mentioned in the Book of Revelation encircling the three of them. The angels blow trumpets to raise the dead for judgment. Commonly the Archangel Michael is in the centre, with the scales he will use to weigh the souls of humanity to see if individually they are fit for Heaven: one person is on one side of the scale while demonic creatures that represent the sins committed by the person are on the other side of the scale. The creatures try to tip the scales in their favour while, in some versions of the painting, the Virgin Mary places a rosary next to the person she wishes to protect, or puts her hand on the scale to counterbalance the demons. In some other versions, while one of the saved enters Heaven, a demon tries to pull them in with the damned, while an angel fights the demon for the soul.\n\nThose who are worthy are brought to the gates of Heaven, frequently represented by a castle with large walls built to keep out sinful impurities. This is most commonly depicted on the left hand side of Doom paintings. Groups of angels adorn the walls of Heaven celebrating the saved as they approach Heaven's gates, where Saint Peter waits with his keys.\n\nThose on the other side are deemed unworthy of Heaven, usually seized by demons and brought into the Hellmouth, beyond which, mostly out of sight, lie the bowels of hell.\n\nA decisive factor in the Doom or Last Judgement will be the question, if the corporal works of mercy were practiced or not during lifetime. They rate as important acts of charity. Therefore, and according to the biblical sources (Mt 5:31-46), the conjunction of the Last Judgement and the works of mercy is very frequent in the pictorial tradition of Christian art.\n\nAt Chaldon in Surrey the west wall of the church has a painting of the Ladder of Salvation (a subject common in the Eastern Church but this is the only example in England). This painting dates from about 1200 and is 17.5 ft long and 11.21 ft high. The church of Saints Peter and Paul, Chaldon, (built before 1086 AD) contains a large wall painting of around 1170 depicting images of the ways of salvation and damnation and their result \n\n"}

Schumacher & Co. is a privately held company based in New York City and Newark, Delaware, that designs products for the interior design industry in the United States. Established in 1889 by Frederic Schumacher, F. Schumacher & Co. is a fifth generation business and the only supplier of decorative textiles from the 19th century still privately owned and managed by direct descendants of its founder. The company sells fabrics, wall coverings, trimmings, furnishings, and floor coverings under two brands, Schumacher & Patterson, and Flynn & Martin. F. Schumacher & Co. currently maintains 18 showrooms in several countries and sells to the interior design trade.\n\nFrederic Schumacher came to New York with the French textile company Passavant & Co. In the same year, he opened F. Schumacher & Co. at 22nd Street and Broadway on Manhattan's Ladies' Mile (now the Ladies' Mile Historic District). With the Gilded Age in full swing by 1893, Schumacher became a textile supplier and sold decorative fabrics to new American mansions and hotels, including the Waldorf-Astoria and the Vanderbilt.\n\nIn 1895, the company purchased a domestic fabric manufacturing facility, the Waverly Mill in Paterson, New Jersey. The factory later helped with the production of parachutes and other military equipment during the World Wars.\n\nIn 1925, Schumacher took part in the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris, an exhibition of Modern Art, a movement which inspired styles such as Art Nouveau and Art Deco. According to Jeffrey Simpson, who wrote in Architectural Digest in 2008, it is most likely that just before 1930 Pierre Pozier, nephew and heir of Frederic Schumacher, brought Poiret into the company as its first fashion luminary. At that time Poiret was asked to create the first designer fabric collection for the company. Poiret came up with simple Modernist shapes for his fabrics inspired by his contemporaries, Cubist painters.\n\nBy 1939, during the Great Depression and Second World War, the company contributed to the war effort by producing material for parachutes, life preserves, and other wartime products for the navy and air force. From 1939 until 1946, Schumacher's New Jersey-based mill, Waverly, operated 24 hours a day.\n\nWith rise in suburban communities and the American housewife, Waverly (a division of Schumacher, which was sold in 2007) marketed directly to the department store consumer and began advertising in print media in 1944 with the first slogan \"all three,\" allowing customers to purchase fabric, wallpaper and carpeting in one place. \nIn 1951, a custom-designed Liberty Bell and Liberty Cap were woven at the Schumacher mill for both the United States Senate and the House of Representatives. In 1950, First Lady Bess Truman selected fabric from F. Schumacher & Co. designed by Vera Neumann ) to decorate the White House's third-floor Solarium windows and upholstery.\n\nCurrently F. Schumacher & Co designs, manufactures, and is a supplier of decorative fabrics for residences and other interiors. They sell luxury textiles to the contract market. They specialize in historic reproductions, oriental rugs, exclusive designs by Wilton, and rugs which are tufted by hand. They also design handmade rugs. They sell exclusively to interior designers utilizing a network of sales people and showrooms located throughout the world.\n\nIn 1990 the company opened a distribution center in Richburg, South Carolina. In 2014 the company moved to a smaller facility in Fort Mill, SC to better accommodate a work force of 40 while still being a convenient distance to the Charlotte-Douglas International Airport.\n\nThe company is planning to move its headquarters in New York from 79 Madison Avenue between East 28th and East 29th streets to 875 Avenue of the Americas at West 31st street. The move is planned for the summer of 2015.\n\nSet designer Hobe Erwin designed a line for Schumacher that was used to decorate the set for \"Gone With The Wind\" (1939). Cecil Beaton, society photographer and fashion designer for stage and screen — \"My Fair Lady\" and \"Gigi\" — was enlisted as a guest designer for F. Schumacher. In addition, sets for \"A Bed Time Story\" (1933), \"I Love Lucy\" (1953), \"The Age of Innocence\" (1993), \"Washington Square\" (1996), \"Atonement\" (2007) and others included Schumacher in their designs.\n\nThe company has supplied textiles to the White House, the Chambers of the United States Supreme Court, and the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nF.

{"id": "43824631", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43824631", "title": "Family folklore", "text": "Family folklore\n\nFamily folklore is the branch of folkloristics concerned with the study and use of folklore and traditional culture transmitted within a family group. This includes items of material culture, crafts produced by family members or memorabilia saved as reminders or remainders of significant family events. It also includes family photos and photo albums in paper and electronic format, along with bundles of other pages held for posterity: certificates, letters, journals, notes and shopping lists. Family stories and sayings, originally recounting actual events, are told and retold until the historical facts give way to a distilled expression of common identity. Family customs are performed, modified, forgotten, created or resurrected with alarming frequency; each time with the goal of defining and solidifying the perception of this family as unique, distinct and different from other families.\n\nFamily folklore has long been included in the documentation of the folklore of regional, ethnic, religious or occupational groups. It is only since the 1970s that this lore has also been investigated as a defining element of the family group itself. Heralded by a call from Mody Boatright to document the \"family saga\" in 1958, folklorists responded with published accounts of stories and traditions passed down in their own families. L. Karen Baldwin’s unpublished dissertation (1975) laid further theoretical groundwork for family folklore \"… not only is the family a folk group, it is the first folk group anyone belongs to.\"\n\nThe field has since blossomed, broadening to include an ever expanding understanding of family. The conventional extended family, consisting of a heterosexual married couple with children and grandparents now incorporates gay partners, unmarried committed relationships and children adopted or born through non-traditional methods and procedures. The family traditions themselves are transformed to meet the needs and expectations of these new members and new relationships. \n\nThe study of family folklore is distinct from family genealogy or family history. Instead of focusing on historical dates, locations and verifiable events, its unique stories, customs and handicrafts identify the family as a distinct social group. At the same time, the family lore passed along has been molded and transformed to relay a sense of family identity and set of values both within and without the family group. The family lore defines the family story. \nFor an individual family, folklore is its creative expression of a common past. As raw experiences are transformed into family stories, expression, and photos, they are codified in forms which can easily be recalled, retold, and enjoyed. Their drama and beauty are heightened, and the family’s past becomes accessible as it is reshaped according to its needs and desires. … Its stories, photographs, and traditions are personalized and often creative distillations of experience, worked and reworked over time. \n\nA new baby is born or a child is adopted into an established family group, which contains a microcosm of social alignments found in many larger groups: the vertical relationship between grandparents and grandchildren, the horizontal relationship between siblings and cousins of a generation or age group, clusters of girls or boys and skill-based family alliances. The child grows up in this family, sees and learns the family lore as it is performed throughout the seasons and the life cycle. Not only is the family the first folk group of the child, it is \"the group in which important primary folkloric socialization takes place and individual aesthetic preference patterns for folkloric exchange are set.\"\n\nThe dynamics of family folklore remain unsettled not only through the addition of newborns and adoptions, but more particularly by the regular incorporation of new adult family members through each marriage or committed relationship. In the formation of each new family node, a unique subset and combination of the customs and traditions of both families is incorporated into a new story, both modifying and enriching the current family lore. \n\nAs part of the ongoing national discussion of \"family\" and what it means, family folklore redefines itself as well. Along with the classic family \"father-mother-child(ren)\", it expands to include single-parent families, blended families, communes, gay and lesbian families. The indicator for family now includes any group which self-identifies as a family based on intimacy, shared space and shared history. Any collection of adults and children in a committed relationship which sees itself as \"us\", unique and separate from other families, will develop and transmit stories and customs which are unique. Non-traditional families frequently strive to re-establish and re-enact traditional family customs and lore. This becomes a demonstration both to themselves and to outsiders that they are indeed a family of \"tradition\".\n\nThe transmission of individual stories and customs within a family depends for the most part upon the personality, character, and lifestyle of individual family members. It is not normally passed along as part of a defined family role. As a family reshapes itself around each birth, death, marriage and other life events, individual members elect to pick up items of family lore to own and perform. This might be learning a skill, telling a story (or story cycle) or baking a traditional pie for the Thanksgiving table. The transmission of individual items can picked up by several different family members, for example when several grown siblings use a family recipe or tradition in their own households. This type of transmission through multiple individuals was first described in an article by Dégh and Vázsonyi as \"multi-conduit transmission\". By choosing to own a piece of the family lore, a family member signifies that this tradition embodies beliefs and values to which he adheres. By successfully transmitting it further within the family, these beliefs and values come to define the family. \n\nThere are multiple spheres within the family and household which are \"traditionally\" defined as in the purview of one gender or the other, making an intersection with gender studies manifest. The transmission of the folklore in these areas will run through either the male or the female lines. An obvious area of gender-related transmission is seen in the kitchen, where food preparation and mealtime customs and forms are generally performed by the women. They are then transmitted from mother to daughter in the course of everyday meal preparation. A variant of this is seen when a man in the family has taken over the preparation of a special meal or special recipe. One common example of this practice is described by Thomas Adler in the article \"Making Pancakes on Sunday: The Male Cook in Family Tradition\". Many families have some variation of this tradition: the BBQ ribs, grilled hamburgers, or deep-fat fried turkey prepared as a single specialty by the non-cook in the family.\n\nA different gender-related variation in folklore transmission is seen in storytelling. The same story will be shaped and told differently by a man and a woman, even though they were both present at the original event. For an event occurring during the apple harvest, a woman’s narration might include details of the apple butter recipe they were cooking up at the time. In contrast, the man's narration gives only enough detail to \"make a point worth telling\". This gender-based variance has been studied by both Baldwin and Margaret Yocum within individual family groups. They found \"… women's telling to be more collaborative, interruptible, and filled with information and genealogy; men's telling, by contrast, is often uninterrupted and more competitive.\"\n\nWithin families, there is also a notable tendency toward traditional deference where one family member becomes the designated performer for a specific custom or tradition, even though it is known to everyone within the family group. So it happens that when the \"last basketmaker\" dies, another member will step up to become \"the last basketmaker\". No one else performs this tradition as long as the designated tradition bearer is available, acknowledging this individual as the (current) keeper of this tradition. Only when this person is no longer available will the tradition be picked up by someone else to carry forward. \"Traditional deference\" can be found in many folk groups, but is particularly evident within the family group.\n\nIf the family lore which is picked up and transmitted represents the chosen familial beliefs and values, then family stories, documents and photographs which do not support and enhance these values become problematic. For the most part news clipping on arrests, photographs of the uncle who deserted the family, stories of a sister who cheated, or dishonorable discharge papers will not be saved. That is not the family story this family wants to preserve. \n\nFamily traditions are also lost or modified in response to difficult events within the family. This is obvious when one of the tradition bearers has died. If no one else steps up to own that tradition, a hole is left in the celebration and this tradition is lost. In a divorce there is also frequently the loss of a parent no longer available to play his or her role in the established traditions. In response to this event, one family decided to change the traditions. The customary tall Christmas tree decorated by the (missing) tall father was traded in for a short tree which the children could decorate. Ornaments were discarded and new ones purchased. The toy train was no longer set up. These became the new traditions for the Christmas celebration, modified to support and tell the new family story. \n\nAnother reason family folklore might be suppressed or lost is when the references are too painful at the present time or to the present generation. When Catherine Noren found photo albums and other old family portraits in her grandmother’s attic, she unwittingly unearthed an entire family history of a prosperous German-Jewish family before the Holocaust. It became her task, one generation removed, to explore and record the family history in a book containing photos, diaries and memories of her family history. It is only because these albums and portraits had not been discarded along with the narrative that Noren came to know her family story.\n\nIt is only since the 1970s that family folklore has been investigated as a defining element of the family group itself. As part of this investigation, the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C. set up a tent for several years to collect the family lore of visitors to the Festival. The goal was to establish an archive of family folklore as part of the Smithsonian collections. Using the taped interviews collected, representative pieces have been published in the book \"A Celebration of American Family Folklore: Tales and Traditions from the Smithsonian Collection\". Despite its lack of performance data, this collection provides a solid overview of the wide range of family folklore forms. \n\nA family story initially recounts an actual historical event concerning named family members. Seasoned with time and re-telling, the story gets revised and honed to express specific values and character traits valued in the family. Instead of historical accuracies, the narration becomes a medium to re-state and re-enforce shared values of the family group. These stories generally take the form of an anecdote and follow the pattern of many common traditional tales. A favorite family story involves how the parents met, or how they decided on the one true partner among several. In one family, if the story is to be believed, the prospective bride had to untie all the knots in the string to demonstrate her care and diligence. Another family tells how the young couple got stuck at the top of a Ferris wheel when he proposed, and she had to either say yes or jump. Given time and repetition, the anecdotes serve to shape the family story as a whole, populating it with real individuals and historical events made personal. In their transmission, these stories serve to codify the norms of behavior within the family.\n\nThe setting for telling family stories becomes part of the tradition. It can include the family occasions where stories are told, the location and prompt for the storytelling, the family members who initiate the session as well as the designated raconteurs and custodians of the stories. Each of these elements needs to be documented along with the stories themselves as an integral part of the storytelling tradition within this family. In one family following the holiday meal, the men would retire to the study and the women would move into the kitchen. At some point in the cleanup, usually after the best dishes had been washed and put away, the mother would bring out a bottle of schnapps to help complete the work. This became the trigger for family stories and jokes, the laughter from the kitchen frequently bringing the men to join in the storytelling.\n\nAnother type of verbal lore common within family groups is the unique family expression or saying. A saying can be created at any time; it starts as a one-time utterance of a family member to capture a single moment. Through repetition, this then becomes a shorthand reference to both the original and the current situation. In one family, the saying \"… good worker, very strong\" signifies that the speaker wants to come along, and would in fact be a value-add to the planned undertaking. This expression originally referenced a first move of the family, a move that current family members took no part in. Even so, the saying has become code words for all family members, used to communicate encrypted commentary on the present as well as re-enforce and strengthen the family’s shared experience and history.\n\nPapers stacked, bundled or boxed: news clippings, photographs, letters, scrawled notes, journals, receipts. These pages of family artifacts take many forms, and have become a significant part of family archival materials. Frequently jumbled together in cardboard boxes, they commonly pose a problem as to their value-add to the family story. The boxes are passed along until they are either thrown out in a move, destroyed in a fire, or find an owner within the family, someone with the interest and time to house and evaluate them. \n\nThe largest collection of papers is frequently the photographs, either kept in a drawer or labeled and organized into albums. Singly each photo documents only a single moment; taken together they comprise an important visual history of the family. Either way, they serve as triggers for more extensive memories, stories and events in the life of this family. They are brought out at gatherings and used to commemorate lifetime events such as a wedding or funeral. \n\nNoteworthy is the consistency in which American families of all ethnic backgrounds tend to have photographs of the same milestones. Naked babies on carpets or in the wading pool, the first day of school, the birthday cake surrounded by family and guests, generational portraits gathered around the new baby can be found in many family albums. This pictorial repetition by American families of all backgrounds and traditions documents the universality of family photography as an important custom. \n\nAs with storytelling, the occasion for photo-taking becomes a family tradition in and of itself. Year after year, the same pictures are snapped; documenting a family which is growing and changing, adding and subtracting members, detailing a new location. The camera can be as much a part of the celebration as the birthday cake or the menorah. \n\nThe ubiquity of cameras and on-line photos since the rise of cellphone cameras and personal websites is actively changing the tradition of family photos and photo albums. The availability of video recordings and teleconferencing allows for a daily log of family growth and minutiae to be saved and transmitted to family near and far, in real time. Grandparents can get a daily or weekly update on children's growth or milestone events. Family members can video-conference with each other, making geographic distance much less significant in family relations. A new family custom, using the technology of today, is to put together a slideshow or video documenting the story leading up to the current celebration. At this time a folklorist can only speculate on evolving customs of family photography. \n\nSome families have also amassed over decades a collection of letters and other papers written by or about family members. One family, in sorting through boxes of papers, discovered all diplomas for family members from 2nd grade Sunday School up through doctoral degrees. Other family documents include the family Bible, military enlistment or discharge papers and Certificates of Baptism. While certificates authenticate the dates and events in the family history, letters and journals are particularly revealing as to the character and thoughts of individual family members. \n\nSimilar to photographs, letters and journal entries document a single day in the life of a family member. Once these papers have been saved, it falls to members of the following generations to evaluate them. Are they to be preserved as part of the family story or discarded as inconsequential or even damaging to the family? For the most part unfavorable documents are discarded; that is not the family story this family wants to save.\n\nThe introduction of emails, IMs and other electronic messaging means that paper documents of family history are no longer regularly generated. Seldom is electronic communication printed out for the family files. The 19th and 20th centuries, providing access both to widespread literacy and to resources to create and preserve paper documents might mean that these forms of family history and lore are themselves becoming history.\n\nEach family has its own traditions, played out year after year, event after event. These traditions are frequently so engrained that the recognition of them as unique to this family only occurs when compared to other families. This is also an area of family folklore that is most exposed to change or modification. With each additional marriage or committed relationship, a new member from a different family gets added, an individual who does not recognize the family customs as \"traditional\". These new members bring their own traditions which need to be reconciled, perhaps added or even substituted into the current performance. Not only through marriage, but births and deaths also add a fluid dynamic to the family traditions. When the first grandchild is born, everyone moves into a new role, Mom becomes Grandmom, Brother becomes Uncle, and the family Benjamin loses his position to the new baby. These factors lead to a dynamic development of new and renewed family traditions. \n\nOne major and understudied area of family traditions is found in foodways, which includes everything involved in the procurement, preparation, serving and eating of daily meals at home. Most of us go home each evening for dinner, wake up for breakfast and pack up a lunch or snack pack to take with us for the day. All the assumptions about how this occurs, who does what when arise only when the established process (i.e. family custom) hits a snag: we've run out of milk or someone ate the last of the cookies. Maybe Dad is off on a trip and can't make the Sunday morning pancakes. Each of these food customs is understood and accepted by the group as a whole, and followed as a matter of course with little or no discussion. \n\nIt is also customary that family mealtimes differ: breakfast food differs from supper and snacks, weekends frequently vary from the weekday diet. In one busy family a scoop of ice cream on the breakfast cereal turned the meal into an easy, fun supper. There might also be a traditional Sunday Dinner to be prepared and staged weekly with an expanded family group gathered around the table. \n\nHolidays and \"life event\" celebrations, from birthdays to wakes include multiple family customs, either superimposed upon the more broadly defined societal celebrations, or substituting for them. This is seen most obviously in traditions found in the preparation and \"performance\" of a holiday meal. Each family has their own unique traditions, from special dishes prepared only for this dinner, to a single individual who prepares and presents this single dish, to the individual assigned to carve the bird. It is unnecessary to mention examples of this; each North American reader is mentally reviewing the Thanksgiving traditions unique to his own family. This list of special holiday traditions in the family expands easily from the dining table to the family wake-up calls to the distribution of presents under the Christmas tree or Hanukah lights. Each of these, along with countless other details, distinguish this family as a unique social unit. \n\nAnother significant family tradition is that of naming customs. When a new baby is born, incorporating family names into the name for the new baby, or conversely not using family names for the next generation, can become problematic. What rules should be followed? Many ethnic groups have their own naming customs, variations of which might be found within the separate family groups of the parents. There are also differing ethnic customs of who has the authority to pick the name for the baby. When published lists of currently popular names along with expectations of individual family members are added to this mix, it can become a challenge to craft a name which pleases everyone. \n\nAll possessions are considered pieces of material culture - objects with which members of a culture customarily surround themselves. However, only handicrafts produced by family members and memorabilia passed along through generations are of interest in family folklore. \n\nMemorabilia are singular objects which are passed down through the family with the stories and memories about events or individuals attached to them. In one family a doll, given once as a Christmas present, continued to be brought out each year to celebrate Christmas and have her picture taken with the (changing) family. For her hundredth birthday, a birthday cake for the doll was included in the Christmas celebration. Like the doll, almost any object imbued with family stories and memories can become a family heirloom. As such, it holds in the family a value often unrelated to its monetary value. As the stories and memories enveloping the object are slowly lost, the object itself becomes a simple hand-me-down, usually in poor condition and ready to be discarded.\n\nHandicrafts are objects which have been \"homemade\", crafted individually using simple tools by one or more family members. The production skills for these artisanal crafts are generally transmitted within the family; the items might include weaving, welding, pottery, woodworking, quilting, basketry, cooking. They can be used functionally or as decoration in the home. Over time these handicrafts becomes a skill nurtured within the family, as well as a point of family identification for outsiders. The family cultivates both the production knowledge and the objects themselves. \n\nOne aspect of these objects, both family memorabilia and handicrafts, is that they are for the most part one-of-a-kind. Many family members can tell the story of the Christmas doll, or have the family photographs, but only one family branch can actually possess the doll. For handicrafts, a craftsman could decide to create a quilt or a rocking chair for each child in a family. But this just postpones the decision of ownership of the item to the following generation. \n\nEach of these material objects carries along with its stories or memories the ability for family members to experience simultaneity in the home. \"…by gathering around ourselves treasured objects from different times of our lives and our histories, we experience different eras at the same moment and in some way bring the totality of the past to bear upon the present.\" The family history and identity is preserved and transmitted, both for the family member who walks past the bowl sitting on the counter, and the outsider who asks about the origin of the unique item. \"The artifacts that family members make, use, or display can be an unseen backdrop to the duties and demands of family life. Alternatively, they might be carefully crafted statements about the values and expectations of family tradition bearers.\" The candy bowl on the coffee table or the silver tea service set out in the dining room speak of an elegance of hospitality which is customary in this family. \n\n1967 marked the first Smithsonian Folklife Festival, set up on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. to exhibit and demonstrate crafts and customs of diverse ethnic, regional and occupational groups. Originally including only displays from the United States, it later expanded to include traditions and customs from around the world. Each exhibit at the festival endeavors to move beyond the items of tangible culture, the arts and objects we can touch, feel and put in a glass case. Each unique performance or display at the Folklife Festival articulates the goal of the Smithsonian Institution to spread its reach beyond material objects to artifacts of intangible cultural heritage. Festival exhibits such as \"The Changing Soundscape in Indian Country\" (1992), \"American Social Dance\" (1993), \"Mississippi Delta\" (1997), \"Asian Pacific Americans: Local Lives, Global Ties\" (2010) are just a few of the exhibits included since the Festival began. Any of these cultural intangibles, including traditions of performance, ritual, music, dance, traditional knowledge, storytelling or oral transmission, is considered for inclusion at the festival. Its intention is to \"legitimize and celebrate individual Americans and their traditions\". Open to the public at no cost, the festival is devised to enable each visitor to find at least one exhibit which relates to his background, narrates a segment of his story.\nIn 1974 a new tent was added to the Festival. Instead of displaying or performing recognized traditions, its goal was to collect items of family folklore from visitors. This tent was unique at the festival in asking visitors to be active contributors to the folklife on display instead of merely receptive spectators. A sign at the tent was hopeful: \"Family Folklore – Will You Share Yours With Us?\" Card tables with checkered table clothes were set up, tape recorders and folklore interviewers on hand to prompt, listen and record family lore which visitors might share. Not only should each visitor see himself somewhere in the exhibits, but he should also recognize and record parts of his own story as a unique and valued artifact of cultural heritage. \n\nDuring the four years that the tent was included at the festival, it gradually cluttered with objects, memorabilia and photos just like any family home. Taking the taped interviews as a baseline, the stories and customs collected in the tent were used to establish an archive of family folklore as part of the Smithsonian collections. Representative pieces were then published in the book \"A Celebration of American Family Folklore: Tales and Traditions from the Smithsonian Collection\". This collection continues to be supported by the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage and the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. \n\nSince this first Smithsonian Folklife Festival, many regional festivals have been established in all parts of the country. These include the Northwest Folklife Festival, the New England Folk Festival and the Philadelphia Folk Festival to name just a few. Each of these is supported by various institutions of public folklore, with the goal of displaying traditions of regional, ethnic and occupational folk groups. None of them however has duplicated the Smithsonian Folklore tent intended to collect original family folklore.\n\nOral history and oral tradition first became recognized as legitimate forms of historical and cultural research in the 1960s and early 1970s. Pioneers in this field used newly developed inexpensive tape-recorders to record oral histories. A Pulitzer Prize was awarded to Studs Terkel in 1985 for his book \"\"The Good War\": An Oral History of World War II\" and a special Pulitzer Prize was awarded to Alex Haley in 1977 for \"Roots: The Saga of an American Family\". With these awards, the importance of oral histories and traditions as a bona fide tool of historical and cultural research was cemented.\n\nHistorical and folklore research using oral interviews has gone mainstream, with multiple organizations dedicated to its collection. One of the best known organizations is StoryCorps, founded in 2003 and modeled on the WPA Federal Writers Project. Its expressed mission is to \"record, preserve, and share stories of Americans from all backgrounds and beliefs\". Special projects reach out to targeted populations to fulfill StoryCorps' commitment to record a diverse array of voices. The only requirement for the 2-person interview is that the 2 participants \"care about each other\", for instance family members. The participants are given a recording of the interview to take with them and add to the family archive. \n\nStoryCorps is just one of many organizations with a goal of recording and preserving interviews of oral history and tradition. Other organizations abound, such as City Lore of New York City and the Oral History Society of London. \n\n\n\n\n"}

Held in Oberhausen, it is one of the major international platforms for short form. The festival holds an International Competition, German Competition and International Children’s and Youth Film Competition as well as the MuVi Award for best German music video and, since 2009, the NRW Competition for productions from the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.\n\nOberhausen is furthermore known today for its extensive thematic programmes such as “Shooting Animals. A Brief History of Animal Film” (2011), \"Memories Can't Wait. Film without Film\" (2014) or \"The Third Image. 3D Cinema as Experiment\" (2015). The festival in addition offers visitors a well-equipped Video Library, operates a non-commercial short-film distribution service and owns an archive of short films from over 60 years of cinema history.\n\nThe International Short Film Festival Oberhausen was founded in 1954 by the director of the Oberhausen Volkshochschule (adult education centre), Hilmar Hoffmann, in association with the Filmclub Oberhausen under the name “1st West German Educational Film Festival”. The event was initially geared to fulfilling an educational policy mandate and the motto chosen for the first festival was hence “Cultural Film – Route to Education”. Featured were 45 films from the Federal Republic of Germany, France and the USA.\n\nAt the 4th West German Educational Film Festival, in 1958, the motto “Way to the Neighbour” was introduced, under which the festival took place until 1997. In 1959 the festival was rechristened “West German Short Film Festival”. Oberhausen soon made a political name for itself, chiefly because many films produced in the Eastern Bloc could only be viewed in Oberhausen, a situation that led to the festival’s rapid ascent and its reputation as “short film mecca”. As early as the 1950s, however, visitors were also treated to works by young filmmakers from the West such as François Truffaut, Norman McLaren, Alain Resnais, Bert Haanstra and Lindsay Anderson. At the fourth festival in 1958, 190 films from 29 countries were already included in the programme.\n\nAt the eighth festival in 1962 a group of young German filmmakers, among them Alexander Kluge, Peter Schamoni and Edgar Reitz, issued the Oberhausen Manifesto, pronouncing the “old” film dead and declaring their aspiration to create a new kind of German film.\n\nThe 1960s then culminated in a 1968 scandal surrounding Hellmuth Costard’s film Besonders wertvoll, in which a talking penis criticized the new Film Funding Act of 1967. Responding to an objection issued by the public prosecutor’s office, the festival removed the film from the official programme, whereupon many German filmmakers withdrew their works from the festival. Oberhausen emerged from the crisis with an amended set of regulations, including a public selection procedure for German films.\nIn the 1970s the women’s movement was a touchstone at the festival, with young filmmakers such as Chantal Akerman and Helma Sanders-Brahms showing their first films in Oberhausen. With its Children’s and Youth Cinema, the festival inaugurated a new competition category in 1978. The 1970s also witnessed a wave of new festivals: ousted from the cinema, the short form found new screening options in the festival arena.\n\nIn the late 1980s video and new media began to gradually come onto the scene at Oberhausen. With the subsidence of the East/West conflict that had shaped the festival’s early years, its role as “window to the East” slowly faded. Now, the festival’s profile as mediator and trailblazer between the worlds of short film and advertising clip, music video, industrial film and video art – often subsumed under the generic term avant-garde – came to the fore.\n\nIn 1991 the festival was renamed the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen, the name it still bears today. That same year, Oberhausen introduced the nation’s first competition for German short film. Since 1993 the festival has given film and video equal standing in its competitions. In 1999 Oberhausen introduced the first film-festival award for music videos anywhere in the world, known as the MuVi, which is still today awarded exclusively to directors for the visual quality of their clips.[3] With the rise of video art more and more films made by artists have found their way into the festival programmes.\n\nToday Oberhausen presents short films and videos originating from a wide range of formal, cultural and social backgrounds. Large-scale special programmes take up a different theme each year, most recently “Shooting Animals. A Brief History of Animal Film” (2011), \"Memories Can't Wait. Film without Film\" (2014) and \"The Third Image. 3D Cinema as Experiment (2015). The festival also maintains a Video Library featuring a large selection of recent international short films, regularly mounts profile programmes dedicated to individual artists, and each year hosts a discussion series called “Podium”.\n\nBesides organizing the festival, Oberhausen operates a non-commercial short film distribution service and its own archive holding short films from over 60 years of film history.\n\n“I smoked my first cigarette here. For years, I saw every single film at the Westdeutsche Kurzfilmtage, looking forward to those days in Oberhausen every year. These events were important for me, for my decision to become a filmmaker.” Wim Wenders, filmmaker, Germany\n\n“Short film is a great first step for a budding filmmaker. That’s how I made my beginnings, and Oberhausen was an important step on my path to become a director.” Roman Polanski, filmmaker, Poland/France\n\nDuring the long history of the Oberhausen festival, many careers got off to a successful start. A few of the filmmakers and artists who showed their early works in Oberhausen: : Eija-Liisa Ahtila, Doug Aitken, Kenneth Anger, Andrea Arnold, Jürgen Böttcher, Stan Brakhage, Vera Chytilová, Valie Export, Miloš Forman, Werner Herzog, Christoph Hochhäusler, Hermine Huntgeburth, Joris Ivens, Isaac Julien, Miranda July, Romuald Karmakar, Jochen Kuhn, Jan Lenica, Chris Marker, Bjørn Melhus, Dore O., Roman Polanski, Pipilotti Rist, Christoph Schlingensief, Martin Scorsese, István Szabó, Agnès Varda, Adolf Winkelmann.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46558872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46558872", "title": "Kiss The Girls: Make Them Cry", "text": "Kiss The Girls: Make Them Cry\n\nKiss The Girls: Make Them Cry is a 1979 video art piece by Dara Birnbaum. The piece is constructed of footage recorded from the television game show \"Hollywood Squares\". The bulk of the piece is made up from recorded introductory gestures of female celebrities participating in that game show, which are synced to then-contemporary disco songs.\n\nLike Birnbaum's 1978 video \"Technology/Transformation: Wonder Woman\" \"Kiss The Girls: Make Them Cry\" was created via Birnbaum's recording of broadcast television, which consists of a great part of her late 1970s practice The content of the video consists of segments of the introductory shots of female celebrities on the television game show \"Hollywood Squares\", in which they greet the audience with exaggerated body movements and facial gestures. These segments are repeated throughout the video, and are often rewound giving a \"jerky\" appearance to these shots. The face shots are accompanied by panning shots of the tic-tac-toe board of the \"Hollywood Squares\" set, showing the entire grid and the celebrities within.\n\nIn between \"Hollywood Squares\" footage, Birnbaum places black screens with white layers displaying the lyrics to songs used in the video. Two of these songs are by amateur singers, \"Yellow Bird\" and the English nursery rhyme Georgie Porgie, the latter of which being the origin of the video's title. Birnbaum also uses two contemporary disco songs in this piece, including the band Toto's adaptation of the previous rhyme Georgy Porgy and singer-songwriting duo Ashford & Simpson's Found a Cure. Unlike the other songs, Toto's \"Georgy Porgy\" is synchronized to the introductory shots, with the music choreographing and animating the movements of the women in the squares.\n\nIn creating \"Kiss The GIrls: Make Them Cry\" Birnbaum chose women she considered female stereotypes on \"Hollywood Squares\", whose careers \"had mostly faded.\" Birnbaum chose women from three categories: a blond, a brunette, and a child, unique due to their self presentation in the game show. Likewise Birnbaum notes the \"unreal\" nature of these gestures along with their intent of appealing to a large television audience. Birnbaum's choice of contemporary disco songs was informed by her perception of the Hollywood Squares grid looking like a Disco floor.\n\nMuch of the critical response of \"Kiss The Girls: Make Them Cry\" examines Birnbaum's appropriation of television footage and critique of portrayals of femininity on television. Pamela Lee argues that \"Kiss the Girls: Make Them Cry\" is a portrayal of the game show as a \"spectacle of gendered dynamics\" in which the extroverted motions and gestures of the female contestants become a mechanism for the circulation of their images. For Lee the women in the video act as an \"imagined spectrum of 'feminine' behavior,\" with these behaviors shown without their motivation. The synching of the repeated gestures to \"Georgy Porgy\" also allows the viewer to focus on the gesture itself, divorced from its original intent.\n\nIn his 1982 article \"Allegorical Procedures: Appropriation and Montage in Contemporary Art\" Benjamin Buchloh analyzes \"Kiss The Girls: Make Them Cry\" as part of an examination of the artistic technique of appropriation. Buchloh characterizes Birnbaum's television footage video works as focused on the genres and conventions of television, along with claiming that due to the \"revelatory\" nature of her work she can be set against media artists who sought to bring television \"up to date.\" In analyzing Birnbaum's videos Buchloh claims that Birnbaum's work reveals \"the theater of professional facial expressions, performed by actors on the television screen,\" which he sees as a new site of the domination of human behavior by ideology. Buchloh backs up this assertion by referring to \"Kiss The Girls: Make Them Cry,\" describing the video as the intersection of \"physiognomic detail and meaning\" along with referring to another Birnbaum video \"POP-POP VIDEO: General Hospital/Olympic Women Speed Skating (1980).\n\nChristine Ross focuses on the editing, arguing cutting to \"not sequences or fragments but mere instants\" remove the context women in the media are seen through.\n\n"}

After an opening dedication to Magnani for her acting ability, it consists of two parts, one titled \"Una voce umana\" (\"A Human Voice\") and the other \"Il miracolo\" (\"The Miracle\"). The second part was banned in the United States, until cleared in 1952 by a Supreme Court decision upholding the right to free speech.\n\nAdapted by Rossellini from a 1930 play \"La Voix humaine\" by Jean Cocteau, this features an unnamed woman (Magnani) alone in her apartment who over the telephone is desperately trying to salvage her relationship with the man that has left her.\n\nCo-written by Fellini and Rossellini, this features Nanni (Magnani) as a simple-minded and obsessively religious woman who guards goats on a mountainside near Amalfi. When a handsome bearded wanderer (Fellini) passes, she takes him to be Saint Joseph. Offering his flask of wine, he gets her drunk and she falls asleep. When she wakes up, he is gone and she is convinced that his appearance was a miracle. Some months later, when she faints in an orchard, the women who help her find she is pregnant. She believes this is another miracle, but to the people she becomes a figure of fun until, fleeing their mockery, she lives rough. As her time approaches, carrying her few possessions and accompanied only by a friendly nanny goat, she wearily climbs to a mountain top where there is an isolated church. Inside, we hear the cry of a newborn baby and see her opening her dress to feed her miraculous child.\n\nThe film was first exhibited in Europe in 1948, starting in Italy. Magnani was awarded the Nastro d'Argento (Silver Ribbon) in 1949 for best actress for her performance. Due to legal complications over the rights to Cocteau's play, the original version was not widely shown.\n\nIn 1950 \"The Miracle\" was removed from \"L'amore\" and placed in a three-part anthology film called \"The Ways of Love\" with two other short films: Jean Renoir's \"A Day in the Country\" (1936) and Marcel Pagnol's \"Jofroi\" (1933). After the U.S. distributor Joseph Burstyn exhibited it with English subtitles in New York in November 1950, it was voted the best foreign language film of 1950 by the New York Film Critics Circle. However, \"The Miracle\" part of the film was condemned by the National Legion of Decency as \"anti-Catholic\" and \"sacrilegious\" and in February 1951 the New York State Board of Regents, in charge of film censorship for the state, revoked the license to show the film. \n\nThis led to the lawsuit \"Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson\", finally decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1952 who, in what is popularly known as \"The Miracle Decision\", declared that the film was a form of artistic expression protected by the freedom of speech guarantee in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\n"}
{"id": "5679416", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5679416", "title": "Latin American culture", "text": "Latin American culture\n\nLatin American culture is the formal or informal expression of the people of Latin America and includes both high culture (literature and high art) and popular culture (music, folk art, and dance) as well as religion and other customary practices. \n\nDefinitions of Latin America vary. From a cultural perspective,\nLatin America generally includes those parts of the Americas where Spanish, French, or Portuguese prevail: Mexico, most of Central America, and South America. There is also an important Latin American cultural presence in the United States (such as in California, Florida, the Southwest, and cities such as New York City and Miami). There is also increasing attention to the relations between Latin America and the Caribbean as a whole. See further discussion of definitions at Latin America.\n\nThe richness of Latin American culture is the product of many influences, including:\n\n\nLatin America has a very diverse population with many ethnic groups and different ancestries. Only in three countries, do the Amerindians make up the majority of the population. This is the case of Peru, Guatemala and Bolivia. In the rest of the continents, most of the Amerindian descendants are of mixed race ancestry.\n\nIn the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries there was a flow of Iberian emigrants who left for Latin America. It was never a large movement of people but over the long period of time it had a major impact on Latin American populations: the Portuguese left for Brazil and the Spaniards left for the rest of the vast region. Of the European immigrants, men greatly outnumbered women and many married natives. This resulted in a mixing of the Amerindians and Europeans and today their descendants are known as mestizos. Even Latin Americans who are considered \"European\" usually have some native ancestry. Today, mestizos make up the majority of Latin America's population.\n\nStarting in the late 16th century, a large number of African slaves were brought to Latin America, especially to Brazil and the Caribbean. Nowadays, blacks make up the majority of the population in most Caribbean. Many of the African slaves in Latin America mixed with the Europeans and their descendants (known as Mulattoes) make up the majority of the population in some countries, such as the Dominican Republic, and large percentages in Brazil, Colombia, etc. Mixes between the blacks and Amerindians also occurred, and their descendants are known as Zambos. Many Latin American countries also have a substantial tri-racial population, which ancestry is a mix of Amerindians, Europeans and Africans.\n\nLarge numbers of European immigrants arrived in Latin America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most of them settling in the Southern Cone (Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and southern Brazil) and Northern Mexico. Nowadays the Southern Cone has a majority of people of largely European descent and in all more than 80% of Latin America's European population, which is mostly descended from five groups of immigrants: Italians, Spaniards, Portuguese, French, Germans and, to a lesser extent, Irish, Poles, Greeks, Croats, Russians, Welsh, Ukrainians, etc.\n\nIn this same period, immigrants came from the Middle East and Asia, including Indians, Lebanese, Syrians, and, more recently, Koreans, Chinese and Japanese, mainly to Brazil. These people only make up a small percentage of Latin America's population but they have communities in the major cities.\n\nThis diversity has profoundly influenced religion, music and politics. This cultural heritage is (arguably improperly) called Latin or Latino in American English. Outside of the United States, and in many languages (especially romance ones) \"Latino\" just means \"Latin\", referring to cultures and peoples that can trace their heritage back to the ancient Roman Empire. Latin American is the proper term.\n\nSpanish is the language in the majority of the countries (See Spanish language in the Americas). Portuguese is spoken primarily in Brazil (See Brazilian Portuguese), where it is both the official and the national language. French is also spoken in smaller countries, in the Caribbean, and French Guiana.\n\nSeveral nations, especially in the Caribbean, have their own Creole languages, derived from European languages and various African tongues. Amerindian languages are spoken in many Latin American nations, mainly Peru, Panama, Ecuador, Guatemala, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Mexico. Nahuatl is one of the most spoken indigenous languages with more than a million speakers in Mexico, which is officially confirmed by a government's census. Although Mexico has almost 80 native languages across the country, the government nor the constitution specify an official language (not even Spanish), also, some regions of the nation do not speak any modern way of language and still preserve their ancient dialect without knowing any other language. Guaraní is, along with Spanish, the official language of Paraguay, and is spoken by a majority of the population.\n\nOther European languages spoken include Italian in Brazil and Argentina, German in southern Brazil, southern Chile and Argentina, and Welsh in southern Argentina.\n\nThe primary religion throughout Latin America is Christianity (90%), mostly Roman Catholicism. Latin America, and in particular Brazil, were active in developing the quasi-socialist Roman Catholic movement known as Liberation Theology. Practitioners of the Protestant, Pentecostal, Evangelical, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormon, Buddhist, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Bahá'í, and indigenous denominations and religions exist. Various Afro-Latin American traditions, such as Santería, and Macumba, a tribal- voodoo religion, are also practiced. Evangelicalism in particular is increasing in popularity.\n\nIn long-term perspective, Britain's influence in Latin America was enormous after independence came in the 1820s. Britain deliberately sought to replace the Spanish in economic and cultural affairs. Military issues and colonization were minor factors. The influence was exerted through diplomacy, trade, banking, and investment in railways and mines. The English language and British cultural norms were transmitted by energetic young British business agents on temporary assignment in the major commercial centers, where they inviting locals into the British leisure activities, such as organized sports, and into their transplanted cultural institutions such as schools and clubs. The British role never disappeared, but it faded rapidly after 1914 as the British cashed in their investments to pay for their Great War, and the United States moved into the region with overwhelming force and similar cultural norms. \nThe British impact on sports was overwhelming, as Latin America enthusiastically took up football ((called fútbol in Spanish)). In Argentina, rugby, polo, tennis and golf became important in middle-class leisure. \n\nIn some parts of the Caribbean and Central America baseball outshined soccer in terms of popularity. The sport started in the late 19th century when sugar companies imported cane cutters from the British Caribbean. During their free time, the workers would play cricket, but later, during the long period of US military occupation, cricket gave way to baseball, which rapidly assumed widespread popularity, although cricket remains the favorite in the British Caribbean. Baseball had the greatest following in those nations occupied at length by the US military, especially the Dominican Republic and Cuba, as well as Nicaragua, Panama, and Puerto Rico. All of these countries have emerged as sources of baseball talent, since many players hone their skills on local teams, or in “academies” managed by the US Major Leagues to cultivate the most promising young men for their own teams.\n\nBeyond the rich tradition of indigenous art, the development of Latin American visual art owed much to the influence of Spanish, Portuguese and French Baroque painting, which in turn often followed the trends of the Italian Masters. In general, this artistic Eurocentrism began to fade in the early 20th century, as Latin-Americans began to acknowledge the uniqueness of their condition and started to follow their own path.\n\nFrom the early 20th century, the art of Latin America was greatly inspired by the Constructivist Movement. The Constructivist Movement was founded in Russia around 1913 by Vladimir Tatlin. The Movement quickly spread from Russia to Europe and then into Latin America. Joaquín Torres García and Manuel Rendón have been credited with bringing the Constructivist Movement into Latin America from Europe.\n\nAn important artistic movement generated in Latin America is \"Muralism\" represented by Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, José Clemente Orozco, Rufino Tamayo and many others in Mexico and Santiago Martinez Delgado, Pedro Nel Gómez in Colombia. Candido Portinari represented the monumentality of Muralism in his paintings, making chronicles the Brazilian people and their realities. Some of the most impressive muralist works can be found in Mexico, Colombia, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Philadelphia.\n\nMexican painter Frida Kahlo remains by far the most known and famous Latin American artist. She painted about her own life and the Mexican culture in a style combining Realism, Symbolism and Surrealism. Kahlo's work commands the highest selling price of all Latin American paintings.\n\nPre-Columbian cultures were primarily oral, though the Aztecs and Mayans, for instance, produced elaborate codices. Oral accounts of mythological and religious beliefs were also sometimes recorded after the arrival of European colonizers, as was the case with the Popol Vuh. Moreover, a tradition of oral narrative survives to this day, for instance among the Quechua-speaking population of Peru and the Quiché of Guatemala.\n\nFrom the very moment of Europe's \"discovery\" of the continent, early explorers and conquistadores produced written accounts and crónicas of their experience—such as Columbus's letters or Bernal Díaz del Castillo's description of the conquest of Mexico. During the colonial period, written culture was often in the hands of the church, within which context Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz wrote memorable poetry and philosophical essays. Towards the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th, a distinctive criollo literary tradition emerged, including the first novels such as Lizardi's El Periquillo Sarniento (1816).\n\nThe 19th century was a period of \"foundational fictions\" (in critic Doris Sommer's words), novels in the Romantic or Naturalist traditions that attempted to establish a sense of national identity, and which often focussed on the indigenous question or the dichotomy of \"civilization or barbarism\" (for which see, say, Domingo Sarmiento's \"Facundo\" (1845), Juan León Mera's \"Cumandá\" (1879), or Euclides da Cunha's \"Os Sertões\" (1902)).\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, \"modernismo\" emerged, a poetic movement whose founding text was Rubén Darío's \"Azul\" (1888). This was the first Latin American literary movement to influence literary culture outside of the region, and was also the first truly Latin American literature, in that national differences were no longer so much at issue. José Martí, for instance, though a Cuban patriot, also lived in Mexico and the United States and wrote for journals in Argentina and elsewhere.\n\nHowever, what really put Latin American literature on the global map was no doubt the literary boom of the 1960s and 1970s, distinguished by daring and experimental novels (such as Julio Cortázar's \"Rayuela\" (1963)) that were frequently published in Spain and quickly translated into English. The Boom's defining novel was Gabriel García Márquez's Cien años de soledad (1967), which led to the association of Latin American literature with magic realism, though other important writers of the period such as Mario Vargas Llosa and Carlos Fuentes do not fit so easily within this framework. Arguably, the Boom's culmination was Augusto Roa Bastos's monumental \"Yo, el supremo\" (1974). In the wake of the Boom, influential precursors such as Juan Rulfo, Alejo Carpentier, and above all Jorge Luis Borges were also rediscovered.\n\nContemporary literature in the region is vibrant and varied, ranging from the best-selling Paulo Coelho and Isabel Allende to the more avant-garde and critically acclaimed work of writers such as Giannina Braschi, Diamela Eltit, Ricardo Piglia, Roberto Bolaño or Daniel Sada. There has also been considerable attention paid to the genre of testimony, texts produced in collaboration with subaltern subjects such as Rigoberta Menchú. Finally, a new breed of chroniclers is represented by the more journalistic Carlos Monsiváis and Pedro Lemebel.\n\nThe region boasts six Nobel Prizewinners: in addition to the Colombian García Márquez (1982), also the Chilean poet Gabriela Mistral (1945), the Guatemalan novelist Miguel Ángel Asturias (1967), the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda (1971), the Mexican poet and essayist Octavio Paz (1990), and the Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa (2010).\n\nIn the 1870-1930 period, the philosophy of positivism or \"cientificismo\" associated with Auguste Comte in France and Herbert Spencer in England exerted a strong influence on intellectuals, experts and writers in most of the region.\n\nIntellectuals embraced positivism with enthusiasm as they say it as the key to modernization of their economies and societies and a weapon to break the old colonial patterns that still survived. Positivism influenced government policy; In Mexico, for example, the administration of President Porfirio Díaz (1876 to 1911) relied heavily on a group of scientific and technocratic advisors who reflected Positivist thinking.\n\nLatin American music comes in many varieties, from the simple, rural conjunto music of northern Mexico to the sophisticated habanera of Cuba, from the symphonies of Heitor Villa-Lobos to the simple and moving Andean flute. Music has played an important part in Latin America's turbulent recent history, for example the nueva canción movement. Latin music is very diverse, with the only truly unifying thread being the use of the Spanish language or, in Brazil, its close cousin the Portuguese language.\n\nLatin America can be divided into several musical areas. Andean music, for example, includes the countries of western South America, typically Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, Ecuador, Chile and Venezuela; Central American music includes Nicaragua, El Salvador, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and Costa Rica. Caribbean music includes the Caribbean coast of Colombia, Panama, and many Spanish and French-speaking islands in the Caribbean, including Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the less noted Martinique and Guadeloupe. The inclusion of the French West Indies varies by scholars. Brazil perhaps constitutes its own musical area, both because of its large size and incredible diversity as well as its unique history as a Portuguese colony. Although Spain isn't a part of Latin America, Spanish music (and Portuguese music) and Latin American music strongly cross-fertilized each other, but Latin music also absorbed influences from the Anglo-Saxon world, and particularly, African music.\n\nOne of the main characteristics of Latin American music is its diversity, from the lively rhythms of Central America and the Caribbean to the more austere sounds of southern South America. Another feature of Latin American music is its original blending of the variety of styles that arrived in The Americas and became influential, from the early Spanish and European Baroque to the different beats of the African rhythms.\n\nLatino-Caribbean music, such as salsa, merengue, bachata, etc., are styles of music that have been strongly influenced by African rhythms and melodies.\n\nOther musical genres of Latin America include the Argentine and Uruguayan tango, the Colombian cumbia and vallenato, Mexican ranchera, the Cuban salsa, bolero, rumba and mambo Nicaraguan palo de mayo, Uruguayan Candombe, the Panamanian cumbia, tamborito, saloma and pasillo, and the various styles of music from Pre-Columbian traditions that are widespread in the Andean region. In Brazil, samba, American jazz, European classical music and choro combined into \"bossa nova\". Recently the Haitian kompa has become increasingly popular.\n\nThe classical composer Heitor Villa-Lobos (1887–1959) worked on the recording of native musical traditions within his homeland of Brazil. The traditions of his homeland heavily influenced his classical works. Also notable is the much recent work of the Cuban Leo Brouwer and guitar work of the Venezuelan Antonio Lauro and the Paraguayan Agustín Barrios.\n\nArguably, the main contribution to music entered through folklore, where the true soul of the Latin American and Caribbean countries is expressed. Musicians such as Atahualpa Yupanqui, Violeta Parra, Víctor Jara, Mercedes Sosa, Jorge Negrete, Caetano Veloso, Yma Sumac and others gave magnificent examples of the heights that this soul can reach, for example:the Uruguayan born and first Latin American musician to win an OSCAR prize, Jorge Drexler.\n\nLatin pop, including many forms of rock, is popular in Latin America today (see Spanish language rock and roll).\n\nLatin American film is both rich and diverse. But the main centers of production have been Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Cuba.\n\nLatin American cinema flourished after the introduction of sound, which added a linguistic barrier to the export of Hollywood film south of the border. The 1950s and 1960s saw a movement towards Third Cinema, led by the Argentine filmmakers Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino. More recently, a new style of directing and stories filmed as been tagged as \"New Latin American Cinema.\"\n\nMexican movies from the Golden Era in the 1940s are significant examples of Latin American cinema, with a huge industry comparable to the Hollywood of those years. More recently movies such as \"Amores Perros\" (2000) and \"Y tu mamá también\" (2001) have been successful in creating universal stories about contemporary subjects, and were internationally recognised. Nonetheless, the country has also witnsessed the rise of experimental filmmakers such as Carlos Reygadas and Fernando Eimbicke who focus on more universal themes and characters. Other important Mexican directors are Arturo Ripstein and Guillermo del Toro.\n\nArgentine cinema was a big industry in the first half of the 20th century. After a series of military governments that shackled culture in general, the industry re-emerged after the 1976–1983 military dictatorship to produce the Academy Award winner \"The Official Story\" in 1985. The Argentine economic crisis affected the production of films in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but many Argentine movies produced during those years were internationally acclaimed, including \"Plata Quemada\" (2000), \"Nueve reinas\" (2000), \"El abrazo partido\" (2004) and \"Roma\" (2004).\n\nIn Brazil, the \"Cinema Novo\" movement created a particular way of making movies with critical and intellectual screenplays, a clearer photography related to the light of the outdoors in a tropical landscape, and a political message. The modern Brazilian film industry has become more profitable inside the country, and some of its productions have received prizes and recognition in Europe and the United States. Movies like \"Central do Brasil\" (1999) and \"Cidade de Deus\" (2003) have fans around the world, and its directors have taken part in American and European film projects.\n\nCuban cinema has enjoyed much official support since the Cuban revolution, and important filmmakers include Tomás Gutiérrez Alea.\n\nLatin America has a strong tradition of evolving dance styles. Some of its dance and music is considered to emphasize sexuality, and have become popular outside of their countries of origin. Salsa and the more popular Latin dances were created and embraced into the culture in the early and middle 1900s and has since been able to retain its significance both in and outside the Americas. The mariachi bands of Mexico stirred up quick paced rhythms and playful movements at the same time that Cuba embraced similar musical and dance styles. Traditional dances were blended with new, modern ways of moving, evolving into a blended, more contemporary forms.\n\nBallroom studios teach lessons on many Latin American dances. One can even find the cha-cha being done in honky-tonk country bars. Miami has been a large contributor of the United States’ involvement in Latin dancing. With such a huge Puerto Rican and Cuban population one can find Latin dancing and music in the streets at any time of day or night.\n\nSome of the dances of Latin America are derived from and named for the type of music they are danced to. For example, mambo, salsa, cha-cha-cha, rumba, merengue, samba, flamenco, bachata, and, probably most recognizable, the tango are among the most popular. Each of the types of music has specific steps that go with the music, the counts, the rhythms, and the style.\n\nModern Latin American dancing is very energetic. These dances primarily are performed with a partner as a social dance, but solo variations exist. The dances emphasize passionate hip movements and the connection between partners. Many of the dances are done in a close embrace while others are more traditional and similar to ballroom dancing, holding a stronger frame between the partners.\n\nTheatre in Latin America existed before the Europeans came to the continent. The natives of Latin America had their own rituals, festivals, and ceremonies. They involved dance, singing of poetry, song, theatrical skits, mime, acrobatics, and magic shows. The performers were trained; they wore costumes, masks, makeup, wigs. Platforms had been erected to enhance visibility. The ‘sets’ were decorated with branches from trees and other natural objects.\n\nThe Europeans used this to their advantage. For the first fifty years after the Conquest the missionaries used theatre widely to spread the Christian doctrine to a population accustomed to the visual and oral quality of spectacle and thus maintaining a form of cultural hegemony. It was more effective to use the indigenous forms of communication than to put an end to the ‘pagan’ practices, the conquerors took out the content of the spectacles, retained the trappings, and used them to convey their own message.\n\nPre-Hispanic rituals were how the indigenous came in contact with the divine. Spaniards used plays to Christianize and colonize the indigenous peoples of the Americas in the 16th century. Theatre was a potent tool in manipulating a population already accustomed to spectacle. Theatre became a tool for political hold on Latin America by colonialist theatre by using indigenous performance practices to manipulate the population.\n\nTheatre provided a way for the indigenous people were forced to participate in the drama of their own defeat. In 1599, the Jesuits even used cadavers of Native Americans to portray the dead in the staging of the final judgment.\n\nWhile the plays were promoting a new sacred order, their first priority was to support the new secular, political order. Theatre under the colonizers primarily at the service of the administration.\n\nAfter the large decrease in the native population, the indigenous consciousness and identity in theatre disappeared, though pieces did have indigenous elements to them. The theatre that progressed in Latin America is argued to be theatre that the conquerors brought to the Americas, not the theatre of the Americas.\n\nProgression in Postcolonial Latin American Theatre\n\nInternal strife and external interference have been the drive behind Latin American history which applies the same to theatre.\n\n1959–1968: dramaturgical structures and structures of social projects leaned more toward constructing a more native Latin American base called the \"Nuestra America\"\n\n1968–1974: Theatre tries to claim a more homogenous definition which brings in more European models. At this point, Latin American Theatre tried to connect to its historical roots.\n\n1974–1984: The search for expression rooted in the history of Latin America became victims of exile and death.\n\nLatin American cuisine is a phrase that refers to typical foods, beverages, and cooking styles common to many of the countries and cultures in Latin America. It should be noted that Latin America is a very diverse area of land that holds various cuisines that vary from nation to nation.\n\nSome items typical of Latin American cuisine include maize-based dishes and drinks (tortillas, tamales, arepas, pupusas, chicha morada, chicha de jora) and various salsas and other condiments (guacamole, pico de gallo, mole). These spices are generally what give the Latin American cuisines a distinct flavor in penors; yet, each country of Latin America tends to use a different spice and those that share spices tend to use them at different quantities. Thus, this leads for a variety across the land. Meat is also greatly consumed and constitutes one of the main dishes in many Latin American countries where they're considered specialties, referred to as Asado or Churrasco.\n\nLatin American beverages are just as distinct as their foods. Some of the beverages can even date back to the times of the Native Americans. Some popular beverages include mate, Pisco Sour, horchata, chicha, atole, cacao and aguas frescas.\n\nDesserts in Latin America include dulce de leche, alfajor, arroz con leche, tres leches cake, Teja and flan.\n\nTraditionally, Mexicans have struggled with the creation of a united identity. The issue is the main topic of Mexican Nobel Prize winner Octavio Paz's book \"The Labyrinth of Solitude\". Mexico is a large country with a large population, therefore having many cultural traits found only in some parts of the country. The north of Mexico is the least culturally diverse due to its very low Native American population and high density of those of European descent. Northern Mexicans are also more americanized due to the common border with the United States. Central and southern Mexico is where many well-known traditions find their origin, therefore the people from this area are in a way the most traditional, but their collective personality can't be generalized. People from Puebla, for instance, are thought to be conservative and reserved, and just a few kilometers away, the people from Veracruz have the fame of being very outgoing and liberal. Chilangos (Mexico City natives) are believed to be a bit aggressive, and self-centered. The regiomontanos (from Monterrey) are thought to be rather proud, regardless of their social status. Almost every Mexican state has its own accent, making it fairly easy to distinguish the origin of someone by their use of language.\n\nThe derogatory term naco was forged by the middle and upper class Mexicans to refer to the native or mestizo population. The term allegedly comes from the word totonaco, which is one of the ethnic groups in Valle de Mexico. Its use has been made popular even among the poorest classes. Mexicans differ in opinion about the meaning of the word. Some would use it for a person who dresses in a tacky or tasteless manner, some use it to refer to the natives, some to the poor classes, and other for people with less education or culture and other ideology. The term fresa is in some terms the opposite of naco, and it is not always derogatory and means always some relative high economical status of the person termed in that way. Traditionally, people with more European looks and belonging to the middle or high classes are called fresas.\n\nDancing and singing are commonly part of family gatherings, bringing the old and young together, no matter what kind of music is being played, like cumbia, salsa, merengue or the more Mexican banda. Dancing is a strong part of the culture.\n\nMexicans in places like Guadalajara, Puebla, Monterrey, Mexico City, and most middle sized cities, enjoy a great variety of options for leisure. Shopping centers are a favorite among families, since there has been an increasing number of new malls that cater to people of all ages and interests. A large number of them, have multiplex cinemas, international and local restaurants, food courts, cafes, bars, bookstores and most of the international renowned clothing brands are found too. Mexicans are prone to travel within their own country, making short weekend trips to a neighbouring city or town.\n\nThe standard of living in Mexico is higher than most of other countries in Latin America attracting migrants in search for better opportunities. With the recent economic growth, many high income families live in single houses, commonly found within a gated community, called \"fraccionamiento\". The reason these places are the most popular among the middle and upper classes is that they offer a sense of security and provide social status. Swimming pools or golf clubs, and/or some other commodities are found in these fraccionamientos. Poorer Mexicans, by contrast, live a harsh life, although they share the importance they grant to family, friends and cultural habits.\nTwo of the major television networks based in Mexico are Televisa and TV Azteca. Soap operas (telenovelas) are translated to many languages and seen all over the world with renown names like Verónica Castro, Lucía Méndez, Lucero, and Thalía. Even Gael García Bernal and Diego Luna from \"Y tu mamá también\" and current Zegna model act in some of them. Some of their TV shows are modeled after American counterparts like \"Family Feud\" (\"100 Mexicanos Dijeron\" or \"A hundred Mexicans said\" in Spanish), \"Big Brother\", \"American Idol\", \"Saturday Night Live\" and others. Nationwide news shows like \"Las Noticias por Adela\" on Televisa resemble a hybrid between \"Donahue\" and \"Nightline\". Local news shows are modeled after American counterparts like the \"Eyewitness News\" and \"Action News\" formats.\n\nMexico's national sports are charreria and bullfighting. Ancient Mexicans played a ball game which still exists in Northwest Mexico (Sinaloa, the game is called Ulama), though it is not a popular sport any more. Most Mexicans enjoy watching bullfights. Almost all large cities have bullrings. Mexico city has the largest bullring in the world, which seats 55,000 people. But the favorite sport remains football (soccer) while baseball is also popular especially in the northern states because of the American influence, and a number of Mexicans have become stars in the US Major Leagues. Professional wrestling is shown on shows like Lucha Libre. American football is practiced at the major universities like UNAM. Basketball has also been gaining popularity, with a number of Mexican players having been drafted to play in the National Basketball Association.\n\nThe culture of Guatemala reflects strong Mayan and Spanish influences and continues to be defined as a contrast between poor Mayan villagers in the rural highlands, and the urbanized and wealthy mestizos population who occupy the cities and surrounding agricultural plains.\n\nThe cuisine of Guatemala reflects the multicultural nature of Guatemala, in that it involves food that differs in taste depending on the region. Guatemala has 22 departments (or divisions), each of which has very different food varieties. For example, Antigua Guatemala is well known for its candy which makes use of many local ingredients fruits, seeds and nuts along with honey, condensed milk and other traditional sweeteners. Antigua's candy is very popular when tourists visit the country for the first time, and is a great choice in the search for new and interesting flavors.\nMany traditional foods are based on Maya cuisine and prominently feature corn, chiles and beans as key ingredients. Various dishes may have the same name as a dish from a neighboring country, but may in fact be quite different for example the enchilada or quesadilla, which are nothing like their Mexican counterparts.\nThe music of Guatemala is diverse. Guatemala's national instrument is the marimba, an idiophone from the family of the xylophones, which is played all over the country, even in the remotest corners. Towns also have wind and percussion bands -week processions, as well as on other occasions. The Garifuna people of Afro-Caribbean descent, who are spread thinly on the northeastern Caribbean coast, have their own distinct varieties of popular and folk music. Cumbia, from the Colombian variety, is also very popular especially among the lower classes. Dozens of Rock bands have emerged in the last two decades, making rock music quite popular among young people.\nGuatemala also has an almost five-century-old tradition of art music, spanning from the first liturgical chant and polyphony introduced in 1524 to contemporary art music. Much of the music composed in Guatemala from the 16th century to the 19th century has only recently been unearthed by scholars and is being revived by performers.\nGuatemalan literature is famous around the world whether in the indigenous languages present in the country or in Spanish. Though there was likely literature in Guatemala before the arrival of the Spanish, all the texts that exist today were written after their arrival.\nThe Popol Vuh is the most significant work of Guatemalan literature in the Quiché language, and one of the most important of Pre-Columbian American literature. It is a compendium of Mayan stories and legends, aimed to preserve Mayan traditions. The first known version of this text dates from the 16th century and is written in Quiché transcribed in Latin characters. It was translated into Spanish by the Dominican priest Francisco Ximénez in the beginning of the 18th century. Due to its combination of historical, mythical, and religious elements, it has been called the Mayan Bible. It is a vital document for understanding the culture of pre-Columbian America.\nThe Rabinal Achí is a dramatic work consisting of dance and text that is preserved as it was originally represented. It is thought to date from the 15th century and narrates the mythical and dynastic origins of the Kek'chi' people, and their relationships with neighboring peoples. The Rabinal Achí is performed during the Rabinal festival of January 25, the day of Saint Paul. It was declared a masterpiece of oral tradition of humanity by UNESCO in 2005.\nThe 16th century saw the first native-born Guatemalan writers that wrote in Spanish. Major writers of this era include Sor Juana de Maldonado, considered the first poet playwright of colonial Central America, and the historian Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzmán. The Jesuit Rafael Landívar (1731–1793) is considered as the first great Guatemalan poet. He was forced into exile by Carlos III. He traveled to Mexico and later to Italy, where he did. He originally wrote his Rusticatio Mexicana and his poems praising the bishop Figueredo y Victoria in Latin.\nThe Maya people are known for their brightly colored yarn-based textiles, which are woven into capes, shirts, blouses, huipiles and dresses. Each village has its own distinctive pattern, making it possible to distinguish a person's home town on sight. Women's clothing consists of a shirt and a long skirt.\n\nRoman Catholicism combined with the indigenous Maya religion are the unique syncretic religion which prevailed throughout the country and still does in the rural regions. Beginning from negligible roots prior to 1960, however, Protestant Pentecostalism has grown to become the predominant religion of Guatemala City and other urban centers and down to mid-sized towns.\nThe unique religion is reflected in the local saint, Maximón, who is associated with the subterranean force of masculine fertility and prostitution. Always depicted in black, he wears a black hat and sits on a chair, often with a cigar placed in his mouth and a gun in his hand, with offerings of tobacco, alcohol and Coca-Cola at his feet. The locals know him as San Simon of Guatemala.\n\nNicaraguan culture has several distinct strands. The Pacific coast has strong folklore, music and religious traditions, deeply influenced by European culture but enriched with Amerindian sounds and flavors. The Pacific coast of the country was colonized by Spain and has a similar culture to other Spanish-speaking Latin American countries. The Caribbean coast of the country, on the other hand, was once a British protectorate. English is still predominant in this region and spoken domestically along with Spanish and indigenous languages. Its culture is similar to that of Caribbean nations that were or are British possessions, such as Jamaica, Belize, The Cayman Islands, etc.\nNicaraguan music is a mixture of indigenous and European, especially Spanish and to a lesser extent German, influences. The latter was a result of the German migration to the central-north regions of Las Segovias where Germans settled and brought with them polka music which influenced and evolved into Nicaraguan mazurka, polka and waltz. The Germans that migrated to Nicaragua are speculated to have been from the regions of Germany which were annexed to present-day Poland following the Second World War; hence the genres of mazurka, polka in addition to the waltz. One of the more famous composers of classical music and Nicaraguan waltz was Jose de la Cruz Mena who was actually not from the northern regions of Nicaragua but rather from the city of Leon in Nicaragua.\n\nMore nationally identified however, are musical instruments such as the marimba which is also common across Central America. The marimba of Nicaragua is uniquely played by a sitting performer holding the instrument on his knees. It is usually accompanied by a bass fiddle, guitar and guitarrilla (a small guitar like a mandolin). This music is played at social functions as a sort of background music. The marimba is made with hardwood plates, placed over bamboo or metal tubes of varying lengths. It is played with two or four hammers. The Caribbean coast of Nicaragua is known for a lively, sensual form of dance music called Palo de Mayo. It is especially loud and celebrated during the Palo de Mayo festival in May The Garifuna community exists in Nicaragua and is known for its popular music called Punta.\n\nLiterature of Nicaragua can be traced to pre-Columbian times with the myths and oral literature that formed the cosmogonic view of the world that indigenous people had. Some of these stories are still know in Nicaragua. Like many Latin American countries, the Spanish conquerors have had the most effect on both the culture and the literature. Nicaraguan literature is among the most important in Spanish language, with world-famous writers such as Rubén Darío who is regarded as the most important literary figure in Nicaragua, referred to as the \"Father of Modernism\" for leading the modernismo literary movement at the end of the 19th century.\n\n\"El Güegüense\" is a satirical drama and was the first literary work of post-Columbian Nicaragua. It is regarded as one of Latin America's most distinctive colonial-era expressions and as Nicaragua's signature folkloric masterpiece combining music, dance and theater. The theatrical play was written by an anonymous author in the 16th century, making it one of the oldest indigenous theatrical/dance works of the Western Hemisphere. The story was published in a book in 1942 after many centuries.\n\nThe Andes Region comprises roughly much of what is now Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia, and was the seat of the Inca Empire in the pre-Columbian era. As such, many of the traditions date back to Incan traditions.\n\nDuring the independization of the Americas many countries including Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador and Panama formed what was known as Gran Colombia, a federal republic that later dissolved, however the people in these countries believe each other to be their brothers and sisters and as such share many traditions and festivals. Peru and Bolivia were also one single country until Bolivia declared its independence, nevertheless both nations are close neighbors that have somewhat similar cultures.\n\nBolivia and Peru both still have significant Native American populations (primarily Quechua and Aymara) which mixed Spanish cultural elements with their ancestors' traditions. The Spanish-speaking population mainly follows the Western customs. Important archaeological ruins, gold and silver ornaments, stone monuments, ceramics, and weavings remain from several important pre-Columbian cultures. Major Bolivian ruins include Tiwanaku, Samaipata, Incallajta, and Iskanwaya.\n\nThe majority of the Ecuadorian population is mestizo, a mixture of both European and Amerindian ancestry, and much like their ancestry, the national culture is also a blend of these two sources, along with influences from slaves from Africa in the coastal region. 95% of Ecuadorians are Roman Catholic.\n\nPeruvian culture is primarily rooted in Amerindian and Spanish traditions, though it has also been influenced by various African, Asian, and European ethnic groups.\n\nPeruvian artistic traditions date back to the elaborate pottery, textiles, jewelry, and sculpture of Pre-Inca cultures. The Incas maintained these crafts and made architectural achievements including the construction of Machu Picchu. Baroque art dominated in colonial times, though it was modified by native traditions. During this period, most art focused on religious subjects; the numerous churches of the era and the paintings of the Cuzco School are representative. Arts stagnated after independence until the emergence of \"Indigenismo\" in the early 20th century. Since the 1950s, Peruvian art has been eclectic and shaped by both foreign and local art currents.\n\nPeruvian literature has its roots in the oral traditions of pre-Columbian civilizations. Spaniards introduced writing in the 16th century, and colonial literary expression included chronicles and religious literature. After independence, Costumbrism and Romanticism became the most common literary genres, as exemplified in the works of Ricardo Palma. In the early 20th century, the \"Indigenismo\" movement produced such writers as Ciro Alegría, José María Arguedas, and César Vallejo. During the second half of the century, Peruvian literature became more widely known because of authors such as Mario Vargas Llosa, a leading member of the Latin American Boom.\n\nPeruvian cuisine is a blend of Amerindian and Spanish food with strong influences from African, Arab, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese cooking. Common dishes include \"anticuchos\", \"ceviche\", \"humitas\", and \"pachamanca\". Because of the variety of climates within Peru, a wide range of plants and animals are available for cooking. Peruvian cuisine has recently received acclaim due to its diversity of ingredients and techniques.\n\nPeruvian music has Andean, Spanish and African roots. In pre-Hispanic times, musical expressions varied widely from region to region; the \"quena\" and the \"tinya\" were two common instruments. Spanish conquest brought the introduction of new instruments such as the guitar and the harp, as well as the development of crossbred instruments like the \"charango\". African contributions to Peruvian music include its rhythms and the \"cajón\", a percussion instrument. Peruvian folk dances include the \"marinera\", \"tondero\" and \"huayno\".\n\nThe culture of Colombia lies at the crossroads of Latin America. Thanks partly to geography, Colombian culture has been heavily fragmented into five major cultural regions. Rural to urban migration and globalization have changed how many Colombians live and express themselves as large cities become melting pots of people (many of whom are refugees) from the various provinces.\nAccording to a study in late 2004 by the Erasmus University in Rotterdam, Colombians are one of the happiest people in the world; this despite its four-decade long armed conflict involving the government, paramilitaries, drug lords, corruption and guerrillas like the FARC and ELN. \n\nMany aspects of Colombian culture can be traced back to the culture of Spain of the 16th century and its collision with Colombia's native civilizations (see: Muisca, Tayrona). The Spanish brought Catholicism, African slaves, the feudal encomienda system, and a caste system that favored European-born whites. After independence from Spain, the \"criollos\" struggled to establish a pluralistic political system between conservative and liberal ideals.\n\nEthno-racial groups maintained their ancestral heritage culture: whites tried to keep themselves, despite the growing number of illegitimate children of mixed African or indigenous ancestry. These people were labeled with any number of descriptive names, derived from the \"casta\" system, such as mulato and moreno. Blacks and indigenous people of Colombia also mixed to form zambos creating a new ethno-racial group in society. This mix also created a fusion of cultures. Carnivals for example became an opportunity for all classes and colors to congregate without prejudice. The introduction of the bill of rights of men and the abolishment of slavery (1850) eased the segregationist tensions between the races, but the dominance of the whites prevailed and prevails to some extent to this day.\n\nThe industrial revolution arrived relatively late at the beginning of the 20th century with the establishment of the Republic of Colombia. Colombians had a period of almost 50 years of relative peace interrupted only by a short armed conflict with Peru over the town of Leticia in 1932.\n\nBogotá, the principal city, was the World Book Capital in 2007, in 2008 by the Iberoamerican Theatrum Festival Bogotá has been proclaimed as the world capital of theatre.\n\nVenezuelan culture has been shaped by indigenous, African and especially European Spanish. Before this period, indigenous culture was expressed in art (petroglyphs), crafts, architecture (\"shabonos\"), and social organization. Aboriginal culture was subsequently assimilated by Spaniards; over the years, the hybrid culture had diversified by region.\n\nAt present the Indian influence is limited to a few words of vocabulary and gastronomy. The African influence in the same way, in addition to musical instruments like the drum. The Spanish influence was more important and in particular came from the regions of Andalusia and Extremadura, places of origin of most settlers in the Caribbean during the colonial era. As an example of this can include buildings, part of the music, the Catholic religion and language. Spanish influences are evident bullfights and certain features of the cuisine. Venezuela also enriched by other streams of Indian and European origin in the 19th century, especially France. In the last stage of the great cities and regions entered the U.S. oil source and demonstrations of the new immigration of Spanish, Italian and Portuguese, increasing the already complex cultural mosaic. For example: From the United States comes the influence of the taste of baseball and modern architectural structures\n\nVenezuelan art is gaining prominence. Initially dominated by religious motifs, it began emphasizing historical and heroic representations in the late 19th century, a move led by Martín Tovar y Tovar. Modernism took over in the 20th century. Notable Venezuelan artists include Arturo Michelena, Cristóbal Rojas, Armando Reverón, Manuel Cabré, the kinetic artists Jesús-Rafael Soto and Carlos Cruz-Diez. Since the middle of the 20th century, artists such as Jacobo Borges, Régulo Perez, Pedro León Zapata, Harry Abend, Mario Abreu, Pancho Quilici, Carmelo Niño and Angel Peña emerged. They created a new plastic language. The 80s produced artist as Carlos Zerpa, Ernesto León, Miguel Von Dangel, Mateo Manaure, Patricia Van Dalen, Mercedes Elena González, Zacarías García and Manuel Quintana Castillo. In more recent times, Venezuela produced a new a diverse generation of innovating painters. Some of them are: Alejandro Bello, Edgard Álvarez Estrada, Gloria Fiallo, Felipe Herrera, Alberto Guacache and Morella Jurado.\n\nVenezuelan literature originated soon after the Spanish conquest of the mostly pre-literate indigenous societies; it was dominated by Spanish influences. Following the rise of political literature during the War of Independence, Venezuelan Romanticism, notably expounded by Juan Vicente González, emerged as the first important genre in the region. Although mainly focused on narrative writing, Venezuelan literature was advanced by poets such as Andrés Eloy Blanco and Fermín Toro. Major writers and novelists include Rómulo Gallegos, Teresa de la Parra, Arturo Uslar Pietri, Adriano González León, Miguel Otero Silva, and Mariano Picón Salas. The great poet and humanist Andrés Bello was also an educator and intellectual. Others, such as Laureano Vallenilla Lanz and José Gil Fortoul, contributed to Venezuelan Positivism.\n\nCarlos Raúl Villanueva was the most important Venezuelan architect of the modern era; he designed the Central University of Venezuela, (a World Heritage Site) and its Aula Magna. Other notable architectural works include the Capitol, the Baralt Theatre, the Teresa Carreño Cultural Complex, and the General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge.\n\nBaseball and football are Venezuela's most popular sports, and the Venezuela national football team, is passionately followed. Famous Venezuelan baseball players include Luis Aparicio (inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame), David (Dave) Concepción, Oswaldo (Ozzie) Guillén (current White Sox manager, World Series champion in 2005), Freddy Garcia, Andrés Galarraga, Omar Vizquel (an eleven-time Gold Glove winner), Luis Sojo, Miguel Cabrera, Bobby Abreu, Félix Hernández, Magglio Ordóñez, Ugueth Urbina, and Johan Santana (a two-time unanimously selected Cy Young Award winner).\n\n\nIn the 19th century, Brazilian theatre began with romanticism along with a fervor for political independence. During this time, racial issues were discussed in contradictory terms, but even so there were some significant plays, including a series of popular comedies by Martins Penna, Franqa Junior, and Arthur Azevedo.\n\nIn the 20th century, the two most important production centers for professional theatre were São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. They were centers of industrial and economic development. Even with the development of these two theatres, World War I brought an end to tours by European theatres so there were no productions in Brazil during this time.\n\nIn November 1927, Alvaro Moreyra founded the Toy Theatre (Teatro de Brinquedo). Like this company, it was in the late 1920s when the first stable theatre companies formed around well-known actors. These actors were able to practice authentic Brazilian gestures gradually freed from Portuguese influence. Except for some political criticism in the low comedies, the dramas of this period were not popular. Occasionally the question of dependence on Europe or North America was raised. Even with more Latin American influence of theatre starting to filter in, its theatre still was under heavy influence of Europe.\n\nThe Brazilian Comedy Theatre (Teatro Brasileiro de Comédia) was created in 1948\n\nOswald de Andrade wrote three plays; \"The King of the Candle\" (\"O Rei da Vela\", 1933), \"The Man and the Horse\" (\"O Homem e o Cavalo\", 1934). and \"The Dead Woman\" (\"A Morta\", 1937). They were an attempt to deal with political themes, nationalism, and anti-imperialism. His theatre was inspired by Meyerhold's and Brecht's theories, with a political sarcasm like Mayakovsky.\n\n1943 at The Comedians: Polish director and refugee from the Nazis, Zbigniew Ziembinsky, staged in expressionist style Nelson Rodrigues' \"A Bride's Gown\" (\"Vestido de Noiva\"). With this production, Brazilian theatre moved into the modem period.\nWorld War II saw Brazil gain several foreign directors, especially from Italy, who wanted to make a theatre free from nationalistic overtones. Paradoxically, this led to a second renewal which engaged popular forms and sentiments; a renewal that was decidedly nationalistic with social and even communist leanings.\n\nDuring this time, the Stanislavsky system of acting was most popular and widely used. Stanislavski himself came to Brazil via Eugenio Kusnet, a Russian actor who had met him at the Moscow Art Theatre.\n\nThe next phase was from 1958 to the signing of the Institutional Act Number Five in 1968. It marked the end of freedom and democracy. These ten years were the most productive of the century. During these years dramaturgy matured through the plays of Guarnieri, Vianinha, Boal, Dias Gomes, and Chico de Assis, as did mis-en-scene in the work of Boal, Jost Celso Martinez Correa, Flivio Rangel, and Antunes Filho. During this decade a generation accepted theatre as an activity with social responsibility.\n\nAt its height, this phase of Brazilian theatre was characterized by an affirmation of national values. Actors and directors became political activists who risked their jobs and lives daily.\n\nThrough this growth of Latin America politically and the influence of European theatre, an identity of what is theatre in Latin America stemmed out of it.\n\n\nModern painting was born in Brazil in Modern Art Week in 1922. Among the artists who have excelled in the 20th century, are Tarsila do Amaral and his cubist influence, as Di Cavalcanti, Candido Portinari also influenced by Cubism and Expressionism is the great names of Brazilian art and is the painter of \"War and Peace\", a panel at the United Nations in New York.\n\n\nBrazilian contemporary photography is one of the most creative in Latin America, growing an international prominence each year with exhibitions and publications. Names like Miguel Rio Branco, Vik Muniz, Sebastião Salgado, Guy Veloso, and others, get strong.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "156261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=156261", "title": "Los Angeles Philharmonic", "text": "Los Angeles Philharmonic\n\nThe Los Angeles Philharmonic (LA Phil or LAP) is an American orchestra based in Los Angeles, California. It has a regular season of concerts from October through June at the Walt Disney Concert Hall, and a summer season at the Hollywood Bowl from July through September. Gustavo Dudamel is the current Music Director, and Esa-Pekka Salonen is Conductor Laureate.\n\nMusic critics have described the orchestra as the most \"contemporary minded\", \"forward thinking\", \"talked about and innovative\", \"venturesome and admired\" orchestra in America. According to Salonen, \"We are interested in the future. We are not trying to re-create the glories of the past, like so many other symphony orchestras.\" \"Especially since we moved into the new hall,\" continues Deborah Borda (former CEO), \"our intention has been to integrate 21st-century music into the orchestra's everyday activity.\" Since the opening of the Walt Disney Concert Hall on October 23, 2003, the Los Angeles Philharmonic has presented 57 world premieres, one North American premiere, 26 U.S. premieres and has commissioned or co-commissioned 63 new works.\n\nThe orchestra was founded and single-handedly financed in 1919 by William Andrews Clark, Jr., a copper baron, arts enthusiast, and part-time violinist. He originally asked Sergei Rachmaninoff to be the Philharmonic's first music director; however, Rachmaninoff had only recently moved to New York, and he did not wish to move again. Clark then selected Walter Henry Rothwell, former assistant to Gustav Mahler, as music director, and hired away several principal musicians from East Coast orchestras and others from the competing and soon-to-be defunct Los Angeles Symphony. The orchestra played its first concert in the Trinity Auditorium in the same year, eleven days after its first rehearsal. Clark himself would sometimes sit and play with the second violin section.\n\nAfter Rothwell's death in 1927, subsequent Music Directors in the decade of the 1920s included Georg Schnéevoigt and Artur Rodziński.\n\nOtto Klemperer became Music Director in 1933, part of the large group of German emigrants fleeing Nazi Germany. He conducted many LA Phil premieres, and introduced Los Angeles audiences to important new works by Igor Stravinsky and Arnold Schoenberg. The orchestra responded well to his leadership, but Klemperer had a difficult time adjusting to Southern California, a situation exacerbated by repeated manic-depressive episodes.\n\nThings were further complicated when founder William Andrews Clark died without leaving the orchestra an endowment. The newly formed Southern California Symphony Association was created with the goal to stabilize the orchestra's funding, with the association's president, Harvey Mudd, stepping up to personally guarantee Klemperer's salary. The Philharmonic's concerts at the Hollywood Bowl also brought in much needed revenue. With that, the orchestra managed to make it through the worst of the Great Depression years still intact.\n\nThen, after completing the 1939 summer season at the Hollywood Bowl, Klemperer was visiting Boston and was incorrectly diagnosed with a brain tumor, and the subsequent brain surgery left him partially paralyzed. He went into a depressive state and was institutionalized. When he escaped, \"The New York Times\" ran a cover story declaring him missing. After he was found in New Jersey, a picture of him behind bars was printed in the \"New York Herald Tribune\". He subsequently lost the post of Music Director, though he still would occasionally conduct the Philharmonic. He led some important concerts, such as the orchestra's premiere performance of Stravinsky's \"Symphony in Three Movements\" in 1946.\n\nSir John Barbirolli was offered the position of Music Director after his contract with the New York Philharmonic expired in 1942. He declined the offer and chose to return to England instead. The following year, Alfred Wallenstein was chosen by Mudd to lead the orchestra. The former principal cellist of the New York Philharmonic, he had been the youngest member of the Los Angeles Philharmonic when it was founded in 1919. He turned to conducting at the suggestion of Arturo Toscanini. He had conducted the L.A. Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl on a number of occasions and, in 1943, took over as Music Director. Among the highlights of Wallenstein's tenure were recordings of concertos with fellow Angelenos, Jascha Heifetz and Arthur Rubinstein.\n\nBy the mid-1950s, department store heiress and wife of the publisher of the \"Los Angeles Times\", Dorothy Buffum Chandler became the de facto leader of the orchestra's board of directors. Besides leading efforts to create a performing arts center for the city that would serve as the Philharmonic's new home, and would eventually lead to the Los Angeles Music Center, she and others wanted a more prominent conductor to lead the orchestra; after Wallenstein's departure, Chandler led efforts to hire then Concertgebouw Orchestra principal conductor, Eduard van Beinum as the LAPO music director. The Philharmonic's musicians, management and audience all loved Beinum, but in 1959, he suffered a massive heart attack while on the podium during a rehearsal of the Concertgebouw Orchestra and died.\n\nIn 1960, the orchestra, led again by Chandler, signed Georg Solti to a three-year contract to be music director after he had guest conducted the orchestra in winter concerts downtown, at the Hollywood Bowl, and in other Southern California locations including CAMA concerts in Santa Barbara. Solti was to officially begin his tenure in 1962, and the Philharmonic had hoped that he would lead the orchestra when it moved into its new home at the then yet-to-be-completed Dorothy Chandler Pavilion; he even began to appoint musicians to the orchestra. However, Solti abruptly resigned the position in 1961 without officially taking the post after learning that the Philharmonic board of directors failed to consult him before naming then 26-year-old Zubin Mehta to be assistant conductor of the orchestra. Mehta was subsequently named to replace Solti.\n\nIn 1969, the orchestra hired Ernest Fleischmann to be Executive Vice President and General Manager. During his tenure, the Philharmonic instituted a number of then-revolutionary ideas, including the creation of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Chamber Music Society and the Los Angeles Philharmonic New Music Group and its \"Green Umbrella\" concerts; both of these adjunct groups were composed of the orchestra's musicians but offered performance series which were separate and distinct from traditional Philharmonic concerts. They were eventually imitated by other orchestras throughout the world. This concept was ahead of its time, and was an outgrowth of Fleischmann's philosophy, most famously laid out in his 16 May 1987 commencement address at the Cleveland Institute of Music entitled, \"The Orchestra is Dead. Long Live the Community of Musicians.\"\n\nWhen Zubin Mehta left for the New York Philharmonic in 1978, Fleischmann convinced Carlo Maria Giulini to take over as Music Director. Giulini's time with the orchestra was well regarded, however, he resigned the position after his wife became ill, and returned to Italy.\n\nIn 1985, Fleischmann turned to André Previn with the hopes that his conducting credentials and time spent at Hollywood Studios would add a local flair and enhance the connection between conductor, orchestra, and city. While Previn's tenure was musically satisfactory, other conductors including Kurt Sanderling, Simon Rattle, and Esa-Pekka Salonen, fared better at the box office. Previn clashed frequently with Fleischmann; one such conflict occurred over Fleischmann's failure to consult Previn over the decision to name Salonen as \"Principal Guest Conductor\", a move mirroring the prior Solti/Mehta controversy. Because of Previn's objections, the position and Japan tour offer made to Salonen were withdrawn; however, shortly thereafter in April 1989, Previn resigned, and four months later, Salonen was named Music Director Designate, officially taking the post in October 1992. Salonen's U.S. conducting debut with the orchestra had been in 1984.\n\nSalonen's tenure with the orchestra first began with a residency at the 1992 Salzburg Festival in concert performances and as the pit orchestra in a production of the opera \"Saint François d'Assise\" by Olivier Messiaen; it was the first time an American orchestra was given that opportunity. Salonen later took the orchestra on many other tours of the United States, Europe, and Asia, and residencies at the Lucerne Festival in Switzerland, The Proms in London, in Cologne for a festival of Salonen's own works, and in 1996 at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris for a Stravinsky festival conducted by Salonen and Pierre Boulez. It was during the Paris residency that key Philharmonic board members heard the orchestra perform in improved acoustics and were reinvigorated to lead fundraising efforts for the soon-to-be built Walt Disney Concert Hall.\n\nUnder Salonen's leadership, the Philharmonic has become an extremely progressive and well-regarded orchestra. Alex Ross of \"The New Yorker\" said:\nThe Salonen era in L.A. may mark a turning point in the recent history of classical music in America. It is a story not of an individual magically imprinting his personality on an institution—what Salonen has called the \"empty hype\" of conductor worship—but of an individual and an institution bringing out unforeseen capabilities in each other, and thereby proving how much life remains in the orchestra itself, at once the most conservative and the most powerful of musical organisms.\n\n... no American orchestra matches the L.A. Philharmonic in its ability to assimilate a huge range of music on a moment's notice. [Thomas] Adès, who first conducted his own music in L.A. [in 2005] and has become an annual visitor, told me, \"They always seem to begin by finding exactly the right playing style for each piece of music—the kind of sound, the kind of phrasing, breathing, attacks, colors, the indefinable whole. That shouldn't be unusual, but it is.\" John Adams calls the Philharmonic \"the most \"Amurrican\" of orchestras. They don't hold back and they don't put on airs. If you met them in twos or threes, you'd have no idea they were playing in an orchestra, that they were classical-music people.\"\n\nWhen Fleischmann decided to retire in 1998 after 28-years at the helm, the orchestra named Willem Wijnbergen as its new Executive Director. Wijnbergen, a Dutch pianist and arts administrator, was the managing director of the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam. Initially, his appointment was hailed as a major coup for the orchestra.\n\nOne of his most important decisions was to modify Hollywood Bowl programing: he increased the number of jazz concerts and appointed John Clayton serving as the orchestra's first Jazz Chair; in addition, he established a new World Music series with Tom Schnabel as programming director Despite some successes, Wijnbergen left the orchestra in 1999 after only one controversy-filled year, and it is unclear whether he resigned or was fired by the Philharmonic's board of directors.\n\nLater that same year, Deborah Borda, then the Executive Director of the New York Philharmonic, was hired to take over executive management of the orchestra. She began her tenure in January 2000, and was later given the title of President and Chief Executive Officer. After financial problems experienced during Wijnbergen's short tenure, Borda — \"a formidable executive who runs the orchestra like a lean company, not like a flabby non-profit\" — \"put the organization on solid financial footing.\" She is widely credited (along with Salonen, Frank Gehry, and Yasuhisa Toyota) for the orchestra's very successful move to Walt Disney Concert Hall, and for wholeheartedly supporting and complementing Salonen's artistic vision. One example cited by Alex Ross:\nPerhaps Borda's boldest notion is to give visiting composers such as [John] Adams and Thomas Adès the same royal treatment that is extended to the likes of Yo-Yo Ma and Joshua Bell; Borda talks about \"hero composers.\" A recent performance of Adams's monumental California symphony \"Naïve and Sentimental Music\" in the orchestra's Casual Fridays series ... drew a nearly full house. Borda's big-guns approach has invigorated the orchestra's long-running new-music series, called Green Umbrella, which Fleischmann established in 1982. In the early days, it drew modest audiences, but in recent years attendance has risen to the point where as many as sixteen hundred people show up for a concert that in other cities might draw thirty or forty. The Australian composer Brett Dean recently walked onstage for a Green Umbrella concert and did a double take, saying that it was the largest new-music audience he'd ever seen.\n\nOn July 13, 2005, a young Venezuelan conductor, Gustavo Dudamel, made his debut with the LA Phil at the orchestra's summer home, the Hollywood Bowl. In his U.S. debut Tuesday night, a 24-year-old conductor from Venezuela with curly hair, long sideburns and a baby face accomplished something increasingly rare and difficult at the Hollywood Bowl. He got a normally restive audience's full, immediate and rapt attention. And he kept it.\n\nOn January 4, 2007, Dudamel made his Walt Disney Concert Hall debut with the LA Phil prompting Los Angeles Times critic Mark Swed to write, \"Greatness like this doesn't come around often.\" A few months later, on April 9, 2007, the symphony board announced that Esa-Pekka Salonen would step down as the LAP's music director at the end of the 2008–2009 season, and Gustavo Dudamel would succeed him. In 2007, two years before Dudamel's official start as music director, the LA Phil established YOLA (Youth Orchestra Los Angeles). \"The model for YOLA – a nonprofit initiative that supplies underprivileged children with free instruments, instruction, and profound lessons about pride, community, and commitment – is El Sistema, Venezuela's national music training program which, 27 years ago, nurtured the talents of a 5-year-old violin prodigy named Gustavo.\" Just before the beginning of his inaugural season with the LA Phil, Dudamel, on May 11, 2009, was included as a finalist in \"Time\"'s \"The Time 100: The World's Most Influential People.\"\n\nGustavo Dudamel began his official tenure as music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 2009 with concerts at both the Hollywood Bowl (¡Bienvenido Gustavo!) on October 3, 2009 and the Inaugural Gala at Walt Disney Concert Hall on October 8, 2009. In 2010 and 2011 Dudamel and the LA Phil received the Morton Gould Award for Innovative Programming by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP). In 2012, Dudamel and the orchestra won the first place Award for Programming Contemporary Music by ASCAP. In 2012, Dudamel, the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela performed all nine of Mahler's symphonies over the course of three weeks in Los Angeles and one week in Caracas, \"a mammoth tribute to the composer,\" and \"an unprecedented conducting feat for the conductor.\" That same year, the orchestra launched a three-year project to present the Mozart/Da Ponte operas, each designed in collaboration with famous architects (sets) and clothing designers (costumes). The series launched in 2012 with Frank Gehry and Rodarte designing Don Giovanni and continued in 2013 with Jean Nouvel and Azzedine Alaïa designing Le Nozze di Figaro. In October 2011, Dudamel was named Gramophone Artist of the Year. In 2012, Dudamel and the LA Phil were awarded a Grammy award for Best Orchestral Performance for their recording of Brahms' Fourth Symphony. Dudamel was also named Musical America's 2013 Musician of the Year. The LA Phil's continued commitment to innovation and new music under the direction of Dudamel and Borda prompted New Yorker critic Alex Ross to name the LA Phil \"the most creative, and, therefore, the best orchestra in America.\" In 2017, Zachary Woolfe, classical music editor at the New York Times called the Los Angeles Philharmonic \"the most important orchestra in America. Period.\" \n\nThe orchestra played its first season at Trinity Auditorium at Grand Ave and Ninth Street. In 1920, it moved to Fifth Street and Olive Ave, in a venue that had previously been known as Clune's Auditorium, but was renamed Philharmonic Auditorium. From 1964 to 2003, the orchestra played its main subscription concerts in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Los Angeles Music Center. In 2003, it moved to the new Walt Disney Concert Hall designed by Frank Gehry adjacent to the Chandler. Its current \"winter season\" runs from October through late May or early June.\n\nSince 1922, the orchestra has played outdoor concerts during the summer at the Hollywood Bowl, with the official \"summer season\" running from July through September.\n\nThe LA Philharmonic has played at least one concert a year in its sister city, Santa Barbara, presented by the Community Arts Music Association (CAMA), along with other regular concerts throughout various Southern California cities such as Costa Mesa as part of the Orange County Philharmonic Society's series, San Diego, Palm Springs, among many others. In addition, the orchestra plays a number of free community concerts throughout Los Angeles County.\n\nGeorg Solti accepted the post in 1960, but resigned in 1961 without officially beginning his tenure.\n\n\nBefore Salonen's last concert as Music Director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic on April 19, 2009, the orchestra announced his appointment as its first ever \"Conductor Laureate\" \"as acknowledgement of our profound gratitude to him and to signify our continuing connection.\" In response, Salonen said:\n\"When the Board asked me if I would accept the position of Conductor Laureate I was overwhelmed. This organization has been at the very center of my musical life for 17 years. I am very proud and honored that they would even consider me for such a prestigious title and it gives me great pleasure to accept. The Los Angeles Philharmonic will always play an important role in my life and this is a symbol of our continuing relationship.\" \n\nRattle and Tilson Thomas were named Principal Guest Conductor concurrently under Carlo Maria Giulini, though Tilson Thomas's tenure ended much earlier. Until 2016, they were the only two conductors to officially hold the title as such (though as stated above, Esa-Pekka Salonen was initially offered the position under Previn before having the offer withdrawn).\n\nBeginning in the Summer of 2005, the Philharmonic created the new position of \"Principal Guest Conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl\". Leonard Slatkin was initially given a two-year contract, and in 2007 he was given a one-year extension. In March 2008, Bramwell Tovey was named to the post for an initial two-year contract beginning Summer of 2008; he subsequently received a one-year extension. After Tovey's term ended, no conductor has since held the position at the Hollywood Bowl.\n\nIn April 2016, the LA Phil announced that Susanna Mälkki would be the orchestra's third-ever Principal Guest Conductor beginning with the 2017-18 season. Her initial contract is for three years.\n\nOther conductors with whom the orchestra has had close ties include Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter, Leopold Stokowski, Albert Coates, Fritz Reiner, and Erich Leinsdorf; more recently, others have included Kurt Sanderling, Pierre Boulez, Leonard Bernstein, Charles Dutoit, Christoph Eschenbach, and Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos.\n\nMany composers have conducted the Philharmonic in concerts and/or world premieres of their works, including Igor Stravinsky, William Kraft, John Harbison, Witold Lutosławski, Aaron Copland, Pierre Boulez, Steven Stucky, John Williams, Jerry Goldsmith, John Adams, Thomas Adès, and Esa-Pekka Salonen.\n\nA number of the Philharmonic's Assistant/Associate Conductors have gone on to have notable careers in their own rights. These include Lawrence Foster, Calvin E. Simmons, and William Kraft under Mehta, Sidney Harth and Myung-whun Chung under Giulini, Heiichiro Ohyama and David Alan Miller under Previn, and Grant Gershon, Miguel Harth-Bedoya, Kristjan Järvi, and Alexander Mickelthwate under Salonen. Lionel Bringuier was originally named Assistant Conductor under Salonen before being promoted to Associate Conductor and, finally, Resident Conductor under Dudamel; since then, Mirga Gražinytė-Tyla has served as Assistant Conductor and Associate Conductor under Dudamel.\n\n\nKraft and Harbison held the title \"Composer-in-Residence\" as part of a Meet the Composer (MTC) sponsorship. Steiger was given the title \"Composer-Fellow\", serving as an assistant to both Harbison and Stucky.\n\nStucky was also a MTC \"Composer-in-Residence\" from 1988–1992, but was kept on as \"New Music Advisor\" after his official MTC-sponsored tenure ended; in 2000, his title was again changed to \"Consulting Composer for New Music.\" In the end, his 21-year residency with the orchestra was the longest such relationship of any composer with an American orchestra.\n\nAdams has been named the orchestra's \"Creative Chair\" beginning in Fall 2009.\n\n\nReeves was named the first \"Creative Chair for Jazz\" in March 2002. Instead of just focusing on summer programming, the new position involved the scheduling of jazz programming and educational workshops year round; as such, she led the development of the subscription jazz series the orchestra offered when it moved into Walt Disney Concert Hall. In addition, she was the first performer at the 2003 inaugural gala at the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Her contract was initially for two years, and was subsequently renewed for an additional two years.\n\nMcBride took over the position in 2006 for an initial two-year position that was subsequently renewed for an additional two years through to the start of the 2010 summer season at the Hollywood Bowl. In 2009, the orchestra introduced Hancock as McBride's eventual replacement.\n\nIn 1998, prior to the establishment of the Creative Chair for Jazz, John Clayton was given the title \"Artistic Director of Jazz\" at the Hollywood Bowl for a three-year term beginning with the 1999 summer season. His band, the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra, acted as the resident jazz ensemble.\n\nThe orchestra occasionally made 78-rpm recordings and LPs in the early years with Alfred Wallenstein and Leopold Stokowski for Capitol Records, and began recording regularly in the 1960s, for London/Decca, during the tenure of Zubin Mehta as music director. A healthy discography continued to grow with Carlo Maria Giulini on Deutsche Grammophon and André Previn on both Philips and Telarc Records. Michael Tilson Thomas, Leonard Bernstein, and Sir Simon Rattle also made several recordings with the orchestra in the 1980s, adding to their rising international profile. In recent years, Esa-Pekka Salonen has led recording sessions for Sony and Deutsche Grammophon. A recording of the \"Concerto for Orchestra\" by Béla Bartók released by Deutsche Grammophon in 2007 was the first recording by Gustavo Dudamel conducting the LA Phil.\n\nThe Los Angeles Philharmonic performed the music in the pilot film of the television series \"Battlestar Galactica\", composed by Stu Phillips and Glen A. Larson. The LA Philharmonic also performed the first North American concert for the popular \"Final Fantasy\" franchise game music, \"Dear Friends: Music From Final Fantasy\" by Nobuo Uematsu. The orchestra has most recently recorded the sound track for the video game: \"BioShock 2\" as composed by Garry Schyman.\n\n\n"}

Chess sets were originally made for export to Europe but the pattern of the pieces follows traditional Makonde designs rather than any established chess pattern.\n\nThe European market for Makonde art developed from the 1930s through Portuguese colonization. Chess sets were first exported by Norman Kirk, a New Zealander who owned a lime and cashew nut plantation in Tanzania (then Tanganyika). Kirk had been impressed by the work of the Makonde artist Likenikeni Sabini after visiting his workshop at Ndanda mission in the 1950s. After this visit he began buying and exporting Makonde art to Europe. Kirk enticed Sabini to come and work for him at his plantation where Sabini trained other carvers for Kirk. At some point Kirk initiated production of chess sets and the product became popular in the 1960s. The pieces in the chess set were based on the \"chidiu\", a traditional bottle stopper. This took the form of a human head with Makonde facial scarification.\n\nAfter Kirk's death in 1969 a group of carvers who had formerly supplied Kirk continued to carve chess sets. This group was centred on the village of Ziwani near Mtwara. Several new themes were developed by this group including the \"seated smoker\" set, the \"drummer\" set, and the \"bird\" set. Scarification marks tend to be omitted on modern pieces.\n\nThe king (\"bulisa\"), as the tallest piece, has a very tall African tribal hat worn by tribal chiefs. Alternatively, the hat may be a fez of the type formerly worn by colonial police and soldiers. The king always has this hat even in sets which do not take human form. The queen, as representative of women (\"nkongwe\"), carries a water pot on her head which is the custom in rural Africa. The knight is in the style of a giraffe (\"twiga\"); horses were unknown to the tribe as they cannot survive in this part of Africa because of the tsetse fly. Among the best of Makonde skills are carvings of animals. As there were no castles in Makonde territory, they designed the rook in the shape of a grain store representative of the importance of a good grain harvest, or sometimes as a tribal hut (\"ng'ande\"). Both of these represented security. The bishop (\"chikopa\") has a traditional bishop’s mitre headgear (possibly due to European influence) but without the facial scarification of the other characters. In some carvings the bishop appears as a witch doctor (native to 19th century east African culture). The pawn is carved in the style of a hard working Makonde tribesman, like the sculptor himself.\n\nMakonde chess sets are usually carved from african blackwood, known as \"mpingo\" (the black pieces) and a kind of rosewood (the white pieces). Chess sets of this style are still carved in Tanzania and Mozambique.\n\n\n"}

It was the first sitcom broadcast on a network television in the United States. \"Mary Kay and Johnny\" initially aired live on the DuMont Television Network before moving to CBS and then NBC.\n\nPlots centered around a bank employee and his \"zany, but not dumb\" wife and the problems that they encountered. Much of the activity occurred in the couple's apartment in Greenwich Village.\n\nA review in the March 6, 1948, issue of the trade publication \"Billboard\" began, \"This program comes close to being a model tele[vision] show. In detailing the adventures, mainly domestic, of a young married couple, Johnny and Mary Kay Stearns have come up with charming and fresh material, which always takes into consideration that there are cameras taking everything in.\" Later in the review, however, the author wrote, \"At times the show got just a bit too cute\" with the female star squealing too much and the story falling into familiar family sitcom patterns.\n\nIn addition to the Stearnses, the cast included their son, Christopher Stearns, as himself. Mary Kay's mother was played by Nydia Westman, and Johnny's friend Howie was played by Howard Thomas. Jim Stevenson was the announcer. \n\nThe first 15-minute episode debuted on the DuMont Television Network on Tuesday, November 18, 1947. The Stearnses created and wrote all the scripts. The program was broadcast live, most of the action taking place on a set representing the New York City apartment of the title characters, a young married couple. \n\n\"Mary Kay and Johnny\" was the first program to show a couple sharing a bed, and the first series to show a woman's pregnancy on television: Mary Kay became pregnant in 1948 and after unsuccessfully trying to hide her pregnancy, the producers wrote it into the show. On December 31, 1948, the Stearns' weeks-old son Christopher appeared on the show and became a character.\n\nAfter a year on DuMont, the show moved to CBS for half a year, much of the time being broadcast every weeknight, then ran for another year each Saturday night on NBC, where it debuted on October 10, 1948. It broadcast the final episode on March 11, 1950.\n\nAt a time when there were no TV ratings (the A.C. Nielsen Company would not begin measuring TV ratings until 1950), Anacin decided to take a chance and sponsor the show. This decision worried the advertising executives at Anacin, who thought that they might be wasting money by sponsoring a show with a sparse audience. A simple, non-scientific scheme to gauge the size of the audience was hatched. During one commercial spot, Anacin offered a free pocket mirror to the first 200 viewers who wrote in requesting one. As a precaution, they purchased a total of 400 mirrors in case the audience was twice as large as they expected. Although the free mirror was offered only during that one spot, Anacin received nearly 9000 requests for mirrors.\n\nBefore 1948, \"Mary Kay and Johnny\" was broadcast live and not recorded. In early 1948, still broadcast live, the show was also recorded on kinescopes so that it could be shown, with some delay, on the West Coast. The entire series from then until 1950 was recorded in this way. Many episodes survived in full as late as 1975, when DuMont's corporate successor, Metromedia, disposed of what was left of the DuMont archive in the East River.\n\nThe fate of the NBC episodes is unknown. Fragments of the show's last few episodes survive, most on 16-mm film; these are not commercially available, though TV Land used a clip in an episode of \"Inside TV Land\" called \"Taboo TV\".\n\nThe Paley Center for Media has one 1949 episode in its collection.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1291050", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1291050", "title": "Mystery Spot", "text": "Mystery Spot\n\nThe Mystery Spot is a visual illusion–based tourist attraction near Santa Cruz, California, opened in 1939 by George Prather. Visitors experience demonstrations that appear to defy gravity, on the short but steep uphill walk and inside a wooden building on the site. The Mystery Spot is a popular tourist attraction, and gained recognition as a roadside \"gravity box\" or \"tilted house\" illusion. At this roadside attraction, the laws of gravity and physics seem to disappear as balls roll uphill and people lean over past their toes without tumbling over.\n\nThe Mystery Spot was first discovered by George Prather in 1939. George Prather was an electrician, mechanic, and inventor before he opened the site. He was born near Fresno and moved to Santa Cruz in 1920. He owned a welding shop and repair garage in the area before he discovered the Mystery Spot. The Mystery Spot was one of several roadside attractions that opened after World War II for new automobile owners and was featured on Art Baker's television show \"You Asked For It\".\n\nPrather was inspired to open the site by the popularity of the nearby Oregon Vortex which opened to the public in 1930. According to a newspaper report, Prather bought 3 acres on the hill in 1940 after he felt slightly dizzy while walking and was interested in his dizziness. The newspaper also reported that during further exploration of his property he found his compass jittering and he then built his \"crazy house\" and opened the site to the public in June 1941, where tour guides lead visitors through the Mystery Spot on a daily basis. The site is what is known as a gravity hill and was the first of its kind to be built in California. The guides perform various demonstrations to showcase the unusual phenomena that Prather stumbled upon.\n\nPrather died in the month of January during 1946 and at that time his son Bruce inherited the land and continued running The Mystery Spot with his father's business partner Vaden McCray until his own passing in 2015. The McCray family was photographed for the \"Life\" magazine spread on the Mystery spot for their November 15, 1948 issue. McCray died in 2001 before Bruce Prather. An unnamed Santa Cruz lawyer now owns the property. The Mystery Spot was nominated in July 2014 to be designated as a California Historical landmark and was officially declared as California Historical Landmark #1055 in August 2014.\n\nThe site is located in Santa Cruz, California amongst the Santa Cruz mountains, Oak trees, Eucalyptus trees, near Granite Creek, and within the California Redwood forest. The Mystery Spot is between the Santa Cruz Mountains and the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, popular tourist spots. The Redwood trees in this area grow crookedly and are a part of what is known as the Twisted Grove in Nisene Marks State Park. The Mystery Spot can be found on Highway 17 along the way to the Santa Cruz Mountains. The Mystery Spot is home to a man-made dahlia garden along the hiking trail.\n\nThe Mystery Spot is a gravity hill, tilt-induced visual illusion. The illusion experienced by visitors results from the oddly tilted environment as well as standing on a tilted floor. Inside the tilted room of the Mystery Spot, misperceptions of the height and orientation of objects occur. Even when people are standing outside on a level ground, the slant of the building in the background causes misperceptions as humans judge the height of people using the slant of the roof rather than the true horizon.\n\nThese visual illusions include balls rolling uphill and people leaning farther than normally possible without falling down. Psychologists at Berkeley state that all of the misperceptions stem from the simple fact that the house is slanted at a 20 degree angle. Professor William Prinzmetal states, “When the perceiver's body also is tilted, the distorting impact on vision is greatly magnified- up to two or three times.” Another point he makes is that distorted orientation causes other senses to fall back while your visual senses become heightened. People standing at impossible angles and water flowing uphill are related to the angle at which the house sits on.\n\nOther suggestions have been proposed to explain the reason behind The Mystery Spot’s odd gravitational rules and illusions. Tour guides suggest that “a meteor which fell in ancient days and left a magic circle” is the cause behind the mystery, and suggest that an electromagnetic field on the hill deters wildlife. These are theories proposed by guides for entertainment, and not scientific reasoning.\n\nThe Mystery Spot is open for tours 365 days a year. Aside from the attraction itself, there is a thirty-minute hiking trail nearby.\n\nThe Mystery Spot was the first 'gravity-defying' tourist attraction in California and was the most prominent illusion-based tourist attraction in California in the mid-20th century. The Mystery Spot has been featured on Buzzfeed, the Santa Cruz Sentinel, comic strips, travel blogs, and newspapers for decades.\n\n"}

Who is it that needs to be warned?'\" Part of the reason for this practice may be the breaking of a taboo for some audience members to see bodies in many conditions performing on stage, an event that may create astonishment, among other reactions. Audiences in Western cultures are accustomed to seeing only dancers in peak physical condition when they attend performances at top theatres. Integrated or inclusive dance also must rise to the artistic challenges that face any dance performance.\n\nModern integrated or inclusive dance was first explored during the late 1960s. Dance instructor Hilde Holger taught dance to her son, who had Down Syndrome, and went on to stage a performance that included intellectually disabled dancers at Sadler's Wells in 1968. Among Holger's students was Wolfgang Stange, who was inspired to found a company to perform integrated dance works, the Amici Dance Theatre Company. Integrated dance gained a higher profile with the mainstream public during the 1980s. In 1986, DV8 Physical Theatre was founded in London, England, and in 1987, the AXIS Dance Company was founded in California. A number of other dance companies around the world now perform with physically or mentally disabled dancers.\n\nThere are also companies that are founded or led by people who identify as disabled, and disabled choreographers, many of whom challenge conceptions of 'dance', 'stage,' and 'artistry' in their work. Examples include Kim Manri (Taihen), Gerda Koenig (DIN A 13), Petra Kuppers (The Olimpias), Raimund Hoghe, Claire Cunningham, Neil Marcus, Bill Shannon and Marc Brew.\n\nSome physically integrated dance companies are:\n\nAXIS Dance Company is a professional contemporary dance company and dance education organization based in Oakland, California. It was founded in 1987 and was one of the first contemporary dance companies in the world to consciously develop choreography that integrates dancers with and without physical disabilities. Their work has received seven Isadora Duncan Dance Awards and nine additional nominations for both their artistry and production values.\n\nCandoco Dance Company is a British contemporary dance company of disabled and non-disabled dancers, founded in 1991 by Celeste Dandeker and Adam Benjamin. Dandeker, who had previously trained with the London Contemporary Dance Theatre, suffered a fall whilst dancing on stage.\nThe resulting spinal injury prevented her from dancing until choreographer Darshan Singh Buller persuaded her to dance again, albeit from her wheelchair, for the subsequently award-winning dance film \"The Fall\".\nFrom this, Dandeker took inspiration to create Candoco Dance Company, which, since its inception, has been creating an inclusive dance practice.\n\nThe Dancing Wheels Company is a professional dance company based in Cleveland, Ohio. Founded in 1980, it was the first in America to stage performances involving dancers with and without disabilities. The company uses its performances to enhance public awareness of disability issues and promote social change.\n\nDV8 Physical Theatre was formed in 1986 by an independent collective of British dancers who, they claim, had become frustrated and disillusioned with the preoccupation and direction of most dance. The company has produced 16 dance pieces, which have toured internationally, and 4 award-winning films for television. They are performing works that break down the barriers between dance, theatre, and personal politics and, above all, communicate ideas and feelings clearly and unpretentiously. Dancers and production staff include people with disabilities, for example in the company's film \"The Cost of Living\".\n\nFull Radius Dance is an American company based in Atlanta, Georgia composed of professional dancers with and without physical disabilities.\n\nThe GIMP Project is a New-York based modern dance project by the Heidi Latsky Dance company.\n\nIndepen-dance is a Scottish inclusive dance organisation founded in 1996 by Karen Anderson. Based in Glasgow the organisation is primarily based around the delivery of weekly classes and a service provider for learning disabled dancers and their carers. The organisation also runs three performing companies - Adult Performance Company, Young1'z and Indepen-dance 4. \n\nRemix Dance Project is a South African contemporary dance company that \"brings together performers with physical disabilities and performers without.\" It concentrates on the contemporary dance genre, with its activities focused on education and the creation of \"performances that are intriguing and intelligent\".\n\nRestless Dance Theatre is a physically integrated dance company based in Adelaide, Australia. The company has three core areas of activity: a community workshop program for small children with intellectual disability, a core performance group of 15- to 26-year-olds with and without disabilities who work in collaboration with professional artists and a touring company of professional dancers.\n\nThe Amici Dance Theatre Company, founded by Wolfgang Stange in 1980 and based in London, UK, includes dancers with physical and also mental disabilities.

It was the meeting place of Chaplain Brown GAR Post No. 106, one of 592 GAR posts in Indiana. Designed in 1892 by a local architect, Charles F. Lembke., using Romanesque styling, it was built in 1892-3 to seat 100 people. It was also used as the local opera house.\n\nLocal legend says that Wm Jennings Bryan spoke at the hall during the 1896 presidential campaign. Others who have been to the hall include Theodore Roosevelt, John Phillips Sousa, Marx Brothers. Decline began with the advent of the movies, for which it was converted. By the time of World War II it was an abandoned building. Beginning in 1955, the Community Theatre Guild leased the property and began maintaining it once again for theater productions, continuing to do so under a lease agreement with Porter County until the county again took full possession in the late 1990s to facilitate structural renovation and restoration. The Board of Commissioners for Porter County, who manage and maintain the structure, restored the hall in 1998, and established a new community theatre troupe and public management for touring productions, allowing the building to continue to be used as a theatrical and assembly facility as originally intended.\n\nThe Memorial Opera House is located at 104 Indiana Avenue just east of the historic Porter County Jail and Sheriff's House. At the time of construction, Indiana Avenue was called Mechanics Street. The Opera House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. It was restored in 1998.Today, the Memorial Theatre Company produces six theatrical performances each year and host community concerts and other events. p\n\nThe 1893 Memorial Opera House is \"eclectic\" in its styling, with the details, symmetry, and size associated with the Queen Anne style. Additional influences are seen in the broad entrance arches and side windows. This may reflect the influence of Louis Sullivan or H. H. Richardson, both active in nearby Chicago during this time.\n\nThe main facade features a projecting, two-story central bay, with a jerkin-head gable. The ground floor of the bay is occupied by a broad, low-springing arch, formed by seven header courses of brick with rock-face limestone springers. The main entrance consists of two pairs of multi-light doors. Eight radiating lights fill the tympanum. \nAbove the entrance is a recessed panel on a stone sill with the inscription, \"1883, Memorial Hall, A monument to the Soldiers and Sailors of 1861-5.\" Above the dedication stone is a limestone sill and a fanlight with clear and stained glass set in a seven-course brick arch. A coved verge board outlines the edge of the jerkin-head gable, and is decorated by rosettes.\nOn both sides of the central bay there are a single bay. At ground level, the windows are segmentally arched double-hung, with stone sills level with the springers of the central arch. Above, the double-hung windows have stone sills, and a stone belt course, serving as the lintels. A parapet with rounded \"shoulders,\" on a stone cornice of corbelled brick.\nTwo round towers frame the main facade. Rectangular windows have a stringcourse forming the sills, in line-with the central arch springers. A rock-faced belt course forming the lintels. Decorative brick detailing above the windows forms a foundation for a floriated frieze, with a modillioned cornice.\nTwo-story structure has a pitched roof, interrupted by hipped roofs over projecting bays. Round-arched windows on each side, replicate the main façade. Shallow buttresses, interrupt the wall surface\n\nThe interior retains the orchestra pit and side boxes. The boxes are framed by turned posts, and the appliqué decorated railings. Latticework, similar to that used in Queen Anne houses, connects the posts across the top. A new floor with modern seating was installed in 1967, along with improvements to the orchestra pit. The improvement cost about $250,000.\n\nThe idea of building a memorial hall was started by the Chaplain Brown Post of the Grand Army of the Republic. They held a public subscription drive to secure the funds. The county Commissioners provided a lot and additional funds. Once open in 1893, the G.A.R. held patriotic rallies, concerts, and lectures in the building, but were unable to cover the Post's debts and operating costs. In 1901 the County assumed the debts and control of the building.\nIn 1901, the building was leased to Albert F. Heineman. He provided brought in entertains for the city, including minstrel troupes, traveling theatrical companies, political figures, and vaudeville. William Jennings Bryan is said to have given his \"Cross of Gold and Crown of Thorns\" speech here, two years before the Chicago nominating convention in 1896, and Theodore Roosevelt appeared in 1900, while campaigning William McKinley as the Vice Presidential nominee.\n\nLive performances were the mainstay at the Opera House until the 1920s. Then, movies began to compete with and soon replace live performances. Some films and performances by local groups shared the stage during the 1920s, 30's and 40's. The Opera House was vacant as much as it was in use. In the 1950s demolition was being considered. In 1957 the Community Theatre Guild was formed with the express purpose the renovation and preservation of the Opera House.\nThe Guild arranged a lease from the County Commissioners, and began making repairs and creating a stage for local talent. Work peaked in 1967, when a $250,000 renovation project was undertaken. The Guild continues to operate at the nearby Chicago Street Theatre, located several blocks north of the Opera House, but vacated the Opera House in the mid-1990s when a multi-million dollar renovation and restoration was undertaken by the county.

Those two separate academies merged in 1993 to form Berlin's present-day Academy of Arts.\n\nMost artists were associated with the academy as members. Membership was an honorary distinction extended to prominent domestic Prussian artists (after unification, German artists) and selected foreign figures as well. A 'deliberative' body of senators was chosen from the membership – some elected, and some automatically included due to other rank. \n\nThe academy was not a school, although it had associations with educational institutions, notably the state school that evolved into the present-day Berlin University of the Arts. \n\n\nThe academy was founded to include painters, sculptors, and architects as members, reflecting the classical unity of the arts ideal. The scope was expanded in 1704 to include \"Mechanical Sciences\". The academy's first director (president) was Swiss painter Joseph Werner. \n\nName changes: \n\n\nLongtime director and sculptor Johann Gottfried Schadow served from 1815 to 1850. In 1833 the academy added a fine arts division, and a music division in 1835. \n\nEmil Fuchs studied at the Academy under Fritz Schaper and Anton von Werner, shortly before 1891. Otto Geyer studied there from 1859–1864. Sculptor Wilhelm Neumann-Torborg studied at the academy from 1878 until 1885, under Otto Knille and Fritz Schaper. In 1885, he won the Academy's Rome Scholarship for his thesis, \"The Judgment of Paris\". Anna Gerresheim studied there from 1876 for four years in the \"ladies class\" under Karl Gussow. Oskar Frenzel studied there between 1884 and 1889 under Paul Friedrich Meyerheim and Eugen Bracht. He was from 1904 until his death a member of the Academy. Painter Friedrich Wachenhusen studied there in 1889 under Eugen Bracht.\n\nName changes: \n\n\nIn 1926 the academy added a \"Dichtkunst\" (Fine Poetry) division, a \"Dichtung\" (Poetry) division in 1932, and the German Academy of Poetry from the beginning of June 1933. \n\nPainter and sculptor Paul Wallat studied there from 1902–1909 under (de) (1835–1904) and Carl Saltzmann. On December 29, 1906 he received the award of the \"Ginsberg Foundation\" of the Berlin Academy. In 1920, Käthe Kollwitz became the first woman elected to the Prussian Academy, but with the coming to power of Adolf Hitler in 1933 she was expelled because of her beliefs and her art.\n\nName changes: \n\n"}

In the magazine \"Contemporary\", Brandon Labelle wrote: \"Working as an artist, writer, curator, professor, lecturer and critic over the last 20 years, Jones is a self-styled Conceptualist, spanning the worlds of academia and art, opera and garden design, and acting as paternal spearhead of contemporary critical practice. Explorative and provocative, Jones creates work that demands attention that is both perceptual and political.\" Labelle positions Jones along the leading edge of a \"contemporary critical practice\" that is perhaps best described as interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary.\n\nJones graduated in 1974, with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Montomery, Alabama's Huntingdon College. He completed an MFA degree in sculpture from the University of South Carolina, followed by a Ph.D. in Interdisciplinary Arts at Ohio University where he wrote about a collaboration between Samuel Beckett and Marcel Duchamp. In 1983, he was included in a group exhibition titled \"A Likely Story,\" at Artists space in New York City which was curated by Valerie Smith and included Gretchen Bender, David Cabrera, and Jeff Koons. In 1985 he moved to New York City and two years later had his first solo exhibition at Metro Pictures Gallery. In the \"New York Times\", Roberta Smith wrote: \"Mr. Jones's main goal seems to be to thwart the eye with formal incoherence and an overload of written information that the mind must digest before his pieces make sense. But the sense made is never visual. Instead, if one wades through the long illustrated paragraph that constitutes each work's title, learning the artwork or event that each component represents, a kind of odd and often frightening poetic logic accrues.\"\nJones is represented by Metro Pictures Gallery where his last of six solo shows was in 1998. \nJones began his curatorial practice in 1986, when he assembled The Public Art Show with a catalog designed by Louise Lawler and a poster by Barbara Kruger. He went on to organize eleven exhibitions for New York City galleries (Metro Pictures, Lehmann Maupin and Josh Baer) and European and Scandinaviany institutions (\"Dark Side of the Moon,\" Stockholm Cultural Capital of Europe Arkipelag project, 1998 and Magasin 3 Projekt Djurgårdsbrunn, 2003).\n\nIn 1987, he began writing criticism for \"Arts Magazine\" and \"Artscribe\". Soon after, he began contributing articles, essays and reviews to \"Frieze\", \"Artforum\", \"Bookforum\", \"Art in America\", \"Parkett\", \"Cabinet\", \"Zone\" and others. Jones wrote numerous catalogs for other artists including Elizabeth Peyton,\nLaurie Simmons, David Salle, Terry Winters, Richard Phillips, Carroll Dunham, and Keith Edmier.\n\nIn 1989 Jones was invited to join the faculty at the School of Art, Yale University as Critic in Sculpture and ultimately was named Senior Critic.\n\nIn 1992 Jones served as the spokesman for the National Endowment of the Arts peer-review panel for fellowships in sculpture, which launched one of many high-profile national debates on censorship and First Amendment issues in the arts. Jones later served on a think-tank at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University which considered the future of culture in the United States in light of a diminished National Endowment of the Arts.\n\nIn 1993 he had a solo exhibition at the Sonnabend Gallery in New York City. As his work continued to be exhibited internationally (including solo exhibitions in Berlin, Tokyo, Los Angeles, Paris, and Cologne) Jones was commissioned to design garden projects including Pritzker Park in Chicago, the Rethymnon Centre of Contemporary Art in Crete, the Botanical Gardens in Curitiba, Brazil, Caesar’s Cosmic Garden Boras Konstmuseet, Sweden and a garden for the city of Hamburg, Germany among others.\n\nIn 1995, ArtForum magazine's \"Best and Worst 1995\" article stated that Jones should be \"a nominee for a lifetime achievement award for contemporary-art awfulness.\"\n\nIn 1998 he was appointed professor and Chairman of the Visual Arts Department at Columbia University. At Columbia he was the Director of the Digital Media Center and Co-Director of the Interactive Design Lab. While at Columbia he served on the faculty of the MA Colloquia in the Masters Program in Critical Studies, Department of Art History and Archeology and taught in seminars at The Computer Music Department.He continued to serve as a Visiting Professor at Konstfack, University College of Arts, Crafts and Design, in Stockholm, Sweden, which he had done since 1996.

The film was selected as the Romanian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 41st Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee. \n\nThe action starts near the end of Trajan's Dacian Wars (106 AD), when south western Dacia was transformed into a Roman province: Roman Dacia. It covers the years after the war, including the beginnings of the Romanization and Romanian ethnogenesis, the construction of Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa, resistance of the Free Dacians and first barbarian invasions.\n\nAs the Romans under Trajan take the Dacian capital Sarmizegetusa, the Dacian king Decebalus and his closest followers are forced to retreat. Trajan takes command of the city and orders one of his officers, Tiberius, to pursue the defeated king. In a cave, Decebalus broods on his defeat, and tells his devoted supporter Gerula that the Dacian people must continue to resist. Tiberius and his men catch up with Decebalus and Gerula. Decebalus kills himself to avoid capture. To Gerula's horror, Tiberius chops off Decebalus' head and right hand as trophies to take back to Trajan. While they are returning to the Roman camp Gerula escapes. He gathers together a group of Dacians and takes them to a part of the land not yet under Roman control.\n\nAt Sarmizegetusa, Trajan orders Tiberius to remain in Dacia and preside over the Romanisation of the territory, building fortifications, victory monuments and Roman settlements. Tiberius initially meets resistance from the local people, but wins over influential local chief Ciungu when he shows clemency to his rebellious son. One of the Roman centurions, Sabinus, falls in love with a local woman, a devotee of the Dacian god Zalmoxis. They become lovers. \n\nThe Romans seem to be building a successful community, but nearby, in a secret location, Gerula is training up free Dacians, including Decebalus's grandson, to launch a new campaign to destroy the Romans and restore the Dacian kingdom. Sabinus accidentally discovers the free Dacian camp, and a clash occurs, during which Gerula slashes Sabinus' face, blinding him. Andrada, an aristocratic Dacian woman who has killed a Roman soldier, is brought back to the camp. Again Tiberius shows clemency. He also tries to woo Andrada, who rejects him. Eventually, after a period of distrust, Tiberius wins over Andrada, and the couple are married. Tiberius tells Ciungu that he intends to build a town, and use Roman technology to improve the lives of the Dacian people. Andrada gives birth to her first child with Tiberius, a boy. He proudly shows the baby to the community, to cheers from both Romans and Dacians.\n\nYears later, Tiberius has built up the settlement into a Roman town. Trajan sends a Roman official to legally declare it to be a municipality. During the ceremony the official is killed by an arrow — shot by one of Gerula's men. The colony nevertheless prospers. The blinded Sabinus becomes the local schoolteacher, instructing the children in Roman culture. Andrada, however, also passes on Dacian lore and stories of pre-Roman times to her son. Decebalus's grandson is now fully grown, becoming the potential new king Gerula wants him to be. Gerula decides it is time to launch the war of liberation against the Romans and their collaborators. A shipment of mined gold is attacked. Almost all those travelling with it, including Ciungu, are killed. One man is left alive to tell Tiberius that all such \"traitors\" will be killed. Tiberius is furious. He arranges a meeting with Gerula and tells him that if the Romans and the Dacians continue to attack each other, they will only weaken the country, making it ripe for invasion by the barbarians to the north. Gerula ponders this possibility. While doing so, he comes across Tiberius' young son, who has wandered away from the town to explore. Talking to him, he realises that the combination of Roman and Dacian culture can be positive. \n\nJust as Tiberius predicted, the chief of the northern barbarians plans to use the disorder in Dacia to expand into its territory. He meets with Gerula and suggests they join together to expel the Romans. Gerula decides that such an alliance would only replace invaders who brought civilization, with invaders who will bring barbarism. He convinces Decebalus's grandson to aid the Romans. The barbarian chief launches his attack on the Roman town. Tiberius has prepared sophisticated defences, but the force of the barbarian attack threatens to overwhelm the Romans until the free Dacians come to their aid in a cavalry attack. Tiberius sends in the Roman cavalry to support them and the barbarians are crushed. However, Decebalus's grandson is killed in the battle. Devastated, Gerula realises his dream of a restored Dacian kingdom is over. As Tiberius approaches the body of Decebalus' grandson, Gerula imagines he intends to decapitate him, as he did his grandfather. Confused and distraught, Gerula attacks and kills Tiberius. \n\nTiberius' body is brought back to the town accompanied by a chastened Gerula. As Andrada laments, Gerula tells the dead man's son that his father was a great warrior who fought for his people, and that he must grow up to defend the new country his father helped create.\n\n\nThe film's world premiere held on October 24, 1968, the International Film Festival in San Francisco. The premiere of the German version was held on 1 November 1968 at Vienna, while Romanian version premiere took place in November 18, 1968, in Bucharest.\n\n\"The Column\" was seen by 10,508,376 viewers in cinemas in Romania, as confirmed by a record of the number of spectators from the film's Romanian premiere date until 31.12.2007 compiled by the National Center of Cinematography. This places it in 7th place among the most viewed Romanian films of all time.\n\n\"The Column\" was Romania's submission for the best foreign film Oscar in 1969, but it was not one of the nominated in the competition. The film was given a Diploma of Merit International Film Festival in Adelaide, Australia.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1019924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1019924", "title": "The Hay Wain", "text": "The Hay Wain\n\nThe Hay Wain is a painting by John Constable, finished in 1821, which depicts a rural scene on the River Stour between the English counties of Suffolk and Essex. It hangs in the National Gallery in London and is regarded as \"Constable's most famous image\" and one of the greatest and most popular English paintings.\n\nPainted in oils on canvas, the work depicts as its central feature three horses pulling what in fact appears to be a wood wain or large farm cart across the river. Willy Lott's Cottage, also the subject of an eponymous painting by Constable, is visible on the far left. The scene takes place near Flatford Mill in Suffolk, though since the Stour forms the border of two counties, the left bank is in Suffolk and the landscape on the right bank is in Essex.\n\n\"The Hay Wain\" is one of a series of paintings by Constable called the \"six-footers\", large-scale canvasses which he painted for the annual summer exhibitions at the Royal Academy. As with all of the paintings in this series Constable produced a full-scale oil sketch for the work; this is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Constable originally exhibited the finished work with the title \"Landscape: Noon\", suggesting that he envisaged it as belonging to the classical landscape tradition of representing the cycles of nature.\n\nFlatford Mill was owned by Constable's father. The house on the left side of the painting belonged to a neighbor, Willy Lott, a tenant farmer, who was said to have been born in the house and never to have left it for more than four days in his lifetime. Willy Lott's Cottage has survived to this day practically unaltered, but none of the trees in the painting exist today.\n\nAlthough \"The Hay Wain\" is revered today as one of the greatest British paintings, when it was originally exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1821 (under the title \"Landscape: Noon\"), it failed to find a buyer. \nIt was considerably better received in France where it was praised by Théodore Géricault. The painting caused a sensation when it was exhibited with other works by Constable at the 1824 Paris Salon (it has been suggested that the inclusion of Constable's paintings in the exhibition was a tribute to Géricault, who died early that year). In that exhibition, \"The Hay Wain\" was singled out for a gold medal awarded by Charles X of France, a cast of which is incorporated into the picture's frame. The works by Constable in the exhibition inspired a new generation of French painters, including Eugène Delacroix.\n\nSold at the exhibition with three other Constables to the dealer John Arrowsmith, \"The Hay Wain\" was brought back to England by another dealer, D. T. White; he sold it to a Mr. Young who resided in Ryde on the Isle of Wight. It was there that the painting came to the attention of the collector Henry Vaughan and the painter Charles Robert Leslie. On the death of his friend Mr. Young, Vaughan bought the painting from the former's estate; in 1886 he presented it to the National Gallery in London, where it still hangs today. In his will Vaughan bequeathed the full-scale oil sketch for \"The Hay Wain\", made with a palette knife, to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum).\n\n\"The Hay Wain\" was voted the second most popular painting in any British gallery, second only to Turner's \"Fighting Temeraire\", in a 2005 poll organised by BBC Radio 4's \"Today\" programme. On 28 June 2013 a protester, reported to be connected with Fathers 4 Justice, glued a photograph of a young boy to the painting while it was on display at the National Gallery. The work was not permanently damaged.\n\nIt has been suggested that the reason for the wagon stopping at the ford was to allow the river water to cool the horses' legs and to soak the wheels. In hot dry weather, the wooden wheels would shrink away from their metal rims. Wetting the wheels reduced the shrinkage and kept the outer metal band in place.\n\n"}
{"id": "1801710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801710", "title": "The Magdalene Sisters", "text": "The Magdalene Sisters\n\nThe Magdalene Sisters is a 2002 Irish-British drama film written and directed by Peter Mullan, about three teenage girls who were sent to Magdalene Asylums (also known as 'Magdalene Laundries') homes for women who were labelled as \"fallen\" by their families or society. The homes were maintained by individual religious orders in the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland.\n\nPeter Mullan has remarked that the film was initially made because victims of Magdalene Asylums had received no closure in the form of recognition, compensation or apology, and many remained lifelong devout Catholics. Former Magdalene inmate Mary-Jo McDonagh told Mullan that the reality of the Magdalene Asylums was much worse than depicted in the film.\n\nThough set in Ireland, it was shot entirely on location in Dumfries and Galloway, South-West Scotland.\n\nSet in Ireland, beginning in 1964, so-called \"fallen\" women were considered sinners who needed to be redeemed. The film follows the stories of four young women - Margaret (raped by her cousin), Bernadette (too beautiful and coquettish), Rose (an unmarried mother) and Crispina (an intellectually disabled unmarried mother) - who are all forced by their families or caretakers into the Magdalene Asylum.\nThe film details the disastrous lives of the four girls whilst they are inmates, portraying their harsh daily regimen and their squalid living conditions put on at the laundries.\n\nEach woman suffers unspeakable cruelty and violence from the Mother Superior, Sister Bridget, despite her gentle-faced appearance and outwardly soft-spoken demeanour. She is characterised as sadistic and almost inhuman at times, as conveyed through her merciless beating of Rose in full view of Bernadette, or when she mockingly laughs at Una as she hopelessly clutches at her fallen hair locks.\n\nThe film also criticises the hypocrisy and corruption within the staff of the laundries. Sister Bridget relishes the money the business receives and it is suggested that little of it is distributed appropriately. Those who liken themselves to Mary Magdalene, who deprived herself of all pleasures of the flesh including food and drink, eat hearty breakfasts of buttered toast and bacon while the working women subsist on oatmeal. In one particularly humiliating scene, the women are forced to stand naked in a line after taking a communal shower. The nuns then hold a \"contest\" on who has the most pubic hair, biggest bottom, biggest breasts and smallest breasts. The corruption of the resident priest, Father Fitzroy, is made very clear through his sexual abuse of Crispina. However, as the years pass, automatic washing machines start to appear, a modern household appliance whose growing ubiquity would eventually fatally undermine the economic viability of commercial laundries and make the Magdalene Asylums unsustainable.\n\nThree of the girls are shown, to some extent, to triumph over their situation and their captors. Margaret, although she is allowed to leave by the intervention of her younger brother, does not leave the asylum without leaving her mark. When she deliberately asks Sister Bridget to step aside for her to freely pass and is sharply shot down, Margaret falls to her knees in prayer. The Mother Superior is so surprised, she only moves past her after the Bishop tells her to come along. Bernadette and Rose finally decide to escape together, trashing Sister Bridget's study in search for the key to the asylum door and engaging her in a suspenseful confrontation. The two girls escape her clutches and are helped to return to the real world by a sympathetic relative, their story optimistically ending when Rose boards a coach bound for the ferry to Liverpool and Bernadette becomes an apprentice hairdresser. Crispina's end, however, is not a happy one; she spends the rest of her days in a mental institution (where she was sent to silence her from revealing the sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of Father Fitzroy) and dies of anorexia at age 24. Her real name was also revealed to be Harriet.\n\nThe epilogue to the film gives a brief description of the lives of four of the inmates after the girls leave the asylum by the late 1960s. It is noted that the last Magdalene asylum closed in 1996.\n\n\nThe film received critical acclaim. As of 25 October 2008, the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 90% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 144 reviews. Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 83 out of 100, based on 38 reviews — indicating \"universal acclaim\". This made it the twentieth best reviewed film of the year. The film appeared on several US critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2003.\n\n\nThe film also received critical acclaim when it was premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2002. There Mullan was awarded the festival's highest prize, the Golden Lion.\n\n\n"}

Traditionally, the weaving is done by men of the Shoowa from the Kuba ethnic group, while the embroidery is reserved to women. Ideally, the embroiderers should be pregnant. The technique is still practised.\n\nOriginally the cloth was made using beaten wood bark but, since the introduction of raffia, only vestiges of this remain. Some belts (duun) are still made in bark; they symbolize power and may be worn only by certain nobles. Bark is still used for certain loincloths for women (Ishyeen). The center of these loincloths is formed of many triangles of bark, alternately black and white. These are cut out of the raw bark either natural, or dyed black and sewn together. The choice of this method rather than that of drawing is significant - for the Kuba, value is measured by a work's difficulty.\n\nThe fabric is made of very fine fibre from the inside of the leaves of young palm trees. The leaves are dried in the sun, then split along their length and connected to form a basic warp of raffia, from 2m to 4m in length. Fine leaf fibres are then interweaved in a woof to create the \"velvet\" effect. This is then wrapped around the waist to create a loincloth known as \"Mapel\" (for men) or \"Ntshak\" (for women).\n\nThe designs are very varied and are created spontaneously but normally follow the body scarification patterns of the Kuba.\n\nThe cloth is heavy and expensive and is not normally intended to be worn, but is used as a bed covering or on the royal throne. Individual items take from several months to a year to produce. Cloths were used as currency or given as gifts.\n\n"}

Few aspects of daily life are represented; the murals are predominantly abstract depictions of mythical deities that probably reflect a communal belief system. Teotihuacán is also unique in the fact that, even though it is contemporaneous with initial Mayan centers, there are relatively few hieroglyphic inscriptions. Esther Pasztory, of the Teotihuacán Murals Project, has postulated that they wanted to create an art style distinctly different the preceding Olmec culture and the contemporaneous Mayan centers. They were not interested in displaying a succession of kingship as commonly shown in other cultures of the area.\n\nEarly murals at the site are generally found located in small temples along the Avenue of the Dead and depict animals such as quetzals and felines as well as various plant varieties. During the Xolalpan stage of Teotihuacán (~AD 400), however, murals could be found in a wider variety of structures including many porticoes of apartment compounds. Additionally, themes of mythical supernatural deities and the increase in hieroglyphic notations led Pasztory to conclude that this change may mark a sort of decentralization within the society.\n\nThe Wagner Murals may help to show this process of decentralization. One of the best examples of this transition comes from the \"Feathered Serpents and Flowering Trees\" mural. While there are depictions of serpents and floral aspects common in early Teotihuacán artwork, within the flowering trees there are relatively rare depictions of simple glyphs. In all, there are four feathered serpents (two from the Wagner Collection) that accompany nine plants each. It has been suggested from some scholars that these nine plants with nine different glyphs may represent the nine lords of the underworld. It also may be one of the first references of the migration myth of the eight tribes of the Aztecs leaving the cave of origin.\n\nAnother predominant theme represented in a number of the Wagner Murals is the image of a figure wearing a three-tassel headdress. Thought to be connected with independent collections called the St. Louis and San Francisco Collections respectively, these figures are presumed to be originally found in Techinantila compound of Teotihuacán. Additional figures of similar form and colorations are found in the Houston and Milwaukee Collections. All of the figures are facing to the right and disks are placed at regular intervals above the depictions. If the proportions of this room were equivalent to those found in Teopancaxco (9mx3.4m), then this mural would have contained 20 figures surrounding the room, possibly led by the Storm God. Additionally, various glyphs under many of these tasseled headdresses may denote the individual names with which they are associated. As there are no discernible borders at the corners where the mural would be adjoined, these figures are thought to have been read continuously as one viewed them from wall to wall. A border of footprints along the top of the mural pieces helps to strengthen this notion.\n\nWhile the figures in this particular group seem to represent specific people or deities in Teotihuacán, the three-tassel headdress also seems to become a symbol for the people themselves. In distant areas like Tikal, for example, this three-tassel motif also shows up. On Stela 31 there is a depiction of what may be a military figure with a shield that is adorned with this very symbol. On a further note, the Storm God is always shown with the tassel headdress. Additionally, there are connections of the headdress to Great Goddess as seen in the Tetitla compound. This helps to show how these murals, while out of context, can help growing scholarship on interpretation. These murals could aide in Pasztory's notion of the transition in Teotihuacán culture. In the time of the Wagner Murals, iconography was used denote communal ideology and individual identification as well.\n\nAlmost all of the fragments were traced back in 1983 and 1984 by Rene Millon to the Techinantitla compound, some 500 yards east of the Avenue of the Dead and Pyramid of the Moon. The remainder of the fragments were traced by Millon to the Tlacuilapaxco compound.\n\nHarald Wagner was born in Falls City, Oregon in 1903. He later went on to obtain a degree in Architecture from the University of Oregon at Eugene. In 1927, Wagner moved to San Francisco and went to work as a draftsman for the architectural firm of Bliss & Faville. It was here that Wagner became adamantly interested in art. Influenced by his mentor, William Faville, and Arthur and Lucia Mathews, popular decor artists in the area, Wagner began to learn and collect art from around the world. In the 1950s, he traveled for the first time to Mexico where he fell in love with the country and its people. He eventually purchased a house there where he lived part-time. It was here that, in the mid-1960s, he began to acquire a collection of mural pieces from the city of Teotihuacán. His combined love of architecture and its various artistic components fueled his collective spirit and his collection quickly grew to over seventy pieces. Although it seems that his original intention of this collection was to sell it for profit, increased awareness of the ethical implications of acquiring such collections nullified their marketability. In the end, Wagner donated the entire collection to the de Young Museum in San Francisco as part of his will shortly following his death in 1976.\n\nSince that time, the collection has been extensively studied by numerous academics of Teotihuacán culture. Because of excessive looting at the site of Teotihuacán, scholarship has been very difficult to undertake. Very few murals were known \"in situ\" before the emergence of the Wagner Murals. However, they may eventually help us to fully understand the artistic depictions created by the people of Teotihuacán.\n\n"}
{"id": "330273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=330273", "title": "World Fantasy Award", "text": "World Fantasy Award\n\nThe World Fantasy Awards are a set of awards given each year for the best fantasy fiction published during the previous calendar year. Organized and overseen by the World Fantasy Convention, the awards are given each year at the eponymous annual convention as the central focus of the event. They were first given in 1975, at the first World Fantasy Convention, and have been awarded annually since. Over the years that the award has been given, the categories presented have changed; currently World Fantasy Awards are given in five written categories, one category for artists, and four special categories for individuals to honor their general work in the field of fantasy.\n\nThe awards have been described by book critics such as \"The Guardian\" as a \"prestigious fantasy prize\", and one of the three most prestigious speculative fiction awards, along with the Hugo and Nebula Awards (which cover both fantasy and science fiction). World Fantasy Award nominees and winners are decided by attendees of the convention and a panel of judges, typically made up of fantasy authors. Winners receive a small trophy; through the 2015 awards it was a bust of H. P. Lovecraft designed by cartoonist Gahan Wilson. The bust was retired following that year amid complaints about Lovecraft's history of racism; a new statuette designed by Vincent Villafranca depicting a tree in front of a full moon was released in 2017. The 2018 awards were presented at the 44th World Fantasy Convention in Baltimore, Maryland, on November 4, 2018, and the 2019 awards will be presented at the 45th World Fantasy Convention in Los Angeles, California, on November 3, 2019.\n\nThe World Fantasy Awards were established at the first World Fantasy Convention, an annual convention of professionals, collectors, and others interested in the field of fantasy, held that first year in horror writer H. P. Lovecraft's home city of Providence, Rhode Island in 1975. Winners were presented with a trophy in the form of a bust of an elongated caricature of Lovecraft designed by cartoonist Gahan Wilson, nicknamed the \"Howard\", which matched the theme of the first convention, \"The Lovecraft Circle\". As stated by Wilson in \"First World Fantasy Awards: An Anthology of the Fantastic\", \"The point of the awards was, is, and hopefully shall be to give a visible, potentially usable, sign of appreciation to writers working in the area of fantastic literature, an area too often distinguished by low financial remuneration and indifference\".\n\nAt the start of the awards in 1975, seven categories were presented: Best Novel, Best Short Fiction, Best Collection, Best Artist, Special Award—Professional, Special Award—Non-professional, and Life Achievement. Only a few categories have changed since then, and no changes have been made to the rules. 1978 saw the addition of the Convention Award, a special award given for general contributions to the genre, and the only award not given every year since the beginning. The Short Fiction award was split into Short Story and Novella awards in 1982, and in 1988 the multi-author anthologies, previously eligible for the Collection award, were split into their own Best Anthology category. No changes have been made since.\n\nWinners were presented with the H. P. Lovecraft bust through the 2015 awards; at that ceremony the presenters announced that future ceremonies will no longer use the trophy. Although controversy had arisen in recent years over Lovecraft's history of racism, no explicit reason was given for the change. A new statuette, designed by Vincent Villafranca, was announced in April 2017 to be used for the 2016 awards on. The new award, which depicts a tree in front of a full moon, was intended to evoke the use of trees and night imagery in mythology, fantasy, and horror works.\n\nWorld Fantasy Award nominees and winners are decided by judges and attendees of the World Fantasy Convention. A ballot is posted in June for attendees of the current and previous two conferences to determine two of the finalists, with the two most-nominated selected, and a panel of five judges adds three or more nominees before voting on the overall winner. The panel of judges is typically made up of fantasy authors, as well as other fantasy professionals and is chosen each year by the World Fantasy Awards Administration, which has the power to break ties if the judges are deadlocked. The awards administration is a subgroup of the World Fantasy Convention Board, which selects sites for upcoming World Fantasy Conventions. Both the board and the judges panel are largely made up of professionals in the field of fantasy. The judges for the 2014 awards, for example, were authors Andy Duncan, Kij Johnson, Oliver Johnson, and Liz Williams, and editor John Klima.\n\nThe nominees are announced in July, and final results are presented at the World Fantasy Convention around the end of October. The Life Achievement and Convention Awards do not list nominees, and instead have the winner announced along with the other categories' nominees. The Life Achievement winner is decided by the judges panel, while the Convention award winner, not given every year, is selected by the convention organizers. The World Fantasy Convention itself is a multi-day event with several hundred attendees taking place in a different city each year, usually in the United States but sometimes in Canada or the United Kingdom. In addition to the awards ceremony, the conventions include an art show, a dealer's room, autograph receptions, and numerous panels and discussions.\n\nThe World Fantasy Awards are split into ten categories, including both awards for written works and for professionals in the field. Eligibility requirements are loosely defined: works must have been published in the prior calendar year, and professionals must still be living. All types of fantasy works are accepted, regardless of subgenre or style, though whether a given work is considered to be fantasy is left up to the discretion of the nominators and judges.\n\nAcross all categories, Ellen Datlow has both the most nominations and most wins of any nominee, with 10 wins out of 42 nominations, primarily for her anthologies. She is followed by Terri Windling with 9 out of 30 and Stephen Jones with 3 out of 28, both also mainly for editing anthologies. Jeffrey Ford has the highest number of wins after Datlow and Windling with 6 out of 14 nominations, and is tied for the highest number of fiction awards with Stephen King at four.\n\nThe awards have been described by book critics such as \"The Guardian\" as a \"prestigious fantasy prize\", and one of the three most prestigious speculative fiction awards, along with the Hugo and Nebula Awards (which cover both fantasy and science fiction). In 2010 multiple winner George R. R. Martin described winning the Hugo, Nebula, and \"the prestigious World Fantasy Award\" as the \"triple crown\". Others have also noted the award's prestige in the field, such as Tachyon Publications and 2014 Best Anthology winner Gardner Dozois. Stephen Jones of the \"Best New Horror\" series has said that winning the anthology award for their first volume in 1991 helped \"establish the series among readers and some publishers\" in multiple countries. Winners such as Nnedi Okorafor—Best Novel in 2011—have described the award as \"one of my greatest honors as a writer\". Editor and bookseller Rick Klaw in 2007, however, noted that the consensus at the time \"in the bookselling community\" was that winning the novel category did not have any effect on sales and did not help keep the book in print, with 57 percent of prior winners out of print, compared to 23 percent of Hugo Award winners from the same time period.\n\nTwo anthologies have been drawn from the World Fantasy Award winners: \"First World Fantasy Awards: An Anthology of the Fantastic\" in 1977, edited by Gahan Wilson and covering stories from the initial award year, and \"The World Fantasy Awards: Volume Two\" in 1980, edited by Stuart David Schiff and Fritz Leiber.\n\nAt the 1991 awards, graphic novel \"The Sandman\" issue #19 \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", scripted by Neil Gaiman and illustrated by Charles Vess, won the award for Best Short Story. A common rumor afterwards was that the rules were subsequently changed to prevent another graphic novel from winning. The awards administration later clarified that comics and graphic novels were not intended to be eligible for that category, which did not require a rule change: \"Comics are eligible in the Special Award Professional category. We never made a change in the rules.\" No person has won or been nominated for the Special Award Professional category for their work on a comic or graphic novel either before or since the controversy.\n\nA minor controversy about the trophy occurred in 1984, when Donald Wandrei refused his Life Achievement award as he felt the award bust was a demeaning caricature of Lovecraft, whom he had known personally. Wandrei's rejected trophy was later recycled and given to another award winner.\n\nA larger controversy surrounding the bust began in the 2010s, when several authors began to object to using the author H. P. Lovecraft as the symbol of the awards, given his outspoken racism, though others such as Lovecraft biographer S. T. Joshi claimed that Lovecraft's attitudes were not considered extreme at the time. Winners Okorafor and China Miéville noted in 2011 that they disliked being honored by a bust of a man who would have found many of the winners and nominees distasteful because of their race. Several authors and editors argued for the trophy to be changed, including a petition by author Daniel José Older in 2014, an editorial by \"The New York Review of Science Fiction\" editor Kevin J. Maroney arguing that it should be changed \"as a courtesy to generations of writers whom the WFA hopes to honor\", and 2014 Best Novel winner Sofia Samatar's acceptance speech.\n\nIn September 2014, the administrators of the World Fantasy Award announced they were \"in discussion\" about the future of the award trophy. In November 2015, at the 2015 awards, they announced that the Lovecraft bust would no longer be used beginning the following year. Lenika Cruz, associate editor of \"The Atlantic\", defended the decision, stating that \"Lovecraft's removal is about more than just the writer himself; it's not an indictment of his entire oeuvre\". Lovecraft scholar S. T. Joshi, however, expressed anger at the decision, and returned his two World Fantasy Awards and urged a boycott of the convention.\n\n"}
