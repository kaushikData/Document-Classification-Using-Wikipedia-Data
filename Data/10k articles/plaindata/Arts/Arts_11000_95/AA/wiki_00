This is down from 87,500 employees and number 156 on the 2016 list. Fortune named AECOM as one of 2015 World's Most Admired Companies, and again in 2016 & 2017. Engineering News-Record ranked AECOM as Number 1 Global Design Firm.\n\nThe company's official name from 1990 to early January 2015 was AECOM Technology Corporation. Today, it is known simply as AECOM. The company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol ACM and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol E6Z.\n\nOperating through more than a dozen subsidiaries, AECOM traces its origins to Kentucky-based Ashland Oil & Refining Company, which in turn grew out of Swiss Drilling Company, founded in Oklahoma in 1910 by J. Fred Miles. He gained control of some 200,000 acres and formed Swiss Oil Company in Lexington. In 1924 Miles launched a refining operation called Ashland Refining Company, headed by Paul Blazer. While the parent company struggled, leading to the ouster of Miles, Ashland prospered under Blazer's leadership, and in 1936 he was named chief executive officer of the reorganized company, Ashland Oil & Refining Company. In 1966 Ashland acquired Warren Brothers and became involved in highway construction and construction materials. The company was able to take advantage of refinery byproducts to produce asphalt. Ashland grew into one of the nation's major road-construction firms, and laid a foundation for AECOM. Through a series of acquisitions and technological developments prior to the buyout, Ashland grew to include chemical, petrochemical, highway construction, and construction materials firms within its realm, laying the groundwork for the management buyout of Ashland Technology in 1985.\n\nIn the 1970s Ashland Oil & Refining became Ashland Oil, Inc. Five years later the company consolidated its construction assets into a construction division and also formed a coal subsidiary, indicative of a changing focus at Ashland. Although it generated more than $1 billion a year in sales, Ashland was a small player in the oil industry at a time when the cost of exploration was prohibitively expensive. By 1980 Ashland sold its production assets, and a year later was reorganized as a modified holding company. A new corporate strategy was implemented as Ashland now focused on refining and marketing, and sought to grow its non-refining businesses. In 1984 Ashland acquired Daniel, Mann, Johnson & Mendenhall (DMJM), a global provider of transportation-related engineering services. Originally focused on military projects, after World War II it had become one of the first integrated engineering and architectural firms in the western United States. The acquisition of DMJM also included its president, Richard G. Newman, AECOM's future chief executive and chairman. In 1985 DMJM became part of a new subsidiary, Ashland Technology Corporation. Two years later Newman was named its new president.\n\nWhen Ashland chose to return to its core petroleum refining business in the late 1980s, Newman recommended an employee buyback proposal, resulting in the spin-off of Ashland Technology and the creation of AECOM (Architecture, Engineering, Consulting, Operations, and Maintenance) in 1990. The company went on to acquire a number of engineering, design and planning firms including engineering company Maunsell, urbanism and sustainability practice EDAW, Economic Research Associates (ERA), environmental management firm ENSR and The RETEC Group Inc., architects Ellerbe Becket and Davis Langdon, the quantity surveyors and construction consultants.\n\nAECOM acquired Metcalf and Eddy, a water and wastewater engineering firm based in Massachusetts, in 2000.\n\nAECOM went public during May 2007 with an initial public offering on the NYSE, netting $468.3 million. On January 8, 2008 AECOM acquired The Services Group, Inc., a provider of consulting services to the US Agency for International Development and other multi-lateral donor organizations. On July 28, 2008, AECOM completed its purchase of Earth Tech Inc., a consulting and engineering firm, from Tyco International for $510 million. On July 14, 2010, AECOM announced its acquisition of Tishman Construction Corp., a leading provider of construction management services in the United States and the United Arab Emirates, in a $245 million transaction including $202 million in cash and the remainder in AECOM common stock. On July 13, 2014, AECOM announced its acquisition of URS Corporation, an engineering, construction, and technical services firm for US$56.31 per share in cash and stock. Effective July 10, 2014, it acquired ACE International Consultants SL, a Madrid-based provider of consulting services. In July 2014, it acquired Hunt Construction Group, adding to AECOM's construction services business.\n\nIn 2012, the company had assets worth $5.67 billion, and equity of $2.23 billion. In 2015, Aecom had operating income of $535.19 million and net income of $154.85 million. In 2016, Aecom had revenue of $17.4 billion. In 2017, Aecom reported full year revenue of $18.2 billion, a new high for the company. Net income for the year came to $339 million. Operating income for the full year came to $241 million.\n\nAECOM's first president and CEO was Richard Newman, who came to Ashland through its acquisition of DMJM. Newman served as president of Ashland Technology and was instrumental in the creation of AECOM.\n\nIn 2005, John M. Dionisio succeeded Newman as president and CEO of AECOM. In 2011, Dionisio became chairman of the company. In March 2014, Michael S. Burke succeeded Dionisio and serves as the company's current chairman and CEO. Dionisio remains on AECOM's Board of Directors.\n\nIn 2011, Stephen M. Kadenacy was named chief financial officer and currently serves as president. In 2017 Kadenacy was succeeded by Randy Wotring.\n\nIn May 2014, Kevin Lynch was appointed as executive vice president and chief strategy officer at AECOM.\n\nIn March 2015, Carla Christofferson was appointed as executive vice president and general counsel of the firm.\n\nIn August 2015, Mary E. Finch was named executive vice president and chief human resources officer, effective September 28.\n\nAECOM provides professional technical and management support services to both public and private sector clients. AECOM currently works in the following areas: the Americas, Europe, Asia, Middle East, Africa, and Australia/New Zealand. Services relate to areas including Archaeology, Architecture & Design, Asset Management, Construction, Cost Management, Decommissioning & Closure, Economics, Engineering, Environmental Services, International Development, IT & Cyber Security, Operations & Maintenance, Planning & Consulting, Program, Management/Construction Management, Risk Management & Resilience and Technical Services.\n\nAECOM is headquartered in Los Angeles, California, United States, with clients in more than 150 countries. The company reported a revenue of US$17.4 billion during the 12 months that ended September 30, 2016.\n\nAECOM and its projects have received various awards, including:\n\n\n\n"}

While architecture was present in many of the earliest paintings and illuminations, it was mainly used as background or to provide rhythm to a painting. In the Renaissance, architecture was used to emphasize the perspective and create a sense of depth, like in Masaccio's \"Holy Trinity\" from the 1420s.\n\nIn Western art, architectural painting as an independent genre developed in the 16th century in Flanders and the Netherlands, and reached its peak in 16th and 17th century Dutch painting. Later, it developed in a tool for Romantic paintings, with e.g. views of ruins becoming very popular. Closely related genres are architectural fantasies and trompe-l'oeils, especially illusionistic ceiling painting, and cityscapes.\n\nThe 16th century saw the development of architectural painting as a separate genre in Western art. The main centers in this period were Flanders and the Netherlands. The first important architectural painter was Dutch Hans Vredeman de Vries (1527-1607), who was both an architect and a painter. Students of Hans Vredeman de Vries, both in Flanders and in the Netherlands, include his sons Salomon and Paul, and Hendrik van Steenwijk I. Through them the genre was popularized and their family and students turned it into one of the main domains of Dutch Golden Age painting.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 17th century, architectural painting became one of the leading genres in the Dutch Golden Age, together with portrait painting and landscapes. Notable Dutch painter of the genre include:\n\n\nArchitectural paintings, and the related vedute or cityscapes, were especially popular in 18th century Italy. Another genre closely related to architectural painting proper were the capriccios, fantasies set in and focusing on an imaginary architecture. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn China, architectural painting was called \"jiehua\", and mainly seen as an inferior type of painting. Known masters of the genre include the 10th century painter Guo Zhongshu, and Wang Zhenpeng, who was active around 1300.\n"}

Makepeace & Company, established in 1889, was a nationally active firm of mill architects based in Providence, Rhode Island. It was dissolved in 1944.\n\nFounder Charles R. Makepeace was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina on May 20, 1860. He attended Duke University, then known as Trinity College, but left without graduating in 1880. He then worked on a number of cotton mills in Randolph County, before eventually making his way to Rhode Island. He first practiced as a member of D. M. Thompson & Company in Providence. When David M. Thompson left the partnership to manage mills for B. B. & R. Knight, Makepeace formed a new partnership, Hall & Makepeace, with established architect Clifton A. Hall. This lasted from 1884 to 1886. Hall was prominent as both a designer of industrial buildings as well as those that normally made up an architect's practice. \n\nIn 1886 Makepeace left, and opened his own office. He established C. R. Makepeace & Company in 1889. Circa 1892 he made his designer, Charles A. M. Praray, a partner. He added new associates when Praray left in 1898. Makepeace's son, the MIT-trained C. Salisbury Makepeace, joined the office in 1916, upon graduating. \nAfter Makepeace's death in 1926, the company was presumably managed by C. Salisbury Makepeace. Henry A. McClean purchased the firm in 1928, and managed it until 1944, when it was dissolved. McClean died in West Warwick in 1950. C. Salisbury Makepeace died in August 1949.\nCharles Praray first emerges as the chief designer and construction engineer of the Makepeace firm, and was made a partner circa 1892. As designer, in 1894, he patented what was known as \"Praray's Improved Construction\", a system of mill construction which separated the structure of the roof and floors of a mill from that of the walls, allowing much more daylight to enter the building. Visually, Praray's design may be most noted for its unusual window patterns, which emerge from the brick piers in a zig-zag pattern. Only five these mills have been documented as being built, but Chas. A. M. Praray & Company touted it in advertisements for many years. Prior to its demolition around 2014, the Selma Cotton Mill of 1896 in Alabama was the best-preserved example of Praray's mill design. The only surviving example with walls intact is one of the Holt mills in Haw River, North Carolina.\n\nPraray has also been identified as the designer of Makepeace & Co.'s Petersburg Silk Mills in Scranton, Pennsylvania, designed in 1897. He prepared \"several sets\" of designs, one of which was likely to be a Praray's Improved Construction design. However, this was rejected in favor of a conventional design.\n\nIn 1898 Praray left to establish his own office, Chas. A. M. Praray & Company, with William Whittam, Jr. The firm had two offices, one at Providence, and one at Charlotte, North Carolina, managed by Whittam. The partnership existed until about 1909. Praray then took his son, Charles W. Praray, into partnership, as C. A. M. Praray & Son. He died in 1910.\n"}
{"id": "633236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=633236", "title": "Chicago school (literary criticism)", "text": "Chicago school (literary criticism)\n\nThe Chicago School of literary criticism was a form of criticism of English literature begun at the University of Chicago in the 1930s, which lasted until the 1950s. It was also called Neo-Aristotelianism, due to its strong emphasis on Aristotle’s concepts of plot, character and genre. It was partly a reaction to New Criticism, a then highly popular form of literary criticism, which the Chicago critics accused of being too subjective and placing too much importance on irony and figurative language. They aimed instead for total objectivity and a strong classical basis of evidence for criticism. The New Critics regarded the language and poetic diction as most important, but the Chicago School considered such things merely the building material of poetry. Like Aristotle, they valued the structure or form of a literary work as a whole, rather than the complexities of the language. Despite this, the Chicago School is considered by some to be a part of the New Criticism movement.\n\nRonald Salmon Crane (1886–1967) is considered the founder of the Chicago Aristotelians. He began teaching at the University of Chicago in 1924, was made a professor in 1925, and chaired the English department there from 1935–1947. In 1935, he wrote “History versus Criticism in the Study of Literature” (published in \"English Journal\" 24 [1935]:645-67), in which he defined literary criticism as “simply the disciplined consideration, at once analytical and evaluative, of literary works as works of art.” Crane was greatly influenced by Richard McKeon, a professor of philosophy at the University, who stressed Aristotle’s idea of \"pluralism,\" which says that many systems of criticism are necessary to completely understand literature, specifically poetry, or in the case of philosophy, the world. Crane said that “the only rational ground for adhering to one [form of criticism] rather than to any of the others is its superior capacity to give us the special kind of understanding and evaluation of literature we want to get, at least for the time being.”\n\nThe question for the Chicago School (as it was for Aristotle) was always what the purpose of the theory of criticism was, what hypotheses were brought to bear by the theory about the nature of literature (for instance, whether it consisted of the words alone, or whether it was to be thought of as part of a larger context such as an era or an artist's life), and the definitions of words (such as the definition of tragedy or comedy).\n\nThe Chicago School claimed not to preclude other theories of criticism. It did, however, criticize those who were not clear or consistent about the initial hypotheses and definitions behind their theories. It thus appeared to many of the proponents of those theories that the Chicago School was claiming that theirs was the only good and effective approach to literature. For this reason, they were considered by some critics (including W.K. Wimsatt, whose essay \"The Chicago Critics\" is a critical assessment of their work) to be hypocritical, although they would vehemently deny this.\n\nMany of the ideas of the Chicago School are thought to have come out of the reorganization of undergraduate education at the University of Chicago by Robert Maynard Hutchins, then President there. He placed great importance on primary sources and interdisciplinary studies for all students. Crane and his colleagues were forced to defend English as a valid topic of study, and the Chicago School might have developed partly from this pressure to put the study of English on a sound classical basis.\n\nOther key figures in the Chicago School were W.R. Keast, Norman Maclean, Elder Olson, and Bernard Weinberg. After this first generation, the most important critics to carry on the theory were Wayne C. Booth (who taught at the University of Chicago from 1947-1950 and again from 1962 until his death in 2005) and his contemporaries, Richard L. Levin, Sheldon Sacks, Robert Marsh, Arthur Heiserman, and Ralph W. Rader. Booth loosened the rigid categories of genre originally set forth by the Chicago School, and moved the concentration away from poetry towards rhetoric. The Chicago School has demonstrated continuing importance, and continuing flexibility, in the work of the third-generation Chicago critics, including Michael Boardman, Barbara Foley, Walter A. Davis, Dorothy Hale, Elizabeth Langland, James Phelan, Peter J. Rabinowitz, David H. Richter, and Harry Shaw, among others.\n\nGreat works in the Chicago School include \"Critics and Criticism\" (Crane, ed. Chicago, 1952), \"The Languages of Criticism and the Structure of Poetry\" (Crane, Toronto, 1953), and \"The Rhetoric of Fiction\" (Booth. Chicago, 1983).\n\n"}

Cultural districts may be seen by local authorities as a way to revitalize the “brownfields” of the urban core: areas of abandoned buildings that encourage businesses and residents to leave the cities.\n\nThe developing theory of cultural districts increasingly conceives them as development models for local systems, where the term ‘district’ refers to supra-urban area. At supra-urban or regional level the complexity of a cultural district is even more marked than at urban level, due to potential interdependencies among a greater multitude of actors. A useful approach towards a deeper understanding can be to conceive cultural districts as complex adaptive systems. Indeed, complexity is definitely not a management fad and fashion, a mere metaphor or methodology, but a deeper perception of reality. Organizations are classically seen as purpose-driven entities with a structural form, exhibiting a certain degree of order and determinism. Such a linear top-down approach to analysis and design, however, exhibits many limitations when used for organizational settings characterized by a complex web of interdependencies. The view of a cultural district as a complex adaptive system suggests new ideas and approaches for policy-makers, designers and managers. It also opens up debate on issues of organizational design and change.\n\nMore than 90 cities in the United States have planned or implemented cultural districts, positioning the arts at the center of their urban revitalization efforts.\nAll cultural districts are unique, reflecting their cities’ unique environment, including history of land use, urban growth and cultural development. There is no standard model.\nMost cultural districts are built to take advantage of other city attractions such as historic features, convention spaces and parks and other natural amenities.\n\nStructural considerations within or near the district, community leadership and social forces all influence the development of a cultural district and the type of district that results. Factors influencing the siting of cultural districts include: perceived need for urban revitalization, existing investment, property value and preexisting cultural facilities.\n\nUnlike a cultural center or a shopping mall, a cultural district comprises a large number of property owners, both public and private, who control the various properties involved, hence a structural complexity. The effectiveness of the coordinating agency in guiding the direction of the cultural district varies according to its size, budget, mandated functions and degree of authority, resulting in widespread variation in the coordinated cultural programming and administration services offered by cultural districts. The coordinated agency appointed for the district must work carefully to ensure inclusiveness of concerns and to balance potentially conflicting interests.\n\nCultural districts offer two major types of services: one targets the arts community, providing marketing /promotion, box office services and property management; the other targets the district’s business and property owners, offering urban design and development services or administrative support.\n\nThe excitement and attraction of a cultural district is a high mixture of interesting things to do, places to see, and places to visit (both cultural and noncultural), across the day and evening.\n\nSome artist-activists are promoting the concept of a \"Naturally Occurring Cultural District,\" or NOCD, patterned after the demographic concept of a naturally occurring retirement community. A NOCD \"supports existing neighborhood cultural assets rather than imposing arts institutions somewhere new,\" according to Tamara Greenfield, co-director of NOCD-New York. Co-director Caron Atlas explained: \"If a cultural district has emerged 'naturally,' then it grows from, builds on and validates existing community assets rather than importing assets from outside a community.\" Indeed, different conceptions of cultural districts include self-organization and emergence in different degrees (e.g. Lazzeretti, 2003; Le Blanc, 2010; Sacco et al., 2013; Stern & Seifert, 2007). Many authors argue that districtualization is essentially spontaneous and that the conditions for formation can be recognized and sustained, not created from the top. If the conception of a cultual district as a complex adaptive system were accepted, the design process would be conceived as something more flexible, dynamic and in evolution. Complexity theory and complex adaptive systems should move understanding of supra-urban cultural districts towards a more holistic and bottom-up approach rather than a linear top-down approach to analysis and design. This does not suggest inhibiting any attempt at prediction or planning. The use of qualitative analysis and rough estimations or agent-based modelling can represent a fertile ground for both future research, policy-making and managerial implications.\n\n"}

She was awarded an MBE in Her Majesty The Queen; Elizabeth II's 2016 Birthday Honors, a year later in 2017 she received the Ghana Peace Awards Humanitarian Service Laureate in Accra, Ghana.\n\nAs an actress she appeared on British TV shows including EastEnders and Holby City, before moving into presenting, hosting television programmes on British and Ghanaian TV including The Dentaa Show and reality TV music competition Mentor IV. She also had a brief career as a singer, releasing a gospel album in 2005, \"Wu Ye Nyame\".\n\nDentaa is an advocate for the Ghanaian community in the UK\nand in 2017 she was put on the list of 100 \"Most Outstanding Women Entrepreneurs in Ghana\" for her advocacy by \"The African Network of Entrepreneurs\" . In 2009 she founded the GUBA (Ghanaian UK Based Achievements) Awards, which recognises the achievements of individuals and organisations \"positively contributing to the Ghanaian community in the UK or Ghana\". In 2011, she was named in The Future 100 Awards as a \"Young Social Entrepreneur\" of the year for her work with GUBA.\n\nIn June 2013, Dentaa was announced as the winner of the annual African Women in Europe (AWE) Award, for her work in promoting Ghanaian achievement in the UK and for her charity work. Organisers described her as an \"icon and role model to all African women living and working in Europe\".\n\nDentaa is currently based in London, England.\n\nDentaa was born in Juaso, in the Ashanti Region of Ghana, but moved with her family to the UK at the age of five. From a young age she enjoyed performing in school plays and talent shows. She took her GCSEs at the Walthamstow School for Girls and A Levels (Media Studies, Sociology and Performing Arts) at the Leyton Sixth Form College. She went on to study for a degree in paediatric nursing at Buckinghamshire New University.\n\nBetween the late 1990s and early 2000s, Dentaa appeared on British TV dramas including EastEnders, Holby City, Judge John Deed, Run Baby Run, and Prime Suspect.\n\nIn 2005, she released a gospel album entitled \"Wu Ye Nyame\", through Alordia Promotions and Goodies Music Production. The album received airplay on radio stations in Ghana and Dentaa supported the release with a global tour.\n\nIn 2006, Dentaa produced and fronted a new TV show for British ethnic minority channel OBE (Original Black Entertainment) TV called \"The Dentaa Show\". The 30-minute syndicated magazine programme, broadcast on Sky Channel 155, was filmed in front of a live audience and split into three segments exploring the Ghanaian and African entertainment scene through interviews with celebrities, coverage of entertainment events and a focus on the latest music chart videos. The show was Ghana's most-watched entertainment programme. and in its first year, scored the highest ratings in first-run syndication in the 18 – 40 years demographic, out-performing established talk shows. The Dentaa Show ran for three seasons.\n\nDentaa co-hosted Miss Ghana UK in 2007 and the following year became a co-host on the fourth series of Mentor — Ghana's equivalent of The X-Factor — on Ghanaian TV channel TV3, alongside Kofi Okyere Darko (aka \"KOD\"). In 2009 she co-hosted the Ghana Music Awards, performing a duet with Batman Samini, and in 2010 presented Ghana's first make-over show, Darling Beauty Diaries. She did not, however, return for the fifth series of Mentor in 2010 as she was by then pregnant with her second child.\n\nIn August 2012, it was announced that Dentaa would be making a return to TV with new weekly show Dinner with Dentaa, which features celebrity guests cooking for her.\n\nOutside of broadcasting, Dentaa is known as the founder and CEO of non-profit organisation the Ghana UK Based Achievement (GUBA) Awards which organises an annual awards ceremony in Britain recognising the ‘hugely significant’ contribution that British-Ghanaians make to society. Dentaa founded the awards in 2009 with the first awards ceremony taking place in London, England, in October 2010. Dentaa, who describes herself as a \"proud Ghanaian\", had the idea to set up the awards as she felt that there was \"nothing out there promoted and enriched my heritage\".\n\nGUBA was the first ceremony of its kind to specifically recognise Ghanaian achievement and has since been endorsed by dignitaries and organisations including The Ghana High Commission to the UK & Ireland, The British High Commission in Ghana, The Ghana Ministry of Tourism, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and wife Cherie, Lord Paul Boateng, Diane Abbott MP and FIFA President Sepp Blatter.\n\nDentaa's achievements with GUBA were acknowledged in 2011 when she was announced as one of the \"Young Social Entrepreneurs of the Year\" in the annual Future 100 Awards, and again in 2013 when she received the African Women in Europe (AWE) Award. Dentaa has recently been nominated for two categories at the annual Women4Africa awards to be held in London in May 2014\n\nDentaa has a strong connection to the world of football. She is the Manager of Ghana and former Sunderland striker Asamoah Gyan, and played an \"influential role\" in helping Ghana's national football team, popularly known as the Black Stars, secure the services of Arsenal midfielder Emmanuel Frimpong.\n\nIn May 2012, she organised the launch of the Benjani Mwaruwari Foundation, set up by Portsmouth and Zimbabwe national football team striker Benjani Mwaruwari to build a football academy for underprivileged youths in Zimbabwe. The following month, in June 2012, Dentaa helped the Arthur Wharton Foundation present a statuette of Arthur Wharton — the first professional black football player — to FIFA President Sepp Blatter. The Arthur Wharton Marquette Statue is now displayed in the presidents' lounge at FIFA headquarters in Zurich.\n\nDentaa's work in the sporting arena was recognised in 2011, when she was nominated for the 2011 Black List Awards — a UK-based awards scheme that acknowledges the contribution of the black community for achievements across all levels of football, and which is supported by the Football Association, Professional Footballers' Association and Black Collective of Media in Sport (BCOMS), among others. Her management of Gyan and influence in the signing of Frimpong to the Ghana national team were \"key factors\" in her nomination.\n\n"}

True to its name, this type of bottle is distinguished by two spouts with a handle bridging them. First used by the Paracas culture, it was later adopted by the Nazca. While at first the Paracas tended to incise designs derived from the art of the Chavin culture on the surface of the vessels, later on they began to treat the vessel as a sculptural form, an advance facilitated by developments in ceramic technology that allowed them construct vessels with thinner walls. This tradition was continued by the Nazca, whose vessels were elaborately figurative (see illustration below right), decorated with polychrome glazes, or both. \nThe vessels were constructed by the coil method. The Nazca would then apply multicolored slip to achieve polychrome effects before the vessels were fired, an advance over the Paracas, who had painted the vessels with resins after firing. The Nazca technique allowed for much brighter and more permanent colors, whose sheen was enhanced by burnishing after the vessel was fired.\n\nBoth the Paracas and the Nazca appear to have used this type of vessel for ritual purposes, as they are most often found in graves.\n\n"}

He produced several books in addition to his newspaper and radio work and created mosaics for Ludwig Oppenheimer Ltd, mostly on a religious theme. His radio broadcasts made him well known to the British public in the 1930s.\n\nAfter gaining a BA from Manchester University in 1913, he worked as a designer at Ludwig Oppenheimer Ltd, the mosaic firm founded by his grandfather and based in Old Trafford, Manchester. His work, and that of the Oppenheimer firm is still to be seen in several churches in Britain and Ireland. He took part in the Paris exhibition in 1925.\n\nHe is best known as an art critic and writer. He was appointed art critic of the Manchester Guardian in 1930, although he had provided copy for that paper for some years prior to this. He was art critic for The Times for three years from 1947, and wrote frequently for the New York Times, \"Time and Tide\" magazine and ArtReview\n\nNewton delivered radio lectures on art, notably the 1935 BBC 12 part series \"The Artist and his Public\" subsequently turned into the first of several books. and took part in the radio arts series \"The Critics\". In this programme, his Times Obituary states \"his lucidity and critical sense were trenchantly displayed\". The Oxford Dictionary of Art describes him as \"a clear and polished writer and also an articulate lecturer and radio broadcaster\".\n\nThese broadcasts made his name well known and local newspaper archives reveal that Newton was clearly in demand, delivering public lectures across the country in the late 1930s and 1940s.\nNewton undertook lecture tours to North America in 1937, 1953 and 1956, the 1937 tour of Canada was sponsored by the National Gallery of Canada. His diary of this tour was subsequently published (see below). The 1956 tour included the Memorial University of Newfoundland where he lectured on modern art. A photograph exists in the university archives. Newton was lecturer in art history at the Central School of Art and crafts from 1963.\n\nHis MA, completed in 1951 at Manchester was on the subject of the renaissance artist Tintoretto, and was subsequently published in 1952 as a book.\n\nNewton was Slade Professor of Fine Art at Oxford in 1959 and art adviser to the Commonwealth Institute from 1960 to 1963. He was president of the British Section of the International Association of Art Critics between 1949 and 1961.\n\nWhile he left the family firm, he continued to create mosaics for much of his life, those in the side chapels of Sacred Heart Church Sheffield being installed in 1961. The Courtauld Institute of Art holds many designs of Newton Mosaics and theatre set designs in its Stella Newton Archive.\n\nNewton was born in 1893 to Lehmann James Oppenheimer and Edith née Newton. His mother was from Heaton Mersey. In 1908 he was awarded a Foundation Scholarship to Hulme Grammar School from Hulme's Charity. After graduation from Manchester University, he served in the army during the First World War, joining the Manchester Regiment as a 2nd Lieutenant from the Manchester University Contingent of the Officer Training Corps on 14 November 1914. He was promoted to temporary captain in September 1915. His medal card suggests he served in France and was awarded the Victory Medal and British War Medal.\n\nHis father (also a mosaic manufacturer in the family firm) served as a lieutenant in the London Regiment (Artists' Rifles) and died in 1916 having been gassed. Lehmann is buried in the Boulogne Eastern Cemetery (Grave ref VII. B. 11.).\n\nThough the London Gazette records the recruitment of \"Eric Newton Oppenheimer\", and promotion of \"Eric N. Oppenheimer\", it was after the war that he formally changed his name from Oppenheimer to his mother's maiden name of Newton, the latter sounding less German. He married his first wife, Isabel Aileen Vinicombe on 29 November 1915 at the Church of St James, Birch in Rusholme. the couple divorced in 1934 after which Newton married the fashion designer Stella Mary Pearce. The couple moved to London, living at 3 Cumberland Gardens. Newton died in his London office in 1965.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "476217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=476217", "title": "Guerrilla Girls", "text": "Guerrilla Girls\n\nGuerrilla Girls is an anonymous group of feminist, female artists devoted to fighting sexism and racism within the art world. The group formed in New York City in 1985 with the mission of bringing gender and racial inequality into focus within the greater arts community. The group employs culture jamming in the form of posters, books, billboards, and public appearances to expose discrimination and corruption. To remain anonymous, members don gorilla masks and use pseudonyms that refer to deceased female artists. According to GG1, identities are concealed because issues matter more than individual identities, \"[M]ainly, we wanted the focus to be on the issues, not on our personalities or our own work.\"\n\nIn the spring of 1985, seven women launched the Guerrilla Girls in response to the Museum of Modern Art's exhibition \"An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture\" [1984), whose roster of 165 artists included only 13 women. Inaugurating MoMA's newly renovated and expanded building, this exhibition claimed to survey that era's most important painters and sculptors from 17 countries. The proportion of artists of color was even smaller, and none of them were women. \nA comment by the show's curator, Kynaston McShine, further highlights that era's explicit art world gender bias: \"Kynaston McShine gave interviews saying that any artist who wasn't in the show should rethink his career.\" In reaction to the exhibition and McShine's overt bias, they protested in front of MoMA. Thus, the Guerrilla Girls were born.\n\nWhen the protests yielded little success, the Guerrilla Girls wheat-pasted posters throughout downtown Manhattan, particularly in the SoHo and East Village neighborhoods.\n\nSoon after, the group expanded their focus to include racism in the art world, attracting artists of color. They also took on projects outside of New York, enabling them to address sexism and racism nationally and internationally. Though the art world has remained the group's main focus, the Guerrilla Girls' agenda has included sexism and racism in films, mass and popular culture, and politics. Tokenism also represents a major group concern.\n\nDuring its first years, the Guerrilla Girls conducted \"weenie counts,\" such that members visited institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of Art and counted artworks' male-to-female subject ratios. Data gathered from the Met's public collections in 1989 showed that women artists had produced less than 5% of the works in the Modern Art Department, while 85% of the nudes were female.\nEarly organizing was based around meetings, during which members evaluated statistical data gathered regarding gender inequality within the New York City's art scene. The Guerrilla Girls also worked closely with artists, encouraging them to speak to those within the community to bridge the gender gap where they perceived it.\n\nWhen asked about the masks, the girls answer \"We were Guerrillas before we were Gorillas. From the beginning the press wanted publicity photos. We needed a disguise. No one remembers, for sure, how we got our fur, but one story is that at an early meeting, an original girl, a bad speller, wrote 'Gorilla' instead of 'Guerrilla.' It was an enlightened mistake. It gave us our 'mask-ulinity.'\" In an interview with New York Times the Guerrilla Girls were quoted, \"Anonymous free speech is protected by the Constitution. You'd be surprised what comes out of your mouth when you wear a mask.\"\n\nSince 1985, the Guerrilla Girls have worked for an increased awareness of sexism and greater accountability on the part of curators, art dealers, collectors and critics. The group is credited, above all, with sparking dialogue, and bringing national and international attention to issues of sexism and racism within the arts.\n\nMany feminist artists in the 1970s dared to imagine that female artists could produce authentically and radically different art, undoing the prevailing visual paradigm. The pioneering feminist critic, Lucy Lippard curated an all-women exhibition in 1974, effectively protesting what most deemed a deeply flawed approach, that of merely assimilating women into the prevailing art system. Shaped by the 1970s women's movement, the Guerrilla Girls resolved to devise new strategies. Most noticeably, they realized that 1970s-era tools such as pickets and marches proved ineffective, as evidenced by how easily MoMA could ignore 200 protestors from the Women's Caucus for Art. \"We had to have a new image and a new kind of language to appeal to a younger generation of women,\" recalls one of the founding Guerrilla Girls, who goes by \"Liubov Popova.\" The Guerrilla Girls sought an alternative approach, one that would defeat views of the 1970s Feminist movements as man-hating, anti-maternal, strident, and humorless: Versed in poststructuralist theories, they adopted 1970s initiatives, but with a different language and style. Earlier feminists tackled grim and unfunny issues such as sexual violence, inspiring the Guerrilla Girls to keep their spirits intact by approaching their work with wit and laughter, thus preventing a backlash.\n\nThroughout their existence, the Guerrilla Girls have gained the most attention for their bold protest art.\nThe Guerrilla Girls' projects (mostly posters at first) express observations, concerns, and ideals regarding numerous social topics. Their art has always been fact-driven, and informed by the group's unique approach to data collection, such as \"weenie counts.\" To be more inclusive and to make their posters more eye-catching, the Guerrilla Girls tend to pair facts with humorous images. Although the Guerrilla Girls gained fame for wheat-pasting provocative campaign posters around New York City, the group has also enjoyed public commissions and indoor exhibitions.\n\nIn addition to posting posters around downtown Manhattan, they passed out thousands of small handbills based on their designs at various events. The first posters were mainly black and white fact-sheets, highlighting inequalities between male and female artists with regard to number of exhibitions, gallery representation and pay. Their posters revealed how sexist the art world was in comparison to other industries and to national averages. For example, in 1985 they printed a poster showing that the salary gap in the art world between men and women was starker than the United States average, proclaiming \"Women in America earn only 2/3 of what men do. Women artists earn only 1/3 of what men do.\" These early posters often targeted specific galleries and artists. Another 1985 poster listed the names of some of the most famous working artists, such as Bruce Nauman and Richard Serra. The poster asked \"What do these artists have in common?\" with the answer \"They allow their work to be shown in galleries that show no more than 10% of women or none at all.\"\nThe group were also activists for equal representation of women in institutional art, and highlighted artist Louise Bourgeois in their \"Advantages to Being a Women artist,\" poster in 1988 as one line read, \"Knowing your career might not pick up till after you're 80.\" Their pieces are also notable for their use of combative statements such as \"When racism and sexism are no longer fashionable, what will your art collection be worth?\"\"\n\nDearest Art Collector (1986)\nDearest Art Collector is a 560x430 mm screen-print on paper. This is one of thirty posters published in a portfolio entitled Guerrilla Girls Talk Back. This print is unusual in the portfolio in that it takes the form of an enlarged handwritten letter on baby pink paper. The extremely rounded cursive script crowned with a frowning flower exudes femininity, symbolizing the biting sarcasm for which the Guerrilla Girls were known for. The Guerrilla Girls sent this poster to well- known art collectors across the United States, pointing out how few works they owned by women artists. This send up of femininity is aimed at the expectation that, even when presenting a serious complaint, women should do so in a socially acceptable 'nice' way. \"We know that you feel terrible about this\" appeals to the feelings of the recipient. This piece was a commentary on how hard it is for female artists, and what lengths they must go through in order to be recognized and taken seriously. Women are constantly expected to perform a certain way and this print is the embodiment of how tumultuous it is for women all around the world to be recognized in the eyes of men with power. The group later transcribed it into other languages and sent it to collectors outside the U.S. A practical joke with serious implications, this poster is now (somewhat ironically) a collector's item.\n\nThe posters were rude; they named names and they printed statistics (and almost always cited the source of those statistics at the bottom, making them difficult to dismiss). They embarrassed people. In other words, they worked.\n\nThe Guerrilla Girls' first color poster, which remains the group's most iconic image, is the 1989 Metropolitan Museum poster, which used data from the group's first \"weenie count.\" In response to the overwhelming amount of female nudes counted in the Modern Art sections, the poster asks, sarcastically, \"Do women have to be naked to get into the Met. Museum?\". Next to the text is an image of the Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres painting La Grande Odalisque, one of the most famous female nudes in Western art history, with a gorilla head placed over the original face.\n\nIn 1990, the group designed a billboard featuring the Mona Lisa that was placed along the West Side Highway supported by the New York City public art fund. For one day, New York's MTA Bus Company also displayed bus advertisements with Met. Museum poster. Stickers also became popular calling cards representative of the group.\n\nThe Guerrilla Girls infiltrated the bathrooms of the newly opened Guggenheim Soho, placing stickers regarding female inequality on the walls. \nIn 1998, Guerrilla Girls West protested at the San Jose Museum of Art, over low representation of women artists.\n\nIn addition to researching and exposing sexism in the art world, the Guerrilla Girls have received commissions from numerous organizations and institutions, such as The Nation (2001), Fundación Bilbao Arte (2002), Istanbul Modern (2006) and Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art (2007). They have also partnered with Amnesty International, contributing pieces to a show under the organization's \"Protect the Human\" initiative.\n\nIn 2005, the group exhibited large-format posters \"Welcome to the Feminist Biennale\" at the Venice Biennale (the first in 110 years to be overseen by women), scrutinizing 101 years of Biennale history in terms of diversity. \"Where Are the Women Artists of Venice?\" explored the fact that most works owned by Venice's historical museums are kept in storage.\n\nSince 2005, the Guerrilla Girls have been invited to produce special projects for international institutions, sometimes for the very institutions they have criticized. Offers that pose a dilemma are carefully considered, so as to avoid censure, since one way to improve institutions is to criticize them from inside.\n\nTheir 2006 poster \"The Future For Turkish Women Artists as Revealed by the Guerrilla Girls\", commissioned by Istanbul Modern, demonstrated that the status of women artists in Turkey was better than in Europe. In 2007, the Washington Post published their \"Horror on the National Mall!\", a one-page newspaper spread attacking the absence of diversity among tax-payer supported museums on the Mall in Washington, DC. During the 2007 ART-ATHINA, the Guerrilla Girls projected \"Dear Art Collector\" in Greek onto the entrance's façade. In 2015, they projected their \"Dear Art Collector\" animation onto a museum façade, taking on collectors who fail to pay employees a living wage.\nTo commemorate the 20th Anniversary of the École Polytechnique massacre, the University of Quebec commissioned their \"Troubler Le Repos\" (Disturbing The Peace) poster, whose texts addressed anti-women hate-speech since Ancient Greece to Rush Limbaugh.\n\nIn 2009, they launched \"I'm not a feminist, but If I were this is what I'd complain about ... \", an interactive graffiti wall that enables women who don't see themselves as feminists the means to target gender issues with the hope that active participation will broaden their perspectives. In 2012, this traveled to Krakòw's Art Boom Festival.\n\nIn 2012, an advertising truck towed \"Do women Have To Be Naked To Get Into Boston Museums?\" around Boston. Invited by Yoko Ono to participate in the 2013 Meltdown Festival, the Guerrilla Girls updated their 2003 \"Estrogen Bomb\" poster, which had premiered in The Village Voice in 2003.\n\nDuring Winter 2016, they participated in \"Twin City Takeover,\" art exhibitions and art projects organized by a consortium of local art organizations sited around Minneapolis and St. Paul.\n\nTo protest the dearth of female directors, the Guerrilla Girls distributed stickers during the 2001 Sundance Film Festival. The Nation invited them to \npresent \"Birth of Feminism\", which they updated and presented in 2007 as a banner outside Witte de With Center for Contemporary Arts. Since 2002, Guerrilla Girls Inc. have designed and installed billboards during the Oscars that address white male dominance in the film industry, such as: \"Anatomically Correct Oscars,\" \"Even the Senate is More Progressive than Hollywood,\" \"The Birth of Feminism,\" \"Unchain the Women Directors.\"\n\nDuring the 2015 Reykjavik Arts Festival, the Guerrilla Girls displayed \"National Film Quiz\", a billboard criticizing the fact that 87% of national funding for films goes to men, despite women playing an important part of Iceland's public and private sectors. \nIn light of 2016's #Oscarssowhite campaign, the Guerrilla Girls updated the above billboards, presenting them on downtown Minneapolis streets for \"Twin City Takeover.\"\n\nAlthough the Guerrilla Girls' protest art directed at the art world remains their most well-known work, throughout their existence the group has periodically targeted politicians, specifically conservative Republicans. Those criticized have included George Bush, Newt Gingrich, and most recently Michele Bachmann. In 1991, the Artist and Homeless Collaborative invited them to work with homeless women to create posters in response to homelessness and the first Gulf War. \nBetween 1992 and 1994, Guerrilla Girl posters addressed the 1992 Presidential election, reproductive rights (done for march on Washington in 1992), gay and lesbian rights, and the LA riots. During the 2012 election, they displayed their \"Even Michele Bachman believes. ... \" on a billboard adjacent a football stadium to advertise her plan to: ban same-sex marriages, require Voter Id Checks, and spend money implementing statewide voter IDs. Their 2013 posters discussed the Homeland Terror Alert system and Arnold Schwarzenegger's gubernatorial campaign.\n\nIn 2016, the Guerrilla Girls launched the \"President Trump Announces New Commemorative Months\" campaign in the form of stickers and posters, which they distributed during the \"Women's March on Washington\" in LA and NYC, as well as the J20 event at the Whitney Museum of Art and the Fire Fink protest at MoMA.\n\nTo shed light on inequality in the art world, the Guerrilla Girls have published numerous books. In 1995, they published their first book, \"Confessions of the Guerrilla Girls,\" a compilation of 50 works plus a self-interview. In 1998, they published \"The Guerrilla Girls Bedside Companion to the History of Western Art\", a consciousness-raising comic book that sold 82,000 copies, as it explores how art history's male domination constrained several female artists' careers. In 2003, they published \"Bitches, Bimbos and Ballbreakers\", a down and dirty catalogue of \"The Top Stereotypes from Cradle to Grave.\" Offering thumbnail histories for cultural clichés ranging from \"Daddy's Girl,\" \"the Girl Next Door,\" \"the Bimbo/Dumb Blonde\" to \"the Bitch /Ballbreaker\", each is given \"trademark Guerrilla Girl treatment: pointed factoids and cool graphics.\"\n\nTheir 2004 book \"The Guerrilla Girl's Museum Activity Book\" (reissued in 2012) parodies children's museum activity books. Meant to teach children how to both appreciate and critique museums, this book provides activities that reveal the problematic aspects of museum culture and major museum collections. In 2009, they published a history of hysteria, \"The Hysterical Herstory Of Hysteria And How It Was Cured From Ancient Times Until Now\". MFC-Michèle Didier reprinted it in 2011 and 2016.\n\nAn important part of Guerrilla Girls' outreach since 1985 has been presentations and workshops at colleges, universities, art organizations and sometimes at museums. The presentations, known as \"gigs\", attract hundreds and sometimes thousands of attendees. In the gig, they play music, videos, show slides and talk about the history of their work, how it has evolved. At the end the GGs interact with audience members. New work is always included and gig material changes all the time. They have done hundreds of these events and have travelled to nearly every state as well as Europe, South America and Australia.\n\nIn recognition of their work, the Guerrilla Girls have been invited to give talks at world-renowned museums, including a presentation at the MoMA's 2007 \"Feminist Futures\" Symposium. They have also been invited to speak at art schools and universities across the globe, and gave a 2010 commencement speech at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.\nTo mark the 30th anniversary of the Guerrilla Girls, Matadero Madrid hosted \"Guerrilla Girls: 1985-2015,\" an exhibition featuring most of the collective's production accompanied by a series of events including a talk/performance by Guerrilla Girl members Frida Kahlo and Käthe Kollwitz. The exhibition also showed the 1992 documentary \"Guerrilla in Our Midst\" by Amy Harrison.\nThree Guerrilla Girls appeared on the Stephen Colbert show on January 14, 2016.\n\nEarly solo exhibitions included: \"The Night the Palladium Apologized\" (1985), Palladium (New York City); \"Guerrilla Girls Review the Whitney\" (1987), Clocktower PS1; and \"Guerrilla Girls\" (1995), Printed Matter, Inc\n\nCareer surveys include: \n\nOn the heels of \"Not Ready to Make Nice\" were: \n\nDespite having routinely challenged art institutions to display more artists of color, both members and critics want the Guerrilla Girls to be more diverse. Zora Neale Hurston recalls Guerrilla Girl membership as \"mostly white\" and largely mirroring the art world demographics that they critiqued. Despite sporting gorilla masks to downplay personal identity, some members attribute Guerilla Girl interests to the fact that de facto leaders \"Frida Kahlo\" and \"Kathe Kollwitz\" are both white. (\"Frida Kahlo\" has also been criticized for her appropriation of a Latina artist's name.) However, any precise information on the demographics of the Guerrilla Girls is impossible, for they have \"staunchly, and problematically, resisted being surveyed as to the makeup of their own membership.\"\n\nSeveral Guerrilla Girls who are people of color have faced numerous challenges. Despite the Guerrilla Girls' stance against tokenism, some artists of color abandoned Guerrilla Girl membership due to tokenism, silencing, disrespect, and whitewashing. As a woman of color, \"Alma Thomas\" describes having felt uncomfortable wearing the Guerrilla Girls' signature gorilla mask. \"Thomas\" recalls little effort being devoted to understanding the challenges of artists of color. \"Their whiteness was such that they. ... didn't understand that blacks were being put in a completely separate world in the art world, that black male artists and black female artists are completely separated, completely segregated to this day.\" Ultimately, this widespread antagonism led to many \"artists of color [leaving] after a few meetings because they could sense the unspoken hierarchy in the group.\"\n\nEmerging at the tail end of the second-wave feminist movement, the Guerrilla Girls navigated the differences between established and emerging feminist theory during the 1980s. \"Alma Thomas\" describes this grey-area that the Guerrilla Girls occupied as \"universalist feminism,\" bordering on essentialism. Art Historian Anna Chave considers the Guerrilla Girls' essentialism much more profound, leading the group to be \"assailed by ... a rising generation of women wise in the ways of poststructuralist theory, for [their] putative naiveté and susceptibility to essentialism.\" Essentialist views are most clearly exhibited in two Guerrilla Girl books:\"The Guerrilla Girls Bedside Companion to the History of Western Art\" (1998) and the controversial \"Estrogen Bomb\" (2003–13) campaign. Regarding the former, \"Alma Thomas\" worried that \"The Guerrilla Girls Bedside Companion to the History of Western Art\" \"was so embedded in that second-wave feminist and even pre-second-wave essentialism\" that it fulfilled some assumption that all women artists are feminist artists.\n\nStudents at Minneapolis College of Art and Design criticized their \"Estrogen Bomb\" poster campaign, describing it as insensitive towards transgender people since it ties the female gender to estrogen, the same sort of essentialist link the Guerilla Girls aim to critique. Aside from essentialism, the Guerrilla Girls have also been critiqued for failing to integrate intersectionality into their work.\n\nLeading up to a highly publicized 2003 lawsuit, there was increasing animosity toward \"Frida Kahlo\" and \"Käthe Kollwitz.\" Despite founding members' initial intention to create a non-hierarchal, equitable power structure, there was an increasing sense that two people were making \"the final decisions no matter what you said.\" Several Guerrilla Girls felt that their second book, \"The Guerrilla Girls Bedside Companion to the History of Western Art\", primarily represented the views of \"Kahlo\" and \"Kollwitz\". Some even felt that \"Kahlo\" and \"Kollwitz\" completely controlled the book, despite their having selected material created collectively by all Guerrilla Girls. There was even suspicion that these two not only claimed all the credit, but took all of the profits. Some members condemned the book as \"undemocratic and ... against the spirit of the [Guerrilla] Girls.\"\n\nAs the Guerilla Girls gained in popularity, tensions led to what the Girls later called the \"banana split,\" as five members actually split from the collective. Soon after several members stepped aside to form Guerrilla Girls Broadband, \"Kahlo\" and \"Kollwitz\" moved to trademark the name \"Guerrilla Girls, Inc.\" to distinguish their realm from those of Guerrilla Girls BroadBand and Guerrilla Girls On Tour!, whose focus is discrimination in the theater world. Even though their former colleague \"Gertrude Stein\" was in the on-tour group, \"Kahlo\" and \"Kollwitz\" charged them with copyright and trademark infringement and unjust enrichment. Many members of the group felt especially betrayed that \"Kahlo\" and \"Kollwitz\" had launched their lawsuit under their real names, Jerilea Zempel and Erika Rothenberg.\n\nThis prompted negative reactions from both current and former Guerrilla Girls, who objected to \"Kahlo\" and \"Kollwitz\" claiming responsibility for having created the collective effort, as well as the flippancy with which they exchanged their anonymity for legal standing.\n\nJudge Louis L. Stanton, who handled the case, rejected the \"bizarre\" suggestion that defendants sporting gorilla masks be allowed to testify in his courtroom. He also stated that \"Mundane court procedures for adjudicating legal rights and the ownership of property require direct and cross-examination of real persons with real addresses and attributes.\"\n\nIn their forty-five page complaint, \"Kahlo\" and \"Kollwitz\" described themselves as the group's \"guiding forces,\" even though the Guerrilla Girls were \"informally organized, [and] had no official hierarchy.\" Initially, they asked the court to stop Guerrilla Girls Broadband from calling themselves Guerrilla Girls and sought millions of dollars in damages. In 2006, they settled with the theatre group who agreed to go by Guerrilla Girls on Tour.\n\nUpon their 1985 debut, the Guerrilla Girls were \"lauded by the very establishment they sought to undermine.\" They have since exhibited at Tate Modern, Venice Biennale, Centre Pompidou, MoMA, which additionally grants them a broader audience for their concerns. Since then, this relationship has only intensified, as the Guerrilla Girls presented their exhibitions in museums and even allowed their works to be collected by hegemonic institutions. Although some have questioned the efficacy, if not hypocrisy, of the group's working within the system that they originally denigrated, few would challenge their decision to let the Getty Institute house their archives.\n\nMembership in the New York City group is by invitation only, based on relationships with current and past members, and one's involvement in the contemporary art world. A mentoring program was formed within the group, pairing a new member with an experienced Guerrilla Girl to bring them into the fold. Due to the lack of formality, the group is comfortable with individuals outside of their base claiming to be Guerrilla Girls; Guerrilla Girl 1 stated in a 2007 interview: \"It can only enhance us by having people of power who have been given credit for being a Girl, even if they were never a Girl.\" Men are not allowed to become Guerrilla Girls, but may support the group by assisting in promotional activities.\n\nGuerrilla Girls names are pseudonyms generally based on dead female artists. Members goes by names such as Kathe Kollwitz, Alma Thomas, Rosalba Carriera, Frida Kahlo, Alice Neel, Julia de Burgos, and Hannah Höch. Guerrilla Girls' \"Carriera\" is credited with the idea of using pseudonyms as a way to not forget female artists. Having read about Rosalba Carriera in a footnote of \"Letters on Cézanne\" by Rainer Maria Rilke, she decided to pay tribute to the little-known female artist with her name. This also helped to solve the problem of media interviews; the group was often interviewed by phone and would not give names, causing problems and confusion amongst the group and the media. Guerrilla Girl 1 joined in the late 1980s, taking on her name as a way to memorialize women in the art community who have fallen under the radar and did not make as notable as an impact as the names takes on by other members.\n\nThe idea to adopt the gorilla as the group's symbol stemmed from a spelling error. One of the first Guerrilla Girls accidentally spelled the group's name at a meeting as \"gorilla.\" Despite the fact that the idea of using a gorilla as group symbol might have been accidental, the choice is nevertheless pertinent to the group's overall message in several key ways.\n\nTo begin with, the gorilla in popular culture and media is often associated with King Kong, or other images of trapped and tamed apes. In the 2010 SAIC Commencement, the comparison between institutionalized artists and tamed apes was explicitly made:\n\nThe gorilla is also typically associated with masculinity. The Met. Museum poster is in part shocking because of its juxtaposition of the eroticized female odalisque body, and the large, snarling gorilla head. The addition of the head detracts from the male gaze and changes the way in which viewers are able to look at or understand the highly sexualized image. Further, the addition of the gorilla questions and modifies stereotypical notions of female beauty within Western art and popular culture, another stated goal of the Guerrilla Girls. \n\nGuerrilla Girls, who wear the masks of big, hairy, powerful jungle creatures whose beauty is hardly conventional ... believe all animals, large and small, are beautiful in their own way.\n\nThough this goal has never been explicitly stated by the group, in the history of Western art, primates have often been associated with the visual arts, and with the figure of the artist. The idea of \"ars simia naturae\" (\"art the ape of nature\") maintains that the job of art is to \"ape\", or faithfully copy and represent nature. This was an idea first popularized by Renaissance thinker Giovanni Boccaccio who alleged that \"the artist in imitating nature only follows Nature's own command.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Schwarz was Jewish and was forced to leave Austria in 1938 when the Nazis took over and he went into exile in Britain.\n\nSchwarz was born in Vienna to Jewish parents. His mother died when he was 12 years old, two years before he entered art school in Vienna. With the Anschluss, in 1938, Schwarz was forced to abandon his studies. Shortly, afterwards he left Austria aboard a Kindertransport and made his way to England. His father, a bank clerk, failed to escape Vienna and later died in the Auschwitz concentration camp.\n\nArriving in England, the young Schwarz worked as a labourer for a year at Bournville before he was interned on the Isle of Man as an enemy alien. When he was released from internment in 1941, Schwarz enrolled at the Birmingham College of Art and studied there until 1943. Schwarz then spent two years working in a commercial art studio before, when the Second World War ended, establishing himself as a freelance commercial illustrator. He completed several murals for public buildings and also some work for the 1951 Festival of Britain. For almost twenty years Schwarz worked for several high-profile clients, including Shell, the Post Office and BOAC, until in 1964 he decided to concentrate full-time on his painting and sculpture. In 1966 Schwarz and his family moved to Somerset, from Hampstead, where he expanded the range of his work, painting more landscapes, undertaking more sculptures and using watercolours for the first time.\nFrom 1970 until his death, Schwarz lived and worked in Greenwich and produced some of his finest work at his studio there. In 1984 the National Portrait Gallery commissioned Schwarz to produce a group portrait of several trade union leaders. The resulting picture of Joe Gormley, Sid Weighell and Tom Jackson in Trafalgar Square with pigeons flying around them is possibly his best known work. Other notable portraits by Schwarz from this period include depictions of Janet Suzman, Nikolaus Pevsner and the poet Ivor Cutler. From Greenwich, Schwarz painted several urban landscapes often featuring the streets in his immediate vicinity but also Canary Wharf and the Isle of Dogs. Schwarz wrote several books on artistic techniques and, with his wife Lena, a book on the Halesowen district of the West Midlands.\n\nIn 1981, Schwarz won the Hunting Art Prize for a watercolour painting. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s he held a number of well-received exhibitions at commercial galleries. These included a series at the Thackeray Gallery and individual shows at the Compton Gallery in 1983, the Ben Uri Gallery in 1985, the Woodlands Art Gallery in 1991, the Sternberg Centre in 1992 and the New Academy Gallery in both 1995 and 2001. The auction house Bonhams sold the contents of his studio in 2004.\n\n\nSchwarz was a member or affiliated with the following organisations:\n"}

The book was featured in Herbert Spencer's \"Typographica\" (Old Series, number 16, 1959) in and \"Eye\" magazine (no. 47, vol. 12, Spring 2003). In Rick Poynor's \"Typographica\" he translates the Dutch title as \"Capitals, twin- and multi-print.\" \n\nThere were three principles in van den Bergh's proposals.

{"id": "9206479", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9206479", "title": "Insular art", "text": "Insular art\n\nInsular art, also known as Hiberno-Saxon art, is the style of art produced in the post-Roman history of Ireland and Britain. The term derives from \"insula\", the Latin term for \"island\"; in this period Britain and Ireland shared a largely common style different from that of the rest of Europe. Art historians usually group insular art as part of the Migration Period art movement as well as Early Medieval Western art, and it is the combination of these two traditions that gives the style its special character.\n\nMost Insular art originates from the Irish monastic movement of Celtic Christianity, or metalwork for the secular elite, and the period begins around 600 with the combining of Celtic and Anglo-Saxon styles. One major distinctive feature is interlace decoration, in particular the interlace decoration as found at Sutton Hoo, in East Anglia, which is now applied to decorating new types of objects mostly copied from the Mediterranean world, above all the codex or book. \n\nThe finest period of the style was brought to an end by the disruption to monastic centres and aristocratic life of the Viking raids which began in the late 8th century. These are presumed to have interrupted work on the Book of Kells, and no later Gospel books are as heavily or finely illuminated as the masterpieces of the 8th century. In England the style merged into Anglo-Saxon art around 900, whilst in Ireland the style continued until the 12th century, when it merged into Romanesque art. Ireland, Scotland and the kingdom of Northumbria in northern England are the most important centres, but examples were found also in southern England, Wales and in Continental Europe, especially Gaul (modern France), in centres founded by the Hiberno-Scottish mission and Anglo-Saxon missions. The influence of insular art affected all subsequent European medieval art, especially in the decorative elements of Romanesque and Gothic manuscripts.\n\nSurviving examples of Insular art are mainly illuminated manuscripts, metalwork and carvings in stone, especially stone crosses. Surfaces are highly decorated with intricate patterning, with no attempt to give an impression of depth, volume or recession. The best examples include the Book of Kells, Lindisfarne Gospels, Book of Durrow, brooches such as the Tara Brooch and the Ruthwell Cross. Carpet pages are a characteristic feature of Insular manuscripts, although historiated initials (an Insular invention), canon tables and figurative miniatures, especially Evangelist portraits, are also common.\n\nThe term was derived from its use for Insular script, first cited by the \"OED\" in 1908, and is also used for the group of Insular Celtic languages by linguists. Initially used mainly to describe the style of decoration of illuminated manuscripts, which are certainly the most numerous type of major surviving objects using the style, it is now used more widely across all the arts. It has the advantage of recognising the unity of styles across the Britain and Ireland, while avoiding the use of the term \"British Isles\", a sensitive topic in Ireland, and also circumventing arguments about the origins of the style, and the place of creation of specific works, which were often fierce in the 20th century. Some sources distinguish between a \"wider period between the 5th and 11th centuries, from the departure of the Romans to the beginnings of the Romanesque style\" and a \"more specific phase from the 6th to 9th centuries, between the conversion to Christianity and the Viking settlements\". C. R. Dodwell, on the other hand, says that in Ireland \"the Insular style continued almost unchallenged until the Anglo-Norman invasion of 1170; indeed examples of it occur even as late as the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries\".\n\nThe Insular style is most famous for its highly dense, intricate and imaginative decoration, which takes elements from several earlier styles. Late Iron Age Celtic art or \"Ultimate La Tène\", gave the love of spirals, triskeles, circles and other geometric motifs. These were combined with animal forms probably mainly deriving from the Germanic version of the general Eurasian animal style, though also from Celtic art, where heads terminating scrolls were common. Interlace was used by both these traditions, as well as Roman art (for example in floor mosaics) and other possible influences such as Coptic art, and its use was taken to new levels in insular art, where it was combined with the other elements already mentioned. There is no attempt to represent depth in manuscript painting, with all the emphasis on a brilliantly patterned surface. In early works the human figure was shown in the same geometric fashion as animal figures, but reflections of a classical figure style spread as the period went on, probably mostly from the southern Anglo-Saxon regions, though northern areas also had direct contacts with the Continent. The origins of the overall format of the carpet page have often been related to Roman floor mosaics, Coptic carpets and manuscript paintings, without general agreement being reached among scholars.\n\nUnlike contemporary Byzantine art, and that of most major periods, insular art does not come from a society where common stylistic influences were spread across a great number of types of object in art, applied art and decorative art. Across all the islands society was effectively entirely rural, buildings were rudimentary, and architecture has no Insular style. Although related objects in many more perishable media certainly existed and have not survived, it is clear that both religious and secular Insular patrons expected individual objects of dazzling virtuousity, that were all the more dazzling because of the lack of visual sophistication in the world in which they were seen.\n\nEspecially in Ireland, the clerical and secular elites were often very closely linked; some Irish abbacies were held for generations among a small kin-group. Ireland was divided into very small \"kingdoms\", almost too many for historians to keep track of, whilst in Britain there was a smaller number of generally larger kingdoms. Both the Celtic (Irish and Pictish) and Anglo-Saxon elites had long traditions of metalwork of the finest quality, much of it used for the personal adornment of both sexes of the elite. The Insular style arises from the meeting of their two styles, Celtic and Anglo-Saxon animal style, in a Christian context, and with some awareness of Late Antique style. This was especially so in their application to the book, which was a new type of object for both traditions, as well as to metalwork.\n\nThe role of the Kingdom of Northumbria in the formation of the new style appears to have been pivotal. The northernmost Anglo-Saxon kingdom continued to expand into areas with Celtic populations, but often leaving those populations largely intact in areas such as Dál Riata, Elmet and the Kingdom of Strathclyde. The Irish monastery at Iona was established by Saint Columba (Colum Cille) in 563, when Iona was part of a Dál Riata that included territory in both Ireland and modern Scotland. Although the first conversion of a Northumbrian king, that of Edwin in 627, was effected by clergy from the Gregorian Mission to Kent, it was the Celtic Christianity of Iona that was initially more influential in Northumbria, founding Lindisfarne on the eastern coast as a satellite in 635. However Northumbria remained in direct contact with Rome and other important monastic centres were founded by Wilfrid and Benedict Biscop who looked to Rome, and at the Synod of Whitby it was the Roman practices that were upheld, while the Iona contingent walked out, not adopting the Roman Easter dating until 715.\n\nChristianity discouraged the burial of grave goods so that, at least from the Anglo-Saxons, we have a larger number of pre-Christian survivals than those from later periods. The majority of examples that survive from the Christian period have been found in archaeological contexts that suggest they were rapidly hidden, lost or abandoned. There are a few exceptions, notably portable shrines (\"cumdachs\") for books or relics, several of which have been continuously owned, mostly by churches on the Continent—though the Monymusk Reliquary has always been in Scotland. In general it is clear that most survivals are only by chance, and that we have only fragments of some types of object—in particular the largest and least portable. The highest quality survivals are either secular jewellery, the largest and most elaborate pieces probably for male wearers, or tableware or altarware in what were apparently very similar styles—some pieces cannot be confidently assigned between altar and royal dining-table. It seems possible, even likely, that the finest church pieces were made by secular workshops, often attached to a royal household, though other pieces were made by monastic workshops. The evidence suggests that Irish metalworkers produced most of the best pieces, however the finds from the royal burial at Sutton Hoo, from the far east of England and at the beginning of the period, are as fine in design and workmanship as any Irish pieces.\nThere are a number of large brooches, including several of comparable quality to the Tara brooch. Almost all of these are in the National Museum of Ireland, the British Museum, the National Museum of Scotland, or local museums in the islands. Each of their designs is wholly individual in detail, and the workmanship is varied in technique and superb in quality. Many elements of the designs can be directly related to elements used in manuscripts. Almost all of the many techniques known in metalwork can be found in Insular work. Surviving stones used in decoration are semi-precious ones, with amber and rock crystal among the commonest, and some garnets. Coloured glass, enamel and millefiori glass, probably imported, are also used.\n\nThe Ardagh Chalice and the Derrynaflan Hoard of chalice, paten with stand, strainer, and basin (only discovered in 1980) are the most outstanding pieces of church metalware to survive (only three other chalices, and no other paten, survive). These pieces are thought to come from the 8th or 9th century, but most dating of metalwork is uncertain, and comes largely from comparison with manuscripts. Only fragments remain from what were probably large pieces of church furniture, probably with metalwork on wooden frameworks, such as shrines, crosses and other items. The Cross of Cong is a 12th-century Irish processional cross and reliquary that shows insular decoration, possibly added in a deliberately revivalist spirit. The gilt-bronze \"Athlone Crucifixion Plaque\" (National Museum of Ireland, perhaps 8th century) is much the best known of a group of nine recorded Irish metal plaques with \"Crucifixions\", and is comparable in style to figures on many high crosses; it may well have come from a book cover.\n\nThe fittings of a major abbey church in the insular period remain hard to imagine; one thing that does seem clear is that the most fully decorated manuscripts were treated as decorative objects for display rather than as books for study. The most fully decorated of all, the Book of Kells, has several mistakes left uncorrected, the text headings necessary to make the Canon tables usable have not been added, and when it was stolen in 1006 for its cover in precious metals, it was taken from the sacristy, not the library. The book was recovered, but not the cover, as also happened with the Book of Lindisfarne. None of the major insular manuscripts have preserved their elaborate jewelled metal covers, but we know from documentary evidence that these were as spectacular as the few remaining continental examples. The re-used metal back cover of the Lindau Gospels (now in the Morgan Library, New York) was made in southern Germany in the late 8th or early 9th? century, under heavy insular influence, and is perhaps the best indication as to the appearance of the original covers of the great insular manuscripts, although one gold and garnet piece from the Anglo-Saxon Staffordshire Hoard, found in 2009, may be the corner of a book-cover. The Lindau design is dominated by a cross, but the whole surface of the cover is decorated, with interlace panels between the arms of the cross. The cloisonné enamel shows Italian influence, and is not found in work from the Insular homelands, but the overall effect is very like a carpet page.\n\nAlthough many more examples survive than of large pieces of metalwork, the development of the style is usually described in terms of the same outstanding examples:\n\nCathach of St. Columba.\nAn Irish Latin psalter of the early 7th century, this is perhaps the oldest known Irish manuscript of any sort. It contains only decorated letters, at the beginning of each Psalm, but these already show distinctive traits. Not just the initial, but the first few letters are decorated, at diminishing sizes. The decoration influences the shape of the letters, and various decorative forms are mixed in a very unclassical way. Lines are already inclined to spiral and metamorphose, as in the example shown. Apart from black, some orange ink is used for dotted decoration. The classical tradition was late to use capital letters for initials at all (in Roman texts it is often very hard to even separate the words), and though by this time they were in common use in Italy, they were often set in the left margin, as though to cut them off from the rest of the text. The insular tendency for the decoration to lunge into the text, and take over more and more of it, was a radical innovation. The Bobbio Jerome which according to an inscription dates to before 622, from Bobbio Abbey, an Irish mission centre in northern Italy, has a more elaborate initial with colouring, showing Insular characteristics still more developed, even in such an outpost. From the same scriptorium and of similar date, the Bobbio Orosius has the earliest carpet page, although a relatively simple one.\nDurham Gospel Book Fragment.\nThe earliest painted Insular manuscript to survive, produced in Lindisfarne c. 650, but with only seven leaves of the book remaining, not all with illuminations. This introduces interlace, and also uses Celtic motifs drawn from metalwork. The design of two of the surviving pages relates them as a two-page spread\n\nBook of Durrow.\nThe earliest surviving Gospel Book with a full programme of decoration (though not all has survived): six extant carpet pages, a full-page miniature of the four evangelist's symbols, four full-page miniatures of the evangelists' symbols, four pages with very large initials, and decorated text on other pages. Many minor initial groups are decorated. Its date and place of origin remain subjects of debate, with 650–690 and Durrow in Ireland, Iona or Lindisfarne being the normal contenders. The influences on the decoration are also highly controversial, especially regarding Coptic or other Near Eastern influence.\n\nAfter large initials the following letters on the same line, or for some lines beyond, continue to be decorated at a smaller size. Dots round the outside of large initials are much used. The figures are highly stylised, and some pages use Germanic interlaced animal ornament, whilst others use the full repertoire of Celtic geometric spirals. Each page uses a different and coherent set of decorative motifs. Only four colours are used, but the viewer is hardly conscious of any limitation from this. All the elements of Insular manuscript style are already in place. The execution, though of high quality, is not as refined as in the best later books, nor is the scale of detail as small.\nLindisfarne Gospels\nProduced in Lindisfarne by Eadfrith, Bishop of Lindisfarne, between about 690 and his death in 721 (perhaps towards the end of this period), this is a Gospel Book in the style of the Book of Durrow, but more elaborate and complex. All the letters on the pages beginning the Gospels are highly decorated in a single composition, and many two-page openings are designed as a unit, with carpet pages facing an \"incipit\" (\"Here begins..\") initial page at the start of each Gospel. Eadfrith was almost certainly the scribe as well as the artist. There are four Evangelist portraits, clearly derived from the classical tradition but treated without any sense of depth; the borders around them are far plainer than the decoration of the text pages, and there is clearly a sense of two styles which Eadfrith does not attempt to integrate wholly. The carpet-pages are enormously complex, and superbly executed.\n\nLichfield Gospels\nLikely made in Lichfield around 730, this deluxe gospel-book contains eight major decorated pages, including a stunning cross-carpet page and portraits of the evangelists Mark and Luke. The gospels of Matthew and Mark and the beginning of Luke survives. From its time in Wales, pages include marginalia representing some of the earliest examples of Old Welsh writing. The manuscript has been at Lichfield Cathedral since the late 10th century, except for a brief period during the English Civil War. \n\nSt Petersburg Bede.\nAttributed to Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey in Northumbria between about 730–746, this contains larger opening letters in which metalwork styles of decoration can clearly be seen. There are thin bands of interlace within the members of letters. It also contains the earliest historiated initial, a bust probably of Pope Gregory I, which like some other elements of the decoration, clearly derives from a Mediterranean model. Colour is used, although in a relatively restrained way.\n\nBook of Kells\nUsually dated to around 800, although sometimes up to a century earlier, the place of origin is disputed between Iona and Kells, or other locations. It is also often thought to have been begun in Iona and then continued in Ireland, after disruption from Viking raids; the book survives nearly intact but the decoration is not finished, with some parts in outline only. It is far more comprehensively decorated than any previous manuscript in any tradition, with every page (except two) having many small decorated letters. Although there is only one carpet page, the \"incipit\" initials are so densely decorated, with only a few letters on the page, that they rather take over this function. Human figures are more numerous than before, though treated in a thoroughly stylised fashion, and closely surrounded, even hemmed in, by decoration as crowded as on the initial pages. A few scenes such as the \"Temptation\" and \"Arrest of Christ\" are included, as well as a Madonna and Child, surrounded by angels (the earliest Madonna in a Western book). More miniatures may have been planned or executed and lost. Colours are very bright and the decoration has tremendous energy, with spiral forms predominating. Gold and silver are not used.\n\nA distinctive Insular type of book is the pocket gospel book, inevitably much less decorated, but in several cases with Evangelist portraits and other decoration. Examples include the Book of Mulling, Book of Deer, Book of Dimma, and the smallest of all, the Stonyhurst Gospel (now British Library), a 7th-century Anglo-Saxon text of the Gospel of John, which belonged to St Cuthbert and was buried with him. Its beautifully tooled goatskin cover is the oldest Western bookbinding to survive, and a virtually unique example of insular leatherwork, in an excellent state of preservation.\n\nBoth Anglo-Saxon and Irish manuscripts have a distinctive rougher finish to their vellum, compared to the smooth-polished surface of contemporary continental and all late-medieval vellum. It appears that, in contrast to later periods, the scribes copying the text were often also the artists of the illuminations, and might include the most senior figures of their monastery.\n\nIn England the pull of a Continental style operated from very early on; the Gregorian mission from Rome had brought the St Augustine Gospels and other manuscripts now lost with them, and other books were imported from the continent early on. The 8th-century Cotton Bede shows mixed elements in the decoration, as does the Stockholm Codex Aureus of similar period, probably written in Canterbury. In the Vespasian Psalter it is clear which element is coming to dominate. All these and other members of the \"Tiberius\" group of manuscripts were written south of the river Humber, but the Codex Amiatinus, of before 716 from Jarrow, is written in a fine uncial script, and its only illustration is conceived in an Italianate style, with no insular decoration; it has been suggested this was only because the volume was made for presentation to the Pope. The dating is partly known from the grant of additional land secured to raise the generations of cattle, amounting to 2,000 head in all, which were necessary to make the vellum for three complete but unillustrated Bibles, which shows the resources necessary to make the large books of the period.\n\nMany Anglo-Saxon manuscripts written in the south, and later the north, of England show strong Insular influences until the 10th century or beyond, but the pre-dominant stylistic impulse comes from the continent of Europe; carpet-pages are not found, but many large figurative miniatures are. Panels of interlace and other Insular motifs continue to be used as one element in borders and frames ultimately classical in derivation. Many continental manuscripts, especially in areas influenced by the Celtic missions, also show such features well into the early Romanesque period. \"Franco-Saxon\" is a term for a school of late Carolingian illumination in north-eastern France that used insular-style decoration, including super-large initials, sometimes in combination with figurative images typical of contemporary French styles. The \"most tenacious of all the Carolingian styles\", it continued until as late as the 11th century.\n\nThe true legacy of insular art lies not so much in the specific stylistic features discussed above, but in its fundamental departure from the classical approach to decoration, whether of books or other works of art. The barely controllable energy of Insular decoration, spiralling across formal partitions, becomes a feature of later medieval art, especially Gothic art, in areas where specific Insular motifs are hardly used, such as architecture. The mixing of the figurative with the ornamental also remained characteristic of all later medieval illumination; indeed for the complexity and density of the mixture, Insular manuscripts are only rivalled by some 15th-century works of late Flemish illumination. It is also noticeable that these characteristics are always rather more pronounced in the north of Europe than the south; Italian art, even in the Gothic period, always retains a certain classical clarity in form.\n\nUnmistakable Insular influence can be seen in Carolingian manuscripts, even though these were also trying to copy the Imperial styles of Rome and Byzantium. Greatly enlarged initials, sometimes inhabited, were retained, as well as far more abstract decoration than found in classical models. These features continue in Ottonian and contemporary French illumination and metalwork, before the Romanesque period further removed classical restraints, especially in manuscripts, and the capitals of columns.\n\nLarge stone high crosses, usually erected outside monasteries or churches, first appear in the 8th century in Ireland, perhaps at Carndonagh, Donegal, a monastic site with Ionian foundations, apparently later than the earliest Anglo-Saxon crosses, which may be 7th-century. Later insular carvings found throughout Britain and Ireland were almost entirely geometrical, as was the decoration on the earliest crosses. By the 9th century figures are carved, and the largest crosses have very many figures in scenes on all surfaces, often from the Old Testament on the east side, and the New on the west, with a Crucifixion at the centre of the cross. The 10th-century Muiredach's High Cross at Monasterboice is usually regarded as the peak of the Irish crosses. In later examples the figures become fewer and larger, and their style begins to merge with the Romanesque, as at the Dysert Cross in Ireland.\n\nThe 8th-century Northumbrian Ruthwell Cross (now in Scotland), unfortunately damaged by Presbyterian iconoclasm, is the most impressive remaining Anglo-Saxon cross, though as with most Anglo-Saxon crosses the original cross head is missing. Many Anglo-Saxon crosses were much smaller and more slender than the Irish ones, and therefore only had room for carved foliage, but the Bewcastle Cross, Easby Cross and Sandbach Crosses are other survivals with considerable areas of figurative reliefs, with larger-scale figures than any early Irish examples. Even early Anglo-Saxon examples mix vine-scroll decoration of Continental origin with interlace panels, and in later ones the former type becomes the norm, just as in manuscripts. There is literary evidence for considerable numbers of carved stone crosses across the whole of England, and also straight shafts, often as grave-markers, but most survivals are in the northernmost counties. There are remains of other works of monumental sculpture in Anglo-Saxon art, even from the earlier periods, but nothing comparable from Ireland.\n\nThe stone monuments erected by the Picts of Scotland north of the Clyde-Forth line between the 6th–8th centuries are particularly striking in design and construction, carved in the typical Easter Ross style related to that of insular art, though with much less classical influence. In particular the forms of animals are often closely comparable to those found in Insular manuscripts, where they typically represent the Evangelist's symbols, which may indicate a Pictish origin for these forms, or another common source. The carvings come from both pagan and early Christian periods, and the Pictish symbols, which are still poorly understood, do not seem to have been repugnant to Christians. The purpose and meaning of the stones are only partially understood, although some think that they served as personal memorials, the symbols indicating membership of clans, lineages, or kindreds and depict ancient ceremonies and rituals Examples include the Eassie Stone and the Hilton of Cadboll Stone. It is possible that they had subsidiary uses, such as marking tribal or lineage territories. It has also been suggested that the symbols could have been some kind of pictographic system of writing.\n\nThere are also a few examples of similar decoration on Pictish silver jewellery, notably the Norrie's Law Hoard, of the 7th century or perhaps earlier, much of which was melted down on discovery, and the 8th-century St Ninian's Isle Hoard, with many brooches and bowls. The surviving items from both are now held by National Museums Scotland.\n\n\n\n"}

A line producer usually works on one film at a time. They are responsible for human resources and handling any problems that come up during production.\n\nAccording to Producers Guild of America (PGA) guidelines, the Line Producer is the individual who reports directly to the individual(s) receiving \"Produced By\" credit on the theatrical motion picture and is the single individual who has the primary responsibility for the logistics of the production, from pre-production through completion of production; all Department Heads report to the Line Producer.\n\nThe line producer functions like a chief operations officer in running the production company. During pre-production, responsibilities include supervising the assembly of the shooting company, recruitment of key personnel and services, and production organization for how to shoot the script and transform it into a movie. The line producer plans start dates for everyone and everything, and monitors the budget in the lead up to picture. Film production generally follows a rigorous schedule. The line producer facilitates casting, location scouting, set building and decorating, offices and stages, wardrobe, props, stunts, physical and visual effects, camera, lighting, rigging, transportation, cast, crew and union relations, travel, cast and crew accommodation, contracting of legal permissions and agreements, safety and risk management, prep and shooting schedule. In short, the line producer oversees the joint planning, negotiations, implementation and accounting for production.\n\nIn the studio system, the line producer reports to the studio and typically liaises with key executives of production divisions inside the studio such as physical production, legal, labor relations, insurance, and finance. The line producer supports the director's vision and direct influence on the creative expression or narrative of the film, Though it could be argued that, through a line producer's ability to influence aspects of the film, like allocation of resources to certain departments, they can change important aspects of the film that have creative consequences, e.g., production value. For example, they can affect the project's look by influencing the choice of filming locations. While the director is in charge of all purely artistic decisions, the line producer helps to substantiate the director's creative ideas by taking care of logistics and related issues. From pre-production through principal photography, the line producer oversees the production budget and physical needs of the shoot. By the first day of production, several versions of the budget have usually been drafted. A finalized or \"locked\" budget is the basis for the production to move forward. A key objective of a line producer is to respect this \"locked\" budget and deliver in time.\n\nWhile in production, the line producer oversees the execution of many decisions that must be made to deliver each day's shoot. The administrative aspects, especially those that have any financial impact, are all crucial areas of the line producer's work. These areas include but are not limited to negotiating compensation (usually during pre-production) of crew members (both for union and non-union productions) and resolving daily production issues (in conjunction with the first assistant director and possibly the unit production manager). Moreover, they provide demanded equipment. If required, they handle unanticipated scheduling changes and serve \"as a liaison between the crew and the producer.\"\n\nLine producers usually come from the ranks of assistant directors and unit production managers, giving them a strong background in the logistics of filmmaking and time management. It is common for them to continue to perform in one of those roles on projects they line produce. They do not necessarily attend a film school.\n\n"}

The theatre was inaugurated on 3 October 1886 with a performance of Gluck's \"Iphigénie en Aulide\" with Marie Wittich in the title role. The complex also includes the State Museum in Schwerin (\"Staatliche Museum Schwerin\") and a 240-seat concert hall, now used for performances of chamber works. All theatres were closed for the Autumn season of 1944, with the staff drafted wherever possible. By German WW2 standards wartime casualties and destruction by bombing in Schwerin were small, in spite of nightly RAF raids and the droning of massive bomber pulks as silver specks on the sky during the day on their way to Berlin. Americans were the first to enter the town in the spring of 1945, handing it over to the British until the Russians arrived.

{"id": "290763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=290763", "title": "Medieval literature", "text": "Medieval literature\n\nMedieval literature is a broad subject, encompassing essentially all written works available in Europe and beyond during the Middle Ages (that is, the one thousand years from the fall of the Western Roman Empire ca. AD 500 to the beginning of the Florentine Renaissance in the late 15th century). The literature of this time was composed of religious writings as well as secular works. Just as in modern literature, it is a complex and rich field of study, from the utterly sacred to the exuberantly profane, touching all points in-between. Works of literature are often grouped by place of origin, language, and genre.\n\nSince Latin was the language of the Roman Catholic Church, which dominated Western and Central Europe, and since the Church was virtually the only source of education, Latin was a common language for medieval writings, even in some parts of Europe that were never Romanized. However, in Eastern Europe, the influence of the Eastern Roman Empire and the Eastern Orthodox Church made Greek and Old Church Slavonic the dominant written languages.\n\nThe common people continued to use their respective vernaculars. A few examples, such as the Old English \"Beowulf\", the Middle High German \"Nibelungenlied\", the Medieval Greek \"Digenis Acritas\", the Old East Slavic \"Tale of Igor's Campaign\", and the Old French \"Chanson de Roland\", are well known to this day. Although the extant versions of these epics are generally considered the works of individual (but anonymous) poets, there is no doubt that they are based on their peoples' older oral traditions. Celtic traditions have survived in the lais of Marie de France, the \"Mabinogion\" and the Arthurian cycles. Another host of vernacular literature has survived in the Old Norse literature and more specifically in the Saga literature of Iceland.\n\nA notable amount of medieval literature is anonymous. This is not only due to the lack of documents from a period, but also due to an interpretation of the author's role that differs considerably from the romantic interpretation of the term in use today. Medieval authors often deeply respected the classical writers and the Church Fathers and tended to re-tell and embellish stories they had heard or read rather than invent new stories. And even when they did, they often claimed to be handing down something from an auctor instead. From this point of view, the names of the individual authors seemed much less important, and therefore many important works were never attributed to any specific person.\n\nTheological works were the dominant form of literature typically found in libraries during the Middle Ages. Catholic clerics were the intellectual center of society in the Middle Ages, and it is their literature that was produced in the greatest quantity.\n\nCountless hymns survive from this time period (both liturgical and paraliturgical). The liturgy itself was not in fixed form, and numerous competing missals set out individual conceptions of the order of the mass. Religious scholars such as Anselm of Canterbury, Thomas Aquinas, and Pierre Abélard wrote lengthy theological and philosophical treatises, often attempting to reconcile the teachings of the Greek and Roman pagan authors with the doctrines of the Church. Hagiographies, or \"lives of the saints\", were also frequently written, as an encouragement to the devout and a warning to others.\n\nThe \"Golden Legend\" of Jacobus de Voragine reached such popularity that, in its time, it was reportedly read more often than the Bible. Francis of Assisi was a prolific poet, and his Franciscan followers frequently wrote poetry themselves as an expression of their piety. \"Dies Irae\" and \"Stabat Mater\" are two of the most powerful Latin poems on religious subjects. Goliardic poetry (four-line stanzas of satiric verse) was an art form used by some clerics to express dissent. The only widespread religious writing that was not produced by clerics were the mystery plays: growing out of simple tableaux re-enactments of a single Biblical scene, each mystery play became its village's expression of the key events in the Bible. The text of these plays was often controlled by local guilds, and mystery plays would be performed regularly on set feast-days, often lasting all day long and into the night.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the Jewish population of Europe also produced a number of outstanding writers. Maimonides, born in Cordoba, Spain, and Rashi, born in Troyes, France, are two of the best-known and most influential of these Jewish authors.\n\nSecular literature in this period was not produced in equal quantity as religious literature. The earliest tales are based on oral traditions: the British \"Y Goddoddin\" and \"Preiddeu Annwfn\", along with the Germanic Beowulf and \"Nibelungenlied\". They relate to myths or certain 6th-century events, but the surviving manuscripts date from centuries later—\"Y Goddoddin\" from the late 13th century, \"Preiddu Annwfn\" from the early 14th century, \"Beowulf\" from c. 1000, and the \"Nibelungenlied\" from the 13th century. The makers and performers were \"bards\" (British/Welsh) and \"scops\" (Germanic), elite professionals attached to royal or noble courts to praise the heroes of legendary history.\n\nProse tales first emerged in Britain: the intricate \"Mabinogi\" quartet about princely families, notably anti-war in theme, and the romantic adventure \"Culhwch and Olwen\", famous for the earliest mention of King Arthur. (The \"Mabinogi\" is not the same as the \"Mabinogion\", a collection of disconnected prose tales, which does, however, include both the \"Mabinogi\" and \"Culhwch and Olwen\".) These works were compiled from earlier oral tradition c. 1100.\n\nAt about the same time a new poetry of \"courtly love\" became fashionable in Europe. Traveling singers—troubadours and trouvères—made a living from their love songs in French, Spanish, Galician-Portuguese, Catalan, Provençal, and Greek. Germanic culture had its Minnesänger tradition. The songs of courtly love often express unrequited longing for an ideal woman, but there are also aubades (dawn farewells by lovers) and humorous ditties.\n\nFollowing the earliest epic poems, prose tales, and romances, more long poems were crafted—the \"chansons de geste\" of the late 11th and early 12th centuries. These extolled conquests, as in \"The Song of Roland\" (part of the Matter of France) and \"Digenis Acritas\" (one of the Acritic songs). The rather different chivalric romance tradition concerns adventures about marvels, love, and chivalry. They tell of the Matter of Britain and the Matter of Rome.\n\nPolitical poetry threads throughout the period from the very early \"Armes Prydein\" (10th-century Britain) to the goliard rebels of 12th and 13th centuries, who were church trained clerics unable or unwilling to be employed in the church.\n\nTravel literature was highly popular in the Middle Ages, as fantastic accounts of far-off lands (frequently embellished or entirely false) entertained a society that supported sea voyages and trading along coasts and rivers, as well as pilgrimages to such destinations as Jerusalem; Canterbury and Glastonbury in England; St. David's in Wales; and Santiago de Compostela in Spain. Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\" became popular at the end of the 14th century.\n\nThe most prominent authors of Jewish secular poetry in the Middle Ages were Solomon ibn Gabirol and Yehuda Halevi, both of whom were also renowned religious poets.\n\nWhile it is true that women in the medieval period were never accorded full equality with men, some women were able to use their skill with the written word to gain renown. Religious writing was the easiest avenue—women who would later be canonized as saints frequently published their reflections, revelations, and prayers. Much of what is known about women in the Middle Ages is known from the works of nuns such as Clare of Assisi, Bridget of Sweden, and Catherine of Siena.\n\nFrequently, however, the religious perspectives of women were held to be unorthodox by those in power, and the mystical visions of such authors as Julian of Norwich, Mechthild of Magdeburg, and Hildegard of Bingen provide insight into a part of the medieval experience less comfortable for the institutions that ruled Europe at the time. Women wrote influential texts in the secular realm as well—reflections on courtly love and society by Marie de France and Christine de Pizan continue to be studied for their glimpses of medieval society.\n\nFor modern historical reflection, D.H. Green's (2007) historical work entitled, \"Women Readers of the Middle Ages\" explores literacy and literature in terms of women in medieval society. The book has been reviewed as \"a radical reassessment of women's contribution to medieval literary culture.\" \n\nWhile medieval literature makes use of many literary devices, allegory is so prominent in this period as to deserve special mention. Much of medieval literature relied on allegory to convey the morals the author had in mind while writing—representations of abstract qualities, events, and institutions are thick in much of the literature of this time. Probably the earliest and most influential allegory is the \"Psychomachia\" (\"Battle of Souls\") by Aurelius Clemens Prudentius. Other important examples include the \"Romance of the Rose\", \"Everyman\", \"Piers Plowman\", \"Roman de Fauvel\", and \"The Divine Comedy\".\n\n\n\n"}

Members of the initial cast include: Boris Kodjoe, Nelly, Duane Martin, J.B. Smoove, Nick Cannon, Oliver (Hart's assistant, played by James Davis), and Robin Thicke, who did not return for the second season due to his music career, though Hart has stated that the door is open for Thicke to return.\n\nThe series is intentionally filmed in a style similar to Bravo's \"The Real Housewives\". Episodes often hinge on the \"real\" Kevin Hart's desperately unsuccessful attempts to climb Hollywood's celebrity social ladder (which always backfire in humiliating ways), and the character's barely-hidden jealousy of his more successful celebrity friends. A sneak peek was shown as a segment during the 2012 BET Awards and the official promo was released in October 2012.\n\nSpecial guests during the first season include: Laila Ali, Ed O'Neill, Jennifer Freeman, Russell Simmons, Melanie Fiona, Estelle, Cedric the Entertainer, Shane Mosley, Elise Neal, Keri Hilson, La La Anthony, Rocsi Diaz, Alec Mapa, Terry Crews, Tisha Campbell-Martin, Takhorra Taylor, Young Jeezy, Nicole Ari Parker, Jay Leno, Ed O'Neill, Shaquille O'Neal, Faizon Love, James Davis, Common and Trey Songz.\n\nSeason 2 guest stars include Chris Rock, Conan O'Brien, Wanda Sykes, Katie Couric, Keenen Ivory Wayans, Nadine Velazquez, Kelly Rowland, Bobby Brown, Ralph Tresvant, Tichina Arnold, James Davis, Wayne Brady, Eric Benet, Selita Ebanks, Eva Marcille, Erykah Badu, and more.\n\nSeason 3: Tamar Braxton, Mariah Carey, Regina Hall, Sanaa Lathan, George Lopez, Snoop Dogg, Jennifer Freeman, Lance Bass, Chrisette Michele, Jessica White, Fred Williamson, and more.\n\nSeason 4: Bobby Shmurda, Chris Brown, Brandy, Nia Long, Arsenio Hall, Wayne Brady, Mary J.

{"id": "323245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=323245", "title": "Silversmith", "text": "Silversmith\n\nA silversmith is a craftsman who crafts objects from silver. The terms \"silversmith\" and \"goldsmith\" are not exactly synonyms as the techniques, training, history, and guilds are or were largely the same but the end product may vary greatly as may the scale of objects created. However most goldsmiths have also worked in silver although the reverse may not be the case.\n\nSilversmithing is the art of turning silver sheet metal into hollow ware (dishes, bowls, porringers, cups, candlesticks, vases, ewers, urns, etc.), flatware (silverware), and other articles of household silver, church plate or sculpture. It may also include the making of jewelry.\n\nIn the ancient Near East the value of silver to gold being less, allowed a silversmith to produce objects and store these as stock. Ogden states that according to an edict written by Diocletian in 301 A.D., a silversmith was able to charge 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, or 300 \"denarii\" for material produce (per Roman pound). At that time, guilds of silversmiths formed to arbitrate disputes, protect its members' welfare and educate the public of the trade.\n\nSilversmiths in medieval Europe and England formed guilds and transmitted their tools and techniques to new generations via the apprentice tradition. Silver working guilds often maintained consistency and upheld standards at the expense of innovation. Beginning in the 17th century, artisans emigrated to America and experienced fewer restrictions. As a result, silver working was one of the trades that helped to inaugurate the shift to industrialization in America.\n\nVery exquisite and distinctly designed silverware, that goes by the name of Swami Silver, emerged from the stable of watchmaker turned silversmith P Orr and Sons in the South Indian city of Madras (now Chennai) during the British rule in 1875.\n\nThe Falasha Clan , or Beta Israel, of Ethiopia were known for their silversmithing skills.\n\nSilversmiths saw or cut specific shapes from sterling and fine silver sheet metal and bar stock, and then use hammers to form the metal over anvils and stakes. Silver is hammered cold (at room temperature). As the metal is hammered, bent, and worked, it 'work-hardens'. Annealing is the heat-treatment used to make the metal soft again. If metal is work-hardened, and not annealed occasionally, the metal will crack and weaken the work.\n\nSilversmiths can use casting techniques to create knobs, handles and feet for the hollowware they are making.\n\nAfter forming and casting, the various pieces may be assembled by soldering and riveting.\n\nDuring most of their history, silversmiths used charcoal or coke fired forges, and lung-powered blow-pipes for soldering and annealing. Modern silversmiths commonly use gas burning torches as heat sources. A newer method is laser beam welding.\n\nSilversmiths may also work with copper and brass, especially when making practice pieces, due to those materials having similar working properties and being more affordable than silver.\n\nAlthough jewelers also work in silver and gold, and many of the techniques for working precious metals overlap, the trades of jeweler and Silversmith have distinct histories.\nChain-making and gem-setting are common practices of jewelers that are not usually considered aspects of silversmiths.\n\nThe tradition of making (iron / plate) armor was interrupted sometime after the 17th century. Silversmithing and goldsmithing, by contrast, have an unbroken tradition going back many millennia. The techniques used to make armor today (whether for movies or for historical recreation groups) are an amalgam of silversmith forming techniques and blacksmith iron-handling techniques.\n\nIn the western Canadian silversmith tradition, guilds do not exist; however, mentoring through colleagues becomes a method of professional learning within a community of craftspersons.\n\nIn the native Canadian western tradition, silversmithing is done through hand tooling and bright cut engraving of silver. There are silversmiths who only make jewellery and there are silversmiths who only make utensils.\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n"}

Home to the Chicago Symphony Orchestra; Chicago Symphony Chorus; Civic Orchestra of Chicago; and the Institute for Learning, Access, and Training; Symphony Center includes the 2,522-seat Orchestra Hall, which dates from 1904; Buntrock Hall, a rehearsal and performance space; Grainger Ballroom, an event space overlooking Michigan Avenue and the Art Institute of Chicago; a public multi-story rotunda; tesori restaurant; and administrative offices. In June 1993, plans to significantly renovate and expand Orchestra Hall were approved and the $110 million project resulting in Symphony Center began in 1995 and was completed in 1997. \n\nOrchestra Hall was designated a National Historic Landmark on April 19, 1994. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1978.\n\nBuilt in 1904, Orchestra Hall was designed by renowned Chicago architect Daniel Burnham. The new hall was specifically designed as a home for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, which had previously performed in the larger Auditorium Theater. Construction began on May 1, 1904, and the first concert was given on December 14, 1904. The building has \"Theodore Thomas Orchestra Hall\" inscribed in its façade, after the orchestra's first music director who died less than a month after his conducting debut there. The names Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, and Wagner are inscribed above the ballroom windows on the façade.\n\nFrom 1907 through 1996 the ninth-floor penthouse of the building served as the home of the Cliff Dwellers Club, with interior architecture by Howard Van Doren Shaw and the first significant mural of John Warner Norton.\n\nOrchestra Hall was also used as a movie theater during the 1910s, to maintain income during the summer months, when the Chicago Symphony Orchestra was playing at the Ravinia Festival. Lectures and other programs were held at Orchestra Hall in with speakers including Harry Houdini, Richard E. Byrd, Amelia Earhart, Bertrand Russell and Orson Welles.\n\nIn 2008 the venue hosted the 2008 Green National Convention alongside the Palmer House Hilton.\n\nIn 2012 the venue hosted the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates alongside the UIC Pavilion. This was held in Chicago simultaneous to the 2012 Chicago Summit.\n\nSub-optimal acoustics within Orchestra Hall have been an ongoing concern throughout its history, and have been adjusted in major overhauls of the main hall in both the 1960s and as part of the Symphony Center transformation between 1995 and 1997.\n\nCritical reaction is that the 1995-97 acoustical revamp was largely successful, though with room for further improvement, particularly in the upper registers. Reviews at the time noted \"...[the hall] sounded altogether new, with a depth and spaciousness never before heard here. ... The low strings, especially, had a new warmth and solidity, and the whole bass and baritonal range of the orchestra provided a firmer basis and a mellower foil for the sound above it, which has always been brash and brilliant. ... Not that everything is perfect. High frequencies can still sound glassy, and the high strings have not yet benefited as much as their brethren. [Supervising acoustician R. Lawrence Kirkegaard] had already begun to work on the problem after a private concert on Tuesday evening and continues to do so.\", \"The orchestra now has a mellow bass sound that simply didn't exist before. Bass drums, previously the source of loud, dry thwacks, have a new resonance and texture. Violins have a richer color.\", and \"It's fair to say that Orchestra Hall is, overall, vastly improved. The reverberation time, almost nonexistent before, is much lengthened. The strings, particularly in the lower ranges, are far more audible than was once the case, and all of the instruments resound with far more bloom, warmth, and brilliance. The sound is a good deal better in the other traditional trouble spot, the main floor beneath the balcony overhang, superb in the lower balcony and altogether glorious in the gallery.\".\n\nIn a review of a piano recital, not an orchestral concert, \"Chicago Tribune\" music critic John von Rhein wrote \"...everything registered with the impact of the old hall, only better. There was more warmth, more space, around the keyboard. Similar reports came from listeners in the gallery.\". However, the same critic also noted shortly after the renovation \"As of now, the low end has been dramatically enhanced, perhaps too much so. The lower strings and lower brass are going to have to modify their sound output to the new sensitivities of the acoustics. In many ways, then, Orchestra Hall is a work in progress. The coming weeks and months will require adjustments from players and audience members alike. Lawrence Kirkegaard ... said he and his associates were 'intensively involved' in minor adjustments last week and will continue to tinker with the sound sporadically throughout the season.\", and some years after the transformation, critics at the \"Chicago Tribune\" newspaper expressed dissatisfaction with the Orchestra Hall acoustics.\n\n\nNotes\n"}

The focus is on General George Washington aiding the mortally wounded Hessian Colonel Johann Gottlieb Rall. Nearly 900 Hessians were captured at the battle. It is one of Trumbull's series of historical paintings on the war, which also includes the \"Declaration of Independence\" and \"The Death of General Mercer at the Battle of Princeton, January 3, 1777\". The painting is on view at the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nThe artist intended to show the compassion of General George Washington in this painting, as he wrote in the catalogue for his exhibited works at Yale University in 1835:\n\nStarting in 1775, Trumbull himself served in the war, having been appointed second aide-de-camp to Washington. He later resigned from the army in 1777. The study for this painting was begun in London in November, 1786. In the study, Washington enters from the left to order that Rall, upheld by two officers, be cared for respectfully. Trumbull returned to New York on November 26, 1789, to continue work on the painting by making portraits of Washington. He continued making changes on the painting until its completion in 1828.\n\nIn the center of the painting, American General George Washington is focusing his attention on the needs of the mortally wounded Hessian Colonel Johann Gottlieb Rall. Rall is being helped by American Major William Stephens Smith, aide-de-camp to General John Sullivan. Washington orders Smith to \"call our best surgeons to his assistance, and let us save his life if possible.\" During the battle, Rall had been shot twice and needed to be carried into his headquarters, where he died that night. Behind Washington, on horseback, are his aides, Colonel Robert Hanson Harrison and Captain Tench Tilghman.\n\nTo the left and behind Rall, severely wounded American Lieutenant James Monroe is attended to by Dr. John Riker. He saved Monroe's life by quickly clamping the damaged artery to stop the heavy bleeding. On the far left, dressed in white, is American Colonel Josiah Parker. He had the honor to receive Rall's sword of surrender and he alone holds a sword in the painting. Next to him are Colonels Edward Wigglesworth and William Shepard.\n\nAmerican Major General Nathanael Greene is shown on the right on a light-colored horse, facing Washington. Behind Greene are American Generals John Sullivan, Henry Knox, Philemon Dickinson, John Glover, and George Weedon.

Washington was later presented one as a war trophy.\n\nA large scale version ( × ), finished in 1831, is owned by the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nTrumbull did not use the prelude to the capture, namely the crossing of the Delaware River, as a subject.

The poem consisted of seven irregular ballad stanzas of 49 lines. The poem was a satirical attack and criticism of the British government. Satan is depicted meeting with key members of the British government. The poem was modelled on and meant as a continuation of \"The Devil's Thoughts\" of 1799 by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey. The work is important in Shelley's development and evolution of writings that castigate and criticise the British government to achieve political and economic reform.\n\nThe poem was written in 1812 by Shelley to protest the actions of the British government and harsh economic conditions in the country at the time. The poem emerged after the food riots in Devon where Shelley lived at that time. Prices for grain were at their highest level in 1812, there were shortages of food, and prices were inflated. Shelley attacked \"a brainless King\" and the \"princely paunch\" and \"each brawny haunch\" of the Prince Regent. The members of both houses of Parliament and the Church were also castigated. Political leaders and the wealthy were also attacked. The British war in Spain was similarly criticised.\n\nThe devil, Beelzebub, awoke and dressed in his Sunday clothes. He puts on boots to hide his hooves and gloves to hide his claws. He wears a three-cornered hat, a \"bras chapeau\", to hide his horns. \n\nHe went to London where he discussed religion and scandals with a friend. He went to St. James’s Court and St. Paul’s Church. He was “an agriculturist” and took care of his farm and his live-stock.\n\nThe devil then sat next to a priest at prayestates that without the Devil, the priest would have no job.\n\nHe then observed “a brainless King” with his attendants.\n\nHe observes that political leaders thrive from war and conflict and human misery. He castigates British policy in Ireland and the British military engagement in Spain against France. He attacks Lord Castlereagh. He attacks the Prince as being fat and having a “maudlin brain”. He observes that the Devil, sometimes called Nature, supports “men of power” and privilege.\n\nHe next observed a lawyer kill a “viper” which climbed up the leg of the table. The Devil hums “a hellish song”, comparing himself to a “yeoman” who surveys his lands contemplating his profits and gains.\n\nHe noted how the wealthy plunder and impoverish the poor. He castigates Bishops and Lawyers for their greed and pomp.\n\nHe next encounters a statesman to whom he reveals himself. The hell-hounds Murder, Want, and Woe, flocked around them. He castigates the carnage in Spain.\n\nThe devil is joyful. Monarchs prosper in war and turmoil and depredation. \n\nReason, however, will ultimately prevail. Those with reason, “the sons of Reason”, understand that as reason prevails, the rule of tyrants will be short-lived and they will eventually be overthrown\n\n\n"}
{"id": "143885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=143885", "title": "The Ego and Its Own", "text": "The Ego and Its Own\n\nThe Ego and Its Own (; meaningfully translated as The Individual and his Property, literally as The Unique and His Property) is an 1844 work by German philosopher Max Stirner. It presents a radically nominalist and individualist critique of Christianity, nationalism, and traditional morality on one hand; and on the other, humanism, utilitarianism, liberalism, and much of the then-burgeoning socialist movement, advocating instead an amoral (although importantly not inherently immoral or antisocial) egoism. It is considered a major influence on the development of anarchism, existentialism, nihilism, and postmodernism.\n\nThe first part of the text begins by setting out a tripartite dialectical structure based on an individual's stages of life (Childhood, Youth and Adulthood). In the first \"realistic\" stage, children are restricted by external material forces. Upon reaching the stage of youth, they begin to learn how to overcome these restrictions by what Stirner calls the \"self-discovery of mind\". However, in the \"idealistic\" stage, a youth now becomes enslaved by internal forces such as conscience, reason and other 'spooks' or 'fixed ideas' of the mind (including religion, nationalism and other ideologies). The final stage, 'egoism' sees the now adult individual freed from all internal and external constraints, attaining individual autonomy.\n\nThroughout the book, Stirner applies this dialectial structure to human history (the Ancient and Modern worlds, and the Egoistic Future). Part one is a sustained critique of the first two periods of human history and especially of the failure of the Modern world to escape from religious modes of thinking. Stirner's analysis is opposed to the belief that modern individuals are progressively more free than their predecessors. Stirner sees moderns as being oppressed by ideological forces such as Christianity and the ideologies of the modern nation state.\n\nStirner's critique of modernity is centred on the Protestant Reformation. According to Stirner, Reformation theology extended religious domination over individuals by blurring the distinction between the sensual and the spiritual (thus allowing priests to marry for example). The Reformation also strengthened and intensified religious belief and made it more personal, creating an internal conflict between natural desires and religious conscience. Thus the Reformation only served to further enslave Europeans under spiritual ideology.\n\nStirner's critique of a progressive view of history is part of his attack on the philosophies of the left Hegelians, especially that of Ludwig Feuerbach. Stirner sees Feuerbach's philosophy as merely a continuation of religious ways of thinking. Feuerbach had argued that Christianity was mistaken in taking human qualities and projecting them into a transcendent God. But according to Stirner, Feuerbach's philosophy, while rejecting a God, left the Christian qualities intact. Feuerbach had taken a set of human qualities and reified them, making them the only prescriptive view of humanity. This became just another religion for Stirner, a \"change of masters\" over the individual. Stirner criticizes other left-Hegelians for setting a conception of essential human nature as a goal to be striven for outside of the individual themselves. So while liberals like Arnold Ruge found the essence of the human in citizenship, and social liberals like Moses Hess found it in labor, all of them made a similar error of ossifying an \"essence\" of the human and deifying it. For Stirner, 'human nature' cannot provide any prescriptions on how one ought to live. His goal is to free the individual from such notions of essential universal goals.\n\nPart two is centered on the possibility of freedom from current ideological ways of thinking through a robust philosophical egoism. Stirner's egoism is centered on what he calls \"Eigenheit\" ('Ownness' or autonomy). This 'Ownness' is a feature of a more advanced stage of human personal and historical development. It is the groundwork for our world-view. \n\nStirner's Egoism is not a descriptive psychological egoism, in fact he believes that non-egoism is the most common way of thinking. Stirner also does not advocate a narrow prescriptive ethical egoism of self-interest. Stirner rejects, for example, the actions of an avaricious individual whose only pursuit is material gain. For Stirner such a pursuit enslaves the individual to a single goal and this is incompatible with his idea of autonomy.\n\nStirner's conception of Ownness is then a type of self-mastery in which one's actions are unrestricted by any internal or external constraints—\"I am my own only when I am master of myself, instead of being mastered by...anything else\". To attain autonomy, the individual must free himself from all forces, such as ideologies, religions, ethics, other persons and even their own desires. For Stirner, \"Eigenheit\" is the only good, and is incompatible with any moral, political and familial obligations (\"the forming of a family binds a man\".) Stirner's influence in anarchist circles stems from his rejection of the legitimacy of the state. Stirner argues that \"own will and the state are powers in deadly hostility, between which no 'perpetual peace' is possible\". Every form of the state is rejected as a despotism over individual self ownership. Even a unanimously democratic decision does not bind Stirner's egoist, since this would freeze his \"will of yesterday\", making him a slave to his past desires and decisions. Stirner rejects promise keeping on similar grounds of not allowing past actions to constrain his autonomy. He states that the egoist must embrace the \"heroism of the lie\".\n\nAlong with his critique of ideologies and institutions, Stirner also provides an alternative form of social relationship, the \"union of egoists\" (\"verein von egoisten\"). These unions are temporary groupings of self-determined individuals which do not subordinate each individual to the good of the group. The only good in these unions is the self-interest of each individual. Stirner suggests that some human relationships like love might continue in this new egoistic future. However this new kind of love is one in which the egoist does not sacrifice his autonomy and thus he loves only as long as \"love makes me happy\".\n\nStirner does not shy away from the radical outcomes of his worldview. He explains the relationship between the egoist and his objects or other persons as one of 'ownership'. For Stirner this means that there are no restrictions, moral or otherwise, on how an egoist can relate to other things and persons. The egoist views others instrumentally, they are \"nothing but - my food, even as I am fed upon and turned to use by you\". The consequences of this view is that he does not see murder, incest and infanticide as always unjustified. Stirner admits that this view affords little comfort to others but he states that his audience's concern is of no importance to him.\nHe also asserted his own \"doctrine\" of self-interest to be neither a universal truth nor an established viewpoint, and likens his book to a ladder you throw away after climbing, a sort of self-therapy.\n\nStirner repeatedly quotes Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller and Bruno Bauer assuming that readers will be familiar with their works. He also paraphrases and makes word-plays and in-jokes on formulations found in Hegel's works as well as in the works of his contemporaries such as Ludwig Feuerbach. This can make the book more demanding for contemporary readers.\n\nInitially, \"The Unique And Its Property\" received much attention, though most reviews were negative critiques by left Hegelians such as Ludwig Feuerbach and Moses Hess, as well as by Carl Schmitt. Feuerbach's critique, \"The Essence of Christianity in Relation to The Unique And Its Property\" called the work 'ingenious' and 'intelligent' but also criticizes it as 'eccentric, one-sided and falsely defined.' Stirner responded to these critiques in an 1845 essay titled \"Stirner's Critics\".\n\n\"The Unique And Its Property\" also had a profound impact on Marx and Engels. In 1844 Engels sent a letter to Marx praising \"the noble Stirner\" and suggesting that his dialectical Egoism can serve as a point of departure for communism: It is certainly true that we must first make a cause our own, egoistic cause, before we can do anything to further it. . . . [W]e are communists out of egoism also, and it is out of egoism that we wish to be human beings, not mere individuals...\n\nHowever, Marx and Engels would later collaborate on a lengthy criticism of Stirner's book in \"The German Ideology\" (1845, published 1932). The critique is a polemical tirade filled with ad hominem attacks and insults against Stirner (Marx calls him a \"petty bourgeois individualist intellectual\").\n\nStirner also had a lasting influence in the tradition of Individualist Anarchism. American Individualist Benjamin R. Tucker, editor of the Journal \"Liberty\", adopted Stirner's Egoism in 1886 while rejecting conceptions of natural rights. This led to a bitter split in American Individualist Anarchism between Egoists such as James L. Walker, Sidney Parker, Dora Marsden and John Beverly Robinson and the proponents of natural rights anarchism such as that of Lysander Spooner. Other Individualist Anarchists influenced by Stirner include Lev Chernyi, Adolf Brand, Renzo Novatore, John Henry Mackay, Enrico Arrigoni, Miguel Giménez Igualada, and Émile Armand.\n\nRecently, Stirner has been an influential source for post-left anarchist thinkers such as Jason McQuinn, Bob Black and Hakim Bey.\n\n\"He who destroyes a good Booke, kills reason it selfe\", a 1955 exhibition by University of Kansas Library noted the following regarding the book's initial publication: \n\n\n\n"}

He was part of the Bombay Progressive Artists' Group and the first post-colonial generation of artists in India, like John Wilkins who also broke free from the nationalist Bengal school and embraced Modernism instead, with its post-impressionist colours, cubist forms and brusque, expressionistic styles.\n\nAmong his most noted later paintings were his triptych \"Celebration\", which when sold for Rs 15 million ($317,500) at a Christie's auction in 2002, was not only the highest sum for an Indian painting at an international auction, but also triggered the subsequent great Indian art boom; his other noted works were the 'Diagonal Series', \"Santiniketan triptych\" series, \"Kali\", \"Mahishasura\" (1996). He stayed and worked in Mumbai for much of his life, except for three spells at London, New York, and Santiniketan, each having a distinct impact upon his work. He received several awards during his career including the Padma Bhushan in 2007.\n\nTyeb Mehta was born on 26 July 1925 in Kapadvanj, a town of Kheda district, the Indian state of Gujarat. He was brought up in the Crawford Market neighbourhood of Mumbai, populated by Dawoodi Bohras. At 22 years, during the partition riots of 1947 in Mumbai, while staying at Lehri House, Mohammed Ali Road, he witnessed a man being stoned to death by a mob, this he not only expressed in a drawing but it was to have lasting impact on his work, leading to stark and often disturbing depiction of his subjects.\n\nFor a while initially, he worked as a film editor in a cinema laboratory at Famous Studios, in Tardeo, Mumbai. Later, he received his diploma from Sir J. J. School of Art in 1952, and was part of the Bombay Progressive Artists' Group, which drew stylistic inspiration from Western Modernism, and included greats of Indian paintings such as F.N. Souza, S.H. Raza and M.F. Husain.\n\nHe left for London in 1959, where he worked and lived till 1964. Thereafter, he visited the New York City, when he was awarded a fellowship from the John D. Rockefeller 3rd Fund in 1968. During the years the artist spent in London, Mehta's style was influenced by the expressionist works of Francis Bacon, but while in New York his work came to be characterised by minimalism. He made a three-minute film, \"Koodal\" (Tamil for 'meeting place'), which he shot at the Bandra slaughter house, it won the Filmfare Critics Award in 1970. He also remained an Artist-in-Residence at the Santiniketan between 1984–85, and returned to Mumbai with significant changes in his work. Common themes of his works were trussed bulls, the rickshaw puller, from here he moved to the \"Diagonal series\", which he created through the 1970s, after accidentally discovering it in 1969, when in a moment of creative frustration he flung a black streak across his canvas. Later in life, he added \"Falling Figures\" made in 1991, based on his experience of witnessing the violent death of a man in the street during the Partition of India riots of 1947, Besides adding several mythological figures into his work, highlighted by the depictions of goddess Kali and demon Mahishasura.\n\nTyeb Mehta held the then record for the highest price an Indian painting has ever sold for at auction ($317,500 USD or 15 million Indian rupees) for \"Celebration\" at Christie's in 2002. In May 2005, his painting \"Kali\" sold for 10 million Indian rupees (approximately equal to 230,000 US dollars) at Indian auction house Saffronart's online auction. A reinterpretation of the tale of demon Mahishasura by Mehta showing goddess Durga locked in an embrace with the demon sold for $1.584 million. In 2008 one of his paintings sold for $2 million.\n\nIn December 2005, Mehta's painting \"Gesture\" was sold for 31 million Indian rupees to Ranjit Malkani, chairman of Kuomi Travel, at the Osian's auction. That made it the highest price ever paid by an Indian for a work of Indian contemporary art at auction in India at the time.\n\nMehta's were the first works by a contemporary Indian artist to sell for over a million dollars, and indicated a burgeoning interest in Indian art by the international market; as a result, Mehta became a cultural hero.\n\nTyeb Mehta spent most of life in Mumbai and later in life stayed at Lokhandwala, Mumbai. He died on 2 July 2009 at a Mumbai hospital following a heart attack. He is survived by his wife, Sakina, their son, Yusuf, and daughter, Himani and a number of grandchildren.\n\nHe received a fellowship from the John D. Rockefeller 3rd Fund in 1968, also in the same year, a gold medal for paintings at the first Triennial in New Delhi, and in 1974 the Prix Nationale at the International Festival of Painting in Cagnes-sur-Mer, France, the Kalidas Samman, instituted by the Madhya Pradesh Government, in 1988, the Dayawati Modi Foundation Award for Art, Culture, and Education in 2005, and the Padma Bhushan in 2007. His film 'Koodal' was awarded the Filmfare Critics' Award in 1970.\n\nMehta's work has been exhibited in the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, England, and the Hirshhorn Museum. A career retrospective is scheduled for later 2009 at the National Gallery of Modern Art, in New Delhi.\n\n\n\n"}

Its boundaries are ill-defined, but most definitions include the area between 27th Street to the north, San Pablo Avenue to the west, City Center to the south, and Harrison St to the east. The neighborhood has become an important entertainment district in recent years.\n\nThe area near 20th Street and Broadway had been Oakland's main shopping district in the mid-20th century. Several buildings from that era remain, including the Capwell's department store, which later became Sears and is currently being developed into a mixed-use retail and office building called \"Uptown Station;\" the I. Magnin department store; the Paramount Theater; and the Fox Oakland Theatre. The Payless Drug Store and Market located at Telegraph Ave. and 20th St, housed the drug store small produce markets and seafood sellers. It included a SAAG's sausage counter and even a USO branch.\nThis structure was demolished in the early 1960s to construct a parking structure for Capwell's Department store. The area was home to one of the original Kwik Way hamburger outlets and also at Broadway and Grand Ave the Oakland branch of Breuners furniture.\n\nWest of Telegraph Avenue, the neighborhood was for many years largely made up of parking lots and garages. The area has gone through several failed urban renewal projects and proposals, including proposals for a shopping mall, an entertainment district, high-rise housing, and a professional baseball stadium. The area now contains several attractive high-rise apartment buildings.\n\nDuring Jerry Brown's time as Mayor (1999-2007) The Uptown District was deemed the Entertainment center of the city. Redevelopment has taken place by large upscale apartments and restaurants, bringing some much needed money and foot traffic into the area. The centerpiece has been the city government's 10K program, an effort to bring 10,000 additional residents to the downtown area. The largest of the new apartment complexes is a five-story, three-building apartment complex called \"The Uptown\" built by Forest City Enterprises, including a new dog-friendly park called Fox Square. A new surface street, Rashida Muhammad Street, was named after the late community activist who died of lung cancer in 2006. Alice Walker immortalized Rashida Muhammad's (aka Dessie X. Woods) story in her collection of essays \"Living by the Word\". The street was built with the stated goal of The Uptown project of enhancing and building a new community in the area. This complex also features the \"Remember Them\" sculpture by Mario Chiodo, a local artist. The sculpture, when it is complete, will be one of the largest bronze sculptures in the United States. The 25 humanitarians honored in this sculpture include Oskar Schindler, Maya Angelou, Ruby Bridges, Cesar Chavez, Thich Nhat Hanh, and Mother Teresa.\n\nNumerous bars and restaurants have opened between 16th Street and Grand Avenue. Retail continues to add to the landscape of the Uptown District.\n\nIn addition to becoming a nightlife destination for East Bay residents, the area has developed well culturally overall. The area now includes many cafes, bakeries, and galleries, as well as being a central hub for the other bars and restaurants located in the surrounding neighborhoods.\n\nA large Sears department store was located in the center of the Uptown district, between Telegraph Avenue, 20th Street, and Broadway. The store closed in 2014. The building was bought by Uber and is being branded as \"Uptown Station\".\n\nWhat is commonly called \"First Friday\" or \"Art Murmur\" has given way to a vibrant art scene in Oakland which mainly centers around the Uptown District. Some of the first galleries to open in this area included 21 Grand, the defunct Mama Buzz Cafe (now the Telegraph Beer Garden), and Rock Paper Scissors (art collective and store.) More recent notable galleries include Krowswork, Mercury 20 Gallery, Johansson Projects and Creative Growth. In September 2011 Project Bandaloop performed the premier of an aerial dance piece called Bound(less) on The Great Wall of Oakland, and in May 2013 the first annual Oakland Internet Cat Video Festival took place on the Great Wall.\n\nTwo Mile Wines has produced wines in the Uptown district since 2009, pushing urban winemaking into the heart of Oakland and First Friday. More recently, Oakland Spirits Company has started producing gins, brandies, and other spirits in the neighborhood, demonstrating that a mix of art, manufacturing, and trades can thrive amidst rapid gentrification.\n\nUptown is in the so-called Oaksterdam district of medical marijuana clubs which have contributed to a resurgence in retail and pedestrian activity in the area.\n\nUptown is also the home to the Oakland Ice Center, which houses youth and adult amateur hockey leagues, figure skating lessons, and public skating sessions.\n\nThe tallest building in the Uptown district is the Gothic Revival Cathedral Building.\n\nUptown includes a number of classic Art Deco buildings, although some are now in disrepair. These include:\nThe space above Newberrys housed Sweets Ballroom venue which hosted many\nbig bands and jazz greats from the '30s through the '60s. Some of the performers were Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Ella Fitzgerald, Jimmie Lunceford and many \nothers. The ballroom was locally owned by the Sweet family for the whole period.\n\nThe 19th Street/Oakland BART station is in Uptown, in a subway under Broadway. Oakland's Art Moderne Greyhound bus depot is on the other side of the neighborhood, on San Pablo Avenue at Interstate 980. AC Transit operates the Uptown Transit Center and numerous local buses, including a free weekday shuttle called \"The B\" that connects the Uptown district with Old Oakland, Chinatown, City Center, Lake Merritt, and Jack London Square.\n\n\n"}
