She wrote a number of screenplays for silent movies but is best remembered for her groundbreaking exploits as \"The World's Greatest Girl Reporter\" during the 1920s and 1930s and her celebrity interviews for \"Photoplay\" magazine.\n\nSt. Johns was born in Los Angeles, the only daughter of Los Angeles criminal lawyer Earl Rogers (who was a friend of publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst) and his wife, Harriet Belle Greene. She attended Hollywood High School, graduating in 1910.\n\nShe obtained her first job in 1912 working as a reporter for Hearst's \"San Francisco Examiner\". She reported on crime, politics, society, and sports news before transferring to the \"Los Angeles Herald\" in 1913.\n\nAfter seeing her work for that newspaper, James R. Quirk offered her a job writing for his new fan magazine \"Photoplay\". St. Johns accepted the job so she could spend more time with her husband and children. Her celebrity interviews helped the magazine become a success through her numerous revealing interviews with Hollywood film stars. She also wrote short stories for \"Cosmopolitan\", \"The Saturday Evening Post\", and other magazines and finished nine of her thirteen screenplays before returning to reporting for Hearst newspapers.\n\nWriting in a distinctive, emotional style, St. Johns reported on, among other subjects, the controversial Jack Dempsey–Gene Tunney \"long-count\" fight in 1927, the treatment of the poor during the Great Depression, and the 1935 trial of Bruno Richard Hauptmann for kidnapping and murdering the son of Charles Lindbergh.\n\nIn the mid-1930s, she moved to Washington, D.C., to report on national politics for the \"Washington Herald\". There she became prominent among a group of female reporters working for Cissy Patterson. Her coverage of the assassination of Senator Huey Long in 1935, the abdication of King Edward VIII in 1936, the Democratic National Convention of 1940, and other major stories made her one of the best-known reporters of the day. St. Johns again left newspaper work in 1948 in order to write books, and to teach journalism at UCLA.\n\nIn 1962, she published \"Final Verdict\", a biography of her father Earl Rogers. The book was adapted for a TNT television film of the same name in 1991; Olivia Burnette portrayed the young St. Johns.\n\nSt. Johns was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom on April 22, 1970.\n\nDuring the late 1960s and 1970s, St. Johns was a frequent guest on various talk shows including Jack Paar's \"The Tonight Show\" and The Merv Griffin Show. During one \"Tonight Show\" visit, Paar noted that St. Johns had known many of the legends of Hollywood's Golden Age and was once rumored to have had Clark Gable's child.\n\nSt. Johns replied, \"Well who wouldn't have wanted to have Clark Gable's baby?\" Paar noted that St. Johns had enjoyed a rather incredible life and asked if there was anything she wanted to do that she had not yet done. St. Johns replied, \"I just want to live long enough to see how it all turns out.\"\n\nIn 1976, at the age of 82, she returned to reporting for the \"Examiner\" to cover the bank robbery and conspiracy trial of Patty Hearst, granddaughter of her former employer. In the late 1970s, St. Johns hosted a miniseries chronicling Gable's films, which appeared on Iowa Public Television. Around the same time she was interviewed for the television documentary series \"Hollywood: A Celebration of the American Silent Film\" (1980).\n\nThe following year, St. Johns appeared with other early 20th-century figures as one of the 'witnesses' in Warren Beatty's \"Reds\" (1981). St. Johns spent her remaining years living in Arroyo Grande, California.\n\nSt. Johns was married three times and had four children. Her first marriage was to \"Los Angeles Herald\" chief copy editor William Ivan St. Johns, whom she married in 1914. They had two children, Elaine and William Ivan, Jr. before divorcing in 1927. The following year, she married one-time Stanford University football star Richard Hyland. They had one son, Richard, and divorced in 1934. St. Johns' third marriage was to F. Patrick O'Toole, an airline executive. They married in 1936 and divorced in October 1942. After her third divorce, St. Johns adopted a son as a single parent.\n\nOn August 10, 1988, St. Johns died at the South County Convalescent Hospital in Arroyo Grande, California at the age of 94. She is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8825215", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8825215", "title": "Amato Opera", "text": "Amato Opera\n\nThe Amato Opera was an opera company located in the East Village neighborhood of the Manhattan borough of New York City. The company was produced by the husband and wife team of Anthony and Sally Amato and presented opera on a small scale with a reduced orchestra at low prices. Over its 61 years in existence, it encouraged and trained many young singers.\n\nThe company was founded in 1948 by husband and wife team Anthony (July 21, 1920 – December 13, 2011) and Sally Bell Amato (September 27, 1917 – August 16, 2000). Tony Amato acted as artistic director, choosing the repertoire, rehearsing and conducting the operas. In the early productions, he often cast students from his opera classes at The America Theatre Wing, where he was the Director of the Opera Workshop. There was no admission charge for the company's early performances, because union rules prohibited it. Instead, during the intermission the Amatos would \"pass the hat around\" for contributions. Sally acted as costumier, ran lights and box office and managed publicity and business matters. Under the alias Serafina Bellantoni, she sang in productions for over fifty years.\n\nTheir first production, Rossini's \"The Barber of Seville\", was mounted in the auditorium of Our Lady of Pompeii Church at Bleecker and Carmine Streets. The following week, the company produced \"Cavalleria rusticana\" and \"Pagliacci\". The company used many other locations in its early years, including the Kaufman Auditorium of the 92nd Street Y, the Fashion Institute of Technology, and Washington Irving High School auditorium.\n\nIn 1951, the company moved into its first permanent home at 159 Bleecker Street. In its new 299-seat theatre, the company gave four performances during nearly every weekend of the year. The company's repertory soon spanned 21 different operas, and it gave over 1,296 performances at the theatre. Productions were occasionally presented in nearby cities, such as New London and New Haven, Connecticut, and abridged children's performances were also given at The Town Hall. The Bleecker Street theatre closed in 1959, but the company continued to perform at other venues, including The Town Hall and 126 West 23rd Street.\n\nAmato found a new permanent home in 1964 in a four-story building, next to a gas station and near the famous rock club CBGB, at 319 Bowery near Second Street, a former Mission House and restaurant supply store, which was converted into a theatre with rehearsal and storage space, 107-seats, a 20-foot stage and a tiny orchestra pit.\n\nEach season included five or six different operas, typically a mix of comedies and tragedies, and the repertory eventually expanded to over 60 operas. Each opera ran over five weekends, and the company used multiple rotating casts. Amato also mounted Saturday morning Opera-In-Brief performances. Aimed at children, the Opera-In-Brief performances are full-length short operas or abridged versions of longer operas interspersed with narration. Throughout its life, Amato Opera maintained a policy of keeping prices low, charging only $1.80 a seat in 1964. By 1975 ticket prices were $3–4 and in 1998, they were $23. In 2008, tickets were $35 ($30 for students, children, and seniors), still modest compared to those at larger opera houses. PBS made a documentary film about Amato in 2001 called \"Amato: A Love Affair With Opera\". PBS wrote, \"The Amato Opera has grown famous as a testing ground for young singers; many of its performers have gone on to sing, direct, and conduct in opera companies around the world ... The orchestra is phenomenal. The sets, designed by Richard Cerullo for the past twenty years, are wonderfully designed to make the most of the Amato's small stage. And what the theater lacks in seating capacity it makes up for in intimacy.\"\n\nAmato Opera received commendations and awards from Mayors Abe Beame, Ed Koch and Rudy Giuliani, and the Amatos were inducted into City Lore's Peoples' Hall of Fame, honored by the American Cultural Roundtable, and the Italian Heritage and Cultural Committee, in recognition for their contribution to the artistic life of New York City.\n\nAmato Opera closed after its last performance of \"The Marriage of Figaro\" on May 31, 2009. Anthony Amato announced the planned closure on January 10, 2009, before a performance of \"The Merry Widow\". He told \"The New York Times\", \"Now, with Sally gone, I have decided that it is time for me to start a new chapter in my life\".\n\nFollowing the closure of the Amato Opera, some of the former performers and members of the Amato board of directors formed Amore Opera. Tony Amato gave all the sets and costumes of Amato Opera to this new company. Amore Opera has continued to present opera seasons since then. Another successor company, Bleecker Street Opera, performed from 2010 through 2011. In January 2013, another former Amato performer formed Opera Theatre of Montclair in New Jersey. Opera Theatre of Montclair continues to produce mainstage opera and opera outreach throughout Northern New Jersey.\n\nIn 2010, Amato published a book about the company called \"The Smallest Grand Opera in the World\". Amato died on December 13, 2011.\n\n"}

He also describes the \"retro-futurist\" cities in the series as being in between those extremes and places of \"great beauty but dubious moral character.\" He attributes the ambivalence towards urbanity to series creator George Lucas' own feelings about cities and urban environments.\nThe settings of the movie have generally been praised, but one author took exception to the \"anachronistic period architecture and statuary\" of \"\", saying it improperly associated third world buildings with conceptions of innocence and the primitive in a way that was discriminatory and demeaning.\n\nLuke Skywalker is first seen in \"\" living with his adoptive parents in a \"complex of caves and domed structures\" on Tatooine, filmed in the Tunisian desert town of Matmata. The end of the first movie was shot in the Guatemalan rain forest where a celebration with rebel allies takes place in a caved area (a scene said to be borrowed from Leni Riefenstahl's 1935 Nazi propaganda film \"Triumph of the Will\"). The exotic locales provide scenery that is unfamiliar to \"all but a few experts in non-western architecture\", providing the films with fantastic settings that could still be believable.\n\nThree architecture and planning students noted that the \"latest\" (1999) \"Star Wars\" movie \"(The Phantom Menace)\" offered \"a variety of urban development options\" in a \"San Diego Union-Tribune\" story headlined \"How would you like to live on a Star Wars' world?\" The article included illustrations of Coruscant (\"completely covered by development\" and \"surrounded by mile-high skyscrapers\"), including views from the Jedi Council building, and the city of \"Theed\" (inspired by an 18th-century palace near Naples, Italy). On Coruscant, \"development extends miles below the surface of the city and up into the clouds.\"\n\nThe \"urban future\" has also been depicted in \"Blade Runner\" where \"the setting is a grimy, crime-ridden Los Angeles in the 21st century\". The architecture of \"Star Wars\" may also have been influenced by Stanley Kubrick's \"\". The designs continued Lucas' work from his first feature film, \"THX 1138\", which featured a claustrophobic, Orwellian \"subteranean world of black-and-white spaces\" where the population is subdued with drugs and kept under constant surveillance.\n\n\"Architects' Journal\" rated the Jedi Temple (located in the capital planet of \"Coruscant\") third on its top-ten architecture of \"Star Wars\" list behind the second Death Star and Jabba the Hutt’s palace on Tatooine, and ahead of Coruscant, capital city of the Old Republic. The temple is described in the article as adapting \"the robust typology of Mayan temples, with durasteel cladding specified for the external stone walls for improved defensive strength\" and said to be a ziggurat that \"is built above a Force-nexus and has ample room for training facilities, accommodation and the Jedi Archive.\" The temple has five towers, the tallest is Tranquillity Spire, that are stylistically similar to the minarets surrounding the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. \"Star Wars Insider\" listed it as the one hundredth greatest thing about \"Star Wars\" in its one hundredth issue special.\n\nThe battle cruisers featured in \"Star Wars\" have been described as examples of \"Suprematist architecture\".\n\nThe San Francisco Federal Building designed by Thom Mayne has been compared to the Jawa Sandcrawler featured in \"\". The ING headquarters building (in Amsterdam, Netherlands) has been described as looking like something out of \"Star Wars\" that could \"move forward on its legs\".\nConversely, the Trinity College, Dublin, Long Room Library is thought to be the basis for the Jedi Academy Library in \"\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1058980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1058980", "title": "Braun (company)", "text": "Braun (company)\n\nBraun GmbH ( \"brown\"; ), formerly Braun AG, is a German consumer products company based in Kronberg. From 1984 until 2007, Braun was a wholly owned subsidiary of The Gillette Company, which had purchased a controlling interest in the company in 1967. Braun is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Procter & Gamble, which acquired Gillette in 2005. On 16 April 2012, De'Longhi bought perpetual rights to manufacture Braun branded products from Procter & Gamble in the small appliance segment. Procter & Gamble will continue to own the Braun brand.\n\nMax Braun, a mechanical engineer, established a small engineering shop in Frankfurt am Main in 1921. In 1923, he began producing components for radio sets. In 1928, the company had grown to such an extent, partly due to the use of certain plastic materials, that it moved to new premises on \"Idsteiner Strasse\".\n\nIn 1929, eight years after he started his shop, Max Braun began to manufacture entire radio sets. Soon after, Braun became one of Germany's leading radio manufacturers. This development continued with the launch of one of the first combined radio and record players in 1932.\n\nIn 1935, the Braun brand was introduced, and the original incarnation of the logotype with the raised \"A\" was born. At the 1937 World's Fair in Paris, Max Braun received the award \"For special achievements in phonography\". During World War II, Braun was compelled to more or less abandon products for the civilian sector. In 1944, the Frankfurt factories were almost entirely destroyed and Max Braun began to rebuild his company with 150 employees.\n\nAfter the war, Braun continued to produce state-of-the art radios and audio equipment, and soon became well known for its \"high-fidelity\" audio and record players, including the famous SK line. In 1954, the company also began producing film slide projectors, a mainstay of its business for the next forty years. By 1956, Braun was marketing the first fully automatic tray film slide projector, the PA 1. Braun AG slide projectors all utilized a linear or straight tray as opposed to a round-tray design, which allowed the projector to remain small and compact.\n\nThe 1950s also marked the beginning of the product that Braun is most known for today: the electric shaver. The S 50 was the first electric shaver from Braun. The shaver was designed in 1938, but World War II delayed its introduction until 1951. It featured an oscillating cutter block with a very thin, yet very stable steel-foil mounted above it. This principle is still used in Braun's shavers of today. \n\nThe 1950s also saw the start of kitchen appliances, like the mixer MX 3 and the kitchen machine (Küchenmaschine or kitchen machine) Braun KM 3. The KM 3 is a family of food processors which started with the model KM 3/31 in 1957. Designed by Gerd Alfred Müller, these machines were built in nearly unchanged form for 36 years, until 1993. \n\nIn 1962, Braun became Braun AG, a publicly traded company. In 1963, the company started distributing microphones by U.S. manufacturer Shure in Germany. Also during the 1960s, Braun created the Rams-designed T3 pocket radio. By this time, Braun's film slide projectors were featuring high-quality optics and all-metal construction combined with sleek functionalist styling, and competed with higher-end Eastman Kodak and Leitz products in the global market. Braun also started distributing in Germany high-end medium-format SLR system-cameras produced by Japanese camera manufacturer Zenza Bronica, as well as Braun-Nizo brand cameras and Super 8 film cameras (formerly of Niezoldi & Krämer GmbH; purchased by Braun in 1962). In 1967, a majority share of the company was acquired by the Boston, Massachusetts-based conglomerate Gillette Group.\n\nErwin Braun, one of Max Braun's sons, took on the sales agency of the LECTRON system product line in 1967. He was very interested in making the teaching of electronics approachable to students all over the world. The LECTRON system was a simple but ingenious product which fit the bill perfectly. The LECTRON System was introduced to the German marketplace in 1966 by Egger-Bahn (a company primarily focused on the 9mm toy train sector). An electronic component such as a resistor was placed inside a transparent flat cube with a white cover on the top of which had the electronic symbol and its value. The blocks containing different components and types of connections could be put together to form a working circuit with the schematic diagram of the circuit illustrated by the symbols on the top of the block. The blocks were held together with the use of magnets behind the conductive plates on the sides and bottom of the block. In 1972, due to pressure from Gillette, the LECTRON assets were sold off to Manfred Walter, the manager of the LECTRON product line at Braun. Mr. Walter formed Lectron, GmbH in 1972 to continue selling and developing the LECTRON product line. Mr. Walter retired and gifted the LECTRON assets to the Reha-Werkstatt Oberrad in 2001. The RWO continues to manufacture and sell the LECTRON system to this day.\n\nBy the 1970s, Braun had begun to focus on home consumer appliances, including shavers, coffee makers, razors, clocks, and radios. The company's line of film slide projectors and hi-fi products was discontinued. In 1998, Braun AG was transformed into a privately held company.\n\nIn 1981, the company's audio and hi-fidelity division, which grew out of Braun's former core business of radios, turntables, and hi-fidelity audio products, was spun off into Braun Electronic GmbH, a legally independent Gillette subsidiary. Braun Electronic GmbH put out its last audio-fi set in 1990 before the business was discontinued. Also in the early 1980s, Braun sold its photographic and slide projector division to Robert Bosch GmbH.\n\nIn 1982, Gillette Group moved to integrate Braun with the parent company by taking full control over its operations. In 1984, Braun ceased the production of cigarette lighters. That same year, Braun became a wholly owned subsidiary of Gillette.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, Braun held a leading position among the world's home appliance manufacturers, but profitability concerns began to surface. Many of Braun's competitors closely imitated Braun designs and had them produced in low-cost labor countries at lower costs. The litigation commenced by the company to reverse the sales losses and damage to its product image cost Braun substantial amounts of money.\n\nIn 1998, Gillette decided to transform Braun AG into a private company before it bought back a 19.9 percent share in its subsidiary The Gillette Company Inc., which Braun had acquired in 1988. The following year, Braun's sales organization was merged with those of Gillette's other business divisions to cut costs. At the end of the 1990s, Braun and Gillette suffered losses in several areas. Looking for ways to return to profitability, Gillette considering the disposal of some of Braun's less profitable divisions, such as kitchen appliances and thermometers, but abandoned the idea a few months later when no buyers were found. Braun's sales in those areas began to recover in 2000.\n\nGillette was acquired by Procter & Gamble (\"P&G\") in 2005, making Braun a wholly owned subsidiary of P&G. In early 2008, P&G discontinued sales of Braun appliances, except shavers and electric toothbrushes, in the North American market. In Europe, however, Braun kept selling all its core categories until 2012, when the Braun brand relating to kitchen appliances was purchased by De'Longhi.\n\nBraun's products include the following categories:\n\n\nThe company was formerly a manufacturer of food processors, radios, slide projectors, Super 8 film cameras and accessories, and high-fidelity sound systems.\n\nToday, Braun focuses on its core categories (shaving and grooming, beauty and hair care). Household Small Appliances, Health and wellness category as well as clocks and watches are now run by other companies (De'Longhi, Zeon, Kaz) under licence.\n\nFrom the mid-1950s, the Braun brand was closely linked with the concept of German modern industrial design and its combination of functionality and technology. In 1956, Braun created its first design department, headed by Dr. Fritz Eichler, who instituted a collaboration with the Ulm School of Design to develop a new product line. In 1956 the company introduced its famous \"SK4\" record player (\"Snow White's Coffin\"), designed by a youthful Dieter Rams together with the pioneer of system design, Hans Gugelot, then lecturer of design at the Ulm School of Design. Rams soon became the most influential designer at Braun. Rams was a key figure in the German design renaissance of the late 1950s and 1960s. Eventually becoming head of Braun's design staff, Rams' influence was soon evidenced in many products. Braun's famous SK 4 record player and the high-quality \"D\"-series (D25–D47) of 35mm slide projectors are some of the better examples of Functionalist design.\n\nAnother 'icon' of modern design, but less well known, is the electrostatic loudspeaker unit BRAUN LE1, the electronics were licensed from QUAD. Dieter Rams and Dietrich Lubs are also responsible for the classic range of Braun alarm clocks, collaborating first on the AB 20 in 1987. These designs were discontinued by Braun in 2005. For nearly 30 years Dieter Rams served as head of design for Braun A.G. until his retirement in 1995 when he was succeeded by Peter Schneider. Many of his designs—sleek coffee makers, calculators, radios and razors—have found a permanent home at the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nIn the 1970s, a design approach influenced by pop-art began to inspire Braun products, which by this time included many common household appliances and products. Contemporary Braun design of the period incorporated this new approach in bright colors and a lightness of touch, while still clean-lined in keeping with Functionalist philosophy.\n\n"}

Primarily a style of ornament, it is known as \"bruskbarokk\" in Norwegian, \"bruskbarok\" in Danish and \"Knorpelbarock\" in German (all these use the local words for cartilage), and \"style cartilage\" may be encountered in French. However, the various terms can be applied to a bewildering range of styles of Northern Mannerist and Baroque ornament. In English these terms are mainly found in translated texts from European languages. \n\nThere is much use of strapwork in which, instead of leather or paper forms being imitated, the shapes may give the impression of imitating flayed skin or cartilage, including the cartilage giving the ear its shape, whether or not this was actually the intention, hence the origin of the name. The style has some relation to the auricular style of the same period, which is seen in its purest and most famous form in Dutch silverwork. This does take its name from resembling somewhat the shape of the ear, as does the German term \"Ohrmuschelstil\".\n\nDealing mainly with interior architecture, it marked the transition from High-Renaissance and Manierism to established Baroque, placing it during the years 1620-1660. Cartilage baroque draws heavily on established Renaissance art forms, but gets its distinctive style from added ornamental elements, such as leaves and garlands, and a suppressed curvature. \n\nThe Scottish craftsman, woodcutter and painter Andrew Lawrenceson Smith is seen as one of the leading examples in the use of cartilage baroque, especially for his work in Stavanger Cathedral.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1327621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1327621", "title": "Christmas village", "text": "Christmas village\n\nA Christmas village (or putz) is a decorative, miniature-scale village often set up during the Christmas season. These villages are rooted in the elaborate Christmas traditions of the Moravian church, a Protestant denomination. Mass-produced cardboard Christmas villages became popular in the United States during the early and mid-20th century, while porcelain versions became popular in the later part of the century.\n\nThe tradition of decorative Christmas villages is rooted in the holiday traditions of the Moravian church, a Protestant denomination with early settlements in Salem, North Carolina and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. In American Moravian homes, the construction of a nativity scene, or putz, at the base of a Christmas tree was a very common holiday activity. The term was derived from the German verb \"putzen\", which means \"to clean\" or \"to decorate.\" These nativity scenes soon became very elaborate, and often included sawdust or fine dirt spread to represent roads leading to the manger; stones and fresh moss to represent grottos or caves; and sticks and branches to represent miniature trees. These details were in addition to the carved wooden figures that represented the Holy Family, animals, shepherds, and other traditional nativity figures. \n\nAlthough initially placed beneath the Christmas tree, by the early 19th century a family's \"putz\" might have also been found on the fireplace mantel, side tables, and other prominent places within the home. These expanded scenes might include other stories from the Bible. The story of Noah's Ark, an especially popular subject for a putz, could result in the arranging of several hundred carved animals wending their way towards the ark.\n\nBy the mid-19th century, more secular figures and scene elements were being added to the putz. In many homes, the putz took more time and energy than the decoration of the family Christmas tree. Separate areas were developed with different themes; spreading outward from the Nativity scene were other farms or village scenes, which had a way of growing larger and more elaborate every year. Eventually, toy trains were added to these miniature worlds.\n\nAfter World War II, several Japanese companies started mass-producing cardboard or paper houses, churches, and other buildings. These small buildings usually had holes in the back or the bottom through which Christmas lights were placed to provide illumination. The buildings had tiny colored cellophane windows and were decorated with mica-dusted roofs to give the appearance of snow. Since these buildings were made of inexpensive material and were widely available throughout the United States, they became a very popular Christmas decoration.\n\nIn the 1970s, ceramic or porcelain Christmas villages were introduced and started to gain popularity. Department 56 was one of the first companies to make these buildings and remain amongst the most well-known. Other companies, such as Lemax, have also produced similar villages, and there are numerous other brands sold. In Europe, Luville and Dickensville are established brands. Drugstores and dollar stores now often carry much smaller buildings, which are typically not as well-painted. Unpainted buildings are also sometimes available at craft stores.\n\nChristmas village buildings are not usually made to consistent relative scale. A church building might well be ten times the height of an ordinary house in reality but this would make very cumbersome models and look odd within a Christmas village display. It is only necessary for the church building to be noticeably taller than the house, to give it an imposing stature.\n\nLike many other Christmas traditions, the notion of a village to celebrate a holiday has spread to other holidays, with a few companies making Halloween and Easter villages.\n\n"}

Illuminating a subject with light sources of different colour temperatures will usually cause colour cast problems in the shadows. In general, the human eye does not notice the unnatural colour, because our eyes and brains adjust and compensate for different types of light in ways that cameras cannot.\n\nIn film, colour casts can also be caused by problems in development. Improper timing or imbalanced chemical mixtures can cause unwanted casts.\n\nColour casts can also occur in old photographs due to fading of dyes, particularly under the action of ultra violet light. These may be correctable on a scanned version of the photograph with image editing techniques.\n\nMost digital cameras try to automatically detect and compensate colour cast and usually have a selection of manually set white balance settings to choose from. Otherwise, photo editing programs, such as Photoshop, often have built in colour correction facilities. For film, blue filters and amber filters are used to counter casts. Amber filters are used to reduce the blueish tint caused by daylight. Blue filters reduce the orange colour caused by incandescent light.\n\nA variety of coloured filters in varying degrees of intensity are available. Kodak's amber filters, for example, vary from palest yellow (\"81C\") to deepest amber (\"85B\"). A photographer chooses which filter to use based on the quality of the ambient light. Colour temperature meters can read the temperature of the existing lighting conditions and guide the selection of the filter. Clouded sky, for example, requires a paler amber than clear blue sky. If a filter is unavailable, flash is an alternative solution which usually provides enough neutral white light to counter the cast.\n\nIn the case of film, if photographs all contain the same cast, it is usually indicative of improper chemical development. If the film itself does not contain any cast, it can be reused to create another set of photographs in proper chemical conditions. If the film contains a cast, filters can be used during photo processing to correct it.\n\n"}

This sort of metal casting has been used in India for over 4,000 years and is still used. One of the earliest known lost wax artefacts is the dancing girl of Mohenjo-daro. The product of dhokra artisans are in great demand in domestic and foreign markets because of primitive simplicity, enchanting folk motifs and forceful form. Dhokra horses, elephants, peacocks, owls, religious images, measuring bowls, and lamp caskets etc., are highly appreciated. The lost wax technique for casting of copper based alloys has also been found in China, Egypt, Malaysia, Nigeria, Central America, and other places.\n\nThere are two main processes of lost wax casting: solid casting and hollow casting. While the former is predominant in the south of India the latter is more common in Central and Eastern India. Solid casting does not use a clay core but instead a solid piece of wax to create the mould; hollow casting is the more traditional method and uses the clay core.\n\nThe first task in the lost wax hollow casting process consists of developing a clay core which is roughly the shape of the final cast image. Next, the clay core is covered by a layer of wax composed of pure beeswax, resin from the tree \"Damara orientalis\", and nut oil. The wax is then shaped and carved in all its finer details of design and decorations. It is then covered with layers of clay, which takes the negative form of the wax on the inside, thus becoming a mould for the metal that will be poured inside it. Drain ducts are left for the wax, which melts away when the clay is cooked. The wax is then replaced by the molten metal, often using brass scrap as basic raw material. The liquid metal poured in hardens between the core and the inner surface of the mould. The metal fills the mould and takes the same shape as the wax. The outer layer of clay is then chipped off and the metal icon is polished and finished as desired.\n\nDhokra Damar tribes are the traditional metalsmiths of West Bengal and Odisha. Their technique of lost wax casting is named after their tribe, hence Dhokra metal casting. The tribe extends from Jharkhand to West Bengal and Orissa; members are distant cousins of the Chhattisgarh Dhokras. A few hundred years ago, the Dhokras of Central and Eastern India traveled south as far as Kerala and north as far as Rajasthan and hence are now found all over India. Dhokra, or Dokra, craft from around Santiniketan, West Bengal, is popular. Recently Adilabad Dokra from Telangana got Geographical Indicator tag in 2018.\n\nWhen mixed in the right proportion, this art form gives an antique look and augments well with various contemporary styles. A little different from its distant cousins of the east, it embodies a more primitive simplicity.\n\nSome are crafted by Bhottada section of the famous Gond tribes of Orissa, well known for their costumes and embellishment styles. Originally, seeds of different wild fruits in the forest were used as beads with cotton thread in their necklace and earrings which over the years have been substituted by beads made from brass by the heating and beating process. By and large, Bhottada women of affluent families having a special status in their community used this jewellery. In recent times, it symbolises a more utilitarian approach in a traditional framework.\n\n"}

{"id": "379611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=379611", "title": "Gruppo Bertone", "text": "Gruppo Bertone\n\nGruppo Bertone, commonly known simply as Bertone, was an Italian automobile company, which specialized in car styling, coachbuilding and manufacturing. Bertone styling is distinctive, with most cars having a strong \"family resemblance\" even if they are badged by different manufacturers. Bertone has styled cars for Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Aston Martin, Citroën, Ferrari, FIAT, Iso, Lancia, Lamborghini, Mercedes Benz, Opel and Volvo, among others. In addition, the Bertone studio was responsible for two of the later designs of the Lambretta motorscooter. In the late 1980s, Bertone styled the K20 motorcycle helmet for Swiss bicycle and motorcycle helmet manufacturer Kiwi.\n\nThe company was based in Grugliasco in northern Italy. Gruppo Bertone was founded as \"Carrozzeria Bertone\" in 1912 by Giovanni Bertone. Designer Nuccio Bertone took charge of the company after World War II and the company was divided into two units: \"Carrozzeria\" for manufacturing and \"Stile Bertone\" for styling. Until its bankruptcy in 2014, the company was headed by the widow of Nuccio Bertone, Lilli Bertone.\n\nAfter its bankruptcy, the Bertone name was retained by some of its former employees who continued as a Milan-based design company, Bertone Design.\n\nGiovanni Bertone started a carriage manufacturing business in Turin, at the age of 28. Along with three workers, he built horse-drawn vehicles.\n\nIn the first decades of the 20th century, cars were not common. The road traffic was dominated by horse-drawn carriages and the coaches built by the young Bertone were particularly regarded for their accuracy, quality and solidity. In 1914, Giuseppe Bertone, nicknamed \"Nuccio\", the second son of Giovanni Bertone, was born. This nickname later became known as the signature to Nuccio, one of the greatest Italian style masters in the world. The outbreak of the first world war triggered a major crisis of the young Italian industrial sector and heavily affected Giovanni Bertone, who was forced to close his company.\n\nAt the end of the First World War, Bertone's business restarted and expanded its activities, and began focusing on the automotive sector. In 1920, a new plant was opened near the Monginevro 119 in Turin.\nTwenty people were on the payroll. One year later, the first important contract was signed to the company. This was a torpedo styled body based on the SPA 23S chassis. Then, the FIAT \"501 Sport Siluro Corsa,\" the first of a family of models that would characterize the brand in the years to come, was designed. With that, the high performance sport car was born.\n\nDuring the 1920s, Turin was represented as one of the worldwide centers of excellence of the car industry. Bertone was sitting on the hub of it and formed partnerships with almost all the manufacturers of the day. Giovanni Bertone began doing bodywork on the Fast, Chiribiri, Aurea, SCAT and Diatto chassis. The most important and long lasting relationships were those with the two biggest Turin manufacturers: FIAT and Lancia.\n\nVincenzo Lancia realised straight away that Giovanni Bertone was an outstanding skilled craftsman with a great future ahead of him. Affectionately nicknaming him \"Bertunot\", he commissioned Bertone to create complete car bodies, above all for the limited series that the companies of the day were not always equipped to manufacture. This was Bertone's first opportunity to carry out limited production of special cars on standard mechanical bases, and was the beginning of a great industrial experience.\n\nThese are very exciting years for Bertone himself, and also for the evolution of industrial style and design. The car body shapes are slowly but continuously changing, angular shapes begin to fade, wings start to be joined together.\nGiovanni Bertone produced torpedo and saloon bodies for FIAT and Lancia, and also for Itala, Diatto and SPA. He also worked on commissions for private customers eager for exclusivity. Alongside sports models like the 1928 Ansaldo 6BS, Giovanni Bertone also designed luxury cars like the Fiat 505 limousine and the Itala 51S, both in 1924. He later designed the Lancia Lambda VIII Series in 1928.\n\nDespite the fact that the depression of 1929 had brought many Turin carmakers to their knees, Giovanni Bertone's shrewd management allowed the company to carry on creating cars with great appeal. In 1932, Giovanni designed the imposingly elegant Lancia Artena, which was produced until 1936. In 1933; the following year, a corner stone event for the Carrozzeria Bertone occurred. This was that Nuccio Bertone, who was nineteen at the time, officially began working in his father's company. In the same period, Bertone began working on commercial vehicles, and as the business grew, new premises were needed. The company moved to Corso Peschiera 225. Gruppo Bertone now had fifty members of staff.\n\nIn 1934, Bertone created the Fiat 527S Ardita 2500, a turning point in car design, with some incredible new details such as the stunning front headlights with fairing along the bonnet. With the Ardita a new kind of style was created, destined to take off towards the end of the decade, with FIAT and Lancia models astounding for their day. Examples were the 'six window' FIAT 1500 Aerodinamica, the opulent Lancia Aprilia Cabriolet and the novel Fiat 1500 Torpedo, with structural features that had never been seen before, such as the fold-away hood which stowed away entirely inside the car. With Giovanni's bold innovations and elegant creations, he was highly appreciated by car experts and fans.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Second World War, the car market experienced a sudden, drastic downturn. Almost all the bodywork manufacturers, including Bertone, reacted to the crisis by turning to military vehicles of various kinds. The company created vehicles such as the Bertone ambulance on a Lancia Artena base. It was a hard time. The demand was scarce. Raw materials and labour was lacking. Military orders where difficult to fulfill. But production did not stop in the Corso Peschiera plant, some luxurious Lancia Aprilia are manufactured as well as the extremely elegant long chassis Fiat 2800 cabriolet, the only one of its kind, built on commission for race driver and motoring journalist Giovanni Lurani Cernuschi.\n\nAfter the war, as the long slow process of reconstruction began in Europe, the big industrial companies gradually scaled up their production levels, and the bodyworks got back to work. During these difficult years Nuccio Bertone created cars like the Lancia Aprilia Cabriolet and the Fiat 1100 Stanguellini racing car, which were precursors to some of the design trends in the following decade.\n\nAt the end of the 1940s, Nuccio Bertone turned to racing, at the wheel of a number of different cars, including a Fiat 500 Barchetta, which Nuccio built for himself. At the end of the decade the meeting with Vittorio Stanguellini led to the creation of a coupé with a Fiat 1100 chassis which got a high public appreciation..\n\nThe 1950s brought in the first orders from countries other than Italy, in particular from MG and Bristol Cars Limited in 1952. The following year, Nuccio Bertone designed the prototype for the Alfa Romeo Giulietta Sprint, which was presented at the 1954 Turin Motor Show. A production of 1000 was originally planned, but in the end nearly 40,000 vehicles were made between 1954 and 1965. The car ceased production in 1965.\n\nThe relationship between Bertone and Alfa Romeo reached its creative peak with the Berlinetta Aerodinamica Tecnica (BAT) concept cars which pushed back the boundaries of car design and aerodynamics: the BAT 5 in 1953, the BAT 7 in 1954 and the BAT 9 of 1955. Research into aerodynamics culminated in the production of the Abarth 750 Record in 1956, built on a Fiat 600 chassis and tested on the high speed track at Monza. This Abarth set an impressive ten world records, including doing at an average of 156.36 km/h and covering 10,125.26 km in 72 hours.\n\nIn 1957, the company expanded to start the production of the NSU Sport Prinz. The factory in Corso Peschiera could not cope with the forecasted production volumes. Construction work began in Grugliasco on the outskirts of Turin, for a new plant which became operative in 1959, with a workforce of 550. At the end of the 1950s, Bertone came up with some sports berlinetta which were to make history, such as the Giulietta Sprint Speciale, the Aston Martin DB2/4 and the Maserati 3500 GT.\n\nThe 1960s were the years of the Italian-style GT. Nuccio Bertone came up with five variations on the theme which would always be dear to his heart, in the shape of five extremely racy GT models: the Alfa Romeo 2600 Sprint, in coupé and cabriolet versions, two Ferrari 250 GTs, one named 'Wax' after the commissioning client, and the other for his personal use, the Aston Martin DB4 GT 'Jet' and the Maserati 5000 GT. At the same time, two new industrial partnerships were getting under way, with the work on the Simca 1000 Coupé and the BMW 3200 CS limited series, as was the important, but unfortunate ASA 1000, better known as the \"Ferrarina\", or \"little Ferrari\" (as the project originated with Enzo Ferrari), which, despite the high expectations of the public, never made it to the automobilemarket.\n\nThe Iso Rivolta GT 300, the Iso Rivolta GT 340 and the Iso Grifo were also created in the 1960s. Nuccio Bertone designed a prototype cabriolet of the latter and a racing version known as the A3C. The Grifo years were also the years of the Corvair Testudo, driven personally by Nuccio Bertone to the Geneva Motor Show in 1963. The following year saw the Alfa Romeo Canguro, followed in 1965 by the Alfa Romeo Giulia GT, the rightful heir of the Alfa Romeo Giulietta Sprint.\n\nIn 1965, Carrozzeria Bertone experienced a major turning-point, with the launch of the Fiat 850 Spider. The commercial success of this model led Nuccio Bertone to increase the company's production capacity to 120 units per day (between 1965 and 1972 nearly 140,000 were produced, the great majority of which were sold in the United States). With the Fiat 850, the company took a giant leap forward in terms of production volumes, from the 13,000 bodies produced in 1966 to nearly 30,000 in 1968, an increase of 40 percent.\n\nThe end of the 1960s saw the beginning of the partnership with Ferruccio Lamborghini that was destined to make history in the car world. The first vehicle to come out of this was the Lamborghini Miura, which presented at the 1966 Geneva Motor Show, which reinvented the high performance coupé design concept. The Miura was followed by the Marzal in 1967 and the Espada in 1968. In the same period, two other coupés appeared: the Alfa Romeo Montreal and the Fiat Dino Coupé, both out in 1967.\nAstounding, ground-breaking cars, inventing their own language for the design of the future: these were Nuccio Bertone's trademarks.\nAt the Paris Motor Show of 1968, he presented the Carabo concept car, based on an Alfa 33 chassis.\n\nBy 1970, Bertone had a workforce of 1,500 staff, and the Grugliasco factory covered an area of . The partnership with Lamborghini led to the development of the Lamborghini Espada, by 1973 known as the world's fastest four-seater. The design was inspired by an earlier concept, the Jaguar Pirana. After his initial success with the Espada he went on to design the Lamborghini Jarama and the Lamborghini Urraco. With the Stratos Zero prototype, which built on a Lancia Fulvia 1.6 HF base, Bertone came to represent a new point of reference in modern art, as well as on the international car design scene. The Stratos Zero, which was presented at the 1970 Turin Motor Show, evoked a timeless blend of architecture, sculpture and industrial design.\nThe following year, with some of the Zero's styling cues as a starting point, Bertone created the Lancia Stratos Stradale, a compact coupé destined mainly for the racing circuit, and which went on to win numerous victories in world rally championships.\n\nIn 1972, at the age of 88, Giovanni Bertone died.\nIn that year, as a tacit tribute to the company's founder, the Maserati Khamsin and the Fiat X1/9 were released. The latter, foreshadowed by the Runabout concept car, was the heir of the 850 Spider, and went on to enjoy the same runaway commercial success. Based on the Fiat 128 chassis but with a mid-rear-engine layout, the X1/9 was in production from 1972 to 1988, with 160,000 units manufactured.\n\nMeanwhile, Nuccio Bertone's prolific drawing board saw a succession of supercars, runabouts and provocative style concepts. These included the 1973 Series 3 version of the Lamborghini Espada, which redesigned the dashboard configuration, the Lamborghini Countach and the Ferrari 308 GT4 of 1973, the Audi 50 and Innocenti Mini 90 of 1974, the Fiat 131 Abarth Rally in 1975, and the prototype Alfa Romeo Navajo in 1976.\n\nIn the same year, the company began working for Volvo on the 264 TE. The Volvo 262C, which was presented at the 1977 Geneva Motor Show, was entirely manufactured by Bertone, from the assembly of the basic body to the fitting of the mechanical components and the road trials.\nThis procedural turning point had a big role in transforming the company, which was now set to become a car manufacturer in its own right.\n\nFrom the start of the 1980s, the Fiat Ritmo Cabrio and the Fiat X1/9 were produced and sold directly under the Bertone brand, meaning that the company was now responsible not only for production but also for the sales network and after-sales assistance for the two models.\n\nIn 1982, Nuccio Bertone turned out another important design, the Citroën BX. After entering into a joint-venture with Volvo in 1985 the company began production of the Volvo 780, a two-door saloon entirely created by Nuccio Bertone, from the formal design of the model to the full production cycle.\n\nA new commercial agreement drawn up with General Motors Europe in 1986 saw production of the Kadett Cabrio handed over to Bertone. The new Pontiac Fiero GT body design was also due to this relationship with the stile Bertone department of the company. The partnership with Opel continued with the first generation of the Vauxhall Astra Cabrio, and with the Astra Coupé and AstraCabriolet.\nThe end of the 1980s saw the Citroën XM, and the Freeclimber off-roader with mechanical components by Daihatsu and BMW engines.\n\nWithout abandoning its commitment to exploring the new languages of car design, Bertone entered the 1990s with its focus on technological innovations.\nCapturing the attention of public and experts alike at the 1992 Turin Motor Show was the aggressively futuristic Blitz barchetta, a showcar which featured an electric engine and avant-garde construction solutions. The barchetta had a tubular chassis in special steel integrated with sandwich-structuredfiber glass panels, bodywork in composite materials and carbon interiors.\n\nIn 1993 the Opel Astra Cabrio and the Fiat Punto Cabrio began production, with the entire production cycle for both cars at the Grugliasco factory; assembly of the bodywork, mechanical components integration, paintwork and fittings. A complete production cycle, ending with the final testing process, which is carried out according to the procedures and standards of the commissioning companies.\n\nIn 1994, continuing the company's research into low environmental-impact vehicles, Bertone presented the Zero Emission Record (ZER), a futuristic reinterpretation of the Abarth 750 Record. Expressly conceived and created to yield the highest performance levels in the electric car sector, the ZER (which has a Cx of 0.11) set the world one-hour-long distance record (199.822 km), and broke the 300 km/h barrier, setting the new world speed record for electric cars (with a top speed of 303.977 km/h).\n\nIn 1994, Gruppo Bertone became the first manufacturer in Italy to be awarded the ISO 9001 quality certification. Meanwhile, Nuccio Bertone did not turn his back on a past dedicated to bodywork and continued to design working prototypes; the Karisma in 1994, a four-seater berlinetta on a Porsche base, the Kayak in 1995, a coupé on a Lancia K base, the Slalom 'coupé de chasse' on an Opel Astra Coupe/Cabrio base, and the Fiat Enduro 4x4, a SUV based on a Fiat Brava floorpan.\n\nOn 26 February 1997, on the evening of the Geneva Motor Show, Nuccio Bertone died, \"one of the greatest coachbuilders of the century, and international Maestro of Italian style\" in the words of Fulvio Cinti, motoring journalist and car historian. His widow, Lilli Bertone, took over management of the company.\n\nWhile in the past car manufacturers had paid more attention to the engineering of a car than to its design, by the 1990s they had realized the importance of design to their brand's success and were increasingly bringing more of the creative work in house. This even applied to supercar manufacturers, who in the past had been a major client of the Italian design consultancies (carrozzeria). While Chinese and Indian manufacturers provided some work, this too decreased as once they gained confidence they too established their own in-house design studios. Despite these difficulties Bertone obtained some specialist manufacturing projects and continued with design consulting.\n\nHowever, by 2009, the worsening financial situation caused Bertone to sell its Grugliasco plant, along with its manufacturing activities to FIAT. Bertone underwent a major restructuring and became a fully integrated service company in the automotive, transportation and industrial design sectors. By then, Bertone workforce had reduced to roughly 300, mainly engineers and designers, with a capacity of 300,000 engineering hours per year, which allowed it to manage up to four prototype projects per year, from first style drafts to the effective manufacturing of the prototype.\n\nThe financial turmoil however continued, leading it to sell off some of its treasured collection of concept cars in 2011.\n\nAfter having ceased trading because of financial difficulties, Bertone on 18 March 2014 confirmed that it will be declared bankrupt if a suitable buyer was not found by the end of April.\n\nIn May 2013 the license rights of the brand were granted by Bertone Cento to Bertone Design, a company established in Milan, led by architect Aldo Cingolani with the aim of a reviving the brand in various fields, such as architecture, industrial design and fashion. Bertone Design also operates in the railway sector. Its most recent projects are the Frecciarossa 1000 Trenitalia and the regional train \"Jazz\" produced by Alstom; both will go into service in 2015.\n\nBertone Design claims continuity with the original company.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13684", "title": "Hildegard of Bingen", "text": "Hildegard of Bingen\n\nHildegard of Bingen (; ; 1098 – 17 September 1179), also known as Saint Hildegard and Sibyl of the Rhine, was a German Benedictine abbess, writer, composer, philosopher, Christian mystic, visionary, and polymath. She is considered to be the founder of scientific natural history in Germany.\n\nHildegard was elected \"magistra\" by her fellow nuns in 1136; she founded the monasteries of Rupertsberg in 1150 and Eibingen in 1165. One of her works as a composer, the \"Ordo Virtutum\", is an early example of liturgical drama and arguably the oldest surviving morality play. She wrote theological, botanical, and medicinal texts, as well as letters, liturgical songs, and poems, while supervising miniature illuminations in the Rupertsberg manuscript of her first work, \"Scivias\". She is also noted for the invention of a constructed language known as \"Lingua Ignota\".\n\nAlthough the history of her formal consideration is complicated, she has been recognized as a saint by branches of the Roman Catholic Church for centuries. On 7 October 2012, Pope Benedict XVI named her a Doctor of the Church.\n\nHildegard was born around the year 1098, although the exact date is uncertain. Her parents were Mechtild of Merxheim-Nahet and Hildebert of Bermersheim, a family of the free lower nobility in the service of the Count Meginhard of Sponheim. Sickly from birth, Hildegard is traditionally considered their youngest and tenth child, although there are records of only seven older siblings. In her \"Vita\", Hildegard states that from a very young age she had experienced visions.\n\nPerhaps because of Hildegard's visions, or as a method of political positioning (or both), Hildegard's parents offered her as an oblate to the Benedictine monastery at the Disibodenberg, which had been recently reformed in the Palatinate Forest. The date of Hildegard's enclosure at the monastery is the subject of debate. Her \"Vita\" says she was professed with an older woman, Jutta, the daughter of Count Stephan II of Sponheim, at the age of eight. However, Jutta's date of enclosure is known to have been in 1112, when Hildegard would have been fourteen. Their vows were received by Bishop Otto Bamberg on All Saints' Day, 1112. Some scholars speculate that Hildegard was placed in the care of Jutta at the age of eight, and the two women were then enclosed together six years later.\n\nIn any case, Hildegard and Jutta were enclosed together at the Disibodenberg, and formed the core of a growing community of women attached to the male monastery. Jutta was also a visionary and thus attracted many followers who came to visit her at the cloister. Hildegard tells us that Jutta taught her to read and write, but that she was unlearned and therefore incapable of teaching Hildegard sound biblical interpretation. The written record of the \"Life of Jutta\" indicates that Hildegard probably assisted her in reciting the psalms, working in the garden and other handiwork, and tending to the sick. This might have been a time when Hildegard learned how to play the ten-stringed psaltery. Volmar, a frequent visitor, may have taught Hildegard simple psalm notation. The time she studied music could have been the beginning of the compositions she would later create.\n\nUpon Jutta's death in 1136, Hildegard was unanimously elected as \"magistra\" of the community by her fellow nuns. Abbot Kuno of Disibodenberg asked Hildegard to be Prioress, which would be under his authority. Hildegard, however, wanted more independence for herself and her nuns, and asked Abbot Kuno to allow them to move to Rupertsberg. This was to be a move towards poverty, from a stone complex that was well established to a temporary dwelling place. When the abbot declined Hildegard's proposition, Hildegard went over his head and received the approval of Archbishop Henry I of Mainz. Abbot Kuno did not relent until Hildegard was stricken by an illness that kept her paralyzed and unable to move from her bed, an event that she attributed to God's unhappiness at her not following his orders to move her nuns to a new location in Rupertsberg. It was only when the Abbot himself could not move Hildegard that he decided to grant the nuns their own monastery. Hildegard and about twenty nuns thus moved to the St. Rupertsberg monastery in 1150, where Volmar served as provost, as well as Hildegard's confessor and scribe. In 1165 Hildegard founded a second monastery for her nuns at Eibingen.\n\nBefore Hildegard's death, a problem arose with the clergy of Mainz. A man buried in Rupertsburg had died after excommunication from the Church. Therefore, the clergy wanted to remove his body from the sacred ground. Hildegard did not accept this idea, replying that it was a sin and that the man had been reconciled to the church at the time of his death.\n\nHildegard said that she first saw \"The Shade of the Living Light\" at the age of three, and by the age of five she began to understand that she was experiencing visions. She used the term 'visio' (the Latin for \"vision\") to describe this feature of her experience, and recognized that it was a gift that she could not explain to others. Hildegard explained that she saw all things in the light of God through the five senses: sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch. Hildegard was hesitant to share her visions, confiding only to Jutta, who in turn told Volmar, Hildegard's tutor and, later, secretary. Throughout her life, she continued to have many visions, and in 1141, at the age of 42, Hildegard received a vision she believed to be an instruction from God, to \"write down that which you see and hear.\" Still hesitant to record her visions, Hildegard became physically ill. The illustrations recorded in the book of Scivias were visions that Hildegard experienced, causing her great suffering and tribulations. In her first theological text, \"Scivias\" (\"Know the Ways\"), Hildegard describes her struggle within:\n\nBut I, though I saw and heard these things, refused to write for a long time through doubt and bad opinion and the diversity of human words, not with stubbornness but in the exercise of humility, until, laid low by the scourge of God, I fell upon a bed of sickness; then, compelled at last by many illnesses, and by the witness of a certain noble maiden of good conduct [the nun Richardis von Stade] and of that man whom I had secretly sought and found, as mentioned above, I set my hand to the writing. While I was doing it, I sensed, as I mentioned before, the deep profundity of scriptural exposition; and, raising myself from illness by the strength I received, I brought this work to a close – though just barely – in ten years. (...) And I spoke and wrote these things not by the invention of my heart or that of any other person, but as by the secret mysteries of God I heard and received them in the heavenly places. And again I heard a voice from Heaven saying to me, 'Cry out therefore, and write thus!'\n\nIt was between November 1147 and February 1148 at the synod in Trier that Pope Eugenius heard about Hildegard's writings. It was from this that she received Papal approval to document her visions as revelations from the Holy Spirit giving her instant credence.\n\nOn 17 September 1179, when Hildegard died, her sisters claimed they saw two streams of light appear in the skies and cross over the room where she was dying.\n\nHildegard's hagiography, \"Vita Sanctae Hildegardis\", was compiled by the monk Theoderic of Echternach after Hildegard's death. He included the hagiographical work \"Libellus\" or \"Little Book\" begun by Godfrey of Disibodenberg. Godfrey had died before he was able to complete his work. Guibert of Gembloux was invited to finish the work; however, he had to return to his monastery with the project unfinished. Theoderic utilized sources Guibert had left behind to complete the \"Vita\".\n\nHildegard's works include three great volumes of visionary theology; a variety of musical compositions for use in liturgy, as well as the musical morality play \"Ordo Virtutum\"; one of the largest bodies of letters (nearly 400) to survive from the Middle Ages, addressed to correspondents ranging from popes to emperors to abbots and abbesses, and including records of many of the sermons she preached in the 1160s and 1170s; two volumes of material on natural medicine and cures; an invented language called the \"Lingua ignota\" (\"unknown language\"); and various minor works, including a gospel commentary and two works of hagiography.\n\nSeveral manuscripts of her works were produced during her lifetime, including the illustrated Rupertsberg manuscript of her first major work, \"Scivias\" (lost since 1945); the Dendermonde Codex, which contains one version of her musical works; and the Ghent manuscript, which was the first fair-copy made for editing of her final theological work, the \"Liber Divinorum Operum\". At the end of her life, and probably under her initial guidance, all of her works were edited and gathered into the single Riesenkodex manuscript.\n\nHildegard's most significant works were her three volumes of visionary theology: \"Scivias\" (\"Know the Ways\", composed 1142–1151), \"Liber Vitae Meritorum\" (\"Book of Life's Merits\" or \"Book of the Rewards of Life\", composed 1158–1163); and \"Liber Divinorum Operum\" (\"Book of Divine Works\", also known as \"De operatione Dei\", \"On God's Activity\", composed 1163/4–1172 or 1174). In these volumes, the last of which was completed when she was well into her seventies, Hildegard first describes each vision, whose details are often strange and enigmatic, and then interprets their theological contents in the words of the \"voice of the Living Light.\"\n\nThe composition of the first work, \"Scivias\", was triggered by the insistence of her visionary experiences in about 1142, when she was already forty-three years old. Perceiving a divine command to \"write down what you see and hear\", Hildegard began to record her visionary experiences. \"Scivias\" is structured into three parts of unequal length. The first part (six visions) chronicles the order of God's creation: the Creation and Fall of Adam and Eve, the structure of the universe (famously described as the shape of an \"egg\"), the relationship between body and soul, God's relationship to his people through the Synagogue, and the choirs of angels. The second part (seven visions) describes the order of redemption: the coming of Christ the Redeemer, the Trinity, the Church as the Bride of Christ and the Mother of the Faithful in baptism and confirmation, the orders of the Church, Christ's sacrifice on the Cross and the Eucharist, and the fight against the devil. Finally, the third part (thirteen visions) recapitulates the history of salvation told in the first two parts, symbolized as a building adorned with various allegorical figures and virtues. It concludes with the Symphony of Heaven, an early version of Hildegard's musical compositions.\n\nPortions of the uncompleted work were read aloud to Pope Eugenius III at the Synod of Trier in 1148, after which he sent Hildegard a letter with his blessing. This blessing was later construed as papal approval for all of Hildegard's wide-ranging theological activities. Towards the end of her life, Hildegard commissioned a richly decorated manuscript of \"Scivias\" (the Rupertsberg Codex); although the original has been lost since its evacuation to Dresden for safekeeping in 1945, its images are preserved in a hand-painted facsimile from the 1920s.\n\nIn her second volume of visionary theology, composed between 1158 and 1163, after she had moved her community of nuns into independence at the Rupertsberg in Bingen, Hildegard tackled the moral life in the form of dramatic confrontations between the virtues and the vices. She had already explored this area in her musical morality play, \"Ordo Virtutum\", and the \"Book of the Rewards of Life\" takes up that play's characteristic themes. Each vice, although ultimately depicted as ugly and grotesque, nevertheless offers alluring, seductive speeches that attempt to entice the unwary soul into their clutches. Standing in our defense, however, are the sober voices of the Virtues, powerfully confronting every vicious deception.\n\nAmongst the work's innovations is one of the earliest descriptions of purgatory as the place where each soul would have to work off its debts after death before entering heaven. Hildegard's descriptions of the possible punishments there are often gruesome and grotesque, which emphasize the work's moral and pastoral purpose as a practical guide to the life of true penance and proper virtue.\n\nHildegard's last and grandest visionary work had its genesis in one of the few times she experienced something like an ecstatic loss of consciousness. As she described it in an autobiographical passage included in her Vita, sometime in about 1163, she received \"an extraordinary mystical vision\" in which was revealed the \"sprinkling drops of sweet rain\" that John the Evangelist experienced when he wrote, \"In the beginning was the Word...\" (John 1:1). Hildegard perceived that this Word was the key to the \"Work of God\", of which humankind is the pinnacle. The \"Book of Divine Works\", therefore, became in many ways an extended explication of the Prologue to John's Gospel.\n\nThe ten visions of this work's three parts are cosmic in scale, to illustrate various ways of understanding the relationship between God and his creation. Often, that relationship is established by grand allegorical female figures representing Divine Love (\"Caritas\") or Wisdom (\"Sapientia\"). The first vision opens the work with a salvo of poetic and visionary images, swirling about to characterize God's dynamic activity within the scope of his work within the history of salvation. The remaining three visions of the first part introduce the famous image of a human being standing astride the spheres that make up the universe, and detail the intricate relationships between the human as microcosm and the universe as macrocosm. This culminates in the final chapter of Part One, Vision Four with Hildegard's commentary on the Prologue to John's Gospel (John 1:1-14), a direct rumination on the meaning of \"In the beginning was the Word...\" The single vision that comprises the whole of Part Two stretches that rumination back to the opening of Genesis, and forms an extended commentary on the seven days of the creation of the world told in Genesis 1-2:3. This commentary interprets each day of creation in three ways: literal or cosmological; allegorical or ecclesiological (i.e. related to the Church's history); and moral or tropological (i.e. related to the soul's growth in virtue). Finally, the five visions of the third part take up again the building imagery of \"Scivias\" to describe the course of salvation history. The final vision (3.5) contains Hildegard's longest and most detailed prophetic program of the life of the Church from her own days of \"womanish weakness\" through to the coming and ultimate downfall of the Antichrist.\n\nAttention in recent decades to women of the medieval Church has led to a great deal of popular interest in Hildegard's music. In addition to the \"Ordo Virtutum,\" sixty-nine musical compositions, each with its own original poetic text, survive, and at least four other texts are known, though their musical notation has been lost. This is one of the largest repertoires among medieval composers.\nOne of her better known works, \"Ordo Virtutum\" (\"Play of the Virtues\"), is a morality play. It is uncertain when some of Hildegard's compositions were composed, though the \"Ordo Virtutum\" is thought to have been composed as early as 1151. The morality play consists of monophonic melodies for the Anima (human soul) and 16 Virtues. There is also one speaking part for the Devil. Scholars assert that the role of the Devil would have been played by Volmar, while Hildegard's nuns would have played the parts of Anima and the Virtues.\n\nIn addition to the \"Ordo Virtutum\", Hildegard composed many liturgical songs that were collected into a cycle called the \"Symphonia armoniae celestium revelationum\". The songs from the Symphonia are set to Hildegard's own text and range from antiphons, hymns, and sequences, to responsories. Her music is described as monophonic, that is, consisting of exactly one melodic line. Its style is characterized by soaring melodies that can push the boundaries of the more staid ranges of traditional Gregorian chant. Though Hildegard's music is often thought to stand outside the normal practices of monophonic monastic chant, current researchers are also exploring ways in which it may be viewed in comparison with her contemporaries, such as Hermannus Contractus. Another feature of Hildegard's music that both reflects twelfth-century evolutions of chant and pushes those evolutions further is that it is highly melismatic, often with recurrent melodic units. Scholars such as Margot Fassler, Marianne Richert Pfau, and Beverly Lomer also note the intimate relationship between music and text in Hildegard's compositions, whose rhetorical features are often more distinct than is common in twelfth-century chant. As with all medieval chant notation, Hildegard's music lacks any indication of tempo or rhythm; the surviving manuscripts employ late German style notation, which uses very ornamental neumes. The reverence for the Virgin Mary reflected in music shows how deeply influenced and inspired Hildegard of Bingen and her community were by the Virgin Mary and the saints.\n\nThe definition of viriditas or \"greenness\" is an earthly expression of the heavenly in an integrity that overcomes dualisms. This greenness or power of life appears frequently in Hildegard's works.\n\nDespite Hildegard's self-professed view that her compositions have as object the praise of God, one scholar has asserted that Hildegard made a close association between music and the female body in her musical compositions. According to him, the poetry and music of Hildegard's Symphonia would therefore be concerned with the anatomy of female desire thus described as Sapphonic, or pertaining to Sappho, connecting her to a history of female rhetoricians.\n\nHildegard's medicinal and scientific writings, though thematically complementary to her ideas about nature expressed in her visionary works, are different in focus and scope. Neither claim to be rooted in her visionary experience and its divine authority. Rather, they spring from her experience helping in and then leading the monastery's herbal garden and infirmary, as well as the theoretical information she likely gained through her wide-ranging reading in the monastery's library. As she gained practical skills in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, she combined physical treatment of physical diseases with holistic methods centered on \"spiritual healing.\" She became well known for her healing powers involving practical application of tinctures, herbs, and precious stones. She combined these elements with a theological notion ultimately derived from Genesis: all things put on earth are for the use of humans. In addition to her hands-on experience, she also gained medical knowledge, including elements of her humoral theory, from traditional Latin texts.\n\nHildegard catalogued both her theory and practice in two works. The first, \"Physica,\" contains nine books that describe the scientific and medicinal properties of various plants, stones, fish, reptiles, and animals. The second, \"Causae et Curae\", is an exploration of the human body, its connections to the rest of the natural world, and the causes and cures of various diseases. Hildegard documented various medical practices in these books, including the use of bleeding and home remedies for many common ailments. She also explains remedies for common agricultural injuries such as burns, fractures, dislocations, and cuts. Hildegard may have used the books to teach assistants at the monastery. These books are historically significant because they show areas of medieval medicine that were not well documented because their practitioners (mainly women) rarely wrote in Latin. Her writings were commentated on by Mélanie Lipinska, a Polish scientist\n\nIn addition to its wealth of practical evidence, \"Causae et Curae\" is also noteworthy for its organizational scheme. Its first part sets the work within the context of the creation of the cosmos and then humanity as its summit, and the constant interplay of the human person as microcosm both physically and spiritually with the macrocosm of the universe informs all of Hildegard's approach. Her hallmark is to emphasize the vital connection between the \"green\" health of the natural world and the holistic health of the human person. \"Viriditas\", or greening power, was thought to sustain human beings and could be manipulated by adjusting the balance of elements within a person. Thus, when she approached medicine as a type of gardening, it was not just as an analogy. Rather, Hildegard understood the plants and elements of the garden as direct counterparts to the humors and elements within the human body, whose imbalance led to illness and disease.\n\nThus, the nearly three hundred chapters of the second book of \"Causae et Curae\" \"explore the etiology, or causes, of disease as well as human sexuality, psychology, and physiology.\" In this section, she give specific instructions for bleeding based on various factors, including gender, the phase of the moon (bleeding is best done when moon is waning), the place of disease (use veins near diseased organ of body part) or prevention (big veins in arms), and how much blood to take (described in imprecise measurements, like \"the amount that a thirsty person can swallow in one gulp\"). She even includes bleeding instructions for animals to keep them healthy. In the third and fourth sections, Hildegard describes treatments for malignant and minor problems and diseases according to the humoral theory, again including information on animal health. The fifth section is about diagnosis and prognosis, which includes instructions to check the patient's blood, pulse, urine and stool. Finally, the sixth section documents a lunar horoscope to provide an additional means of prognosis for both disease and other medical conditions, such as conception and the outcome of pregnancy. For example, she indicates that a waxing moon is good for human conception and is also good for sowing seeds for plants (sowing seeds is the plant equivalent of conception). Elsewhere, Hildegard is even said to have stressed the value of boiling drinking water in an attempt to prevent infection.\n\nAs Hildegard elaborates the medical and scientific relationship between the human microcosm and the macrocosm of the universe, she often focuses on interrelated patterns of four: \"the four elements (fire, air, water, and earth), the four seasons, the four humors, the four zones of the earth, and the four major winds.\" Although she inherited the basic framework of humoral theory from ancient medicine, Hildegard's conception of the hierarchical inter-balance of the four humors (blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile) was unique, based on their correspondence to \"superior\" and \"inferior\" elements—blood and phlegm corresponding to the \"celestial\" elements of fire and air, and the two biles corresponding to the \"terrestrial\" elements of water and earth. Hildegard understood the disease-causing imbalance of these humors to result from the improper dominance of the subordinate humors. This disharmony reflects that introduced by Adam and Eve in the Fall, which for Hildegard marked the indelible entrance of disease and humoral imbalance into humankind. As she writes in \"Causae et Curae\" c. 42:\n\nIt happens that certain men suffer diverse illnesses. This comes from the phlegm which is superabundant within them. For if man had remained in paradise, he would not have had the \"flegmata\" within his body, from which many evils proceed, but his flesh would have been whole and without dark humor [\"livor\"]. However, because he consented to evil and relinquished good, he was made into a likeness of the earth, which produces good and useful herbs, as well as bad and useless ones, and which has in itself both good and evil moistures. From tasting evil, the blood of the sons of Adam was turned into the poison of semen, out of which the sons of man are begotten. And therefore their flesh is ulcerated and permeable [to disease]. These sores and openings create a certain storm and smoky moisture in men, from which the \"flegmata\" arise and coagulate, which then introduce diverse infirmities to the human body. All this arose from the first evil, which man began at the start, because if Adam had remained in paradise, he would have had the sweetest health, and the best dwelling-place, just as the strongest balsam emits the best odor; but on the contrary, man now has within himself poison and phlegm and diverse illnesses.\n\nHildegard also invented an alternative alphabet. The text of her writing and compositions reveals Hildegard's use of this form of modified medieval Latin, encompassing many invented, conflated and abridged words. Because of her inventions of words for her lyrics and use of a constructed script, many conlangers look upon her as a medieval precursor. Scholars believe that Hildegard used her \"Lingua Ignota\" to increase solidarity among her nuns.\n\nMaddocks claims that it is likely Hildegard learned simple Latin and the tenets of the Christian faith but was not instructed in the Seven Liberal Arts, which formed the basis of all education for the learned classes in the Middle Ages: the \"Trivium\" of grammar, dialectic, and rhetoric plus the \"Quadrivium\" of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music. The correspondence she kept with the outside world, both spiritual and social, transcended the cloister as a space of spiritual confinement and served to document Hildegard's grand style and strict formatting of medieval letter writing.\n\nContributing to Christian European rhetorical traditions, Hildegard \"authorized herself as a theologian\" through alternative rhetorical arts. Hildegard was creative in her interpretation of theology. She believed that her monastery should exclude novices who were not from the nobility because she did not want her community to be divided on the basis of social status. She also stated that \"woman may be made from man, but no man can be made without a woman.\"\nBecause of church limitation on public, discursive rhetoric, the medieval rhetorical arts included preaching, letter writing, poetry, and the encyclopedic tradition. Hildegard's participation in these arts speaks to her significance as a female rhetorician, transcending bans on women's social participation and interpretation of scripture. The acceptance of public preaching by a woman, even a well-connected abbess and acknowledged prophet, does not fit the stereotype of this time. Her preaching was not limited to the monasteries; she preached publicly in 1160 in Germany. (New York: Routledge, 2001, 9). She conducted four preaching tours throughout Germany, speaking to both clergy and laity in chapter houses and in public, mainly denouncing clerical corruption and calling for reform.\n\nMany abbots and abbesses asked her for prayers and opinions on various matters. She traveled widely during her four preaching tours. She had several devoted followers, including Guibert of Gembloux, who wrote to her frequently and became her secretary after Volmar's death in 1173. Hildegard also influenced several monastic women, exchanging letters with Elisabeth of Schönau, a nearby visionary.\n\nHildegard corresponded with popes such as Eugene III and Anastasius IV, statesmen such as Abbot Suger, German emperors such as Frederick I Barbarossa, and other notable figures such as Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, who advanced her work, at the behest of her abbot, Kuno, at the Synod of Trier in 1147 and 1148. Hildegard of Bingen's correspondence is an important component of her literary output.\n\nHildegard was one of the first persons for whom the Roman canonization process was officially applied, but the process took so long that four attempts at canonization were not completed and she remained at the level of her beatification. Her name was nonetheless taken up in the Roman Martyrology at the end of the 16th century. Her feast day is 17 September. Numerous popes have referred to Hildegard as a saint, including Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI.\n\nOn 10 May 2012, Pope Benedict XVI extended the liturgical cult of St. Hildegard to the entire Catholic Church in a process known as \"equivalent canonization,\" thus laying the groundwork for naming her a Doctor of the Church. On 7 October 2012, the feast of the Holy Rosary, the pope named her a Doctor of the Church, the fourth woman of 35 saints given that title by the Roman Catholic Church. He called her \"perennially relevant\" and \"an authentic teacher of theology and a profound scholar of natural science and music.\"\n\nHildegard of Bingen also appears in the calendar of saints of various Anglican churches, such as that of the Church of England, in which she is commemorated on 17 September.\n\nHildegard's parish and pilgrimage church in Eibingen near Rüdesheim houses her relics.\n\nIn recent years, Hildegard has become of particular interest to feminist scholars. They note her reference to herself as a member of the weaker sex and her rather constant belittling of women. Hildegard frequently referred to herself as an unlearned woman, completely incapable of Biblical exegesis. Such a statement on her part, however, worked to her advantage because it made her statements that all of her writings and music came from visions of the Divine more believable, therefore giving Hildegard the authority to speak in a time and place where few women were permitted a voice. Hildegard used her voice to amplify the Church's condemnation of institutional corruption, in particular simony.\n\nHildegard has also become a figure of reverence within the contemporary New Age movement, mostly because of her holistic and natural view of healing, as well as her status as a mystic. Though her medical writings were long neglected, and then studied without reference to their context, she was the inspiration for Dr. Gottfried Hertzka's \"Hildegard-Medicine\", and is the namesake for June Boyce-Tillman's Hildegard Network, a healing center that focuses on a holistic approach to wellness and brings together people interested in exploring the links between spirituality, the arts, and healing. Her reputation as a medicinal writer and healer was also used by early feminists to argue for women's rights to attend medical schools. Hildegard's reincarnation has been debated since 1924 when Austrian mystic Rudolf Steiner lectured that a nun of her description was the past life of Russian poet philosopher Vladimir Soloviev, whose Sophianic visions are often compared to Hildegard's. Sophiologist Robert Powell writes that hermetic astrology proves the match, while mystical communities in Hildegard's lineage include that of artist Carl Schroeder as studied by Columbia sociologist Courtney Bender and supported by reincarnation researchers Walter Semkiw and Kevin Ryerson.\n\nRecordings and performances of Hildegard's music have gained critical praise and popularity since 1979. See Discography listed below.\n\nThe following modern musical works are directly linked to Hildegard and her music or texts:\n\nThe artwork \"The Dinner Party\" features a place setting for Hildegard.\n\nIn space, the minor planet 898 Hildegard is named for her.\n\nIn film, Hildegard has been portrayed by Patricia Routledge in a BBC documentary called \"Hildegard of Bingen\" (1994), by Ángela Molina in \"Barbarossa\" (2009) and by Barbara Sukowa in the film \"Vision\", directed by Margarethe von Trotta.\n\nHildegard was the subject of a 2012 fictionalized biographic novel \"Illuminations\" by Mary Sharratt.\n\nThe plant genus \"Hildegardia\" is named after her because of her contributions to herbal medicine.\n\nHildegard makes an appearance in \"The Baby-Sitters Club #101: Claudia Kishi, Middle School Drop-Out\" by Ann M. Martin, when Anna Stevenson dresses as Hildegard for Halloween. \n\nA feature documentary film, \",\" was released by American director Michael M. Conti in 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Sources (in translation):\nHildegard of Bingen. \n\nSecondary Sources:\n\n"}
{"id": "475878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=475878", "title": "Ibero-American Exposition of 1929", "text": "Ibero-American Exposition of 1929\n\nThe Ibero-American Exposition of 1929 (Spanish: Exposición iberoamericana de 1929) was a world's fair held in Seville, Spain, from 9 May 1929 until 21 June 1930. Countries in attendance of the exposition included: Portugal, the United States, Brazil, Uruguay, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, Chile, the Republic of Colombia, Cuba, Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, Bolivia, Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Ecuador. Each Spanish region and each of the provinces of Andalusia were also represented. Spain’s Dictator General Miguel Primo de Rivera gave the opening address. Primo de Rivera allowed the Spanish King Alfonso XIII to give the final words and officially open the exposition. The purpose of the exposition was to improve relations between Spain and the countries in attendance, all of which have historical ties with Spain through colonization (parts of Spanish America and the United States) or political union (Portugal and its former colony Brazil). Other countries were represented at the \"International section\" in Barcelona.\nThe exposition was smaller in scale than the International Exposition held in Barcelona during that same year, but it was not lacking in style. The city of Seville had prepared for the Exposition over the course of 19 years. The exhibition buildings were constructed in María Luisa Park along the Guadalquivir River. A majority of the buildings were built to remain permanent after the closing of the exposition. Many of the foreign buildings, including the United States exhibition building, were to be used as consulates after the closing of the exhibits. By the opening of the exposition all of the buildings were complete, although many were no longer new. Not long before the opening of the Exposition, the Spanish government also began a modernization of the city in order to prepare for the expected crowds by erecting new hotels and widening the medieval streets to allow for the movement of automobiles.\n\nSpain spent a large amount of money in developing its exhibits for the fair and constructed elaborate buildings to hold them. The exhibits were designed to show the social and economic progress of Spain as well as expressing its culture. Spanish architect Aníbal González designed the largest and most famous of the buildings, which surrounded the Plaza de España. The largest of the exhibits housed in this building was located in the “Salón del Descubrimento de América.” The \"Salón\" contained documents, maps, and other objects related to the discovery of the Americas, including a set of 120 letters and manuscript that had belonged to Christopher Columbus, the last testament of Hernán Cortés, and detailed dioramas of historic moments. An exact replica of Columbus's ship the \"Santa María,\" complete with a costumed crew, floated on the Guadalquivir River. The cities of Spain contributed structures designed to reflect their unique cultures to be placed in the \"Pabellones de las regiones españolas\" (\"Pavilions of the Spanish regions\"). Spain’s exhibits also included a large collection of art located in the Palacio Mudéjar (\"Mudéjar art palace\"), Palacio Renacimiento (\"Renaissance palace\"), and the Palacio de la Casa Real (\"Palace of the Royal House\"). The Institute of Art from the University of Seville was moved to the Palacio Mudéjar for the duration of the exposition on the permission gained from the exposition committee by Count Columbi. The committee also set aside funds from their budget to purchase materials for the Institute.\n\nThe United States' contribution to the exposition consisted of three buildings and marked the end to a several year period in which the United States did not construct buildings for foreign expositions. The main building was to serve as the U.S. consulate office after the closing of the Ibero-American exposition, and housed a menagerie of electrical appliances including oil furnaces, electric refrigerators, airplane models, and miniature wind tunnels. The other two structures housed a movie theatre and government exhibits, including contributions from the Departments of Agriculture, Treasury, and Labor, the Commission of Fine Arts, the Navy, and the Library of Congress.\n\nOf the Ibero-American nations in attendance of the exposition, 10 constructed pavilions to display their exhibits. Other nations, including Bolivia, Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Ecuador displayed their native products in the \"Galerías comerciales americanas\" (\"Commercial galleries of the Americas\").\nThe largest of the ten pavilions was the Peruvian pavilion, which was designed by the architect Don Manuel Piqueras Cotolí. The pavilion contained a large archeology collection consisting of three halls filled with pre-Columbian era artifacts, which were to be kept on permanent display. The pavilion also contained an agricultural exhibit filled with stuffed vicuñas, alpacas, llamas, and guanacos. The exhibit was complemented by a pack of live llamas grazing on the pavilion grounds.\n\nThe Republic of Colombia constructed a pavilion designed by Seville architect José Granados. The pavilion included a collection of sculpture and artwork by Colombian artist Rómulo Rozo, and of Colombian emeralds, and a coffee café that demonstrated all of the steps in coffee cultivation.\n\nThe Brazilian pavilion also contained a coffee cultivation exhibit complete with panoramas and models illustrating the different phases of cultivation. Architect Pedro Paulo Bernardes Bastos designed the pavilion, which also included a coffee bar.\n\nChilean architect designed the three-story building that served as home to Chile's exhibits. The exhibits included displays of Chilean industries, including detailed replicas of a nitrate mine and a copper plant, Araucanian arts and crafts, and galleries displaying Chilean art and history.\n\nThe Mexican pavilion, designed by Manuel Amabilis, included exhibits on archeology, education, and the history of Spanish accomplishments in Mexico. Students in Mexican schools prepared some of the education exhibits.\n\nArchitect Martin Noel designed Argentina's pavilion, which included a movie theatre and displays focusing on Argentinean industries and products.\n\nUruguay's pavilion included displays of its industrial schools, including the Institute of Agronomy and an art gallery filled with paintings and bronze sculptures.\n\nCuba contributed demonstrations of the sugar and tobacco industries to the exposition in their pavilion.\n\nThe Dominican Republic pavilion included a reproduction of the Columbus's Alcázar.\n\nGuatemala signed up late for the exhibition and as a result rather than resembling a huge palace its pavilion looks more like a school portable building with blue and white tiles on the front. The building contained exhibits relating to the resources found in Guatemala.\n\nVenezuela also erected a pavilion containing displays of its resources.\nToday, many of the pavilions from the exposition remain, notably the famous Plaza de España, which chronicles each of the regions of Spain in ceramic provincial alcoves and benches, as well as some of the national pavilions, which have now been converted to Consulate-Generals.

{"id": "15085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15085", "title": "Iconoclasm", "text": "Iconoclasm\n\nIconoclasm is the social belief in the importance of the destruction of icons and other images or monuments, most frequently for religious or political reasons. People who engage in or support iconoclasm are called \"iconoclasts\", a term that has come to be applied figuratively to any individual who challenges \"cherished beliefs or venerated institutions on the grounds that they are erroneous or pernicious\". \n\nConversely, one who reveres or venerates religious images is called (by iconoclasts) an \"iconolater\"; in a Byzantine context, such a person is called an \"iconodule\" or \"iconophile\".\n\nThe term does not generally encompass the specific destruction of images of a ruler after his death or overthrow (\"damnatio memoriae\").\n\nIconoclasm may be carried out by people of a different religion, but is often the result of sectarian disputes between factions of the same religion. Within Christianity, iconoclasm has generally been motivated by those who adopt a literal interpretation of the Ten Commandments, which forbid the making and worshipping of \"graven images or any likeness of anything\". The later Church Fathers identified Jews, fundamental iconoclasts, with heresy and saw deviations from orthodox Christianity and opposition to the veneration of images as heresies that were essentially \"Jewish in spirit\". The degree of iconoclasm among Christian branches greatly varies. Islam, in general, tends to be more iconoclastic than Christianity, with Sunni Islam being more iconoclastic than Shia Islam.\n\nIn the Bronze Age, the most significant episode of iconoclasm occurred in Egypt during the Amarna Period, when Akhenaten, based in his new capital of Akhetaten, instituted a significant shift in Egyptian artistic styles alongside a campaign of intolerance towards the traditional gods and a new emphasis on a state monolatristic tradition focused on the god Aten, the Sun disk— many temples and monuments were destroyed as a result:\n\nIn rebellion against the old religion and the powerful priests of Amun, Akhenaten ordered the eradication of all of Egypt's traditional gods. He sent royal officials to chisel out and destroy every reference to Amun and the names of other deities on tombs, temple walls, and cartouches to instill in the people that the Aten was the one true god.\n\nPublic references to Akhenaten were destroyed soon after his death.\n\nComparing the ancient Egyptians with the Israelites, Jan Assmann writes:\n\nFor Egypt, the greatest horror was the destruction or abduction of the cult images. In the eyes of the Israelites, the erection of images meant the destruction of divine presence; in the eyes of the Egyptians, this same effect was attained by the destruction of images. In Egypt, iconoclasm was the most terrible religious crime; in Israel, the most terrible religious crime was idolatry. In this respect Osarseph alias Akhenaten, the iconoclast, and the Golden Calf, the paragon of idolatry, correspond to each other inversely, and it is strange that Aaron could so easily avoid the role of the religious criminal. It is more than probable that these traditions evolved under mutual influence. In this respect, Moses and Akhenaten became, after all, closely related.\n\nAlthough widespread use of Christian iconography only began as Christianity increasingly spread among gentiles after the legalization of Christianity by Roman Emperor Constantine (c. 312 AD), scattered expressions of opposition to the use of images were reported (e.g. Spanish Synod of Elvira). The period after the reign of Byzantine Emperor Justinian (527–565) evidently saw a huge increase in the use of images, both in volume and quality, and a gathering aniconic reaction.\n\nIn the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, government-led iconoclasm began with Byzantine Emperor Leo III, following what seems to have been a long period of rising opposition to the use or misuse of images. The religious conflict created political and economic divisions in Byzantine society. It was generally supported by the Eastern, poorer, non-Greek peoples of the Empire who had to deal frequently with raids from the new Muslim Empire. On the other hand, the wealthier Greeks of Constantinople, and also the peoples of the Balkan and Italian provinces, strongly opposed iconoclasm.\n\nWithin the Byzantine Empire the government had probably been adopting Christian images more frequently. One notable change came in 695, when Justinian II's government added a full-face image of Christ on the obverse of imperial gold coins. The change caused the Caliph Abd al-Malik to stop his earlier adoption of Byzantine coin types. He started a purely Islamic coinage with lettering only. A letter by the Patriarch Germanus written before 726 to two Iconoclast bishops says that \"now whole towns and multitudes of people are in considerable agitation over this matter\" but there is little written evidence of the debate.\nThe first iconoclastic wave happened in Wittenberg in the early 1520s under reformers Thomas Müntzer and Andreas Karlstadt. It prompted Martin Luther, then concealing as \"Junker Jörg\", to intervene.\n\nIn contrast to the Lutherans who favoured sacred art in their churches and homes, the Reformed (Calvinist) leaders, in particular Andreas Karlstadt, Huldrych Zwingli and John Calvin, encouraged the removal of religious images by invoking the Decalogue's prohibition of idolatry and the manufacture of graven (sculpted) images of God. As a result, individuals attacked statues and images. However, in most cases, civil authorities removed images in an orderly manner in the newly Reformed Protestant cities and territories of Europe. \n\nSignificant iconoclastic riots took place in Basel (in 1529), Zurich (1523), Copenhagen (1530), Münster (1534), Geneva (1535), Augsburg (1537), Scotland (1559), Rouen (1560) and Saintes and La Rochelle (1562). Calvinist iconoclasm in Europe \"provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs\" in Germany and \"antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox\" in the Baltic region.\n\nThe Seventeen Provinces (now the Netherlands, Belgium and parts of Northern France) were disrupted by widespread Calvinist iconoclasm in the summer of 1566. This is called the \"Beeldenstorm\" and began with the destruction of the statuary of the Monastery of Saint Lawrence in Steenvoorde after a \"Hagenpreek\", or field sermon, by Sebastiaan Matte. Hundreds of other attacks included the sacking of the Monastery of Saint Anthony after a sermon by Jacob de Buysere. The \"Beeldenstorm\" marked the start of the revolution against the Spanish forces and the Catholic Church.\n\nThe iconoclastic belief caused havoc throughout Europe. In 1523, specifically due to the Swiss reformer Huldrych Zwingli, a vast number of his followers viewed themselves as being involved in a spiritual community that in matters of faith should obey neither the visible Church nor lay authorities. According to Peter George Wallace:\n\nDuring the Reformation in England started during the reign of Anglican monarch Henry VIII, and urged on by reformers such as Hugh Latimer and Thomas Cranmer, limited official action was taken against religious images in churches in the late 1530s. Henry's young son, Edward VI, came to the throne in 1547 and, under Cranmer's guidance, issued Injunctions for Religious Reforms in the same year and in 1550, an Act of Parliament \"for the abolition and putting away of divers books and images\". During the English Civil War, Bishop Joseph Hall of Norwich described the events of 1643 when troops and citizens, encouraged by a Parliamentary ordinance against superstition and idolatry, behaved thus:\n\nLord what work was here! What clattering of glasses! What beating down of walls! What tearing up of monuments! What pulling down of seats! What wresting out of irons and brass from the windows! What defacing of arms! What demolishing of curious stonework! What tooting and piping upon organ pipes! And what a hideous triumph in the market-place before all the country, when all the mangled organ pipes, vestments, both copes and surplices, together with the leaden cross which had newly been sawn down from the Green-yard pulpit and the service-books and singing books that could be carried to the fire in the public market-place were heaped together.\n\nProtestant Christianity was not uniformly hostile to the use of religious images. Martin Luther taught the \"importance of images as tools for instruction and aids to devotion\", stating: \"If it is not a sin but good to have the image of Christ in my heart, why should it be a sin to have it in my eyes?\" Lutheran churches retained ornate church interiors with a prominent crucifix, reflecting their high view of the real presence of Christ in Eucharist. As such, \"Lutheran worship became a complex ritual choreography set in a richly furnished church interior.\" For Lutherans, \"the Reformation renewed rather than removed the religious image.\"\n\nWithin Muslim history, the act of removing idols from the Ka'ba in Mecca is considered by all believers to be of great symbolic and historical importance.\n\nIn general, Muslim societies have avoided the depiction of living beings (animals and humans) within such sacred spaces as mosques and madrasahs. This opposition to figural representation is based not on the Qur'an, but on traditions contained within the Hadith. The prohibition of figuration has not always extended to the secular sphere, and a robust tradition of figural representation exists within Muslim art.\nHowever, Western authors have tended to perceive \"a long, culturally determined, and unchanging tradition of violent iconoclastic acts\" within Islamic society.\n\nThe first act of Muslim iconoclasm dates to the beginning of Islam, in 630, when the various statues of Arabian deities housed in the Kaaba in Mecca were destroyed. There is a tradition that Muhammad spared a fresco of Mary and Jesus. This act was intended to bring an end to the idolatry which, in the Muslim view, characterized Jahiliyya.\n\nThe destruction of the idols of Mecca did not, however, determine the treatment of other religious communities living under Muslim rule after the expansion of the caliphate. Most Christians under Muslim rule, for example, continued to produce icons and to decorate their churches as they wished. A major exception to this pattern of tolerance in early Islamic history was the \"Edict of Yazīd\", issued by the Umayyad caliph Yazid II in 722–723.\nThis edict ordered the destruction of crosses and Christian images within the territory of the caliphate. Researchers have discovered evidence that the order was followed, particularly in present-day Jordan, where archaeological evidence shows the removal of images from the mosaic floors of some, although not all, of the churches that stood at this time. But, Yazīd's iconoclastic policies were not continued by his successors, and Christian communities of the Levant continued to make icons without significant interruption from the sixth century to the ninth.\n\nThe missing nose on the Great Sphinx of Giza is attributed to iconoclasm by a Sufi Muslim fanatic in the mid-1300s.\n\nCertain conquering Muslim armies have used local temples or houses of worship as mosques. An example is Hagia Sophia in Istanbul (formerly Constantinople), which was converted into a mosque in 1453. Most icons were desecrated and the rest were covered with plaster. In the 1920s, Hagia Sophia was converted to a museum, and the restoration of the mosaics was undertaken by the American Byzantine Institute beginning in 1932.\n\nMore dramatic cases of iconoclasm by Muslims are found in parts of India where Hindu and Buddhist temples were razed and mosques erected in their place. Aurangzeb destroyed the famous Hindu temples at Varanasi and Mathura, and even went as far as Afghanistan to attempt (unsuccessfully) to destroy the Bamyan Buddhas—a task that was later completed by Islamist Taliban fanatics.\n\nCertain Muslim denominations continue to pursue iconoclastic agendas. There has been much controversy within Islam over the recent and apparently on-going destruction of historic sites by Saudi Arabian authorities, prompted by the fear they could become the subject of \"idolatry\".\n\nA recent act of iconoclasm was the 2001 destruction of the giant Buddhas of Bamyan by the then Taliban government of Afghanistan. The act generated world-wide protests and was not supported by other Muslim governments and organizations. It was widely perceived in the Western media as a result of the Muslim prohibition against figural decoration. Such an account overlooks \"the coexistence between the Buddhas and the Muslim population that marveled at them for over a millennium\" before their destruction. The Buddhas had twice in the past been attacked by Nadir Shah and Aurengzeb. According to the art historian F.B. Flood, analysis of the Taliban's statements regarding the Buddhas suggest that their destruction was motivated more by political than by theological concerns. Taliban spokespeople have given many different explanations of the motives for the destruction.\n\nDuring the Tuareg rebellion of 2012, the radical Islamist militia Ansar Dine destroyed various Sufi shrines from the 15th and 16th centuries in the city of Timbuktu, Mali. In 2016, the International Criminal Court (ICC) sentenced Ahmad al-Faqi al-Mahdi, a former member of Ansar Dine, to nine years in prison for this destruction of cultural world heritage. This was the first time that the ICC convicted a person for such a crime.\n\nThe short-lived Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant carried out iconoclastic attacks such as the destruction of Shia mosques and shrines. Notable incidents include blowing up the Mosque of the Prophet Yunus (Jonah) and destroying the Shrine to Seth in Mosul.\n\n\n\nRevolutions and changes of regime, whether through uprising of the local population, foreign invasion, or a combination of both, are often accompanied by the public destruction of statues and monuments identified with the previous regime. This may also be known as \"damnatio memoriae\", the ancient Roman practice of official obliteration of the memory of a specific individual. Stricter definitions of \"iconoclasm\" exclude both types of action, reserving the term for religious or more widely cultural destruction. In many cases, such as Revolutionary Russia or Ancient Egypt, this distinction can be hard to make.\n\nAmong Roman emperors and other political figures subject to decrees of \"damnatio memoriae\" were Sejanus, Publius Septimius Geta, and Domitian. Several Emperors, such as Domitian and Commodus had during their reigns erected numerous statues of themselves, which were pulled down and destroyed when they were overthrown.\n\nThroughout the radical phase of the French Revolution, iconoclasm was supported by members of the government as well as the citizenry. Numerous monuments, religious works, and other historically significant pieces were destroyed in an attempt to eradicate any memory of the Old Regime. At the same time, the republican government felt responsible to preserve these works for their historical, aesthetic, and cultural value. One way the republican government succeeded in their paradoxical mission of preserving and destroying symbols of the Old Regime was through the development of museums.\n\nDuring the Revolution, a statue of King Louis XV in the Paris square which until then bore his name, was pulled down and destroyed. This was a prelude to the guillotining of his successor Louis XVI in the same site, renamed \"Place de la Révolution\" (at present Place de la Concorde).\n\nThe statue of Napoleon on the column at Place Vendôme, Paris was also the target of iconoclasm several times: destroyed after the Bourbon Restoration, restored by Louis-Philippe, destroyed during the Paris Commune and restored by Adolphe Thiers.\nRecords from the campaign recorded in the \"Chach Nama\" record the destruction of temples during the early eighth century when the Umayyad governor of Damascus, al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, mobilized an expedition of 6000 cavalry under Muhammad bin Qasim in 712.\n\nThe historian Upendra Thakur records the persecution of Hindus and Buddhists:\n\nIn 725 Junayad, the governor of Sind, sent his armies to destroy the second Somnath. In 1024, the temple was again destroyed by Mahmud of Ghazni, who raided the temple from across the Thar Desert. The wooden structure was replaced by Kumarapala (r. 1143–72), who rebuilt the temple out of stone.\n\nSultan Sikandar Butshikan of Kashmir (1389–1413) ordered the breaking of all \"golden and silver images\". Firishta states, \"After the emigration of the Bramins, Sikundur ordered all the temples in Kashmeer to be thrown down. Having broken all the images in Kashmeer, (Sikandar) acquired the title of 'Destroyer of Idols'\".\n\nThere have been a number of anti-Buddhist campaigns in Chinese history that led to the destruction of Buddhist temples and images. One of the most notable of these campaigns was the Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution of the Tang dynasty.\n\nDuring and after the Xinhai Revolution, there was widespread destruction of religious and secular images in China.\n\nDuring the Northern Expedition in Guangxi in 1926, Kuomintang General Bai Chongxi led his troops in destroying Buddhist temples and smashing Buddhist images, turning the temples into schools and Kuomintang party headquarters. It was reported that almost all of the viharas in Guangxi were destroyed and the monks were removed. Bai also led a wave of anti-foreignism in Guangxi, attacking Americans, Europeans, and other foreigners, and generally making the province unsafe for foreigners and missionaries. Westerners fled from the province and some Chinese Christians were also attacked as imperialist agents. The three goals of the movement were anti-foreignism, anti-imperialism and anti-religion. Bai led the anti-religious movement against superstition. Huang Shaohong, also a Kuomintang member of the New Guangxi clique, supported Bai's campaign. The anti-religious campaign was agreed upon by all Guangxi Kuomintang members.\n\nThere was extensive destruction of religious and secular imagery in Tibet after it was invaded and occupied by China.\n\nMany religious and secular images were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution of 1966-1976, ostensibly because they were a holdover from China's traditional and capitalist past (which the Communist regime led by Mao Zedong reviled). The Cultural Revolution included widespread destruction of historic artworks in public places and private collections, whether religious or secular. Objects in state museums were mostly left intact.\n\nDuring and after the October Revolution, widespread destruction of religious and secular imagery took place, as well as the destruction of imagery related to the Imperial family. The Revolution was accompanied by destruction of monuments of past tsars, as well as the destruction of imperial eagles at various locations throughout Russia. According to Christopher Wharton, \"In front of a Moscow cathedral, crowds cheered as the enormous statue of Tsar Alexander III was bound with ropes and gradually beaten to the ground. After a considerable amount of time, the statue was decapitated and its remaining parts were broken into rubble\".\n\nThe Soviet Union actively destroyed religious sites, including Russian Orthodox churches and Jewish cemeteries, in order to discourage religious practice and curb the activities of religious groups.\nDuring the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and during the Revolutions of 1989, protesters often attacked and took down sculptures and images of Joseph Stalin, such as the Stalin Monument in Budapest. The fall of communism in 1989 was also followed by the destruction or removal of statues of Vladimir Lenin and other Communist leaders in the former Soviet Union and in other Eastern Bloc countries. Particularly well-known was the destruction of \"Iron Felix\", the statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky outside the KGB's headquarters. Another statue of Dzerzhinsky was destroyed in a Warsaw square that was named after him during communist rule, but which is now called Bank Square.\n\nOther examples of political destruction of images include:\n\n\n\n"}

Carpeaux entered the École des Beaux-Arts in 1844 and won the Prix de Rome in 1854, and moving to Rome to find inspiration, he there studied the works of Michelangelo, Donatello and Verrocchio. Staying in Rome from 1854 to 1861, he obtained a taste for movement and spontaneity, which he joined with the great principles of baroque art. Carpeaux sought real life subjects in the streets and broke with the classical tradition.\n\nCarpeaux debuted at the Salon in 1853 exhibiting \"La Soumission d'Abd-el-Kader al'Empereur\", a bas-relief in plaster that did not attract much attention. Carpeaux was an admirer of Napoléon III and followed him from city to city during Napoléon's official trip through the north of France. After initially not making any contact with the emperor, he finally succeeded in arranging a face-to-face encounter at Amiens where he managed to convince Napoléon to commission a marble statue that was to be carried out by a practitioner, Charles Romain Capellaro. \n\nCarpeaux soon grew tired of academicism and became a wanderer on the streets of Rome. He spent free time admiring the frescoes of Michelangelo at the Sistine Chapel. Carpeaux said, \"When an artist feels pale and cold, he runs to Michelangelo in order to warm himself, as with the rays of the sun\".\n\nWhile a student in Rome, Carpeaux submitted a plaster version of \"Pêcheur napolitain à la coquille\", the \"Neapolitan Fisherboy\", to the French Academy. He carved the marble version several years later, showing it in the Salon exhibition of 1863. It was purchased for Napoleon III's empress, Eugénie. The statue of the young smiling boy was very popular, and Carpeaux created a number of reproductions and variations in marble and bronze. There is a copy, for instance, in the Samuel H. Kress Collection in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Some years later, he carved the \"Girl with a Shell\", a similar study.\n\nIn 1861, he made a bust of Princess Mathilde, and this later brought him several commissions from Napoleon III. Then in 1866, he established his own atelier in order to reproduce and make work on a grander scale.\nIn 1866, he was awarded the chevalier of the Legion of Honour.\n\nHe employed his brother as the sales manager and made a calculated effort to produce work that would appeal to a larger audience.\nOn 12 October 1875, he died at George Barbu Știrbei's \"château\" in Bécon-les-Bruyères, outside Courbevoie.\n\nAmong his students were Jules Dalou, Jean-Louis Forain and the American sculptor Olin Levi Warner.\n\n\n"}

The son of a cap maker, he attended the Baron Hirsch school and then gymnasium.\n\nAround 1920, he moved to Dresden, Germany, where, in 1925, he co-published a short-lived German-language literary and art magazine, \"Mob: Zeitschrift der Jungen\" (Mob: Journal of youths). He subsequently lived in France, Switzerland, and Austria, before returning to Dresden.\n\nFrom 1929 to 1933, he operated an art gallery in Dresden, called \"Galerie junge Kunst\" (Gallery of young art). After the rise of the National Socialist regime in Germany, he moved to Belgrade (then in Yugoslavia), where he opened another gallery and mounted exhibitions, in 1933-1934.\n\nIn 1935, he moved to Poland; he spent time in Vilna (Vilnius) and Warsaw, and published articles on art in Yiddish-language periodicals, including \"Literarishe bleter\". At the outbreak of the Second World War he fled to the Soviet Union, and survived the war in Kazakhstan, where he taught German in a middle school.\n\nAfter the war, he returned to Poland and settled in Warsaw, in 1946. There he became the leader of the Jewish Society for the Promotion of Fine Arts (Polish: Żydowskie Towarzystwo Krzewienia Sztuk Pięknych; Yiddish: Yidishe gezelshaft tsu farshpreytn kunst), or ZTKSP, a revival of an organization that had been active in Poland before the war. The Society provided material assistance to Jewish artists, helped to promote their work, and fostered art education for Jewish youth. It mounted some 98 exhibitions in Warsaw, and four exhibitions that were presented throughout Poland – two devoted to the work of individual artists, Rafael Mandelzweig, in 1946, and Lea Grundig, in 1949; and two, in 1948, in honor of the fifth anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, featuring works of Jewish artists who were killed in the Holocaust.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the ZTKSP, in September 1949, the art works that Sandel and his colleagues had assembled were integrated into the collections of the Jewish Historical Institute, Warsaw. From 1950 to 1953 the institute operated a Gallery of Jewish Art, with Sandel serving as director.\n\nSandel subsequently devoted himself to the writing of several art historical works concerning Jewish artists in Poland. Among his works, all written in Yiddish, is a two-volume biographical reference work on Jewish artists who perished in the Holocaust, \"Umgekumene yidishe kinstler in Poylen\" (Jewish artists in Poland who perished; Warsaw, 1957).\n\nSandel married Ernestyna Podhorizer (1903-1984), who was also originally from Galicia and worked for a time as the secretary of the ZTKSP. Sandel-Podhorizer was born in Dembits (Dębica), and before the war had been a biology teacher in Lemberg (Lviv); she was later a curator at the museum of the Jewish Historical Institute, and also worked at the Biology Institute in Warsaw.\n\n"}

The organization's mission is to produce and present art that enriches and empowers Asian Pacific American communities. Notable participants include author and Asian American studies scholar Russell Leong, playwright and author Jessica Hagedorn, author Janice Mirikitani, poet and historian Al Robles, and actor and filmmaker Lane Nishikawa. \n\nKearny Street Workshop was founded as an artists' collective in 1972 in the International Hotel (I-Hotel) on San Francisco's Kearny Street. The founders Jim Dong, Lora Joh Foo, and Mike Chin and other early leaders were involved in the Asian American movement, a Civil Rights Movement-inspired period of organizational and community building in the 1970s. The National Endowment for the Arts provided some initial funding through the Neighborhood Arts Program (NAP), an initiative of the San Francisco Arts Commission. Though the founders were initially distrustful of government funds, NAP liaison Bernice Bing and founder Jim Dong eventually agreed to use a $2,000 NAP grant to fund a graphics workshop for KSW participants.\n\nIn its early days, KSW shared space with a dry goods store on the ground floor of the I-Hotel. The organization originally focused on cultivating Chinese American arts and activism. However, the organization quickly expanded to cater to a multiethnic constituency, holding classes for Asian American activists and artists to practice photography, creative writing, and silkscreen printing. Within the first few years, hundreds of Bay-area students were attending classes, salons, workshops, and exhibitions each day. KSW also opened Jackson Street Gallery in an adjacent I-Hotel storefront space in 1974, where Workshop members held exhibitions, poetry readings, and musical performances.\n\nKSW played a key role in developing Asian American activist iconography during the I-Hotel anti-eviction movement. Students and other KSW members painted a block-long mural on the Jackson Street side of the I-Hotel in support of its tenants. Screenprinted posters advocating for the I-Hotel tenants' rights appeared throughout San Francisco's Chinatown, Manilatown, and Japantown during the decade-long fight for the I-Hotel. Artists from KSW also aided in the anti-eviction protests by organizing rallies, attending court hearings, hosting exhibitions on affordable housing, and publishing poetry and pamphlets that depicted life in the I-Hotel. \n\nKSW also provided summer youth programming that was intended to provide a diversion from gang violence in Chinatown. Workshop members also spearheaded the development of the annual Hop Jok Fair, which not only promoted Asian American artwork, but introduced many low-income Chinatown residents to available social and health services. \n\nIn 1977, both residential and business tenants were evicted from the I-Hotel. The workshop's headquarters relocated to a small storefront in North Beach, San Francisco. However, this relocation separated the organization from its key communities and constituents in Chinatown and Manilatown.\n\nKSW was able to return to Chinatown by 1981, leasing a basement space in a hotel on Clay Street. During its time in this space, members organized the Asian American Jazz Festival as well as the Kearny Street Workshop Press.\n\nIn 1995, KSW was incorporated as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization and relocated to South Park, San Francisco. \n\nKSW finally relocated to a gallery and performance space in San Francisco's SoMa in 2006.\n\nKSW's past and present programs include a small poetry press, writers' workshops, visual arts, martial arts, readings, music, gallery exhibitions, performances, and film screenings, as well as the Asian American Jazz Festival and the annual artists festival APAture.\n\nKSW's press published poetry by Bay-area Asian American authors such as Virginia Cerenio, Bob Hsiang, Jaime Jacinto, Genny Lim, Lenny Limjoco, and Jeff Tagami. \n\nKSW founded the Asian American Jazz Festival (AAJF) in 1981, with the help of organizers and KSW members George Leong and Paul Yamazaki. Until it ceased production in 2006, the AAJF was the longest continuously-running jazz festival in the San Francisco area. Notable participants include Mark Izu, Fred Ho, Vijay Iyer, and Jin Hi Kim. \n\nAPAture is an annual multidisciplinary arts festival founded in 2001.

It was founded in May 2001. in Novi Sad (the capital of Vojvodina, major region in Serbia). Organization was founded as an umbrella organization for various non-formal independent art groups, individuals and young artists from Novi Sad. Kulturanova organization focuses its development on urban youth culture and raising awareness on relevant social issues, with the vision of building creative platforms for youth of Novi Sad and region.\n\nAssociation kulturanova formed in 1999. but it was 2001. when the organization officially registered. Basic idea behind the organization was to create an umbrella organization for all young people that were exhausted by the ongoing situation in Serbia during the 1990s. The harsh period of sanctions imposed by the United Nations during the 1990s left most young artists without opportunities to show their work in cultural institutions of the time. To this day Kulturanova worked on projects in the field of arts, theatre, design, graffiti, street culture and cultural politics.\n\nThe basic categories of Kulturanova organization activities are: festivals/events (culture), lectures/conferences (human rights, youth policy) and workshops/seminars (education). Through these basic fields of work, Kulturanova tries to create more open cultural climate. It is done through promoting cultural diversity and tolerant attitude among young people. Also, organization promotes cultural rights as an integral part of human rights. Majority projects are realized through partnerships with many organizations from the region as well as from European Union. Projects developed by the Kulturanova organization during the period 2001–2010 cover the field of arts, theatre, design, graffiti, street culture and cultural politics.\n\n\n\n"}

The school was first located at St. Nicholas of Myra, Christian Orthodox Church, 288 East 10th Street, off Avenue A and near Tompkins Square Park. Tuition was six dollars ($6) per month—or free. Students in the 1920s included Noguchi and Esther Shemitz. \n\nTo foster Noguchi's decision to study sculpture, Ruotolo offered him a job that paid as much as other work he had. Later, Noguchi recalled, \"How could I resist? I became a sculpture even against my will.\" After only three months at the \"Leonardoo\" (as the school was known), Noguchi held a solo exhibition. Ruotolo also helped Noguchi get commissions for outside sculpture work.\n\nIn 1934, the school reorganized and reopened at 149 East 34th Street, graced by \"The New Deal\" mural of Conrad Albrizio. With political and union backing, the school expanded to include the \"Friends of Italian Arts Association,\" eliminating tuition altogether, so that student needed provide only their own art materials. No employees received payment for their services. For the school's rededication, Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia unveiled a fresco symbolic of the New Deal.\n\nContributions diminished significantly during World War II, leading to the Leonardo's closture at its third and final location at 130 East 16th Street on April 28, 1942.\n\nIn addition to starting the career of Noguchi, the Leonardo also was the only school in its time to teach the art of fresco painting.\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was most noted for her role at NBC daytime television programming as the first female vice president of a TV network, a position she held from 1972 until 1976. In this role, Bolen was responsible for commissioning the long-running game show \"Wheel of Fortune\" and is credited with bringing successful long form to network soap operas. Bolen was mentioned in \"Who's Who in America\" as a trailblazer for women in television.\n\nBolen was born in Benton, Illinois. Her father was a United Mine Workers union organizer. Her sister Marilyn Bolen was notable for being the first woman stockbroker to work on the St. Louis exchange floor.\n\nBolen graduated from Benton Consolidated High School. She attended Miss Hickey's School in St. Louis. From 1961 to 1963, she attended City College of New York, where she studied advertising and communications media.\n\nIn 1961, Bolen began her career producing commercials. She then worked on documentaries about Twiggy, and then as a writer and producer of documentary films, which included \"Crisis in America – Welfare \" for ABC-TV and \"Stravinsky's Requiem to Marin Luther King\" with the New York City Ballet.\n\nBolen was appointed Vice President of Daytime Programming at NBC in 1972. In September 1975, she was the first female Vice President of Programming at a TV network and took NBC to #1 in the national Nielsen ratings. She developed an expanded format for \"Days of Our Lives\" and \"Another World\", changing both to an hour-long running time. The expanded shows attracted new viewers and became hits with young women.\n\nAlthough NBC was airing the successful game shows \"Hollywood Squares\", \"Concentration,\" and \"Jeopardy!\" at the time, Bolen's mandate was to increase ratings of young women ages 18–34. Daytime and late-night were seen as NBC's profit center at that time, and advertisers wanted programs that attracted young women. In late 1972, Bolen ended \"Concentration\" 's fifteen-year run and replaced it with the Heatter-Quigley Productions game show \"Baffle\". \"Baffle\" failed to compete with CBS's new game show, \"The $10,000 Pyramid\", and was canceled on March 29, 1974.\n\nBolen also decided to end the eleven-year run of \"Jeopardy!\", feeling that its demographics were old. The show's creator and producer Merv Griffin did not wish to change the show's format, so Bolen commissioned a new game show from Griffin called \"Wheel of Fortune\". Two pilots were produced before the network was satisfied that young women would love the show, although Bolen risked being fired if the show failed. \"Wheel of Fortune\" debuted on January 6, 1975, and was an immediate ratings hit.\n\nIn the spring of 1976, while NBC was still the #1 network in daytime, Bolen left the network to become an independent TV producer. She formed her own production company called Lin Bolen Productions. The new company created and developed game shows, movies of the week, and theatrical films for networks and studios.\n\nBolen created the game show \"Stumpers!\" hosted by Allen Ludden, which was produced exclusively by Bolen's production company. The show was a word game with game elements similar to \"Password\", which had also been hosted by Ludden. The show lasted 13 weeks before being canceled by new NBC president Fred Silverman.\n\nOne series Bolen's company produced for NBC was loosely based on her own career, taking a serious look at the men who ran network television. \"W.E.B.\" was scheduled against ABC's hit series \"Charlie's Angels\" and did not perform well. It was canceled after 13 weeks.\n\nIn 1982, Bolen was hired as head of creative affairs at InterMedia Entertainment, which was owned by Fred Silverman.\n\nBolen's company produced the television movie \"The Christmas Coal Mine Miracle\", starring Kurt Russell and Melissa Gilbert, which became the highest rated movie of the year for NBC. Other films followed, including \"Good Against Evil\" starring Kim Cattrall and Dan O'Herlihy for ABC; \"Golden Gate\" starring Perry King, Melanie Griffith, and John Saxon; A two-hour pilot for ABC called \"Farrell for the People\" starring Valerie Harper and Ed O'Neill; a comedy pilot for NBC called \"The Ann Jillian Show\", and an NBC summer variety pilot called \"Live From the South Seas\" starring John Rowles.\n\nBolen's career as a network executive provided an inspiration in the creation of Faye Dunaway's role as network executive Diana Christiansen in the 1976 satirical film about television, \"Network\". However, in an interview with UPI in 1978, Bolen had said that the \"Network\" character was nothing like her.\n\nAfter leaving NBC, Bolen married director Paul Wendkos in 1984. They remained married until his death on November 12, 2009.\n\nBolen died on January 19, 2018 at a hospital in the San Fernando Valley, and was survived by her son, Jordan Wendkos.\n\n"}

{"id": "14582738", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14582738", "title": "Lone Scherfig", "text": "Lone Scherfig\n\nLone Scherfig (born 2 May 1959) is a Danish film director and screenwriter who has been involved with the Dogme 95 film movement and who has been widely critically acclaimed for several of her movies, including the Oscar-nominated film \"An Education\" (2009). Scherfig's movies are generally romantic comedies, including her film \"One Day\" (2011), based on the David Nicholls novel. Through both experimenting with creative constraints and her astute attention to detail, she has come to be recognized as a blossoming talent in the film industry.\n\nScherfig graduated from the National Film School of Denmark in 1984, and began her career as a director with the television film \"Margrethes elsker\" in 1985. Previously, she had been involved in the advertising business and had won awards (including the Lion d'Argent) at the Cannes International Advertising Film Festival. Her directorial debut in film came with \"Kaj's fodselsdag\". The film was critically successful and garnered her the Grand Jury prize and the Club Espace Award at the Rouen Nordic FIlm Festival. For a period of time following such success, Scherfig wrote and directed a few short films and worked with both radio shows and the stage. In 1998, she directed the film \"Nar mor kommer hjem\", which was the recipient of the Grand Prix at the Montreal Film Festival and the Cinekid Award in Amsterdam.\n\nScherfig found her international breakthrough with the film \"Italian for Beginners\" (2000), which was critically acclaimed and won several awards, including the Jury Grand Prix Silver Bear award at the Berlin International Film Festival. Hailed as a feel-good movie, the film is consistently preoccupied with themes of hope, happiness, and choice. It is credited as the most profitable Scandinavian film to date.\n\nThe film, following the creative constraints of the Dogme 95 movement, is set almost entirely on location within a small space, uses sound only found at the source, and it's shot on video. The film involves several characters and their various romantic or otherwise interactions that unfold across this limited setting. As opposed to many other \"Dogme 95\" films, Scherfig's is rather upbeat and comedic, and has been noted for its rather amusing tone.\n\nFollowing \"Italian for Beginners\", Scherfig made the deadpan comedy \"Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself\", released in 2002. This film, not considered a part of the \"Dogme 95\" canon, is a touching movie centered on a suicidal man who is constantly saved and cared for by his brother. Noted by critics to be a surprisingly lighthearted affair, the movie was praised for Scherfig's ability to craft deep and interesting characters. A.O. Scott mused that the film's tone \"ranges from stoic to diffident to quizzical, at least on the surface. But there is an undercurrent of deep and complicated feeling beneath the Scottish reserve; it is signalled by the music, and by Ms. Scherfig's exquisite sense of nuance.\" This film found Scherfig working closely with the prolific writer Anders Thomas Jensen in developing a screenplay. It also allowed her to align her work with the production companies Sigma Films and Zentropa. Although well received, \"Wilbur\" was not as commercially successful as \"Italian for Beginners\", although it did act as a catalyst for a \"Dogme 95\" related project called the \"Advance Party,\" in which both Scherfig and Jensen helped write characters for Lars Von Trier.\n\nAs with \"Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself\", Scherfig wrote and directed another character focused film: \"Just Like Home\", released in 2007. In this comedic endeavour, set in a little town, several characters unite to discover who could be causing commotion in the streets at night. The movie concerns itself primarily with the various citizens of the town and their interactions with each other. In the style of constraints learned by being involved in the \"Dogme 95\", Scherfig claims that the film was written piece by piece every day it was shot. Further proving Scherfig's fascination with lighthearted and sweet affairs, she has claimed the story is \"about trust...the fundamental belief that people you hardly know will want the best for you.\" The film received very little commercial or critical spotlight, instead acting as a bridge between Scherfig's earlier experiments and her more American successes.\n\nIn 2009, \"An Education\", Scherfig's most critically lauded film, was released. Written by esteemed fiction author Nick Hornby, the movie was based on journalist Lynn Barber's experiences as a teenager in post-war Britain. The film's story follows 16-year-old Jenny (played by Carey Mulligan) as she is picked up one rainy night by David (played by Peter Sarsgaard), and brought into the bustling and exciting London society. Centered on this tender and somewhat morally ambiguous romantic relationship between David and Jenny, the movie was hailed as being subtle and deliberate in its pacing and tone. Many reviewers noted the exceptional performance of Carey Mulligan as the protagonist. She went on to gain a nomination from the Academy Awards, as did the film itself (for Best Picture) and Nick Hornby (for his Adapted Screenplay). On making the film, Scherfig has talked about her focus on the theme of being an American teenager examined throughout the story, saying, \"my guess is about America is that it’s this combination of innocence and freedom that attracts you. Here in Denmark, as well, it was more liberated than it is now, and was definitely more innocent and less dangerous. I mean, when I was a teenager, the world was a lot safer than it is now for my daughter as a teenager, which meant that I could have a lot more fun. It wasn’t risky the way it is now.\" She has also discussed the pleasures of working in a more collaborative spirit for this movie, commenting that the movie was \"the same piece that we [were] all working on, and that was really important to me as a director that everyone was making the same film, that everyone contributed to the package and tried to strengthen it and get as many facets as possible but not be over-inventive, [to] just tell the story as well as we possibly could.\" Coming off the success of \"An Education\", Scherfig had many opportunities to develop a more expansive American career in filmmaking.\n\nScherfig's next film titled \"One Day\", released in 2011, follows the lives of two romantically engaged individuals as they intersect one day each year. Based on a novel and then adapted by David Nicholls, the movie marks a more obvious turning point for Scherfig's career in reaching a mildly larger audience than any of her previous films. The plot and story of the movie has been commented on being somewhat simple and predictable, but critics were also aware of Scherfig's ability to give the dialogue and tone of the film a distinct freshness. Leading actors Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess both lent the film access to a wider audience. Scherfig herself had stated expressly her interest in working with Hathaway on this project. She has also commented on the difficulties of working with someone else's screenplay, saying in an interview that:\n\nUltimately, the film was a moderate success commercially, grossing over $56 million worldwide on a $15 million budget. It also furthered Scherfig's career and her capacity to reach a broader audience.\n\nScherfig worked as a consultant writer for the Danish film \"Alting\", and has worked on other projects (such as \"Red Road\" and \"Donkeys\") in helping write and develop characters. Her most recent work is \"The Riot Club\", based on the stage play \"Posh\" by Laura Wade, released in 2014. The film follows two first-year students amongst the privileged elite of Oxford University, determined to join the infamous Riot Club, where reputations can be made or destroyed over the course of a single evening. Universal Pictures distributed the film in the UK and Ireland.\n\n\"Kaj's fodselsdag\" won both the Club Espace Award and the Grand Jury Prize at the Rouen Nordic Film Festival in 1991. \"Nar mor kommer hjem\" won the Cinekid Film Award in 1998.\n\nAt the Berlin International Film Festival, \"Italian for Beginners\" won the FIPRESCI Prize, the Prize of Ecumenical Jury, the Reader Jury of the \"Berliner Morgenpost,\" and the Silver Berlin Bear, and was nominated for the Golden Berlin Bear. It was also nominated for a Bodil (as was \"Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself\" and \"An Education\"). \"Italian for Beginners\" was nominated at the Chicago International Film Festival, the European Film Awards, the Goya Awards, and picked up awards at Bordeaux International Festival of Women in Cinema, the Festróia-Tróia International Film Festival, the Flaiano Film Festival, the Hamptons International Film Festival, the Paris Film Festival, the Robert Festival, the Valladolid Film Festival, and the Warsaw International Film Festival.\n\n\"Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself\" garnered nominations from the British Independent Film Awards, the Chlotudis Awards, the Robert Festival, the Valladolid Film Festival, and came in second place at the Emden International Film Festival. It took home awards at the Festróia-Tróia International Film Festival, the Hamptons International Film Festival, the Skip City International D-Cinema Festival, the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival, and the Victoria Independent Film & Video Festival in Canada.\n\nAlthough \"Just Like Home\" was shunned by critics, Scherfig's fourth film was offered the most recognition. \"An Education\" was nominated at the BAFTA Awards, the British Independent Film Awards, the European Film Awards, the Film Critics Circle of Australia Awards, the Satellite Awards, and the Academy Awards. It won various awards at the Chicago International Film Festival, the Independent Spirit Awards, the Mill Valley Film Festival, the Robert Festival, and the Sundance Film Festival.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "58429775", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58429775", "title": "Lusona", "text": "Lusona\n\nSona (sing. Lusona) drawing is an ideographic tradition known across eastern Angola, northwestern Zambia and adjacent areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and is mainly practiced by the Chokwe and Luchazi people. These ideographs function as mnemonic devices to record proverbs, fables, games, riddles and animals, and to transmit knowledge.\n\nAccording to ethnologist Gerhard Kubik, this tradition must be ancient and certainly pre-colonial, as observers independently collected the same ideographs among peoples separated for generations. Additionally, early petroglyphs from the Upper Zambezi area in Angola and Citundu-Hulu in the Moçâmedes Desert exhibit structural similarities with lusona ideographs. Those petroglyphs date from a period between the 6th century BC and the 1st-century BC.\n\nSona ideographs are sometimes used as murals, and most of the time executed in the sand. To make them, drawing experts — after cleaning and smoothing the ground — would impress equidistant dots and draw a continuous line between them. The dots can represent trees, persons or animals, while the lines can represent paths, rivers, fences, walls, contours of a body, etc.\n\nThe mathematical ideas exhibited by those ideographs are transformational geometry, abstract algebra and linear algebra. 80% are symmetric and 60% are mono-linear. They are an example of the use of a coordinate system and geometric algorithms.\n\nSona drawings can be classified by the algorithms used for their construction. Paulus Gerdes identified six algorithms, most commonly the \"plaited-mat\" algorithm, which seems to have been inspired by mat weaving.\n\nVarious studies suggest that the drawing experts knew specific rules of \"chaining\" and \"elimination\" relating to the systematic construction of monolinear figures. Studies suggest that the \"drawing experts\" who invented these rules knew why they were valid, and could prove in one way or another the validity of the theorems that these rules express.\n\nIt is difficult to find accounts of theorems developed by the drawing experts to generalize specific patterns relating to dimension and monolinearity/polylinearity, as this tradition was secret and in extinction when it started to be recorded.\n\nHowever, the drawing experts possibly knew that rectangles with relatively prime dimensions give one-line drawings. This idea is supported by the fact that of the 30 smallest relatively prime rectangular shapes, 75% appears among the documented drawings. It is further possible that they knew that if a square of a dot is added to a one-line lusona, the lusona would still be mono-linear. It seems clear that they had experimentally discovered this fact for 2 X 2 squares.\n\n"}

Living in poverty with her husband in a small house in Marshalltown, Nova Scotia, most of her life, she achieved national recognition in 1964 and 1965. Several books, plays and films have since been produced about her. Lewis remains one of Canada's best-known folk artists. Her works and the restored Maud Lewis House are displayed in the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia.\n\nLewis was born Maud Kathleen Dowley on March 7, 1903 in South Ohio, Nova Scotia, the daughter of John and Agnes (Germain) Dowley. She had one brother. Dowley suffered from juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, which reduced her mobility, especially in her hands. Dowley was introduced to art by her mother, who instructed her in the making of watercolour Christmas cards to sell. She began her artistic career by selling hand-drawn and painted Christmas cards. \n\nMaud became involved with Emery Allen, also of Digby, who has been described as the love of her life. She gave birth to their daughter, Catherine Dowley, in 1928 out of wedlock. Allen abandoned Dowley and their daughter. Maud continued to live at home with her parents. It was arranged by the court for her daughter Catherine to be adopted, as Dowley had no way to support her. Later in life Catherine married Paul Muise and had her own family; they lived in Nova Scotia and Ontario. She apparently tried to contact her mother, but was not successful.\n\nIn 1935, her father John died and in 1937, her mother Agnes died. As was typical of the time, her brother inherited the family home. After living with her brother for a short while, Dowley moved to Digby, Nova Scotia to live with her aunt.\n\nWhen Dowley was 34, she married Everett Lewis, a fish peddler from Marshalltown, on January 16, 1938. He also worked as the watchman at the county Poor Farm. According to Everett, Maud Dowley showed up at his door step in response to an advertisement he had posted in the local stores for a \"live-in or keep house\" for a forty-year-old bachelor. Several weeks later, they married. \n\nThey lived in Everett's one-room house with a sleeping loft in Marshalltown, a few miles west of Digby. Maud used this house as her studio. Everett took care of the housework. Lewis and her husband lived mostly in poverty in the one-room house. After their deaths, the house was purchased by a local group. It was acquired by the province and transferred to the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia in Halifax. They had the tiny house restored and it is now part of a permanent display on Maud Lewis and her works.\n\nMaud Lewis accompanied her husband on his daily rounds peddling fish door-to-door, bringing along Christmas cards that she had drawn. She would sell the cards for twenty-five cents each. These cards proved popular with her husband's customers, and she began painting. Everett encouraged Lewis to paint, and he bought her her first set of oils.\n\nShe expanded her range, using other surfaces for painting, such as pulp boards (beaverboards), cookie sheets, and Masonite. Lewis was a prolific artist and also painted on more or less every available surface in their tiny home: walls, doors, breadboxes, and even the stove. She completely covered the simple patterned commercial wallpaper with sinewy stems, leaves, and blossoms.\n\nMaud Lewis used bright colours in her paintings, and subjects were often flowers or animals, including oxen teams, horses, birds, deer, or cats. Many of her paintings are of outdoor scenes, including Cape Island boats bobbing on the water, horses pulling a sleigh, skaters, and portraits of dogs, cats, deer, birds, and cows. Her paintings were inspired by childhood memories of the landscape and people around Yarmouth and South Ohio, as well as Digby locations, such as Point Prim and Bayview. Commercial Christmas cards and calendars also influenced her. \n\nMost of her paintings are quite small - often no larger than eight by ten inches, although she is known to have done at least five paintings 24 inches by 36 inches. The size was limited by the extent she could move her arms, which had been affected by arthritis. She used mostly wallboard and tubes of Tinsol, an oil-based paint. Lewis' technique consisted of first coating the board with white, then drawing an outline, and applying paint directly out of the tube. She never blended or mixed colours.\n\nEarly Maud Lewis paintings from the 1940s are quite rare. A large collection of Lewis' work can be found in the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia (AGNS). The AGNS occasionally displays the Chaplin/Wennerstrom shutters (now part of the Clearwater Fine Foods Inc. collection). This collection comprises twenty-two exterior house shutters that Lewis painted in the early 1940s. The work was done for some Americans who owned a cottage on the South Shore. Most of the shutters are quite large, at 5 ft x 1 ft.6 inches. Lewis was paid 70 cents a shutter.\n\nBetween 1945 and 1950, people began to stop at Lewis' Marshalltown home on Highway No. 1, the main highway and tourist route in western Nova Scotia. They bought her paintings for two or three dollars each. Only in the last three or four years of Lewis' life did her paintings begin to sell for seven to ten dollars. She achieved national attention as a folk artist following an article in the Toronto-based \"Star Weekly\" in 1964. In 1965, she was featured on CBC-TV's \"Telescope\". Two of Lewis' paintings were ordered by the White House in the 1970s during Richard Nixon's presidency. But, her arthritis limited her ability to complete many of the orders that had come from her national recognition. \n\nIn the early 21st century, her paintings have sold at auction for ever increasing prices. Two of her paintings have sold for more than $16,000. The highest auction price so far is $22,200.00 for lot 196 \"A Family Outing\". The painting was sold at a Bonham's auction in Toronto on November 30, 2009. Another painting, \"A View of Sandy Cove\", sold in 2012 for $20,400. A painting found in 2016 at an Ontario thrift store, \"Portrait of Eddie Barnes and Ed Murphy, Lobster Fishermen\", sold at auction for almost three times its estimated price.

It is a form of parallel projection, in which all the projection lines are orthogonal to the projection plane, resulting in every plane of the scene appearing in affine transformation on the viewing surface. The obverse of an orthographic projection is an oblique projection, which is a parallel projection in which the projection lines are \"not\" orthogonal to the projection plane.\n\nThe term \"orthographic\" is sometimes reserved specifically for depictions of objects where the principal axes or planes of the object are also parallel with the projection plane, but these are better known as \"multiview projections\". Furthermore, when the principal planes or axes of an object in an orthographic projection are \"not\" parallel with the projection plane, but are rather tilted to reveal multiple sides of the object, the projection is called an \"axonometric projection\". Sub-types of \"multiview projection\" include \"plans\", \"elevations\" and \"sections\". Sub-types of \"axonometric projection\" include \"isometric\", \"dimetric\" and \"trimetric projections\".\n\nA lens providing an orthographic projection is known as an object-space telecentric lens.\n\nA simple orthographic projection onto the plane \"z\" = 0 can be defined by the following matrix:\n\nFor each point \"v\" = (\"v\", \"v\", \"v\"), the transformed point would be\n\nOften, it is more useful to use homogeneous coordinates. The transformation above can be represented for homogeneous coordinates as \n\nFor each homogeneous vector \"v\" = (\"v\", \"v\", \"v\", 1), the transformed vector would be\n\nIn computer graphics, one of the most common matrices used for orthographic projection can be defined by a 6-tuple, (\"left\", \"right\", \"bottom\", \"top\", \"near\", \"far\"), which defines the clipping planes. These planes form a box with the minimum corner at (\"left\", \"bottom\", -\"near\") and the maximum corner at (\"right\", \"top\", -\"far\").\n\nThe box is translated so that its center is at the origin, then it is scaled to the unit cube which is defined by having a minimum corner at (-1,-1,-1) and a maximum corner at (1,1,1).\n\nThe orthographic transform can be given by the following matrix:\nwhich can be given as a scaling followed by a translation of the form\n\nThe inversion of the Projection Matrix, which can be used as the Unprojection Matrix is defined:\n\nformula_7\n\nWith \"multiview projections\", up to six pictures of an object are produced, with each projection plane parallel to one of the coordinate axes of the object. The views are positioned relative to each other according to either of two schemes: \"first-angle\" or \"third-angle\" projection. In each, the appearances of views may be thought of as being \"projected\" onto planes that form a six-sided box around the object. Although six different sides can be drawn, usually three views of a drawing give enough information to make a three-dimensional object. These views are known as \"front view\", \"top view\" and \"end view\". Other names for these views include \"plan\", \"elevation\" and \"section\".\n\nThe term \"axonometric projection\" (not to be confused with the related \"principle of axonometry\", as described in Pohlke's theorem) is used to describe the type of orthographic projection where the plane or axis of the object depicted is \"not\" parallel to the projection plane, and where multiple sides of an object are visible in the same image. It is further subdivided into three groups: \"isometric\", \"dimetric\" and \"trimetric projection\", depending on the exact angle at which the view deviates from the orthogonal. A typical characteristic of axonometric projection (and other pictorials) is that one axis of space is usually displayed as vertical.\n\nAn orthographic projection map is a map projection of cartography. Like the stereographic projection and gnomonic projection, orthographic projection is a perspective (or azimuthal) projection, in which the sphere is projected onto a tangent plane or secant plane. The \"point of perspective\" for the orthographic projection is at infinite distance. It depicts a hemisphere of the globe as it appears from outer space, where the horizon is a great circle. The shapes and areas are distorted, particularly near the edges.\n\nThe orthographic projection has been known since antiquity, with its cartographic uses being well documented. Hipparchus used the projection in the 2nd century BC to determine the places of star-rise and star-set. In about 14 BC, Roman engineer Marcus Vitruvius Pollio used the projection to construct sundials and to compute sun positions.\n\nVitruvius also seems to have devised the term orthographic (from the Greek \"orthos\" (= “straight”) and graphē (= “drawing”) for the projection. However, the name \"analemma\", which also meant a sundial showing latitude and longitude, was the common name until François d'Aguilon of Antwerp promoted its present name in 1613.\n\nThe earliest surviving maps on the projection appear as woodcut drawings of terrestrial globes of 1509 (anonymous), 1533 and 1551 (Johannes Schöner), and 1524 and 1551 (Apian).\n\n"}

In his thesis, he argues that inventions are not the result of a rigorous scientific method but rather come as a deterministic consequence of a set of conditions in which the inventor lives. This theory was contested very soon after its publication in the 1882 edition of the \"Revue Internationale de l'Enseignement\". Also in 1882 his wife gave birth to Étienne Souriau, who also became a philosopher in aesthetics. The French thesis was created simultaneously with a Latin thesis titled \"De motus perceptione\". The Latin thesis emphasized the importance of vision in movement perception, hence the initial title \"De visione motus\". The thesis was a precursor for his later works on movement perception.\n\nHe became a professor at the Faculté des Lettres de Lille (now University of Lille) very soon after its foundation in 1887. In 1889, he published his reflections on the aesthetics of movement. The book described two levels of movement aesthetics: the mechanical beauty (the adaptation of the movement to fulfil its goal) and the movement expression (the meaning of the movement for an observer). By doing so Souriau distinguished movement from perception of movement, two concepts which later became the subjects of studies of motor cognition and psychophysics.\n\nThroughout his career, but more particularly during the first decade of the 20th century, he published his reflections on the aesthetics of arts while being a professor at Henri Poincaré University (Nancy).

{"id": "753771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=753771", "title": "Photogravure", "text": "Photogravure\n\nPhotogravure is an intaglio printmaking or photo-mechanical process whereby a copper plate is grained (adding a pattern to the plate) and then coated with a light-sensitive gelatin tissue which had been exposed to a film positive, and then etched, resulting in a high quality intaglio plate that can reproduce detailed continuous tones of a photograph.\n\nThe earliest forms of photogravure were developed by two original pioneers of photography itself, first Nicéphore Niépce in France in the 1820s, and later Henry Fox Talbot in England. Niépce was seeking a means to create photographic images on plates that could then be etched and used to make prints on paper with a traditional printing press. Niépce's early images were among the first photographs, pre-dating daguerreotypes and the later wet collodion photographic process. Talbot, inventor of the calotype paper negative process, wanted to make paper prints that would not fade. He worked on his photomechanical process in the 1850s and patented it in 1852 ('photographic engraving') and 1858 ('photoglyphic engraving').\n\nPhotogravure in its mature form was developed in 1878 by Czech painter Karel Klíč, who built on Talbot's research. This process, the one still in use today, is called the Talbot-Klič process.\n\nBecause of its high quality and richness, photogravure was used for both original fine art prints and for photo-reproduction of works from other media such as paintings. Photogravure is distinguished from rotogravure in that photogravure uses a flat copper plate etched rather deeply and printed by hand, while in rotogravure, as the name implies, a rotary cylinder is only lightly etched, and it is a factory printing process for newspapers, magazines, and packaging. In France the correct term for photogravure is \"héliogravure\", while the French term \"photogravure\" refers to any photo-based etching technique.\n\nPhotogravure registers a wide variety of tones, through the transfer of etching ink from an etched copper plate to special dampened paper run through an etching press. The unique tonal range comes from photogravure's variable depth of etch, that is, the shadows are etched many times deeper than the highlights. Unlike half-tone processes which vary the size of dot, the depth of ink wells is varied in a photogravure plate. The human eye resolves these fine variations into a continuous tone image. Photogravure practitioners such as Peter Henry Emerson and others brought the art to a high standard in the late 19th century. This continued with the work of Alfred Stieglitz in the early 20th century, especially in relation to his publication Camera Work. This publication also featured the photogravures of Alvin Langdon Coburn who was a fine gravure printer and envisioned his photographic work as gravures rather than other photo-based processes. The speed and convenience of silver-gelatin photography eventually displaced photogravure which fell into disuse after the Edward S. Curtis gravures in the 1920s. One of the last major portfolios of fine art photogravures was Paul Strand's \"Photographs from Mexico\" from 1940, reissued as \"The Mexican Portfolio\" in 1967 by DeCapo Press. Many years later, photogravure has experienced a revival in the hands of Aperture and Jon Goodman, who studied it in Europe. Photogravure is now actively practiced in several dozen workshops around the world.\n\nPhotogravure plates go through several distinct stages:\n\n\nPrinting a photogravure is similar to printing any other intaglio plate, especially a finely etched aquatint. A stiff, oily intaglio printing ink is applied to the whole surface of the plate with a rubber brayer, or a small, stiff squeegee, or a rolled tamper. The plate is then gently wiped with tarlatans to remove the excess ink and drive it into the recesses (wells). It is finally wiped with the fatty part of the palm of the hand in quick glancing strokes. This removes all remaining ink from the polished highlights and high points and leaves ink only in the etched recesses. After the edges are cleaned, the plate is placed on the printing bed of an intaglio press. It is covered with a sheet of dampened rag paper and then two to three layers of thin wool blankets. It is then run through the press at high pressure. The high pressure pushes the fibers of the dampened paper into the wells of the plate which then transfers the ink onto the paper thereby creating the impression. The paper is carefully peeled off the plate and placed between blotters and weighted so it will dry flat. The plate can now be re-inked for another impression or it can be cleaned for storage.\n\nMacdermid Autotype, the last manufacturer of the gelatin pigment paper (tissue) needed to make traditional copper plate photogravure, announced the end of their production in August 2009. Since then, other manufacturers, including Bostick & Sullivan, Phoenix Gravure, and others in India, Taiwan, and Japan have begun supplying gelatin pigment paper (resist tissue) to the market. These products are used by practitioners of traditional photogravure etching and by commercial printers.\n\nDonald Farnsworth at the art workshop Magnolia Editions developed a digital direct-to-plate photogravure process that does not use gelatin. Instead, a series of 'masks' (layers of resist) are printed onto a copper plate using a flatbed UV cured acrylic printer: “The flatbed printer allows us to etch a stochastic [random] dot pattern into the plate in a completely controlled, precise way... This process is an inversion of the traditional photogravure method, where you’re etching through a sheet of gelatin, and gradually the gelatin is getting thinner and more acid reaches the plate, so the last thing that’s etched are the light tones.” Instead, the digital direct-to-plate method requires that the light values be etched first; then the printer is used to lay down a new layer of ink onto the plate between acid baths, masking out the lighter values to protect them from subsequent etches. The initial mask looks like it has barely been printed; the masks grow in density until the plate eventually appears almost completely black.\n\nIn another variation of the traditional process, where the acid baths are increasingly watered down as the process unfolds, the direct-to-plate process begins with a weak bath and is gradually etched in baths which are increasingly acidic.\n\nPhotopolymer plates, usually used for relief and letterpress printing, can be used to make photogravure plates. These polymer plates, when developed, are a hard plastic, which allows for fewer impressions to be made. Some feel that they rival the quality of traditional copper plate photogravure, while others find that the lack of differential depth in the polymer coating compromises quality.\n\nThe process involves a series of exposures of the polymer plate. First, it is exposed under strong light with a random dot screen placed on top of it (called an aquatint screen in fine art printing or a stochastic screen in commercial printing). Next, the plate is exposed to a positive transparency of an image. This transparency can be a continuous tone positive on film, but is most often made as a digital 'positive' (made in the same way as a digital negative) printed with an inkjet printer. The plate is then developed; for most types and brands of plates, this is done in water.\n\nAfter proper drying and curing, the plate can be inked and printed. The dual exposures produce an \"etched\" polymer plate with many thousands of indentations of varying depth which hold ink, which in turn are transferred as a continuous tone image to a sheet of paper. Depending on the quality, the resulting print may look similar to or the same as those produced with the traditional photogravure process, though without the same amount of three-dimensional depth on the surface of the plate, and arguably, the print itself.\n\nTwo polymer plates commonly in use are Printight plates made by the Toyobo Corporation and Solarplates.\n\n\n"}

Introduced in \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" (1974), after a series of grave robberies, Hardesty, her paraplegic brother Franklin, and their friends travel across Texas to investigate upon hearing reports that her grandfather's grave may have been vandalized. She subsequently appears in the sequel \"\" (1994) as a patient on a gurney. \n\nIn the 2003 film, Hardesty is forced to face Leatherface and his cannibalistic family after picking up a distraught hitchhiker who kills herself. Originally, the remake was intended to be told in flashback format from the perspective of an aged Hardesty, with Burns set to reprise her iconic role. The plot would have revolved around the aftermath of Sally's escape with her reporting her traumatizing experience with Leatherface to the authorities. \n\nIn academic materials, Hardesty has been regarded as one of the earliest examples of the final girl trope. Outside of film, Hardesty is featured in merchandise based on the films, is referenced in the video game \"Dead by Daylight\" (2017), and has a main role in the \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" novelization of the 2003 film.\n\nIn \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\", Sally and her paraplegic brother, Franklin, travel with three friends - Jerry, Kirk, and Pam - to visit the grave of the Hardesty's grandfather after reports of grave robbing in the area. Afterwards, they decide to visit the old Hardesty family homestead. Along the way, they pick up a hitchhiker. He borrows Franklin's pocket-knife and cuts himself, then takes a Polaroid picture of the others and demands money for it. When they refuse to pay, he burns the photo and slashes Franklin's arm with a straight razor. The group forces him out of the van and drive on. They stop at a gas station to refuel, but the proprietor tells them that the pumps are empty. They continue toward the homestead, planning to return to the gas station on the way back when it has received fuel delivery. When they arrive, Kirk and Pam find a swimming-hole dried up but hear a generator running. They stumble upon a nearby house. Later, Leatherface appears and kills Franklin with a chainsaw and Sally runs to the old house. She runs upstairs and finds the desiccated bodies of an old couple. She jumps out of the second story window to escape Leatherface and runs to the gas station. \n\nThe proprietor ties Sally up, gags her and forces her into the back of his truck and drives to the house. Sally is tied to a chair at a dinner table and Leatherface and the hitchhiker bring the desiccated body of the old man downstairs. They decide that he should be the one who should kill her. After several failed attempts of the old man trying to hit Sally with a hammer, she manages to escape and jump through the window and flee. She reaches the road and a semi-truck stops to help her but Leatherface attacks the driver. She jumps into the back of a pickup truck that stops to help her, escaping Leatherface.\n\nAlthough she does not physically appear in the sequel \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2\" (1986), Sally's aftermath from the first film is mentioned in the introduction. The narrator states that Sally described her traumatic encounter with Leatherface and his family as feeling like she had \"broken out of a window in hell\", and it is revealed that she had went into catatonia after her revealing her ordeal to the police. This film identifies her as Sally Hardesty-Enright. In the intro speech for \"\", the narrator states that Sally eventually died in a private health care facility in 1977. In \"\" (1994), Sally is briefly shown being wheeled through a hospital on a gurney while still in a coma. Marilyn Burns reprises her role for this film. Sally appears in a flashback scene in the 2013 film \"Texas Chainsaw 3D\", which serves as a direct sequel to the 1974 film.\n\nIn 2017, Fright-Rags released a T-shirt with Sally and Leatherface being a main part of the design. Although not playable, Hardesty is referenced in the video game \"Dead by Daylight\". She appears in the 2016 fan film \"Sally's Escape from Hell\".\n\nWhile studying at the University of Texas at Austin, Burns auditioned for the role of Sally when a casting call was held for \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" (1974). Burns previously met Hooper when he was kicked off the set of Sidney Lumet's drama film \"Lovin' Molly\" (1974), in which Burns worked as a stand-in for Susan Sarandon and Blythe Danner. Burns did most of her own stunts during filming such as jumping through the window during the ending and during the dinner scene, her finger was actually cut by a real knife with no fake blood being used. Originally, the 2003 remake was intended to be told in flashback format with an aged Sally recounting her experience with Leatherface to authorities. Burns was set to reprise her role. Ultimately, this version of the film was scrapped.\n\nIn \"Shocking Cinema of the Seventies\", Xavier Mendik says that \"Blonde Sally survives, and she's still intact. Bruised and cut, but still intact. Her hair is matted and dirty now, her tight vest is torn, her hip-hugging jeans no so white, but she's still alive. Whether this is a good thing, she does not yet know. For now, tied up, face to face with maniacs she thought she'd never see again (Hitchhiker: \"I thought you was in a hurry?!\"), it is all too much. Her eyes go wide before she blacks out. And then she wakes, from one nightmare into another.\" \n\nIn \"Making and Remaking Horror in the 1970s and 2000s: Why Don’t They Do It Like They Used To?\", David Roche contrasts Sally to Laurie Strode from the \"Halloween\" series stating, \"All in all, Sally Hardesty and Laurie Strode have very little in common, apart from the fact that both characters survive the horror they have witnessed\" and goes on to say that \"Sally, the hippie, is very \"feminine\" and not especially heroic: she undergoes intense suffering, attempts to sell her body, and seems to lose her mind. Sally is, in effect, the most resisting body. As such, the character of Sally simultaneously enables the Family to attempt to assert its masculinity in the face of the abject female and contributes to the discovery of the instability of sexist patriarchal values by bearing witness to the way the Family's mimicry of patriarchy reveals its constructiveness; these two functions coalesce in the shots of Sally's eyes. I would, thus, argue that the character of Sally by no means represents a feminist development, but her resilience does enable an anti-essentialist subtext to emerge to some extent.\" However, James Rose believes that Sally and Laurie have a lot of similarities, stating:\n\nHe goes on to state the difference between the two:\n\nEditor Stefano Lo Verme compared Burns's performance as Sally to the performances of Sandra Peabody as Mari Collingwood in \"The Last House on the Left\" (1972) and Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode in \"Halloween\" (1978).\n"}

It has had university status since 1970.\n\nThe predecessor of the \"Angewandte\" was founded in 1863 as the \"k. k. Kunstgewerbeschule\" (Vienna School of Arts and Crafts), following the example of the South Kensington Museum in London, now the Victoria & Albert Museum, to set up a place of advanced education for designers and craftsmen with the Arts and Crafts School in Vienna. It was closely associated with the \"Österreichischen Museums für Kunst und Industrie\" (Imperial Royal Austrian Museum of Art and Industry, today known as the MAK). \n\nIt was the first school of its kind on the continent. In 1941 it became an institution of higher education. 1941-45 it was called \"Reichshochschule fuer angewandte Kunst\", and in 1948 was taken over by the Austrian state as an academy. In 1970 it was awarded the title of a university and in 1998 it was renamed the \"Universität für angewandte Künste\" (\"University of applied arts\").\n\nFamous artists such as Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka, Koloman Moser, Vivienne Westwood, Karl Lagerfeld,Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, Jil Sander, Pipilotti Rist, Matteo Thun, François Valentiny, Hugo Markl and Stefan Sagmeister were part of the university's staff or student body. Today its faculty includes many distinguished artists and teachers, such as Judith Eisler, Erwin Wurm, Hartmut Esslinger, Greg Lynn, Wolf D Prix (of Coop Himmelb(l)au), Peter Weibel and the philosopher Burghart Schmidt.\n\nThe university has currently ca. 1,800 students and c. 380 faculty. The students come from 70 different countries to study in the 29 disciplines of the school, structured in 60% Austrians, 25% Europeans and 15% from other countries.

The company filed for bankruptcy in 2009. \nPaul Wyler was born in 1896. Wyler presented its first 16 and 19-line precision movements to the public in 1923. The particularity of these was the Incaflex balance wheel, which was legendary at the time. The Wyler Incaflex balance wheel is protected along its diameter by two curved, elastic arms, which absorb any shocks to the balance wheel. In addition to producing his own calibres, Wyler also modified movements of other large-scale producers and sold these on to other watch companies. In some cases, the basic calibre was changed so much that the movements should actually be considered as Wyler calibres.\n\nIn 1934, Wyler was the official watch of Italy's World Cup winning team.\n\nIn 1937 the company caused a stir by launching a water-resistant watch that was not fitted with the conventional soft gaskets. The mineral glass was pressed in between the edge of the case and a pressed or screwed bezel, the gap between the winding shaft and the watch case was sealed hydraulically by fitting the winding shaft and bushing together, in the same material, to 1/500 mm.\n\nWyler gained worldwide notoriety with a spectacular marketing stunt in 1956, when two watches were dropped from the top of the Eiffel Tower and continued to function after the fall.\n\nIn 1960 manual and self-winding models from the Incaflex range became the official railway watch of the Santa Fe Railroad. In 1972, the Wyler Watch Corp. New York became a distributor for Eterna.\n\nThe brand was reborn as \"Wyler Genève\" at Baselworld 2006, following a decision by the Binda Group to reposition it.\n\nAt Baselworld 2007, the Wyler Genève Chronograph and tourbillons were presented, and in autumn 2007 the Wyler-Zagato watch was launched in conjunction with the Italian Atelier Zagato. The watch has an 8-day manual-winding manufacture movement.\n"}
