In 1902, with Jacques-Émile Blanche as director of the academy, the concept had been 'any attempt at \"imitation\" are now abandoned' [toute tentative d'imitation étant désormais abandonnée]. From 1912, when Henri Le Fauconnier and Jean Metzinger took over the direction of the school, the role of the \"Académie de La Palette\" as the nexus for the avant-garde at the forefront of the Parisian art scene was secured.\n\nFrom 1900 to 1914 many academies were formed in Paris under the direction of well-known established artists, such as the Académie Matisse, Académie Alexander Archipenko, Académie de la Grande Chaumière, Académie Humbert, Académie Ranson, Académie Russe de Peinture et de Sculpture, Académie Vasilieff, and Académie Vitti. These schools had for competition not only each other but those already established academies that had become popular prior to the 1900s such as \"Académie de La Palette\", Académie Julian, Académie Colarossi and the vast École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts.\n\nAccording to some sources, the \"Académie de La Palette\" was originally located in Montparnasse, Rue de l'Arrivée in the 15th arrondissement of Paris, and may have had as founder the Swiss painter Martha Stettler, linking it to the Académie de la Grande Chaumière, also founded by Stettler. It remains unclear exactly when the academy was founded.\nAccording to another source, the artist Fernand Cormon founded an art school in 1882 by the name of \"Atelier Cormon\", at 10 rue Constance in Paris. In 1888 the academy moved to 104 Boulevard de Clichy in the 18th arrondissement of Paris where it became known as \"Académie de La Palette\". At that location Eugène Carrière became a professor, along with Pierre Puvis de Chavannes. At that time artists such as Santiago Rusiñol studied at \"La Palette\" under Henri Gervex.\n\nThe art school, subsequently relocated to 18 rue du Val-de-Grâce in the 5th arrondissement of Paris.\n\nBetween 1902 and 1911 Jacques-Émile Blanche directed the academy; his bilingualism attracting many English and North American students seeking exposure to the latest avant-garde tendencies. Under his tutelage instruction was offered in both French and English. Teachers during the early years included Lucien Simon, Charles Cottet, Georges Desvallières, who co-founded the Salon d'Automne, Edmond Aman-Jean, Lucien Simon, Charles-François-Prosper Guérin, René François Xavier Prinet (1861-1946) and others. According to a notice in the journal \"La Revue de France et des Pays Français\" (March–April 1912), Mac Neill had been the director of the school.\nIn 1905 the Russians Sonia Terk, and Marie Vassilieff graduated from this academy. Fellow students at \"La Palette\" included Amédée Ozenfant, André Dunoyer de Segonzac and Roger de La Fresnaye.\n\nFebruary 1912 Henri Le Fauconnier was appointed to succeed Jacques-Émile Blanche as \"chef d'atelier\". Le Fauconnier commissioned Jean Metzinger and André Dunoyer de Segonzac as full-time instructors for the morning sessions; Eugène Zak and took over in the afternoon. Dunoyer de Segonzac had from 1907 attended the school and worked part-time together with John Duncan Fergusson. \n\nAt this time the academy primarily attracted French, Danish and Russian students. Some of the students known to have attended were Marcel Gromaire and Marc Chagall. Though Chagall's studies at La Palette were intermittent and succinct, it was there that Chagall frequented artists at the forefront of the Parisian avant-garde. His experimentations at the time centered on Fauvist colors and Cubist construction. His instructors were Le Fauconnier and Metzinger.\n\nIn the fall of 1912 Liubov Popova and Nadezhda Udaltsova enrolled at \"La Palette\" following the advice of Alexandra Exter. According to Udaltzova, Jean Metzinger encouraged the students to the visit gallery and salons where Cubist works were exhibited. The price for a half-day classes was 40 francs per month. Metzinger's students at \"La Palette\" included , Jessica Dismorr, Nadezhda Udaltsova, Varvara Stepanova and Lyubov Popova.\n\n\n\"In November 1912 I went to Paris with Liubov Popova\", Udaltsova writes in her memoirs, \"Sofia Karentnikova and Vera Petel also travelled with us although they soon returned to Moscow. After looking around, Popova and I began to search for a studio. Our intention had been to work with Matisse but his school was already closed, so we went over to Maurice Denis’s studio. But there we ran into a Red Indian with feathers sitting against a red background and we ran away. Someone then told us about \"La Palette\", the studio of Le Fauconnier. We went there and immediately decided that it was what we wanted… Le Fauconnier, Metzinger and Segonzac used to visit the studio once a week. Le Fauconnier offered pictorial solutions for the canvas while Metzinger spoke of Picasso’s latest accomplishments. That was still the time of classical Cubism without all the vie banale – which first appeared in the form of wallpaper and appliqués in the works of Braque. Le Fauconnier was a ferocious expert and many a student trembled before the canvas. Both Le Fauconnier and Metzinger responded positively to my works and I was so happy when Metzinger told me two weeks later, “Vous avez fait de progrès extraordinaire” [“You have made extraordinary progress”]. How the students looked at me!. Another entry in Udaltsova’s diary reads: “Liubov Sergeevna [Popova] understood little of what Le Fauconnier was saying. Everything is broken down into a thousand lines; she has no feel for the plane\".\n\nPopova continued working in a Cubist style influenced in particular by Jean Metzinger through 1913.\n\n\n\"There was no question which was my way. True, I was not alone, but in the company of several artists who came from Eastern Europe. I joined the cubists in the Académie La Palette, which became the sanctuary of the new direction in art. On my part I did not want to imitate anyone or anything. This is why I joined the cubists movement.\" (Joseph Csaky)\n\n\n\n\n"}

He posted a YouTube video stating that he would not file federal income tax returns or pay federal income tax.\n\nIn 2008, he was sentenced to three years probation in Orange County, California on a weapons charge. According to the Associated Press, his three-year probation was revoked in 2009. Chi also faced a charge in Collin County, Texas, for allegedly failing to identify himself as a fugitive.\n\nAlso in 2008, he self-published a novel, \"Yellow on the Outside, Shame on the Inside: Asian Culture Revealed\".

Also known as Art on the Net, the site was established in June, 1994 with a manifesto and statement of purpose as an Internet art project site and online art gallery.\n\nArtists create and maintain studio web spaces on the site and gallery pages where they show their works and share information about themselves. Artists are also encouraged to collaborate and to help each other promote and improve their art. They can learn how to curate and show their art work via the web. Several member artists also teach art in their studio spaces located on Art.Net. Art.Net is open to new artists and new areas. New artists are invited to join and submit their work for display. The site provides and supports a variety of online art resources.\n\nArt.Net is owned and operated by the member artists, and has been active in defending free speech on the Internet. With the help of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Art.Net has been involved in many court cases defending freedom of speech on the Internet. In each case, members were asked to testify in court about how laws censoring content on the Internet prevented the sharing of art due to fear of prosecution. There have been four such cases, in four different states. Each was successful in bringing injunctions against laws, preventing their enforcement. This happened during the time that each state was trying to create local Communications Decency Act (CDA) laws for their local states.\nThe website does not censor the artists or their works posted on the site; artists are requested to share their art in a non-commercial way. Artists retain all rights to their works shown on Art.Net. The site typically receives more than 65,000 page views per day from more than 14,000 unique visitors. It has won several awards.\n\nIn the autumn of 1994, Art.Net suffered its first site break-in by the well known\nblack hat and cracker, Kevin Mitnick. This break-in was the beginning of Mitnick's downfall. Art.Net's webmaster requested the help of a master hacker, Tsutomu Shimomura, to deal with the cracker. The break-in was discovered \"while in process\" and Art.Net immediately responded by turning off all Internet services except for web access via httpd.\n\nIn the fall of 1995, Art.Net executed one of the first known reversed Web \n\"Denial of Service\" (aka DOS) attacks. A porn site had linked to one image of an Art.Net member artist's art on Art.Net without the artist's permission. When the artist noticed that the file was being accessed more than usual (several thousand times a day), she reported the strange event to the Art.Net site webmaster. The art image file was moved to another filename and by way of the Apache webserver running on Art.Net, accesses to the original file name were redirected back to the offending website's sendmail port. The offending machine went down in a few minutes due to the overload of sendmail connections to their site. A few days later the offending link to the art was removed from the porn site.\n\nJune, 1994 - established.\n\nFebruary, 1996 - joined in the Black World Wide Web protest\nfrom February 8 until February 24 to protest the signing of the telecommunications bill that included the CDA by Bill Clinton on February 8, 1996 as part of the Blue Ribbon Online Free Speech Campaign. Art.Net continued showing the Blue Ribbon on site entrance page to show support of freedom of speech on the Internet.\n\nJune, 1996 - new link submission form\nwas added on the site.\n\nMarch, 1997 - joined in the lawsuit \"ALA v. Pataki\" as a plaintiff to challenge New York's Internet censorship law. Art.Net\nwas placed in jeopardy to help defend freedom of speech on the Internet by joining this case. If it had lost, there would have been a strong chance that the site must shut down because of censorship laws. Represented by the ACLU, the case was won for the plaintiffs Art.Net and many others, and a preliminary injunction against New York's censorship law, preserving freedom of speech on the Internet, was issued.\n\nJune, 1998 - joined in the lawsuit \"ACLU v. Johnson\" as a plaintiff to challenge New Mexico's online censorship law. This was \nan important case because even though the ACLU won, the case was appealed by New Mexico. The appeals court upheld the ruling, so now this case is a federal precedent, supporting the freedom of speech on the Internet for all U.S. citizens.\n\nJune 1999 - joined as a plaintiff in \"Cyberspace v. Engler\", with the ACLU, challenging Michigan's cyber-censorship law, citing the US Constitution's commerce clause and free speech rights. The court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, again upholding the right of free speech on the Internet.\n\nMarch 2002 - in the article, \"Fahrenheit 451.2: Is Cyberspace Burning?\",\nthe Internet is shown to deserve the same high level of free speech protection afforded to books and other printed matter. Art.Net is shown as an example of why self-rating is burdensome, unwieldy, and costly for websites to implement.\n\n"}

Because of the chemical makeup of the plaster, a binder is not required.\n\nAfter a number of hours the plaster reacts with the air in a process called carbonatation. This chemical reaction fixes the pigment particles at the plaster's surface in a protective crystalline mesh known as the lime crust.\n\nThe advantage of Buon fresco is its durability. In \"fresco-secco\", by contrast, the color does not become part of the wall and tends to flake off over time. The chief disadvantage of Buon fresco is that it must be done quickly without mistakes.\n\nThe painter plasters and paints only as much as can be completed in a day, which explains the Italian term for each of these sections, \"giornata\", or a day's work. The size of a giornata varies according to the complexity of the painting within it. A face, for instance, might take an entire day, whereas large areas of sky can be painted quite rapidly.\n\nFrescoes dating from the 17th century BC using this technique have been found n the excavations of Akrotiri on the island of Santorini in Greece, changing our beliefs about art in prehistoric times.\n\nOne of the first painters in the post-classical period to use this technique was the Isaac Master in the Upper Basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi.\n\nIn medieval and Renaissance Italy, a wall to be frescoed was first prepared with a rough, thick undercoat of plaster known as the arriccio. When this was dry, assistants copied the master painter's composition onto it with reddish-brown pigment or charcoal. The artist made any necessary adjustments.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19284595", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19284595", "title": "Domestic realism", "text": "Domestic realism\n\nDomestic realism normally refers to the genre of 19th-century novels popular with women readers. This body of writing is also known as \"sentimental fiction\" or \"woman's fiction\". The genre is mainly reflected in the novel though short-stories and non-fiction works such as Harriet Beecher Stowe's \"Our Country Neighbors\" and \"The New Housekeeper's Manual\" written by Stowe and her sister-in-law Catharine Beecher are works of domestic realism. The style's particular characteristics are:\n\n\"1. Plot focuses on a heroine who embodies one of two types of exemplar: the angel and the practical woman (Reynolds) who sometimes exist in the same work. Baym says that this heroine is contrasted with the passive woman (incompetent, cowardly, ignorant; often the heroine's mother is this type) and the \"belle,\" who is deprived of a proper education.\n\n2. The heroine struggles for self-mastery, learning the pain of conquering her own passions (Tompkins, Sensational Designs, 172).\n\n3. The heroine learns to balance society's demands for self-denial with her own desire for autonomy, a struggle often addressed in terms of religion.\n\n4. She suffers at the hands of abusers of power before establishing a network of surrogate kin.\n\n5. The plots \"repeatedly identify immersion in feeling as one of the great temptations and dangers for a developing woman. They show that feeling must be controlled. . . \" (Baym 25). Frances Cogan notes that the heroines thus undergo a full education within which to realize feminine obligations (The All-American Girl).\n\n6. The tales generally end with marriage, usually one of two possible kinds:\n\nA. Reforming the bad or \"wild\" male, as in Augusta Evans's \"St. Elmo\" (1867)\n\nB. Marrying the solid male who already meets her qualifications.\nExamples: Maria Cummins, \"The Lamplighter\" (1854) and Susan Warner, \"The Wide, Wide World\" (1850) \n\n7. The novels may use a \"language of tears\" that evokes sympathy from the readers.\n\n8. Richard Brodhead (Cultures of Letters) sees class as an important issue, as the ideal family or heroine is poised between a lower-class family exemplifying poverty and domestic disorganization and upper-class characters exemplifying an idle, frivolous existence (94).\"\n\nAn example of this style of novel is Jane Smiley's \"A Thousand Acres\" in which the main character's confinement is emphasized in such a way.\n\nSome early exponents of the genre of domestic realism were Jane Austen and Elizabeth Barrett Browning.\n"}
{"id": "2074640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2074640", "title": "Earth Song", "text": "Earth Song\n\n\"Earth Song\" is a song by American singer Michael Jackson from his ninth studio album \"\". It was released on November 27, 1995 as the third single from the album. It is a ballad that incorporates elements of blues, gospel and opera. Jackson had a long history of releasing socially conscious material such as \"We Are the World\", \"Man in the Mirror\" and \"Heal the World\". However, \"Earth Song\" was the first that overtly dealt with the environment and animal welfare. \"Earth Song\" was made for the \"Dangerous\" album but it failed to make the final cut. The song was written by Jackson and produced by Jackson, David Foster and Bill Bottrell.\n\n\"Earth Song\" was accompanied by a lavish music video shot in four geographical regions. The video centered on the destruction and rebirth of Earth and went on to receive a Grammy nomination in 1997. The song went number one in the United Kingdom, and was the nation's number-one Christmas single in 1995. It also topped the charts in Germany, Iceland, Italy, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland while peaking at number two in France, Ireland, and the Netherlands. Jackson went on to receive recognition from various animal and environmental organizations.\n\nIn 2011 the song was paired with the poem \"Planet Earth\" (previously released on \"Michael Jackson's This Is It\", in 2009) and released as a song in the remix album \"Immortal\". \n\nJackson already had a history of charitable or socially conscious material. As a child, he recorded the song \"In Our Small Way\" for his first album \"Got to Be There\" in 1971. As an adult, he used his fame and wealth to promote various causes. In 1985, he co-wrote the charity single \"We Are the World\" with Lionel Richie, which was released worldwide to aid the poor in Africa and the US. The single became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with nearly 20 million copies sold and millions of dollars donated to famine relief. It was also the first time Jackson was seen as a humanitarian. All of the profits from his single \"Man in the Mirror\" went to charity. Jackson founded the \"Heal the World Foundation\" in 1992, inspired by his charity single of the same name.\n\nFollowing the illness and death of Ryan White, Jackson helped draw public attention to HIV/AIDS, something that was still controversial at the time. He publicly pleaded with the Clinton Administration at Bill Clinton's Inaugural Gala to give more money to HIV/AIDS charities and research. He would go on to perform the song \"Gone Too Soon\" for White and other victims of the illness.\n\n\"Earth Song\" was written by Jackson in the Hotel Imperial in Vienna, Austria under the working title \"What About Us\". An early version, which featured Jackson singing the ending in falsetto, was set to be released as part of a bonus disc for the remastered \"Dangerous\" album in 2001 but the release was cancelled; that version along with other tracks were leaked on the internet.\n\n\"Earth Song\" was produced by Jackson, David Foster and Bill Bottrell. Andrae Crouch's Choir and Jackson engage in a back and forth chant as the song reaches its climactic finale. Jackson's intent was to create a song that was lyrically deep yet melodically simple, so the whole world, particularly non-English-speaking fans, could sing along. He conceptualized a song that had an emotional message.\n\n\"Earth Song\" is a ballad that incorporates elements of blues, gospel and opera. In the socially conscious track, Jackson issues a wakeup-call about the dire situations that mankind has caused and is facing, ranging from war to devastation to animals and earth itself. The song reveals itself to be highly spiritual at the end where Jackson calls on people to remember the earth is their inheritance from God via their ancestor Abraham. \"What about death again\" reminds all to think about eternal death, asking people to check their heart for repentance, or to see if they really cared at all. Having disfellowshipped himself from Jehovah's Witnesses, Jackson simplified his faith to focus on the Biblical Jesus Christ until his death. \n\n\"Earth Song\" received mixed reviews from music critics. James Hunter of \"Rolling Stone\" stated, \"The slow blues-operatic 'Earth Song' for all its noble sentiments, sounds primarily like a showpiece\". A \"San Jose Mercury News\" review called it \"flat\" and \"whiny\", believing Jackson had already experimented with these concepts earlier in his career.\n\n\"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" described the track as \"a healing, rhythmic ballad that evokes religious imagery\". A review in \"The Sacramento Bee\" was favorable, describing Jackson's vocal performance as \"cool\". Michael Mehle of \"Rocky Mountain News\" described the finale as \"anthemic\" and a \"powerful gospel opus\". A \"Ledger-Enquirer\" review observed of \"Earth Song\", \"[it] enjoys the same kind of subtlety, building to a dramatic call-and-response finish with the Andrae Crouch Choir\". \"Contra Costa Times\"'s review called it \"a bit sappy and overblown\" but also acknowledged that it was \"epic\" and destined to be a \"massive smash hit\".\n\nIn 2017, ShortList's Dave Fawbert listed the song as containing \"one of the greatest key changes in music history\". \n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Earth Song\" debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, where it remained for six weeks throughout December 1995 — beating the U2/Brian Eno project Passengers in competition to win the Christmas number one spot — and into early-1996. During its stay at number one, \"Earth Song\" kept the first single released by The Beatles in 25 years, \"Free as a Bird\", off the number one position. In early December, bookmakers correctly predicted that Jackson would keep The Beatles off the top position and go on to attain the Christmas number-one single. It has gone on to sell 1,210,297 copies in the nation as of September 2017.\n\nThe song also took the number one position in Iceland, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, peaking within the top five in almost every European state.\nIn Germany, it was Jackson's first single to reach No. 1 on the German Singles Chart and held the summit for 5 consecutive weeks.\n\nThe song was only released to radio in the U.S., appearing on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. In 2006, \"Earth Song\" reached number 55 on the European Hot 100 Singles chart, following the \"\" campaign, whereby 20 of Jackson's hit singles from the 1980s to the 1990s were reissued in several European countries.\n\nJackson received the Genesis Award: 1995 Doris Day Music Award, given each year for animal sensitivity. In 2008, a writer for the Nigeria Exchange noted, \"'Earth Song' drew the world's attention to the degradation and bastardization of the earth as a fall out of various human activities\".\n\nThe music video for \"Earth Song\", directed by fine art photographer Nick Brandt, was expensive and well-received; it gained a \"Le Film Fantastique: Best Video Award\" in 1996, the 1995 Doris Day Music Award at the Genesis Awards and a Grammy nomination for Best Music Video, Short Form in 1997. The production had an environmental theme, showing images of animal cruelty, deforestation, pollution, poaching, poverty and war. Jackson and the world's people unite in a spiritual chant—\"Earth Song\"—which summons a force that heals the world. Using special effects, time is reversed so that life returns, war ends and the forests regrow. The video closes with a request for donations to Jackson's Heal the World Foundation. The clip was shown infrequently in the United States.\n\nThe video was filmed in four geographic regions (Americas, Europe and Africa). The first location was the Amazon Rainforest, where a large part was destroyed a week after the video's completion. Natives of the region appeared in the video and were not actors. The second scene was a war zone in Karlovac, Croatia, with famous Serbian actor Slobodan Dimitrijević and the residents of the area. The third location was Tanzania, which incorporated scenes of illegal poaching and hunting into the video. No animals were harmed in the making of the \"Earth Song\", as the footage came from documentary archives. The final location was in Warwick, New York, where a safe forest fire was simulated in a corn field.\n\nThe video was also included on the video albums: \"HIStory on Film, Volume II\", \"Number Ones\" and \"Michael Jackson's Vision\".\n\nOn February 19, 1996, Jackson performed \"Earth Song\" at the Brit Awards in the United Kingdom; he was there to collect a special \"Artist of a Generation\" award. Jackson sang while dangling off the edge of a high rise crane elevator, which he had used the year before while performing it on the German TV show Wetten Dass. Below, a chorus of backing performers joined in and many began to embrace Jackson upon his descent.\n\nDuring the performance, singer Jarvis Cocker ran onstage without permission, lifted his shirt and pretended to break wind, before giving Jackson the V-sign. Cocker was there with his band Pulp, who had been nominated for three Brit awards. He was questioned by police over claims he had assaulted some of the child performers, but he was released without charge. Cocker stated that he found the performance offensive, claiming that Jackson had portrayed himself as Christ-like and could do as he pleased because of his immense wealth and power. Jackson condemned Cocker's behavior as \"disgusting and cowardly\". The incident is referred to in the book \"Politics and Popular Culture\" by John Street, Professor of Politics at the University of East Anglia. He says:\nBut to read popular culture as a straight-forward – or at least typical – political text is to take a very narrow view of its meaning, and hence of its political message(s). As we have noted, the text's meaning will depend on how it is heard and read. Michael Jackson may have intended his \"Earth Song\" as an exercise in compassion; others – like Jarvis Cocker – saw it quite differently. One reason these alternative readings emerge is because of the way the performance of popular culture engages more than a literal text, it employs gestures and symbols, tones of voice, looks and glances, all of which might tell a different story.\nThe song, along with a 3-D short film that was to be featured in Jackson's series of comeback concerts This Is It, was performed as a tribute to Jackson. Jennifer Hudson, Carrie Underwood, Smokey Robinson, Celine Dion and Usher all sang the song together, while the video played in the background. The film was shown in its original 3-D format during the broadcast.\n\nTarget provided free 3-D glasses to customers a week before the Grammy Awards. Paris and Prince Jackson, Jackson's oldest children, appeared shortly after the performance to accept Jackson's Lifetime Achievement Award, where they both gave a short speech. This was the first time the children had spoken publicly since the memorial service that was held for Jackson on July 7, 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Cecil-Smith, Frank Love and Mildred Goldberg. Although the play made only one performance in its initial run, the attempts by the authorities to suppress it backfired into a political embarrassment for the Canadian government and Prime Minister R. B. Bennett. \n\nThe agit-prop play told the story of Tim Buck and his arrest as a Communist under Section 98 of the Criminal Code that made simple association with an organization advocating violent overthrow of the government a crime. However, such accusations were often made without regard to the organizations' actual intentions, effectively allowing the federal government to claim that any powerful group which potentially opposed them to be labelled as 'subversive'. Furthermore, it details the apparent assassination attempt on Buck during a prison riot when shots were fired into his cell despite the fact he was not participating in the riot in any way.\n\nThe play is most noted for the reaction of the local authorities following the play's one performance at Toronto's Standard Theatre on December 4, 1933. The police ordered the play closed and threatened to revoke the theatre's licence if the play was performed again. A theatre in Winnipeg had its licence revoked to pre-empt the play being performed there.\n\nWhen the Progressive Arts Club had a meeting to protest this censorship, a former minister, A. E. Smith, described the play and its allegations of the attempted assassination of the Communist leader. As a result, Smith was indicted for sedition, but the resulting trial allowed Buck to take the stand and relate the events of the incident in open court. Smith was acquitted, and Buck and his comrades were soon released afterward.\n\n\n"}

W. Crofts, B.D., Vicar of North Grimston, near Malton, Yorkshire. One of his maternal uncles was the Rev. William Carr, B.D. of Bolton Abbey, Yorkshire. His mother was Ellen Wordsworth, the daughter of a Leeds industrialist. Ernest studied at Rugby School, for several years, and then headed to Berlin where he developed his interest in art and decided upon a career as a painter. His first acquaintance with war was made in 1864 when he accompanied a Prussian doctor in the Schleswig-Holstein War, and the operations around Düppel. His sister Ellen Wordsworth Crofts married Sir Francis Darwin and was the mother of poet Frances Cornford.\n\nHe returned to London and became a pupil under A. B. Clay, but was back in Germany a few years later, this time studying at the Düsseldorf school of painting in Europe, where he studied under the German military artist, Emil Hünten, himself an ex-pupil of Horace Vernet, and at the time military and historical painter to the Prussian emperor. Under Hünten, Crofts' talent as a military painter grew, and in 1874, he exhibited \"Retreat\", representing an episode in the Franco-Prussian War during the Battle of Gravelotte, and in the same year, another scene from the same conflict, \"One touch of nature makes the whole world kin\" which won him the Crystal Palace prize medal. Both scenes were influenced by the artist's experience of witnessing some of the closing stages of the war, especially the battles of Weissenbourg, Wörth, and the siege of Strasbourg. While contributing regularly to the annual Royal Academy exhibition, he continued to live in Düsseldorf where he met his future wife.\nIn 1875, Crofts exhibited \"Ligny\" at the Royal Academy of Arts (RA) and at the International Exhibition in Philadelphia. The following year saw his picture representing \"The morning of the Battle of Waterloo\" which captured the dawn of the day with the tired and bespattered troops. One critic described it as follows: \"Mr. Crofts' large canvas is admirable in the grouping of the soldiers on the morning of the battle; the day is breaking, on a weary, wounded and mud-stained company, some lying on the bare ground with knapsacks for pillows, some up and preparing for the march. The artillery are just on the move, and the note of preparation is sounding. The tone of the picture reminds us of the French school\". The artist's first notable pictures of the English Civil War were exhibited in 1877, one of which depicted \"Oliver Cromwell at Marston Moor\". In the same year, he refused the offer of an appointment of military painter to the Prince of Roumania to be attached to his staff during the Russo-Turkish War.\n\nCrofts was elected an Associate of the RA on 19 July 1878, the year that his picture, \"Wellington on his march from Quatre Bras to Waterloo\" was shown. In the same year, his painting entitled \"The Morning of the Battle of Waterloo\" was shown at the Paris International Exhibition; this depicted the French army retiring from the battlefield, with Napoleon leaving his carriage and preparing to mount his horse. The artist walked and sketched much of the area around the battlefield of Waterloo including La Haye Sainte, Hougoumont and La Belle Alliance. In 1896, he was elected a full academician of the Royal Academy, and his Diploma Work, a Civil War scene, was entitled \"To the Rescue\". Two years later he succeeded Philip Calderon as keeper and trustee of the RA, which gave him accommodation at Burlington House. He was in effect chief director of the academy art schools as well as chief custodian of the Diploma Galley, which required \"firmness, kindness and tact,\" according to one obituary, and Crofts was noted for his \"pleasant manner, his good looks, and his amiability of character\" which made him an ideal keeper.\n\nBesides historical scenes, Crofts did paint some contemporary military events. In 1901, for instance, the king commissioned him to paint a picture of the distribution of the war medals following the Boer War. Two years later, he painted a large scene of the funeral of Queen Victoria. One of his most ambitious works was the panel in the ambulatory of the Royal Exchange which portrayed Elizabeth I opening the first Royal Exchange in 1571. His trilogy of paintings chronicling the final moments, death and burial of Charles I were popular, but there was some disagreement over the representation of the block upon which the king knelt to be beheaded. Some argued about the accuracy, contending that the block of the period was a lower one, being just a few inches from the ground, and that to reach it, the king would have had to lie flat.\n\nCrofts lived at 'The Green' which he helped to re-design, next to Blythburgh church in Suffolk. He had married a German lady, Elizabeth Wüsthofen of Düsseldorf, and they had one daughter. The artist died of pneumonia at Burlington House on 19 March 1911. His funeral service was held at St. James's Church, Piccadilly, on Thursday 23 March, followed by his burial at Kensal Green Cemetery. A sale of his remaining works was held at Christie, Manson & Woods on Monday 18 December 1911.\n\nWhile Crofts's pictures were popular in the 1870s and 1880s, the public lost its appetite for war paintings in the early years of the 20th century following the setbacks in South Africa. His obituary noted that \"his taste was a little theatrical, and his talent not good enough to redeem it...it is safe to say that he will be best remembered, not by them, but by his good work at the Academy Schools and by his administrative services to the body of which he was a useful member...the exacting taste of the present day asks for something less conventional than his rather superficial battle scenes\". While the artist's pictures continue to be used as illustration in history and military books, today he is rarely mentioned as a significant historical artist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In the 1950s they designed the central campus for the University of Sheffield and Castrol House, a tower on Marylebone Road in London, notable as one of the first uses of curtain walling on a building in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn the 1960s they went on to design two buildings at Undershaft in the City of London - the 28 storey Commercial Union Tower, which was the first building in the city to exceed the height of St Paul's Cathedral, and the now demolished headquarters of P&O. These buildings both featured an innovative structure by which the office floors are hung by steel rods from cantilevers extending out from the concrete core, rather than being supported from ground level.\n\nIn 1974 the three founders retired, leaving a well-established practice.

It was amongst the leading systems of its time, selling many hundreds of copies at a time when computer-aided design was rare and expensive. The term 'building model' (in the sense of BIM as used today) was first used in a 1986 paper by Robert Aish - then at GMW Computers - referring to the software's use at London Heathrow Airport's Terminal 3, and it is regarded as a forerunner to today's BIM software.\n\nBy the time of its 2015 acquisition by Scott Brownrigg, GMW had become a transport specialist.

In this museum, there are more than 2,000 different archaeological and architectural monuments – mounds, seats of ancient settlements, burial places dating back to thousands of years ago. \n\nThe reserve was established in the year of 2008 under the auspices of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation. It is located in Gala, 40km far from Baku and bears the name of this district. Gala- State Historical Ethnographic Reserve is devoted to the history of the Absheron Peninsula. As a result of archaeological excavations, it is feasible to get the picture of the lifestyle of the Azerbaijani people from ancient times to the Middle Ages.\n\nThere is an 18th century tandoor, two underground passages belonging to the 10th and 15th centuries. Besides these, old houses, portable tents made of animal skins, stone and straw houses with domes, an old smithy, a pottery workshop, and a thresher can be found. All these can be touched and photographed.\n\nOn October 2, 2013 the Cabinet of Ministers of Azerbaijan approved the Regulation on the special regime of the Gala State Historical-Ethnographic Reserve. In accordance with the Regulation, Gala-State Historical and Ethnographic Reserve is a state-protected area of architectural monuments, archaeological and ethnographic materials. The Reserve's Buffer Zone has been created by the Cabinet of Ministers of Azerbaijan in order to protect the historical-architectural appearance of the Reserve, the monuments located in the territory, their functional designation and longevity, as well as to protect the natural landscape formed around the Reserve.

There are also 400-year-old pistachio trees, figs, figs, olive trees, flowers and other decorative items in the territory of the reserve.\n\nIn 2008, on the initiative of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation, the Archeological and Ethnographic Museum Complex under the open sky was established. Archaeological architectural monuments discovered on the Absheron Peninsula were collected and restored here. The mounds, settlements and other architectural monuments of the 3rd-2nd millennium BC were built in the same way as before the era.\n\nAncient mounds, grave stones, dwellings, quarries, places of worship and some other material cultural remains found in the territory of Absheron Peninsula reflect the mood of the previous millennia. One of the mound is called \"Dubendi\". The basis of this mound is the rug-shaped stone masonry.\n\nTools made from sheep bones and stone were found in the Reserve area. The \"Turkan\" mound also consists of a ring-shaped stonework. There is also a quadrilateral hole in this mound.\n\nThere are residues of water and food wells, coffee houses, ancient houses in the territory of the reserve.

It was used in English from about the mid-19th century (for example, by William Makepeace Thackeray in 1840 in one of his Parisian sketches), but in the 20th century, came to be applied in its more modern sense.\n\nIn 1997 the publisher HarperCollins drew up a list of 101 words – one a year – that defined the years 1896 to 1997. \"Gamine\" was chosen for 1899, being described by Philip Howard in \"The Times\" as follows:\n\n\"Gamine\" has been used particularly of such women in the performing arts or world of fashion. In that context, the closest English word – of Anglo-Norman origin – is probably \"waif\" (although \"gamine\" is often seen as conveying an additional sense of style and chic). For example, in a press release of 1964, impresario Andrew Oldham described the 17-year-old singer Marianne Faithfull as \"shy, wistful, waif-like\"; and writer and musician John Amis referred to German-born actress Luise Rainer (b. 1910) as Paul Muni's \"waif-wife\" in the 1937 film, \"The Good Earth\".\n\n\"Gaminerie\" has sometimes been used in English with reference to the behaviour or characteristics of gamin(e)s.\n\nIn the early 20th century, silent films brought to public attention a number of actresses who sported a gamine look. These included the Canadian-born Mary Pickford (1892–1979), who became known as \"America’s Sweetheart\" and, with her husband Douglas Fairbanks, was one of the founders of the film production company United Artists; Lillian Gish (1893–1993), notably in \"Way Down East\" (1920); and Louise Brooks (1906–86), whose short bobbed hairstyle, widely copied in the 1920s, came to be regarded as both a gamine and a \"Bohemian\" trait (this style having first appeared among the Paris \"demi-monde\" before World War I and among London art students during the war.) In 1936, Charlie Chaplin cast his then-girlfriend Paulette Goddard (1910–1990) as an orphaned gamine (credited as \"A Gamin\") in one of his last silent films, \"Modern Times\".\n\nIn the 1950s \"gamine\" was applied notably to the style and appearance of the Belgian-born actress Audrey Hepburn (1929–1993): for example, in the films, \"Sabrina\" (1954) and \"Funny Face\" (1957). Hepburn also played the role of the gamine Gigi in New York (1951) in the play of that name, based on the novel (1945) by Colette, who had personally \"talent-spotted\" her when she was filming in Monte Carlo. On film and in photographs, Hepburn’s short hair and petite figure created a distinct and enduring \"look\", well defined by Don Macpherson, who cited her \"naïveté which did not rule out sophistication\", and described her as \"the first gamine to be accepted as overpoweringly chic\".\n\nOther film actresses of the period regarded as gamines included Leslie Caron (b. 1931), who played the leading role in the 1958 musical film of \"Gigi\"; Jean Seberg (1938–79), best known in \"Bonjour Tristesse\" (1957) and Jean-Luc Godard’s \"À bout de souffle\" (1960); Jean Simmons (1929-2010), for example, in \"Angel Face\" (1952); and Rita Tushingham (b. 1940), whose first starring role was in \"A Taste of Honey\" (1961). The French singer Juliette Greco (b. 1926), who emerged from Bohemian Paris in the late 1940s to become an international star in the 1950s, also had gamine qualities.\n\nIn many ways, the \"gamine look\" of the 1950s paved the way for the success of the following English models: Jean Shrimpton (b. 1942), one of the first to promote the mini-skirt in 1965; Twiggy (b. Lesley Hornby, 1949), who became \"The Face of '66\"; and Kate Moss (b. 1974), associated in the 1990s with the \"waif\" look and what, notably through an advertising campaign for Calvin Klein in 1997, became known as \"heroin chic.\" Moss was part of a trend of \"wafer\" thin models which was satirized in Neil Kerber’s strip cartoon \"Supermodels\" in the magazine \"Private Eye\".\n\nGamines share similarities with the modern, cinematic \"Manic Pixie Dream Girl\" stock character.\n\nOthers who have been described as gamines include Danish-French actress Anna Karina (b. 1940); American actresses Julia Roberts (b. 1967) (she was often compared to Audrey Hepburn at the start of her career), Edie Sedgwick (1943–1971), Elizabeth Hartman (1943–1987), Mia Farrow (b. 1945), Sissy Spacek (b. 1949), Winona Ryder (b. 1971), Michelle Williams (b. 1980), Gwyneth Paltrow (b. 1972), Calista Flockhart (b. 1964), Bridget Fonda (b. 1964), Mary Stuart Masterson (b. 1966), Jennifer Jason Leigh (b. 1962), and Ginnifer Goodwin (b. 1978); British actresses Carey Mulligan (b. 1985), Susannah York (1939–2011), Suzanna Hamilton (b. 1960), Helena Bonham Carter (b. 1966), Elisabeth Sladen (1946-2011), Carole Ann Ford (b. 1940) Tara FitzGerald (b. 1967), Olivia Williams (b. 1968), Rachel Weisz (b. 1970), Keira Knightley (b. 1985), and Emma Watson (b. 1990); Portuguese actress Maria de Medeiros (b. 1965); French actresses Juliette Binoche (b. 1964), Audrey Tautou (b. 1976), and Vanessa Paradis (b. 1972); Israeli-American actress Natalie Portman (b. 1981); Canadian model Linda Evangelista (b. 1965); American models Kristen McMenamy (b. 1964) and Tina Chow (1951–92) (whose \"gamine look made her the darling of [photographers] Cecil Beaton and Arthur Elgort\"); Russian tennis player Anastasia Myskina (b. 1981); and American singer Cat Power (b. Chan Marshall, 1972) (\"The French, in particular, took to her gamine looks and confused air\").\n\nPenelope Chetwode (1910–86), later Lady Betjeman, wife of the Poet Laureate, John Betjeman, was described by Betjeman's biographer A. N. Wilson as \"gamine of feature, but large-breasted\". Corinne Bailey Rae alleged that she was called a gamine in her song, \"Choux Pastry Heart\" (2005).\n\nJapanese 1990s J-Pop rock band vocalist Maki Watase was called a \"spry gamine firecracker\" in a review in the New Music Express.\n\nAmong the notable gamine characters of film are Gelsomina, the street performer from \"La Strada\", played by Giulietta Masina; Bree Daniels, the prostitute played by Jane Fonda (b. 1937) in \"Klute\" (1971) (whose hairstyle was sometimes referred to as the \"Klute shag\"); Nikita (Anne Parillaud, b. 1960), the titular punkish junkie in Luc Besson's 1990 film; and, most recently, Amélie (Audrey Tautou) in the 2001 romantic comedy of that name.\n"}

While most of the actions thought to be common among ghosts (chain clanking, cemetery haunting, and so forth) can be found, they are by no means so widespread in the popular ghostlore as we have been led to expect.

The work, written in 1132 or soon after, is one of the first autobiographical\nworks in medieval Western Europe, written in the form of a letter (and, as such, is clearly influenced by Augustine of Hippo's \"Confessions\").\n\nThis extensive letter provides an honest self-analysis of Peter Abelard's up to the age of about fifty-four. The \"Historia Calamitatum\" provides readers with knowledge of his views of women, learning, monastic life, Church and State combined, and the social milieu of the time. Within this important piece of literature, not only is one side of one of history's best-known love stories told, but integral parts of the history of the Middle Ages are revealed. It should be particularly noted that this book was written at a time when Western Europe was just surfacing into the world of philosophy. The \"Historia\" is exceptionally readable, and presents a remarkably honest self-portrait of a man who could be arrogant and often felt persecuted. It provides a clear and fascinating picture of intellectual life in Paris before the formalization of the University, of the intellectual excitement of the period, of monastic life, and of his affair with Heloise, one of history's most famous love stories. \nThroughout this letter, Abelard emphasizes how persecuted he feels by his peers. He quotes saints, apostles, and at one point, compares his struggles in likeness to those of Christ.\n\n\n"}

Comyns Carr\n\nJoseph William Comyns Carr (1 March 1849 – 12 December 1916) was an English drama and art critic, gallery director, author, poet, playwright and theatre manager.\n\nBeginning his career as an art critic, Carr was a vigorous advocate for Pre-Raphaelite art and a vocal critic of the \"short-sighted\" art establishment. In 1877 he became a director of the Grosvenor Gallery and promoting Pre-Raphaelite painters and other important exhibitors, such as James McNeill Whistler, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Edward Burne-Jones. Ten years later he founded the rival New Gallery.\n\nCarr also wrote essays, books, plays, librettos, English-language adaptations of foreign works and stage adaptations of Dickens novels and classic tales like \"King Arthur\" and \"Faust\".\n\nJ. Comyns Carr was born in Marylebone, Middlesex, England, the seventh of ten children. His parents were Jonathan Carr, a woollen draper, and his Irish wife, Catherine Grace Comyns. Kate Comyns Carr, his sister, became a portrait artist; his brother Jonathan Carr developed the world's first garden suburb Bedford Park. Comyns Carr was educated at Bruce Castle School, Tottenham, Middlesex, from 1862 to 1865. He studied law at the University of London and graduated in 1869, beginning to practise at the bar at the Inner Temple, London. He soon gave up law for a career in journalism and became drama critic for the \"Echo\".\n\nIn 1873 in Dresden, Carr married author Alice Laura Vansittart née Strettell (1850–1927), a novelist and designer. Alice designed the bold costume that Ellen Terry wore as Lady Macbeth, and in which John Singer Sargent painted her in 1889. Sargent also painted Mrs. Comyns Carr in 1889 and several portraits of her sister, Alma, and illustrated Alma's \"Spanish and Italian Folk-Songs\" in 1897. Carr and his wife had three children: Philip, Dorothy and Arthur (a barrister and Liberal Member of Parliament). Carr was a member of the Arts Club and the Garrick Club. He published two memoirs: \"Some Eminent Victorians\" (1908), and \"Coasting Bohemia\" (1914).\n\nCarr died of cancer at the age of 67 at his home in South Kensington, London. He was buried in Highgate Cemetery.\n\nIn 1873, Carr became an art critic for the \"Pall Mall Gazette\". The same year, in \"The Globe\", he wrote a series of widely read articles about contemporary artists. Dante Gabriel Rossetti took notice of these and befriended him. Carr was a strong critic of the art establishment, decrying what he saw as its short-sightedness. In 1875 He was engaged in 1875 by the influential French journal \"L'Art\" as its English editor. In 1881–83, he founded and edited \"Art and Letters\". As the first editor from 1883–86 of \"The English Illustrated Magazine\". He also wrote for a number of other journals including the \"Art Journal\", \"Saturday Review\", the \"Examiner\", the \"World\" and the \"Manchester Guardian\". Carr wrote books and articles about art championing the Pre-Raphaelite school of art, as well as monographic works on artists such as Edward Burne-Jones, Frederick Walker and Sir Hubert von Herkomer.\n\nCarr and Charles Hallé were appointed co-directors of the Grosvenor Gallery in 1877 by Sir Coutts Lindsay. The gallery promoted Pre-Raphaelite painters and exhibited provocative work. James McNeill Whistler, Rossetti and Burne-Jones exhibited frequently at the Grosvenor Gallery. In 1887, Carr and Hallé resigned from that gallery (which closed in 1890), after a dispute with Lindsay, and quickly founded the rival New Gallery, capturing Burne-Jones and most of the Grosvenor Gallery's other important artists. Carr continued as co-director until 1908. He also wrote the introduction to the British section of the 1911 International Exhibition of Fine Arts at Rome and later was chosen as the English representative to the Art Congress.\n\nCarr was also the author of dramatic works, beginning with several light comedies in the early 1880s for the German Reed Entertainments at St George's Hall. He also wrote numerous plays and adapted a number of French plays, such as \"Frou-Frou\", produced at the Princess's Theatre, London (1881); a stage adaptation of \"Far From the Madding Crowd\" co-authored with Thomas Hardy (1881); Hugh Conway's \"Called Back\" (1884), which was very successful for the actor–manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree; \"Dark Days\"; \"Boys Together\"; \"In the Days of the Duke\"; \"A Fireside Hamlet\"; \"The United Pair\"; \"The Naturalist\" (1887, an operetta with music by Charles King Hall); \"The Friar\"; and \"Forgiveness\". At the Haymarket Theatre from 1887 to 1893, Carr acted as Tree's literary adviser and partner.\nCarr leased the Comedy Theatre from 1893 to 1896. At the same time, his \"King Arthur\" (1895), a blank verse play inspired by the writings of Thomas Malory and Alfred Tennyson, as well as by the visual images of the Pre-Raphaelites, was produced by Henry Irving in the Lyceum Theatre. It starred Irving and Ellen Terry, with music composed by Arthur Sullivan and sets, costumes and artwork designed by Carr's friend Edward Burne-Jones. This spectacular production was a success for Irving and ran for over 100 performances, also touring North America. Another play that year was \"Delia Harding\", an adaptation of a Victorien Sardou play, at the Comedy Theatre. Also for Irving's company, in 1897 he produced an English version of \"Madame Sans-Gêne\" by Sardou and Émile Moreau in 1897, which played on both sides of the Atlantic. Carr also dramatised \"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" in 1910, starring H. B. Irving at Queen's Theatre.\n\nCarr collaborated with Arthur Wing Pinero and Arthur Sullivan on \"The Beauty Stone\", an opera billed as a \"romantic musical drama\", at the Savoy Theatre in 1898. The Faustian theme was not what the Savoy audiences were used to, and the piece never found an audience. Carr's adaptation of \"Oliver Twist\" was produced by Herbert Beerbohm Tree at His Majesty's Theatre, London (1905). It was also produced on Broadway in 1905 and 1912. From 1899 to 1904, after Irving transferred control of the Lyceum, Carr managed the theatre.\n\nCarr's \"Tristram and Iseult\" (1906), a pseudo-medieval drama, was produced at the Adelphi Theatre starring Matheson Lang, Lily Brayton and Oscar Asche. An adaptation of Dickens' \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood\" (1907) was produced by Tree in Cardiff. Carr's theory of the play was that Jasper, under the influence of opium, attempted to act upon his murderous impulses, but Drood, overhearing his uncle's ravings, was able to escape. This was followed by an adaptation of Goethe's \"Faust\", for Tree in 1908, in collaboration with Stephen Phillips.\n\nAt the Royal Opera House in 1913–14, Carr was artistic adviser. A fan of Richard Wagner, Carr was responsible for the first English performance of Wagner's \"Parsifal\" in 1914 at Covent Garden.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "273593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=273593", "title": "Jedda", "text": "Jedda\n\nJedda (released in the UK as Jedda the Uncivilized) is a 1955 Australian film written, produced and directed by Charles Chauvel. His last film, it is notable for being the first to star two Aboriginal actors, Robert Tudawali, better known Bobby Wilson and Ngarla Kunoth, now known as Rosalie Kunoth-Monks, in the leading roles. It was also the first Australian feature film to be shot in colour. \"Jedda\" is seen by some as an influential film in the development of Australian cinema, as setting a new standard for future Australian films. It won more international attention than previous Australian films, during a time when Hollywood films were dominating the Australian cinema. The director, Charles Chauvel, was nominated for the Golden Palm Award in the 1955 Cannes Film Festival, but lost to the American Delbert Mann for \"Marty\".\n\n Jedda is an Aboriginal girl born on a cattle station in the Northern Territory of Australia. After her mother dies giving birth to her, the child is brought to Sarah McMann, the wife of the station boss. Sarah has recently lost her own newborn to illness. She at first intends to give the baby to one of the Aboriginal women who work on the station, but then raises Jedda as her own, teaching her European ways and separating her from other Aborigines.\n\nJedda wants to learn about her own culture, but is forbidden by Sarah. When Jedda grows into a young woman, she becomes curious about an Aboriginal man from the bush named Marbuck. This tall stranger arouses strong feelings in her. She is lured to his camp one night by a song. Marbuck abducts her and sets off back to his tribal land, through crocodile-infested swamps.\n\nJoe, a half-caste stockman in love with Jedda, tracks the two for several days. They travel across high, rocky country, and down a river until Marbuck reaches his tribe. The tribal council declares that Marbuck has committed a serious crime by bringing Jedda to them, because she is not of the right skin group. They sing his death song as punishment. Marbuck defies the elders and takes Jedda into an area of steep cliffs and canyons, taboo lands. Driven insane by the death song, he pulls Jedda with him over a tall cliff, and both perish. Joe, the narrator, says her spirit has joined \"the great mother of the world, in the dreaming time of tomorrow.\"\n\n\nCharles Chauvel says the original inspiration for the film came from a meeting he had in Hollywood in early 1950 with Merian C. Cooper. Cooper encouraged the director to make a film exploiting Australian locations. Chauvel was further encouraged along these lines by Bess Meredyth who had made a number of films in Australia in the 1920s.\n\nChauvel decided to make the project in the Northern Territory. With his wife Elsa he made an extensive survey of the Territory later that year with the assistance of the Commonwealth government. He undertook colour tests, intending to make Australia's first colour movie. The Chauvels then wrote a screenplay, originally entitled \"The Northern Territory Story\".\n\nThe lead aboriginal character was reportedly inspired by the warrior Nemarluk, who killed three Japanese pearlers in the 1930s and died in prison.\n\nIn 1951 Chauvel formed Chauvel Productions Ltd to make the film, with a notional capital of £500,000. It went public in August 1951, offering 240,000 shares.\n\nChauvel later claimed he turned down an American offer of $100,000 (£44,000) to finance the film because it was conditional upon Linda Darnell being cast in the lead. Chauvel's regular backers Universal Pictures did not want to invest in the movie but Chauvel managed to secure finance from various businessmen, including Mainguard Australia Ltd. It took the Chauvels 18 months to find a suitable filming location.\n\nFilming started in May 1952, when the unit left Sydney for Darwin. By this stage the lead role of Jedda had still yet to be cast, but filming acting sequences did not begin until July. Robert Tudawali was a full-blooded aboriginal from Melville Island. Ngarla Kunoth (Rosalie Kunoth-Monks) was an Anmatyerre woman, born at Utopia cattle station, north east of Alice Springs; she was selected over seven other actors screen tested, and was cast by July.\n\nThe shoot took five months to complete, plus post-production work done in Sydney. Most of the scenes were shot on the Coolibah Station in the Northern Territory, as well as at Standley Chasm, Ormiston Gorge and Mary River in the north.\n\nThe Chauvels celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary during filming. Wason Byers, who had a small role, was arrested for stealing over £1,000 worth of cattle.\n\nThe production process was laborious, as the colour technique used, Gevacolor, could only be processed in England. The film stock was fragile and heat-sensitive, which was a problem in the tropical climate of the Northern Territory. During production, the film was stored in cool caves to protect it from deteriorating. By mid 1952 the film had incurred expenses of £24,673.\n\nThe last roll of negative was destroyed in a plane crash on its way for developing in England. Chauvel re-shot these lost scenes at Kanangra Walls in the Blue Mountains and Jenolan Caves west of Sydney. Cave scenes were Filmed in the River Cave, Diamond Cave, Imperial Cave, and Mud Tunnels at Jenolan. Editing and sound recording were completed in London.\n\nThe music was written by Isador Goodman. Elsa Chauvel, the director's wife, replaced large parts of Goodman's score with old-fashioned commercial ‘mood’ music.\n\nThe film has its world premiere on 3 January 1955 at the Star Theatre in Darwin. The theatre's manager Tom Harris arranged for a member of the Warhiti tribe \"to sing songs and burn sticks to prevent any unwanted rainfalls during the screening. He decorated the theatre for the opening with pandanus, grass mats and Aboriginal artefacts. Large crowds gathered along Smith Street to catch a glimpse of the film's stars Ngarla Kunoth and Robert Tudawali were permitted to sit in the balcony with the Northern Territory Administrator Frank Wise and his wife.\n\nThe film then opened in Sydney in May. Its commercial reception was solid rather than sensational: Charles Chauvel Productions Ltd received £17,915 from the film in May and June 1955. The company's name was changed to Jedda Ltd to help exploit the film. In December 1956 Jedda Ltd reported a profit of £50,454 for the year to 30 June, reducing the debit balance in the production account to £69,697. The film had been successful in Australia but performed disappointingly overseas.\n\nThe film was released in the UK as \"Jedda the Uncivilised\".\n\nSome time after the film was completed and released in locations around the world, the film in Gevacolor was found to have faded from aging. In 1972 the film was reproduced from original tri-separations found in London.\n\nThis was Charles Chauvel's last feature film. He intended to adapt Kay Glasson Taylor's novel \"The Wars of the Outer March\" but was hired by the BBC to make the TV series \"Walkabout\". Before he could resume work on his feature projects he died on 11 November 1959.\n\n\n"}

French Chilean architect Claudio Brunet des Baines was commissioned for its design, and its construction was entrusted to another French Chilean, civil engineer Felipe Charme de l´Isle. Brunet des Baines created a French Neoclassical exterior for the theater, though his 1855 death left the supervision of the design to his countryman, Lucien Henault, and to the latter's assistant, Manuel Aldunate. The new team also benefited from a collaboration with Charles Garnier, the architect of the Opéra National de Paris.\nThe Teatro Municipal was inaugurated on September 17, 1857, with the opera \"Ernani\" by Giuseppe Verdi, performed by an Italian company brought in specially for the occasion. At the time, the theatre held 1,800 spectators, and included distinctive interior details such as a teardrop crystal chandelier. A December 8, 1870, performance by opera diva Carlotta Patti was followed by a massive fire, which practically destroyed the building. A quick response by both the local government and Chilean high society resulted in the theatre's prompt reconstruction, designed by Henault and completed on July 16, 1873. Its reinauguration was accompanied by a performance of Verdi's \"La forza del destino\".\n\nThe theatre went through a devastating 1906 earthquake, suffering the loss of most of its interior, and a second, serious fire in 1927, although it recovered quickly on both occasions. Following these reconstructions, the theatre's capacity was reduced to 1,500 in the main hall; however, its interior became more opulent. It was further modernized in 1952 and 1959, and numerous cultural institutions were created for the theatre during that era. The \"Santiago Philharmonic Orchestra\" was established in 1955, the Cultural Corporation of Santiago was formed to administer the center in 1957, the \"Santiago Ballet\" in 1959, and the \"Teatro Municipal Chorus\", in 1962.\n\nThe Teatro Municipal was declared a National Monument, in 1974. The theatre hosted the two editions of the OTI Festival in Chile: in 1978 and in 1986. Renowned Chilean pianist Claudio Arrau, who had left his homeland in 1941, returned for a visit in 1984, on which occasion the Claudio Arrau Salon, seating 250 spectators, was inaugurated. The stage curtain, installed in 1926, was replaced in 1995 with funds raised by offering donors a piece of the older curtain as a keepsake. \n\nThe institution continues to maintain an active repertoire, and some of its most illustrious recent international guest performers and conductors have included: names in ballet such as Julio Bocca, Mikhail Baryshnikov, the Bolshoi Ballet and the Mariinsky Ballet; pianists Claudio Arrau, Valentina Igoshina and Arthur Rubinstein, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Daniel Barenboim; violinists Mischa Elman, Jascha Heifetz, Yehudi Menuhin, Gil Shaham and Isaac Stern; conductors Zubin Mehta, Charles Dutoit, Kurt Masur and Pierre Boulez; and stage performers such as Plácido Domingo, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, Charles Aznavour, Vivien Leigh, Luciano Pavarotti, Tito Schipa and Renée Fleming.\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\n"}

The introduction of new materials (and techniques) and heretofore non-art materials helped drive change in art during the 20th century. Traditional materials and techniques were not necessarily displaced in the 20th century. Rather, they functioned alongside innovations that came with the 20th century. Such mainstays as oil-on-canvas painting, and sculpting in traditional materials continued right through the 20th century into the 21st century. Furthermore, even \"traditional\" materials were greatly expanded in the course of the 20th century. The number of pigments available to artists (painters, primarily) has increased both in quantity and quality, by most reckoning. New formulations for traditional materials especially the commercial availability of acrylic paint have become widely used, introducing initial issues over their stability and longevity.\n\nPablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Kurt Schwitters, Joseph Cornell and others incorporated paper collage and mixed drawing (materials) with paint to fashion their work. Both Picasso and Marcel Duchamp pioneered the use of found objects as material for paintings and sculpture during the 1910s. In the 1940s Jackson Pollock pioneered the use of housepaint, silver and aluminum paint, duco, and various objects for use in his paintings. In the 1950s Robert Rauschenberg included 3-D elements like tires and stuffed animals\nas well as using discarded materials like crushed or flattened cardboard boxes. Yves Klein incorporated live nude models and a symphony orchestra in his performance pieces of his paintings. John Chamberlain used crushed auto parts for sculpture. In the 1960s Pop artists Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, Tom Wesselmann and Roy Lichtenstein made art from commercial products, or art that resembled commercial products like television sets, soup cans, brillo boxes, comic books, household furniture and restaurant items among other things. Edward Kienholz made replicas of actual environments both domestic and commercial, while George Segal made life-size plaster figures in settings using real objects and props. Dan Flavin used electric fluorescent lights and ballasts to create sculpture. In the 1970s Frank Stella introduced honeycombed aluminum and glitter. In the 1980s Julian Schnabel made \"plate paintings\" with broken crockery stuck to the surface and then painted over, Anselm Kiefer and Richard Long used mud, soil or tar in their works. In the 1960s and again in the 1990s artists used excrement notably - the Italian artist Piero Manzoni in 1961 and the British artist Chris Ofili who specialized in using elephant dung in the 1990s. Tracey Emin included her bed, entitled My Bed, in 1999.\n\nSome innovations concerning materials used in art merely function in a supportive way, and other innovative materials are much more conspicuous. Frank Stella's use of honeycombed aluminum served as a lightweight and strong and very configurable support for imagery. In the sculpture entitled \"Monogram,\" by Robert Rauschenberg, an angora goat assumes a position of central importance.\n\nThe advent of Modernism and Modern Art in the first decades of the 20th century inspired artists to test and transcend the boundaries and the limitations of the traditional and conventional forms of art making in search of newer forms and in search of new materials. The innovations of painters like Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and the French Symbolists provided essential inspiration for the development of modern art by the younger generation of artists in Paris and elsewhere in Europe. Henri Matisse and other young artists revolutionized the Paris art world with \"wild\", multi-colored, expressive, paintings that the critics called Fauvism. Henri Rousseau, Pablo Picasso, Giorgio de Chirico, Amedeo Modigliani, Marc Chagall, Robert Delaunay and scores of young artists in Paris made their first modern paintings venturing toward abstraction and other new ways of formulating figurative, still-life and landscape imagery.\n\nDuring the first decade of the 20th century modern art developed simultaneously in several different areas in Europe (France, England, Scandinavia, Russia, Germany, Italy), and in the United States. Artists began to formulate different directions of modern art, seemingly unrelated to one another.\n\nIn printmaking, the linocut was invented by the artists of Die Brücke in Germany between 1905 and 1913. At first they described their prints as woodcuts, which sounded more respectable. The technique remains popular as a very simple method of printmaking, even suitable for use in schools.\n\nPablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Juan Gris and other cubist artists introduced new elements and materials like newspaper clippings, fabric, and sheet music into their paintings. Eventually the movement was called Synthetic Cubism developed between 1912 and 1919. Synthetic cubism is characterized by works with different textures, surfaces, collage elements, papier collé and a large variety of subject matter. It was the beginning of collage materials being introduced as an important ingredient of fine art work by the avant-garde.\n\nConsidered the first work of this new style was Pablo Picasso's \"Still Life with Chair-caning\" (1911–1912), which includes oil cloth that was printed to look like chair-caning pasted onto an oval canvas, with text; and rope framing the whole picture. At the upper left are the letters \"JOU\", which appear in many cubist paintings and refers to the newspaper titled \"Le Journal\".\n\nThe Dada movement began during World War I as a protest against the madness and violence of war. Applying shock tactics and anarchy to art the Dadaists pioneered the use of new artistic techniques such as collage, photomontage readymades and the use of found objects. Artists like Marcel Duchamp, Hannah Höch, Kurt Schwitters, Francis Picabia, Man Ray and others incorporated into their work random everyday objects often combined with more conventional artist materials. They included photographs, panes of glass, picture frames, eyeglasses, boxes, newspapers, magazines, ticket stubs, metal pipes, bulbs, bottle racks, urinals, bicycle wheels and other objects. Marcel Duchamp created \"The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even,\" working on the piece from 1915 to 1923. He made the work on two panes of glass; with materials such as lead foil, fuse wire, and dust.\n\nDuring the 1930s Surrealist artist Méret Oppenheim created sexually charged erotic pieces. Oppenheim's best known piece is \"Object (Le Déjeuner en fourrure)\" (1936). The sculpture consists of a teacup, saucer and spoon that the artist covered with fur from a Chinese gazelle. It is displayed at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.\n\nRobert Rauschenberg began to create what became known as his Combine paintings in the early 1950s.\n\nIn 1960 Yves Klein incorporated live nude models and a symphony orchestra in his performance pieces of his paintings. Klein also made use of Photomontage in the famous pseudo-performance picture of himself diving off a wall onto a Paris street \"Le Saut dans le Vide\" (Leap into the Void. In the 1960s John Chamberlain continued using crushed auto parts for sculpture. Dan Flavin used electric fluorescent lights and ballasts to create his sculpture. In May 1961 Italian artist Piero Manzoni used his own excrement, selling it in cans titled \"Artist's Shit\" (\"Merda d'Artista\"). However the contents of the cans remain a much-disputed enigma, since opening them would destroy the value of the artwork. Various theories about the contents have been proposed, including speculation that it is plaster.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "48405360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48405360", "title": "Origin of the Snow White tale", "text": "Origin of the Snow White tale\n\n\"Snow White\" is a German fairy tale known across much of Europe and is today one of the most famous fairy tales worldwide. The Brothers Grimm published it in 1812 in the first edition of their collection \"Grimms' Fairy Tales\". It was titled in (in modern orthography \"Schneewittchen\") and numbered as Tale 53. The Grimms completed their final revision of the story in 1854. It has generally been regarded as purely a tale of fiction; however, recent research suggests that the story may have been inspired from a real story.\n\nScholar Graham Anderson compares the story of Snow White to the Roman legend of Chione, recorded in Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\". The name \"Chione\" means \"Snow\" in Greek and, in the story, she is described as the most beautiful woman in the land, so beautiful that the gods Apollo and Mercury both fell in love with her. Mercury put her to sleep with the touch of his caduceus and raped her in her sleep. Then Apollo, disguised as an old crone, approached her and raped her again. These affections led Chione to openly boast that she was more beautiful than the goddess Diana herself, resulting in Diana shooting her through the tongue with an arrow.\n\nIn 1994, the German historian Eckhard Sander published \"Schneewittchen: Märchen oder Wahrheit?\" (Snow White: Fairy Tale or True Story?), claiming he had uncovered an account that may have inspired the story that first appeared in Grimm’s Fairy Tales. \nAccording to Sander, the character of Snow White was based on the life of Margaretha von Waldeck, daughter of Philip IV, Count of Waldeck-Wildungen (1493–1574) and his first wife, Margaret Cirksena (1500–1537), daughter of Edzard I, Count of East Frisia. According to Bad Wildungen city documents, she was famous for her beauty. Since 1539, she had a very strict stepmother, Katharina von Hatzfeld (1510–1546) and, perhaps soon after, Margaretha was raised at nearby Weilburg at the court of Philip III, Count of Nassau-Weilburg. In 1545 she traveled through the Siebengebirge (\"seven hills\") to live with her mother's brother Johann Cirksena (1506-1572) at Valkenburg Castle, in present day Limburg, Netherlands. In 1549, her father sent her on to the Brussels court of Mary of Hungary, governor of the Habsburg Netherlands and sister of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. Margaretha's presence at the court was partially meant to improve the relationship of her father with the emperor and help the release of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, who had been imprisoned in Brussels for his role in the Schmalkaldic War. \n\nThe situation at the court was complicated as several high ranking personalities were striving for Margaretha, including Lamoral, Count of Egmont. Charles V's son, Crown Prince Philip, arrived at his aunt's court in 1549. Tradition has it that he pursued Margaretha during the few months he was there as well, though there never could be any official relationship, as she was Lutheran. Three surviving letters from Margaretha to her father show that her health declined steadily over the next few years and she died at the age of 21 in March 1554. In Waldeck chronicles it was suggested that she had been poisoned. Since, however, her father's second wife died in 1546 and he only remarried again in October 1554, her stepmother never was a suspect in the alleged poisoning case. \n\nMargaretha's father owned several copper mines; a majority of workers were children, and Sander suggested that the legendary reference to the seven dwarfs is related to child labor in the mine. The residence of the seven dwarfs has been suggested to be the former copper mining village Bergfreiheit, now a district of Bad Wildungen that calls itself \"Schneewittchendorf\" (Snow White village). Like the fairy tale's dwarfs, the child laborers there used to live in groups of about 20 in a single room house.\n\nAccording to a study group in Lohr, Bavaria, Snow White is based on Maria Sophia von Erthal, born on 15 June 1729 in Lohr am Main, Bavaria. She was the daughter of 18th century landowner, Prince Philipp Christoph von Erthal and his wife, Baroness von Bettendorff.\nAfter the death of the Baroness, Prince Philipp went on to marry Claudia Elisabeth Maria von Venningen, Countess of Reichenstein, who was said to dislike her stepchildren. The castle where they lived, now a museum, was home to a ‘talking mirror’, an acoustical toy that could speak (now housed in the Spessart Museum). The mirror, constructed in 1720 by the Mirror Manufacture of the Electorate of Mainz in Lohr, had been in the house during the time that Maria’s stepmother lived there.\n\nThe dwarfs in Maria’s story are also linked to a mining town, Bieber, located just west of Lohr and set among seven mountains. The smallest tunnels could only be accessed by very short miners, who often wore bright hoods, as the dwarfs have frequently been depicted over the years.\nThe Lohr study group maintain that the glass coffin may be linked to the region’s famous glassworks, while the poisoned apple may be associated with the deadly nightshade poison that grows in abundance in Lohr.\n\n"}

{"id": "10034332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10034332", "title": "Relational art", "text": "Relational art\n\nRelational art or relational aesthetics is a mode or tendency in fine art practice originally observed and highlighted by French art critic Nicolas Bourriaud. Bourriaud defined the approach as \"a set of artistic practices which take as their theoretical and practical point of departure the whole of human relations and their social context, rather than an independent and private space.\" The artist can be more accurately viewed as the \"catalyst\" in relational art, rather than being at the centre.\n\nOne of the first attempts to analyze and categorize art from the 1990s, the idea of relational art was developed by Nicolas Bourriaud in 1998 in his book \"Esthétique relationnelle\" (\"Relational Aesthetics\"). The term was first used in 1996, in the catalogue for the exhibition \"Traffic\" curated by Bourriaud at CAPC musée d'art contemporain de Bordeaux. \"Traffic\" included the artists that Bourriaud would continue to refer to throughout the 1990s, such as Henry Bond, Vanessa Beecroft, Maurizio Cattelan, Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, Liam Gillick, Christine Hill, Carsten Höller, Pierre Huyghe, Miltos Manetas, Jorge Pardo, Philippe Parreno, and Rirkrit Tiravanija. The exhibition took its title and inspiration from Jacques Tati's film \"Trafic\"(1971), in which Tati's protagonist is a Parisian automobile designer preparing a new model for an international auto show. In a \"denoument\" that became a fundamental relational aesthetics strategy, particularly for Tiravanija, Tati's entire film is about the designer's journey to the auto show at which he arrives just in time for the show to close.\n\nBourriaud wishes to approach art in a way that ceases \"to take shelter behind Sixties art history\", and instead seeks to offer different criteria by which to analyse the often opaque and open-ended works of art of the 1990s. To achieve this, Bourriaud imports the language of the 1990s internet boom, using terminology such as user-friendliness, interactivity and DIY (do-it-yourself). In his 2002 book \"Postproduction: Culture as Screenplay: How Art Reprograms the World\", Bourriaud describes \"Relational Aesthetics\" as works that take as their point of departure the changing mental space opened by the internet.\n\nBourriaud explores the notion of relational aesthetics through examples of what he calls relational art. According to Bourriaud, relational art encompasses \"a set of artistic practices which take as their theoretical and practical point of departure the whole of human relations and their social context, rather than an independent and private space.\" The artwork creates a social environment in which people come together to participate in a shared activity. Bourriaud claims \"the role of artworks is no longer to form imaginary and utopian realities, but to actually be ways of living and models of action within the existing real, whatever scale chosen by the artist.\"\n\nRobert Stam, the head of new media and film studies at New York University, coined a term for the shared activity group: witnessing publics. Witnessing publics are \"that loose collection of individuals, constituted by and through the media, acting as observers of injustices that might otherwise go unreported or unanswered.\" The meaning of relational art is created when arts perception is altered while leaving the original artifact intact. \n\nIn relational art, the audience is envisaged as a community. Rather than the artwork being an encounter between a viewer and an object, relational art produces encounters between people. Through these encounters, meaning is elaborated \"collectively\", rather than in the space of individual consumption.\n\nWriter and director Ben Lewis has suggested that relational art is the new \"ism\", in analogue with \"ism\"s of earlier periods such as impressionism, expressionism and cubism.\n\nIn \"Antagonism and Relational Aesthetics\", published in 2004 in \"October\", Claire Bishop describes the aesthetic of Palais de Tokyo as a \"laboratory\", the \"curatorial modus operandi\" of art produced in the 1990s. Bishop writes, \"An effect of this insistent promotion of these ideas as artists-as-designer, function over contemplation, and open-endedness over aesthetic resolution is often ultimately to enhance the status of the curator, who gains credit for stage-managing the overall laboratory experience. As Hal Foster warned in the mid-1990s, 'the institution may overshadow the work that it otherwise highlights: it becomes the spectacle, it collects the cultural capital, and the director-curator becomes the star.'\" Bishop identifies Bourriaud's book as an important first step in identifying tendencies in the art of the 1990s but also writes in the same essay that such work “seems to derive from a creative misreading of poststructuralist theory: rather than the interpretations of a work of art being open to continual reassessment, the work of art itself is argued to be in perpetual flux.” Bishop also asks, \"if relational art produces human relations, then the next logical question to ask is what \"types\" of relations are being produced, for whom, and why?\" She continues that \"the relations set up by relational aesthetics are not intrinsically democratic, as Bourriaud suggests, since they rest too comfortably within an ideal of subjectivity as whole and of community as immanent togetherness.\"\n\nIn \"Traffic Control\", published one year later in \"Artforum\", artist and critic Joe Scanlan goes one step further in ascribing to relational aesthetics a palpable peer pressure. Scanlan writes, \"Firsthand experience has convinced me that relational aesthetics has more to do with peer pressure than collective action or egalitarianism, which would suggest that one of the best ways to control human behavior is to practice relational aesthetics.\"\n\nIn 2002, Bourriaud curated an exhibition at the San Francisco Art Institute, \"Touch: Relational Art from the 1990s to Now\", \"an exploration of the interactive works of a new generation of artists.\" Exhibited artists included Angela Bulloch, Liam Gillick, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Jens Haaning, Philippe Parreno, Gillian Wearing and Andrea Zittel. Critic Chris Cobb suggests that Bourriaud's \"snapshot\" of 1990s art is a confirmation of the term (and idea) of relational art, while illustrating \"different forms of social interaction as art that deal fundamentally with issues regarding public and private space.\"\n\nIn 2008, Guggenheim Museum curator Nancy Spector organized an exhibition with most of the artists associated with Relational Aesthetics, but the term itself was shelved in favor of calling the show \"Theanyspacewhatever\". The exhibition included stalwarts Bulloch, Gillick, Gonzalez-Foerster, Höller, Huyghe, and Tiravanija, along with loosely affiliated artists Maurizio Cattelan, Douglas Gordon, Jorge Pardo, and Andrea Zittel.\n\n\n"}

Furthermore, he said: \"Some wouldn't consider it art, but it's not porn, either. The drawings are educational, but they serve a purpose beyond illustration.\" Artnet columnist Paddy Johnson listed Seedfeeder's work as one of the \"Top 10 Digital Artworks of 2014\".\n\nSeedfeeder's drawings were also met with controversy. Some Wikipedia contributors perceived there to be racist and sexist undertones, resulting in the removal of some images from English-language Wikimedia projects. A depiction of a facial featuring a black man ejaculating onto a white woman prompted criticism, with some users claiming that the image was racist and promoted violence against women.\n\nSeedfeeder responded to those who argued that descriptions of sex acts without accompanying images would be best by saying: \"I come from a philosophical viewpoint that every Wikipedia article should have all forms of media available associated with it. Images, audio, and video. All articles, without exception. So any argument predicated on 'an image isn't necessary' is one that carries absolutely zero weight. None.\" In an interview with NaTemat, sexologist defended the images, saying that images of sexual activity are nothing new and that people should not be offended by sex.\n\nSeedfeeder also responded to criticism that children could discover his illustrations by writing, \"if your children are actively searching for these kind of topics... it's because they already have a slight idea of them... and they feel ready to know more.\"\n\n\n"}

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, much of the city's disaffected youth were influenced by the graffiti of New York, which subsequently became popular in Melbourne's inner suburbs, and along suburban railway and tram lines.\n\nMelbourne was a major city in which stencil art was embraced at an early stage, leading to the naming of Melbourne as \"stencil capital of the world\"; the adoption of stencil art also increased public awareness of the concept of street art. The first stencil festival in the world was held in Melbourne in 2004 and featured the work of many major international artists.\n\nAround the turn of the 21st century, forms of street art that began appearing in Melbourne included woodblocking, sticker art, poster art, wheatpasting, graphs, various forms of street installations and reverse graffiti. A strong sense of community ownership and DIY ethic exists amongst street artists in Melbourne, many of whom act as activists through awareness.\n\nGalleries in the City Centre and inner suburbs now exhibit street art. Prominent Melbourne street artists were featured in \"Space Invaders\", a 2010 exhibition of street art held at the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra. Hosier Lane is Melbourne's most famous laneway for street art, however there are many other laneways in the inner city that exhibit' street art.\n\nProminent international street artists such as Banksy (UK), ABOVE (USA), Fafi (France), D*FACE (UK), Logan Hicks, Revok (USA), Blek le Rat (France), Shepard Fairey (USA) and Invader (France) have contributed work to Melbourne's streets along with visitors from all over the world, most prominently Germany, Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and New Zealand.\n\nMelbourne's street art scene was explored in the 2005 feature documentary \"RASH\".\n\nWhile there are small areas throughout Greater Melbourne where various forms of street art can be seen, the primary areas in which street art is most densely located include:\n\nThe proliferation of street art in Melbourne has attracted supporters and detractors from various levels of government and in the broader community. In 2008 a tourism campaign at Florida's Disney World recreated a Melbourne laneway cityscape, decorated with street art. Victorian Premier John Brumby forced the tourism department to withdraw the display, calling graffiti a \"blight on the city\" and not something \"we want to be displaying overseas.\" Marcus Westbury countered that street art was one of Melbourne's \"biggest tourist attractions and one of its most significant cultural movements since the Heidelberg School\".\n\nSome street artists and academics have criticized the State Government for having seemingly inconsistent and contradictory views on graffiti. In 2006, the State Government \"proudly sponsored\" \"The Melbourne Design Guide\", a book which celebrates Melbourne graffiti from a design perspective. That same year, some of Melbourne's graffiti-covered laneways were featured in Tourism Victoria's \"Lose Yourself in Melbourne\" campaign. One year later, the State Government introduced tough anti-graffiti laws, with a maximum penalty of two years in prison. Possession of spray cans \"without a lawful excuse\", either on or around public transport, became illegal, and police search powers were also strengthened. According to Melbourne University criminologist Alison Young, the \"state is profiting from the work of artists doing it, but another arm of the state wants to prosecute and possibly imprison (such) people.\" Since laws were tightened, local councils have reported a \"spike\" in vandalism and greater incidences of tagging on commissioned murals and legal street art. Adrian Doyle, founder of the Blender Studios and manager of Melbourne Street Art Tours, believes that people who tag have become less considerate of where they put their tags for fear of being caught by police, and are \"paranoid so they are taking less time—tags are less detailed\". In 2007, the City of Melbourne started the \"Do art not tags\" initiative—an education presentation aimed at teaching primary school students the differences between graffiti and street art.\nSome local councils have accepted street art and have even made efforts to preserve it. In early 2008, the Melbourne City Council installed a perspex screen to prevent a 2003 Banksy stencil art piece named \"Little Diver\" from being destroyed. In December 2008, silver paint was poured behind the protective screen and tagged with the words: \"Banksy woz ere\". In April 2010, another stencil by Banksy, also painted in 2003, was destroyed—this time by council workers. The work depicted a parachuting rat and it was believed to be the last surviving Banksy stencil in Melbourne's laneways. Lord Mayor Robert Doyle said: \"This was not the \"Mona Lisa\". It is regrettable that we have lost it, but it was an honest mistake by our cleaners in removing tagging graffiti.\"\n\nThe loss of these and other famous street artworks in Melbourne reignited a decade long debate over heritage protection for Melbourne's street art. Planning Minister Justin Madden announced government plans in 2010 involving Heritage Victoria and the National Trust of Australia to assess street art in key locations throughout Melbourne and for culturally significant works to receive recognition for the purpose of preservation. Examples of street art pieces that have been added to the Victorian Heritage Register include: the 1983 mural outside the Aborigines Advancement League building, and a 1984 Keith Haring mural in Collingwood.\n\nThe Melbourne City Council acknowledged the difficulties that hinder the preservation of street art, with their graffiti management plan for 2014–18 stating: \"Protection of street art is not practical. The only exception may be especially commissioned works\".\n\n\nThe Melbourne Stencil Festival was Australia's premier celebration of international street and stencil art. Since its inauguration in 2004 the festival has become an annual event, touring regional Victoria and other locations within Australia. The festival was held for 10 days each year, involving exhibitions, live demonstrations, artist talks, panel discussions, workshops, master classes and street art related films to the general public. It featured works by emerging and established artists from both Australia and around the world.\n\nSince its inception, the Stencil Festival featured some 800 works by over 150 artists, many of whom were experiencing their first major art exhibition, finding it difficult to be exhibited in major commercial galleries reluctant to display emerging art forms. The first Melbourne Stencil Festival was held in a former sewing factory in North Melbourne in 2004. The three-day exhibition attracted spectator numbers far beyond expectations.\n\n\nAn event in which the entire iconic Hosier lane was repainted by over 150 artists. Produced by Invurt, Just Another Agency and Land Of Sunshine in conjunction with the National Gallery of Victoria. It ran between 27 – 29 November 2013.\n\n\n\nOther Australian cities:\n\nMedia\n\nConcepts\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4224083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4224083", "title": "Stuckism in Australia", "text": "Stuckism in Australia\n\nStuckism is an art movement that began in London, England, in 1999. In 2000, Melbourne artist Regan Tamanui started the first international branch of the movement. As of 2010, there are seven Australian Stuckist groups, who have held shows—sometimes concurrently with UK activities—received coverage in the Australian press and on TV, and also been represented in UK shows. The Stuckists take a strong pro-painting and anti-conceptual art stance, and were co-founded by Charles Thomson and Billy Childish.\n\nIn October 2000, Regan Tamanui founded the Melbourne Stuckists, the fourth Stuckist group to be started and the first one outside the UK (there are now 127 groups in 32 countries). On 27 October, he staged the \"Real Turner Prize Show\" at the Dead End Gallery in his home, concurrent with three shows with the same title in England (London, Falmouth and Dartington), and one in Germany, in protest against the Tate Gallery's Turner Prize.\n\nBesides Tamanui, the other initial members were Justin Grub, Ben Blanchette, Malcome Mmackie and Dave Freeman Rose. A subsequent line-up was Basil Kouvelis, Justin Grubb, Ben Frost, Nigel Stein, Daniel Gorzadek, Stephen Sperling and Dennis Roper. Stein, an RMIT art student, was prompted to join the group after Karen Ward was given the inaugural $105,000 Helen Lempriere Award for her minimal sculpture \"The Hut\", derided by him as a \"Wendy House\". Tamanui said, \"There are some people who shit in a tin. Is that really art?\"\n\nIn May 2001 Tamanui, Stein, Grubb and Kouvelis were represented with 24 international groups in the London show \"Vote Stuckist\", so named because Thomson was standing as a candidate in the United Kingdom general election, 2001, as a Stuckist candidate against the then-Culture Secretary, Chris Smith. \n\nIn November the Melbourne Stuckists staged a show \"Houdini to Hofmann\" at the Chiara Goya Gallery, which included some UK Stuckist work for the first time. \n\nKaye Blum made a short documentary on the group, \"Art Gets Unstuck-Up\". The film is structured around the artists reading lines from the Stuckists Manifesto written by Thomson and Childish. It was first shown at the \"Jaffas Down the Aisle\" film festival in Melbourne in October 2001, then in 2002 at the \"International Film Festival of Fine Art\" in Hungary and the \"Asolo Arts Film Festival\" in Italy, where it was nominated for best student short. \n\nIn 2001, Graham Wilson, born and bred in Gunnedah, New South Wales, founded the second Australian group (and the first Stuckist sculpture group), the Newcastle Stuckist Stonecarvers. \nIn December 2001, The Stuckist demonstration outside the Turner Prize at Tate Britain, London, was broadcast on Australian national TV news.\n\nIn 2002, Godfrey Blow started the Perth Stuckists (Western Australia). In July, along with Melbourne Stuckists he was shown at \"The First Stuckist International\", which opened in the Stuckism Gallery, Shoreditch, London. \n\nIn March 2003, Tamanui was exhibited in \"Stuck in Wednesbury\", the Stuckists' first show in a public gallery, held in Wednesbury Museum and Art Gallery, England.\nIn October 2002, Tamanui opened the Stuckism International Centre (Australia) with an ongoing exhibition of work, as well as the first international Stuckist show in Australia, \"Stuck Down South\", at the FAD Gallery. This included founding Stuckists, Charles Thomson, Ella Guru and Sexton Ming. (Like the London gallery it has now ceased operating.)\n\nIn September 2004, Blow exhibited in the movement's first major show in a national museum, \"The Stuckists Punk Victorian\" at the Walker Art Gallery during the Liverpool Biennial. He returned for the next Biennial there in 2006 to participate in \"The Triumph of Stuckism\" show and symposium at 68 Hope Street Gallery.\n\nThe Australian presence was first noted in an article on the Stuckists in the UK \"Observer\" Sunday newspaper in May 2000.\n\nThe participation of the Australian Stuckists in the London \"Vote Stuckist\" show occasioned a double page spread by Gabriella Coslovich in the leading Melbourne paper The Age. It revealed a similar range of reactions to the ones the UK group had received in Britain. Melbourne painter David Larwill said, \"It's the best thing I've heard in ages.\" Max Delaney, director of public gallery 200 Gertrude Street, accused the group of \"revisionism\" and \"publicity and marketing\". Su Baker, head of the School of Art, Victorian College of the Arts, wrote it off as \"a cheap shot\" (the same accusation which Sir Nicholas Serota had levelled at Thomson in London. In July Stein repeated the same debate on \"Coast to Coast\", Channel 2 (ABC TV). \nIn February 2003, Tracey Emin was interviewed in \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" while in Australia:\n\nIn August 2003, Australian performance artist Stelarc's plan to have a human ear grafted onto his forearm drew virulent criticism from UK Stuckists. Melbourne Stuckist, Nigel Stein, said, \"Personally, I have been an admirer of Stelarc's work for about 10 years. I would be really interested in seeing the outcome.\"\n\nThe same month, Kouvelis and Thomson were interviewed on ABC Radio National Australia by Francis Leach. In June 2004 Childish (who left the group in 2002) was interviewed on ABC Radio National Australia. \n\nIn October 2004 an article, \"Breaking New Ground\", appeared in the Hills Gazette, Kalamunda, Western Australia, outlining Blow's involvement in the Stuckist movement and representation at the \"Stuckist Punk Victorian\" exhibition at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool.\n\nIn April 2005 \"The Age\" ran a reprise of Stuckism and observed: \nIn July 2005, \"State of the Arts\" Australian art magazine gave a survey on the UK and Australian Stuckists, and found:\n\nIn December 2005, the Stuckists demonstrated about the Tate Gallery's purchase of their trustee Chris Ofili's work, \"The Upper Room\", wearing monkey and elephant masks, outside the Turner Prize at Tate Britain in London. A syndicated report covered the demonstration in \"The Sydney Morning Herald\", \"The Age\", Yahoo Australia, \"ABC News Online\", \"SBS\", \"Seven\" and \"The Australian\". In June 2006 Blow supported the campaign with message board posts.\n\n\nThe Stuckists were founded in the United Kingdom by Charles Thomson and Billy Childish with ten other artists in 1999 to oppose conceptual art and champion painting as the radical medium of self-discovery. The name was derived by Thomson from an insult by Tracey Emin to her ex-boyfriend Childish that he was \"stuck\", which he had recorded in a poem. The Stuckists have since become an accepted part of the UK art scene and are studied in the educational system, but still remain largely ostracised by the art establishment for their stringent criticisms of it, particularly of the Britart, the Saatchi Gallery and the Turner Prize. They have also launched the period of \nRemodernism—\"A renewal of spirituality and meaning in art, culture and society\".\n\nAn earlier group of seven artists in Australia (six of them Melbourne based) called the Antipodeans Group also issued a manifesto to promote modern figurative painting in opposition to the prevailing orthodoxy, which at that time was Abstract Expressionism. This was launched in a show of the artists in Melbourne in August 1959. They stated that figurative art \"communicates because it has the capacity to refer to experiences that the artist shares with his audience\", and that \"the image, the recognizable shape, the meaningful symbol, is the basic unit of the artists' language\". Like the Stuckists they were accused of conservatism and reaction.\n\n\n\n"}
