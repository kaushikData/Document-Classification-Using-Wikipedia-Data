It is the author's first book of fiction. Two of the stories were adapted into films: the title story and \"The Princess of Nebraska\", both directed by Wayne Wang.\n\nGranny Lin, a fifty-one-year-old spinster, struggles to find work after she is \"honorably retired\" from a Beijing garment factory and is denied a pension. Her colleague Auntie Wang recommends that she get married so she can be financially secure with an inheritance. She reluctantly agrees to be matched with Old Tang, a seventy-six year old widower struggling with Alzheimer's disease. Once she is married to him, she has to pretend that Old Tang's previous wife is still alive but ill at the hospital. One day, while they are bathing, Old Tang insists that his previous wife is still alive and, in a fit of passion, tussles with Granny Lin; during their scuffle, he slips and subsequently dies.\n\nAfter the funeral, in which she refuses to accept any inheritance out go guilt, one of Old Tang's sons recommends her for a job as a maid at the Mei-Mei Academy, a primary boarding school in the mountainous western suburb of Beijing. There, she develops a bond with Kang, a newly-arrived, six-year-old student. She learns that his father is a wealthy agricultural entrepreneur, but Kang is sent away because he is the child the first, now-divorced wife of the tycoon. Because no one comes for him on the weekends, he and Granny Lin bond with each other at the school, taking walks and telling stories during this time until the school week resumes.\n\nMonths into her employment, complaints of missing girls' sock arise; Granny Lin knows that Kang is the thief but does not report him. Instead, she goes on a search for them, finding them in him pillowcase. Instead of returning them, she leaves them alone and goes to the city to buy similar socks and mixes them back into the girls' laundry. When Kang's roommate tries to play a prank of him in the middle of the night, he notices Kang stroking his cheeks with his hands gloved with the socks; this results in the entire school alienating Kang. One weekend, Kang decides to hide indefinitely, causing a scare and Granny Lin involves the authorities. Shortly after Kang reveals himself, Granny Lin is dismissed. While walking through the city, a thief snatches her duffel bag and runs off; however, she has lost little, as she has placed he severance pay and extra girls' socks in her lunch pail.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Su, elderly, married first-cousins who live together in Beijing, take care of their twenty-eight year old daughter Beibei who has mental retardation and cerebral palsy. While having breakfast, they receive a call from Mrs. Fong, who suspects that her husband is having an affair; Mrs. Su assures her that Mr. Fong is having breakfast with Mr. Su and he leaves to go to the stockbrokerage.\n\nA year prior, Mr. Su and Mr. Fong met each other while trading. A month after their meeting, Mr. Fong confessed that he was seeing a woman in her forties while Mrs. Fong was in prison for money laundering. After Mr. Fong is comforted, he loans Mr. Su some money indefinitely for investing.\n\nMrs. Fong, who was released early due to deteriorating health, calls again to tell Mrs. Su that she will hire a detective to find out if Mr. Fong is seeing another woman. Initially, Mrs. Su worries about Mr. Su getting caught between the crossfires of implication, but then Beibei takes her attention away from Mrs. Fong. As she cares for Beibei, she is struck with nostalgia. The Sus fell in love when they were young and had gone against everyone when they married and had Beibei. Ten years later, they tried to normalized their lives by having another child, Jian, who was born without complications.\n\nWhile working at the stockbrokerage, Mr. Su ruminates about how he tried to test fate by having Beibei. Jian was supposed to bring them closer, but their happiness declined even more. After finishing his work at the firm that day, he find a drunk Mr. Fong; Mr. Su decides to bring his woozy friend to his house. Meanwhile, after having given Beibei sleep medicine, Mrs. Su receives another call; Mrs. Fong tells of how Mr. Fong confessed to her and recommended that the paramour live with them as a second wife to which Mrs. Fong responded with outrage. After Mr. Su helps Mr. Fong fall asleep on the couch and Mrs. Su starts to ignore Mrs. Fong, the Sus head to Beibei's room to examine her; Mrs. Su holds her hand as Mr. Su strokes her hair.\n\nFor generations, a small village has consistently produced Great Papas for the imperial families of Dynastic China. When imperial rule ends and the Communist party takes control of the nation, the village falls out of favor with the ruling power and loses its reputation.\n\nDuring a nationwide famine, a boy tries to steal a sparrow for his sick mother; one of the villager castigates him for this. When the others realizes that the boy bares the face of the dictator, they let him take as many birds as he wants. During his upbringing, the villagers pay keen attention to keeping him out of harm's way, fearing injury to him will cause them bad luck; however, they also refuse to interact with him, especially keen to keeping their daughters away from him. After the dictator's death, the community goes into a state of mourning, not hearing from the boy (who is now a young man) for years.\n\nOne day, when he is in his late twenties, he leaves the village via car for the capital. After many auditions followed by trials, the young man is selected as the dictator's impersonator, starring in films and becoming a recognizable celebrity. When the young man is in his forties and western influences enter the nation's conscience, he begins to doubt his role. Prior, he was a virgin who saw himself too \"great\" for a woman's body; after reading a biography of the dictator, he begins to incessantly crave sex. As a result, he attempts to secretly fulfill his desires with a prostitute; however, the pimp sets-up the young man, taking embarrassing photographs of him and threatening to release it to the public unless he pays a king's ransom. The young man refuses, and after the photographs' release, he is disgracefully discharged by the party.\n\nWhen the young man returns to the village, he ignores all the greetings from the villagers and heads straight for his mother's grave. There, he \"cleans\" himself, but survives the bleeding and subsequently lives the rest of his life in the village.\n\nSasha, a half-Chinese, half-Mongolian international student, takes a Greyhound with Boshen, a friend of her fetus' father, from Nebraska to Chicago to get an abortion.\n\nIn China, Boshen is a gay doctor who advocated for AIDS awareness when he meets Yang, a Nan Dan (also the father of Sasha's fetus). After Yang is expelled from the Peking Opera for his homosexuality, he starts working as a prostitute. Boshen pays for Yang's services and eventually they start a relationship, despite there being a huge age gap. One night at a party, Yang meets Sasha and they become acquainted. Despite knowing that she will leave for the United States for graduate school soon, she starts an affair with Yang; one night, near the end of their relationship, she is impregnated by him when they have intercourse without a condom.\n\nBoshen insist that Sasha contact Yang once more before going through with the abortion to see if he want to join her in the states. She reveals that she had tried but Yang was reluctant. As the two watch the winter holiday parade, the fetus kicks, and Sasha thinks about what it would mean to be a mother.\n\nSansan and Tu, childhood friends from the same town, end up going to the same university in Beijing; there, they meet Min, a student activist who participants in the Tiananmen Square demonstrations who is also Sansan's dormmate. Sansan and Tu get better acquainted because they are the only two students in their collective friends circle that do not demonstrate; eventually, they become engaged. After the crackdown by the government, only students with relatives in the United States can study abroad there. Sansan, feeling pity for the government backlash against Min, tells Tu (who supposedly has an uncle living in the states) to marry Min and takes her with him during his graduate studies in Pennsylvania, with the promise to divorce Min and return to Beijing after Min is sponsored in the states. Even though Tu suggests that he and Sansan have sex before his departure, she refuses, citing a passage from \"Women in Love\" about how doing so will make him crave other women more. Despite their promise, Tu falls in love with Min and does not return. \n\nTen years later, Sansan becomes an English teacher in Beijing and regularly shows \"Casablanca\" to her students. One day, her mother shows up at the school to inform her that Tu has recently divorced Min and wants to marry Sansan. Later that day, after ruminating on the past, Sansan goes to confront her mother in the marketplace, who works there as an egg vendor. They argue about Tu's proposal and Sansan ultimately tells her mother that she is no long interested in Tu. Her mother responds by citing that since she is no longer a virgin, no man wants to marry her, reiterating the town's belief that she and Tu did have sex before he left. Some time later, a uncouthly-dressed man enters the marketplace with a sign reading: \"Give me ten yuan and I will let you slice me once wherever you like; if you finish my life with one cut, you owe me nothing.\" A crowd gathers around him. Sansan's mother, thinking the man a beggar, gives the man ten yuan and he holds a knife to her; she refuses to touch it. He subsequently returns the money. Sansan takes the money, gives it to the man, takes the knife, and slashes him on the shoulder, finally finding someone she \"loves.\"\n\nHan, a thirty-three-year-old gay man, returns to Beijing on vacation from the United States to see his mother. Instead of matchmaking for him as she usually does, she gives him gold jewelry and asks him to go to church with her. That request repulses him, as he does not value religion. The next day when they go to church, he opts out, but before waiting for his mother at the nearby Starbucks, a boy and a girl in rags asks Han and his mother for money. She offers the children money to accompany her to church, but Han counters by offering double the amount if they do not go inside. The children take Han's offer, leave, and his mother goes inside. While Han waits, he notices an automobile accident in the periphery but does not go to look, fearing it could involve the children he gave money to before. When he mother comes out, he tells her that he is gay, thinking that she will despise him, but she instead tells him that she loves him for who he is.\n\nYoung Ruolan learns from her godfather-like Uncle Bing that her parents married each other knowing both had secrets that would make a happy marriage impossible. Her mother is a \"stone woman,\" and her father loves an older widow; their marriage was an \"arrangement\" for both of them. After many years of living apart but still remaining legally married, her father asks for a divorce, to which her mother says that he will have to take her to court. \n\nRuolan is indifferent to much of divorce. Knowing the he is in love with her mother, whe asks Uncle Bing to run away with her telling him \"that what a mother owes, a daughter pays back.\" He refuses, citing that her mother needs her now more than ever due to her failing health.\n\nA young girl nicknamed \"Little Blossom\" stays with family friends, the Pangs, for a week every summer and winter in a quadrangle in Beijing. There she gets to be more free and bonds with the people in the house, including both Mr. Pang and Mrs. Pang. She learns of their secrets which she remembers fondly of until the day they are both passed.\n\nLao Da, a widow whose son was killed in a drowning \"accident,\" kills seventeen people he feels were responsible for the incident. Members of his community weigh-in on his motive and the justification of the incident; most agree that while his actions are extreme, they are justified given the current corrupt system that took Lao Da's \"softness like a persimmon\" for granted.\n\nMr. Shi, a retired \"rocket scientist,\" goes to visit his daughter in the United States. During his trip, he meets an elderly Iranian woman who he converses with about his life. He tells the woman about how he is concerned about his daughter who has recently divorced her husband of seven years. He also talks with his daughter about the matter and how he will not leave under she \"recovers.\" When a phone call comes from his daughter's Romanian lover, they have an argument about him, which ends when she insinuates his shameful past.\n\nMore than four decades ago, Mr. Shi, who was already married and had his two-year old daughter, fell in love the girl who punched time cards. After the higher-ups learned about the affair, he was relegated to menial work but still kept the title of \"rocket scientist\" and the affair remained a secret from his wife. As he finishes telling this story to the Iranian woman, he says, \"It is what we sacrifice that makes life meaningful.\"\n\nWriting in \"The Guardian\", Michel Faber notes that \"\"A Thousand Years of Good Prayers\" is the best possible revenge against the insular simple-mindedness that once ruled Chinese literature.\" Contributing to \"The New York Times\", Fatema Ahmed writes that \"Li is a valuable firsthand guide to this decade of mind-bending change\" and \"Li's ability to write about both her native and adoptive countries [...] makes her a skillful double agent.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "10791913", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10791913", "title": "Aval Appadithan", "text": "Aval Appadithan\n\nAval Appadithan () is a 1978 Indian Tamil-language drama film directed by C. Rudhraiya in his directorial debut, and co-written by him with Somasundareshwar. The film was produced by Ragamanjari in association with the M.G.R. Government Film and Television Training Institute. It stars Kamal Haasan, Rajinikanth, and Sripriya, while Ilaiyaraaja composed the film's music. The plot revolves around Manju (Sripriya) and the difficulties she faces in her life, due to her romantic relationships, resulting in her developing an aggressive and cynical nature towards men.\n\n\"Aval Appadithan\" was released on 30 October 1978, on Diwali day. Although the film received positive critical reception, it was not a box office success at the time of its release. However, the film began to develop an audience after directors P. Bharathiraja and Mrinal Sen commented positively about it. The film was noted for its stylish filmmaking, screenplay, and dialogue, a large portion of it being in English.\n\n\"Aval Appadithan\" was the first film made by a graduate of the M.G.R. Government Film and Television Training Institute, facilitating students of film technology to achieve success in the field of cinema. The film received the second prize for Best Film at the 1978 Tamil Nadu State Film Awards, while Nallusamy and M. N. Gnanashekharan won the Best Cinematographer award. Additionally, Sripriya received a Special Award for the Best Actress of 1978. In 2013, CNN-News18 included the film in its list, \"The 100 greatest Indian films of all time\".\n\nManju (Sripriya) was raised in a dysfunctional family that consisted of a timid father and a philandering mother; she hurtles from one disastrous affair to another, leading to her degenerating into a cynical woman. Into her life enter two radically different men. One of them is her boss, Thyagu (Rajinikanth), who owns the advertising agency she works for. He is a stereotype of the successful man: money-minded, opinionated, arrogant, and a male chauvinist. In sharp contrast is Arun (Kamal Haasan), who has come to Chennai from Coimbatore to make a documentary on women. Sensitive and sincere, he believes his job has a purpose and is both shocked and amused at the cynical attitudes of Manju and Thyagu.\n\nManju has been drafted by Thyagu to assist Arun in his documentary. As Arun and Manju start working together, Arun begins to understand Manju's complex personality. She tells Arun about her unfortunate past relationships: How she was molested by her uncle, the ending of her first relationship in college when her lover left her by marrying another woman for the sake of employment, and how her second love, Mano (Sivachandran), a Christian priest's son, used her to satisfy his needs and lust, calling her \"sister\" in front of her parents. These incidents have led to her present attitude towards men. Arun later shares these conversations with Thyagu, who warns him to steer clear of such women.\n\nInevitably, Arun falls for Manju. However Manju incurs Thyagu's wrath when he overhears her reprimanding her office staff for commenting on her character. When Thyagu also comments about her, she resigns from her job. When he learns of this, Arun requests Thyagu to re-employ her. Thyagu simply laughs and says that she is already back, after which Manju seems to have a change of heart and starts courting Thyagu. Arun is devastated to see that she has turned out to be just the sort of woman that Thyagu earlier said she was opportunistic, money-minded, and fickle. When he asks her about her contradicting stands in life, she responds by saying that is the way she is and will be.\n\nThe truth finally emerges that Manju was merely baiting Thyagu to teach him a lesson. When Thyagu starts believing that Manju has fallen for him, he attempts to take advantage of her at a party banquet, but she rebukes and slaps him, after which Thyagu runs away in fright. However, this revelation comes too late for her, as Arun, who is disillusioned with her behaviour, has already married a small town girl (Saritha). When Manju tells her aunt about the attempt to humiliate Thyagu and its ramifications, her aunt tells Manju that she deserved it for leaving behind a golden opportunity to start a new life. In a final discussion in Thyagu's car, Manju asks Arun's wife, \"What do you think of women's liberation?\". Arun's wife replies, \"I don't know\". Manju replies with a cynical, \"that is why you are happy\". The film ends with Manju standing on the road as the car carrying Thyagu and the married couple pulls away from her. A voice-over says, \"She died today. She will be reborn tomorrow. She will die again. She will be reborn again. That is how she is\".\n\n\nC. Rudhraiya, whose former name was Aarumugam, was introduced to Kamal Haasan by writer and director Ananthu. The three shared an interest in the works of Robert Bresson, Jean-Luc Godard, Roman Polanski, and Roberto Rossellini. Godard and Bresson were part of the French New Wave, which focused on films based on social ideas, some of which were iconoclastic in nature. Rudhraiya, Haasan, and Ananthu wanted to experiment with their ideas in Tamil. This was Rudhraiya's first film as director; quite radical in his approach, he wanted to change the conventions of Tamil cinema at that time. K. Rajeshwar was writing a script dealing with women's liberation at that time, and it was decided that his script would be used for the film; the result was \"Aval Appadithan\". The initial script by Rajeshwar consisted of two pages.\n\n\"Aval Appadithan\" was the debut film for both Nallusamy and M. N. Gnanashekaran, who jointly handled the film's cinematography. Vanna Nilavan co-wrote the screenplay with Somasundareshwar and Rudhraiya. The film was co-produced by Ragamanjari, in association with the students of the M.G.R. Government Film and Television Training Institute. Sripriya, who played Manju, was initially unsure about acting in the film due to her busy schedule at that time, and only agreed to do it on Haasan's insistence. According to Rajeshwar, the characterisation of Manju was inspired from a woman he met and who had similar radical beliefs. In \"\" (2012), Rajinikanth recalled, \"if Kamal had said, “Don’t cast Rajini”, nobody would have taken me [in \"Aval Appadithaan\"].\" Sivachandran was cast as Manju's former lover Mano.\n\nThroughout the film, the cinematography made extensive use of shadows and close up shots to emphasise the moods of the characters. Jump cuts were frequently used as well. Overall, 8,230 metres of film negative was used to make the film, and the team incurred a cost of 20,000 for exterior shooting equipment. The scenes where Arun interviewed women for his documentary were real scenes, improvised with women they would meet at colleges and bus stops, and shot using the live-recording method. The film uses a sharp contrast of black and white colours to lend a surreal atmosphere to it, and none of the actors used make-up.\n\nFilming proceeded smoothly as almost all of the dialogues were ready by the time team went for filming the scenes. The camera angles were pre-planned as well. Haasan shot the film in his spare time, as he was involved in over 20 other films as an actor during the production of \"Aval Appadithan\". Before a shot, Haasan discussed the scene with Ananthu and Rudhraiya on how Godard would have done it. The film was shot in two-hour sessions over a period of four-five months. The opening scene where Haasan looks into the camera and says \"Konjam left-la ukaarunga\" (English: \"Sit a little to the left, please.\") was meant as a sign to the audience to support gender equality. According to the Tamil newspaper \"Dinamalar\", \"Aval Appadithan\" was shot in 20 days.\n\n\"Aval Appadithan\" explores a number of themes such as women's liberation, sex and the chauvinistic attitude of males. Its central theme is on women and their plight in society, as exemplified by Manju and her relationships. Born to a timid father and a mother with loose moral values, she is also subsequently affected by two people she becomes romantically involved with. One, her college mate, left her to marry someone else for the sake of a job; and the second is Mano, the son of a Christian priest, who used her to satisfy his lust and then trivialised their relationship by calling her \"sister\" in front of her parents. These relationships result in her becoming wary of men and developing an aggressive nature towards them. Conversations related to matters like the status of women in contemporary (1978) times and the nature of humankind are frequently seen in the film.\n\nSociologist Selvaraj Velayutham says in his book, \"Tamil Cinema: The Cultural Politics of India's Other Film Industry\", that Manju's characterisation was \"brought out entirely verbally by her\". Velayutham believes the film to be constantly resorting to \"existing myths about women and relationships: that a wayward mother destroys her children; that a woman who speaks the 'truth' is always alone; that men are scared of her; that the woman who is different is confused, not sure of herself and is only seeking love from a man but does not know it herself.\" Velayutham further asserts that the film's only positive aspect is \"it does not expose the body of women in the way it is customary\" and that Manju could have avoided her unfortunate set of circumstances \"if only she had a 'proper' mother!\"\n\nArtist V. Jeevananthan compared \"Aval Appadithan\" to other films whose central theme was women, such as \"Charulata\" (1964), \"Aval Oru Thodar Kathai\" (1974), and \"Panchagni\" (1986), while also labelling them as \"classics that put the spotlight on women.\" Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen, in their book \"Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema\", say the film was also inspired by the 1972 film, \"Dhakam\", which starred R. Muthuraman and Pandari Bai. They also note that \"Aval Appadithan\" uses a \"fluid narrative style\" and music to mix flashbacks with vox-pop and \"glossy pictorialism\". The film is an exception on stereotypes of women, as shown by paralleling an independent woman, Manju, and a pious traditional woman: Manju gets into problems while Arun's wife is happy. The last lines of the film where Manju asks \"what do you think of 'women's liberation'\", Arun's wife answers, \"I don't know\", to which Manju says \"that is why you are happy\", send the message that one will inevitably get into trouble if one exhibits assertive behaviour.\n\nKamal Haasan's character, Arun, is an early version of a metrosexual male sensitive and sincere. Rajinikanth's character, Thyagu, is the exact opposite of Arun money-minded, arrogant, and a womaniser. This is evident when Thyagu says to Arun: \"Women should be enjoyed, not analysed.\" According to Rajinikanth, Thyagu was very much similar to him in real life — he too smokes and drinks, but applies \"vibhuti\" (sacred ash) on his forehead. This implies that Thyagu was also an atheist. According to film critic Naman Ramachandran, Thyagu was, by far, Rajinikanth's most entertaining character up to that point in his career; his character was a self-confessed chauvinist who believed that men and women can never be equal, and that women are merely objects to be used for men's pleasure. When Arun calls Thyagu \"a prejudiced ass\", Thyagu responds by saying, \"I am a male ass,\" with the dialogue being in English. His opinion of Sripriya's character, Manju, is seen when he says (also in English), \"She is a self pitying sex-starved bitch!\"\n\n\"Aval Appadithan\" soundtrack and score were composed by Ilaiyaraaja. The soundtrack was released under the label of EMI Records. Although Ilaiyaraaja was busy, he agreed to compose for \"Aval Appadithan\" at the insistence of Rudhraiya and Haasan.\n\nAfter the recording session of \"Ninaivo Oru Paravai\" from the film, \"Sigappu Rojakkal\" (1978), Ilaiyaraaja asked Haasan to record \"Panneer Pushpangale\" that same afternoon. During the recording session, Ilaiyaraaja suggested that Haasan tone down the opening notes; when Haasan sang perfectly as per his suggestion, Ilaiyaraaja accepted Haasan's next rendition of the song. The song \"Uravugal Thodarkathai\" was reused in the film \"Megha\" (2014). Ilaiyaraaja wanted Vannanilavan to write the lyrics for the song, since Vannanilavan had difficulties in writing the lyrics, he opted out. He was subsequently replaced with Gangai Amaran.\n\nThe soundtrack received positive reviews from critics. B. Kolappan of \"The Hindu\" wrote, \"If the song \"Uravugal Thodarkathai\" poignantly captures the vulnerable moments in the life of a woman, \"Panneer Pushpangale\" and \"Vaazhkai Odam Chella\" in \"Aval Appadithan\" are known for their melody and philosophical touch.\" According to Swarnavel Eswaran Pillai, author of the article \"The 1970s Tamil cinema and the post-classical turn\", Ilaiyaraaja's songs were used \"to punctuate the interiority of the characters rather than as a spectacle or as a device to move the plot forward.\"\n\n\"Aval Appadithan\" was released on 30 October 1978, on Diwali day. Awarded an \"A\" (adults only) certificate by the Central Board of Film Certification for its bold dialogue and subject matter, this led to the film initially struggling to find a distributor. After it was shown to several distributors and exhibitors, the Safire Theatre Group finally agreed to screen the film as a one-print, one theatre release.\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics. On 19 November 1978, the magazine \"Ananda Vikatan\" criticised the gaps in the film, particularly the abundance of English dialogue, the excessive focus on naturalism, and lower standard of technical work (especially the cinematography). Despite these perceived flaws, the magazine still appreciated the film, stating that the actors immersed themselves into their characters, leading to them not really acting before the camera but living the characters. K. Balamurugan of Rediff said, \"It was what we would call parallel cinema these days.\"\n\nWriting for \"The Hindu\", Baradwaj Rangan said, \"\"Aval Appadithan\" was different. The shadowy black-and-white cinematography was different. The dialogues, which were more about revealing character than advancing plot, were different. The frank handling of sex and profanity ('she is a self-pitying, sex-starved bitch!') was different. The documentary-like detours were different. The painfully sensitive, feminist hero was different. Rudraiah was different.\" Another critic from \"The Hindu\", B. Kolappan, called the performances of the lead cast \"excellent\". D. Karthikeyan of \"The Hindu\" wrote in December 2009 that \"Aval Appadithan\" would \"remain etched in every film lover's memory by showing the best of Rajnikanth's acting skills.\" Director Mrinal Sen remarked, \"The film was far ahead of its times.\" Critics also appreciated the live-recording method of shooting the sequences where Haasan's character, Arun, interviewed women for his documentary.\n\nThe film did not initially receive a big response from the public, and was not a box office success upon its release. However, after the directors P. Bharathiraja and Mrinal Sen wrote positive comments on it, people began to watch the film and appreciate it, leading \"Aval Appadithan\" to develop a cult following. In November 2014, Haasan defended the financial failure of the film, \"\"Aval Appadithan\" was a guerilla attack on the industry by insiders like me. It slipped through their fingers, so to speak. With all the attention that films get these days, I doubt we can get away with such a film any more.\"\n\nThe film was awarded the Second Prize for Best Film at the 1978 Tamil Nadu State Film Awards. At the same ceremony, Nallusamy and M. N. Gnanashekharan won the award for Best Cinematographer, and Sripriya received a Special Award for Best Actress of the year.\n\n\"Aval Appadithan\" is one of only two films ever directed by Rudhraiya; the other was \"Gramathu Athiyayam\" (1980). \"Aval Appadithan\" was noted for its stylish filmmaking, screenplay and dialogue, a large portion of it being in English. The dialogues were sharp and were considered almost vulgar. It also broke the style of filmmaking followed up until that time. It was the first film made by a graduate from the M.G.R. Government Film and Television Training Institute, facilitating Indian film technology students to achieve success in the film industry. Sripriya included it in her list of favourite films she had worked in. Rudhraiya's daughter, Ganga, noted that \"Aval Appadithan\" help her face life in the real world.\n\nIn a July 2004 interview with T. Saravanan of \"The Hindu\", director Karu Pazhaniappan rated \"Aval Appadithan\" as one of the best films he had ever seen. In May 2007, K. Balamurugan of Rediff included \"Aval Appadithan\" in his list of \"Rajni's Tamil Top 10\". In July 2007, S. R. Ashok Kumar of \"The Hindu\" asked eight Tamil film directors to list their all-time favourite Tamil films; two of them – Balu Mahendra and Ameer – named \"Aval Appadithan\". Thiagarajan Kumararaja named \"Aval Appadithan\" as an inspiration for his film \"Aaranya Kaandam\" (2011). S. Shiva Kumar of \"The Hindu\" included the film on his December 2010 list of \"Electrifying Rajinikanth-Kamal Haasan films\" with \"Moondru Mudichu\" (1976), \"Avargal\" (1977) and \"16 Vayathinile\" (1977). In April 2013, CNN-News18 included the film in its list, \"The 100 greatest Indian films of all time\". In June 2013, A. Muthusamy of Honey Bee Music enhanced the songs from their original version on the film's soundtrack album to 5.1 surround sound. In July 2013, Sruti Harihara Subramanian, founder and trustee of The Cinema Resource Centre (TCRC), told Janani Sampath of \"The New Indian Express\" that many people assumed the film was directed by K. Balachander, not by Rudhraiya. Sruti also has an album of promotional stills and photographs of the film's production.\n\nIn November 2013, \"The New Indian Express\" included the film in its list, \"Kamal Haasan's most underrated films\". In February 2014, CNN-News18 included \"Aval Appadithan\" in its list, titled \"12 Indian films that would make great books\". In \"Kathai Thiraikathai Vasanam Iyakkam\" (2014), the hero's writing team discusses the theme of \"Aval Appadithan\" to get ideas for their film's story, until they realise that the film was a failure at the time of its release. Indo-Asian News Service, in their review of Sripriya's directorial venture \"Malini 22 Palayamkottai\" (2014), a film about a rape victim, stated, \"Sripriya, who was once a successful actress, played a rape victim in Tamil drama \"Aval Appadithan\". It's probably because of that role and the effect it had left on her, she handles this subject with great care and understanding that most of her peers would lack.\" In January 2015, K. Rajeshwar said, \"I was told that if \"Aval Appadithan\" were made today, it would be a blockbuster. I don’t agree, for it’s still taboo for a woman to talk about her sexual encounters. The profile of the audience should change.\" In July 2016, \"The Hindu\" included \"Aval Appadithan\" in its list of \"roles that defined Rajinikanth the actor\".\n\n"}

Her work focuses on the issues of feminism and gender roles within a Latin American context. It has been praised by a number of writers, including Carlos Fuentes, Alma Guillermoprieto, Roberto Bolaño and Elena Poniatowska, as well as publications such as \"Publishers Weekly\". Her work has been studied by academics in several countries (dissertations \nAlso a dozen books have been published on her work. Reviews of her books have appeared on several countries and languages . \n\nCarmen Boullosa was born on September 4, 1954 in Mexico City, Mexico.\n\nBoullosa has published eighteen novels. Though all different from one another, on theme and form, Boullosa´s style has s distinctive personality.\n\nOne of her novels, \"Son vacas, somos puercos\" (1991, translated into English in 1997 as \"They're Cows, We're Pigs\") is narrated in the first person by an old man looking back on his life. He was kidnapped and sent from his native France on a slave ship to the West Indies at the age of thirteen. To gain his freedom, he joins a group of pirates (or \"pigs\"), allowing Boullosa to compare two very different societal and political systems—traditional Europe and carefree pirates. In \"La milagrosa\", a novel written in 1993, the protagonist is a girl who has the power to heal the sick and perform other miracles while she sleeps. She falls in love with Aurelio Jimenez, a detective sent to discredit her, even though she fears that her powers will disappear if she spends time with people. It ends ambiguously, leaving an unsolved murder without closure. \"Duerme\", another popular work published in 1995, tells the story of Claire, a French woman whose mother was a prostitute. Attempting to escape the same profession, she arrives in Spain dressed as a man. To save a subject of the Spanish king, she reveals herself as a female and prepares to take his punishment of death by hanging. Beforehand, however, she is wounded in the left breast and her blood is replaced by water from the lakes of Mexico City. The water's magical powers make it possible for her to survive the punishment.\n\nBoullosa is also well known for her \"Teatro herético\" (1987), a compilation of three parodies in play format—\"Aura y las once mil vírgenes\", \"Cocinar hombres\", and \"Propusieron a María\". The first tells the story of a man called by God to \"deflower\" eleven thousand virgins in his life, so that heaven's overpopulation problem might be addressed, since the women will have to wait in purgatory for a time. The man then uses his sexual encounters as material for his television commercials and becomes a successful advertising agent. \"Cocinar hombres\" tells the story of two girls who find themselves to have become young adult witches overnight, so as to fly over the earth tempting but not satisfying men. Finally, the third play satirically recounts the conversation between Joseph and Mary before Mary gives birth to Jesus and ascends to heaven.\n\nBoullosa has two children—María Aura and Juan Aura—with her former partner, Alejandro Aura—and is now married to author Mike Wallace.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Reynolds, Smith & Hills, a firm in Jacksonville, Florida, produced managing software designed to organize an array of financials that could help identify a successful development investment strategy. This application was limited to financial analysis and marked the first phase of computer application in architecture. In 1971, Willis and Associates innovated the computer’s spatial analysis capacities for application in architectural and land planning practices, foreshadowing the eventual development of computer-aided design and mapping programs in architecture and urban planning. CARLA was able to produce in a twenty-day period what by traditional methods and analyses would achieve in four to six months, allowing land development and construction to take place more rapidly. This was an important consideration in the 1970s when rates of inflation were rising and construction delays could introduce significant cost increases. CARLA could process “500% more information in 400% less time and at 40% of the cost generated by utilizing the more traditional methods.”\n\nCARLA was a customized software program conceived by Beverly Willis and written in house by a Harvard Graduate School of Design student, Jochen Eigen, designed to analyze prospective land parcels for their development potential as large-scale multi-unit complexes. Jochen Eigen wrote the programming scripts that directed CARLA as the managing software to interface a variety of planning unit concepts with a mapping program that could then process a variety of planning proposals against the site’s fixed fields of relevant data. The data was extracted from traditional analog topographical maps soil analysis, and marketing information.\n\nOnce the physical characteristics were entered into CARLA, the computer could generate contour perspectives of the site from any point plotted along an x, y, x axis and help identify areas of common building suitability, natural drainage patterns slope analysis and areas requiring cut and fill. Using the CARLA grid as a structural template, multiple planning unit concepts were introduced and profiled against the site’s fixed characteristics and CARLA would then determine what plan, how many building units and of what variety could be successfully integrated into designated areas within the site. These tests were repeated until a match that produced environmentally and economically sound results was identified.\n\nThe computer graphic information reports were represented either in the form of topographical site perspectives, contour maps or as a sequence of numeric values organized within a template matrix that allowed the architect to identify the optimal relationships and planning concept. This work then became the basis for presentation materials that were used to introduce the client/developer to the proposed designs.\n\nIn 1976, Willis & Associates was awarded a federal building commission from the General Services Administration (GSA) in Washington, D.C., representing the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and administered by the GSA office in Kansas City, Missouri. The project was conceived by the IRS as a prototype design that would be site-adapted for nine subsequent buildings in IRS regions across the country. The Computer Center Building was part of an $800 million dollar program to automate tax returns at tax processing campuses servicing different IRS regions nationwide. Willis & Associates’ program CARLA provided the technical knowledge required for the IRS Computer Center Building.\n\nIn 1974, Willis & Associates, Inc., was awarded an architectural and engineering contract for the design and plan of the Aliamanu Valley Community for Military Housing in Honolulu, Hawaii. The project was a $110 million complex of 11,500 inhabitants, residing in 525 buildings on a 524-acre site. It was the first joint family housing venture in Hawaii. The community consisted of an Army-Navy complex of 2,600 family apartments: 1,600 Army apartments, 800 Navy apartments, and 200 for the Marine Corps.\n\nThough CARLA had been previously used in designing multi-housing complexes on challenging sites, the Aliamanu site presented a greater challenge due to a non-active volcanic crater floor in a one hundred year old flood plain of clay. Fundamental to the development of an economical land-use plan for Aliamanu was the firm’s belief that the “best site plans are those that least disturb the land, that preserve the natural drainage channels and minimize need to cut and fill.” Land planning decisions were based on the principle−Less construction means less destruction. CARLA’s analyses allowed for less earth-moving for the project, causing less destruction to the environment and lowering overall construction costs.\n"}

It is known for its pottery and handicrafts. The village name Dan Kwian means toll station or check point (\"Dan\") for oxcarts (\"Kwian\").\n\nDan Kwian sits at a narrows of the Mun (Thai: แม่น้ำมูล) river and was a convenient river crossing point. The river provided the means for distributing utilitarian pottery produced in Dan Kwian to a wide market. The village, located on the road connecting Nakhon Ratchasima and Chok Chai, is broken into two distinct parts. Dan Kwian Din Phao (ด่านเกวียนดินเผา), a congregation of larger factories and a roadside sales area for ceramics, both local and sourced from other centers in Thailand, is located about 2 kilometers north of the historic village Moo Baan Dan Kwian (หมู่บ้านด่านเกวียน). The Tambon covers a 10.17 km area. The people of Dan Kwian are mostly employed in handicrafts and farming.\n\nPottery production is said to have started around 1740, although this date has not been verified. The same account states that pottery production began with Mon (Thai: มอญ) refugees similar to the potters of Ko Kred (Kred Island). This claim, although popularly held, may not be accurate. \n\nPrior to approximately 1972 nearly all the products of Dan Kwian kilns were functional vessels. Common forms were water storage jars of around 50 liters capacity, lidded jars for preparing fermented fish, mortars, and basins. There is no evidence of tableware production at Dan Kwian. Most of the pottery is fired in above-ground anagama-style wood kilns, although at least one noborigama chamber kiln, many gas kilns, and at least one electric kiln have been used in recent years. Ceramic ware in Dan Kwian was traditionally fired in two distinct styles, Phao Dam (Thai:เผาดำ), or \"fired black,\" and Phao Deng (Thai:เผาแดง), \"fired red.\" Phao Dam ware was fired to temperatures between approximately and . The ware at this temperature became dark brown and vitreous. Phao Dam wares were prized for durability and lack of porosity. Most notable of these products are the once ubiquitous Dan Kwian water jars.\n\nStarting around 1972, decorative ware started to be made in Dan Kwian to serve a new market of urban consumers centered in Bangkok. University-based designers became involved with developing new products for hotels and other public spaces as well as private homes. At first this decorative ware consisted simply of water jars ornamented with carved decoration. Gradually the decorative ware expanded to include varied ornamental vessel forms, clay tile, carved ceramic murals, ceramic jewellery, and free-standing sculpture. Other media are also now produced in Dan Kwian, most notably cement-based carved sandstone replicas.\n"}

{"id": "123612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=123612", "title": "John Rawls", "text": "John Rawls\n\nJohn Bordley Rawls (; February 21, 1921 – November 24, 2002) was an American moral and political philosopher in the liberal tradition. He held the James Bryant Conant University Professorship at Harvard University and the Fulbright Fellowship at the University of Oxford. Rawls received both the Schock Prize for Logic and Philosophy and the National Humanities Medal in 1999, the latter presented by President Bill Clinton, in recognition of how Rawls's work \"helped a whole generation of learned Americans revive their faith in democracy itself.\"\n\nIn his 1990 introduction to the field, Will Kymlicka wrote that \"it is generally accepted that the recent rebirth of normative political philosophy began with the publication of John Rawls's \"A Theory of Justice\" in 1971.\" Rawls has often been described as the most important political philosopher of the 20th century. He has the unusual distinction among contemporary political philosophers of being frequently cited by the courts of law in the United States and Canada and referred to by practising politicians in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nRawls's theory of \"justice as fairness\" recommends equal basic rights, equality of opportunity, and promoting the interests of the least advantaged members of society. Rawls's argument for these principles of social justice uses a thought experiment called the \"original position\", in which people select what kind of society they would choose to live under if they did not know which social position they would personally occupy. In his later work \"Political Liberalism\" (1993), Rawls turned to the question of how political power could be made legitimate given reasonable disagreement about the nature of the good life.\n\nRawls was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the second of five sons of William Lee Rawls, \"one of the most prominent attorneys in Baltimore\", and Anna Abell Stump Rawls. Tragedy struck Rawls at a young age: \n\nTwo of his brothers died in childhood because they had contracted fatal illnesses from him. ... In 1928, the seven-year-old Rawls contracted diphtheria. His brother Bobby, younger by 20 months, visited him in his room and was fatally infected. The next winter, Rawls contracted pneumonia. Another younger brother, Tommy, caught the illness from him and died.\n\nRawls's biographer Thomas Pogge calls the loss of the brothers the \"most important events in John's childhood\".\n\nRawls attended the Calvert School in Baltimore for six years, before transferring to the Kent School, an Episcopalian preparatory school in Connecticut. Upon graduation in 1939, Rawls attended Princeton University where he graduated \"summa cum laude\" and was accepted into The Ivy Club and the American Whig-Cliosophic Society. During his last two years at Princeton, he \"became deeply concerned with theology and its doctrines.\" He considered attending a seminary to study for the Episcopal priesthood and wrote an \"intensely religious senior thesis (\"BI)\".\" At Princeton, Rawls was influenced by Norman Malcolm, Wittgenstein's student.\n\nHe completed his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1943, and enlisted in the Army in February of that year.\n\nDuring World War II, Rawls served as an infantryman in the Pacific, where he toured New Guinea and was awarded a Bronze Star; and the Philippines, where he endured intensive trench warfare and witnessed horrific scenes such as seeing a soldier remove his helmet and take a bullet to the head, rather than continue with the war. There, he lost his Christian faith.\n\nFollowing the surrender of Japan, Rawls became part of General MacArthur's occupying army and was promoted to sergeant. But he became disillusioned with the military when he saw the aftermath of the atomic blast in Hiroshima. Rawls then disobeyed an order to discipline a fellow soldier, believing no punishment was justified, and was demoted back to private. Disenchanted, he left the military in January 1946. After his military service, Rawls became an atheist.\n\nIn early 1946, Rawls returned to Princeton to pursue a doctorate in moral philosophy.\n\nHe married Margaret Warfield Fox, a Brown University graduate, in 1949. They had four children, Anne Warfield, Robert Lee, Alexander Emory, and Elizabeth Fox.\n\nAfter earning his PhD from Princeton in 1950, Rawls taught there until 1952 when he received a Fulbright Fellowship to Oxford University (Christ Church), where he was influenced by the liberal political theorist and historian Isaiah Berlin and the legal theorist H. L. A. Hart. After returning to the United States he served first as an assistant and then associate professor at Cornell University. In 1962 he became a full professor of philosophy at Cornell, and soon achieved a tenured position at MIT. That same year he moved to Harvard University, where he taught for almost forty years and where he trained some of the leading contemporary figures in moral and political philosophy, including Thomas Nagel, Allan Gibbard, Onora O'Neill, Adrian Piper, Elizabeth S. Anderson, Christine Korsgaard, Susan Neiman, Claudia Card, Thomas Pogge, T. M. Scanlon, Barbara Herman, Joshua Cohen, Thomas E. Hill Jr., Gurcharan Das, Andreas Teuber, Samuel Freeman and Paul Weithman.\n\nRawls seldom gave interviews and, having both a stutter (partially born out of the deaths of two of his brothers via infections contracted from himself) and a \"bat-like horror of the limelight\", did not become a public intellectual despite his fame. He instead remained committed mainly to his academic and family life.\n\nIn 1995 he suffered the first of several strokes, severely impeding his ability to continue to work. He was nevertheless able to complete a book titled \"The Law of Peoples\", the most complete statement of his views on international justice, and shortly before his death in November 2002 published \"Justice As Fairness: A Restatement\", a response to criticisms of \"A Theory of Justice\".\n\nRawls died on 24 November 2002 and is buried at the Mount Auburn Cemetery in Massachusetts. He was survived by his wife, their four children, and four grandchildren.\n\nRawls published three main books. The first, \"A Theory of Justice\", focused on distributive justice and attempted to reconcile the competing claims of the values of freedom and equality. The second, \"Political Liberalism\", addressed the question of how citizens divided by intractable religious and philosophical disagreements could come to endorse a constitutional democratic regime. The third, \"The Law of Peoples\", focused on the issue of global justice.\n\nRawls's \"magnum opus\" titled \"A Theory of Justice\", published in 1971, aimed to resolve the seemingly competing claims of freedom and equality. The shape Rawls's resolution took, however, was not that of a balancing act that compromised or weakened the moral claim of one value compared with the other. Rather, his intent was to show that notions of freedom and equality could be integrated into a seamless unity he called \"justice as fairness\". By attempting to enhance the perspective which his readers should take when thinking about justice, Rawls hoped to show the supposed conflict between freedom and equality to be illusory.\n\nRawls's \"A Theory of Justice\" (1971) includes a thought experiment he called the \"original position\". The intuition motivating its employment is this: the enterprise of political philosophy will be greatly benefited by a specification of the correct standpoint a person should take in his or her thinking about justice. When we think about what it would mean for a just state of affairs to obtain between persons, we eliminate certain features (such as hair or eye color, height, race, etc.) and fixate upon others. Rawls's original position is meant to encode all of our intuitions about which features are relevant, and which irrelevant, for the purposes of deliberating well about justice.\n\nThe original position is Rawls' hypothetical scenario in which a group of persons is set the task of reaching an agreement about the kind of political and economic structure they want for a society, which they will then occupy. Each individual, however, deliberates behind a \"veil of ignorance\": each lacks knowledge, for example, of his or her gender, race, age, intelligence, wealth, skills, education and religion. The only thing that a given member knows about themselves is that they are in possession of the basic capacities necessary to fully and willfully participate in an enduring system of mutual cooperation; each knows they can be a member of the society.\n\nRawls posits two basic capacities that the individuals would know themselves to possess. First, individuals know that they have the capacity to form, pursue, and revise a conception of the good, or life plan. Exactly what sort of conception of the good this is, however, the individual does not yet know. It may be, for example, religious or secular, but at the start, the individual in the original position does not know which. Second, each individual understands him or herself to have the capacity to develop a sense of justice and a generally effective desire to abide by it. Knowing only these two features of themselves, the group will deliberate in order to design a social structure, during which each person will seek his or her maximal advantage. The idea is that proposals that we would ordinarily think of as unjust – such as that blacks or women should not be allowed to hold public office – will not be proposed, in this, Rawls' original position, because it would be \"irrational\" to propose them. The reason is simple: one does not know whether he himself would be a woman or a black person. This position is expressed in the difference principle, according to which, in a system of ignorance about one's status, one would strive to improve the position of the worst off, because he might find himself in that position.\n\nRawls develops his original position by modeling it, in certain respects at least, after the \"initial situations\" of various social contract thinkers who came before him, including Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. (Each social contractarian constructs his/her initial situation somewhat differently, having in mind a unique political morality s/he intends the thought experiment to generate.) Iain King has suggested the original position draws on Rawls' experiences in post-war Japan, where the US Army was challenged with designing new social and political authorities for the country, while \"imagining away all that had gone before.\"\n\nIn social justice processes, each person early on makes decisions about which features of persons to consider and which to ignore. Rawls's aspiration is to have created a thought experiment whereby a version of that process is carried to its completion, illuminating the correct standpoint a person should take in his or her thinking about justice. If he has succeeded, then the original position thought experiment may function as a full specification of the moral standpoint we should attempt to achieve when deliberating about social justice.\n\nIn setting out his theory, Rawls described his method as one of \"reflective equilibrium\", a concept which has since been used in other areas of philosophy. Reflective equilibrium is achieved by mutually adjusting one's general principles and one's considered judgements on particular cases, to bring the two into line with one another.\n\nRawls derives two principles of justice from the original position. The first of these is the Liberty Principle, which establishes equal basic liberties for all citizens. 'Basic' liberty entails the (familiar in the liberal tradition) freedoms of conscience, association and expression as well as democratic rights; Rawls also includes a \"personal property\" right, but this is defended in terms of moral capacities and self-respect, rather than an appeal to a natural right of self-ownership (this distinguishes Rawls's account from the classical liberalism of John Locke and the libertarianism of Robert Nozick).\n\nRawls argues that a second principle of equality would be agreed upon to guarantee liberties that represent meaningful options for all in society and ensure distributive justice. For example, formal guarantees of political voice and freedom of assembly are of little real worth to the desperately poor and marginalized in society. Demanding that everyone have exactly the same effective opportunities in life would almost certainly offend the very liberties that are supposedly being equalized. Nonetheless, we would want to ensure at least the \"fair worth\" of our liberties: wherever one ends up in society, one wants life to be worth living, with enough effective freedom to pursue personal goals. Thus participants would be moved to affirm a two-part second principle comprising Fair Equality of Opportunity and the famous (and controversial) difference principle. This second principle ensures that those with comparable talents and motivation face roughly similar life chances and that inequalities in society work to the benefit of the least advantaged.\n\nRawls held that these principles of justice apply to the \"basic structure\" of fundamental social institutions (such as the judiciary, the economic structure and the political constitution), a qualification that has been the source of some controversy and constructive debate (see the work of Gerald Cohen).\n\nRawls further argued that these principles were to be 'lexically ordered' to award priority to basic liberties over the more equality-oriented demands of the second principle. This has also been a topic of much debate among moral and political philosophers.\n\nFinally, Rawls took his approach as applying in the first instance to what he called a \"well-ordered society ... designed to advance the good of its members and effectively regulated by a public conception of justice\". In this respect, he understood justice as fairness as a contribution to \"ideal theory\", the determination of \"principles that characterize a well-ordered society under favorable circumstances\". Much recent work in political philosophy has asked what justice as fairness might dictate (or indeed, whether it is very useful at all) for problems of \"partial compliance\" under \"nonideal theory\".\n\nIn \"Political Liberalism\" (1993), Rawls turned towards the question of political legitimacy in the context of intractable philosophical, religious, and moral disagreement amongst citizens regarding the human good. Such disagreement, he insisted, was reasonable – the result of the free exercise of human rationality under the conditions of open enquiry and free conscience that the liberal state is designed to safeguard. The question of legitimacy in the face of reasonable disagreement was urgent for Rawls because his own justification of Justice as Fairness relied upon a Kantian conception of the human good that can be reasonably rejected. If the political conception offered in \"A Theory of Justice\" can only be shown to be good by invoking a controversial conception of human flourishing, it is unclear how a liberal state ordered according to it could possibly be legitimate.\n\nThe intuition animating this seemingly new concern is actually no different from the guiding idea of \"A Theory of Justice\", namely that the fundamental charter of a society must rely only on principles, arguments and reasons that cannot be reasonably rejected by the citizens whose lives will be limited by its social, legal, and political circumscriptions. In other words, the legitimacy of a law is contingent upon its justification being impossible to reasonably reject. This old insight took on a new shape, however, when Rawls realized that its application must extend to the deep justification of Justice as Fairness itself, which he had presented in terms of a reasonably rejectable (Kantian) conception of human flourishing as the free development of autonomous moral agency.\n\nThe core of Political Liberalism, accordingly, is its insistence that, in order to retain its legitimacy, the liberal state must commit itself to the \"ideal of public reason\". This roughly means that citizens in their public capacity must engage one another only in terms of reasons whose status \"as\" reasons is shared between them. Political reasoning, then, is to proceed purely in terms of \"public reasons\". For example: a Supreme Court justice deliberating on whether or not the denial to homosexuals of the ability to marry constitutes a violation of the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause may not advert to his religious convictions on the matter, but he may take into account the argument that a same-sex household provides sub-optimal conditions for a child's development. This is because reasons based upon the interpretation of sacred text are non-public (their force as reasons relies upon faith commitments that can be reasonably rejected), whereas reasons that rely upon the value of providing children with environments in which they may develop optimally are public reasons – their status as reasons draws upon no deep, controversial conception of human flourishing.\n\nRawls held that the duty of civility – the duty of citizens to offer one another reasons that are mutually understood as reasons – applies within what he called the \"public political forum\". This forum extends from the upper reaches of government – for example the supreme legislative and judicial bodies of the society – all the way down to the deliberations of a citizen deciding for whom to vote in state legislatures or how to vote in public referenda. Campaigning politicians should also, he believed, refrain from pandering to the non-public religious or moral convictions of their constituencies.\n\nThe ideal of public reason secures the dominance of the public political values – freedom, equality, and fairness – that serve as the foundation of the liberal state. But what about the justification of these values? Since any such justification would necessarily draw upon deep (religious or moral) metaphysical commitments which would be reasonably rejectable, Rawls held that the public political values may only be justified privately by individual citizens. The public liberal political conception and its attendant values may and will be affirmed publicly (in judicial opinions and presidential addresses, for example) but its deep justifications will not. The task of justification falls to what Rawls called the \"reasonable comprehensive doctrines\" and the citizens who subscribe to them. A reasonable Catholic will justify the liberal values one way, a reasonable Muslim another, and a reasonable secular citizen yet another way. One may illustrate Rawls's idea using a Venn diagram: the public political values will be the shared space upon which overlap numerous reasonable comprehensive doctrines. Rawls's account of stability presented in \"A Theory of Justice\" is a detailed portrait of the compatibility of one – Kantian – comprehensive doctrine with justice as fairness. His hope is that similar accounts may be presented for many other comprehensive doctrines. This is Rawls's famous notion of an \"overlapping consensus\".\n\nSuch a consensus would necessarily exclude some doctrines, namely, those that are \"unreasonable\", and so one may wonder what Rawls has to say about such doctrines. An unreasonable comprehensive doctrine is unreasonable in the sense that it is incompatible with the duty of civility. This is simply another way of saying that an unreasonable doctrine is incompatible with the fundamental political values a liberal theory of justice is designed to safeguard – freedom, equality and fairness. So one answer to the question of what Rawls has to say about such doctrines is – nothing. For one thing, the liberal state cannot justify itself to individuals (such as religious fundamentalists) who hold to such doctrines, because any such justification would – as has been noted – proceed in terms of controversial moral or religious commitments that are excluded from the public political forum. But, more importantly, the goal of the Rawlsian project is primarily to determine whether or not the liberal conception of political legitimacy is internally coherent, and this project is carried out by the specification of what sorts of reasons persons committed to liberal values are permitted to use in their dialogue, deliberations and arguments with one another about political matters. The Rawlsian project has this goal to the exclusion of concern with justifying liberal values to those not already committed – or at least open – to them. Rawls's concern is with whether or not the idea of political legitimacy fleshed out in terms of the duty of civility and mutual justification can serve as a viable form of public discourse in the face of the religious and moral pluralism of modern democratic society, not with justifying this conception of political legitimacy in the first place.\n\nRawls also modified the principles of justice as follows (with the first principle having priority over the second, and the first half of the second having priority over the latter half):\n\n\nThese principles are subtly modified from the principles in \"Theory\". The first principle now reads \"equal claim\" instead of \"equal right\", and he also replaces the phrase \"system of basic liberties\" with \"a fully adequate scheme of equal basic rights and liberties\". The two parts of the second principle are also switched, so that the difference principle becomes the latter of the three.\n\nAlthough there were passing comments on international affairs in \"A Theory of Justice\", it wasn't until late in his career that Rawls formulated a comprehensive theory of international politics with the publication of \"The Law of Peoples\". He claimed there that \"well-ordered\" peoples could be either \"liberal\" or \"decent\". Rawls argued that the legitimacy of a liberal international order is contingent on tolerating \"decent peoples\", which differ from \"liberal peoples\", among other ways, in that they might have state religions and deny adherents of minority faiths the right to hold positions of power within the state, and might organize political participation via consultation hierarchies rather than elections. However, no well-ordered peoples may violate human rights or behave in an externally aggressive manner. Peoples that fail to meet the criteria of \"liberal\" or \"decent\" peoples are referred to as \"outlaw states\", \"societies burdened by unfavourable conditions\" or \"benevolent absolutisms\" depending on their particular failings. Such peoples do not have the right to mutual respect and toleration possessed by liberal and decent peoples.\n\nRawls's views on global distributive justice as they were expressed in this work surprised many of his fellow egalitarian liberals. For example, Charles Beitz had previously written a study that argued for the application of Rawls's Difference Principles globally. Rawls denied that his principles should be so applied, partly on the grounds that states, unlike citizens, were self-sufficient in the cooperative enterprises that constitute domestic societies. Although Rawls recognized that aid should be given to governments which are unable to protect human rights for economic reasons, he claimed that the purpose for this aid is not to achieve an eventual state of global equality, but rather only to ensure that these societies could maintain liberal or decent political institutions. He argued, among other things, that continuing to give aid indefinitely would see nations with industrious populations subsidize those with idle populations and would create a moral hazard problem where governments could spend irresponsibly in the knowledge that they will be bailed out by those nations who had spent responsibly.\n\nRawls's discussion of \"non-ideal\" theory, on the other hand, included a condemnation of bombing civilians and of the American bombing of German and Japanese cities in World War II, as well as discussions of immigration and nuclear proliferation. He also detailed here the ideal of the statesman, a political leader who looks to the next generation and promotes international harmony, even in the face of significant domestic pressure to act otherwise. Rawls also controversially claimed that violations of human rights can legitimize military intervention in the violating states, though he also expressed the hope that such societies could be induced to reform peacefully by the good example of liberal and decent peoples.\n\n\nJohn Rawls is the subject of \"\", an award-nominated musical billed as an \"all-singing, all-dancing romp through 2,500 years of political philosophy\". The musical premiered at Oxford in 2013 and was revived for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.\n\nThe ideas of John Rawls have had wide-ranging influence. In the field of religious and moral education, Rawls's concepts of overlapping consensus, reasonable pluralism and hypothetical contract have been applied to consider problems of fairness and representation in public education, yielding conclusions that differ substantially from his own position on these matters.\nSome differing conclusions are explored in Instrumental and value rationality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Shelley originally intended the poem to appear in \"The Examiner\", a Radical paper edited by Leigh Hunt, but then decided instead on anonymous publication by Charles Ollier. This plan fell through, and \"Julian and Maddalo\" first appeared after Shelley's death in a volume of his works called \"Posthumous Poems\" in 1824 (see 1824 in poetry), edited by his widow. It is inspired by conversations Shelley had with Byron in Venice in 1818, in which they explored their different outlooks on life. The bitter cynicism of Count Maddalo in the poem reflects closely Lord Byron's views, as Julian's atheism and faith in the potentialities of man does those of Shelley himself. It is written in a conversational, natural style, which had not until then been usual in Shelley's works, and which may have been partly suggested by Byron's poem \"Beppo\". \"Julian and Maddalo\" was in its turn a strong influence on the dramatic monologues of Robert Browning.\n\n\"Julian and Maddalo\" is prefaced by a prose description of the main characters. Maddalo is described as a rich Venetian nobleman whose \"passions and…powers are incomparably greater than those of other men; and, instead of the latter having been employed in curbing the former, they have mutually lent each other strength\"; while Julian is said to be\nan Englishman of good family, passionately attached to those philosophical notions which assert the power of man over his own mind, and the immense improvements of which, by the extinction of certain moral superstitions, human society may be yet susceptible…He is a complete infidel, and a scoffer at all things reputed holy.\nThe poem proper then begins with a depiction of the two title characters riding through a Venetian scene and discussing the subjects of religious faith, free will and progress. Julian\nThey then board the Count's gondola and pass a lunatic asylum, which provokes from Maddalo a comparison between the inmates' situation and the futility of all mortal life. The next day Julian visits Maddalo and meets his baby daughter (based on Byron's daughter Allegra), whose childish innocence inspires him to a statement of his own optimistic belief in the power of Good. Maddalo dismisses Julian's creed as Utopian, and compares him with a former friend who has since gone mad known as the Maniac. They again take the gondola to the madhouse to meet this man, the Maniac, who tells them a confused and disconnected account of an ill-fated romance and of his abandonment by his lover. (This character has been identified by scholars as a composite of Shelley himself and the poet Tasso; the lover perhaps as Mary Shelley, whose relationship with the poet had lately been under some strain.) Julian and Maddalo are downcast by the Maniac's story, Maddalo commenting that\nMost wretched menAre cradled into poetry by wrong,They learn in suffering what they teach in song.\nJulian leaves Venice but, returning many years later, asks Maddalo's daughter about the madman or the Maniac and is told that his lover had returned and again left him, and that both were now dead.\n\n"}

It is considered d'Aurevilly's masterpiece.\n\nD'Aurevilly, due to the boredom induced by bourgeois life in the Second French Republic, was a dandy. Similarly, the acts committed by the characters in these stories are induced not only by their extreme passion but also by their boredom. Some of the characters spend hours playing whist while others take delight in wearing fine clothes.

His memoirs have frequently been republished and his name is engraved on the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nHe studied painting in the studio of Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes, alongside Jean-Victor Bertin, but left the studio to volunteer in the Compagnie des arts de Paris in 1792. He received his baptism of fire in the battle of Valmy later that year. He became a sergeant in the 1st Arsenal battalion and in 1793 moved to the artillery at La Fère, assisting in the sieges of Landrecies, Le Quesnoy and Valenciennes. At Valenciennes he became aide-de-camp to general Jacob then, as a lieutenant on attachment to the engineers, took part in the 1794 Holland campaign and the 1795 campaign.\n\nCalled to the depot in 1798, he succeeded brilliantly in his exams and was made a captain on attachment to the engineers. He became aide-de-camp to Marshal Berthier in 1800, a post he retained until 1812 and in which he took an active part in practically all of the Napoleonic campaigns. He was wounded and captured in Spain. He was promoted to full captain after Marengo and chef de bataillon after Austerlitz, also becoming a knight of the Légion d'honneur and a colonel at the Siege of Saragossa.\n\nThe German campaign of 1806 brought him to Munich, where he visited the workshop of Alois Senefelder, the inventor of lithography. Lejeune was fascinated by the possibilities of the new method and whilst there he made the drawing on stone of his famous Cossack (printed by C. and ~f. Senefelder, 1806). Whilst he was taking his dinner, and with his horses harnessed and waiting to take him back to Paris, one hundred proofs were printed, one of which he subsequently submitted to Napoleon. The introduction of lithography into France was greatly due to the efforts of Lejeune.\n\nIn 1812, during the French invasion of Russia, he was made général de brigade and chief of staff to Davout. Frostbitten on the face, Lejeune left his post during the retreat from Russia and was arrested on the orders of Napoleon. Freed in March 1813, Lejeune was then sent to the Illyrian provinces, before rejoining the army under the orders of marshal Oudinot, becoming his chief of staff. During the Saxony campaign, Lejeune was present at the Battle of Lutzen (1813), the crossing of the River Spree and at Bautzen. He was made an officer of the Légion d'honneur and a commander of the Order of Maximilian of Bavaria. At the battle of Hoyersverda, when Bülow's corps wiped out the 12th corps formed up in square on the plain, Lejeune (at risk of being kidnapped) ventured into the enemy lines with one battalion, general Wolf's cavalry and six 12 pounder guns. He thus broke the whole of the Prussian artillery and saved marshal Oudinot and his army. Wounded several times and lastly at Hanau, he was authorised to leave the army in November 1813 after more than 20 years' service. After his departure from the army, he devoted himself to painting.\n\nAfter an initial grant in Hanover in 1808, and a second in Westphalia in 1810, he was made a baron d'Empire in 1810. Already a member of the cross of the Order of Leopold, Lejeune was made a knight of St Louis by Louis XVIII and in 1823 a commander of the Légion d'honneur. He returned to the army (now under the Bourbons) from 1818 to 1824, becoming commander of Haute-Garonne in 1831. On 2 September 1821 he married Louise Clary, sister of general Marius Clary and niece of Désirée Clary, queen of Sweden by her marriage with Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte. In 1824 the king of Sweden conferred on Lejeune the grand-cross of the Order of the Sword. In 1837 he became director of the École des beaux-arts et de l’industrie in Toulouse, a city of which he became mayor in 1841 and in which he died of a heart attack aged 73.\n\n\nLejeune's name has been inscribed on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris (19th column).\n\nHe produced an important series of battle-pictures based on his experiences. He had kept his paintbrushes with him on the battlefield and the popularity he enjoyed was due to the truth and vigour of his work, which was generally executed from sketches and studies made on the battlefield. His works are known for their lofty perspective' \"offering a panoramic view of the totality of the battle's events.\" When his battle-pictures were shown at the Egyptian Hall in London, a rail had to be put up to protect them from the eager crowds of sightseers. He is best known for his paintings of the battle of Guirando, which appeared in 1819 to enormous success, and of the battle of Borodino, his masterwork. Many of his battle-pictures were engraved by Jacques Joseph Coiny and Edme Bovinet. He also produced several studies of uniforms in the French Imperial Army, such as those of the lancers of Berg under Murat and of Berthier's aides-de-camp.\n\nAmong his chief works are \"The Entry of Charles X. into Paris, 6 June 1825\" at Versailles; \"Episode of the Prussian War, October 1807\" at Douai Museum; \"Marengo (1801)\"; \"Lodi, Thabor, Aboukir\" (1804); \"The Pyramids\" (1806); \"Passage of the Rhine in 1795\" (1824), and \"Moskawa\" (??).\n\nIn the historical novel \"The Battle\" Lejeune is a main character.\n\n"}

She has been part of the company Complot since 2007.\n\nIn her childhood, Percovich already liked the theater through the influence of her parents, who helped her to be a \"conscious spectator\", although she had decided not to be an actress. Before starting her theatrical career, she worked as a in different media, such as at the weekly magazine \"Búsqueda\", where she held the post of editor of the culture section, and also as a literature teacher at different theater schools.\n\nHer first contact with theater direction was due to the support of director Carlos Aguilera, who allowed her to be his assistant on all the rehearsals of his play \"Ya nadie recuerda a Frederick Chopin\" in 1982, when she was 19 years old.\n\nDue to the lack of training offers for theater directors, Percovich worked under the tutelage of Carlos Aguilera, as well as directors Héctor Manuel Vidal, Jorge Curi, and , and also her father, who \"made us look at architecture. From a very young age, he me to be very observant of my city.\"\n\nShe continued her training in Europe when she received a scholarship to the Royal Court Theatre in London, where she had as tutors Steven Berkoff and Stephen Daldry, among others. She was also at the in Paris, where she was a resident.\n\nIn 2004 she began her first term as director of the Municipal School of Dramatic Arts (EMAD), which lasted until 2007, when she resigned her position due to professional differences with teachers of the school.

Her intention since then has been the search for new languages generated by \"the aura and the symbols that emerge from those places\" to interact with their infrastructure and give them a new meaning that serves as a challenge for the viewer.\n\nIn 1990s, her style was influenced by a play by Antonio Araujo, who was followed by the public while he performed his work in the corridors and stairs of the abandoned hospital \"Umberto Primo\" in São Paulo, Brazil. This form of representation was subsequently used in her works \"Destino de dos cosas o de tres\", \"Juego de damas crueles\", \"El errante de Nod\", and \"Pentesilea\".\n\nPercovich was inspired by her colleague Roberto Bartís to define her way of seeing the acting work and thus transmit it to the actors who work with her:\n\n\n\"Juego de damas crueles\" has been Percovich's most awarded play. For it, she received the Florencio Award twice – one for best show and the other for best director.\n\nProyecto Feria was a street theatre project created by Percovich in response to an invitation from the Mercosur International Festival of Córdoba, Argentina, which was carried out at the different fairs of the city.

It made important contributions to fashion in the 1960s. It is particularly noted for its brightly colored printed fabrics and simple styles, used both in women's garments and in home furnishings.\n\nTwo designers in particular, Vuokko Nurmesniemi, with bold stripes, and Maija Isola, with large simple flowered prints such as the Unikko poppy, created hundreds of distinctive patterns and helped to make Marimekko a household name across the world.\n\nMarimekko was founded in 1951 by Viljo and Armi Ratia, after the Viljo's oil-cloth factory project failed and was converted to a garment plant. Armi asked some artist friends to apply their graphic designs to textiles. To show how the fabric could be used, the company then designed and sold a line of simple dresses using their fabric. When Finland's leading industrial designer Timo Sarpaneva invited the company to present a fashion show (albeit canceled at short notice) at the 1957 Triennale in Milan, this was an early recognition of fashion as an industrial art and of Marimekko's key role in the process. The garments were eventually showcased in the nearby Rinascente upscale department store by display manager Giorgio Armani.\n\nTwo pioneering designers set the tone for Marimekko: Vuokko Nurmesniemi in the 1950s and Maija Isola in the 1960s. Nurmesniemi designed the simply striped red and white \"Jokapoika\" shirt in 1956. Isola designed the iconic \"Unikko\" (poppy) print pattern in 1964. Marimekko's bold fabrics and bright, simple design strongly influenced late 20th-century taste. Many of the early Marimekko designs, including Isola's \"Unikko\", remain in production in the 2010s.\n\nMarimekko spread to America in the 1960s. It was introduced to the United States by the architect Benjamin C. Thompson, who featured them in his Design Research stores. They were made famous in the United States by Jacqueline Kennedy, who bought eight Marimekko dresses which she wore throughout the 1960 United States presidential campaign.\n\nBy 1965, the company employed over 400 staff, and the company was in every aspect of fine design, from fabrics to toys and dinnerware. The firm even completely equipped small houses with furnishings. In 1985, the company was sold to Amer-yhtymä. In the early 1990s, Marimekko was in a bad financial condition and close to bankruptcy. It was bought from Amer by Kirsti Paakkanen, who introduced new business methods in the company and helped to revive its popularity.\n\nLater in the 1990s Marimekko achieved publicity in the hit TV series \"Sex and the City\". The fictional main character of the series, sex-and-relationship columnist Carrie Bradshaw, wore a Marimekko bikini on season 2 and then a Marimekko dress. In season 5 the series introduced tablecloths with Marimekko prints.\n\nIn 2005, Marimekko's revenue had quadrupled since Paakkanen's purchase, and its net income had grown 200-fold. Paakkanen remained CEO of Marimekko and owned 20% of the company via her business Workidea. In 2007, Paakkanen announced she would gradually hand over her ownership to Mika Ihamuotila as CEO and biggest owner of the company. As of 2011, there are stores in New York City, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Oxford, Mississippi; Miami, Florida; and Vancouver, British Columbia. By September 2011 there were 84 stores across the world. Marikmekko products are (2017) made in China, India, Thailand and other countries. Fabrics are still printed in Marimekko's textile factory in Finland.\n\nThe logo of Marimekko has been in use since 1954. Armi Ratia wanted the logo to be simple and timeless. Graphic designer Helge Mether-Borgström used modified versions of classic Olivetti typewriter letters to create the logo.\n\nThe Marimekko name has been adopted within business and the management consultancy industry to refer to a specific type of bar chart known as a variable-width chart or Mosaic plot in which all the bars are of equal height, there are no spaces between the bars, and the bars are in turn each divided into segments of different width. The design of the mosaic plot resembles a Marimekko print. The chart's design encodes two variables (such as percentage of sales and market share), but it is criticised for making the data hard to perceive and to compare visually. The Marimekko has a sister chart called the Bar Mekko in which the bars are of variable height and width.\n\nCindy Babski wrote in the \"New York Times\" that \"There was never any doubt about what the inside label would say. The clothes and fabrics, with their striking design and splashes of bold color, were clearly Marimekko. But for people of a certain generation—those who came of age in the 1960's—they represented more than just a brand name: They conjured up an image and an era.\"\n\nIn 2007, Heidi Avellan wrote in the Swedish newspaper \"Sydsvenskan\" that Marimekko was no longer a \"statement, just as T-shirts with revolutionary Che Guevara or Palestinian scarves rarely express any political awareness. Marimekko is paper napkins and rubber boots\". She wrote that Marimekko \"began with the colourfully striped shirt, \"Jokapoika\" which Vuokko Nurmesniemi designed in 1956\", which became the symbol for new radicalism in academia.\n\n"}

The work was a best seller when it was first released, lasting for 72 weeks on \"The New York Times\" Bestsellers list.\n\nThe book is based on a number of court cases that Nizer argued in US courts. The original papers for many of these trials are held by the Columbia Law Library.\n\nAll six cases depicted within the book are civil cases, which is unusual for legal fiction and non-fiction because of the greater sensationality of criminal law cases. The book depicts the following cases: \n\nThe book was received favorably. \"Commentary\" magazine reviewer David T. Bazelon said he did not \"understand why it has become a bestseller\", but all in all \"Properly read, it is an occasion for some real understanding of the trial man. Haphazardly or naively read, it is interesting, instructive, and even exciting.\" Bazelon challenges praise by Max Lerner that the work is \"one of the great legal autobiographies of our time\". Kirkus reviews gave less praise, calling the book \"direct and orderly\" and enjoyable by \"Trial lawyers, law students, and the general public\".\n\nFor the most part, academic and legal reviewers of the autobiography were particularly harsh critics of the book. In \"The Modern Law Review,\" British reviewer C.P. Harvey commented \"I cannot help wondering what made Messrs. Heinmann think it would be good business to publish this book in [the United Kingdom].\" He writes \"I pronounce this book to be didactic, long-winded and pretentious\" and describes it as an example of \"the breadth of the ocean which lies between the English and American legal systems.\"\n\nIn the \"Osgoode Hall Law Journal\", reviewer R. N. Starr described the work as not exactly realistic, and taken to \"poetic license\". His review is rather skeptical and mixed; he writes: \"For my own part I would have preferred it, had Mr. Nizer put his wide experience to other purposes.\" In the \"Yale Law Review\" Joseph W. Bishop lambasts the piece as demonstrating the decline of legal practice, jury tried cases, and the flaws of the legal profession. Nonetheless, he describes the book as anything but \"dry and indigestable reading\" which is usually the case for accounts of legal cases.\n\nUnlike other academic reviewers, \"American Bar Association Journal\" reviewer Alfred Schweppe praised the book as a \"\"must\" for every lawyer searching for an answer to success in the courtroom\" and the describing the style as \"Moving with an easy finished prose\".\n\nThe book has inspired a number of people to become lawyers, including Laurie Levenson\nand Roy Black.\nNizer's subsequent book \"The Jury Returns\" follows much the same format and pattern as \"My Life in Court\", attempting to create a similar work and success.\n\nThe book was adapted into the 1963 Broadway play \"A Case of Libel\". The book was also adapted into a television film. Both depict the \"Reynolds v. Pegler\" case.\n"}

By 1912 the community had transformed into a true ”artists colony”, home to many notable artists of the time including Frederic Remington, AIta West Salisbury, Edward Kemble, Rufus Fairchild Zogbaurn, Orson Lowell, F. Wellingon Ruckstuhl, Ernest Albert, Homer Emons, Frederick Dana Marsh, Remington Schuyler, Lucius Wolcott Hitchcock, George T. Tobin, Leon Shafer, Charles Ayer, Herman Lambden and Armand Both.\n\nFor years there had been informal meetings in the studios of various artists, often with guests invited out from New York City. In 1912, however, Alta Salisbury West proposed that a more formal group be formed – the New Rochelle Art Association. The original group of artists included Charles F. Ayer, Frederick Dana Marsh, Remington Schuyler, Herman Lambden, George T. Tobin, Armand Booth, Leon Schafer, Lucius Hitchcock and Orson Lowell. Mrs. West became the first president. The Art Association produced its first public exhibition in 1914 as part of the celebrations surrounding the opening of the new Carnegie Public Library on Main Street which included both a large and small public exhibition room. This exhibition, organized under the auspices of the Art Section of the Woman's Club of New Rochelle, was the first exhibition of the New Rochelle Art Association. There were 140 juried entries of paintings and sculpture, including a painting by Frederic Remington and an outstanding bronze bust of Augustus Thomas by Robert Aitken.\n\nThe exhibiting artists included:\nThat exhibition was just the first of many at the library. The members of the Art Association continued to use the library to show their work. There were both group shows, generally featuring a particular media, and ones featuring various individual artists. Shows in the first few years included one devoted to the work of Frederick Dana Marsh and one to Milton Mayer, and a group show of the Association of Women Painters and Sculptors of New York City.\n\nOn January 4, 1920, a notice appeared on the bottom of New Rochelle's Evening Standard advertising the annual meeting of all members of the NRAA at the home of Orson Lowell. This was the meeting where the Art Association was formally organized and its aims set forth. Its stated plan was to cooperate with the Community Service which was promoting education, literacy and civic betterment programs in New Rochelle. By holding regular exhibitions of the highest quality, the Association planned to set an educational standard in the Fine Arts, and in other ways to promote public interest in art in the community. There were three classes of membership: active, associate, and patron. The Association was divided into four sections, each with a chairman and secretary, who had representation on the central board composed of the officers.\n\n\n\nThere were no known written by-laws of the Association until 1929, when, under the laws of the State of New York, the New Rochelle Art Association was required to develop its own constitution and by-laws for a membership corporation. In the early l930's the Constitution and By-Laws were updated to again meet State requirements, this time for a non-profit membership corporation.\n\nIn 1920, after the Association had been organized into its four main Sections, the 'Fine Arts Room' of the Library was acquired for the groups use. The first exhibition was put on by the 'Illustrators Section' and 57 paintings in every medium were displayed. The following year the exhibit included the Knickerbocker Press and The Little Print Press, both of New Rochelle, and showed the various processes used to make books. The 'Painters Section' soon followed with their own exhibit, followed by the 'Cartoonists'. Next there was the \"Little Picture Show\" and the \"Sketch Exhibit\" which both became annual events.\n\nFinally the 'Architects Section' mounted their exhibition. It wasn't until this show that brought together the work of a number of city architects that the community finally realized how many talented artists and masters of their profession actually resided in New Rochelle. Three medals were awarded at the exhibit including; Best Designed Residence - Phillip J. Rocker; Best Designed Commercial Building - Laurence M. Loeb; and the Best Rendering - George Licht.\n\nThe variety of shows was amazing. Kenneth Clark exhibited a number of his photographs and Henry Bultitude exhibited his miniature rooms creations. The graphic arts fueled continued interest, and drawings, illustrations, posters, wood and linoleum cuts, etchings, monotypes' and lithographic prints were shown.\n\nDuring the 1920s the New Rochelle Art Association continued to exhibit regularly. There were so many members that each show tended to be devoted to subsets of the membership. There were shows for illustrations, for painting and sculpture, for drawings and graphic arts, architecture and one devoted to arts and crafts. In between the group shows, smaller shows were held featuring a particular artist, or a particular medium. Many shows also featured a lecture related to the theme of the show. The organization often operated as a museum for the city. A show in November 1921, for example, featured paintings and sculptures loaned by local patrons. It was considered significant enough that \"The New York Times\" covered the show saying, “About $50,000 has emerged from the private collections of the locality”. The show included four examples of work by Winslow Homer.\nIn 1925 the Association organized a poster exhibition which included posters that had been part of a lawsuit in England. These were a series of posters featuring scenes from the British colonies done by Captain Spenser Pryse for the British Empire Exhibition, but had been rejected because some of the subjects were too scantily clad.\n\nIn 1925, the Association lost one of their notable illustrators - Edward Penfield. A Memorial Exhibition was held in his honor. He was considered the “originator of the poster in America” and for six years designed all the posters for \"Harper’s Magazine\". Many examples of his work were displayed.\n\nWhile, for the most part, the work that appeared in the shows seems to have been somewhat conservative in style, the members of the association were aware of current movements. They went out of their way to look for examples of work from overseas, and shows might include work by artists from London or Munich or Scandinavia. A 1926 show included work by Reginald Marsh. In 1927 they even hosted a show billed as a “Modern Show”. The following year they had a special section of the display area where they put “the more modern trend of paintings.” A 1928 show garnered a full page spread in the local paper with photos of many of the artists and their art. This show was also covered in \"The New York Times\" and was so popular that special trains ran out from New York City so that students could attend the show. Exhibitors included some of the stars of the illustration world including Ernest Watson, Federick R. Gruger, Franklin Booth and Percy Crosby, as well as Frederick Dana Marsh, Courtney Allen, George T. Tobin, Donald Teague, Leslie Zauner, J. C. Leyendecker, Dean Cornwall, Water B. Humphrey, Orson Lowell, Norman Rockwell, Revere Wistehuff, George Brehm, Charles Williams, Robert W. Stewart, C. J. Munro and Harold Anderson.\n\nIn the early 1950s, the First National Bank of New Rochelle opened its doors to the NRAA to exhibit paintings and sculpture. Fifteen years later the same bank, but under the name of the First Westchester National Bank, allowed the Association to use its facilities for a juried Sculpture and Ceramics Forms Exhibition. This type of show was the first of its kind.\nIn 1963, all the first-place winners from a year's worth of shows displayed their work together at the Ruth White gallery on 57th Street in New York City to generally favorable reviews.\n\nThe saddest exhibitions were the Memorial Tributes which were mounted shortly after a member's death. These were started in 1924 upon the passing of Frank X. Leyendecker. His Memorial exhibition drew large crowds from the fields of art, opera, publishing and stage. Six more memorials were held, from 1924 to 1934, for Clare Briggs, Edward Penfield, Coles Phillips, C.J. Munro, and Kenneth Clark.\n\nIn 1921, the New Rochelle Art Association conceived the idea of creating more interesting signs for the major approach roads to New Rochelle. In April of that year a model of one of the signs was displayed at the New Rochelle Trust company and in 1922 the City Council approved their construction. James Marsh, a member of the Art Association and a metal craftsman, wrought the signs by hand his studio from the designs and were given as a gift to the City from the NRAA. Ten of the twelve signs were completed in 1923 and were mounted on the cement stanchions at the main approach roads into the City. Each of the signs had a cutout design on the top and, hanging below on brackets, a separate sign made of iron that carried out the artist's motif with an inscription.\n\nThe signs include: \"Stage Coach Days\" - Edward Penfield; \"Landing of the Huguenots\" - George T. Tobin; \"When A Feller Needs A Friend\" - Clare Briggs; \"Indians Returning From The Deer Hunt\" - Remington Schuyler; \" of La Rochelle\" - James Marsh, son of Frederick Dana Marsh designed \"The Huguenot Ship\"; \"The City Of Homes\" - Ralph T. Robertson; \"Passing Of The British\" - by Coles Phillips; \"Rich In History\" - Norman Rockwell; and \"City Of Homes, Churches, and Schools\" - Laurence M. Loeb. The lettering on this last sign was changed later to read \"City Of Homes, Houses of Worship and Schools\". Walter Beach Humphrey and Lucius Hitchcock were other designers that contributed to this project. The signs caused a major sensation and were given national press coverage, and were copied in other communities across the country.\n\nAccording to Lucius Hitchcock, President of the NRAA in 1924, New Rochelle was not only the most affluent city in New York State, but had more artists per capita than almost any city in the U.S. To capitalize on both of these, the Art Association felt the time had come to sponsor an art school here, and would direct its policies and hire its teachers. At the beginning, the proposed New Rochelle Art School would afford opportunities for study to young men and women, although children and classes might also be established, including evening classes. The school was also give what would amount to collegiate work in architecture. The NRAA artists would receive no pay for their work and would do everything in connection with the school except assume financial responsibility. Their hope was to have the City fund this endeavor and they felt the best way to do this was through the Board of Education. According to a letter to the Board of Education, the plan was to charge tuition at New York Art School rates, of about $30 per week, to the students and, in return for the financial support given by the Board of Education, the school would offer free scholarships to public school pupils. The Association reserved the right to terminate the scholarship without recourse if the student failed in effort or disclosed what was judged to be a lack of appreciation of his opportunities. After much deliberation, the Board of Education turned them down. They reasoned that using taxpayer's money to maintain a school for the benefit of a few talented pupils was too narrow a focus.\n\nTwenty four years later a group of four NRAA artists established an art school. This time a private school named “The Huguenot School of Art” opened its doors at 352 North Avenue. It was an evening school so as to accommodate those individuals with a major interest in art who had to hold down full-time jobs. Its founders made up the faculty, with each having his area of expertise. The purpose of the school was to provide a carefully selected course of studies to develop sound training in drawing, painting, and creative composition as the foundation for an active career in the field of art. The curriculum consisted of basic, intermediate and advanced courses with Saturday classes for children. These were too progressively arranged so that the student would have the opportunity to explore the possibilities of many graphic media, and to present every constructive trend in the conservative and modern schools of art expression. For four years this school was an important element in the art world of the region.\n"}

In particular, videos showing the emotional reactions of people viewing television series episodes or film trailers are numerous and popular on video hosting services, particularly YouTube. The depicted persons may or may not be aware that they are being recorded. In some cases, the video being reacted is shown within the reaction video, allowing the reaction video's viewers to see what is being reacted to.\n\nOn television, reaction clips have for a long time been a feature of Japanese variety shows, showing celebrities and tarento reacting to video clips. An evolution of earlier 1970s Japanese TV quiz shows that featured audience participants responding to questions, Fuji Television's \"Naruhodo! The World\" in 1981 introduced a format where a panel of celebrities and comedians watched brief videos and answered questions on the video. This eventually evolved into the \"waipu\" format, where a \"waipu box\" superimposed on the corner of the screen shows a celebrity or tarento reacting to a video clip. This reaction format is still widely used in Japanese variety shows, where it is the equivalent of a laugh track on American television shows.\n\nOnline, one of the first viral reaction videos was that of a child reacting to the \"Scary Maze Game\" prank on YouTube in 2006. Beginning in 2007, reaction videos began to proliferate on the Internet. Among their first topics were reactions to the fetish pornography trailer \"2 Girls 1 Cup\". By 2011, videos of people recording themselves reacting to film trailers had become a staple of services such as YouTube. The numerous reaction videos for particularly popular or shocking television events, such as the 2013 \"Game of Thrones\" episode \"The Rains of Castamere\", have themselves become the subject of commentary.\n\nSam Anderson, commenting on the phenomenon for the \"New York Times Magazine\", described it as encapsulating the \"fundamental experience of the Internet\" in that it involved watching screens on which people watched screens, in a potentially infinite regression. The first reaction videos for the gross-out \"2 Girls 1 Cup\" allowed people, according to Anderson, to \"experience its dangerous thrill without having to encounter it directly—like Perseus looking at Medusa in the reflection of his shield\". But much like the later videos featuring reactions to items of popular culture, Anderson wrote, such videos provide the appeal of experiencing, \"at a time of increasing cultural difference, the comforting universality of human nature\" in showing people of all backgrounds reacting similarly to a shared cultural experience. In \"CraveOnline\", Witney Seibold derided reaction videos as \"graceless\" and \"narcissistic\", because they merely reflected immediate emotional reactions, and doubted that the reactions of a person aware of being filmed could in fact reflect the honest emotional response promised by the format.\n\n"}

Such creatures appear in mythologies from Europe, Japan, pre-Columbian Mexico, the United States, and Australia, and in numerous modern works.\n\nThe hoop snake, a creature of legend in the United States and Australia, is said to grasp its tail in its mouth and roll like a wheel towards its prey. Japanese culture includes a similar mythical creature, the \"Tsuchinoko\".\n\nBuer, a demon mentioned in the 16th-century grimoire \"Pseudomonarchia Daemonum\", was described in Collin de Plancy's 1825 edition of \"Dictionnaire Infernal\" as having \"the shape of a star or wheel\". The 1863 edition of this book featured an illustration by Louis Le Breton, depicting a creature with five legs radially arranged.\n\nNeil R. Jones' 1937 story \"On the Planet Fragment\" featured aliens dubbed the Disci, which were shaped like wheels with limbs around the circumference. One of their methods of locomotion was a \"rolling motion like that of a cartwheel.\"\n\nThe 1944 science fiction short story \"Arena\", by Fredric Brown, features a telepathic alien called an Outsider, which is roughly spherical and moves by rolling. The story was the basis for a 1967 \"\" episode of the same name, and possibly also a 1964 episode of \"The Outer Limits\" entitled \"Fun and Games\", though neither television treatment included a spherical creature.\n\nThe Dutch graphic artist M.

{"id": "37490861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37490861", "title": "Romanesque architecture in Spain", "text": "Romanesque architecture in Spain\n\nRomanesque architecture in Spain is the architectural style reflective of Romanesque architecture, with peculiar influences both from architectural styles outside the Iberian peninsula via Italy and France as well as traditional architectural patterns from within the peninsula. Romanesque architecture was developed in and propagated throughout Europe for more than two centuries, ranging approximately from the late tenth century until well into the thirteenth century.\n\nDuring the eighth century, though Carolingian Renaissance extended its influence to Christian Western Europe, Christian Spain remained attached to the traditional Hispano-Roman and Gothic culture, without being influenced by European cultural movements, until the arrival of the Romanesque.\n\nRomanesque architecture spread throughout the entire northern half of Spain, reaching as far as the Tagus river, at the height of the \"Reconquista\" and \"Repoblación\", movements which greatly favoured the Romanesque development. The First Romanesque style spread from Lombardy to the Catalan region via the \"Marca Hispánica\", where it was developed and from where it spread to the rest of the peninsula with the help of the Camino de Santiago and the Benedictine monasteries. Its mark was left especially on religious buildings (e.g. cathedrals, churches, monasteries, cloisters, chapels) which have survived into the twenty-first century, some better preserved than others. Civil monuments (bridges, palaces, castles, walls and towers) were also built in this style, although few have survived.\n\nThe Romanesque period corresponds to a time when Christianity was more secure and optimistic. Europe had seen, in the preceding centuries, the decline of the Carolingian splendour and had undergone Norman and Hungarian invasions (the Hungarians reached as far as Burgundy) that resulted in the destruction of many of the peninsula's monasteries. In Spain the Almanzor campaigns were disastrous, also razing and destroying many of the monasteries and small churches.\n\nTowards the end of the tenth century, a number of stabilizing events restored some balance and tranquillity in Europe, greatly easing the political situation and life in Christendom. The main forces that emerged were the Ottomans and the Holy Roman Empire, including the pope, whose power became universal and who had the power in Rome to crown emperors. In Spain the Christian kings were well underway with the \"Reconquista\", signing pacts and cohabitation charters with the Muslim kings. Within this context an organizational spirit emerged throughout Christendom with the monks from Cluny. Monasteries and churches were built during these years and architecture was geared towards more durable structures to withstand future attack as well as fire and natural disasters. The use of a vault instead of a wood covering spread throughout Europe.\n\nAdditionally communications were re-established and there was rapprochement between various European monarchs as well as restored relations with Byzantium. The Roman legacy of roads and highways allowed better communication between the numerous monasteries and facilitated pilgrimages to the holy places or small enclaves of popular devotion. As a result, commerce was increased and the movement of people disseminated new lifestyles, among which was the Romanesque style. Shrines, cathedrals, and others, were built in the Romanesque style over nearly two and a half centuries.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the concept of \"architect\" – as understood amongst the Romans – fell out of use, giving way to a social change. The duties of the former architect came to rest on the master builder. This was an artist who, in most cases, took part in the actual construction along with the team of workers which he had under his command. The master builder was the one who oversaw the edifice (as the ancient architect did), but at the same time could also be a craftsman, a sculptor, a carpenter or stonecutter. This person was usually educated in monasteries or groups of unionized masonic lodges. Many of these master builders were the designers of gorgeous portals or porticos, such as the one at the Santiago de Compostela Cathedral made by Master Mateo, the portico of the Nogal de las Huertas in Palencia, by Master Jimeno, or the north portal of the San Salvador de Ejea de los Caballeros Church (in Zaragoza province) by Master Agüero.\nAll Romanesque architectural work was made up of the director (master builder), a foreman in charge of a large group forming workshops of stonecutters, masons, sculptors, glassmakers, carpenters, painters and many other trades or specialties, who moved from one place to another. These crews formed workshops from which local masters often emerged, who were able to raise rural churches. In this set we must not forget the most important figure, the patron or developer, without whom the work would not be completed.\n\nFrom documents that have survived in Spain about works contracts, litigation and other issues, it is known that a house or living accommodation was allocated in the cathedrals for the master and his family. There are litigation documents that speak of the problems of the widow of a master, where she claimed for herself and her family a house for life. In some cases, this issue presented a real conflict as the subsequent master of the building would also need to occupy the house.\n\nThe master builders frequently had to commit themselves for a lifetime if the work were long-term, as was the case of Master Mateo with the construction of the Santiago de Compostela Cathedral or Master Ramon Llambard (or Raimundo Lambardo) with the Santa Maria de Urgel Cathedral. There was a provision in the contracts requiring that masters always provide: their daily presence on site and strict control of workers and of the progress of the building.\n\nA work house was also always built for the preparation of materials and carving of the stone. Many fourteenth-century documents speak of this house:\nLa obra de iglesia de Burgos que há unas casas cerca de la dicha iglesia en que tienen todas las cosas que son menester para la dicha obra; e los libros de las cuentas é todas las otras herramientas con que labran los maestros en la dicha obra. <br>(The construction of the Burgos church that has some houses near the said church in which they have all the things that are necessary for said work; and the books of the accounts and all other tools with which the masters labour in the said work.)\n\nStonemasons formed the bulk of workers in the erection of the building. The number of stonecutters could vary depending on the local economy. Some of these numbers are known, such as the Old Cathedral of Salamanca, which employed between 25 and 30. Aymeric Picaud in his Codex Calixtinus provides data that:\n\n[...] \"with about 50 other stonemasons who worked there regularly, under the caring direction of Don Wicarto\" (\"con aproximadamente otros 50 canteros que allí trabajaban asiduamente, bajo la solícita dirección de don Wicarto\")[...]\nThese masons and other workers were exempted from paying taxes. They were separated in two groups depending on their specialization. The first group those who were engaged in a special high-quality work (genuine sculpting artists) and who worked at their own pace, leaving their completed work at the site to be later placed on the building. The second group were permanent employees, who raised buildings stone upon stone and put in place those quality pieces or carved reliefs done by the first group at the right time. This way of working could lead to a time lag in the pieces being placed some time after being created, a lag in many cases which has become a big problem for historians in dating the building.\n\nThere was also a group of unskilled labourers who worked wherever there was a need. In many cases these people offered their work or skill as an act of mercy because as Christians they were willing to collaborate on a great work dedicated to their God. In any case they received a remuneration that was either by the day or per piece. In documents many names appear on lists of daily wages so this act was not arbitrary but rather well regulated.\n\nAmong the Cistercians they became known as \"cuadrillas de ponteadores\" (scoring crews), made up of laymen or monks who moved from one county to another, always under the direction of a professional monk, whose job it was to pave grounds, build roads, or build bridges.\n\nMost Romanesque works are anonymous in the sense of lacking a signature or proof of authorship. Even if the work is signed, specialists historians sometimes have difficulty distinguishing whether reference is made to the actual creator or the sponsor of the work. Sometimes however, the signature is followed or preceded by an explanation that clarifies whether it is one or the other person. Arnau Cadell made it clear on the Sant Cugat capital: \"This is the image of Arnau Cadell sculptor who built this cloister for posterity.\"\n\nhec est arnalli sculptoris forma catelli qui claustrum tale construxit perpetuale \n\nRodrigo Gustioz also wanted to be immortalized for his funding of an arch in the Santa Maria de Lebanza: Rodrigo Gustioz made this arc, a man from Valbuena, soldier, pray for him.\nisto arco fecitrodricus gustiut vir valdebonus militeorate pro illo \n\nThis notice by another sponsor appears on a capital:\n\"El prior Pedro Caro hizo esta iglesia, casa, claustro y todo lo que aquí está fundado en el año 1185.\" <br>Prior Pedro Caro made this church, house, cloister and everything here was founded in 1185.\n\nIn other cases it is the systematic study of the sculpture along with the architecture that has allowed historians to draw conclusions. Thus it is known that in the Lleida Cathedral, Pere de Coma served as master builder from 1190-1220, but during that period there were also several clearly differentiated sculpture workshops. The same study conducted in the Santiago de Compostela Cathedral suggests Master Mateo as the promoter and director of successive workshops which has aspects performed by different hands but under one coherent direction.\n\nThe fact that most Romanesque works have remained anonymous has developed the theory that the artist considered that he was not the right person to place his name on works dedicated to God. However, on one hand, the few civil works that remain are not signed either and on the other hand, such a view is countered by a long list that could be given of artists who sign their works themselves, among which are:\n\nThe list could be extended with many more names which appeared right on the stone itself by way of signature or on procurement documents, as proof that the intended construction was neither prohibited nor discouraged. What is difficult to distinguish in many cases is the trade of the person signing as they could either be architects, specialized stonemasons or sculptors of selected pieces. All of them were often called Master and all used his craft during the construction according to the wishes and the mandate of the promoters and patrons.\n\nIn the Romanesque world both the promoter of the works as well as the patron and financier were the true stars of the architectural work or the work of art to be created. They are in charge and determine how the work should be done, what should be the characters or the saints in sculpture and reliefs, the geometric dimensions (which then will be the responsibility of the true professional to carry them out with mathematical rigor) and they encourage and exalt the project. The promoters were in charge of hiring and also calling the best artists and architects who worked with their momentum and enthusiasm.\n\nEspecially in sculpture and painting, the artist was fully submitted to the will of the patrons and sponsors, without whose intervention the work would never be done. The Romanesque artist adapted to the will of these people giving the best work of his trade and complying with the satisfaction of a job well done without having any desire nor intending to acquire worldwide fame as he began to develop from the Renaissance. The pride of a job well done and the recognition of his peers and patron were the greatest of the awards and so sometimes this pride led them to put it very simply in one of his finished works.\n\nIn Spain, kings and a minority of the nobility introduced the new Romanesque trends early on (which carried with it a Benedictine renewal and acceptance of the Roman Liturgy), while another part of the nobility and most of the bishops and monks still clung to the old ways and the Hispanic liturgy. However the Romanesque fully triumphed and this was mainly due to the patrons and promoters who carried out great works from which the new style was developed throughout the northern half of the Iberian Peninsula.\nAbbot Oliba was a patron, sponsor and huge promoter of Romanesque art in Catalonia from an early date. In 1008 he was appointed abbot of the monasteries in Ripoll and Cuixá and ten years later he was appointed bishop of Vich. His travels to Rome (1011 and 1016) and his contact with Franco monasticism, accounted for his knowledge of the Roman liturgy and its introduction into the Catalan Church. The Benedictine reform in Cluny had a considerable impact on Cuixá with which Oliba maintained close relations. Oliba adopted Cluny's standards, both in architecture as well as customs and under his patronage and direction major reforms were carried out, new buildings or in other cases mere extensions to suit the needs of the times. During these initial years Abbot Oliba endeavored to be present at consecrations - meetings in which discussions regarding a particular construction, etc. were held. Oliba, during the period between 1030 and 1040 was the driving force behind important buildings such as:\n\n\nIn Spain geographical schools of architecture such as those in France, are not easily distinguished, because they are usually mixed with other architectural forms. However, there are a variety of buildings that can be clearly identified, if not entirely but to a large extent, as following the pattern of these French schools:\n\n\nEach kingdom, region or geographic region of the peninsula, and some human events (such as the Camino de Santiago), marked a distinctive style influenced by the geographical environment itself, by tradition, or simply by the gangs of hired masons and builders who moved from one place to another. As a result, in Romanesque architecture in Spain there are variations such as Catalan Romanesque, Aragonese Romanesque, Palencia Romanesque, Castilian and Leónese Romanesque, among others.\n\nAnother fact to consider is the survival of the Moorish populations, who formed gangs of workers and artists who gave a special stamp to buildings. These are what is known as brick Romanesque or Moorish Romanesque.\n\nIn Spain, as in the rest of the Western Christian world, Romanesque art developed over three stages with their own characteristics. Historiography has defined these stages as early Romanesque, full Romanesque and late Romanesque.\n\n\nRomanesque religious buildings were never as monumental as the French constructions, or the constructions that later gave rise to Gothic art. The first buildings designs had thick walls and small openings through which a dim light could enter from outside. Later there was an evolution in the construction of the walls allowing the buildings to be better lightened and for opening bigger windows.\n\nThe monastic buildings were the most numerous sharing importance with the cathedrals. Churches and parishes were constructed in cities while in small towns countless small churches, known as rural Romanesque, were built.\n\nThe most precious but also the most expensive material was the stone. The stonemasons busied themselves carving it with a chisel, always selecting the good face of the block. These were made into ashlars, which were generally available in horizontal rows and sometimes used along the edges. Hard rocks were almost always used. Masonry was also used, with hewn stone in the corners, windows and doors. If the stone was hard to get, because the corresponding geographic location had no quarries, or because it was too expensive at certain times, they used baked brick, slate or any ashlars stone. Paint and plaster were used as finish, both for the stone as well as for the masonry and the other materials, so that, once the walls were painted, it was difficult to distinguish whether it had one or the other underneath. Colourful Romanesque architecture was as widespread as it had been in Roman buildings.\n\nMedieval builders did extensive study for the foundation, taking into account the type of building that was to be built, the materials that were to be used and the ground upon which the building would be laid. First deep ditches were dug and were filled with stones and rubble. Trenches were distributed under the walls that would go over them and others were made crosswise in order to join the passageways together and strengthen the pillars of the transverse arches. The foundation formed a network that practically sketched the plan of the temple, thus differing from the isolated foundation for the support of the pillars used in the Gothic style. In some ruined churches all that remains is this foundation, giving archaeologists good study material. Archaeologists are able to determine the thickness of the walls from these revealed remains of the foundations, although it is known that in this respect the builders rather exaggerated and made excessively deep trenches and overly thick foundation for fear of landslides.\n\nDuring the First Romanesque period, many rural churches were still being covered with a wooden roof, more so in Catalonia and especially in the Boi Valley where the Romanesque renewal of old churches was done by Lombard builders who covered the gabled naves with a wooden structure, respecting the old traditions of the region. However, the apse in these churches was always topped with an oven vault.\n\nThroughout the eleventh century, naves were covered with barrel vaults, either a half barrel or a quarter barrel, a device used in Romanesque architecture throughout Europe. Later the groin vault was used. In Catalonia, these barrel vaults were used without reinforcements, while in Castile and León arches were used as support. The use of the groin vault (arising from the crossing of two perpendicular barrel vaults) had been lost and was later taken up by great master builders. The groin vault in turn gave way to the ribbed vault, which later became very common in Gothic architecture.\n\nThe type of vaults used exclusively on the stairs of the towers were also called helical vaults. Examples of their use are at San Martín de Fromista, Sant Pere de Galligants and San Salvador de Leyre, among others.\n\nCorner vaults were built in the cloisters of monasteries and cathedrals. These result from the meeting of two groups in a cloister. The finishing of these vaults was not very easy, so builders had to use various tricks that ensured that flaws were not easily visible to the naked eye.\n\nIn Spain the most used arch was the semicircular although the horseshoe arch and the pointed arch were also used. The arch was used exclusively throughout the eleventh century and first half of the twelfth century. In order to achieve certain heights, the vaults were made quite stilted, as in Sant Joan de les Abadesses. Many arcs were built doubled with the intention that they would be stronger. Later, in the portals, arches were formed with archivolts, i.e. a sequence of concentric arches decorated with simple or decorative plants or geometric mouldings.\n\nPointed arches came from the Orient. It is unknown the exact date of their use in Romanesque architecture in Spain, although historians proposed some dates based on buildings containing one or more pointed arches that sometimes spawn an entire vault in some of its parts. There are buildings that correspond to the first quarter of the twelfth century, such as the Lugo and Santa Maria de Terrassa cathedrals. The early use of these arcs became a construction element which provided many advantages. It was an architectural breakthrough that the Cistercian monks were able to see from the beginning.\n\nButtresses are continuous thick vertical walls that are placed at the sides of an arch or vault to counteract attacks. They were also placed on the outer walls of the naves of churches or cloisters. In Romanesque architecture are always visible is one of the elements that characterize it, especially in Spanish architecture, except in the Catalonia area where construction was done adopting a greater thickness of the walls.\n\nThe buildings were covered with a roof that could be made of different materials:\n\n\nIn Spanish buildings towers are located in different parts of the church - on the sides, over the transept and, in very special cases, over the straight section of the apse, as in the churches of the city of Sahagún in León. This placement was because, being built of brick (a material less consistent than stone), the builders had to locate the towers in the strongest, more resistant section (usually at the apses). A façade made up of two towers was not very common and usually seen only in temples of great importance.\n\nTowers served as steeples, especially in the Romanesque styles in Castile and León, they are what are called \"Turres signorum\". In many cases they were built as defence towers, especially in border territories experiencing military conflict, and the location of the tower depended on what was being defended. Thus the tower of the church of the Silos monastery was located to defend the monastery, the tower of the San Pedro de Arlanza monastery was a very important defence for the entire area. The military aspect of these Romanesque towers evolved and changed over time so that at present it is difficult to guess at their original purpose or purpose for which they were used in other eras. In many cases these towers were attached to the sides of the church, and some even completely independent of the churches.\n\nA gable is an architectural element that is usually built on the façade and used, instead of a tower, to house the bells. The bell-gable (referred to as \"espadaña\" in the Iberian peninsula) was built as a vertical continuation of the wall and the spans were opened to receive the bells. The gable was easier and cheaper to build. In Spanish Romanesque they were very numerous especially in smaller rural Romanesque churches. They were made of a single span or several terraced storeys. They usually had pointed or pinion tops.\n\nThere are all kinds of gables in the Romanesque style of Campoo and Valderredible. There are some spectacular ones in other locations such as the one at Agullana in the Alto Ampurdán or the Astudillo, with five openings. There are more modest ones such as at the Santa Maria de Valbuena Monastery where its veins also have a unique placement.\n\nDuring the Romanesque era, a building was not considered finished until its walls had appropriate paintings. The walls of the most important and significant parts (especially the apses) were lined inside with iconographic paintings, many of which have come down to the twenty-first century, such as those belonging to churches in the Tahull Valley. The walls, both inside and out, were covered with a layer of paint in one color and the imposts, vains and columns were highlighted in the original material, but sometimes they were also painted in bright colors: green, yellow, ocher, red and blue. This custom of painting or revoking the buildings was not new or unique to the Romanesque of the Middle Ages but represented an inheritance or continuity of the construction method from olden times.\n\nWhether the material used was stone, ashlar or if the masonry was in bricks, the finish was a painted surface. Thus, in many cases it could not be determined if the exterior was made of stone or brick, which could only be determined from plaster scrapings. The paint finish gave the buildings protection against environmental assaults but these were removed in the nineteenth-century when theories were applied to expose the original building materials.\n\nSome of these paintings have remained in certain buildings, as a testimony of the past, on walls, sculptures and capitals. On the façade of the , traces of paint were still visible into the twentieth century, as witnessed and described by the Spanish historian Marqués de Lozoya. Sometimes carving the baskets of the capitals was too expensive and they were left completely smooth so that the painter could finish them with floral or historical motifs. In the San Paio de Abeleda church in Ourense, there are vestiges of paintings on some capitals, which have even been repainted throughout its history. Fragments of capitals with their original painting have been found among the ruins of the San Pedro de Arlanza monastery and they give an indication of how the rest was decorated.\n\nCistercian and Premonstratensians monks also painted the walls of their churches, in white or a light earthy color, and they sometimes outlined the joints of the blocks.\n\nThe use of sculptures as decoration for buildings during the full Romanesque period was something so commonplace that it was considered a necessity. Architecture and sculpting represented an inseparable iconographical program. The idea of the Church (an idea developed and disseminated by the Benedictines of Cluny), was to teach Christian doctrine through the sculptures and paintings of the apses and interior walls. The capitals of the columns, the spandrels, the friezes, the cantilevers and the archivolts of the portals were intricately decorated with stories from the Old and New Testaments. These sculptures were not limited to religious depictions but also covered a number of profane but equally important issues to the eleventh- and twelfth-century population, such as field work, the calendar (as in the case of the capitals of the Santa María la Real de Nieva cloister, from late Romanesque), war, customs, among others. In other buildings real, mythological and symbolic animals were sculpted, plus allegories of vices and virtues (the best example can be given in the erotic corbels of the San Pedro de Cervatos Collegiate in southern Cantabria). These decorations were not always of a historical or animals type; geometric decoration was very important at the beginning of the Romanesque thus floral and plant decoration were also used. Often the carved tympanum or the frieze depicted a series of images along the capitals of the columns of the archivolts.\n\nThe temples of the First Romanesque are simple, with a single nave topped by a semicircular apse (without a transept). The prototype of the Romanesque church was non-rural, medium-sized and with the floor plan of a basilica with three naves containing three semicircular apses and a transept. Throughout the twelfth century the traditional Hispanic type temples with three straight and terraced apses were still being built in some areas (such as in the city of Zamora). Church plans were adapted to the liturgical needs, as the number of canons or friars who required more altars for their religious functions was increasing. Temples were built with Benedictine Cluny-style apses added. A long transept that could accommodate more apses was adopted in Cistercian architecture, and there are more examples of this type of construction. This feature was also adopted by the cathedrals (Tarragona, Lleida, Ourense and Sigüenza). There are also examples of cruciform structures that precisely depict a Latin cross, such as the eleventh-century Santa Marta de Tera church in Zamora, or the San Lorenzo de Zorita del Páramo church in Palencia, whose header is not square but semicircular. There are also circular plans, with a single nave such as the San Marcos church in Salamanca, or the Vera Cruz church in Segovia.\n\nIn the Romanesque era small churches or parish churches did not have vestries. Vestries were only added to these churches beginning in the sixteenth century. However, in the grand monasteries or cathedrals there was a space adapted in the cloister for this purpose.\n\nCrypts are one of the characteristic features of Romanesque architecture. In the First Romanesque, its use spread due to the influence of the Franks. Spaces were built just below the top of the church and were intended for keeping the relics of martyrs, the worship of whom came about from Carolingian influence. They usually had three naves with a groin vault cover, although there are variations, such as the circular crypt with a pillar in the center (Cuixá and Sant Pere de Rodes). Throughout the eleventh century, they began to lose importance as recipients of relics and were instead built for practical and necessary architectural purposes, adapting to the terrain on which the church was built (this is the function of the Monastery of Leyre crypt). Throughout the twelfth century, few crypts were built and those that were built were due to the uneven ground. Later the crypts were converted to funerary purposes.\n\nThe tribunes were galleries over the aisles that were used by important people to monitor the liturgy. They had little importance in Romanesque Spain, with their construction being very scarce. Two examples are known: the San Vicente de Avila and the Basilica of San Isidoro. Traditional historiography suggests that, in the latter church, the tribune was a special place for Queen Sancha, wife of Ferdinand I, but more recent studies show that the dates do not match. There is little information on this architecture.\n\nA triforium is a gallery with arches running along the top of the lower naves of a church, below the large windows of the main nave. It sometimes surrounds the apse at the same height. Its origin was purely cosmetic, since if the nave was too high there was a heavy space between the ceiling windows and the supporting arches of the lower lateral naves.\n\nAt first the arch of the triforium was not set, but it was then thought that it could be used to provide light and ventilation, while leaving a passage for building services and surveillance. This construction could be done because the aisles are always pushed into the central nave, thus leaving a usable hole of the same depth as the width of the aisle. This element had its true development in the Gothic era. In Spanish Romanesque architecture triforia are scarce because the bare wall was usually left in their place or a blind arcade was built.\n\nA good example of a triforium is the Santiago de Compostela cathedral. The aisles of this temple has two floors and the triforium occupies the entire second, covering the entire building and lining the outside by a series of windows that provide light and interior arches. Another example is in the Lugo Cathedral, although in this case it runs along all the walls. In San Vicente de Ávila the triforium is a dark gallery that does not provide light from outside.\n\nIn some pilgrimage churches the triforium was at times used as an area for overnight accommodation for pilgrims.\n\nThe portico is a space originally designed for preventing inclement weather. It was constructed in both rural and city churches, in front of the main door to protect it. In most cases they were made with a wooden structure that stood the test of time, but in many cases the construction was in stone resulting in galleries of great development, which in some cases were true works of art.\n\nThe porticos were reminiscent of the narthex of the Latin basilicas. It formed an advanced body over the central part of the main façade and if this façade had towers then it occupied the space between them, as in the Portico of Glory in Santiago de Compostela cathedral. At other times it occupied the entire front, forming a covered space that was called a \"Galilee\".\n\nRose windows are circular windows made of stone, whose origin is in the Roman oculus of the basilicas. In Spain these rose windows were employed from the eleventh century. Throughout the Romanesque, rose windows became important and increased in size, culminating in the Gothic era, which produced some of the most beautiful and spectacular specimens.\n\nThe cloister is an architectural unit usually built next to cathedrals and monastic churches, attached to the north or south. The cloister par excellence is the one promulgated by the Benedictine monks. The different units of the cloister, hinged on all four sides of a square courtyard, were dedicated to the service of the life of the community. In Spanish Romanesque many cloisters have been preserved, especially in the Catalan region.\n\nThe Romanesque civil architecture is almost unheard of and most of the buildings that are considered to be from this period, are not, although some retain parts of the foundation or a door or semicircular window from the Romanesque era, their development and architectural design belong to more modern times.\n\nDomestic buildings, including palaces, had no great pretensions. Houses were built of flimsy material (as opposed to the grandeur of the churches) and were unable to stand the test of time. When they wished to give importance to the civil architecture, the little that there was transformed and the new one was built with Gothic tendencies. So it was with the so-called Romanesque palace of Diego Gelmírez in Santiago de Compostela, which is actually a totally Gothic factory, or buildings of Segovia sinecures from the Middle Ages.\n\nThere is the famous palace of Dona Berenguela in the city of Leon, called a Romanesque palace, but its structure and planning actually correspond to the last years of the late Middle Ages, far from Romanesque, though it retains (perhaps from outside the original location) some Romanesque windows. There is also, in Cuéllar, the , the origin of which is supposed to date from the time of the \"Repoblación\". Maybe part of its foundations are Romanesque, but the current building is from the early fourteenth century, even though it has a Romanesque portal that was perhaps inherited from the previous building or reused from another. This palace is however considered as one of the few examples of civil Romanesque. Traditionally, buildings that have a good portal with a semicircular arch and large segments have been called \"Romanesque\" houses or palaces, but they are actually structures from the Gothic era.\n\nAn example of what could be a Romanesque palace built in stone is seen in the façade of the Palace of the Kings of Navarre in Estella, Navarre.\n\n\n"}

One of his main works, it is a monumental study and a classic in its field, though now antiquated.\n\nWestermarck, in the preface to \"The Origin and Development of the Moral Ideas\", describes the background to his work. Having concluded that there is a close connection between moral opinions and religious beliefs, he decided to acquire first-hand knowledge of the folklore of a non-European people, and to that end spent four years in Morocco collecting anthropological data, familiarizing himself with the native way of thinking, and gaining an understanding of local customs. He was also indebted to British science and thought.\n\nIn his introduction, Westermarck asks why different cultures have different moral views. Throughout the book, he attacks the idea that moral principles express objective value.\n\nWainwright Churchill criticizes Westermarck's claim that the Greeks of the Homeric era were unaware of or repudiated pederasty, citing the contrary view of classical scholar Hans Licht. Westermarck's use of the expression \"homosexual love\" has been given as an early example of the use of the word \"homosexual\" in English. The classicist David M. Halperin writes in \"One Hundred Years of Homosexuality\" (1990) that Westermarck's book formed part of a trend to interpret Greek sexual conventions in an anthropological and ethological context, an approach that contrasts with earlier scholarly studies that proceeded from the assumption that classical Greek society was virtually unique in its acceptance of pederasty.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "54016907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54016907", "title": "Time translation symmetry", "text": "Time translation symmetry\n\nTime translation symmetry or temporal translation symmetry (TTS) is a mathematical transformation in physics that moves the times of events through a common interval. Time translation symmetry is the hypothesis that the laws of physics are unchanged, (i.e. invariant) under such a transformation. Time translation symmetry is a rigorous way to formulate the idea that the laws of physics are the same throughout history. Time translation symmetry is closely connected via the Noether theorem, to conservation of energy. In mathematics, the set of all time translations on a given system form a Lie group.\n\nThere are many symmetries in nature besides time translation, such as spatial translation or rotational symmetries. These symmetries can be broken and explain diverse phenomena such as crystals, superconductivity, and the Higgs mechanism. However, it was thought until very recently that time translation symmetry could not be broken. Time crystals, a state of matter first observed in 2017, break time translation symmetry.\n\nSymmetries are of prime importance in physics and are closely related to the hypothesis that certain physical quantities are only relative and unobservable. Symmetries apply to the equations that govern the physical laws (e.g. to a Hamiltonian or Lagrangian) rather than the initial conditions, values or magnitudes of the equations themselves and state that the laws remain unchanged under a transformation. If a symmetry is preserved under a transformation it is said to be \"invariant\". Symmetries in nature lead directly to conservation laws, something which is precisely formulated by the Noether theorem.\n\nTo formally describe time translation symmetry we say the equations, or laws, that describe a system at times formula_1 and formula_2 are the same for any value of formula_1 and formula_4.\n\nFor example, considering Newton's equation:\n\nOne finds for its solutions formula_6 the combination:\n\ndoes not depend on the variable formula_1. Of course, this quantity describes the total energy whose conservation is due to the time translation invariance of the equation of motion. By studying the composition of symmetry transformations, e.g. of geometric objects, one reaches the conclusion that they form a group and, more specifically, a Lie transformation group if one considers continuous, finite symmetry transformations. Different symmetries form different groups with different geometries. Time independent Hamiltonian systems form a group of time translations that is described by the non-compact, abelian, Lie group formula_9. TTS is therefore a dynamical or Hamiltonian dependent symmetry rather than a kinematical symmetry which would be the same for the entire set of Hamiltonians at issue. Other examples can be seen in the study of time evolution equations of classical and quantum physics.\n\nMany differential equations describing time evolution equations are expressions of invariants associated to some Lie group and the theory of these groups provides a unifying viewpoint for the study of all special functions and all their properties. In fact, Sophus Lie invented the theory of Lie groups when studying the symmetries of differential equations. The integration of a (partial) differential equation by the method of separation of variables or by Lie algebraic methods is intimately connected with the existence of symmetries. For example, the exact solubility of the Schrodinger equation in quantum mechanics can be traced back to the underlying invariances. In the latter case, the investigation of symmetries allows for an interpretation of the degeneracies, where different configurations to have the same energy, which generally occur in the energy spectrum of quantum systems. Continuous symmetries in physics are often formulated in terms of infinitesimal rather than finite transformations, i.e. one considers the Lie algebra rather than the Lie group of transformations\n\nThe invariance of a Hamiltonian formula_10 of an isolated system under time translation implies its energy does not change with the passage of time. Conservation of energy implies, according to the Heisenberg equations of motion, that formula_11.\n\nor:\n\nWhere formula_14 is the time translation operator which implies invariance of the Hamiltonian under the time translation operation and leads to the conservation of energy.\n\nIn many nonlinear field theories like general relativity or Yang-Mills theories, the basic field equations are highly nonlinear and exact solutions are only known for ‘sufficiently symmetric’ distributions of matter (e.g. rotationally or axially symmetric configurations). Time translation symmetry is guaranteed only in spacetimes where the metric is static: that is, where there is a coordinate system in which the metric coefficients contain no time variable. Many general relativity systems are not static in any frame of reference so no conserved energy can be defined.\n\nTime crystals, a state of matter first observed in 2017, break time translation symmetry.\n\n\n"}

It was a production of the Hallstatt culture, probably dating to the 6th century BC. It is now in the Württembergisches Landesmuseum in Stuttgart, with a copy at the Hirschlanden site (now Ditzingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany), where it was found. The preserved height is 1.50 m, but the feet have been broken off.\n\nThe warrior wears a torc (neck-ring), a belt with a typical late Hallstatt dagger, and a pointed hat, possibly made (as with the real hat in the princely grave of Hochdorf) of birchbark.\n\nWhile the legs are modelled with some realism, the upper body is rather schematic and the face is extremely sketchy, leading to speculation that the man might be intended to be seen as wearing a mask, as is known from burials in Klein-Klein, Styria, Austria, Trebeništa (Macedonia) and the much earlier shaft-graves of Mycenae, ca. 1500 BC.\n\nThe statue shows significant weathering, suggesting that it stood exposed to the elements for a long time before being buried. Other anthropomorphic statues of the early Iron Age have been found in Rottenburg, Tübingen, Stammheim and Stockach (all Baden-Württemberg, Germany), but they are far more stylised, more carving than statue. In the following La Tène period, anthropomorphic statues are still very rare, but examples include the finds from Glauberg (Hessen, Germany), Holzgerlingen (Baden-Württemberg, Germany), the Mšecké Žehrovice Head (Bohemia), and the sculptures at Roquepertuse.\n\nGreek influence (\"kouroi\") has been discussed. Numerous black figure vessels from fortified settlements of the period attest trading contacts with the Mediterranean, probably via the Rhône River and the Greek colony of Massilia (Marseille). Much closer stylistic connections exist with the far more elaborate statues from Capestrano, Picenium, Italy (650-550 BC) and Casale Marittimo (middle of the 7th century).\n\nThe statue was found in Hirschlanden (now Ditzingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany) in 1963 when a low barrow was excavated. The barrow was surrounded by a stone circle and a dry stone wall. It contained 16 burials, ranging from the very beginning of the Iron Age (Hallstatt D1, ca. 600 BC) to the beginning of the Late Iron Age (La Tène period, ca. 450 BC). The statue was found north of the barrow, but is supposed to have been originally placed on the top.\n\n\n"}
