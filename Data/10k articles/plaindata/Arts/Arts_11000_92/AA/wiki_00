The film features Vikram And Soundarya Are in the lead roles. The film opened in 2001 to positive reviews from critics. The film was later re-shot and released in Tamil as \"Kanden Seethaiyai\". The film was premiered retrospective at the Toronto International Film Festival. The director shot the film in 15 days.\n\nThe film revolves around Savitri (Soundarya), an innocent simple and loving orphan, and Surendra (Vikram), an intelligent computer programmer. When Savitri has a marriage arranged with a drunkard, Surendra stops this alliance and graciously agreed to marry her.\n\nHowever, trouble starts when Surendra's brainchild, a virtual reality program on temples of South India is sabotaged, and he is accused of selling out to a rival company. Disillusioned by the sudden turn of events, he crashes into a truck and sustains a serious head injury that requires a major operation.\n\nSavitri finds herself deserted by all her well-wishers when it comes to financial help, and her husband's life hangs in the balance. A lady doctor suggests that she become pregnant through artificial insemination for a rich man, whose wife is impotent, in exchange for monetary remuneration. Savitri agrees and the rest of the film is based on the social stigma attached to artificial insemination and surrogate motherhood.\n\n\nA. R. Rahman was initially signed on to score the film's music, but he later opted out owing to the film's small budget. The film was premiered retrospective at the Toronto Film Festival in Canada. The director shot the film in just 15 days.\n\nThe film opened to very positive reviews with a critic noting that \"in short, this is cinema at its best\" and that \"the script is smooth flowing and engrossing\" and that \"it leaves you with a thought and a sense of pride in Indian cinema. Whether it will go down well with the masses is doubtful as there are no songs, action or cheap comedy, which might be a bitter pill to swallow for most\". In regard to performances, the critic notes that Soundarya \"excels in her role and that her expressions, body language and dialogue delivery fit her role like a glove\" and that \"Vikram has given a controlled performance as the troubled, confused, yet loving husband.\" The film was later re-shot and released in Tamil as \"Kanden Seethaiyai\" with a comedy track separately shot with Vivek added in.\n"}

{"id": "13920022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13920022", "title": "Andean textiles", "text": "Andean textiles\n\nAndean textiles represent a continuing textile tradition spanning from the Pre-Columbian era to the Colonial era and present day. Textiles have encompassed a variety of functions, including woven textiles for ceremonial clothing, cloth armour, and record-keeping. Cultural emphasis in the textile arts is often based on the spiritual and metaphysical qualities of the origins of material, as well as cosmological and symbolic messages carried by its visual appearance.\n\nArid desert conditions along the coast of Peru have preserved dyed textiles dating as old as 6000 years. Most surviving samples of woven textiles exist as funerary bundles. The textile arts were also instrumental in military and utilitarian use, both as armor and as diplomatic tools and exchanged during interpolitical negotiations. Textiles are also used as a medium of communication, indicating a person's social status and regional affiliation.\n\nTraditionally, thread used for textiles was spun from indigenous cotton plants, as well as alpaca and llama wool. Synthetic threads have since replaced most animal fibers in modern textile arts.\n\nThe earliest known surviving textiles are samples of fiberwork found in Guitarrero Cave, Peru dating back to 8000 BCE. Early fiberwork by the Norte Chico civilization consisted of plant fibers that were intertwined and knotted to form baskets and other containers. Surviving examples of finely spun thread and simple cloths indicate that knowledge of spinning and weaving had already been well-established and developed in the area.\n\nMummified human skeletons dating to this period were stuffed with plant fibers and wrapped in rope and cane, a preservation method invented in the Chilean Chinchoros area around 5000 BC. Existence of this technology demonstrates early knowledge of spinning naturally occurring fibers into cord.\n\nCoastal civilizations were the first to create fishnets, and were the first to utilize the openwork tradition in knotted objects. The fishnets were created through twining, a non-loom technique similar to macramé. Knotting patterns depicting standing humans, parrots, snakes, and cats have been decoded from surviving fragments.\n\nThe introduction of camelid herding for their meat, fibrous hair, and ability to transport cargo was developed in response to remarkably inhospitable environmental conditions found in Andean highlands. As a result, alpacas and llamas were revered for their hardiness and ability to provide resources in both life and death. The scaly fibers produced by these animals were both flexible and dye-permeable, allowing them to be woven with cotton to produce sturdy threads and textiles.Chavín culture began to emerge around the late Initial Period (c. 900-500 BC). Surviving textiles found from looted burials feature brown dye painted on large, seamed panels of cloth. Textiles from the burials of Karwa are featured as ritual cult center objects, and depict explicitly feminine deities. The Chavín culture may have demonstrated the first extensive production of textiles for ritualistic and symbolic purposes.\n\nParacas culture rapidly developed the textile industry into a time-intensive and labor-consuming practice. Embroidered and woven textiles became commonplace, featuring consistent repetition and variation of motifs. Nonwoven fabric structures, such as headbands, were created through cross-knit looping. Paracas officials adopted the practice of wearing multiple garments in sets, including headbands, turbans, mantles, ponchos, tunics, skirts, and loincloths.\n\nWari fiber arts featured large-scale textiles created in state-sponsored workshops. Political messages of abundance and control were depicted using chaotic geometric imagery and camelid-like figures. Examples of surviving imagery (see image) feature multiple repeating motifs of highly geometric patterns, punctuated with highly expressive color palettes. Scholars have argued that the complexity of such designs broadcast the abilities and abundances of state-controlled resources.\n\nMany textiles, such as baskets and fishing nets, did not require the use of a loom. The Andeans used the back strap loom to create woven textiles, as chronicled in El primer nueva corónica y buen gobierno. Several techniques were used to produce fabric, including plain weave, tapestry weave, and scroll weave. Smaller woven pieces produced on the same loom were often stitched together to create a larger fabric. Borders of embroidered tunics and mantles are often decorated with yarn tassels or fringe.\n\nPrehistoric Andean weavers pioneered new weaving techniques, such as the triple weave and quadruple weave. The use of fine yarn and consistency in stitch size is remarkable, with analyses counting an average of 250 wefts per inch on average, and some samples exceeding 500 wefts per inch. This is attributed to the regularity in diameter and consistency of thread, as well as maintenance of tension on the loom throughout the entire weaving process.\n\nA combination of cotton and dyed camelid threads contribute structural strength and colorful visual imagery to textiles. The scaly hair of camelids is permeable to dye, allowing natural plant-based dyes to be fixed to camelid fibers in the presence of a natural mordant, such as urine. Complex combinations of coloration and patterning were used to repeat geometric patterns while maintaining visual consistency; Paracas textiles are especially well known for their regular gridlike arrangement of iconographic images. The consistency of scale and shape of these patterns point to the use of counting systems used by textile artisans to record the number of stitches and distance between each geometric pattern.\n\nSeveral different methods of embroidery are attributed to distinctive styles of coloring and depiction of images in woven textiles. Block color, linear, and broad line styles of embroidery imparted different visual effects upon the woven textile, and were used to convey different types of information. Designs were also painted directly onto woven textiles using various dyes (see figure).\n\nProfessional textile artisans in pre-Incan cultures often worked in large workshops with artisans in several specialties. Proximity to other artisans allowed for additional features to be incorporated into plain weave textiles, including metallic threads, knotted strings of feathers, and brocading. Textile painting was common practice in the preparation of special cloths for funerary bundles of high-ranking members of society. Pigments such as ochre and cinnabar have been used for painting textiles since the Early Horizon period.\n\nIntricately woven mantles were created to be worn by nobles and elites, both in life and death. Mantles were often extensive and large, averaging 275 centimeters in length and 130 centimeters in width, and were draped around the neck and over the shoulders. Women fastened fabrics at the front of the body with a \"tupu\", or shawl pin. The size of the mantle and foreshortening effects of imagery contributed to the appearance of the wearer as being \"larger than life,\" serving as explicit status symbols.\n\nBright dyes served to distinguish social elite from those of lesser status, as undyed fabric worn by commoners was brown. Chinchero officers wore red ponchos to signify rank during formal government occasions. Inca rulers wore a \"llautu\", or tasseled red fringe, on their forehead to demonstrate their status.\n\nGifts were also given to conquered territories in ceremonial shows of dominance over the peoples of the region. A region's ability to produce textiles was intricately connected to its success of camelid herding, indicating the value of state-controlled wealth in a territory.\n\nWoven garments worn during life indicated an individual's social rank, and were often interred with the individual in death. Gift textiles created expressly for funerary purposes were also interred, without being worn in life. Ritual gift objects wrapped in \"mummy bundles\" include obsidian knives, combs, and balls of thread.\n\nParacas culture practiced mummification by wrapping the deceased in several layers of woven textiles. Over 429 funeral bundles containing gift textiles, reams of plain cloth, and various ritual paraphernalia have been excavated from a necropolis at Cerro Colorado. These artifacts offer the largest source of pre-Columbian Andean textile arts known to date.\n\nWhile Andean civilizations had knowledge of and were capable of working metal, quilted armor was preferred for its light weight and flexibility. Soldiers depicted by Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala wear cloth tunics and wind strips of fabric around themselves to create a sturdy armor that allowed for movement while providing defense. The use of cloth rather than metallic armor was also motivated by cultural reasons. The properties of cloth were believed to transfer spiritual reinforcement and power to its wearer, supplying strength and force.\n\nFor similar reasons, woven slings made of plant fibers were the preferred weapons of Moche civilization, rather than stiff wooden or metallic implements. Cloth blankets and tent-making equipment were readily transportable, allowing caches of resources to be delivered to battle frontiers. Storage warehouses containing cloth equipment have been excavated throughout Tawantin Suyu. Defeated armies forced to retreat often burned all cloth unable to be carried, preventing enemy forces from capturing these valuable stashes.\n\nThe Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire resulted in the immigration of Spanish settlers to on the Andean coast. Middle- and upper-class Spanish families recognized the value of finely woven native textiles, and demanded luxury textiles to decorate their own homes. As a result, \"cumbi\", a fine tapestry cloth woven from alpaca fibers, was modified to a Spanish color palette and produced for the homes and churches of settlers. The term \"tornasol\" refers to the style of textile absorbed by Andean weavers after the European context, characterized by a silky texture that appears to change color from different perspectives.\n\nNative weavers modified their technique to produce common items for their colonial audience. Bedcovers, table covers, rugs, and wall hangings became popular textile formats in the late 18th century. European influences introduced lace-inspired borders and stylized circular patterns.\n\nWhile garments had traditionally been brightly colored and highly patterned, the garments worn by highland Andeans during the Colonial period were characteristically plain and black. This has been interpreted as an act of mourning for the lost Inca empire, but may also be a result of cultural influence imported by arriving Spanish colonists.\n\n\n\n"}

She is generally recognized for her study and research on aesthetics, feminism, and emotion theory.\n\nCarolyn received her Ph.D. from Brown University in 1972. In 1978, she began working as a professor of Philosophy at the University of Buffalo where she continues to work today as the Head of the Philosophy Department. Since beginning her career at the University of Buffalo, Korsmeyer has been recognized multiple times for her outstanding performance and continued achievements for her work both in and away from Philosophy. During her long career, Korsmeyer has published multiple acclaimed articles and books on feminism and aesthetics.\n\nAfter receiving her PhD in 1972, Korsmeyer began to focus her research on feminist philosophy and the field of aesthetics. Feminist perspectives in aesthetics has long been major work of Korsmeyer. Fine art, genius, beauty, taste, and aesthetic perception are gendered issues that she has studied and researched.\n\nThe philosophy of taste is a relatively new subject in the field of philosophy, however Korsmeyer's study of \"bad taste\" is well known. Her consideration of taste in philosophy explores why pungent food like soured milk, fried bugs, extremely hot peppers, and game meat are seen as strong and complex to our palettes. A theoretical understanding of taste of food is compared to the philosophy and interpretation of art in that both deem the similar qualities that entail discriminating perception and also that food and art are both considered 'artistic in creation.' The argument Korsmeyer presents is that these \"cosmopolitan foods\" are so complex that they lie on a nearly transparent line straddling between the sublime and disgusting and, when the brain is given the choice, usually the positive reaction wins. Thus, these seemingly disgusting foods give a positive aesthetic response. \nHer publications on the subject include: \n\nFeminist aesthetics refers to the idea that in their basic form, classic concepts such as genius, beauty, fine art, aesthetic perception cradle social roles are qualities that are presumed as gender related. In her most notorious book titled \"Gender and Aesthetics: An Introduction to Understanding Feminist Philosophy\" (London: Routledge, 2004) Korsmeyer uses these \"classic concepts\" to identify their qualities and goes on to explain the weight of gender as the abiding attribute.

Like his mentor, William-Adolphe Bouguereau, he was an academic painter and painted realistic portraits as well as mythological and religious scenes. His artistic career was so prestigious that he won the Prix de Rome twice and was awarded the \"Légion d'honneur\".\n\nLenoir was born in Châtellaillon, a small town just outside La Rochelle. His mother was a seamstress and his father was a customs officer. When he was young, his father was reassigned and the family moved to Fouras. He did not start out in life as an artist, but instead began his education at a teachers' college in La Rochelle. Upon graduation, he worked as a teacher and supervisor at the \"lycée\" in Rochefort.\n\nIn August 1883 he was accepted into the École des Beaux-Arts de Paris. He also joined the Académie Julian where he was a student of William-Adolphe Bouguereau and Tony Robert-Fleury. Lenoir made his artistic debut at the Salon in 1887 and continued to exhibit there until his death. He was quickly noticed in the art world, and in 1889 won the Second Prix de Rome for his painting, \"Jésus et le paralytique\" (\"Jesus and a Sick Man with Palsy\"), and he won the First Prix de Rome the following year for \"Le Reniement de Saint Pierre\" (\"The Denial of St. Peter\").\n\nHis awards did not stop with the Prix de Rome; works shown at the Salons also won prizes, and he received a third-class medal in 1892 for \"Le Grenier a Vingt Ans\" (\"The Garret at twenty years\") and a second-class medal in 1896 for \"La Mort de Sappho\" (\"The Death of Sappho\"). In 1900, he won a bronze medal at the world's fair in Paris for \"Le Calme\" (\"The Calm\"), a painting of his new wife, Eugénie Lucchesi.\n\nIn tribute to his lasting appeal, Lenoir was appointed a Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur in 1903. He kept a house in Fouras and returned every summer. He died there and was buried on 1 August 1926. In order to commemorate him, a monument was erected there in 1937 which stands to this day.\n\n"}

{"id": "469691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=469691", "title": "Destiny", "text": "Destiny\n\nDestiny, sometimes referred to as fate (from Latin \"fatum\" – destiny), is a predetermined course of events. It may be conceived as a predetermined future, whether in general or of an individual.\n\nAlthough often used interchangeably, the words \"fate\" and \"destiny\" have distinct connotations.\n\n\nFortune differs terminologically from destiny and fate in that it has more to do with specific occurrences and outcomes, whereas destiny ultimately revolves around death rather than the events of one’s life. In Hellenistic civilization, the chaotic and unforeseeable turns of chance gave increasing prominence to a previously less notable goddess, Tyche (literally \"Luck\"), who embodied the good fortune of a city and all whose lives depended on its security and prosperity, two good qualities of life that appeared to be out of human reach. The Roman image of Fortuna, with the wheel she blindly turned, was retained by Christian writers, revived strongly in the Renaissance and survives in some forms today.\n\nPhilosophy on the concepts of destiny and fate has existed since the Hellenistic period with groups such as the Stoics and the Epicureans.\n\nThe Stoics believed that human decisions and actions ultimately went according to a divine plan devised by a god. They claimed that although humans theoretically have free will, their souls and the circumstances under which they live are all part of the universal network of fate.\n\nThe Epicureans challenged the Stoic beliefs by denying the existence of this divine fate. They believed that a human's actions were voluntary so long as they were rational.\n\nIn daily language, \"destiny\" and \"fate\" are synonymous, but with regard to 19th-century philosophy, the words gained inherently different meanings.\n\nFor Arthur Schopenhauer, destiny was just a manifestation of the Will to Live, which can be at the same time living fate and choice of overrunning fate, by means of the Art, of the Morality and of the Ascesis.\n\nFor Friedrich Nietzsche, destiny keeps the form of \"Amor fati\" (Love of Fate) through the important element of Nietzsche's philosophy, the \"will to power\" (der \"Wille zur Macht\"), the basis of human behavior, influenced by the Will to Live of Schopenhauer. But this concept may have even other senses, although he, in various places, saw the will to power as a strong element for adaptation or survival in a better way. Nietzsche eventually transformed the idea of matter as centers of force into matter as centers of will to power as humanity's destiny to face with \"amor fati\". The expression \"Amor fati\" is used repeatedly by Nietzsche as acceptation-choice of the \"fate\", but in such way it becomes even another thing, precisely a \"choice\" destiny.\n\nDeterminism is a philosophical concept often confused with fate, it can be defined as the notion that all intents/actions are \"causally\" determined by the culminations of an agent's existing circumstances; simply put, everything that happens is determined by things that have already happened. Determinism differs from fate in that it is never conceived as being a spiritual, religious, nor astrological notion; fate is typically thought of as being \"given\" or \"decreed\" while determinism is \"caused.\" Influential philosophers like Robert Kane (philosopher), Thomas Nagel, Roderick Chisholm, and A.J. Ayer have written about this notion.\n\nThe idea of a god controlled destiny plays an important role in numerous religions.\n\n\nHistorically and globally, fate has played a large role in several literary works. In ancient Greece, many legends and tales teach the futility of trying to outmaneuver an inexorable fate that has been correctly predicted. This portrayal of fate is present in works such as \"Oedipus Rex\" (427 BCE), the \"Iliad,\" the \"Odyssey\" (800 BCE), and \"Theogony.\" Many ancient Chinese works have also portrayed the concept of fate, most notably the \"Liezi,\" \"Mengzi,\" and the \"Zhuangzi.\" Similarly, and in Italy, the Spanish Duque de Rivas' play that Verdi transformed into \"La Forza del Destino\" (\"The Force of Destiny\") includes notions of fate. In England, fate has played a notable literary role in Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\" (1606), Thomas Hardy's \"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\" (1891), Samuel Beckett's \"Endgame\" (1957), and W.W Jacobs' popular short story \"The Monkey's Paw\" (1902). In America, Thornton Wilder's book \"The Bridge of San Luis Rey\" (1927) portrays the conception of fate. In Germany, fate is a recurring theme in the literature of Hermann Hesse (1877–1962), including \"Siddharta\" (1922) and his magnum opus, \"Das Glasperlenspiel,\" also published as \"The Glass Bead Game\" (1943). And by Hollywood through such characters as Neo in \"The Matrix\". The common theme of these works involves a protagonist who cannot escape their destiny, however hard they try.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32900203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32900203", "title": "Funky Bones", "text": "Funky Bones\n\nFunky Bones is a public artwork by Atelier Van Lieshout, a Dutch artist collective led by Joep van Lieshout, located in the , which is on the grounds of the Indianapolis Museum of Art in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States. The artwork, primarily made from fiberglass, consists of twenty white and black bone-shaped benches.\n\n\"Funky Bones\" is situated in the Meadow region just south of the lake at 100 Acres. It is a site-specific artwork consisting of twenty white bone-shaped benches inscribed with black drawings of bones that together form a large stylized human skeleton. The artwork was constructed primarily from fiberglass, plywood, and concrete. Each bench is a fiberglass shell filled with a lightweight foam material. The fiberglass surface has been impregnated with pigment, carved, and coated in polyester resin. Plywood was used only during the detailing process of the black bone segments and is not visible in the completed artwork. The concrete component for this artwork is not visible but rather serves as a structural aid, anchoring and securing the individual benches into the ground. A standard ready-mix concrete was used for this application.\n\nThe skeleton is positioned with its arms spread out horizontally while the legs point straight down. The individual benches range in both length and width, but all are approximately 26\" in height. The artwork was fabricated in Atelier Van Lieshout's studio in Rotterdam and shipped to the Indianapolis Museum of Art where it was installed by the design and installation crew.\n\n\"Funky Bones\" was installed at the Indianapolis Museum of Art in May 2010 and is currently on temporary loan. The artwork arose from many disparate interests of Joep van Lieshout, the founder and head designer of AVL. These include human anatomy and the history of the site. Concerning the original concept and inspiration behind \"Funky Bones\", Joep van Lieshout stated:\n\nIn addition to resonating with the location's history, \"Funky Bones\" also has the functional purpose of providing an ideal spot for visitors to sit, picnic, lounge, or climb. Joep van Lieshout observed visitors sitting on rocks during visits to the site, and decided to provide them with more comfortable seating arrangements in order to facilitate interaction, both among viewers as well as between viewer and art. This degree of interactivity, and even fun, makes \"Funky Bones\" extremely child-friendly.\n\nAtelier Van Lieshout (AVL) is a multidisciplinary company that operates internationally in the field of contemporary art, design, and architecture. Joep van Lieshout (born 1963), founder of AVL, is a Dutch artist born in Ravenstein, The Netherlands. He received his formal education and training from the Academy of Modern Art in Rotterdam (1980–1985), Ateliers '63 in Haarlem (1985-1987), and from the Villa Arson in Nice, France (1987). Joep van Lieshout formed the AVL studio group in 1995 in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, where the company continues to design and fabricate their widely exhibited works. Atelier Van Lieshout has attained international recognition for objects-based projects that balance on the boundary between art, architecture and design. Recurring themes in the work of AVL include self-sufficiency, power, politics, and the more classical themes of life and death. The name Atelier Van Lieshout emphasizes the fact that, although Joep van Lieshout founded and leads the collective, the work produced stems from the creative impulses of the entire team.\n\nFor \"Funky Bones,\" AVL's most relevant recurring themes are domestication, politics, complex functioning systems, and the re-contextualization of familiar, domestic objects. The Atelier van Lieshout claims to make no distinction between \"real artworks\" and \"just building something for someone.\" The studio group focuses on creating artworks whose design principles challenge conventional ideas of utility and functionality by reinventing how the viewer perceives or approaches an object and the environment in which it is placed. This is achieved by the implementation of non-traditional materials and color palettes, odd or unusual subject matter, and through the strategic positioning or locale of the artwork. \"Funky Bones\" is impossible to see in its entirety except at a distance, preferably from above. Moving close enough to actually interact with it produces an entirely different perspective.\n\nIn general, the bones require regular cleaning in order to maintain their white color. Instrumental analysis involving the artwork's color and gloss levels has been recorded for future reference.\n\nIn the book \"The Fault in Our Stars\", by Indianapolis-based author John Green, the sculpture is the location of a romantic picnic, having been picked by one of the characters as being the most Dutch place in Indianapolis. \"Funky Bones\" was recreated in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for the film adaptation of \"The Fault in Our Stars\". The recreation was built by set designers, with help from the artist and Sarah Urist Green, wife of John Green, and former Curator of Contemporary Art at the Indianapolis Museum of Art.\n\n\n"}

The original campaign ran for twelve 45-second instalments between 1987 and 1993. It starred Anthony Head and Sharon Maughan as Tony and Sharon, a couple who begin a slow-burning romance over a cup of the advertised coffee. The ads were in a serial format, with each ad ending on a cliffhanger. The commercials were extremely popular, and as time went on, the appearance of a new instalment would merit considerable media attention. The ads were developed by McCann Erickson. They are one of the most famous examples of serialized advertising.\n\nBeginning in 1990, new versions of the ads were produced for the American market, where Gold Blend was called \"Taster's Choice,\" and the ads were referred to as the \"Taster's Choice saga\". Head and Maughan reprised their roles, but used American accents in the reshot ads. After the first two nearly identical ads, the American ads diverged into their own storyline.\n\nThe campaign was a remarkable success, producing various tie-in products, including a novelization entitled \"Love Over Gold\" by Susan Moody, a video compilation of the ads, and two music CDs. The ads had a notable effect on sales, increasing them over 50% in the UK alone. They have been heralded as a premier example of positioning, creating an atmosphere of sophistication while remaining relatable. They were frequently compared to a soap opera, even sometimes favorably compared to their contemporaries, such as \"Dynasty\", \"Moonlighting\", or \"thirtysomething\". Famously, Head and Maughan appeared on the cover of \"The Sun\" after their campaign concluded and the two characters confessed their love for each other.\n\nIn later years, there were two additional series of ads starring new couples. The second series starred Louise Hunt and Mark Aiken and focused on a younger, more career-oriented woman, running for six instalments until 1997. In 1998, a new version with Simone Bendix and Neil Roberts began, but the campaign was discontinued after only one ad.\n\nIn 2005, the campaign ranked at number 20 on \"ITV's Best Ever Ads\". It had ranked at number 31 in a similar list compiled in 2000 aired on Channel 4.\n\n\n"}

Baen Books and Flint decline the distinction, counting this book as the sixth published work. Overall it is also the third anthology in printed publication in the atypical series which consists of a mish-mash of main novels and anthologies produced under popular demand after publication of the initial novel which was written as a stand-alone work.\n\nAnne Jefferson and Harry Lefferts pose for Rembrandt as part of a complex political situation.\n\nHans Richter's flying instructor is still heartsore over his loss.

Instead, Mike Stearns hires a mercenary troop run by an Englishman and an Irishman.\n\nA string of mishaps keeps a Finnish cavalryman from action against the Croats attacking Grantville's high school, while an uptime German is uniquely positioned to pick off attackers.\n\nDown-time German Lutheran pastor Steffan Schultheiss in Badenburg is wary of the citizens of Grantville shortly after its appearance due to their modern views on religion; in which he warns his flock against Grantville in order to keep their modern progressing influence from corrupting his congregation. However, Schultheiss's religious warnings were not heeded due to politics and economics both made Grantville attractive to Badenburg. Schultheiss continued to condemn Grantville's practices until his outcries infuriated his wife, who has a positive view on Grantville. Eventually, with guidance from his wife, Schultheiss changed his stance on Grantville and becomes more tolerated on the Americans' ideals, including freedom of religion.\n\nThe story is a police procedural that follows two policemen Jurgen Neubert, a down-time farmer and former mercenary soldier turned cop, and Marvin Tipton, a long service cop, through a murder case.\n\n\"An Invisible War\" is a short novel that was the first serialized piece of longer fiction that spanned this and the next Gazette in their e-published versions—though the whole (110 pages) was published in the hardcover release of \"Grantville Gazette II\".

To add impetus and urgency, as time goes by in the experience of Grantville, some of the historical research conducted in the two libraries reveals that plague outbreaks occurred locally in OTL in diverse regions during 1632, 1634, and 1635 saw a large epidemic-size outbreak. Worse, the historical record might also indicate other outbreaks, which were poorly documented.\n\nThe story is one of Grantville's medical personnel meeting head-on with down-timer University practices, prejudices and a college curricula based in large part on the Classics and Theological studies.

In the early hours, guards admitted two men posing as police officers responding to a disturbance call. Once inside, the thieves tied up the guards and over the next hour committed the largest-value recorded theft of private property in history. Despite efforts by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and multiple probes around the world, no arrests have been made and no works have been recovered. The museum initially offered a reward of $5 million for information leading to the art's recovery, but in 2017 this was temporarily doubled to $10 million, with an expiration date set to the end of the year. This was extended into 2018 following helpful tips from the public.\n\nThe stolen works had originally been purchased by art collector Isabella Stewart Gardner (1840–1924) and intended to be left on permanent display at the museum with the rest of her collection. Since the collection and its layout are permanent, empty frames remain hanging both in homage to the missing works and as placeholders for their potential return. Experts are puzzled by the choice of paintings that were stolen, especially since more valuable artwork was left untouched. Among the stolen works was \"The Concert\", one of only 34 known works by Vermeer and thought to be the most valuable unrecovered painting, valued at over $200 million. Also missing is \"The Storm on the Sea of Galilee\", Rembrandt's only known seascape. Other works by Rembrandt, Degas, Manet, and Flinck were also stolen.\n\nAccording to the FBI, the stolen artwork was moved through the region and offered for sale in Philadelphia during the early 2000s. They believe the thieves were members of a criminal organization based in the mid-Atlantic and New England. They also claim to have targeted two suspects, although they have not been publicly identified and are now deceased. Boston gangster Bobby Donati, murdered in 1991 as a result of ongoing gang wars, has been cited as a possible collaborator in the heist. Significant evidence suggests that Hartford, Connecticut gangster Robert Gentile knows the location of the works, although he denies involvement.\n\nAround midnight on Sunday morning, March 18, 1990, a red Dodge Daytona pulled up near the side entrance of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum along Palace Road. Two men with fake police uniforms waited for at least an hour in the car, possibly trying to avoid being noticed by people leaving a Saint Patrick's Day party nearby. Later at around 1a.m., security guard Richard Abath returned to the front desk after patrolling the museum to switch positions with a fellow guard, the only other person in the building. At this time, Abath opened and quickly shut the Palace Road door, claiming he was trained to do this to ensure the door was locked. He claimed security logs from other nights would show that he had done this many times previously. The FBI has seized the logs, but has not commented on the issue further.\n\nAt 1:24a.m., one of the two men outside pushed the buzzer near the door and told Abath they were policemen who heard of a disturbance in the courtyard, and requested to be let inside. Abath knew he should not let uninvited guests inside, but he was unsure on whether the rule applied to police officers. He could see the men and believed them to be police officers based on their uniforms. With his partner on patrol, Abath decided to buzz in the men. When the intruders arrived at the main security desk, one of them told Abath that he looked familiar and there was a default warrant out for his arrest. Abath stepped out from behind his desk, where the only alarm button to alert police could be accessed. He was quickly asked for his ID, ordered to face the wall, and then handcuffed. Abath believed the arrest was a misunderstanding, until he realized he hadn't been frisked before being cuffed, and one officer's mustache was made of wax. The second security guard arrived minutes later and was also handcuffed, after which he asked the intruders why he was being arrested. The thieves explained that they were not being arrested, but rather this was a robbery, and proceeded to take the guards to the museum's basement. They handcuffed the guards to pipes and wrapped duct tape around their hands, feet, and heads.\n\nSince the museum was equipped with motion detectors, the thieves' movements throughout the museum were recorded. After tying up the guards, the thieves went upstairs to the Dutch Room. As one of them approached Rembrandt's \"Self-Portrait\" (1629), a local alarm sounded, which they immediately smashed. They pulled the painting off the wall and attempted to take the wooden panel out of its heavy frame. Unsuccessful at the attempt, they left the painting on the floor. They cut Rembrandt's \"The Storm on the Sea of Galilee\" out of the frame, as well as \"A Lady and Gentleman in Black\". They also removed Vermeer's \"The Concert\" and Govaert Flinck's \"Landscape with Obelisk\" from their frames. Additionally, they also took a Chinese bronze gu from the Shang dynasty.\n\nElsewhere in the museum, they stole five Degas drawings and an eagle finial. The finial sat at the top of a Napoleonic flag, which they attempted to unscrew from the wall, but failed. Manet's \"Chez Tortoni\" was also stolen from its location in the Blue Room. Motion detector records show that the only footsteps detected in the Blue Room that night were at 12:27a.m. and again at 12:53a.m. These times match to when Abath said he passed through on patrol. The frame for the painting was found on security chief Lyle W. Grindle's chair near the front desk. The thieves made two trips to their car with artwork during the theft, which lasted 81 minutes. Before leaving, they visited the guards once more, telling them \"You'll be hearing from us in about a year,\" although they were never heard from again. The guards remained handcuffed until police arrived at 8:15a.m. later that morning.\n\nAltogether, thirteen pieces were stolen at an estimated loss of $500 million, making the robbery the largest recorded private property theft in history. Empty frames remain hanging in the museum, both in homage to the missing works and as placeholders for their potential return. One of the paintings, \"The Concert\", was Gardner's first major acquisition and one of only 34 known Vermeer works in the world. It is thought to be the most valuable unrecovered stolen painting, with a value estimated at over $200 million. Another painting, \"The Storm on the Sea of Galilee\", is Rembrandt's only known seascape. The bronze finial was taken from the top of a Napoleonic flag, possibly appearing like gold to the thieves. The museum is offering a $100,000 reward for this piece alone.\n\nThe following are the missing works of art:\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation took control of the case on the grounds that the artwork would likely cross state lines. They have conducted hundreds of interviews with probes stretching across the world involving Scotland Yard, Japanese and French authorities, private investigators, museum directors, and art dealers. The FBI believes the thieves were members of a criminal organization based in the mid-Atlantic and New England, and that the stolen paintings were moved through Connecticut and the Philadelphia area in the years following the theft. Some of the art may have been offered for sale in Philadelphia in the early 2000s, including \"The Storm on the Sea of Galilee\"; however, their knowledge of what happened to the works after the attempted sale is limited. The FBI stated it believed it knew the identity of the thieves in 2013, but in 2015 announced that they were now deceased. They have declined to identify the individuals.\nNo single motive or pattern has emerged through the thousands of pages of evidence gathered. The selection of works puzzles the experts, specifically since more valuable artworks were available. The FBI's lead agent assigned to the case, Geoffrey J. Kelly, finds it difficult to understand why this assortment of items was stolen despite the thieves being in the museum for enough time to take whatever they wished. On their way to the finial, the thieves passed by two Raphaels and a Botticelli painting. Titian's \"The Rape of Europa\", which is one of the museum's most well-known and valuable pieces, was not stolen. Due to the brutish ways the criminals handled the robbery, cutting the paintings from their frames and smashing frames for two Degas sketches, investigators believe the thieves were amateur criminals, not experts commissioned to steal particular works. Some investigators believe the works were destroyed, explaining why they have not reappeared. Theories on the theft include that it was organized by the Irish Republican Army in order to raise money or bargain for the release of imprisoned comrades. Another theory states Whitey Bulger was the ringleader of the theft. At the time of the heist, he was Boston's top crime boss and an FBI informant.\n\nThe museum first offered a reward of $1 million, but that was later increased to $5 million in 1997. The reward is for \"information that leads directly to the recovery of all of [their] items in good condition\", which remains on offer more than a quarter-century later. In May 2017, the bounty was doubled to $10 million, with an expiration date set for midnight on December 31 of that year. This reward was extended into 2018 following an outpouring of tips from the public. Federal authorities have stated they will not charge anyone who voluntarily turns in the artwork, but anyone caught knowingly in possession of stolen items could be prosecuted. The thieves cannot face charges because the five-year statute of limitations has expired.\n\nIn 2010, the FBI announced that some evidence from the original crime scene had been sent to the FBI's Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, for retesting with the hope of finding new DNA evidence to identify the culprits of the theft.\n\nIn June 2017, \"The Boston Globe\" reported that some of the crime scene evidence collected by the FBI was missing. Even after an exhaustive search, they were unable to locate handcuffs and duct tape used to immobilize the museum's two security guards that could have contained traces of the thieves' DNA material.\n\nIn 1994, the museum director Anne Hawley received a letter that promised the return of the pieces for $2.6 million. If interested, the museum had to get \"The Boston Globe\" to publish a coded message in a business story. The message was published, but nothing further was heard once law enforcement got involved.\n\nLate one night in 1997, \"Boston Herald\" reporter Tom Mashberg was driven to a warehouse in Red Hook, Brooklyn by William Youngworth, a career criminal and associate of New England art thief Myles Connor Jr., to see what was purported to be \"The Storm on the Sea of Galilee\". Mashberg had been investigating the theft and was briefly allowed to view the painting with a flashlight. He was given a vial of paint chips for authenticity. These were later confirmed by experts to be fragments of Dutch 17th-century origin—but not from the stolen painting. It was never concretely determined to be real or fake, and the FBI quit dealing with Youngworth after not making any progress. The painting has since disappeared.\nOn August 6, 2015, police released a video from the night before the theft that is believed to show a dry run of the robbery. Two men appear on the tape: one remains unidentified, while the other has been confirmed as Richard Abath, a security guard on duty the night of the heist. The video appears to show Abath buzzing the unidentified man into the museum twice within a few minutes. The man stayed for about three minutes in the lobby, then returned to a car and drove off. Police say the video opens new lines of investigation, and \"The New York Times\" points out that it draws new attention to Abath as a potential collaborator. However, the guards had previously been interviewed and deemed too unimaginative to have pulled off the heist – which is not to say they could not have been collaborators.\n\nIn December 2015 FBI agents searched East Boston's Suffolk Downs horse racing track, acting on a tip consistent with rumors among Suffolk Downs employees in the 1990s that the stolen art was there. Stables, parts of the grandstand closed since the early 1990s, and two safes (which had to be drilled open) were searched without result.\n\nBoston gangster Bobby Donati may have been involved in the heist. New England art thief Myles J. Connor Jr., in prison at the time of the robbery, has stated that he and associate Bobby Donati eyed the museum in the 1980s and Donati oversaw the operation. Shortly before the robbery, Donati was seen at a nightclub with a sack of police uniforms. Donati worked under Boston crime boss Vincent Ferrara, and visited him in prison in the early 1990s. When Ferrara asked about the robbery, Donati said he \"buried the stuff\" and would find a way to negotiate his release. Donati was murdered in 1991 as a result of ongoing gang wars.\n\nHartford, Connecticut, gangster Robert \"Bobby the Cook\" Gentile has been suggested on multiple occasions as knowing the location of the Gardner works. In May 2012, FBI agents searched Gentile's home in Manchester, Connecticut. They did not find any stolen works, despite searching his preferred hiding spot beneath a false floor with the help of his son. However, in the basement, they found a sheet of paper listing what each stolen piece might draw on the black market. In January 2016, the FBI contrived gun charges against Gentile to force him to reveal the location of the missing works. During a hearing, a federal prosecutor revealed significant evidence tying Gentile to the crime. The prosecutor stated that Gentile and mob partner Robert Guarente attempted to use the return of two stolen pieces to reduce a prison sentence for one of their associates. Guarente's wife told investigators in early 2015 that her husband once had possession of some of the art, and gave two paintings to Gentile before Guarente died of cancer in 2004. Also, while in federal prison during 2013–2014, Gentile told at least three people he had knowledge of the stolen art. In 2015, Gentile submitted to a lie detector test, denying advanced knowledge of the heist or ever possessing any paintings. The result showed a 0.1% chance that he was truthful. According to Gentile's lawyer, federal agents are convinced that Gentile has the stolen works. Gentile's home was searched again by the FBI on May 2, 2016, even though his lawyer insists that if Gentile had the stolen artwork or knowledge of its whereabouts, he would have turned it in for the reward money a long time ago. On September 5, 2017, Gentile was scheduled to be sentenced for a separate weapons charge in Connecticut.\n\nWhen the museum raised its bounty in 1997, Myles J. Connor Jr. said he could locate the missing artwork in exchange for legal immunity. Authorities rejected his offer. Connor now believes that the Gardner works have passed into other, unknown hands. \"I was probably told, but I don't remember,\" he said, blaming a heart attack that affected his memory. Louis Royce, another Boston area gangster, claims he is still owed 15% for devising the plan for two fake policemen to request access to the museum at night.\n\nThe high profile Gardner Museum theft has been referenced and parodied in many different works. It was the subject of the 2005 documentary \"Stolen\", which first appeared in a slightly different version on Court TV. The more well-known paintings have been referenced in multiple TV shows, including \"The Blacklist\" episode \"The Courier\" (and an allusion to the Gardner Museum heist itself in the episode \"Greyson Blaise\"), \"The Simpsons\" episode \"American History X-cellent\", \"Drunk History\" episode \"Boston\", and \"American Greed\".\n\nSeveral books were written by former investigators: \"Artful Deception\" (2012) by James J. McGovern; \"Priceless: How I Went Undercover to Rescue the World's Stolen Treasures\" (2010), by Robert Wittman and John Shiffman; and \"Stolen Masterpiece Tracker\" (2006) by Thomas McShane.\n\nStephen Kurkjian, a reporter for \"The Boston Globe\", has written a book about his experience titled \"Master Thieves: The Boston Gangsters Who Pulled Off the World's Greatest Art Heist\" (2015). Journalist Ulrich Boser wrote a book called \"The Gardner Heist\" (2009), leaning heavily on the documented investigation of Harold Smith, an insurance underwriter who worked on art cases.\n\nThe theft features in the novel \"The Art Forger\" (2012) by B.A. Shapiro.\n\nIn 2018, \"The Boston Globe\" and WBUR-FM launched a podcast exploring the theft, titled \"Last Seen\".\n\n\n"}

He was murdered in the Mauthausen concentration camp.\n\nHašler studied to be a glove-maker, but he became intererested in theatre at a young age and occasionally performed with amateur theatre ensembles. In 1897, following his debut at the \"Aréna Theatre\" he left home and successively joined various travelling theatre companies. In 1902 he became a member of the Slovenian theatre in Ljubljana, but soon moved back to Prague, where he joined the National Theatre ensemble. In the National Theatre, he asserted himself in conversational plays. In addition to that, he also attempted to apply his singing abilities. Around 1908, he started composing his own music, and at the same time he began to incline to cabaret activities. Gradually he became a director and head of various Prague cabarets, such as \"Lucerna\" (1910–1915, 1918–1923), \"Rokoko\" (1915–1918) and \"Karlín Variety Theatre\" (1924–1929). In 1908, he married a sister of pianist and composer Rudolf Friml.\n\nDuring World War I he also began to appear in silent films, as an actor, director and author. In 1914, he made a comedy \"České hrady a zámky\" (Czech Castles), based on his own script. The film was intended as an introduction for the play \"Pán bez kvartýru\" (A Man Without Flat). He appeared also in the comedy \n\"Ahasver\" and in other silent films. \n\nAmong his most successful film roles were the lawyer and deputy Uher in the drama film \"Batalion\" (The Battalion, 1927) by Přemysl Pražský, and the organist in \"Varhaník u sv. Víta\" (Organist at St. Vitus Cathedral, 1929) by Martin Frič. The coming era of the sound film in 1930s enabled Hašler to utilize his singing skills. In his first sound film role \"Písničkář\" (Balladeer, 1932) by Svatopluk Innemann he sang patriotic songs \"Svoboda\" (Freedom) and \"Ta naše písnička česká\" (Our Czech song), among others. In 1942, in his last film role, he played himself in \"Za tichých nocí\" (In the Quiet Nights), made by his son Gina Hašler. From 1932 to 1941 Hašler played in more than 13 films. In September 1941, during production of the film \"Městečko na dlani\", based on the script by Jan Drda, he was arrested by the Gestapo and sent to the Mauthausen concentration camp. The main reason for his arrest was his patriotic songs. In Mauthausen he was tortured to death.\n\nIn the post-war Communist Czechoslovakia he was officially ignored for political reasons, because many of his songs hailed Tomáš Masaryk and Czechoslovak Legionnaires, and mocked interbellum communists.\n\nA popular Czech herbal-menthol hard candy was called \"\" after him. They have been known since early 1900s. Now the trademark is owned by Nestle.\n\n\"Hašlerky\" is a recognizable type of songs, written by Hašler and of similar character.\n\nCzech astronomer Lenka Kotková (née L. Šarounová) named asteroid 37939 Hašler after him.\n\nIn 2008, Czech directors Marek Jícha and Josef Lustig made a documentary \"Písničkář, který nezemřel\" (The Immortal Balladeer of Prague) describing the fate of Hašler's illegitimate son Thomas Hasler.\n\nOn the occasion of Hašler's 130th anniversary (2009) a monument by sculptor Stanislav Hanzík was unveiled at the .\n\nIn 2013 the band Patrola Šlapeto recorded a CD and DVD with 23 Hašler's songs based on original recordings found in musical archives. While there have been plenty recordings of Hasler's songs, this was the first in 80 years recording of the original tunes.\nKarel Hašlers artistic output consists mainly of songs. He created more than 300 compositions, many of which became popular \"folk songs\". With his engaged patriotic approach he helped to strengthen the national consciousness of Czech people during times of danger and oppression. Following his death in the concentration camp, his songs became a symbol of national resistance.\n\nSelected songs\n\nActor:\n\nWriter:\n\nComposer:\n\nMusic Department:\n\nDirector:\n\nSoundtrack:\n\nProducer:\n\n\n"}

It interprets history through a Christian conception of time focused on the narratives of creation, fall, and redemption. It also had a political purpose to justify the Treaty of Pereyaslav which annexed the Cossack Hetmanate to the Tsardom of Russia while also claiming a central role for the city of Kiev.\n\nInnokentiy Gizel is generally considered to be the author of \"Synopsis\", however this is arguable. \"Synopsis\" was the first textbook on the subject of history written in any Slavic language. It was rather popular until the mid-19th century and survived some thirty editions. \n\nThe book began with the history of the origins and lifestyle of the Slavs and ended with the mid-17th century in the first edition. The second and third editions (1678 and 1680) end with the Chigirin Campaigns of 1677-1678. \"Synopsis\" covers the history of Kievan Rus', the Mongol invasion of Rus', and the struggles against the Crimean Tatars, Ottoman Turkey, and Poland. The author of the \"Synopsis\" asserted that the Russian tsars were the legal successors of the Kievan grand princes. \"Synopsis\" is notable since it clearly demonstrates that the idea of uniting all East Slavic people under the authority of one state was born not in Moscow but in the south-western lands of former Kievan Rus' and designed in Kiev.\n\nThe purpose of the work is to \"achieve a precarious balance between glorifying the Muscovite tsar on the one hand and defending Kiev’s own claims to power on the other.\"\n\nThe appendix of the \"Synopsis\" contains lists of Russian princes, Polish Voivodes in Little Russia, Cossack hetmans, and Kievan metropolitans.\n"}

{"id": "1680106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1680106", "title": "Lolita fashion", "text": "Lolita fashion\n\nThe main feature of Lolita fashion is the volume of the skirt, often created by wearing a petticoat or crinoline. The skirt can be either clock-shaped or A-shaped. Components of the Lolita wardrobe consist mainly of a blouse (long or short sleeves) with a skirt or a dress, which usually comes to the knees. Lolitas frequently wear fashion wigs in combination with other headwear such as hair bows or a bonnet (similar to a Poke bonnet). Lolitas sometimes also wear Victorian style drawers under their petticoats. For further effect, knee socks, ankle socks or tights together with either high heels or flat shoes with a bow are worn. Other typical Lolita garments are a jumperskirt (JSK) and one-piece (OP).\n\nAlthough the origin of the fashion is unclear, it is likely that the movement started at the end of the 1960s with the fashion style and subculture Natural Kei, which romanticized the Victorian Period. At the end of the 1970s, this resulted in a new movement known as \"Otome-kei\", which slightly influenced Lolita fashion since \"Otome\" means \"maiden\" and maiden style looks like a lesser elaborated Lolita style. Before Otome-kei emerged, there was already a rise of the cuteness culture in the earlier seventies; during which there was a high emphasis on cute and childish handwriting in Japanese schools. As a result of that the company Sanrio began experimenting with cute designs. The cuteness style, known as \"kawaii style\", became popular in the 1980s. After Otome-kei, Do-It-Yourself behavior became popular, which led to the emergence of a new style called 'doll-kei' the predecessor of Lolita fashion.\n\nIn the years of 1977–1998, a large part of the Harajuku shopping district closed for car traffic on Sundays. The result was an increase in interaction between pedestrians in Harajuku. When brands like (1973), Milk (1970), and Angelic Pretty (1979) began to sell cute clothing, that resulted in a new style, which would later be known as 'Lolita'. The term Lolita first appeared in the fashion magazine \"Ryukou Tsushin\" in the September 1987 issue. Shortly after that Baby, The Stars Shine Bright (1988), Metamorphose temps de fille (1993), and other brands emerged. In the 1990s, Lolita became more accepted, with bands like Malice Mizer and other visualkei rising in popularity. These band members wore elaborate clothes that fans began to adopt. During this time Japan went through an economic depression, leading to an increase in alternative youth and fashion cultures such as gyaru, otaku, visual kei, and Lolita, as well as visualkei inspired clothing such as Mori, Fairy Kei and Decora The Lolita style spread quickly from the Kansai region and finally reached Tokyo, partly due to the economic difficulties there was a big growth in the cuteness and youth cultures that originated in the seventies. In the late nineties, the Jingu Bashi (also called the Harajuku Bridge) became known as meeting place for youth who wore Lolita and other alternative fashion, and Lolita became more popular causing a spurt of Lolita Fashion selling warehouses. Important magazines that contributed to the spread of the fashion style were the \"Gothic & Lolita Bible\" (2001), a spin-off of the popular Japanese fashion magazine \"\" (1998), and \"FRUiTS\" (1997). It was around this time when interest and awareness of Lolita Fashion began entering countries outside of Japan, with The \"Gothic & Lolita Bible\" being translated into English, distributed outside of Japan through the publisher Tokyopop, and \"FRUits\" publishing an English picture book of the Japanese Street Fashion in 2001. As the style became further popularized through the Internet, more shops opened abroad, such as Baby, The Stars Shine Bright in Paris (2007) and in New York (2014).\n\nOver time, the youth that gathered in Harajuku or at Harajuku Bridge disappeared. One possible explanation is that the introduction of fast fashion from retailers H&M and Forever 21 has caused a reduction in the consumption of street fashion. \"FRUiTS\" ceased publication while \"Gothic & Lolita Bible\" was put on hiatus in 2017.\n\nWestern culture has influenced Lolita fashion. The book \"Alice in Wonderland\" (1865), written by Lewis Caroll, has inspired many different brands and top magazines. \"Alice Deco\" being an example of a magazine that is named after the character. The reason that the character Alice was an inspiration source for the Lolita, was because she was an ideal icon for the Shōjo (shoujo)-image, meaning an image of eternal innocence and beauty. The first complete translation of the book was published by Maruyama Eikon in 1910, translated under the title Ai-chan No Yume Monogatari (Fantastic stories of Ai). Another figure from the Roccoco that served as a source of inspiration was Marie Antoinette; a manga \"The Rose of Versailles\" (Lady Oscar) based on her court, was created in 1979.\n\nPeople who have popularized the Lolita fashion were Mana and Novala Takemoto. Novala wrote the light novel \"Kamikaze Girls\" (2002) about the relationship between Momoko, a Lolita girl and Ichigo, a \"Yanki\". The book was adapted into a movie and a manga in 2004. Novala himself claims that \"There are no leaders within the Lolita world\". Mana is a guitarist and is known for popularizing of the Gothic Lolita fashion. He played in the band Malice Mizer (1999–2001) and founded an own band Moi Dix Mois (2002–present). These bands are categorized under the Visual Kei genre, known for their eccentric expressions and elaborate costumes. He founded his own fashion label, known as Moi-même-Moitié in 1999, which specializes in Gothic Lolita. They are both very interested in the Roccoco period.\n\nThe government of Japan has also tried to popularize Lolita fashion. The Minister of Foreign Affairs in February 2009, assigned models to spread Japanese pop culture. These people were given the title of Kawaa Taishi (ambassadors of cuteness). The first three ambassadors of cuteness were model Misako Aoki, who represents the Lolita style of frills-and-lace, Yu Kimura who represents the Harajuku style, and Shizuka Fujioka who represents the school-uniform-styled fashion. Another way that Japan tries to popularize Japanese street fashion and Lolita is by organizing the international Harajuku walk in Japan, this should caused that other foreign countries would organize a similar walk.\n\nPossible reasons for the popularity of Lolita fashion outside of Japan are a big growth in the interest of Japanese culture and use of the internet as a place to share information, leading to an increase in worldwide shopping, and the opportunity of enthusiastic foreign Lolitas to purchase fashion. The origin of the Japanese influences can be found in the late nineties, in which cultural goods such as Hello Kitty, Pokémon, and translated mangas appeared in the west. Anime was already being imported to the west in the early nineties, and scholars also mention that anime and manga caused the popularity of Japanese culture to rise. This is supported by the idea that cultural streams have been going from Japan to the west, and from the west to Japan.\n\nLolita is seen as a reaction against stifling Japanese society, in which young people are pressured to strictly adhere to gender roles and the expectations and responsibilities that are part of these roles. Wearing fashion inspired by childhood clothing is a reaction against this. This can be explained from two perspectives. Firstly, that it is a way to escape adulthood\nand to go back to the eternal beauty of childhood. Secondly, that it is an escape to a fantasy world, in which an ideal identity can be created that would not be acceptable in daily life.\n\nSome Lolitas say they enjoy the dress of the subculture simply because it is fun and not as a protest against traditional Japanese society. Other motives for lolita's could be that wearing the dress increases their self-confidence or to express an alternative identity.\n\nMuch of the very early lolitas in the 1990s hand-made most of their clothing, and were inspired by the Dolly Kei movement of the previous decade. Because of the diffusion of fashion magazines people were able to use lolita patterns to make their own clothing. Another way to own lolita was to buy it second-hand. The do-it-yourself behaviour can be seen more frequently by people who cannot afford the expensive brands.\n\nBecause more retails stores were selling lolita fashion the do-it-yourself behaviour became less important. Partly due to the rise of e-commerce and globalization it became possible to buy lolita clothing by Internet. The market was quickly divided into two main components: one which purchases mainly from Japanese or Chinese internet marketplaces, the other making use of shopping services to purchase Japanese brands, with some communities making larger orders as a group. Not every online shop delivers quality lolita (inspired) products, a notorious example is Milano (2014). with some web shops selling brand replicas, a frowned upon behaviour from many in this community. A Chinese replica manufacturer that is famous for his replica design is Oo Jia.\n\nMany lolitas considered being photographed without permission to be rude and disrespectful, however some rules differ or overlap in different parts of this community. Lolitas often host meetings in public spaces such as parks, restaurants, cafes, shopping malls, public events, and festivals. Some meetings take place at members' homes, and often have custom house rules (e.g. each member must bring their own cupcake to the meeting). Lolita meetings therefore are a social aspect of the lolita fashion community, serving as an opportunity for members to meet one another. Many lolitas also used to use Livejournal to communicate, but many have switched to Facebook groups in the interim.\n\nLolita fashion did not emerge until after the publication of the novel \"Lolita\" (1955), which was written by Vladimir Nabokov, the first translation of the novel in Japanese appearing in 1959. The novel is about a physical relationship between a twelve-year-old girl nicknamed Lolita, and a middle-aged man, Humbert Humbert. Because the book focused on the controversial subject of pedophilia and underage sexuality, lolita soon developed a negative connotation referring to a girl inappropriately sexualized at a very young age and associated with unacceptable sexual obsession.\n\n\"Lolita\" was made into a movie in 1962, which was sexualized and did not show the disinterest that Lolita had in sexuality. A remake was made in 1997. The 17 year old Amy Fisher, who attempted to murder the wife of her 35-year-old lover and whose crime was made into a film called \"The Amy Fisher Story\" (1993), was often called the Long Island Lolita. These mentioned media reinforced the sexual association Other racy connotations were created by Lolita Nylon advertisements (1964) and other media that used Lolita in sexual contexts. Another factor is that Western culture considers wearing cute clothing when adult to be childish, associating lolita with paedophile fantasies. In contrast, it is more acceptable for cuteness to be part of fashion in Japan.\n\nThe Lolita complex (also known as Lolicon) in writing about Lolita in sexual context. was a term used by Russel Trainer in his novel\" The Lolita Complex\" (1966) This term became popular within the otaku culture. and refers to paedophile desires. This expression of the Lolita complex can be found back in the nineties when school uniforms became a central object of desire and young girls were pictured as sexual in manga.\n\nWithin Japanese culture the name refers to cuteness and elegance rather than to sexual attractiveness.\n\nAnother confusion that often occurs is between the Lolita fashion style and cosplay. Although both spread from Japan, they are different and should be perceived as independent from each other; one is a fashion style while the other is role-play, with clothing and accessory being used to play a character. This does not exclude that there may be some overlap between members of both groups. This can be seen at anime conventions such as the convention in Götenborg in which cosplay and Japanese fashion is mixed. For some Lolitas, it is insulting if people label their outfit as a costume.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8763163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8763163", "title": "Medieval Christian views on Muhammad", "text": "Medieval Christian views on Muhammad\n\nDuring the Early Middle Ages, Christendom largely viewed Islam as a Christological heresy and Muhammad as a false prophet. By the Late Middle Ages, Islam was more typically grouped with heathenism, and Muhammad was viewed as inspired by the devil. A more relaxed or benign view of Islam only developed in the modern period, after the Islamic empires ceased to be an acute military threat to Europe. See Orientalism.\n\nThe earliest documented Christian knowledge of Muhammad stems from Byzantine sources, written shortly after Muhammad's death in 632. With the Crusades of the High Middle Ages, and the wars against the Ottoman Empire during the Late Middle Ages, the Christian reception of Muhammad became more polemical, moving from the classification as a heretic to depiction of Muhammad as a servant of Satan or as the Antichrist, who will be suffering tortures in Hell.\n\nIn contrast to the views of Muhammad in Islam, the Christian image stayed highly negative for over a millennium.\n\nThe earliest written Christian knowledge of Muhammad stems from Byzantine sources, written shortly after Muhammad's death in 632. In the anti-Jewish polemic the \"Teaching of Jacob\", a dialogue between a recent Christian convert and several Jews, one participant writes that his brother \"wrote to [him] saying that a deceiving prophet has appeared amidst the Saracens\". Another participant in the \"Doctrina\" replies about Muhammad: \"He is deceiving. For do prophets come with sword and chariot?, …[Y]ou will discover nothing true from the said prophet except human bloodshed\". Though Muhammad is never called by his name, there seems to have been knowledge of his existence. It also appears that both Jews and Christians viewed him in a negative light. Other contemporary sources, such as the writings of Sophronius of Jerusalem, show there was no knowledge of the Saracens having their own prophet or faith, and only remark that the Saracen attacks must be a punishment for Christian sins.\n\nKnowledge of Muhammad was available in Christendom from after the early expansion of his religion and, later, the translation of a polemical work by John of Damascus, who used the phrase \"false prophet in \"Heresies in Epitome: How They Began and Whence They Drew Their Origin.\". According to the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" Christian knowledge of Muhammad's life \"was nearly always used abusively\". Another influential source was the Epistolae Saraceni or the “Letters of a Saracen” written by an Oriental Christian and translated into Latin from Arabic. From the 9th century onwards, highly negative biographies of Muhammad were written in Latin, such as the one by Álvaro of Córdoba proclaiming him the Antichrist. Christendom also gained some knowledge of Muhammad through the Mozarabs of Spain, such as the 9th-century Eulogius of Córdoba, who was one of the Martyrs of Córdoba.\n\nIn the 11th century Petrus Alphonsi, a Jew who converted to Christianity, was another Mozarab source of information on Muhammad. Later during the 12th century Peter the Venerable, who saw Muhammad as the precursor to the Antichrist and the successor of Arius, ordered the translation of the Quran into Latin (\"Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete\") and the collection of information on Muhammad so that Islamic teachings could be refuted by Christian scholars.\n\nDuring the 13th century European biographers completed their work on the life of Muhammad in a series of works by scholars such as Peter Pascual, Riccoldo da Monte di Croce, and Ramon Llull in which Muhammad was depicted as an Antichrist while Islam was shown to be a Christian heresy. The fact that Muhammad was unlettered, that he married a wealthy widow, that in his later life he had several wives, that he was involved in several wars, and that he died like an ordinary person in contrast to the Christian belief in the supernatural end of Jesus' earthly life were all arguments used to discredit Muhammad.\n\nMedieval scholars and churchmen held that Islam was the work of Muhammad who in turn was inspired by Satan. Kenneth Setton wrote that Muhammad was frequently calumniated and made a subject of legends taught by preachers as fact. For example, in order to show that Muhammad was the anti-Christ, it was asserted that Muhammad died not in the year 632 but in the year 666 – the number of the beast – in another variation on the theme the number \"666\" was also used to represent the period of time Muslims would hold sway of the land. A verbal expression of Christian contempt for Islam was expressed in turning his name from Muhammad to Mahound, the \"devil incarnate\". Others usually confirmed to pious Christians that Muhammad had come to a bad end. According to one version after falling into a drunken stupor he had been eaten by a herd of swine, and this was ascribed as the reason why Muslims proscribed consumption of alcohol and pork. In another account of the alcohol ban, Muhammad learns about the Bible from a Jew and a heretical Arian monk. Muhammad and the monk get drunk and fall asleep. The Jew kills the monk with Muhammad's sword. He then blames Muhammad, who, believing he has committed the crime in a drunken rage, bans alcohol.\n\n\"Leggenda di Maometto\" is another example of such a story. In this version, as a child Muhammad was taught the black arts by a heretical Christian villain who escaped imprisonment by the Christian Church by fleeing to the Arabian Peninsula; as an adult he set up a false religion by selectively choosing and perverting texts from the Bible to create Islam. It also ascribed the Muslim holiday of Friday \"dies Veneris\" (day of Venus), as against the Jewish (Saturday) and the Christian (Sunday), to his followers' depravity as reflected in their multiplicity of wives. A highly negative depiction of Muhammad as a heretic, false prophet, renegade cardinal or founder of a violent religion also found its way into many other works of European literature, such as the chansons de geste, William Langland's \"Piers Plowman\", and John Lydgate's \"The Fall of the Princes\".\nThe thirteenth century \"Golden Legend\", a best-seller in its day containing a collection of hagiographies, describes \"Magumeth (Mahomet, Muhammad)\" as \"a false prophet and sorcerer\", detailing his early life and travels as a merchant through his marriage to the widow, Khadija and goes on to suggest his \"visions\" came as a result of epileptic seizures and the interventions of a renegade Nestorian monk named Sergius.\n\nIn Dante Alighieri's \"Divine Comedy\", Muhammad is in the ninth ditch of Malebolge, the eighth realm, designed for those who have caused schism; specifically, he was placed among the Sowers of Religious Discord. Muhammad is portrayed as split in half, with his entrails hanging out, representing his status as a heresiarch (Canto 28):\nThis scene is frequently shown in illustrations of the \"Divine Comedy\". Muhammad is represented in a 15th-century fresco \"Last Judgment\" by Giovanni da Modena and drawing on Dante, in the San Petronio Basilica in Bologna, as well as in artwork by Salvador Dalí, Auguste Rodin, William Blake, and Gustave Doré.\n\nOne common allegation laid against Muhammad was that he was an impostor who, in order to satisfy his ambition and his lust, propagated religious teachings that he knew to be false. Cultural critic and author Edward Said wrote in \"Orientalism\" regarding Dante's depiction of Muhammad:\n\nA more positive interpretation appears in the 13th-century \"Estoire del Saint Grail\", the first book in the vast Matter of Britain, the Lancelot-Grail. In describing the travels of Joseph of Arimathea, keeper of the Holy Grail, the author says that most residents of the Middle East were pagans until the coming of Muhammad, who is shown as a true prophet sent by God to bring Christianity to the region. This mission however failed when Muhammad's pride caused him to alter God's wishes, thereby deceiving his followers. Nevertheless, Muhammad's religion is portrayed as being greatly superior to paganism.\n\nThe depiction of Islam in the \"Travels of Sir John Mandeville\" is also relatively positive, though with many inaccurate and mythical features. It is said that Muslims are easily converted to Christianity because their beliefs are already so similar in many ways, and that they believe that only the Christian revelation will last until the end of the world. The moral behaviour of Muslims at the time is shown as superior to that of Christians, and as a standing reproach to Christian society.\n\nDepictions of Muhammad in the form of picaresque novel began to appear from the 13th century onward, such as in Alexandre du Pont's \"Roman de Mahom\", the translation of the Mi'raj, the \"Escala de Mahoma\" (“The Ladder of Muhammad”) by the court physician of Alfonso X of Castile and León and his son.\n\nMedieval European literature often referred to Muslims as \"infidels\" or \"pagans\", in sobriquets such as the \"paynim foe\". These depictions such as those in \"The Song of Roland\" represent Muslims worshiping Muhammad (spelt e.g. 'Mahom' and 'Mahumet') as a god, and depict them worshiping various deities in the form of \"idols\", ranging from Apollyon to Lucifer, but ascribing to them a chief deity known as \"Termagant\".\n\nConversely, in medieval romances such as the French Arthurian cycle, pagans such as the ancient Britons or the inhabitants of \"Sarras\" before the conversion of King Evelake, who presumably lived well before the birth of Muhammad, are often described as worshipping the same array of gods and as identical to the imagined (Termagant-worshipping) Muslims in every respect. In the same vein, the definition of \"Saracen\" in Raymond of Penyafort's \"Summa de Poenitentia\" starts by describing the Muslims but ends by including every person who is neither a Christian nor a Jew.\n\nWhen the Knights Templar were being tried for heresy reference was often made to their worship of a demon Baphomet, which was notable by implication for its similarity to the common rendition of Muhammad's name used by Christian writers of the time, Mahomet. All these and other variations on the theme were all set in the \"temper of the times\" of what was seen as a Muslim-Christian conflict as Medieval Europe was building a concept of \"the great enemy\" in the wake of the quickfire success of the early Muslim conquests shortly after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, as well as the lack of real information in the West of the mysterious East.\n\nMuhammad is characterized as \"pseudo-prophet\" in Byzantine and post-Byzantine religious and historic texts, as for example by Niketas Choniates (12th-13th c.).\n\n"}

The well-known photo, by AP photographer Nick Ut, shows her at nine years of age running naked on a road after being severely burned on her back by a South Vietnamese napalm attack.\n\nKim Phúc and her family were residents of the village of Trảng Bàng in South Vietnam. On June 8, 1972, South Vietnamese planes dropped a napalm bomb on Trảng Bàng, which had been attacked and occupied by North Vietnamese forces. Kim Phúc joined a group of civilians and South Vietnamese soldiers who were fleeing from the Caodai Temple to the safety of South Vietnamese-held positions. The Republic of Vietnam Air Force pilot mistook the group for enemy soldiers and diverted to attack. The bombing killed two of Kim Phúc's cousins and two other villagers. Kim Phúc received third degree burns after her clothing was burned by the fire. Associated Press photographer Nick Ut's photograph of Kim Phúc running naked amid other fleeing villagers, South Vietnamese soldiers and press photographers became one of the most haunting images of the Vietnam War. In an interview many years later, she recalled she was yelling, \"Nóng quá, nóng quá\" (\"too hot, too hot\") in the picture. \"The New York Times\" editors were at first hesitant to consider the photo for publication because of the nudity, but eventually approved it. A cropped version of the photo—with the press photographers to the right removed—was featured on the front page of \"The New York Times\" the next day. It later earned a Pulitzer Prize and was chosen as the World Press Photo of the Year for 1973.\n\nAfter snapping the photograph, Ut took Kim Phúc and the other injured children to Barsky Hospital in Saigon, where it was determined that her burns were so severe that she probably would not survive. After a 14-month hospital stay and 17 surgical procedures including skin transplantations, she was able to return home. A number of the early operations were performed by Finnish plastic surgeon Aarne Rintala (1926–2014).\nIt was only after treatment at a renowned special clinic in Ludwigshafen, West Germany, in 1982, that Kim Phúc was able to properly move again.\n\nUt continued to visit Kim Phúc until he was evacuated during the fall of Saigon, and they now speak almost weekly via telephone.\n\nAudio tapes of President Richard Nixon, in conversation with his chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman in 1972, reveal that Nixon mused \"I'm wondering if that was fixed\" after seeing the photograph. After the release of this tape, Ut commented, \"Even though it has become one of the most memorable images of the twentieth century, President Nixon once doubted the authenticity of my photograph when he saw it in the papers on 12 June 1972... The picture for me and unquestionably for many others could not have been more real. The photo was as authentic as the Vietnam War itself. The horror of the Vietnam War recorded by me did not have to be fixed. That terrified little girl is still alive today and has become an eloquent testimony to the authenticity of that photo. That moment thirty years ago will be one Kim Phúc and I will never forget. It has ultimately changed both our lives.\"\n\nLess publicized is film shot by British television cameraman Alan Downes for the British ITN news service and his Vietnamese counterpart Le Phuc Dinh who was working for the American television network NBC, which shows the events just before and after the photograph was taken (see image on right). In the top-left frame, a man stands and appears to take photographs as a passing airplane drops bombs. A group of children, Kim Phúc among them, run away in fear. After a few seconds, she encounters the reporters dressed in military fatigues, including Christopher Wain who gave her water (top-right frame) and poured some over her burns. As she turns sideways, the severity of the burns on her arm and back can be seen (bottom-left frame). A crying woman, Kim Phúc's grandmother, Tao, runs in the opposite direction holding her badly burned grandchild, three-year-old Danh, Kim Phúc's cousin, who died of his injuries (bottom-right frame). Sections of the film shot were included in \"Hearts and Minds\", the 1974 Academy Award-winning documentary about the Vietnam War directed by Peter Davis.\n\nPhúc was removed from her university as a young adult studying medicine and used as a propaganda symbol by the communist government of Vietnam. In 1986, however, she was granted permission to continue her studies in Cuba. Prime Minister of Vietnam Phạm Văn Đồng became her friend and patron. After arriving in Cuba, she met Bui Huy Toan, another Vietnamese student and her future fiancé. In 1992, Phúc and Toan married. On the way to their honeymoon in Moscow, they left the plane during a refuelling stop in Gander, Newfoundland, and asked for political asylum in Canada, which was granted. The couple now live in Ajax, Ontario, near Toronto, and have two children. In 1996, Phúc met the surgeons who had saved her life. The following year, she passed the Canadian Citizenship Test with a perfect score and became a Canadian citizen. In 2015, it was reported that she was receiving laser treatment at a hospital in Miami, Florida, to reduce the scarring on her left arm and back. The treatment is being provided free of charge.\n\nIn 1997 she established the first Kim Phúc Foundation in the U.S., with the aim of providing medical and psychological assistance to child victims of war. Later, other foundations were set up, with the same name, under an umbrella organization, Kim Phúc Foundation International.\n\nIn 2004, Phúc spoke at the University of Connecticut about her life and experience, learning how to be \"strong in the face of pain\" and how compassion and love helped her heal.\n\nOn December 28, 2009, National Public Radio broadcast her spoken essay, \"The Long Road to Forgiveness,\" for the \"This I Believe\" series. In May 2010, Phúc was reunited by the BBC with ITN correspondent Christopher Wain, who helped to save her life. On May 18, 2010, Phúc appeared on the BBC Radio 4 programme \"Its My Story\". In the programme, Phúc related how she was involved through her foundation in the efforts to secure medical treatment in Canada for Ali Abbas, who had lost both arms in a rocket attack on Baghdad during the invasion of Iraq in 2003.\n\nIn 1996, Kim Phúc gave a speech at the United States Vietnam Veterans Memorial on Veterans Day. In her speech, she said that one cannot change the past, but everyone can work together for a peaceful future. Rev. John Plummer, a Vietnam veteran, who believed he took part in coordinating the air strike with the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (though Plummer's entire chain of command and declassified documents indicate otherwise) met with Phúc briefly and was publicly forgiven. Plummer later admitted to \"The Baltimore Sun\" he had \"lied\", saying he was \"caught up in the emotion at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the day Phuc spoke\". Canadian filmmaker, Shelley Saywell, made a documentary about their meeting.\n\nOn November 10, 1994, Kim Phúc was named a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador. Her biography, \"The Girl in the Picture\", was written by Denise Chong and published in 1999. In 2003, Belgian composer Eric Geurts wrote \"The Girl in the Picture,\" dedicated to Kim Phúc. It was released on Flying Snowman Records, with all profits going to the Kim Phúc Foundation. On October 22, 2004, Kim Phúc was made a member of the Order of Ontario, and received an honorary Doctorate of Law from York University for her work to support child victims of war around the world. On October 27, 2005, she was awarded an honorary degree in Law from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. On June 2, 2011, she was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of Lethbridge. On May 19, 2016, she was awarded a Doctor of Civil Law, Honoris Causa by Saint Mary's University (Halifax).\n\n\"The Girl in the Picture: The Kim Phúc Story, the Photograph and the Vietnam War\" by Denise Chong is a 1999 biographical and historical work tracing the life story of Kim Phúc. Chong's historical coverage emphasizes the life, especially the school and family life, of Kim Phúc from before the attack, through convalescence, and into the present time.\n\n\"The Girl in the Picture\" deals primarily with Vietnamese and American relationships during the Vietnam War, while examining themes of war, racism, immigration, political turmoil, repression, poverty, and international relationships through the lens of family and particularly through the eyes and everyday lives of women. Kim Phúc and her mother, Nu, provide the lens through which readers of \"The Girl in the Picture\" experience war, strife, and the development of communism in Vietnam. Like Chong's first book, \"The Girl in the Picture\" was shortlisted for the Governor General's Literary Award for non fiction.\n\nIn a December 21, 2017, article for \"The Wall Street Journal\", Kim Phúc wrote that the trauma she suffered in the napalm strike still requires treatment, but that the psychological trauma was greater: \"But even worse than the physical pain was the emotional and spiritual pain.\" This led directly to her conversion to Christianity, which she credits with healing the psychological trauma of living over forty years being known to the world as \"Napalm Girl\". \"My faith in Jesus Christ is what has enabled me to forgive those who had wronged me,\" she wrote, \"no matter how severe those wrongs were.\"\n\n\n\n"}

A major work in Hasidic thought, it synthesizes the Hasidism of Pshischa and Kotzk in the style of Sochatchov, and is frequently cited in Torah \"shiurim\" (lectures) and articles to this day.\n\nBornsztain became known as the \"Shem Mishmuel\" after the title of this work, which was published posthumously.\n\nThe title comes from the Mishnah on \"Shabbat\" 12:3, which describes the prohibition against writing on Shabbat. The Mishnah teaches that if a Jew wishes to write a whole name like Shimon (שמעון) or Shmuel (שמואל), but writes only the first two letters of these names, \"shin\" (ש) and \"mem\" (מ), he still transgresses the prohibition—for \"shin\" and \"mem\" spell a shorter name, \"shem\" (שם) (which literally means \"name\"). Bornsztain's choice of the Mishnaic expression \"shem miShimon o miShmuel\" (\"Shem\" from Shimon or from Shmuel) for his title reflects the classical rabbinic play on words combining a rabbinic teaching with the author's own name.\n\nThe first eight volumes of \"Shem Mishmuel\" cover lessons on each of the \"parshiyot\" (weekly Torah readings). In traditional Hasidic style, they are not printed according to the sequence of the \"parshiyot\", but in the order in which the Rebbe delivered these lessons to his followers. The ninth volume deals exclusively with the Passover Haggadah.\n\nIn addition to displaying a thorough familiarity with Talmud, Midrash, Kabbalah, and other classic Jewish sources, Bornsztain presents many of the ideas of his father, Rabbi Avrohom Bornsztain, the first Sochatchover Rebbe, who was known as the \"Avnei Nezer\" after the title of his major work.\n\nThe volume on the Pesach Haggadah was published first by Bornsztain's son and successor, Rabbi Dovid Bornsztain, the third Sochatchover Rebbe, in Piotrków in 1927. Rabbi Dovid published the rest of the volumes between 1927 and 1932, with funding provided by Rabbi David Parshinowski. Bornsztain's other son, Rabbi Chanoch Henoch Bornsztain, who had immigrated to Israel in 1924 and became the fourth Sochatchover Rebbe after Rabbi David's death in the Warsaw Ghetto in 1942, published the second edition of \"Shem Mishmuel\" in Jerusalem in 1950 with the aid of Rabbi Avraham Parshan, son of Rabbi Parshinowski.\n\nRabbi Parshan also assisted with the publication of a third edition in 1965. The third edition of the volume dealing with the Hagaddah included an additional section containing \"chiddushei Torah\" (new Torah thoughts) on the Hagaddah which had been penned by Rabbi Dovid and which had survived the war, entitled \"Chasdei Dovid\". Other editions followed; the seventh, corrected edition used by Rabbi Zvi Belovski in his English translation for Targum Press was published in Israel in 1988 by the Parshan family trust in memory of Rabbi Parshan.\n\n"}

The theatre was the final design by the Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio and was not completed until after his death. The trompe-l'œil onstage scenery, designed by Vincenzo Scamozzi, to give the appearance of long streets receding to a distant horizon, was installed in 1585 for the very first performance held in the theatre, and is the oldest surviving stage set still in existence. The full Roman-style \"scaenae frons\" back screen across the stage is made from wood and stucco imitating marble. It was the home of the Accademia Olimpica, which was founded there in 1555.\n\nThe Teatro Olimpico is, along with the Teatro all'antica in Sabbioneta and the Teatro Farnese in Parma, one of only three Renaissance theatres remaining in existence. Both these theatres were based, in large measure, on the Teatro Olimpico. It is still used several times a year.\n\nSince 1994, the Teatro Olimpico, together with other Palladian buildings in and around Vicenza, has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto.\n\nThe Teatro Olimpico is the last work by Palladio, and ranks amongst his highest masterworks. The Vicentine architect had returned to his native city in 1579, bringing with him a lifetime of detailed study into all aspects of Roman architecture, and a more detailed understanding of the architecture of classical theatre than any other living person. Palladio had illustrated Daniele Barbaro's Italian translation of Vitruvius' \"De architectura\"; the prints for this edition include floorplans for Roman theatres and an elevation for the \"scaenae frons\" of Vicenza's ruined Roman theatre, the \"Teatro Berga\". As well, Palladio's papers include plans for the imagined reconstruction of the ruined Roman theatres in Pola and Verona.\n\nPalladio, a founder of the Olympic Academy (the \"Accademia Olimpica\", created in 1555), had already designed temporary theatre structures at various locations in the city. The most notable of these had been erected some seventeen years previously in the great hall of the Basilica Palladiana.\n\nIn 1579 the Academy obtained the rights to build a permanent theatre in an old fortress, the \"Castello del Territorio,\" which had been turned into a prison and powder magazine before falling into disuse. Palladio was asked to produce a design, and despite the awkward shape of the old fortress, he decided to use the space to recreate an academic reconstruction of the Roman theatres that he had so closely studied. In order to fit a stage and seating area into the wide, shallow space, it was necessary for Palladio to flatten the semicircular seating area of the Roman theatre into an ellipse.\n\nPalladio died in August 1580, only six months after construction had started on the theatre. Despite this setback, construction continued, with Palladio's sketches and drawings serving as a guide, and Palladio's son, Silla, taking charge of the project. Soon, the other prominent Vicentine architect, Vincenzo Scamozzi, was called upon to complete the project.\n\nScamozzi had already stepped in to complete Palladio's other great unfinished project, the villa just east of Vicenza that is today known as \"La Rotonda\". It is a mark of Scamozzi's genius that both these projects are today regarded as being among Palladio's most successfully executed works.\n\nScamozzi's contributions include the \"Odèo\" and \"Antiodèo\" rooms, as well as the entrance archway which leads from the street, through an old medieval wall into the courtyard of the old fortress.\n\nIn order to make the archway fit with its surroundings, and to prepare visitors to the theatre for the transformation from medieval to classical surroundings, Scamozzi built the archway to be the same size and shape as the \"porta reggia\" or triumphal arch at the center of the \"scaenae frons\" or rear wall of the stage. However, the entrance archway was rusticated to make it fit with the rough and well-worn wall into which it was being inserted.\n\nHowever, Scamozzi's most famous and most original contribution to the theatre was his elaborate stage set, with its remarkable trompe l'œil street views. He not only designed the sets, but also put considerable effort into designing the lighting that permitted the make-believe houses of the stage scenery to be lit from within, completing the illusion that these were real streets.\n\nAside from a single sketch of the \"scaenae frons\", Palladio left no plans as to what kind of scenery should be used onstage. His illustration of an idealized Roman scaenae frons for Barbaro's edition of Vitruvius had shown perspective street views similar to those which would later be built in the Teatro Olimpico. But the sketch of the proposed scaenae frons for the Teatro Olimpico shows no such street scenes; the space behind the central archway and the doors to each side is blank.\n\nThe simplest explanation for the absence of any street scenes in this drawing is that the Academy had not yet obtained the land on which the scenery would later be built. This land was acquired in 1582, after Scamozzi had taken charge of the project. This made it possible to extend the building (including a special apse-shaped projection to accommodate the longest and most elaborate of the seven street views). The Academy's petition to the city government for the additional land anticipated that if acquired, the space would be used to create perspective scenery; it explains that the extra land would be used to build a theatre \"along the lines laid out by our colleague Palladio, who has designed it to permit perspective views.\"\n\nTherefore, Palladio can be given credit for having inspired the remarkable perspectives which are visible to the audience through the central archway of the scaenae frons (also known as the \"porta reggia\") and also through the smaller side openings. But it is also appropriate to regard Scamozzi as the technical genius behind their remarkably successful execution.\n\nScamozzi's stage set was the first practical introduction of perspective views into Renaissance theatre. The scenery consists of seven hallways decorated to create the illusion of looking down the streets of a city from classical antiquity. Ancient Thebes, was to be the setting for the first play staged in the theatre. A set of seven extraordinarily realistic \"trompe-l'œil\" false perspectives provide the illusion of long street views, while actually the sets recede only a few meters. The way in which seats in all parts of the theatre were provided with at least one perspective view can be seen by observing the theatre floorplan and following the sight lines of audience members in different parts of the theatre.\n\nThe theatre was inaugurated on March 3, 1585, with a production of Sophocles' \"Oedipus Rex\". However, the theatre was virtually abandoned after only a few productions. The scenes, which had been created in wood and stucco for \"Oedipus Rex\", and which were meant to represent the streets of Thebes, were never removed: despite bombings and other vicissitudes, they have miraculously preserved into modern times. The original lighting system of glass oil lamps, designed by Scamozzi, heightened the illusion of space, has been used only a few times because of the high cost and the risk of fire. Scamozzi's lighting system was used when, in 1997, the theatre was again employed for a production of \"Oedipus Rex\".\n\nThe Teatro Olimpico is still used for plays and musical performances, but audience sizes are limited to 400, for conservation reasons. Performances take place in two theatre seasonsclassical plays in the autumn and the festival \"Il Suono dell'Olimpico\" in the spring. It is not equipped with heating or air conditioning, which could damage the delicate wooden structures.\n\nThe Theatre has been used as a filming location for films such as \"Don Giovanni\" (1979) and \"Casanova\" (2005).\n\nSome authors have incorrectly stated that when the Teatro Olimpico was constructed in 1580-1585, it was the first purpose-built theatre in Europe in over a thousand years. In reality, the theatre was one of a number of new permanent theatres being constructed at the time. Records show that permanent theatres were constructed in Ferrara (1531), Rome (1545), Mantua (1549), Bologna (1550), Siena (1561), and Venice (1565). This last theatre was designed by Palladio himself, for the Compagnia della Calza.\n\nOver the centuries, the Teatro Olimpico has had many admirers, but relatively few imitators. One critic has observed, \"In the history of theatre design, the Teatro Olimpico was a temporary hiatus, for succeeding generations adopted the proscenium arch and painterly stage sets. Palladio's ideas are closer to the spirit of the modern theatre, which favors the relationship of audience to action.\" Another notes, \"The rigid form of the scenic arrangements of the Teatro Olimpico...precluded any further development,\" and that the theatre was, in a sense, a prisoner of its creators' emphasis on \"considerations of archaeology\" and truthfulness to the Roman model. The successful completion of Palladio's experiment in reconstructing the ancient model meant that there was no longer any need to pursue the objective of recovering the Roman past; it was now possible to start making innovations, starting with eliminating the rigid and unchangeable scaenae frons and the unchanging perspective views.\n\nThe first theatre to draw inspiration from the Teatro Olimpico, and the one in which its influence is the most obvious, is the Teatro all'antica in Sabbioneta. This theatre, which was designed by Vincenzo Scamozzi, is sometimes also referred to, somewhat confusingly, as the \"Teatro Olimpico\", and some of its design elements, including most notably the colonnade behind the seating area and the self-conscious references to ancient Rome, are clearly drawn from the original Teatro Olimpico. However, the elaborate scaenae frons is absent in Sabbioneta, and only a single perspective view, along a single street, is employed onstage. As well, the seating area departs radically from Palladio's elliptical plan (perhaps as a result of the much narrower shape of the building in which the theatre is housed).\n\nThe English architect Inigo Jones visited the Teatro Olimpico shortly after its completion, and took careful notes, in which he expressed particular admiration for the perspective views: \"[T]he chief artifice was that whear so ever you sat you saw one of thes Prospects...\"\n\n"}

After Zuckerberg and Saverin settled their lawsuit, Saverin broke off contact with the author.\n\nBen Mezrich maintains that the book is not a work of fiction despite his narrative style of writing. Some of his sources are his conversations with Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin and the court documents made available to him because of \"all these college kids suing each other.\"\n\nThe story begins in the weeks that precede the launch of \"thefacebook.com\" at Harvard. Eduardo Saverin, cast as the protagonist, has befriended Mark Zuckerberg, and both struggle for social acceptance—Saverin by joining a final club, Zuckerberg by creating a website where girls can be ranked according to their looks. Zuckerberg's stunt, though successful, puts him at odds with the Harvard Administrative Board, and has angered numerous campus women's groups as well as individual female students. An article on the incident in the Harvard Crimson is noticed by three Harvard seniors: twin brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and Divya Narendra, all of whom who are trying to launch a Harvard dating site. The trio approaches Zuckerberg, convincing him to join in the venture. Zuckerberg, however, feels their site does not have what he thinks is the right approach and begins developing thefacebook with financial help from Saverin and programming from Zuckerberg's roommates.\n\nOnce thefacebook.com is launched it becomes an immediate hit on campus. After discovering what Zuckerberg has done, the Winklevoss' and Narendra are infuriated and seek legal advice from their father's lawyer. The story then chronicles the changing relationship between Saverin and Zuckerberg, who have different visions for thefacebook.\n\nWhile the first half of the book centers on the Harvard University campus and focuses on college life, the second half centers on the business end of thefacebook and Zuckerberg's move to Silicon Valley. Napster creator Sean Parker inserts himself into Zuckerberg's life, soon becoming a mentor to Zuckerberg who guides him to Silicon Valley venture capitalists and other players in the industry. Saverin, having graduated from Harvard, continues to feel sidelined by Parker, who he feels is not the best influence on Zuckerberg and is replacing him in importance to the advancement of thefacebook.\n\nThe end of the book does not provide a conclusion since, according to the author's admission, matters of dispute are ongoing in the court of law.\n\nColumbia Pictures released a film adaptation of the book in 2010 titled \"The Social Network\". Directed by David Fincher with the screenplay written by Aaron Sorkin, the film stars Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Armie Hammer, and Justin Timberlake.

{"id": "41931657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41931657", "title": "Tito Canepa", "text": "Tito Canepa\n\nTito Enrique Canepa Jiménez (21 September 1916 - 11 February 2014) was a leading Dominican painter of the generation that came of age in the 1930s and 1940s. Canepa's artistic identity was shaped in New York City, where he lived from the age of 21, never returning to stay in his native country. Despite this distance, or perhaps because of it, as León David has pointed out, his works always evince a certain \"dominicanidad\" without his setting out to achieve it as a goal — a \"dominicanidad\" that is never folkloric. Of the three modernist Dominican painters of the 1930s and 40s — Canepa, Colson and Suro — singled out by Rafael Díaz Niese in 1944 as most significant, Canepa is the one whose artistic activity developed in the most continuous absence from his native country, and the one longest resident in New York. Cánepa is accented in Spanish but not in the original Ligurian.\n\nCanepa was born in 1916 in San Pedro de Macorís in the Dominican Republic. His initial artistic studies were in his native country. After participating in the political movement against the Trujillo dictatorship his existence in the Dominican Republic became precarious, and he left for New York in 1935, settling there permanently in 1937 when he accepted a position in the New York Siqueiros workshop on 13th Street. There he worked under Roberto Berdecio on a number of murals, while attending class at the Art Students League. Exile intensified his childhood memories, which were colored by his maternal family's progressive republican and anti-colonial traditions. Two of his maternal ancestors had been presidents of the Dominican Republic: Manuel Jimenes (presidency 1848-1849), a product of the Enlightenment and abolitionism, and Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra (presidency 1902-1916). In addition, Canepa's art reflected his paternal Genovese family's seafaring history and his father's extravagant construction of a small opera theater in San Pedro de Macorís, the Teatro Colón. It was there, watching the Spanish painter Enrique Tarazona at work, that Canepa gained \"the sweeping confidence and bold absorption of historical styles that characterizes much\" of his painting, \"absorbing his catechism of old masters at such an early age that it became a digested part of his work.\"\n\nIn New York he was steeped in the artistic and social ferment of the WPA period. He exhibited in the Bonestell and ACA galleries, and his early circle of friends, with whom he exchanged paintings and drawings, included the painters David Burliuk, Pavel Tchelitchew, Walter Houmère, Rufino Tamayo and Mario Carreño and (later) Edward Laning. Far from setting out to become a 'Dominican' painter, he felt himself to be part of a broader tradition. Here a key influence was his mentor, the Dominican art historian and musicologist Américo Lugo Romero. With Lugo he spent almost every day of the better part of a year in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, absorbing his mentor's working connoisseurship of Renaissance art as the two discussed and challenged attributions of paintings.\n\nHis earliest recognition in the Dominican Republic came from Rafael Díaz Niese, on the occasion of a show of self-portraits in 1943 at the Galería Nacional de Bellas Artes in Santo Domingo. Díaz Niese's essay established Canepa, Darío Suro and Jaime Colson as the trinity of Dominican artists who led the second generation of high modernism (1930s and 1940s). Of Canepa's now lost 1943 self-portrait, Díaz Niese wrote: \n\nRegarding other early works and against the background Canepa's familiarity with Renaissance art, Díaz Niese summed up the outstanding qualities of his paintings:\n\nIn his early works, according to Edward Sullivan, \"the figures are solidly constructed in an almost sculptural fashion. They exist in a seemingly timeless realm\"; in works of the 1970s he seems to be paying homage to Mantegna, Piero and other Quattrocento artists who \"demonstrated such interest in the cool, calm and quasi-mathematical measuring of space. Many of these compositions are highly expansive and suggest the ambitious spatial descriptions of mural paintings.\"\n\nDream symbolism, the \"nostalgic search for a vanished land\" and the exploration of the \"mysterious realm of family and childhood\" are among the themes that León David identified in Canepa's work.\n\nDuring the Second World War Canepa served in the US Army's Signal Corps making propaganda films. In 1944 he married the modern dancer Florence Lessing.\n\nIn the 1950s, from New York, he was centrally involved in the group of political leaders planning to bring down the dictator of the Dominican Republic Trujillo.\n\nIn the 1970s his work was the object of a series of articles in Dominican newspapers, notably those by María Ugarte, a leading expert on the country's cultural and artistic heritage, in \"El Caribe\", and by poet and art critic León David, in \"El Síglo\". This renewed interest was largely triggered by one event: the efforts of a member of the Trujillo family to seize his historical triptych \"Enriquillo – Duarte – Luperón\" (1971) while still in the Santo Domingo airport. The new appreciation culminated in the publication in 1988 of León David's monograph.\n\nIn the 1980s Canepa together with several other Dominican artists, including Bismarck Victoria, Freddy Rodríguez and Magno Laracuente formed the Dominican Visual Artists of New York (DVANY), which organized several important exhibitions.\n\nIn 1992 he was the recipient of a lifetime achievement award from the Fundación Ciencia y Arte of the Dominican Republic, with \"the eternal gratitude of the Dominican people for [his] pictorial oeuvre.\"\n\nIn the 1990s, Canepa exhibited his work in a number of shows, including a show of Latin American art at the Mexican Cultural Institute in Washington DC and the Step Gallery in New York. In 1996 his by now famous triptych \"Enriquillo - Duarte - Luperón\" was chosen as the cover illustration for the most important group show of Dominican art ever to have been mounted outside the country: \"Modern and Contemporary Art from the Dominican Republic\" co-organised by the Spanish Institute and Americas Society, New York, in which his works occupied a significant place. The exhibition also travelled to the Bass Museum of Art, Miami Beach.\n\nIn 2005, the CUNY Dominican Studies Institute inaugurated their archives with an extensive collection of Tito Canepa's letters, drawings and photographs, along with three paintings: \"Ojeda y Caonabo\" (1984), \"The Sisters Mirabál\" (1985) and \"The Gulf of Arrows\" (1987).\n\nIn 2008 the Fundación Global Democracia y Desarollo (Global Foundation for Democracy and Development) and the CUNY Dominican Studies Institute organized a show at the Galería de Arte FUNGLODE in Santo Domingo, \"Tito Cánepa – 60 Years of Asserting Dominican Art in the United States\".\n\nIn 2008 the Second International and Interdisciplinary Conference on Dominican Studies \"Dominicans in the U.S. Prior to 1970 - Recovering an Earlier Dominican Presence. Dedicated to Camila Henríquez Ureña and Tito Cánepa\" was held at Hostos Community College in New York City.\n\nIn February/March 2013 the CUNY Dominican Studies Institute presented an exhibit \"El Músico y el Pintor/ The Musician and the Painter: Petitón Guzmán and Tito Enrique Cánepa — An Exhibit Documenting the Lifetime, Work, and Artistic Trajectory of Two Early Twentieth Century Dominican Artists in New York\".\n\n"}

Trego\n\nWilliam Brooke Thomas Trego (15 September, 1858 – 24 June, 1909) was an American painter best known for his historical military subjects, in particular scenes of the American Revolution and Civil War.\n\nWilliam B. T. Trego was born in Yardley, Bucks County, Pennsylvania in 1858, the son of the artist Jonathan Kirkbridge Trego and Emily Roberts née Thomas. At the age of two William's hands and feet became nearly paralyzed, either from polio, or from a doctor administering a dose of calomel (mercurous chloride). Trego's family moved to Detroit in 1874 where William was enrolled in the local school, but an incident where 16-year-old William burned off all his hair with a gas jet made his father decide to teach William in his studio from then on. Despite his crippled hands, young William showed an aptitude for art, learning to paint with a brush jammed in his right hand while he guided it with his left. William Trego first received public attention when he exhibited a painting titled \"The Charge of Custer at Winchester\" in 1879 at the Michigan State Fair. His depiction of George Armstrong Custer's charge at the Third Battle of Winchester was described by the \"Cleveland Press\" as \"one of the best historical paintings of the kind that has ever been produced by an American artist.\"\n\nLater that year, Trego used the proceeds from the sale of \"The Charge of Custer at Winchester\" to enroll himself at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He studied at PAFA for three years under Thomas Eakins, in courses that included instruction on aspects of the human figure, including anatomical study of the human and animal body and surgical dissection. Trego did not appreciate Eakins' rigorous, terse teaching style, and would later remark:\n\nIn an 1882 Academy exhibition, Trego won the first Toppan Prize for his work, \"Battery of Light Artillery en Route,\" and the painting was subsequently purchased for the Academy by Fairman Rogers. In 1883, Trego received what he thought was a snub from the Academy when the art jury for the Temple Competition of Historical Paintings, a competition intended to help revive historical painting by limiting entries to depictions of the American War of Independence\", decided there were no paintings of sufficient quality to merit a 1st or second place, and awarded Trego 3rd place for his painting of George Washington and his troops called \"The March to Valley Forge\". Trego sued the Academy on the grounds that if his painting was the best overall, it should receive first place (and he should get the $3,000 prize money). In 1886, he lost the case, with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling the jury was well within their rights under the contract of the exhibit to award prizes as they saw fit.\n\nAfter leaving the Academy, Trego lived in North Wales, Pennsylvania, with his mother and father. Except for trips abroad, Trego would live in North Wales for the rest of his life, working in a studio behind his house. He used the town residents, their horses, and the surrounding landscape as models and backdrops for his paintings. Trego was becoming well known for the accuracy of his military depictions as well as the honest, sometimes brutal realism, especially in his Civil War subjects The Civil War works were well received and Trego had much success selling paintings during that time.\n\nIn 1887, he went to Paris to study at the Académie Julian under the French academic painters Tony Robert-Fleury and William-Adolphe Bouguereau. Trego studied at the French museums while he was there and enjoyed the Paris night life with other Pennsylvania Academy alumni such as Robert Henri, Augustus B. Koopman, Henry McCarter, and Frederick J. Waugh. Trego also participated in the Paris Salons of 1889 and 1890, gaining some recognition for his 1889 submission, a military painting titled \"The End of the Charge of von Bredow’s Brigade at Rezonville\" depicting German cavalry units charge against French during the Franco-Prussian War. One French writer thought this work put Trego on par with the famous French academic military artist, Édouard Detaille. On his ocean voyage home from Paris in 1890, Trego returned to America not only with new found knowledge of French academic painting, he also returned with a French fiancée. But in a sad and very public event on board ship, the \"handsome French girl\" (as reported in the newspapers of the time) switched her affections to fellow Académie Julian student James R. Fisher. When they arrived in Philadelphia the news papers reported the two artists as parting \"bitter enemies\".\n\nAfter his return to the States, Trego's work received much acclaim from critics. In 1891, noted American art collector Thomas Benedict Clarke wrote of Trego:\n\nDespite these accolades and the prestige of exhibiting in the Paris Salon, Trego found it hard to sell paintings due to the declining in popularity of realistic military artwork. He painted portraits and genre paintings to make money and took on work doing book and magazine illustration. He also tried unsuccessfully to become an instructor at The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. He lived with, and was supported by, his parents during the 1890s. Trego's father died in 1901 and his stepmother died six years later. Trego's increasing financial problems during this time made him take on students including Walter Emerson Baum and his wife, Flora. Trego tried to revive his career by basing a painting on the popular novel \"\" with one of his last works, \"The Chariot Race from Ben Hur\" (1908). He sent it to the 1909 National Academy of Design exhibition in New York but it failed to spark any interest. William Trego was found unconscious in his studio on June 24, 1909 and was dead by the time the doctor arrived. His obituary in \"The New York Times\" reported that he died of \"overexertion\" due to \"excessive heat\". His death has been characterized as a suicide by gunshot or poison. but the cause of death specified on his death certificate was stated as poison. The contents of his North Wales studio were left to Walter Emerson Baum.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Trego had painted over 200 historical and military paintings. These would become so widely published after his death that writer Edwin Augustus Peeples commented: \nIn 1976, Trego's \"The March to Valley Forge\" had become such an iconic image of that event that it was reproduced as a souvenir postage sheet issued by the United States Postal Service as part of the observance of the United States Bicentennial. It is currently on loan from the Museum of the American Revolution to Valley Forge National Historical Park.\n\nA book was published about Trego's life, So Bravely and So Well: The Life and Art of William T. Trego, by Joseph P. Eckhardt, in 2011.\n\nTrego's work is represented in many permanent collections including:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 2004, the Museum of Biblical Art sponsored the traveling exhibition, Threads of Faith: Recent Works from the Women of Color Quilters Network. \n\n\nSince the founding of the WCQN, other national organizations formed to foster growth among African American quilters have been founded:\n\n\n\n"}
