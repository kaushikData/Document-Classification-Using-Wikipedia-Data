K. Asante, Jr. and released in 2005. It has won five international film festival awards in the category of Best Documentary (including) UNESCO \"Breaking the Chains Award\"). Other awards it has won include \"Best Documentary at the Pan African (Los Angeles) and Bridgetown (Barbados) Film Festivals; Best Film at the International Black Cinema (Berlin) Film Festival; and Best International Documentary at the Harlem (New York) International Film Festival\".\n\n\"500 Years Later\" has received praise as well as controversy, both for the genre of the film (creative documentary), and its social-political impact with relation to race study. The film opened on February 28, 2005, at the Pan-African Awards (PAFF) and won Best Documentary at its premiere. It made its American television premiere on August 23, 2008, on TV One (Radio One), and Ethiopian Television premiere on October 27, 2007. It was shown nationally in South Africa on December 14, 2014, on SABC 2. In 2010, the sequel, \"Motherland\", was released.\n\n\"500 Years Later\" studies the African diaspora and the impact of slavery throughout history, identifying key issues facing the world's black communities, including poor education, poverty, crime, and the way that such issues dehumanize and degrade black peoples. The film also gives insight into the struggles faced by continental Africans today, for instance in terms of poverty, disease, and corrupt governments. While the continuing negative impact, influence and effects of the trans-Atlantic slave trade are highlighted, scholars interviewed for the film express hope that \"old scars can be healed\" and Africans as a race will advance through education about their history.\n\nThe film states that the lasting effects of slavery are still felt 500 years later, hence the title. This is justified and explained through a series of scholarly interviews throughout the film. The film begins with an adage that illustrates its historical theme: \"Until lions tell their story, the tale of the hunt will always glorify the hunter.\"\n\nThe promotional page for the producer of the film describes it thusly: \"\"500 Years Later\" is a compelling journey, infused with the spirit and music of liberation, that chronicles the struggle of a people from enslavement who continue to fight for the most essential human right - freedom.\" The film presents the richness of African cultures and traditions and how they have evolved since slavery was abolished, emphasizing that prior to the beginning of the Atlantic Slave Trade Africans were free. The film includes testimonies, voices, and opinions gathered around five continents. Many of the people who voice their opinion are scholars or experts on the African diaspora. Those interviewed in the film criticize contemporary rap music as being particularly negative for Africans and their descendants, as they believe it reinforced racist stereotypes that were established in part because of the slave trade.\n\nA lasting example of the stereotypes referenced in the film is a study performed by Kenneth and Mamie Clark in which black children were given a variety of dolls, including black and white ones, and were told to pick the \"smarter\" or \"better\" one. A majority of the black children chose the white dolls. Many of those interviewed believe that a distinct change to the educational system is necessary to change the mindset of people of African descent. The film affirms that \"the kind of education that we have is to still enslave our minds, to make us believe we are inferior.\" Education should be the main weapon for the new generations of Africans and African descendants, to remind the world of the richness and struggle of African history.\n\nAt the end of the film, Africans are encouraged to remember their past, in order to move forward. The film promotes the idea that making it through enslavement should be a strength, not a weakness or something to be ashamed about; that the people who enslaved the Africans should be the ones that are ashamed. Essentially, the goal proposed is to teach African children a more Afrocentric history, instead of a Eurocentric one. It further argues that teaching African-descent people about a history that is not their own will not help because they cannot relate to it. It also indicates that society must establish and promote African ideas and history in order to preserve what they want for future generations. The film calls for the ideas promoted within it to become mainstream so that there can be a better Africa and a better history associated with the continent.\n\nThe cast features key figures from the African-American academic world.\n\n\n\"500 Years Later\" was the first film to win a UNESCO award for documenting slavery. And was part of UNESCO slave route project started in 1994: \"The prize awarded $10,000 to a film that breaks the silence and speaks to the social, historical, economic and psychological impact of the slave trade; a film that raises public awareness of slavery’s historical and contemporary manifestations; a film that gives voice to the dispossessed, reflects their perspectives and articulates their\nresistance to this dehumanization.\" UNESCO launched the Slave Route Project in 1994. This project wants to increase knowledge and understanding in terms of slavery and historical events related to it. \n\nKingsley Sheteh, from A Neo-Copernican Review, asserts that the film \"500 Years Later\" is a step in the right direction in depicting the relationship between the Western world and Africa, showcasing the historically dependent and underdeveloped status of African countries. Shetah also pointed out that, although the movie did a great job in touching on sensitive issue that are causes for Africa's problems, it is worth mentioning it failed to treat the issue of conflict. Shetah cites reasons that independent African state governments are heavily corrupted due to problems that can't be simply be tied down to ideology, slavery, and colonialism. While not exactly presenting overly new information, the documentary's delivery of the material and evidence is refreshing, meant to promote discussion among groups of people.\n\n\"500 Years Later\" holds a 6.8/10 rating on IMDb.com from over 150 users. It also holds an audience approval rating of 88% on rotten tomatoes from over 340 voters, and has an average rating of 4.2 out of 5.\nMany critics received the film as a way to explore African history like never before. The film is a compilation of interviews that offer history from the perspective of people whose knowledge has been suppressed for years. \"500 Years Later\" is applauded for its vast focus on African history, both the good and the bad.\n\nDespite much success, \"500 Years Later\" received mixed reviews from critics regarding content and presentation. Dan Schindel, a documentary reviewer, calls the film \"The Malcolm X to the MLK of the average doc that covers African-related material\" and offers many examples of the extremity of the film. An article entitled \"Destroying the Horrors of 500 Years\" on the African Holocaust website, written by Attahiru Kawu-Bala in 2006, praised the film as an \"articulate multi-dimensional African world perspective\" with regard to the effects of African Diaspora. Kawu-Bala argued that the techniques used in the documentary did not rely on emotion and instead used facts and truth to build a case from an African standpoint. By contrast, Curt Holman recognized the film's righteousness, but believed \"a more informative film would have been more effective.\" He found the video to be emotionally charged and, at times, overly obvious. According to Holman, the emotional biases sometimes overshadowed the factual content.\n\nWanuri Kahiu, a Kenyan film director, states that the film is a discussion between the \"greatest and most articulate thinkers of the African global nation.\" In his review of \"500 Years Later\", Kahiu wrote that the documentary should not be referred to as a film but rather an \"audiovisual reference book\" because of how informative the documentary is. According to Kahiu, \"500 Years Later\" is a good resource to show the challenges people of African descent faced during the Diaspora and slavery and the challenges they still face today. He further states that the film is a great representation of the strength of African-American culture and citizenry, and claims that the movie is a call for African people to patiently work to rid the African world of the \"defeatist nature\" still subconsciously ingrained in them today.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7342407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7342407", "title": "Ascent of the Blessed", "text": "Ascent of the Blessed\n\nAscent of the Blessed is a Hieronymus Bosch painting made between 1505 and 1515. It is in the Gallerie dell'Accademia, in Venice, Italy.\n\nThis painting is part of a polyptych of four panels entitled \"Visions of the Hereafter\". The others are \"Terrestrial Paradise\", \"Fall of the Damned into Hell\" and \"Hell\".\n\nThe most intriguing element of this painting is the large tunnel at the top of the panel. It appears from the perspective of looking through a straw and into the heavenly beyond. As Stephen Hitchens writes, it could also be described as a “funnel of goodness and light [as] a source of variety and surprise capturing the visionary and ecstatic union with God.” The three dimensional tunnel gives the viewer a peek of the “white light” from Heaven with three figures waiting at the end for the blessed. The near side of the tunnel has one angel carrying a human soul towards the pearly gates. The viewer can differentiate the two figures because one has a white robe with wings and the other is naked, thus a soul and an angel. Both have their hands in prayer formation.\n\nRight beneath the tunnel, there is an array of angels helping blessed human souls towards salvation. In the lower parts of the panel there are two angels per one soul, suggesting that some humans need more help than others. As it gets closer to the top of the panel, there is a one to one ratio of angel and soul. This might symbolize that the human souls that are pulled from Earth’s gravity and towards the tunnel become lighter in weight. The angels have their hands either on the human body carrying it upwards or near the body simply guiding it where to go. All the figures in the painting are looking upwards towards the tunnel.\n\nAll the characters have similar facial features because the physical aspect of the humans and angels are more idealized and not individualized. The figures are not meant to look like specific individual people. The style of the hair is also quite idealized; the angels have long wavy hair and the souls have short hair. None of the human souls have organs to help differentiate whether they are male or female. This could be a form of symbolism which shows that there are no genders in Heaven. This could be implying that all human souls are no longer differentiated by sexual organs and everyone is the same. The angels have a multitude of different colored robes and wings, such as subtle reds, blues, and greens.\n\nThe painting as a whole is very dimly lit which contrasts with the white brightness at the end of the tunnel. The light at the end of the tunnel is not the light that lights up the bottom of the painting, which is most likely the earthly realm. The extreme darkness directly around the tunnel indicates that the heavenly light has nothing to do with the light coming from below. The areas outside the tunnel are dark and gray. The light actually becomes darker as it moves upwards then when it reaches the tunnel there is a sudden eruption of light. Coincidentally, this painting of the funnel has been known to look very similar to people who have had near-death experiences. During the fifteenth-century, the entrance to paradise was depicted as a funnel which appeared in many miniatures. The shape of the radiant funnel actually has some resemblance to contemporary zodiac diagrams but Bosch transforms it into a shining corridor through which the blessed approach God.\n\nBosch’s paintings reflect the religious themes that dominated art and society in the Netherlands during the sixteenth century, especially the Catholic religion. Almost everyone’s duty was to behave and act like a good Catholic so that they could ascend into heaven. The consequences of sin were made so awful to frighten the faithful obedience into people with the ultimate punishments of weakening in purgatory and being sent to Hell. According to Reuterswärd, the limited number of people being admitted into Heaven “illustrates the remarkable specification contained in a treatise entitled \"Van der Vorsieningkeit Godes\", which circulated in the Netherlands in Bosch’s time, that out of 30,000 souls only two were likely to reach Heaven.” Whether Bosch read this treatise will never be known for sure, however it is known that there was a high number of monks and nuns that lived in his home city. It was even called “a pious city” because of its high quantity of confraternities and religious houses.\n\nBosch scholars have other interpretations about the meaning behind these paintings, especially Ascent of the Blessed. The panels may come off straight forward and simple but there is a lot of dispute about the order of the panels and how they should be positioned in a museum. When hung in Venice in 2011, the order of the panels was \"Fall of the Damned into Hell\", \"Hell\", space, \"Terrestrial Paradise\", and \"Ascent of the Blessed\". The \"Terrestrial Paradise\" was placed on the left because it resembles other Eden panels by Bosch, especially with its landscape, fountain, and following biblical convention. There is also confusion on whether the \"Terrestrial Paradise\" is even “paradise” because it might also be Purgatory. Another possible arrangement is \"Ascent\", \"Paradise\", \"Hell\" and the \"Fall\" which takes inspiration from Matthew 25: 32-3 in the Bible. The idea is that traditionally; God directs the damned to Hell on his left side. The Bosch scholar, Ludwig von Baldass, does not mention any other possible arrangements and feels that “the wings are divided into two portions, one above the other, representing on the left the figures of the saved being escorted by angels into Paradise and on the right the fall of the damned into Hell. Some scholars believe that Visions of the Hereafter are the wings to a missing middle panel which would presumably be the Last Judgement.\n\nCritics are not unanimous in attributing these panels to Bosch, however it would be difficult to ascribe their compositions to anyone else. There is also speculation about how these designs came to surface through Bosch, whether they are simply just from his mind or dreams. During the sixteenth-century many people would attempt to stimulate themselves into spiritual awakening to get as close to God as possible. Thus, these might have been some of the visions people saw when attempting to jump into the unconscious depth and mystery of the spiritual visions.\n\nBaldass, Ludwig von. \"Hieronymus Bosch.\" New York: Harry N.

It is a versatile hairstyle with many subvariations. Usually it is a combination of two separate styles, one for each side. An extreme variation is the \"side shave\", in which one side of the head is totally or partially shaved close.\n\nCelebrities who have sported asymmetric hairstyles include Justin Bieber, January Jones, Milla Jovovich, Kim Kardashian, Cyndi Lauper, Rihanna, Roland Orzabal, Phil Oakey, and Davey Havok of AFI. Reality television star Kate Gosselin became well known for her asymmetrical cut, which she has since changed.\n\nAsymmetric cuts can confer an aesthetic property known to professional hairdressers and cosmetologists as \"asymmetrical balance\" when they balance asymmetrical facial features. Hairdressers advise the use of an asymmetric cut for clients with asymmetrical features, such as a crooked nose, because symmetrical hairstyles draw attention to the facial asymmetries. Experts on personal appearance management in business offer the same advice. The asymmetry of the hairstyle should be opposite to that of the facial feature. Asymmetrical styles that show the ears can make the face look slimmer, and hence are advised for clients with round faces or wide-set eyes. If the client wears eyeglasses, an asymmetric cut can distract attention from them. Asymmetric cuts are often more \"trendy\" than symmetrical hairstyles.\n\nPsychological experiments have shown that hairstyle asymmetries are helpful, although not necessary, in determining whether or not an image of a familiar face has been mirror-reversed.\n"}
{"id": "8705561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8705561", "title": "Bhowani Junction (film)", "text": "Bhowani Junction (film)\n\nBhowani Junction is a 1956 film adaptation of the 1954 novel \"Bhowani Junction\" by John Masters made by MGM. The film was directed by George Cukor and produced by Pandro S. Berman from a screenplay by Sonya Levien and Ivan Moffat.\n\nThe film starred Ava Gardner as Victoria Jones, an Anglo-Indian who has been serving in the Indian Army, and Stewart Granger as Colonel Rodney Savage, a (British) Indian Army officer. It also featured Bill Travers, Abraham Sofaer, Francis Matthews, Lionel Jeffries and (uncredited) Neelo (who went on to become one of the leading ladies of the Pakistan film industry).\n\nThe film was shot in England at MGM-British Studios, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, on the Longmoor Military Railway, and on location in Lahore, Pakistan.\n\nIndia, 1947: In the final days of British rule, Victoria Jones, the daughter of an Indian mother and an English train engineer, is serving in the British Army. She returns on leave after four years to her home in Bhowani, where supporters of Mahatma Gandhi are non-violently protesting against British rule and communists, led by a revolutionary known as Davay, foment riot and sabotage.\n\nShe becomes reacquainted with a childhood sweetheart also of Anglo-Indian heritage, rail traffic superintendent Patrick Taylor, and with Colonel Rodney Savage, whose Indian battalion has been sent to Bhowani to maintain law and order as British rule ends. The protesters disrupt rail service and Savage places Victoria on duty during the crisis. He disperses the protesters but Victoria does not approve of his methods. She begins seriously contemplating her identity and speculates that she might marry a man from India, although clearly Taylor is still in love with her and Savage infatuated.\n\nWalking home alone one night, Victoria is attacked and nearly raped by Captain McDaniel, one of Savage's officers, killing him with a steel bar. Finding her, a Sikh co-worker of Taylor's, Ranjit Kasel, takes her to his home and offers her sanctuary, introducing her to his mother, the Sardarni, and to a guest in their home, Ghan Shyam, who offers to hide McDaniel's body after the Sardarni worries that her son Ranjit will be accused of murdering the officer.\n\nDavay's raids continue. He blows up a train, causing numerous deaths and injuries. Victoria, influenced by her love for India, decides to marry Ranjit, but during the ceremony fearing the complete loss of her identity, suddenly flees. When an army sentry is found murdered because he saw McDaniel and Victoria together just before she killed the officer, Victoria realizes that the man in Ranjit's home, Ghan Shyam, is actually Davay and that the Sardarni, once a notorious Indian resistance leader, has been harboring him.\n\nDavay kidnaps Victoria, using her to escape the city aboard her father's train. Savage and Taylor intercept the train before it reaches a tunnel, rescuing Victoria but finding Davay has gone into the tunnel with dynamite. Taylor recklessly advances to defuse the dynamite but is shot by Davay, who is immediately killed by Savage. Savage, cradling Taylor as he dies, watches the passage of the train. On board is Gandhi, whom Davay meant to assassinate, thereby inciting further hostilities and riots.\n\nSavage's duty in India ends and he is summoned back to England, but his love for Victoria has become overwhelming. When she refuses to marry him and live in England, he proposes to marry but remain in India, and she accepts. Savage's superior offers to expedite his early release from military service as reward for his accomplishments.\n\n\nThe film, like the original novel, portrays the Anglo-Indian protagonist, Victoria Jones, as tugged in different directions by three suitors, Col. Rodney Savage, Ranjit Kasel and Patrick Taylor, each representing a different ethnic community: British, Indian (Sikh) and Anglo-Indian, respectively. The film-makers, however, changed the novel's ending and Victoria's fate. Whereas in the novel Victoria finally seeks her future with her fellow Anglo-Indian Patrick, a railway worker, the film-makers instead matched her at the end with the more obviously dashing British officer Rodney Savage, while consigning Patrick to a heroic death.\n\nThe novel was the fourth by John Masters about India. MGM outbid two other studios to buy the film rights, paying more than $100,000. Ava Gardner and Stewart Granger were announced as leads almost immediately; Gardner had been on suspension at the studio for refusing to appear in \"Love Me or Leave Me\".\n\nGeorge Cukor was assigned to direct. He travelled to India in October 1954 to research the movie. \"I feel that for the first time India has been presented in this book as it really is, instead of the usual hokey-pokey atmosphere in which it is painted by most authors who write about it,\" he said.\n\nThe Indian government refused to cooperate with the production of the film.\n\nThe fictional location Bhowani Junction was in India, most probably Jhansi. MGM had wanted to shoot the film in location in India; but, as the government of India insisted on script approval and imposed high taxes, MGM decided to film in Pakistan where the government was more welcoming.\n\nAs a result of the change in location to Pakistan, the script was altered to show Rodney Savage in command of the 1/13 Frontier Force Battalion (Coke's Rifles), which at that time of filming was part of the 7th (Golden Arrow) Division of the Pakistan Army, rather than in command of a Gurkha Battalion, the 1/13 Gorkha Rifles, as in the book. Pakistan army and police enthusiastically assisted in making of the film. Several Pakistan army units of the 7 Golden Arrow Division including the 5th Battalion of 13th Frontier Force Rifles (now 10 Frontier Force Regiment), 5th Probyn’s Horse, 1st Battalion of 13th Frontier Force Rifles (now 7 Frontier Force Regiment), participated in the making of the film. Colonel Savage in the film is shown wearing the Golden Arrow formation sign of the Pakistan 7 Division.\n\nAlso in the movie is the 4th Battalion (Wilde's) 13th Frontier Force Rifles, the band at the Lahore Railway Station with a deer as its mascot, while the troops taking part in the train accident were from the 4/13th. The battalion has a copy of the book and autographed photographs from both Ava Gardner and Stewart Granger.\n\nThe future Pakistani film star Neelo appeared in a small role as a reporter in a crowd scene. Neelo was introduced to Cukor by A. H. Rana, the film's production manager and casting assistant in Pakistan, who worked with the film's casting director, Harvey Woods. This was her first role in a movie.\n\nThe film earned $2,075,000 in North America and $2.8 million elsewhere, making a profit of $1,238,000.\n\nIt recorded admissions of 1,554,970 in France.\n\n\n"}

Thiel also translated works by Nietzsche into Swedish.\n\nErnest Thiel's parents were the Belgian Catholic engineer Jacques Thiel and Fanny Stiebel, of German-Jewish origin. After school in Stockholm, Thiel was sent to Germany to learn trade in a Hamburg merchant house, and later worked in a bank there. He returned to Stockholm in 1877 and found work in Stockholms Enskilda Bank, the bank of the Wallenberg family. In 1884 he became the manager of the Stockholm office of Hernösands enskilda bank and in 1891 he had accumulated enough capital to start his own bank, Stockholms Kredit- och Diskontoförening, later known as Aktiebolaget Stockholms diskontobank, which he headed until 1901. In 1884 he had married Anna Josephson, member of a well-known Jewish family and sister-in-law of the publisher Karl Otto Bonnier. He caused a scandal when he divorced her (1896–97) to marry Signe Hansen, a young and beautiful widow with literary and artistic interests who had been his wife's companion.\n\nThiel's art collecting began in earnest in 1901, when he bought art for the then considerable sum of 19,000 crowns at the exhibition of the Konstnärsförbundet artist group. The following year he bought 19 paintings by Bruno Liljefors. The flat at Strandvägen into which he had moved with second wife in 1897 started to be cramped, and in 1904, Thiel commissioned the architect Ferdinand Boberg to build him a large villa at Blockhusudden in the Djurgården park area of Stockholm. It was soon discovered that the art collection had outgrown the building and Boberg had to add another large room in 1905. Prince Eugen, the painter and collector, had recently had Boberg design a combined residence and art gallery at Waldemarsudde in another part of Djurgården, which may have influenced Thiel. The Prince originally counteracted Thiel's plans and forced him to move his new house to a spot farther away from Waldemarsudde than he had first wanted, but when, in 1906, Eugen gave Thiel a painting of his, \"Nattmolnet\" (The Night Cloud) it was a sign that he had accepted his position in the art life of Sweden.\n\n"}

{"id": "245808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=245808", "title": "Golden Legend", "text": "Golden Legend\n\nThe Golden Legend (Latin: \"Legenda aurea\" or \"Legenda sanctorum\") is a collection of hagiographies by Blessed Jacobus de Varagine that was widely read in late medieval Europe. More than a thousand manuscripts of the text have survived. It was likely compiled around the year 1260, although the text was added to over the centuries.\n\nInitially entitled \"Legenda sanctorum\" (\"Readings of the Saints\"), it gained its popularity under the title by which it is best known. It overtook and eclipsed earlier compilations of abridged legendaria, the \"Abbreviatio in gestis et miraculis sanctorum\" attributed to the Dominican chronicler Jean de Mailly and the \"Epilogus in gestis sanctorum\" of the Dominican preacher Bartholomew of Trent. Over eight hundred manuscript copies of the work survive, and when printing was invented in the 1450s, editions appeared quickly, not only in Latin, but also in every major European language. Among \"incunabula\", printed before 1501, \"Legenda aurea\" was printed in more editions than the Bible. It was one of the first books William Caxton printed in the English language; Caxton's version appeared in 1483 and his translation was reprinted, reaching a ninth edition in 1527. \n\nWritten in simple, readable Latin, the book was read in its day for its stories. The book is considered the closest to an encyclopaedia of medieval saint lore that survives today; as such it is invaluable to art historians and medievalists who seek to identify saints depicted in art by their deeds and attributes. Its repetitious nature is explained if Jacobus da Varagine meant to write a compendium of saintly lore for sermons and preaching, not a work of popular entertainment.\n\nThe book sought to compile traditional lore about all of the saints venerated at the time of its compilation. Jacobus da Varagine typically begins with an (often fanciful) etymology for the saint's name. An example (in Caxton's translation) shows his method:\n\nAs a Latin author, Jacobus da Varagine must have known that \"Silvester\", a relatively common Latin name, simply meant \"from the forest\". The correct derivation is alluded to in the text, but set out in parallel to fanciful ones that lexicographers would consider quite wide of the mark. Even the \"correct\" explanations (\"silvas\", \"forest\", and the mention of green boughs) are used as the basis for an allegorical interpretation. Jacobus da Varagine's etymologies had different goals from modern etymologies, and cannot be judged by the same standards. Jacobus' etymologies have parallels in Isidore of Seville's \"Etymologiae\", in which linguistically accurate derivations are set out beside allegorical and figurative explanations.\n\nJacobus da Varagine then moves on to the saint's life, compiled with reference to the readings from the Roman Catholic Church's liturgy commemorating that saint; then embellishes the biography with supernatural tales of incidents involving the saint's life.\n\nThe chapter \"St Pelagius, Pope and the History of the Lombards\" begins with the story of St Pelagius, then proceeds to touch upon events surrounding the origin and history of the Lombards in Europe leading up to the 7th century when the story of Muhammad begins. The story then goes on to describe \"Magumeth (Mahomet, Muhammad)\" as \"a false prophet and sorcerer\", detailing his early life and travels as a merchant through his marriage to the widow, Khadija and goes on to suggest his \"visions\" came as a result of epileptic seizures and the interventions of a renegade Nestorian monk named Sergius. The chapter conveys the medieval Christian understanding of the beliefs of Saracens and other Muslims.\n\nMany of the stories also conclude with miracle tales and similar wonderlore from accounts of those who called upon that saint for aid or used the saint's relics. Such a tale is told of Saint Agatha; Jacobus da Varagine has pagans in Catania repairing to the relics of St. Agatha to supernaturally repel an eruption of Mount Etna:\n\nAnd for to prove that she had prayed for the salvation of the country, at the beginning of February, the year after her martyrdom, there arose a great fire, and came from the mountain toward the city of Catania and burnt the earth and stones, it was so fervent. Then ran the paynims to the sepulchre of S. Agatha and took the cloth that lay upon her tomb, and held it abroad against the fire, and anon on the ninth day after, which was the day of her feast, ceased the fire as soon as it came to the cloth that they brought from her tomb, showing that our Lord kept the city from the said fire by the merits of S. Agatha.\n\nA substantial portion of Jacobus' text was drawn from two epitomes of collected lives of the saints, both also arranged in the order of the liturgical year, written by members of his Dominican order: one is Jean de Mailly's lengthy \"Abbreviatio in gestis et miraculis sanctorum\" (\"Summary of the Deeds and Miracles of the Saints\") and the other is Bartholomew of Trent's \"Epilogum in gesta sanctorum\" (\"Afterword on the Deeds of the Saints\"). The many extended parallels to text found in Vincent de Beauvais' \"Speculum historiale\", the main encyclopedia that was used in the Middle Ages, are attributed by modern scholars to the two authors' common compilation of identical sources, rather than to Jacobus' reading Vincent's encyclopedia. More than 130 more distant sources have been identified for the tales related of the saints in the \"Golden Legend\", few of which have a nucleus in the New Testament itself; these hagiographic sources include apocryphal texts such as the \"Gospel of Nicodemus\", and the histories of Gregory of Tours and John Cassian. Many of his stories have no other known source. A typical example of the sort of story related, also involving St. Silvester, shows the saint receiving miraculous instruction from Saint Peter in a vision that enables him to exorcise a dragon:\n\nIn this time it happed that there was at Rome a dragon in a pit, which every day slew with his breath more than three hundred men. Then came the bishops of the idols unto the emperor and said unto him: O thou most holy emperor, sith the time that thou hast received Christian faith the dragon which is in yonder fosse or pit slayeth every day with his breath more than three hundred men. Then sent the emperor for S. Silvester and asked counsel of him of this matter. S. Silvester answered that by the might of God he promised to make him cease of his hurt and blessure of this people. Then S. Silvester put himself to prayer, and S. Peter appeared to him and said: \"Go surely to the dragon and the two priests that be with thee take in thy company, and when thou shalt come to him thou shalt say to him in this manner: Our Lord Jesus Christ which was born of the Virgin Mary, crucified, buried and arose, and now sitteth on the right side of the Father, this is he that shall come to deem and judge the living and the dead, I commend thee Sathanas that thou abide him in this place till he come. Then thou shalt bind his mouth with a thread, and seal it with thy seal, wherein is the imprint of the cross. Then thou and the two priests shall come to me whole and safe, and such bread as I shall make ready for you ye shall eat.Thus as S. Peter had said, S. Silvester did. And when he came to the pit, he descended down one hundred and fifty steps, bearing with him two lanterns, and found the dragon, and said the words that S. Peter had said to him, and bound his mouth with the thread, and sealed it, and after returned, and as he came upward again he met with two enchanters which followed him for to see if he descended, which were almost dead of the stench of the dragon, whom he brought with him whole and sound, which anon were baptized, with a great multitude of people with them. Thus was the city of Rome delivered from double death, that was from the culture and worshiping of false idols, and from the venom of the dragon.\n\nJacobus had his limits; he describes the story of Saint Margaret of Antioch surviving being swallowed by a dragon as \"apocryphal and not to be taken seriously\" (trans. Ryan, 1.369).\n\nThe adverse reaction to \"Legenda aurea\" under critical scrutiny in the 16th century was led by scholars who reexamined the criteria for judging hagiographic sources and found \"Legenda aurea\" wanting; prominent among the humanists were two disciples of Erasmus, Georg Witzel, in the preface to his \"Hagiologium\", and Juan Luis Vives in \"De disciplinis\". Criticism among members of Jacobus' Dominican order were muted by the increased reverence towards the archbishop, which culminated in his beatification in 1815. The rehabilitation of \"Legenda aurea\" in the 20th century, now interpreted as a mirror of the heartfelt pieties of the 13th century, is attributed to Téodor de Wyzewa, whose retranslation into French, and its preface, have been often reprinted.\n\nThe critical edition of the Latin text has been edited by Giovanni Paolo Maggioni (Florence: SISMEL 1998). In 1900, the Caxton version was updated into more modern English by Frederick Startridge Ellis, and published in seven volumes. Jacobus da Varagine's original was translated into French around the same time by Téodor de Wyzewa. A modern English translation of the \"Golden Legend\" has been published by William Granger Ryan, and (2 volumes).\n\nA modern translation of the \"Golden Legend\" is available from Fordham University's Medieval Sourcebook.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5286935", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5286935", "title": "Heraldic visitation", "text": "Heraldic visitation\n\nHeraldic visitations were tours of inspection undertaken by Kings of Arms (and more often by junior officers of arms (or Heralds) as deputies) throughout England, Wales and Ireland. Their purpose was to regulate and register the coats of arms of nobility and gentry and boroughs, and to record pedigrees. They took place from 1530 to 1688, and their records (akin to an upper class census) provide important source material for historians and genealogists.\n\nBy the fifteenth century, the use and abuse of coats of arms was becoming widespread in England. One of the duties conferred on William Bruges (or Brydges), the first Garter Principal King of Arms was to survey and record the armorial bearings and pedigrees of those using coats of arms and correct irregularities. Officers of arms had made occasional tours of various parts of the kingdom to enquire about armorial matters during the fifteenth century, however, it was not until the sixteenth century that the process began in earnest.\n\nThe first provincial visitations were carried out under warrant granted by Henry VIII to Thomas Benolt, Clarenceux King of Arms dated 6 April 1530. He was commissioned to travel throughout his province (i.e. south of the Trent) with authority to enter all homes and churches. Upon entering these premises, he was authorized to \"put down or otherwise deface at his discretion... those arms unlawfully used\". He was also required to enquire into all those using the titles of knight, esquire, or gentleman and decided if they were being lawfully used.\n\nBy this writ, Henry VIII also compelled the sheriffs and mayors of each county or city visited by the officers of arms to give aid and assistance in gathering the needed information. When a King of Arms, or Herald, visited a county, his presence was proclaimed by presenting the King's royal commission to the local gentry and nobility, which required them to provide evidence of their right to use a coat of arms. The Sheriff would collect from the bailiff of each hundred within his county a list of all people using titles or arms. \n\nIn the early days, the visiting herald would tour the homes of the gentry and nobility, but from the late 1560s these persons were summoned to attend a central \"place of sitting\" – usually an inn – at a particular time. They were to bring their arms, and proof of their right to use them, most often by way of detailing their ancestral right to them, which would also be recorded. Where an official grant of arms had been made, this was also recorded. Other ancient arms, many of which predated the establishment of the College of Arms, were confirmed. The officer would record the information clearly and make detailed notes that could be entered into the records of the College of Arms when the party returned to London. \n\nThese volumes now make up the collection of Visitation Books at the College, which contain a wealth of information about all armigerous people from the period. If the officers of arms were not presented with sufficient proof of the right to use a coat of arms, they were also empowered to deface monuments which bore these arms and to force persons bearing such arms to sign a disclaimer that they would cease using them. The visitations were not always popular with members of the landed gentry, who were required to present proof of their gentility.\n\nFollowing the accession of William III in 1689, no further commissions to carry out visitations were commanded. The reasons behind this cessation of the programme have been a matter of debate among historians. Philip Styles, for example, related it to a declining willingness of members of the gentry to attend visitations, which he traced to a growing proportion of \"newly risen\" families, who lacked long pedigrees and were therefore apathetic about registering them. However, Janet Verasano has challenged this interpretation, finding that (in Staffordshire, at least) gentry enthusiasm for coats of arms as an enhancement to social standing persisted to the end of the 17th century. The end of the visitations did not have much effect on those counties far removed from London, some of which had only been rarely visited over the entire period of the visitations.\n\nThere was never a systematic visitation of Wales. There were four visitations in the principality, and on 9 June 1551, Fulk ap Hywel, Lancaster Herald of Arms in Ordinary was given a commission to visit all of Wales. This was not carried out, however, as he was degraded and executed for counterfeiting the seal of Clarenceux King of Arms. This is regrettable, since no visitation of all Wales was ever made by the officers of arms.\n\nThe principal records to emerge from the visitations were pedigrees, initially recorded on loose sheets of paper, and afterwards bound together as notebooks. In some cases, the sheets would include blank shields which had been drawn in advance (or at a later date printed), to simplify the process of recording coats of arms. The persons whose pedigrees were recorded were required (from about 1570 onwards) to certify them by signature, and where these original draft pedigrees have survived they are known as \"originals with signatures\". The signed copies were taken back to the College of Arms, where fair copies were made to a higher standard and preserved as the \"office copies\". Sometimes the signed copies were also retained at the College, but in other cases, no longer considered of official interest, they might pass into private hands: once in general circulation, further copies were often made, which might in turn be revised or augmented. As a result, a number of variant manuscript copies of any one visitation record may now survive, possessing varying degrees of accuracy and authority. The Harleian Collection of the British Library is particularly rich in such records. Many visitation records have been published over the years, by the Harleian Society, by county record societies, and a few privately (see listing below). However, because until relatively recently the College of Arms restricted access to its records, many of the older published editions were necessarily based on the unofficial second- or third-generation copies in other collections, and may therefore not always be reliable.\n\nFrom as early as the 1530s, officers of arms on visitation frequently also compiled what were known as \"church notes\". These were fieldnotes (usually in the form of sketches) of coats of arms observed on church monuments, in stained glass windows, or on display in private houses. Sometimes, drawings were also made of non-heraldic antiquities, such as medieval architectural features, views of towns, Roman inscriptions and even Stonehenge.\n\nThe 17th-century visitations generated a growing number of supplementary papers, including warrants, lists of persons who disclaimed any pretence to arms, lists of persons summoned to appear before the heralds (including those who had not appeared), records of fees paid, and miscellaneous correspondence.\n\nVisitations were conducted by or in the name of the two provincial Kings of Arms, Clarenceux and Norroy, within their respective provinces. In the following lists, the Deputies are the officers of arms who actually carried out the visitations. Where no Deputy is named, the visitation can be assumed to have been conducted by the King of Arms in person.\n\nThe Southern Province, the jurisdiction of Clarenceux King of Arms, comprised that part of England south of the River Trent, i.e. the counties of Bedford, Berks, Buckingham, Cambridge, Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Essex, Gloucester, Hereford, Hertford, Huntingdon, Kent, Leicester, Lincoln, Middlesex, Monmouth, Norfolk, Northampton, Oxford, Rutland, Salop, Somerset, Southampton, Suffolk, Surrey, Sussex, Warwick, Wilton, Worcester, and the City of London; and South Wales.\n\nThe Northern Province, the jurisdiction of Norroy King of Arms, comprised that part of England north of the River Trent, i.e. the counties of Chester, Cumberland, Derby, Durham, Lancaster, Northumberland, Nottingham, Stafford, Westmorland and York; and North Wales. The Trent ran through Staffordshire, and the county was therefore technically divided between the two provinces; but for the purposes of visitation it was generally treated (sometimes through a process of deputation) as falling under the jurisdiction of Norroy.\n\nSince the practices of Ulster King of Arms so closely followed those of the English College of Arms, it is hardly surprising that the Irish officers of arms undertook heraldic visitations in their province. The purpose behind these visitations was twofold: to prevent the assumption of arms by unqualified people, and to record the arms of the gentry that were unknown to Ulster office. The first visitation was held by Nicholas Narbon, the second Ulster King of Arms, in 1569. He was authorized to reform practices which were contrary to good armorial practice. He conducted six visitations (Dublin in 1568–1573, Drogheda and Ardee in 1570, Dublin in 1572, Swords in 1572, Cork in 1574, and Limerick in 1574). One of his successors, Daniel Molyneux had the commission renewed, and mounted several visitations. Although Molyneux's last visitation – of Wexford – was the last proper visitation, two other expeditions occurred after 1618 by subsequent Ulster Kings of Arms. The visitations were not very extensive. The officers would not often be found in the disturbed countryside. Thus the visitations are confined to areas under firm control of the Dublin administration.\n\nToday, the original visitation and related manuscripts are in the custody of the Chief Herald of Ireland. Copies are also deposited at the College of Arms in London.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(see also: Cornish heraldry)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Bharathiraja. The film's script was co-written by M. Rathna Kumar. The film's score and soundtrack are composed by A. R. Rahman. The film met with critical acclaim upon release and received accolades. It stars Rajashree played titular role in her debut with Raja, Saranya and debutante Maheswari played lead with Vadivukkarasi, Ponvannan and Janagaraj played pivotal role.\n\nThe soundtrack of the film by Academy Award winner A. R. Rahman is hailed as a masterpiece. The track Porale Ponnuthayi won a National Film Award for its singer Swarnalatha.\n\nMokkatha (Vani), a wife of Mokkaiyan (Periyar Dasan), a farmer in Pottalpetti village, is in labour. They already have two daughters and are keen to have a son; two daughters born earlier were killed soon after birth by feeding them with poisonous cactus extract. Unable to pay hefty dowries for their daughters marriage, the villagers consider female infanticide to be acceptable. A new school teacher (R. Sundarrajan) feels sad on learning about this heinous practice. When Mokkatha delivers a girl again, Mokkaiyan orders the village midwife (S. N. Lakshmi) to kill the baby. The midwife sadly tries to feed the cactus extract to the baby at a secluded place. The school teacher notices, meets her and requests to handover the infant so that he can bring up her. She hands over and he moves away from the village with the child.\n\nAs years roll by, Stephen (Raja), a veterinary doctor, comes to the village. Mokkaiyan's first daughter Ponnatha (Saranya Ponvannan) is married to Thavasi (Ponvannan), the son of Mokkaiya's nefarious sister. The second daughter Karuthamma (Rajashree) takes care of the family. After getting into some tiff with Stephen, Karuthamma falls in love with him.\n\nPonnatha has two daughters, and is pregnant for the third time. Unfortunately, when a girl is born again, Kaliamma (Vadivukkarasi), her mother-in-law and Mokkaiyan's sister, orders to kill it. To save her child, Ponnatha escapes with her baby and is chased by Thavasi, who beats her to death; the child also dies. He and Kaliamma enact a drama that Ponnatha committed suicide as her third child also a girl.\n\nKaruthamma, devastated with the death of her sister, does not believe this story. Ponnatha had earlier expressed her fear to her that if she delivered a girl again, Kaliamma would kill her. When Karuthamma is giving a ceremonial bath to Ponnatha's baby, she notices bloodstains on her abdomen. Concluding that she was murdered, Karuthamma stops the funeral and rushes to complain to the police. The village chairman Chellamuthu (Kamalasekhar), who is close to Thavasi, asks the police not to intervene, hence the police do not. Karuthamma refuses to leave the station. Stephen, who is passing by, threatens action against the police if they do not act on her complaint, as he is also a government employee. Left with no option, the police take Ponnatha's body away and arrest Thavasi and Kaliamma.\n\nDr. Rosy (Maheswari), a teacher's daughter, comes to meet her close relative Stephen. Her presence and closeness with Stephen is misunderstood by Karuthamma. Rosy loves Stephen, but he only likes her. Kaliamma's husband (Janagaraj) celebrates her arrest by drinking with Mokkaiyan, who is not used to liquor. Mokkaiyan suffers a paralytic attack and loses control of his limbs. Rosy attends to him and in the process gets attached to Mokkaiyan and Karuthamma.\n\nA few weeks later, when Thavasi and Kaliamma get bail, they come to attack Karuthamma, but Stephen saves her. Chellamuthu manipulates the villagers to accept Thavasi's proposal that Karuthamma must marry Thavasi to take care of Ponnatha's two young daughters (by which the police case will also be closed). Chellamuthu, who has lent money to Mokkaiyan, threatens and seeks immediate repayment if he does not accept this proposal.\n\nThavasi's father realises that his son is using the young children as bait and takes away the children with him one night. However, he is caught by Thavasi, who, motivated by Chellamuthu, burns his father to death. Thavasi takes the children away and forces Karuthamma to come with him to their village to marry him. Shocked with all this, Mokkaiyan consumes poison and is on his deathbed.\n\nWhen Rosy expresses her love to Stephen, he gets surprised and states that he loves Karuthamma. Rosy is shocked as she was keen to marry him and decides to move away from the village. When the villagers asks her to treat Mokkaiyan who is fighting for his life, she does not as she is keen to leave. When her father, the teacher arrives, the village midwife realises that he is the same person who took Mokkiayan's third daughter. The midwife reveals to Rosy that Mokkaiyan is her real father; the school teacher also confirms it. Rosy treats Mokkaiyan, who now realises his mistake of killing female infants without realizing their worth.\n\nKaruthamma, on the eve of her wedding, demands to see the children take away earlier by Thavasi's father. However, Thavasi is unable to show his children (as they were taken by Chellamuthu to use them as bait to force himself on Karuthamma). That night Chellamuthu makes Thavasi drunk and asks him to spare Karuthamma for that night. Thavasi agrees in a drunken state, which is overheard by Karuthamma, who also comes to know that Thavasi had killed his own father. When Chellamuthu goes to meet Karuthamma, she is well prepared to meet him. She murders Chellamuthu and then Thavasi. After saving Ponnatha's children, who were locked inside a box, she returns to her village. Realising that Rosy is her own sister, Karuthamma asks her to look after the children and their father and leaves with the police. Stephen is sad but decides to wait for her.\n\nThe film's title was named after Bharathiraja's mother. The film's story was based on a real-life incident in a village and the script was written by Bharathiraja's assistant M. Rathnakumar.\n\nPeriyar Dasan who worked as professor in Pachaiyappa's college made his acting debut with this film. Rajashree and Maheswari, who is the cousin of actress Sridevi made their acting debuts in this film.\n\nThe film was a milestone in the annals of Tamil cinema, addressed the heinous act of female foeticide prevalent in Tamil Nadu during that time. This hard hitting film highlights this crime and created huge awareness among the people and officials, which led to the banning of the practice of prenatal sex identification across country. It was received with critical acclaim and received many accolades. The film looks at female infanticide and the hatred that surrounds the birth of a female child. A father blames his miseries on the birth of his daughters. Set in a rural village. \"Karuthamma\" was released to critical acclaim.\n\nBharathiraja once mentioned that \"Karuththamma\" is the finest film in his career. Such was his attachment to the theme of this film. The practice of gender identification of the foetus and terminating pregnancy for female foetuses was becoming a rampant practice in India. This film highlighted the next level of crime — killing female infants — which created mass awareness on the practice. The Government of Tamil Nadu initiated several new policies to prevent and control this practice in the last 15 Years. A new law across the country banning gender identification of foetus also saved millions of girls lives and maintenance of a healthy sex ratio.\n\nThe soundtrack of the film features score and 7 songs composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics by Vairamuthu.\n\nThe soundtrack proved popular upon release. A. R. Rahman demonstrated his skills in composing for smaller budget films, reflecting themes of rural life, equally effectively. The songs gained A.R.

Besides, he did not fail to pose a question in the end of the movie, serving his part in making the viewer socially conscious\". \"Karuththamma\" touched upon the emotionally sensitive subject of killing female infants and hence was widely appreciated. The intense story, super hit and youthful music from A. R. Rahman and fine direction by Bharathiraja added sheen to the film. It remains a milestone in Tamil Cinema for bringing to light the menaces in the society and putting an end to them through law.\"Ananda Vikatan\" in its review(04-12-1994) mentioned that \"Though the subject taken up was delicate, instead of making a documentary, the director has narrated the film, through visuals, which should be appreciated. Bharathiraja must be congratulated for making a heart — wrenching film on a delicate subject without lecturing us on the theme\". The film was given 45 Marks.\n\nThe film ran for over 100 days. The first film to bring to light the menace of Female infanticide on screen, \"Karuththamma\" forced the Government at National and State level to act against this practice and bring in suitable laws to curb it. It became a catalyst for this change in the society and was recognised with both National and State Awards.\n\nThe film has won the following awards since its release:\n\n1994 National Film Awards (India)\n\n1994 Tamil Nadu State Film Awards\n\n1994 Filmfare Awards South\n\nIn \"Kadhal Sadugudu\" (2003), Theni Kunjarammal tries to kill a female child with milk, Super Subbu (Vivek) who witnesses this says that he has been seeing this from the days of \"Karuthamma\".

Awards given for this profession in the entertainment industry include the Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling and even several entertainment industry awards such as the Emmy Awards and the Golden Globes. In the United States as well as the other parts of the globe, professional licenses are required by agencies in order for them to hire the MUA. Bigger production companies have in-house makeup artists on their payroll although most MUA’s generally are freelance and their times remain flexible depending on the projects. The use of digital cameras may have made the use of bridal make up more popular.\n\nFashion makeup is used in magazine photography as well as on the fashion runway. Avant-garde makeup is also an applicable technique used for projects that require experimental themes. Fashion makeup is also commonly used in television and film ranging for the natural \"prime look\" to more sophisticated applications such as \"color balance\".\nStage makeup is used as a method in conjunction with stage lighting to highlight the actors' faces in order to make expressions visible to the audience from moderate distances. This often includes defining the eyes and lips as well as the highlights and lowlights of the facial bones.\n\nThe use of special effects techniques enhancing physical features to exhibit as well as fantasy makeup. The use of prosthetics and plaster casting are also required for projects that entails non-human appearances. Accents such as theatrical blood and ooze are also techniques applicable to this type of makeup.\nThe use of an airbrush which is a small air-operated device that sprays various media some products and water-based makeup by a process of nebulization. The earliest record of this type of cosmetic application dates back to the 1925 film version of Ben-Hur, it has recently been re-popularized by the advent of HDTV and digital photography, where the camera focuses on higher depths of detail. Liquid foundations that are high in coverage but thin in consistency are applied with the airbrush for full coverage without a heavy build-up of product.\nBridal makeup is a new segment in a makeup artist's repertoire. From ethnic, to glamorous, to contemporary, makeup artists are now an important part of wedding planning in Asia, Europe, Africa and North America.\nThis is an art which involves the use of light reflectors and ingredients such as minerals to give the skin a flawless finish. This was developed due to the further development of high definition mediums and the cost implications of airbrush makeup.\n\nIn 1955 the Bollywood group Cine Costume Make-Up Artist & Hair Dressers' Association (CCMAA) created a rule that did not allow women to obtain memberships as makeup artists. However, in 2014 the Supreme Court of India ruled that this rule was in violation of the Indian constitutional guarantees granted under Article 14 (right to equality), 19(1)(g) (freedom to carry out any profession) and Article 21 (right to liberty). The judges of the Supreme Court of India stated that the ban on women makeup artist members had no \"rationale nexus\" to the cause sought to be achieved and was \"unacceptable, impermissible and inconsistent\" with the constitutional rights guaranteed to the citizens. The Court also found illegal the rule which mandated that for any artist, female or male, to work in the industry, they must have domicile status of five years in the state where they intend to work. In 2015 it was announced that Charu Khurana had become the first woman to be registered by the Cine Costume Make-Up Artist & Hair Dressers' Association.\n\nIn June 2014, the Cine Costume Make-Up Artist & Hair Dressers' Association (CCMAA) authorised an official protest on the movie set of Bang Bang! in protest of a foreign makeup artist, Daniel Bauer working on the movie for its lead actress, Katrina Kaif. The CCMAA and 15 of its members protested on the movie set as Daniel Bauer was not registered with the Union, despite the Union banning foreign artists working in Bollywood.

{"id": "62038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62038", "title": "Man Ray", "text": "Man Ray\n\nMan Ray (born Emmanuel Radnitzky; August 27, 1890 – November 18, 1976) was an American visual artist who spent most of his career in Paris. He was a significant contributor to the Dada and Surrealist movements, although his ties to each were informal. He produced major works in a variety of media but considered himself a painter above all. He was best known for his photography, and he was a renowned fashion and portrait photographer. Man Ray is also noted for his work with photograms, which he called \"rayographs\" in reference to himself.\n\nDuring his career as an artist, Man Ray allowed few details of his early life or family background to be known to the public. He even refused to acknowledge that he ever had a name other than Man Ray.\n\nMan Ray's birth name was Emmanuel Radnitzky in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, US, in 1890. He was the eldest child of Russian Jewish immigrants Max, a tailor, and Minnie Radnitzky. He had a brother, Sam, and two sisters, Dora and Essie, the youngest born in 1897 shortly after they settled in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. In early 1912, the Radnitzky family changed their surname to Ray. Man Ray's brother chose the surname in reaction to the ethnic discrimination and antisemitism prevalent at the time. Emmanuel, who was called \"Manny\" as a nickname, changed his first name to Man and gradually began to use Man Ray as his name.\nMan Ray's father worked in a garment factory and ran a small tailoring business out of the family home. He enlisted his children to assist him from an early age. Man Ray's mother enjoyed designing the family's clothes and inventing patchwork items from scraps of fabric. Man Ray wished to disassociate himself from his family background, but their tailoring left an enduring mark on his art. Mannequins, flat irons, sewing machines, needles, pins, threads, swatches of fabric, and other items related to tailoring appear in almost every medium of his work. Art historians have noted similarities between Ray's collage and painting techniques and styles used for tailoring.\n\nMason Klein, curator of a Man Ray exhibition at the Jewish Museum in New York, \"Alias Man Ray: The Art of Reinvention\", suggests that the artist may have been \"the first Jewish avant-garde artist.\"\n\nMan Ray was the uncle of the photographer Naomi Savage, who learned some of his techniques and incorporated them into her own work.\n\nMan Ray displayed artistic and mechanical abilities during childhood. His education at Brooklyn's Boys' High School from 1904 to 1909 provided him with solid grounding in drafting and other basic art techniques. While he attended school, he educated himself with frequent visits to the local art museums, where he studied the works of the Old Masters. After his graduation, Ray was offered a scholarship to study architecture but chose to pursue a career as an artist. Man Ray's parents were disappointed by their son's decision to pursue art, but they agreed to rearrange the family's modest living quarters so that Ray's room could be his studio. The artist remained in the family home over the next four years. During this time, he worked steadily towards becoming a professional painter. Man Ray earned money as a commercial artist and was a technical illustrator at several Manhattan companies.\n\nThe surviving examples of his work from this period indicate that he attempted mostly paintings and drawings in 19th-century styles. He was already an avid admirer of contemporary avant-garde art, such as the European modernists he saw at Alfred Stieglitz's \"291\" gallery and works by the Ashcan School. However, with a few exceptions, he was not yet able to integrate these trends into his own work. The art classes he sporadically attended, including stints at the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League, were of little apparent benefit to him. When he enrolled in the Ferrer School in the autumn of 1912, he began a period of intense and rapid artistic development.\n\nWhile living in New York City, Man Ray was visually influenced by the 1913 Armory Show and galleries of European contemporary works. His early paintings display facets of cubism. After befriending Marcel Duchamp, who was interested in showing movement in static paintings, his works began to depict movement of the figures. An example is the repetitive positions of the dancer's skirts in \"The Rope Dancer Accompanies Herself with Her Shadows\" (1916).\n\nIn 1915, Man Ray had his first solo show of paintings and drawings after he had taken up residence at an art colony in Grantwood, New Jersey, across the Hudson River from New York City. His first proto-Dada object, an assemblage titled \"Self-Portrait\", was exhibited the following year. He produced his first significant photographs in 1918.\n\nMan Ray abandoned conventional painting to involve himself with Dada, a radical anti-art movement. He started making objects and developed unique mechanical and photographic methods of making images. For the 1918 version of \"Rope Dancer\", he combined a spray-gun technique with a pen drawing. Like Duchamp, he did \"readymades\"—ordinary objects that are selected and modified. His \"Gift\" readymade (1921) is a flatiron with metal tacks attached to the bottom, and \"Enigma of Isidore Ducasse\" is an unseen object (a sewing machine) wrapped in cloth and tied with cord. \"Aerograph\" (1919), another work from this period, was done with airbrush on glass.\n\nIn 1920, Man Ray helped Duchamp make the \"Rotary Glass Plates\", one of the earliest examples of kinetic art. It was composed of glass plates turned by a motor. That same year, Man Ray, Katherine Dreier, and Duchamp founded the Société Anonyme, an itinerant collection that was the first museum of modern art in the U.S. In 1941 the collection was donated to Yale University Art Gallery.\n\nMan Ray teamed up with Duchamp to publish one issue of \"New York Dada\" in 1920. For Man Ray, Dada's experimentation was no match for the wild and chaotic streets of New York. He wrote that \"Dada cannot live in New York. All New York is dada, and will not tolerate a rival.\"\n\nIn 1913, Man Ray met his first wife, the Belgian poet Adon Lacroix (Donna Lecoeur) (1887–1975), in New York. They married in 1914, separated in 1919, and formally divorced in 1937.\n\nIn July 1921, Man Ray went to live and work in Paris, France. He soon settled in the Montparnasse quarter favored by many artists. Shortly after arriving in Paris, he met and fell in love with Kiki de Montparnasse (Alice Prin), an artists' model and celebrated character in Paris bohemian circles. Kiki was Man Ray's companion for most of the 1920s. She became the subject of some of his most famous photographic images and starred in his experimental films, \"Le Retour à la Raison\" and \"L'Étoile de mer\". In 1929, he began a love affair with the Surrealist photographer Lee Miller. Miller left him in 1932.\n\nFor the next 20 years in Montparnasse, Man Ray was a distinguished photographer. Significant members of the art world, such as James Joyce, Gertrude Stein, Jean Cocteau, Bridget Bate Tichenor, and Antonin Artaud, posed for his camera.\n\nMan Ray was represented in the first Surrealist exhibition with Jean Arp, Max Ernst, André Masson, Joan Miró, and Pablo Picasso at the Galerie Pierre in Paris in 1925. Important works from this time were a metronome with an eye, originally titled \"Object to Be Destroyed\", and the \"Violon d'Ingres,\" a stunning photograph of Kiki de Montparnasse, styled after the painter/musician Ingres. \"Violon d'Ingres\" is a popular example of how Man Ray could juxtapose disparate elements in his photography to generate meaning.\n\nIn 1934, surrealist artist Méret Oppenheim, known for her fur-covered teacup, posed nude for Man Ray in a well-known series of photographs depicting her standing next to a printing press.\n\nWith Lee Miller, his photographic assistant and lover, Man Ray reinvented the photographic technique of solarization. He also created a type of photogram he called \"rayographs\", which he described as \"pure dadaism\".\n\nMan Ray was in a relationship with the model Adrienne Fidelin during some time between 1936 and 1940, the two parting ways after Ray fled the Nazi occupation in France, while Adrienne chose to stay behind to care for her family.\n\nMan Ray directed a number of influential avant-garde short films, known as \"Cinéma Pur\". He directed \"Le Retour à la Raison\" (2 mins, 1923); \"Emak-Bakia\" (16 mins, 1926); \"L'Étoile de Mer\" (15 mins, 1928); and \"Les Mystères du Château de Dé\" (27 mins, 1929). Man Ray also assisted Marcel Duchamp with the cinematography of his film \"Anemic Cinema\" (1926), and Ray personally manned the camera on Fernand Léger's \"Ballet Mécanique\" (1924). In René Clair's film \"Entr'acte\" (1924), Man Ray appeared in a brief scene playing chess with Duchamp.\n\nDuchamp, Man Ray, and Francis Picabia were friends and collaborators. The three were connected by their experimental, entertaining, and innovative art.\n\nMan Ray was forced to return from Paris to the United States due to the Second World War. He lived in Los Angeles from 1940 to 1951 where he focused his creative energy on painting. A few days after arriving in Los Angeles, Man Ray met Juliet Browner, a first-generation American of Romanian-Jewish lineage. She was a trained dancer, who studied dance with Martha Graham, and an experienced artists' model. The two married in 1946 in a double wedding with their friends Max Ernst and Dorothea Tanning. In 1948 Man Ray had a solo exhibition at the Copley Galleries in Beverly Hills, which brought together a wide array of work and featured his newly painted canvases of the \"Shakespearean Equations\" series.\n\nMan Ray returned to Paris in 1951, and settled with Juliet into a studio at 2 bis rue Ferou near the Luxembourg Gardens in St. Germain des Pres, where he continued his creative practice across mediums. During the last quarter century of his life, he returned to a number of his iconic earlier works, recreating them in new form. He also directed the production of limited-edition replicas of several of his objects, working first with Marcel Zerbib and later Arturo Schwarz.\n\nIn 1963, he published his autobiography, \"Self-Portrait\", which was republished in 1999.\n\nHe died in Paris on November 18, 1976, from a lung infection. He was interred in the Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris. Ray's epitaph reads \"unconcerned, but not indifferent\". When Juliet Browner died in 1991, she was interred in the same tomb. Her epitaph reads \"together again\". Juliet organized a trust for his work and donated much of his work to museums. Her plans to restore the studio as a public museum proved too expensive; such was the structure's disrepair. Most of the contents were stored at the Pompidou Center.\n\nIn 1974, Man Ray received the Royal Photographic Society's Progress Medal and Honorary Fellowship \"in recognition of any invention, research, publication or other contribution which has resulted in an important advance in the scientific or technological development of photography or imaging in the widest sense.\" In 1999, \"ARTnews\" magazine named Man Ray one of the 25 most influential artists of the 20th century. The publication cited his groundbreaking photography, \"his explorations of film, painting, sculpture, collage, assemblage and prototypes of what would eventually be called performance art and conceptual art.\" \"ARTnews\" further stated that \"Man Ray offered artists in all media an example of a creative intelligence that, in its 'pursuit of pleasure and liberty', unlocked every door it came to and walked freely where it would.\" Seeking pleasure and liberty was one of Ray's guiding principles, along with others such as doing things that are socially prohibited.\n\nIn March 2013, Man Ray's photograph \"Noire et Blanche\" (1926) was featured in the United States Postal Service's \"Modern Art in America\" series of stamps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

On its face side, the fibula shows an unidentified saint with a halo. It was found in a woman's grave of the beginning of the Christianization of northern Germany, and is in the permanent exhibition of the Archaeological Museum Hamburg in Harburg, Hamburg.\n\nThe cemetery was located on the western fringes of the ', an approximately mountain range which is running out on the ' some southeast of the village center of Maschen. During sand extraction from the Fuchsberg for the construction of the nearby Bundesautobahn 1, two Bronze Age tumuli were discovered in 1958. \n\nThe following excavations revealed that both grave mounds were disturbed to the undisturbed ground. Except for a few ceramic vessel shards and a razor from several later burials on the hill, no further findings were recorded. While pushing off the humuslayer north of the tumuli, the first late Saxon flat graves appeared in the ground. Additionally some soil discolorations appeared at a brim of the sand mine some east, indicating burial pits. During the initially launched rescue excavation, the complete burial site were excavated and documented in a three-week operation. It was the first fully documented late Saxon burial site of northern Germany so far with a total of 210 examined burials. \n\n21 burials were oriented in south-north direction and the majority of 189 burials were created in west-east orientation. The Maschen disc brooch was found in the grave No. 54 of a wealthy woman.\n\nThe Maschen disc brooch lay with its face side down on the woman's chest. The brooch has a diameter of and is made of different colored vitreous enamel in cloisonné technique on a copper plate. The copper base of the brooch is can shaped, and the enamel plate was fixed in the copper base on a bed of loam by flanging the protruding edges of the bases wall. The needle apparatus was not preserved. The remaining hinges indicate that it was a needle with a coil spring. Both the metal parts and enamel inlays are slightly worn. A radiological examination revealed that the enamel layer has a thickness of . The front face of the disc brooch depicts a stylized chest portrait on a now red background. The face and neck of the portrayed person are made of now greenish white enamel. Its eyes and nose region is formed by a curved bar made of copper, ending in two loops as stylized eyes. Around the head a kind of halo is shown, made of whitish to light blue enamel. The upper body has a semi-elliptical shape. The body is decorated by two widely arced copper bars from the neck towards the shoulders, which end there in small loops. The area around the neck of the figure is made of now light blue to turquoise enamel. The lower chest area, below the copper bars, is made of a now dark blue enamel.\n\nDue to its halo-like ornament around the head, the figure on the Maschen disc brooch is interpreted as an unspecified saint, and may possibly depict Jesus Christ. The addition of the fibula as a grave good indicates that the buried woman was an early Christian. She may have promised herself a salvation effect from the depicted figure, as the brooch was found placed with its face side on her chest. \n\nDue to the geographical orientation of the burial and its location within the cemetery, the burial has been dated to the period between 800 and 900 AD, which marks the beginning of the thorough Christianization of Northern Germany. \n\nSo far, some 100 comparison finds of fibulae of the Maschen disc brooch type were known, but they all came from stray finds or were collected from the surface without any assignment to a specific grave, and therefore a more precise dating of this type of brooches has been impossible before. \n\nBy the end of 2012 another nearly identical piece was found in a construction area at the Tostedt district of Todtglüsingen. The origin of this fibula is believed to be the Lower Rhine region and the noticeable accumulation of finds at the Niederelbe area may indicate that it has faced an increased popularity especially in this region.\n\n"}

Opened in 1883 and demolished in 1967, it was the first home of the Metropolitan Opera Company.\n\nSometimes referred to as \"the old Met\", the Metropolitan Opera House opened on October 22, 1883, with a performance of \"Faust\". It was located at 1411 Broadway, occupying the whole block between West 39th Street and West 40th Street on the west side of the street in the Garment District of Midtown Manhattan. Nicknamed \"The Yellow Brick Brewery\" for its industrial looking exterior, the original Metropolitan Opera House was designed by J. Cleaveland Cady. On August 27, 1892, the nine-year-old theater was gutted by fire. The 1892−93 season was canceled while the opera house was rebuilt along its original lines. During that season, the Vaudeville Club, which eventually became the Metropolitan Opera Club, was founded and hosted entertainment in the undamaged portions of the house.\n\nIn 1903, architects Carrère and Hastings extensively redesigned the interior of the opera house. The familiar golden auditorium with its sunburst chandelier, and curved proscenium inscribed with the names of six composers (Gluck, Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner, Gounod and Verdi), dates from this time. The first of the Met's signature gold damask stage curtains was installed in 1906, completing the look that the old Metropolitan Opera House maintained until its closing.\nIn 1940, ownership of the opera house shifted from the wealthy families who occupied the theater's boxes to the non-profit Metropolitan Opera Association. At this time the last major change to the auditorium's interior was completed. The second tier of privately held boxes (the \"grand tier\") was converted into standard row seating. This enlarged the seating capacity and left only the first tier of boxes from the \"golden horseshoe\" of the opera house's origins as a showplace for New York society.\n\nThe Met had a seating capacity of 3,625 with 224 standing room places.\n\nWhile the theater was noted for its excellent acoustics and elegant interior, as early as the 1900s the backstage facilities were deemed to be severely inadequate for a large opera company. Scenery and sets were a regular sight leaning against the building exterior on 39th Street where crews had to shift them between performances. Various plans were put forward over the years to build a new home for the company and designs for new opera houses were created by various architects including Joseph Urban. Proposed new locations included Columbus Circle and what is now Rockefeller Center, but none of these plans came to fruition. Only with the development of Lincoln Center on New York's Upper West Side did the Met finally have the opportunity to build a modern opera house.\n\nThe Metropolitan Opera said goodbye to its old house on April 16, 1966, with a sentimental gala farewell performance featuring nearly all of the company's current leading artists. Long-time Met star soprano Zinka Milanov made her last Met appearance that night, and among the many invited guests was soprano Anna Case, who had made her debut at the house in 1909. The final performance at the opera house was given not by the Met, but by the Bolshoi Ballet, which concluded a short run of appearances on May 8, 1966. The theater was purchased by Jack D. Weiler and despite a campaign to preserve the theater, it failed to obtain landmark status and the old Met was razed in 1967. It was replaced by a 40-story office tower, 1411 Broadway, intended to provide a steady income for the opera company. Designed by Irwin S. Chanin and completed in 1970, the building was later sold by the Metropolitan Opera and today it is owned by 1411 TrizecHahn-Swig LLC, a partnership of the TrizecHahn and Swig real estate companies. Since 1966, the Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center has been home to the Metropolitan Opera.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

The title is a reference to the \"Mona Lisa\", the famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci, and the song of the same name, originally performed by Nat King Cole, which was covered by Seal for the movie. Julia Roberts received a record $25 million for her performance, the highest ever earned by an actress at that time.\n\nIn 1953, Katherine Ann Watson (Julia Roberts), a 30-year-old graduate student in the department of Art History at UCLA and Oakland State, takes a position teaching \"History of Art\" at Wellesley College, a conservative women's private liberal arts college in Massachusetts. At her first class, Katherine discovers that her students have already memorized the entire textbook and syllabus, so she uses the classes to introduce them to Modern Art and encourages discussion about topics such as what makes good art. Katherine comes to know her students and seeks to inspire them to achieve more than marriage to eligible young men.\n\nBetty Warren (Kirsten Dunst) is highly opinionated and outspokenly conservative. Betty doesn't understand why Katherine is not married and insists that there is a universal standard for good art. She writes editorials for the college paper, exposing campus nurse Amanda Armstrong (Juliet Stevenson) as a supplier of contraception, which results in Amanda being fired; other editorial attack's Katherine for advocating that women should seek a career instead of being wives and mothers as intended. Betty can't wait to marry Spencer (Jordan Bridges) as their parents have arranged and expect the traditional exemptions from attending class as a married woman: Katherine insists she will be marked on merit and attendance, resulting in more conflict.\n\nConnie Baker (Ginnifer Goodwin) begins dating Betty's cousin, Charlie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) but Betty persuades her that he is only using her as his parents have arranged for him to marry Deb MacIntyre. Connie ends the relationship, believing Betty's story to be true. However, some weeks later, Connie and Charlie reconnect, with Charlie saying he has already decided for himself that he is not going to marry Deb, so he and Connie get back together.\n\nJoan Brandwyn (Julia Stiles) dreams of being a lawyer and has enrolled as pre-law, so Katherine encourages her to apply to Yale Law School. She is accepted, but decides not to go because she wants to start a life with her new husband Tommy (Topher Grace). She tells Katherine that choosing to be a wife and mother does not make her any less intelligent.\n\nGiselle Levy (Maggie Gyllenhaal) has several lovers and liberal views about sex. She admires Katherine for encouraging the students to be independent. Giselle earned the enmity of Betty, whose conservative views conflict with her liberal ones.\n\nKatherine declines a proposal from her California boyfriend (John Slattery) because she doesn't love him enough and begins seeing the Wellesley Italian professor, Bill Dunbar (Dominic West). Bill is charming and full of stories about Europe and his heroic actions in Italy during the war. He has also had affairs with students (including Giselle), and Katherine makes him promise that it will never happen again. The relationship progresses but when Katherine learns that Bill spent the entire war at the Army Languages Center on Long Island, she decides to break up with him because he is not trustworthy. Bill responds that Katherine didn't come to Wellesley to help the students find their way, but to help them find her way.\n\nWithin six months of the wedding Betty's marriage falls apart as Spencer has an affair and failing to find solace with her mother, she visits Katherine. Eventually, influenced by her, Betty files for divorce and looks for an apartment in Greenwich Village, Manhattan. When Mrs. Warren confronts Betty for what she's done, she reveals her frustration with her mother for not supporting her when she went to her for help when she found out about Spencer's affair and that the only person who cared about her was Katherine. Therefore, Betty reveals she's going to have a life of her own, has applied to Yale Law School and will room with Giselle.\n\nKatherine's course is highly popular, so the college invites her to return but with certain conditions: she must follow the syllabus, submit lesson plans for approval, keep a strictly professional relationship with all faculty members, and not talk to the girls about anything other than classes. Katherine decides to leave in order to explore Europe. In the final scene, Betty dedicates her last editorial to Katherine, claiming that her teacher is \"an extraordinary woman who lived by example and compelled us all to see the world through new eyes.\" As Katherine's taxi speeds up, all her students follow on their bicycles and Betty is seen struggling to keep up with the taxi as a last effort to thank Katherine for changing her life.\n\nIn its first opening weekend, \"Mona Lisa Smile\" opened at #2 at the U.S. Box office raking in $11,528,498 USD behind \"\". By the end of its run, while the film had grossed $141,337,989 worldwide, its U.S. domestic gross did not meet its $65 million budget, falling short at $63,860,942.\n\n\"Mona Lisa Smile\" received mixed to negative reviews from film critics. Critical aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes gives the movie a 34% \"rotten\" rating based on 153 reviews, and an average rating of 5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Though \"Mona Lisa Smile\" espouses the value of breaking barriers, the movie itself is predictable and safe.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nIn a typical review, Claudia Puig of \"USA Today\" wrote, \"it's \"Dead Poets Society\" as a chick flick, without the compelling drama and inspiration... even Roberts doesn't seem convinced. She gives a rather blah performance as if she's not fully committed to the role... Rather than being a fascinating exploration of a much more constrained time in our social history, the film simply feels anachronistic. The film deserves a solid 'C' for mediocrity and muted appeal.\" Critic Elizabeth M. Tamny of the \"Chicago Reader\" shared this negative assessment, writing \"Part of the problem is simply that \"Mona Lisa Smile\" is a Hollywood film, and Hollywood isn't good at depicting the life of the mind... And Julia Roberts is no help--you either like her or you don't, but either way it has little to do with talent. She's not so much an actor as a vessel for earnest reactions. The fact is... It's easier to take on an extremely black-and-white version of the most salient question from this film--can women bake their cake and eat it too?--than try to answer it in the present.\"\n\nIn a message to Wellesley alumnae concerning the film, Wellesley College president Diana Chapman Walsh expressed regret, given that many alumnae from the 1950s felt that the film's portrayal of Wellesley was inaccurate.\n\nDuring the filming of \"Mona Lisa Smile\", the Wellesley College campus broke into controversy surrounding the casting of student extras with use of the phrase \"not too tan\" in a casting call for current Wellesley students, sparking a fear that casting directors were using race to discriminate against potential extras. Producers claimed that they were merely stressing the importance of finding women that reflected the time period.\n\nThe controversy spilled over into the local media, and producers considered a compromise of hiring willing minority students to act as production assistants. The college issued a press release highlighting the realities of Wellesley in 1953 and defending their decision to allow the film to shoot on campus.\n\n"}

Structures like these constituted the government stronghold in some of the older (pre-Islamic) towns of central Iran. Some of these castles incorporate mud bricks of the Medes period and of the Achaemenid and Sassanid dynasties.\n\nThe ruins of the structure stands 40 meters (130 ft) high from its base. Although built some 2,000 years ago, it contains what seems to be a type of plumbing system (made out of a kind of mortar called \"sarooj\") which was built into its massive walls. It is also peculiarly similar in design to \"Ali Qapu\" palace of Isfahan; it has a terrace high on top of the structure whose circulation is provided by two helical stairwells (whose walls have caved in, making it inaccessible). The structure also has a large underground chamber (filled now by rubble), possibly a prison. Four towers surround the entire compound, and a large gate furnishes access to a large courtyard. The structure seems to have been the victim of numerous earthquakes throughout the ages.\n\nSome believe that the Narin castles are descendants of ancient fire-temples; some of the castles in Narin and Meybod, in Yazd province, are also called \"nareng\" castles (orange castles), possibly by folk etymology. The castle at Meybod is currently under study. Yet this castle has not been faring very well.\n\nUnfortunately today, the ruins of Narin Gahl'eh is nothing more but the site of a local garbage dump, and what is even more depressing is that Iran contains thousands of such structures, decaying in their own rubble.\n\nAlthough there are some bricks from Medes period, there are rumors that this castle was built around 7000 years ago, this building ( city) unlike all other buildings ( for exp.: Susa) has built as an old city in 3 different floors, at ground level you will see common people life form, then commercial and business part and then royal part (except the military part on the roof for patrolling and watching far distances in case of military invasion. ( No religious floor or section at all!)\n\nThe position of this city is unlike all others as you can watch over 70 kilometers in every direction from the top of the roof,yet again it is centered between mountains so for an invasion you had to climb those mountains first then go another 70 kilometers and only after that you had to prepare yourself for all other normal events when you wanted to invade a castle (like rivers of water and burning oil, etc.)\n\nAlthough all outer gates have been destroyed the inner castle still exists. You can still see some of the outer walls.\n\n"}

Historian Eve Ma notes that the \"Oakland Asian Cultural Center\" started in December 1984 as the East Bay Chinese Culture Center. In 1987, as it began acquiring help from the city government and recognizing that Chinatown's composition had changed, the Center changed its name, broadening its aim to include all Asian cultures.\"\n\nSince opening its own facility in 1996 Oakland’s Chinatown district, the OACC has offered cultural programs including performances, workshops, festivals, school tours, classes, and exhibitions.\n\nThe OACC has educational programming and cultural activities for residents of Oakland Chinatown. Community groups and artists hold weekly classes in dance, martial arts, art, history, and language at the center. The activities offered at the center range from traditions that span across the world, including Japanese flower arrangement, Theravada Buddhist meditation, Chinese Gong Fu and Mongolian traditional dance.\n\nThe space has an auditorium with a stage, conference rooms, dance studio, lobby, and kitchen that serve as ongoing and one-time resources for local nonprofit organizations, schools, government agencies, Fortune 500 companies, and individuals. The auditorium is named after Edward W. Chin. Chin donated $250,000 towards the completion of the center's auditorium, a space that is used for major events.\n\nIn the past, the OACC hosted events featuring traditional and contemporary Asian arts, music, and dance with family-friendly activities and vendors such as the Harvest Moon Festival Celebration and Elements of Rhythm: Drums of Asia. Recurring events include the Lunar New Year Celebration, Asian Heritage Street Celebration, and OACC Gala. It also hosted a Larry Itliong Day in honor of the titular labor union leader, as well as an anniversary public screening of the first Asian American film, The Curse of Quon Gwon.\n\nOACC has free exhibitions. Its exhibitions stem from traditional and contemporary culture from all over the world. The cultural center’s past exhibitions include Reflections: Vietnam Through the Eyes of Vietnamese Americans, Oakland Chinatown Oral History Project, Calligraphies in Conversation, Asians 4 Black Lives, Epekto Arts, and Drums of Asia.\n\nOne of its most recognized exhibitions is the Oakland Chinatown Oral History Project, which was started by Oakland Chinatown's Community Advisory Committee in 2005.

{"id": "29866276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29866276", "title": "Relationship between avant-garde art and American pop culture", "text": "Relationship between avant-garde art and American pop culture\n\nAvant-garde art and American pop culture have had an intriguing relationship from the time of the art form's inception in America to the current day. The art form, which began in the early half of the nineteenth century in Europe, started to rise slowly in America under the guise of Dadaism in 1915. While originally formed under a group of artists in New York City who wanted to counter pop culture with their art, music, and literature the art form began to grow into prominence with American pop culture due to a variety of factors between the 1940s to the 1970s. However, from many factors that arose in the late 1970s, avant-garde began to both lessen in prominence and began to blend with the pop culture to the point in which most art critics considered the art form extinct.\n\nThough his first published essays dealt mainly with literature and theatre, art still held a powerful attraction for Clement Greenberg, so in 1939, he made a sudden name as a visual art writer with possibly his most well-known and oft-quoted essay, \"Avant-Garde and Kitsch\", first published in the journal \"Partisan Review\". In this Marxist-influenced essay, Greenberg claimed that true avant-garde art is a product of the Enlightenment's revolution of critical thinking, and as such resists and recoils from the degradation of culture in both mainstream capitalist and communist society, while acknowledging the paradox that, at the same time, the artist, dependent on the market or the state, remains inexorably attached \"by an umbilical cord of gold\". Kitsch, on the other hand, was the product of industrialization and the urbanization of the working class, a filler made for the consumption of the working class: a populace hungry for culture, but without the resources and education to enjoy cutting edge avant garde culture. Greenberg writes,\n\n\"Kitsch, using for raw material the debased and academicized simulacra of genuine culture, welcomes and cultivates this insensibility. It is the source of its profits. Kitsch is mechanical and operates by formulas. Kitsch is vicarious experience and faked sensations. Kitsch changes according to style, but remains always the same. Kitsch is the epitome of all that is spurious in the life of our times. Kitsch pretends to demand nothing of its customers except their money – not even their time.\" \n\nFor Greenberg, avant garde art was too \"innocent\" to be effectively used as propaganda or bent to a cause, while kitsch was ideal for stirring up false sentiment.\n\nGreenberg appropriated the German word \"kitsch\" to describe this low, concocted form of \"culture\", though its connotations have since been recast to a more affirmative acceptance of nostalgic materials of capitalist/communist culture. \"Avant Garde and Kitsch\" is clearly a politically motivated essay, in part a response to the destruction and repression of Modernist Art in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, and represents a denouncement of the growing totalitarian threat in Europe and the \"retrogression\" of fascism.\n\nAvant-garde, as sociologist Diana Crane states, “was an art-form that had started in Europe that had started in the early nineteenth century.” While the art form has survived for this long, she states that the concept of the art form is “highly ambiguous” and it has been through many phases throughout its existence, including Dadaism, Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism, and pop art. Socially, however, each form of avant-garde is united with the idea that it is part of the definition of high culture, although this in itself is defined in a variety of fashions.\n\nDue to the ambiguity of the term, Crane gives a few considerations on what could be considered avant-garde and what is not. She states that avant-garde can be determined in its approach to the aesthetic, through the social content of the artwork, and through the production and distribution of the artwork.\n\nThrough aesthetic, a piece of artwork can be determined avant-garde if it does any of the following:\n\nAn example of the aesthetic used in Avant-garde can include the artwork of Marcel Duchamp. For Duchamp's \"Fountain\", he simply took a urinal and defined this as a ready-made art form. In this, he redefined artistic conventions by taking an item that was already made and employing the item for an artistic purpose. By doing this, he also employed a new technique in the production of art by taking something that was already produced and redefined the object he was using by taking a urinal and using it for art.\n\nThrough social content, a piece of artwork can be determined avant-garde if it does one of the following:\n\nThrough its production and distribution, an artwork can be described as avant-garde if it redefines the social context for the production of art, in terms of critics, role models, and the audience; if it does one of the following:\n\n\nWhile the two terms are used interchangeably today, some argue that the difference between the two lie in their approach to innovating art. According to Jochen Schulte-Sasse, the two differ in the fact that Post-modernism wants to destroy old conceptions of art to replace them with new (without any reference to the social impact of the art). According to Diana Crane, post-modernists do this through a variety of ways, namely through creating effects of polysemy, ambiguity, and parody. Post-modernists also only focused on the technique of their art rather than the social impacts of their art. However, avant-garde wants to innovate art and also communicate social issues within it. It could also be defined that post-modernism uses their art with the intent to shock the person viewing the art while avant-garde, while it also often shocks the viewer, uses their art to communicate a message through the art while also using the art to shock the viewer.\n\nWhile avant-garde is a solitary art form, it has had a variety of subgenres attached to the art form throughout its history, with each communicating their own distinct messages. Some of them, like Dadaism and Pop Art, use the art to provide a social commentary. Others, like Abstract Expressionism, use outer-worldly figures and colors to evoke an emotional response. Finally, there are some like Minimalism which use their art for the sake of making art without any emotional or social meanings behind them. While there are myriad different avant-garde subgenres that came about during its popularity in America, the four subgenres that played the biggest roles in American Popular Culture are Dadaism, Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism, and Pop Art.\n\nDadaism was the first major subgenre of avant-garde art to cross over into America. Dadaist artists, in many ways, wanted to contrast from the typical artist at the time from their idea of being against typical artistic conventions at the time and being anti-art. A good example of their anti-art approach came through what Dadaists call the “ready-mades,” the most notable being Marcel Duchamp's Fountain, which was a porcelain urinal. Ready-mades such as this caused great debate in the art community concerning the definition of art and how Dadaists should play in this definition.\n\nWhile Dadaist pieces cannot be determined through a particular artistic form, many Dadaist artists collaborated in groups with each other in order to create their art, united on either to create art based on social issues (particularly in Europe) or to mock the art world in general (mostly in America). In America, the center of this movement came from two locations in the New York-area: at Alfred Stieglitz’s New York gallery “291,” and at the studio of Walter Arensberg. In addition to group collaboration, artists of the Dada movement depended more on spontaneity and chance than following other established artists. They focused on rejecting the ideas formed by established artists and art creation and used methods such as collage, photomontage, and found-object construction to create their art. While this art form started strong in 1916 in Germany, it eventually faded out by 1922 in both Europe and America. However, despite its decline, Dada would play a major influence on other avant-garde and nihilistic art-forms in the future, including the Punk movement in the '1970s.\n\nAbstract Expressionism was another major avant-garde genre that, unlike Dadaism, was born in and popular in the United States. A number of artists that were practitioners of this art form include Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, and Mark Rothko. Much like Dadaism in America, the center of the movement was in New York City.\n\nAlso, much like Dadaism, although many of the artists worked together in creating their art, the art pieces cannot be determined through one particular art form. Pieces often varied differently between painting styles from both the techniques that were used in the piece and quality of expression of the pieces. Despite the drastic differences between pieces, Abstract Expressionism shares several broad characteristics. These characteristics includes:\n\n\nThere are also three main techniques in which categorize Abstract Expressionism. First, there is Action Painting, which is characterized by a loose, rapid, dynamic, or forceful handling of paint in sweeping or slashing brush strokes and in techniques partially dictated by chance, such as dripping or spilling the paint directly onto the canvas. Examples of this include Jackson Pollock dripping commercial paints on raw canvas to build up complex and tangled skeins of paint into exciting and suggestive linear patterns and Willem de Kooning used extremely vigorous and expressive brush strokes to build up richly colored and textured images. The second category of Abstract Expressionism is represented by a variety of styles ranging from Color field, to Lyrical abstraction; delicate imagery and fluid shapes and fields of color included in works by Clyfford Still, Philip Guston, and Helen Frankenthaler to the more clearly structured, forceful, almost calligraphic pictures of Robert Motherwell and Adolph Gottlieb. Finally, the last form of Abstract Expressionism is the third and least emotionally expressive approach was that of Rothko, Barnett Newman, and Ad Reinhardt. These painters used large areas, or fields, of flat colour and thin, diaphanous paint to achieve quiet, subtle, almost meditative effects. While Abstract Expressionism's roots could be traced back as far as 1919, the peak of its popularity were in the 1950s to the 1960s. This, like Dadaism before, shows another influential avant-grade artistic genre that suffered from a short peak of popularity.\n\nMinimalism was an avant-grade genre from the 1910s to the late 1960s which was characterized by extreme simplicity of a form and a literal approach. Its origins could be stemmed from many artists, including Kandinsky, Picabia, Delaunay, Kupka, Survage and Malevich, who focused on reducing art to its basic element. A great example of his art was the painting of a black square on a white ground. Other minimalist artists that were famous at this time included painters such as Jack Youngerman, Ellsworth Kelly, Frank Stella, Kenneth Noland, Al Held, and Gene Davis and sculptors such as Donald Judd, Carl Andre, Dan Flavin, Tony Smith, Anthony Caro, and Sol LeWitt. \n\nIn many ways the rise of Minimalism came as a result of those who were dissatisfied with the Abstract Expressionist movement, primarily from the Action Paintings of the movement. The reason for many was that they believed that Action painting was too personal and insubstantial, and they adopted the point of view that a work of art should not refer to anything other than itself.\n\nUnlike other genres of avant-garde at the time, minimalist art used not only a set of philosophical properties when it came to the production of their In order to rid their art of any extra-visual influence, Minimalist paintings used hard edge painting, a simplistic form, and a linear approach to emphasize two-dimensionality and to allow the viewer an immediate, purely visual response to art in comparison to any other sort of response.\n\nHard-edge painting is characterized by large, simplified, usually geometric forms on an overall flat surface; precise, razor-sharp contours; and broad areas of bright, unmodulated color that have been stained into unprimed canvas. It differs from other types of geometric abstraction in that it rejects both lyrical and mathematical composition because, even in this simplified field, they are a means of personal expression for the artist. Minimal hard-edge painting is the anonymous construction of a simple object. (Make a reference to the part of the encyclopedia entry that this came from)\n\nMuch like minimalist painting, minimalist sculpture used extremely simple, monumental geometric forms made of fiberglass, plastic, sheet metal, or aluminum, either left raw or solidly painted with bright industrial color in order to convey the art for the usage of the visual response without allowing the art to create responses elsewhere. An example of Minimalist Sculpture is “Free Ride” by Tony Smith, which is a black geometrical structure the size of a door opening on a white background.\n\nOne of the last major avant-garde artforms that proved to be very influential to the American pop culture was Pop Art. This art form had much of its roots in Great Britain in the early 1950s, but made its way into the American culture by the late 1950s and remained a popular art form in America from the 1960s. Some of the famous practitioners of this era include Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, and Claes Oldenburg.\n\nPop art, also like minimalism, has clear commonalities between their pieces. Primarily, each piece uses commonplace items (comic strips, soup cans, road signs, and hamburgers) as the subject matter of their pieces. They emphatically present any iconography that has created a major impact on contemporary life without praise or condemnation but with overwhelming immediacy, and by means of the precise commercial techniques used by the media from which the iconography itself was borrowed. It was also an attempt to return to a more objective, universally acceptable form of art after the dominance in both the United States and Europe of the highly personal Abstract Expressionism. It was also iconoclastic, rejecting both the supremacy of the “high art” of the past and the pretensions of other contemporary avant-garde art. Pop art became a cultural event because of its close reflection of a particular social situation and because its easily comprehensible images were immediately exploited by the mass media. Despite its opposition to other avant-garde art forms at its time, Pop art was a derivative of Dada, especially praising the art of Marcel Duchamp, who with his “ready-mades” also praised many objects and imagery of American pop culture.\n\nBefore World War II there were some significant artists and art movements in the United States, but, according to sociologist Diana Crane, these art movements never were directly inspired by art movements from Europe. However, due to the numbers of immigrants from Europe who were involved with the avant-garde movement in Europe, Dadaist artists from Europe like Marcel Duchamp moved to America carrying their avant-garde ideals with them. Once they arrived in New York City, many of these Dadaists decided to collaborate, making art to display to the public.\n\nInitially, while the Dadaists brought some attention to the New York art scene, they had very little attention outside of it. Some factors that played to the lack of attention of the Dadaists at the time included the lack of museums throughout the United States and the lack of funding to the artists who created and advertised the art.\n\nAccording to Peter Burger, some of the theories involving aesthetics can come all the way back to the writings of Karl Marx. According to Burger, “ For Marx, this development is not merely one in economic theory. Rather, he feels that the possibility of a progress in knowledge is a function of the development of the object toward which insight directs itself... Marx demonstrates through the example of the category of labor also applies to objectifications in the arts... it is only with aestheticism that the full unfolding of the phenomenon of art became a fact, and it is to aestheticism that the historical avant-garde movements respond” \n\nBesides from the idea of Karl Marx's influence over the avant-garde movement, much of the movement came through social commentary from the wars that were fought during the time of its rise. Dadaism, for instance, was seized upon by the group as appropriate for their anti-aesthetic creations and protest activities, which were engendered by disgust for bourgeois values and despair over World War I. Another example of this is John Hartfield's usage of photomontage to express his anti-Nazi views.\n\nAs previously stated, as soon as many of the Dadaist movement from Europe immigrated over to the United States in the 1920s, they started making their art and presenting the art to the people of New York. Although it didn't initially take off, by the 1950s, their art and the art from artists that were inspired by these individuals began to rise in popularity.\n\nThere were a number of factors that lead to the rise of avant-garde art in the eyes of the American Popular Culture. First of all, due to the rise of the American Economy after World War II, the American Government focused on enhancing the importance of the Fine Arts. To do so, congress passed bills in which expanded the number of museums around the nation and funded the government to allow the artists to produce more art.\n\nBefore the 1940s, Americans in many regions were unaware to the existence of avant-garde art because, according to Dore Ashton, “Although culture... had penetrated the hinterland in the form of public libraries, literary societies, and even music circles, the plastic arts had... lagged far behind” In order to increase the interest of the arts among the people and to allow them to be up-to-date with the rest of the world at that time, they decided to increase the number of museums in America from the 1940s to the 1980s.\n\nAlong with the construction of museums, the Federal Government also realized that, to increase the interest of the people, there needed to be more art available. In addition to this, if the artists were to do so, they would need to form communities in which the artists could gather to produce their art. According to Sharon Zukin, “...real-estate developers profited from the increase in property values that resulted from the creation of an artistic community in Manhattan's SoHo district while political leaders benefited from the creation of a large pool of arts-related jobs.” Another reason the Federal Government felt a need to fund the artists at this time was to increase the patriotism of the people. If there was art depicting how grand, majestic, and free the United States of America is, they felt this would increase Patriotism among the people so the people would be willing to agree with whatever the government had to offer. According to Sharon Zukin, “The willingness of federal and state governments to fund art and artists were political interests that used traveling exhibitions as propaganda for the American way of life.\n\nWhen looking at all of the major movements of avant-garde that were influential from this time period, almost all of these art forms trace back to earlier avant-garde art forms, namely Dadaism. For instance, in practice, Abstract Expressionism was influenced by Dada by the fact that the art form had its similarities not in the way that the art was constructed, but rather from the concept that the genres exemplify. Pop Art also marks its influences from Dada because, like the “ready-mades” which used commonplace items in a way that they were not originally intended. For the case of Dada, the “ready-mades” consisted of items such as toilets as art. For the case of pop art, it could have been anything that proved influential in popular culture, whether it be comic strips, soup cans, or magazine advertisements.\n\nAnother example of how an earlier avant-garde genre influenced a later genre was the example of Dada's influence of Punk fashion in the 1970s. Much like how the Dadaists used their art to reflect the ideal of the belief in nothing and the wish to become nothing through their art (as they often referred it as anti-art), the Punk culture used the same ideals for their fashion and their music (by describing their music as anti-music). In addition to the two matching the same ideal, both used their mediums to reflect the same approach: to shock the community through their art and to speak a political, often Marxist, message through their works.\n\nStemming from its Dadaist beginnings, avant-garde was a movement that served as a contrast from typical Popular Culture. Under the guise of Dada, it started in Europe as a way to display their anti-art rhetoric as well as to communicate to the public their disgust for bourgeois values and their disapproval of World War I. In America, while the art was not much about protesting bourgeois values and the war, it still served as a way to protest against typical art values as well as to establish the high, artistic culture to contrast American popular culture.\n\nSimilarly, Abstract Expressionist and Minimalist art also served as a way to contrast popular culture. In Abstract Expressionist art, the approach to contrast from the depiction of real-world qualities by creating art using forms that do not exist in the real world. In Minimalist art, the approach was to contrast from the complicated works of the time, including those of fellow avant-garde genre Abstract Expressionism. Through this, the artist created their art with the sole intent of making art; not with a complicated political statement, not with a cultural reference, etc. It solely was art for art itself.\n\nHowever, Pop art and its practitioners, while continuing to do some contrast between high culture and popular culture, began to blur the two by using elements of popular culture and transforming those images in a way which were not the original intent of those elements, much like the ready-mades of the Dadaist artists before them. It sometimes came through subverting the images coloration, such as what Andy Warhol did with pictures of soup cans and actress Marilyn Monroe. In other times, it came through taking a comic strip out of its initial context and using that for a piece. However, despite trying to contrast the two, at many times many of the artists became celebrities in popular culture while practicing their contrast between that and the High Culture.\n\nAfter the end of the Pop Art movement, many art critics began to question the rising generation of artists who were influenced by the Pop artists shortly before, even to the point that some considered avant-garde dead. There are various reasons, but three primary indications for its demise are:\n\n\n\n"}

The campaign had started in December 2005, probably with putting up flyers by unknown activists in Kirovohrad. After publicity this idea had been taken by other social and political organizations. Active actions were being continued in this campaign mainly in the gas conflict of 2005–2006 and 2008–2009 between Ukraine and the Russian Federation.\n\nDecember 2005, unknown activists in Kirovohrad handed around leaflets with the words \"\"Remember about the gas\", \"Do not buy Russian goods\"\" and the image of Gas pipe at the height of the Gas conflict between Russia and Ukraine. News about it was published by online newspaper \"Ves' Kirovohrad\". On December 22, and the next few days the news had been reposted by several publications. On December 22 the news appeared on the website \"Maidan\" by activists of Alliance \"Maidan\". On the December 23 the news with calling for a boycott of Russian goods, printing, distributing leaflets, and stickers, sending messages and emails from E-mail with such appeals had been appeared on website \"Maidan\". According to activists, on December 24, the news had been reporting Ukrainian news sites and later Russian, then the campaign had gained publicity a popularity.\n\nOn 4 January 2006, in Rivne social movement \"Pure Ukraine\" and the party People's Union \"Our Ukraine\" presented nationwide initiative \"Blackmail no! Independence yes!\" Among other things, the launch of the first nationwide boycott of Russian goods was announced at a press conference.\n\nOn 4 January 2006, in Kiev on Khreschatyk street activists held the first event calling not buy Russian. Young people was supported by singer Maria Burmaka.\n\nIn early January 2006, \"Ukrainian National Assembly\" called for a boycott of Russian goods.\n\nOn 1 January 2009, Russian Federation had stopped supplying natural gas to Ukraine's during the new Ukrainian-Russian gas conflict. Gas transit pipeline was completely blocked. That same evening, activists of the Alliance \"Maidan\" spread through the Internet call for a boycott of Russian goods, recalling the experience of the campaign in 2005-2006. Actions of the Russian authorities to Ukraine gas were called racketeering: \"\"Once more in the early days of the New Year Moscow and its \"Gazprom\" started gas racket against Ukraine. But every Ukrainian has also leverage on an aggressive neighbor, NOT CONSUME ITS OUTPUT!\"\"\n\nIn January 2009, the idea was picked up by several social media. In particular, it was called to a boycott of Russian goods during the action against Russia's policy towards Ukraine in Kiev and Lviv.\n\nIn December 2005, former Rada Chairman Volodymyr Lytvyn said he would not send his friends any SMS with the text \"Remember about the Gas Do not buy Russian goods\", because he believes that it will increase the ethnic strife.\n\nIn 2006, scientists of the Institute of State and Law of the National Academy of Sciences Ukraine expressed that the campaign resulted in strengthening agitation Party of Regions and Viktor Yanukovych during the election campaign in 2006 parliamentary elections to the introduction of Russian as a second language in Ukraine, and for closer integration of Ukraine with Russia within the Common Economic Space.\n\nAfter putting up flyers in Kirovohrad by unknown activists, several grocery stores stopped to do orders of Russian chocolate and beer \"Baltika\".\n\nAccording to activists in early 2006 Spiritual Directorate of Buddhists Ukraine \"Ninhma in Ukraine\" supported its decision to boycott Russian goods. On their website they allegedly hung a banner \"Do not buy Russian goods!\"\n\nAccording to historian Yaroslav Svatko he expressed in February 2006, the campaign was unexpected for the Russian government and led to unexpected consequences for her spontaneous, decentralized distribution in society the idea of separation of Ukrainian interests of Russia.\n\nFrom the beginning of the campaign name came from the phrase \"Remember about the gas\" and \"do not buy Russian goods\" probably with leaflets those were handed by unknown activists in Kirovohrad. It was used by the activists of Alliance \"Maidan\" as \"Remember the gasdo not buy Russian goods!\" In that form phrase was most particularly through the media. But also phrase \"Remember the gas do not buy Russian goods\" (without the exclamation mark) was widely used. In 2009, the option \"Remember the gas! Do not buy Russian goods!\" It was also used as well as other derivative forms.\n\nIn August 2013, public campaign with similar name and concept was emerged in response to export blockade of Ukraine by Russia. It also got wide publicity and distribution in Ukraine, called \"Do not buy Russian goods!\" Later one more campaign was appeared \"Boycott Russian Films\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2074481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2074481", "title": "Rosalind E. Krauss", "text": "Rosalind E. Krauss\n\nRosalind Epstein Krauss (born November 30, 1941) is an American art critic, art theorist and a professor at Columbia University in New York City. Krauss is known for her scholarship in 20th-century painting, sculpture and photography. As a critic and theorist she has published steadily since 1965 in \"Artforum,\" \"Art International\" and \"Art in America\". She was associate editor of \"Artforum\" from 1971 to 1974 and has been editor of \"October\", a journal of contemporary arts criticism and theory that she co-founded in 1976.\n\nKrauss was born to Matthew M. Epstein and Bertha Luber in Washington D.C. and grew up in the area, visiting art museums with her father. After graduating from Wellesley in 1962, she attended Harvard, whose Department of Fine Arts (now Department of History of Art and Architecture) had a strong tradition of the intensive analysis of actual art objects under the aegis of the Fogg Museum.\n\nKrauss wrote her dissertation on the work of David Smith. Krauss received her Ph.D. in 1969. The dissertation was published as \"Terminal Iron Works\" in 1971.\n\nIn the late-1960s and early-1970s Krauss began to contribute articles to art journals such as \"Art International\" and \"Artforum\" — which, under the editorship of Philip Leider, was relocated from California to New York. She began by writing the \"Boston Letter\" for \"Art International,\" but soon published well-received articles on Jasper Johns (\"Lugano Review\", 1965) and Donald Judd (\"Allusion and Illusion in Donald Judd,\" \"Artforum\", May 1966). Her commitment to the emerging minimal art in particular set her apart from Michael Fried, who was oriented toward the continuation of modernist abstraction in Jules Olitski, Kenneth Noland and Anthony Caro. Krauss's article \"A View of Modernism\" (\"Artforum\", September 1972), was one signal of this break.\n\nKrauss became dissatisfied with \"Artforum\" when in its November 1974 issue it published a full-page advertisement by featuring the artist Lynda Benglis aggressively posed with a large latex dildo and wearing only a pair of sunglasses promoting an upcoming exhibition of hers at the Paula Cooper Gallery. Although Benglis' image is now popularly cited as an important example of gender performativity in contemporary art, it provoked mixed responses when it first appeared. Krauss and other Artforum personnel attacked Benglis' work in the following month's issue of \"Artforum\", describing the advertisement as exploitative and brutalizing, and soon left the magazine to co-found \"October\" in 1976.\n\n\"October\" was formed as a politically-charged journal that introduced American readers to the ideas of French post-structuralism, made popular by Michel Foucault and Roland Barthes. Krauss used \"October\" as a way of publishing essays on post-structuralist art theory, Deconstructionist theory, psychoanalysis, postmodernism and feminism.\n\nThe founders included Krauss, Annette Michelson and the artist Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe. Krauss was appointed as its founding editor. Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe withdrew after only a few issues, and by the spring of 1977, Douglas Crimp joined the editorial team. In 1990, after Crimp left the journal, Krauss and Michelson were joined by Yve-Alain Bois, Hal Foster, Benjamin H. D. Buchloh, Denis Hollier, and John Rajchman.\n\nKrauss taught at Wellesley, MIT and Princeton before joining the faculty at Hunter College in 1974. She was promoted to professor in 1977 at Hunter and was also appointed professor at the Graduate Center of CUNY. She held the title of Distinguished Professor at Hunter until she left to join the Columbia University faculty in 1992. In 1985, a monograph of essays by Krauss, titled \"The Originality of the Avant-Garde and Other Modernist Myths\" was published by The MIT Press.\n\nPreviously Meyer Schapiro Professor of Modern Art and Theory at Columbia, in 2005 Rosalind Krauss was promoted to the highest faculty rank of University Professor. She has received fellowships from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts and has been a fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts and of the Institute for Advanced Study. She received the Frank Jewett Mather Award for criticism from the College Art Association in 1973. She has been a fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities since 1992 and was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1994. She recently received an honorary doctorate from the University of London.\n\nKrauss has been curator of many art exhibitions at leading museums, among them exhibitions on Joan Miró at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (1970–73), on surrealism and photography at the Corcoran Museum of Art (1982–85), on Richard Serra at the Museum of Modern Art (1985–86), and on Robert Morris at the Guggenheim (1992–94). She prepared an exhibition for the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris called \"Formlessness: Modernism Against the Grain\" in 1996.\n\nKrauss's attempts to understand the phenomenon of modernist art, in its historical, theoretical, and formal dimensions, have led her in various directions. She has, for example, been interested in the development of photography, whose history – running parallel to that of modernist painting and sculpture – makes visible certain previously overlooked phenomena in the \"high arts\", such as the role of the indexical mark, or the function of the archive. She has also investigated certain concepts, such as \"formlessness\", \"the optical unconscious\", or \"pastiche\", which organize modernist practice in relation to different explanatory grids from those of progressive modernism, or the avant-garde.\n\nLike many, Krauss had been drawn to the criticism of Clement Greenberg, as a counterweight to the highly subjective, poetic approach of Harold Rosenberg. The poet-critic model proved long-lasting in the New York scene, with products from Frank O'Hara to Kynaston McShine to Peter Schjeldahl, but for Krauss and others, its basis in subjective expression was fatally unable to account for how a particular artwork's objective structure gives rise to its associated subjective effects.\n\nGreenberg's way of assessing how an art object works, or how it is put together, became for Krauss a fruitful resource; even if she and fellow \"Greenberger\", Michael Fried, would break first with the older critic, and then with each other, at particular moments of judgment, the commitment to formal analysis as the necessary if not sufficient ground of serious criticism would still remain for both of them. Decades after her first engagement with Greenberg, Krauss still used his ideas about an artwork's 'medium' as a jumping-off point for her strongest effort to come to terms with post-1980 art in the person of William Kentridge. Krauss would formulate this formalist commitment in strong terms, against attempts to account for powerful artworks in terms of residual ideas about an artist's individual genius, for instance in the essays \"The Originality of the Avant-Garde: A Postmodernist Repetition\" and \"Photography's Discursive Spaces.\" For Krauss, and for the school of critics who developed under her influence, the Greenbergian legacy offers at its best a way of accounting for works of art using public and hence verifiable criteria.\n\nWhether about (Cubist collage, Surrealist photography, early Giacometti sculpture, Rodin, Brâncuși, Pollock) or about art contemporaneous to her own writing (Robert Morris, Sol LeWitt, Richard Serra, Cindy Sherman), Krauss translates the ephemeralities of visual and bodily experience into precise, vivid English, which has solidified her prestige as a critic. Her usual practice is to make this experience intelligible by using categories translated from the work of a thinker outside the study of art, such as Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Ferdinand de Saussure, Jacques Lacan, Jean-François Lyotard, Jacques Derrida, Georges Bataille, or Roland Barthes. Indeed, she participated in the translation of Lacan's key text \"Television\" which was published in October and later reissued in book form by Norton. Her work has helped establish the position of these writers within the study of art, even at the cost of provoking anxiety about threats to the discipline's autonomy. She is currently preparing a second volume of collected essays as a sequel to \"The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths\" (1986).\n\nIn many cases, Krauss is credited as a leader in bringing these concepts to bear on the study of modern art. For instance, her \"Passages in Modern Sculpture\" (1977) makes important use of Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology (as she had come to understand it in thinking about minimal art) for viewing modern sculpture in general. In her study of Surrealist photography, she rejected William Rubin's efforts at formal categorization as insufficient, instead advocating the psychoanalytic categories of \"dream\" and \"automatism\", as well as Jacques Derrida's \"grammatological\" idea of \"spacing.\" See \"The Photographic Conditions of Surrealism\" (\"October\", winter 1981).\n\nConcerning Cubist art, she took Picasso's collage breakthrough to be explicable in terms of Saussure's ideas about the differential relations and non-referentiality of language, rejecting efforts by other scholars to tie the pasted newspaper clippings to social history. Similarly, she held Picasso's stylistic developments in Cubist portraiture to be products of theoretical problems internal to art, rather than outcomes of the artist's love life. Later, she explained Picasso's participation in the \"rappel à l'ordre\" or return to order of the 1920s in similar structuralist terms. See \"In the Name of Picasso\" (\"October\", spring 1981), \"The Motivation of the Sign\" (in Lynn Zelevansky, ed., \"Picasso and Braque: A Symposium\", 1992), and \"The Picasso Papers\" (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1998).\n\nFrom the 1980s, she became increasingly concerned with using a psychoanalytic understanding of drives and the unconscious, owing less to the Freudianism of an André Breton or a Salvador Dalí, and much more to the structuralist Lacan and the \"dissident surrealist\" Bataille. See \"No More Play\", her 1984 essay on Giacometti, as well as \"Corpus Delicti\", written for the 1985 exhibition \"L'Amour Fou: Photography and Surrealism\", \"Cindy Sherman: 1975–1993\" and \"The Optical Unconscious\" (both 1993) and \"Formless: A User's Guide\" with Yve-Alain Bois, catalog to the exhibition \"L'Informe: Mode d'emploi\" (Paris: Centre Pompidou, 1996).\n\nYears after her time at \"Artforum\" in the 1960s, Krauss also returned to the drip painting of Jackson Pollock as both a culmination of modernist work within the format of the \"easel picture\", and a breakthrough that opened the way for several important developments in later art, from Allan Kaprow's happenings to Richard Serra's lead-flinging process art to Andy Warhol's oxidation (i.e. urination) paintings. For reference, see the Pollock chapter in \"The Optical Unconscious,\" several entries in the \"Formless\" catalog, and \"Beyond the Easel Picture\", her contribution to the MoMA symposium accompanying the 1998 Pollock retrospective (\"Jackson Pollock: New Approaches\"). This direction provided intellectual validation for the explosive Pollock markets; but it exacerbated already tense relations between herself and more radical currents in visual/cultural studies, the latter growing steadily impatient with the traditional western art-historical canon.\n\nIn addition to writing focused studies about individual artists, Krauss also produced broader, synthetic studies that helped gather together and define the limits of particular fields of practice. Examples of this include \"Sense and Sensibility: Reflections on Post '60s Sculpture\" (\"Artforum\", Nov. 1973), \"Video: The Aesthetics of Narcissism\" (\"October\", spring 1976), \"Notes on the Index: Seventies Art in America\", in two parts, \"October\" spring and fall 1977), \"Grids, You Say\", In \"Grids: Format and Image in 20th Century Art\" (exh. cat.: Pace Gallery, 1978), and \"Sculpture in the Expanded Field\" (\"October\", spring 1979). Some of these essays are collected in her book \"The Originality of the Avant-Garde and Other Modernist Myths\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The sarcophagus was recovered beginning in 1833 during excavations by St Andrew's Cathedral, but it was not until 1922 that the surviving components were reunited. The sarcophagus is currently on display at the Cathedral museum in St Andrews, close to the site of its discovery.\n\nAs originally constructed the sarcophagus would have comprised two side panels, two end panels, four corner pieces and a roof slab. The roof slab is entirely missing, as are most of one side and one end panel and a corner piece so that the extant sarcophagus is essentially L-shaped. The external dimensions of the sarcophagus are 177 cm by 90 cm and a height of 70 cm. The stone used is a local sandstone.\n\nThe surviving side panel shows, from right to left, a figure breaking the jaws of a lion, a mounted hunter with his sword raised to strike a leaping lion, and hunter on foot, armed with a spear and assisted by a hunting dog, about to attack a wolf. Although it is not certain that the first two figures represent the same person, 19th century illustrations depict them as if they are. The surviving end panel is much simpler, essentially a cross with four small panels between the arms. The fragments of the missing end panel are similar, but not identical, to the surviving one.\n\nThe Sarcophagus was discovered within the grounds of The Cathedral near the St Regulus Chapel. The Cathedral had been in use from when it was constructed during the 1100s until it was stripped of all its altars and images, left in ruins and abandoned after 1559 during the Reformation. Much of its remaining stonework was recycled over the years into buildings in the town of St Andrews. \n\nIn the course of digging a grave in 1833, workmen discovered the remaining large fragments of the sarcophagus at a depth of about 6 to 8 feet. Through the years various casts of the pieces were made but the original pieces were not reassembled until 1922.\n\nHistorians differ on who was likely to have been interred in the sarcophagus. Although it is generally presumed that it was commissioned by the Pictish King Óengus, or Onuist, a Christian who died in 761, whether it was actually used for his corpse, for his predecessor, Nechtan mac Der Ilei, or for a later personage is unclear.\n\n"}
{"id": "49054581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49054581", "title": "Swan Service", "text": "Swan Service\n\nThe Swan Service (German: \"Schwanenservice\") is a large service of baroque Meissen porcelain which was made for the First Minister of the Electorate of Saxony, Heinrich von Brühl. Augustus III, Elector of Saxony and also King of Poland, had made Brühl the Supervisor of the Meissen works in 1733, then in August 1739 its Director. The Swan Service has been called \"the most famous high baroque production in Meissen porcelain\", \"a triumph of modelling and firing\", and \"the most fabulous tableware conceived in porcelain\". After earlier work with prototypes, the Meissen designers and modellers Johann Joachim Kändler, Johann Friedrich Eberlein and (from about 1741) Johann Gottlieb Ehder created the service, which consists of over 2,200 individual pieces, between 1737 and 1742.\n\nA service on such a scale and with such lavish sculptural elements was unprecedented; a later large Meissen service, the Möllendorff Dinner Service of the 1760s had under 1,000 pieces. The distinctive characteristic of the service, from which it gets its name, is its decoration in very low relief: each plate or other piece of flatware has a delicate background with radiating bands based on a scallop shell, against which there is in the central well a pair of swans on the water amid bullrushes, and a crane in the air, descending to join another on the left. The standing crane grasps a fish in his beak, and the head of another fish can be seen in the water beneath the swan on the right. \"Brühl\" in German means a damp, marshy place, so the theme of the service was a play on its owner's name.\n\nIn January 1738 Kändler spent three days in the royal natural history collection at Dresden, where \"I drew all sorts of shells and examined them closely, so that the ... service could be realized in the most natural manner\". Such relief backgrounds were a speciality of Meissen under Kändler, but were usually more geometrical, as in the \"osier\" patterns, imitating wickerwork, or the \"Dulong border\" (from 1743) with a rather neoclassical plant-scroll pattern.\n\nLarge pieces include opulent centrepieces, numerous candelabra, tureens. There are other items including teapots and cups and wall-sconces as well as the standard items of dinnerware. The decoration, apart from the small painted flowers of the pattern called \"indianische Blumen\" (\"Indian flowers\"), is themed around water and the life within, though often mixing fresh water and marine forms. Several parts of the service depict figures from Greco-Roman mythology, like Glaucus and the dolphin-riding Galateia. Almost all pieces of the original service bear the painted impaled coat of arms of Heinrich von Brühl and his wife, countess Franziska Kolowrat-Krakowsky, though pieces were also produced for other customers. Other painted decoration on the flatware pieces is gold rims and small flowers; the figures on the larger pieces are more fully painted.\n\nBrühl was a notoriously extravagant, indeed downright greedy, figure, who was (unlike the king himself, who owned the Meissen factory) allowed as Director to commission and receive Meissen pieces free. He made lavish use of this privilege, although the Swan Service seems to have been by way of a wedding present from the king for Brühl's marriage in November 1737. Brühl's level of entertaining was exceptional even for the period, and the \"service à la française\" used at the time required large numbers of pieces of tableware, especially for Brühl, who served at every \"publick entertainment\" 80 to 100 different dishes.\n\nWork began by Kändler in 1736, when some sample plates were produced. Work making the moulds began in December 1737, and most shapes were completed by 1741; the service was delivered piecemeal as pieces were finished. Meissen still possess the moulds, and these were used at the time and later to produce items outside the Brühl service itself, including some in limited editions today. Mostly, these lack the armorials.\n\nAbout half the service appears to have been lost in World War II, in particular when the Soviet Red Army occupied Schloss Pförten, the family castle in today's Brody, Żary County in Poland, where the main part was stored, which then burnt down. It is said that pieces were used as targets in a version of clay pigeon shooting. Other items from the service had long been dispersed, which helped to promote its fame, and many museums have items from it, with a trickle of pieces from the original production still appearing on the art market. London auction prices in 2015 include £31,250 for a teacup and saucer, £18,125 for a slop bowl, £6,875 for small fragments of three candlesticks, £15,000 for a saucer and £8,125 for a mustard-pot cover.\n\n\n\n"}

In addition, an agent defends, supports and promotes the interest of their clients. Talent agencies specialize, either by creating departments within the agency or developing entire agencies that primarily or wholly represent one specialty. For example, there are modeling agencies, commercial talent agencies, literary agencies, voice-over agencies, broadcast journalist agencies, sports agencies, music agencies and many more.\n\nHaving an agent is not required, but does help the artist in getting jobs (concerts, tours, movie scripts, appearances, signings, sport teams, etc.). In many cases, casting directors, or other businesses go to talent agencies to find the artists for whom they are looking. The agent is paid a percentage of the star's earnings (typically 10%). Therefore, agents are sometimes referred to as \"10 percenters.\" Various regulations govern different types of agents. The regulations are established by artist's unions and the legal jurisdiction in which the agent operates. There are also professional associations of talent agencies.\n\nTalent agents are considered gatekeepers to their client's careers. They have the ability to reshape and reconstruct their client's image. They are dealmakers and assist their client by orchestrating deals within the entertainment industry, more specifically in the Hollywood entertainment industry. \n\nIn California, because talent agencies are working with lucrative contracts, the agencies must be licensed under special sections of the California Labor Code, which defines an agent as a \"person or corporation who engages in the occupation of procuring, offering, promising, or attempting to procure employment for an artist or artists.\"\n\nAs of 2018, the largest agencies by size are William Morris Endeavor (WME), Creative Artists Agency (CAA), United Talent Agency (UTA) and ICM Partners .\n\nSome talent agencies specialize in the representation of television news broadcast journalists and television news magazine hosts. The journalists and hosts represented by these agents primarily work at television stations in local markets or at networks. There are many job titles for broadcast news journalists such as anchors, reporters, weathercasters, sportscasters, correspondents and hosts.\n\nActors may be interested in working theatrically (stage, film or television) as well as in commercials. Some agents will handle all types of acting work, while others may specialize in a particular area. Some agents work only in the field of television, or only in film and television. Typically, the larger the agency, the more specialized the agents within the agency.\n\nAn agent has two sets of clients: the \"talent\" (actors, models, voice-over artists, etc.) and the \"buyer\". The buyer can be a casting director, advertising agency, production company, photographer, or direct client if the client has an \"in-house\" production staff. Agents promote talent to the buyers, submitting talent who have the appropriate age, race, sex, look, talent, etc. that the buyer is seeking for his/her project. Usually, an agent submits the actor's head shot or the model's composite card or portfolio to the buyer. After the buyer has made choices, the agent then arranges an audition (or for models, a \"go-see\" or open call). After the buyer has met the talent, the buyer will contact the agent if any of the talent will be hired. The agent will coordinate the details of wardrobe, directions, etc., as well as negotiate the contract or pay.\n\nNote that the agent's job is to get the talent auditions; the talent is the only person who can get the job. For their work, agents take a 10 to 20% commission of the gross, depending on whether the job is union (such as SAG-AFTRA) or not. Union jobs are paid per negotiated guidelines, but in non-union jobs the pay is sometimes delayed.\n\nA well established agent will have networks upon networks of contacts. Also, agents have access to professional casting services. Many of these casting resources are not available to the general public.\n\nAlthough most of the successful agents are private individuals unknown to the public, some are celebrities in their own right. Notable current and former talent agents includes David Begelman, Ari Emanuel, Freddie Fields, Johnny Hyde, Irving \"Swifty\" Lazar, Sue Mengers, Quincy Sims, Lew Wasserman, Jadin Wong and The Handbook.\n\nIn the music world, booking agents are different from talent managers. Booking agents are the people who actually book shows for the artists they represent. These agents make all of the arrangements with the promoters of the shows. The booking agent presents the promoter or producer of the concert with a performance agreement, which stipulates the artist's requirements. Items may include lighting, sound, meals, hotel accommodations, and transportation. For concert buyers, they work to find the artist who will fit in the need and available budget.\n\nMany of the major booking agencies refuse to represent clients who are not already signed to a major record label and have national distribution of their music. Because of this, artists on independent record labels often seek representation with an independent booking agency.\n\nBars and nightclubs that specialize in presenting live music on a regular basis often employ an individual to assemble the schedule of events. This individual is the venue's buyer, and should not be confused with the booking agent, who presents a roster of available acts to the buyer. Booking agents may also have contacts known as free-lance promoters. These are individuals who agree to produce a concert by locating a venue, providing a sound system and assembling a staff. Producing a show in this manner, at a location rented out for a single evening, is called “four-walling,” as the process entails renting a venue and receiving no additional services or technical equipment other than the space itself. This has often been the only available option for underground musicians lacking enough popular appeal to gain access to more conventional performance venues (see: Punk rock), but is also used among the genre of raves and various DJ-related events.\n\nThe cost factor of having a booking agent must be weighed against what the agent can do for clients and buyers alike. Some agents represent several different types of artists, while others represent artists in one main area/genre.\n\nSome music agencies deal exclusively with cover bands, listing exclusive and non-exclusive artists on their rosters. In addition, some agencies will also work with a third party company to build specific bands using their own database of vetted musicians, whilst other cover band agencies work with session musicians, that provide a 'flexible' line up for each act.\n\nBooking agents are also used for the cruise ship industry where several different categories of entertainers are needed. These can include individual musicians to be part of the ship's orchestra, small bands and ensembles as well as variety entertainers such as singers, instrumentalists, magicians, comedians and acrobats. Artists looking to work on cruise ships will sign an employment contract with the cruise line and a separate commission contract with the booking agent. The agent will usually be based in the country of origin for the artist.\n\nA music manager (or band manager) handles many career issues for bands, singers, record producers, and DJs. A music manager is hired by a musician or band to help with determining decisions related to career moves, bookings, promotions, business deals, recording contracts, etc. The role of music managers is extensive and may include similar duties to that of a press agent, promoter, booking agent, business manager (who is sometimes a certified public accountant), tour managers, and sometimes even a personal assistant. Responsibilities of a business manager are often divided among many individuals who manage various aspects of a musical career. With an unsigned act, music managers must assume multiple roles: booking agent, graphic designer, publicist, promoter, and accountant. As an artist's career develops, responsibilities grow. A music manager becomes important to managing the many different pieces that make up a career in music. The manager can assist singers, songwriters, and instrumentalists in molding a career, finding music producers, and developing relationships with record companies, publishers, agents, and the music-loving public. The duties of an active music manager will focus on developing a reputation for the musician and building a fan base, which may include mastering and launching a demo CD, developing and releasing press kits, planning promotional activities, and booking shows. A music manager will gain access to a recording studio, photographers, and promotions. He or she will see that CD labels, posters, and promotional materials appropriately represent the band or artist, and that press kits are released in a timely manner to appropriate media. Launching a CD with complementary venues and dates is also a music manager's responsibility.\n\nWith the advent of the internet, established and new talent can have a thriving career in the voice over industry through online casting websites. Whilst there are sites that allow any person to join, a new wave of 'professionals only' casting websites is emerging. In an industry where radio and television voice overs can be recorded in home studios because of technology becoming so affordable, high paying jobs are no longer sourced exclusively through traditional voice talent agents.\n\nSince the decline in viewership in theaters, from the 1950s to 1960s, a monumental shift occurred in how studios produced films and reduced the cost of exclusive and expensive actors. After the shift, actors and actresses were working for the studios but were not owned by one major studio entity, and so were able to work with other studios. This shift has meant that agents were now seen as a necessity instead of an option. Agents became third parties who negotiated between studios and clients, making the need for the agents' services an imperative for each party.\n\nIn the 1980s new agencies were established to compete with the \"Big five.\" In 1991 Bauer-Benedek merged with Leading Artists Agency to form what became United Talent Agency. These agencies were Traid Artists and InterTalent. Traid Artist would eventually be sold to William Morris Agency in 1992, and InterTalent would diminish when its partners dispersed between UTA and ICM in the same year.\n\nBy the 2000s, Hollywood's largest talent agencies were known as the \"big five\" or \"top five\". Creative Artists Agency (CAA), William Morris Agency (WMA), United Talent Agency (UTA), International Creative Management (ICM), and Endeavor. In 2009 two of the agencies, Endeavor and the William Morris Agency, merged to form William Morris Endeavor (WME). In 2012, International Creative Management completed a management buyout and formed a partnership with the new name, ICM Partners.\n\nThe difference between the roles of agents and managers has become smaller and more blurred. A frequent definition of the role of a talent manager is to \"oversee the day-to-day business affairs of an artist; advise and counsel talent concerning professional matters, long-term plans and personal decisions which may affect their career.\" Considerable overlap exists as talent agents may opt to fill exactly the same roles for their clients out of a financial interest in developing the careers of their talent and currying their favor.\n\nVarious state laws and labor guild rules govern the roles reserved to agents, as well as specifying certain special rights, privileges, and prohibitions. In the state of California, the labor code requires licensing of talent agencies and includes regulations such as criminal background checks, maintaining separate operating accounts and client trust accounts, and limits total commissions to twenty-five percent, among other regulations. In contrast, management companies are described as \"often unregulated.\" Agents also have certain privileged powers in situations of verbal agreement and can legally agree to a binding employment offer on behalf of their client.\n\nA prominent difference between agents and managers under California state law is that licensed talent agents and employment agents are the only entities legally allowed to seek work on behalf of their clients. This legal distinction has enabled artists such as the Deftones, Pamela Anderson, Nia Vardalos, Freddie Prinze Jr., and others to break contracts with their managers and avoid commissions owed according to those contracts by proving \"unlicensed procurement\" in court. Because the enforcement against talent managers procuring work is largely carried out through civil litigation and not criminal penalties, managers directly seek out work in defiance of state laws, as clients out of self-interest will seldom object to them doing so and cases alleging illegal procurement are infrequent.\n\nThe Writer's Guild, Screen Actor's Guild, and Director's Guild, among labor guilds, strike agency franchise agreements that specify certain regulations and privileges reserved solely for agents including setting maximum commissions at ten percent of a talent's gross earnings. Managers do not face the same restrictions.\n\n\n\n"}

The exterior was erected in neoclassical-style, with grand interiors.\n\nAscoli Piceno had a communal theater since 1579, located at the site of the palazzo Anzianale. In 1839, the then-existing Teatro Comunale di Legno closed for performances. In order to build a larger arena, a design was commissioned in 1827 from Ireneo Aleandri and construction pursued from 1840 to 1846, when it stopped due to lack of funds. However construction was then sponsored by the engineer Marco Massimi and the merchant Gabriele Gabrielli, and directed by the architect Giambattista Carducci.\n\nThe facade is sober with an entrance through an ionic colonnade. The second floor has a temple front tympanum with pilasters. The atrium is decorated with stucco statues by Giorgio and Emidio Paci, depicting Apollo and Minerva, the muses of tragedy, comedy, music, and dance. The theater ceiling was decorated by Ferdinando Cicconi, with medallions depicting \"Donizetti\", \"Rossini\", \"Bellini\", and \"Verdi\". Cesare Recanatini painted for the Theater a curtain a Vedute of the Piazza del Popolo. Another sipario depicts the \"Triumph of Ventidio Basso for his Victory over the Parthians\" by Vincenzo Podesti (brother of Francesco Podesti|Francesco]]). The theater has four rows of balconies with seating for over 800 spectators.\n\nIn 1846, the first performances were of the operas of \"Ernani\" and I Puritani, with the soprano Anna De la Grange, in leading roles. She is one of the busts in the atrium. Refurbishments over the years include electric lighting (1907) and cinema projector (1917). The theater was closed for restoration in 1979, only to re-open in 1994.\n\nThe theater is named by Ventidio Basso, local made prisoner during the Social Wars of the Roman Republic. He became a military and political leader for Julius Caesar and Marc Antony. Ventidio has honored with a triumph for a victory against the Parthians in 38-39 B.C.\n"}

Based on the memoir of the same name by Eliot Ness and Oscar Fraley, it fictionalized Ness's experiences as a Prohibition agent, fighting crime in Chicago in the 1930s with the help of a special team of agents handpicked for their courage, moral character, and incorruptibility, nicknamed the Untouchables. The book was later made into a film in 1987 (also called \"The Untouchables\") by Brian De Palma, with a script by David Mamet, and a second, less-successful TV series in 1993.\n\nA dynamic, hard-hitting action drama, and a landmark television crime series, \"The Untouchables\" won series star Robert Stack an Emmy Award for Best Actor in a Dramatic Series in 1960.\n\nThe series originally focused on the efforts of a real-life squad of Prohibition agents employed by the United States Department of the Treasury and led by Eliot Ness (Stack), that helped bring down the bootleg empire of \"Scarface\" Al Capone, as described in Ness's bestselling 1957 memoir. This squad was nicknamed \"The Untouchables\", because of their courage and honesty; they could not be bribed or intimidated by the Mob. Eliot Ness himself had died suddenly in May 1957, shortly before his memoir and the subsequent TV adaptation were to bring him fame beyond any he experienced in his lifetime.\n\nThe pilot for the series was a two-part episode entitled \"The Untouchables\" originally aired on CBS's \"Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse\" on April 20 and 27, 1959. Later retitled \"The Scarface Mob\", these episodes, which featured Neville Brand as Al Capone, were the only episodes in the series to be more-or-less directly based on Ness's memoir, and ended with the conviction and imprisonment of Capone. CBS, which had broadcast most of Desilu's television output since 1951 beginning with \"I Love Lucy\", was offered the new series following the success of the pilot film. Chairman William S. Paley rejected it on the advice of network vice president Hubbell Robinson. ABC agreed to air the series, and \"The Untouchables\" premiered on October 15, 1959. In the pilot movie, the mobsters generally spoke with unrealistic pseudo-Italian accents, but this idiosyncratic pronunciation was dropped when the series debuted.\n\nThe weekly series first followed the premise of a power struggle to establish a new boss in Capone's absence (for the purpose of the TV series, the new boss was Frank Nitti, although this was contrary to fact). As the series continued, there developed a highly fictionalized portrayal of Ness and his crew as all-purpose crime fighters who went up against an array of gangsters and villains of the 1930s, including Ma Barker, Dutch Schultz, Bugs Moran, Vincent \"Mad Dog\" Coll, Legs Diamond, Lucky Luciano, and in one episode, Nazi agents.\n\nThe terse narration by gossip columnist Walter Winchell, in his distinctive New York accent, was a stylistic hallmark of the series, along with its melancholy theme music by Nelson Riddle and its shadowy black-and-white photography, influenced by film noir.\n\nThe show drew harsh criticism from some Italian-Americans, including Frank Sinatra, who felt it promoted negative stereotypes of them as mobsters and gangsters. The Capone family unsuccessfully sued CBS, Desilu Productions, and Westinghouse Electric Corporation for their depiction of the Capone family. In the first episode of the first season, the character of \"Agent (Rico) Rossi\", a person of Italian extraction who had witnessed a gangland murder, was added to Ness's team.\n\nOn March 9, 1961, Anthony Anastasio, chief of the Brooklyn waterfront and its International Longshoremen's Association, marched in line with a picket group who identified themselves as \"The Federation of Italian-American Democratic Organizations\". In protest formation outside the ABC New York headquarters, they had come together to urge the public boycott of Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company (L&M) products, including Chesterfield King cigarettes, the lead sponsor of \"The Untouchables\". They expressed displeasure with the program, which to them vilified Italian-Americans, stereotyping them as the singular criminal element. The boycott and the attendant firestorm of publicity had the effect Anastasio and his confederates wanted. Four days after the picket of ABC, L&M, denying it had bowed to intimidation, announced it would drop its sponsorship of \"The Untouchables\", maintaining the decision was based on network-scheduling conflicts. The following week, the head of Desilu, Desi Arnaz (who had attended high school with Capone's son Albert), in concert with ABC and the \"Italian-American League to Combat Defamation\", issued a formal three-point manifesto:\n\n\nThe series also incurred the displeasure of the powerful director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, J. Edgar Hoover, when the fictionalized scripts depicted Ness and his Treasury agents involved in operations that were actually the province of the FBI. The second episode of the series, for example, depicted Ness and his crew involved in the capture of the Ma Barker gang, an incident in which the real-life Ness played no part. The producers agreed to insert a spoken disclaimer on future broadcasts of the episode stating that the FBI had primary responsibility for the Barker case.\n\n\"The Untouchables\" was an unusually violent program for its time and its excessive violence and surprisingly frank depictions of drug abuse and prostitution were described by the National Association for Better Radio and Television as \"not fit for the television screen\".\n\nIn an article titled \"The New Enemies of 'The Untouchables'\" Ayn Rand argued that the persistent, superficial attacks received by \"The Untouchables\" were due to its appeal and its virtues: its moral conflict and moral purpose.\n\nThe series had 118 episodes which ran 50 minutes each. Though the book chronicled the experiences of Ness and his cohorts against Capone, and in reality the Untouchables disbanded soon after Capone's conviction, the series continued after the pilot and book ended, depicting the fictitious further exploits of the Untouchables against many, often real life, criminals over a span of time ranging from 1929 to 1935. The television episodes were broadcast in no chronological timeline, but were set mostly in the early 1930s (for example, one episode, \"You Can't Pick the Number\", begins with Winchell's words, \"October 1932: the depth of the Depression\"). A few episodes were set primarily in a locale other than Chicago (such as the one dealing with the shootout involving Ma Barker and her gang.) Characters and \"facts\" in the majority of the episodes were more often than not entirely fictitious or loosely based composites of true-life criminals of that era. The gripping theme music was by Nelson Riddle.\n\nQuinn Martin produced the show's first season, which contained elements that could be found in future TV series produced by Martin.\n\nThe most prominent Untouchables were portrayed by:\n\nOther Untouchables members who were prominent at first, but didn't last past the pilot or the first season, were portrayed by :\n\n\nIn addition to the Untouchables themselves, there were several recurring allies in more than one episode:\n\nThe show also had several recurrent gangsters, many of them loosely based on real life gangsters of the time period:\n\n\nFinally, heard in every episode, but never shown onscreen:\n\n\nPaul Picerni and Nicholas Georgiade were cast as gangsters in Capone and Nitti's mob in the 1959 pilot before being cast in the series.\n\n\"The Untouchables\" was notable for the large number of past and future motion picture and television stars who appeared as guest stars on the show during its four-year run. These include: (S#=Season number, E#=Episode number)\n\n\"The Untouchables\" originally aired as a segment of the anthology series \"Desilu Playhouse\" in 1959. It was picked up as a regular series by ABC for the 1959 season and was aired on Thursdays from 9:30 to 10:30pm from 1959 to 1962, switching to Tuesday evenings from 9:30 to 10:30pm for its final season (1962-63).\n\nDesilu Productions president Desi Arnaz had originally offered the role of Ness to Van Johnson. Johnson's wife and manager rejected the deal, and demanded double the salary offer. Arnaz refused and signed Stack, instead. Arnaz had had a long business relationship with CBS, which had aired many Desilu programs, including \"I Love Lucy\" and \"The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour\". When CBS refused to buy the program, Arnaz sold it to ABC.\n\nIn 1961, Neville Brand reprised his role as Al Capone in the movie \"The George Raft Story\".\n\nSome segments were released to theaters as movies: \"The Scarface Mob\" (from the two-part pilot), \"The Alcatraz Express\" (from \"The Big Train\"), and \"The Gun of Zangara\" (from \"Unhired Assassin\").\n\nOn November 10, 1991, NBC ran the two-hour movie \"The Return of Eliot Ness\", with Robert Stack as Ness. It was set in 1947, after Capone's death, and depicted Ness investigating the death of an Untouchables agent named Labine.\n\n\"The Untouchables\" was a landmark television series, that has spawned numerous imitators over the decades, such as \"S.W.A.T.\", \"The F.B.I.\", \"Crime Story\", the original \"Hawaii Five-O\" (Five-O's creator and executive producer, Leonard Freeman, served as executive producer on \"The Untouchables\" final season), Robert Stack's two later series, \"Strike Force\" and \"Most Wanted\", \"The Hat Squad\", and the 1993 \"The Untouchables\" syndicated TV series.\n\nIt also inspired the big-budget motion pictures \"Al Capone\" starring Rod Steiger, \"The Untouchables\" (with Kevin Costner), \"Gangster Squad\", \"Mulholland Falls\", and others.\n\"The Untouchables\" is one of two series from 1959, the other being \"The Detectives\", together credited with the concept of depicting a \"group\" of crime fighters. Previously, most TV crime dramas had followed one of two formats: either a duo composed of a stalwart police officer or detective and his trusty sidekick/partner (\"Dragnet\", \"The Lineup\"), or a lone-wolf private eye or police detective (\"Peter Gunn\", \"Richard Diamond\", \"M-Squad\").\n\nThe series was spoofed in the 1963 Merrie Melodies cartoon short \"The Unmentionables\", with Bugs Bunny playing the role of Elegant Mess, a crime fighter who is assigned to infiltrate a black market ring operated by Rocky and Mugsy. The series was also spoofed on an episode of the 1961-62 ABC-TV/Hanna Barbara cartoon series \"Top Cat\" entitled \"The Unscratchables\". NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" spoofed The Untouchables several times during the 1970s, with Dan Aykroyd playing Eliot Ness.\n\nIn their 1988 book, \"The Critics' Choice—The Best of Crime and Detective TV\", authors Max Allan Collins and John Javna chose \"The Untouchables\" as one of the \"Top 10 Best Police TV Series (Police Procedurals) of All Time\".\n\nThe Lebanon (Pa.) \"Daily News\" said of \"The Untouchables\": \"Between the hard-nosed approach, sharp dialogue, and a commendably crisp pace (something rare in dramatic TV at the time), this series is one of the few that remains fresh and vibrant. Only the monochrome presentation betrays its age. \"The Untouchables\" is one of the few Golden Age TV shows that deserves being called a classic.\"\n\nIn 1997, the episode \"The Rusty Heller Story\" was ranked number 99 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time.\n\nCBS DVD (distributed by Paramount Home Entertainment) have released all four seasons of \"The Untouchables\" on DVD in region 1, all digitally remastered from the original negatives and presented uncut, unedited and in its original broadcast order. The first two seasons have also been released in region 4.\n\nOn May 10, 2016, CBS DVD released \"The Untouchables- The Complete Series\" on DVD in Region 1.\n\nParamount Home Entertainment has released the first three seasons of \"The Untouchables\" on DVD in the UK. These releases are full-season sets as opposed to Region 1 and 4 where each season has been split into two volumes.\n\nThe TV show was also adapted into a comic book by Dan Spiegle, distributed by Dell Comics.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17817477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17817477", "title": "Theorica", "text": "Theorica\n\nTheorica (Gr. ) (also Theoric Fund and Festival Fund) was in ancient Athens the name for the fund of monies expended on festivals, sacrifices, and public entertainments of various kinds; and also monies distributed among the people in the shape of largesses from the state.\n\nThere were, according to Xenophon, more festivals at Athens than in all the rest of Greece. Besides those open to the whole body of the people, there were many confined to the members of each tribe, deme, and house. These last were provided for out of the private funds of the community who celebrated them. At the most important of the public festivals, there were not only sacrifices, but processions, theatrical exhibitions, gymnastic contests, and games, celebrated with great splendor and at a great expense.\n\nTheorika was created or reinstated around 350 BCE, after the Social War (357-5 BCE), by the Athenian statesman Eubulus, an administrator to the theorikon treasury sometime after 354/3 until Cephisophon of Aphidna replaced him in 343/2, and Diophantus. The Social War had plunged Athens into serious military and financial difficulties, thus creating an incentive to help the Athenian people by means of largesse. It was established to provide enough money for poorer Athenian citizens to be able to purchase tickets for yearly festivals of public worship and theatrical productions, such as the Dionysia, Panathenaea, Eleusinia and Thargelia. A portion of the expense was defrayed by the individuals, upon whom the burden of devolved; but a considerable, and perhaps the larger, part was defrayed by the public treasury. The religious embassies to Delos and other places, and especially those to the Olympian, Nemean, Isthmian, and Pythian Games, drew largely upon public funds, though a part of the cost fell upon the wealthier citizens who conducted them.\n\nThe amount of money contributed to this treasury varied between “15 talents or less and not much under 100 talents”. In an epitome (Dem. 1 hyp. 5) of Demosthenes’ \"First Olynthiac\", a scholar named Libanius explains that in Athens there were no stone seats (only wooden benches) at the Theatre of Dionysus, and also originally no charge for admissions into the festival. Due to the lack of seating available, fights would break out as everyone rushed to find a bench; the leaders of the community decided to charge an admissions fee of two obols to prevent further violence. The fee was paid to the lessee of the theater (called , , or ) who undertook to keep it in good repair, and constantly ready for use, on condition of being allowed to receive the profits. But because poorer citizens could not afford to pay for admittance, Athens established a fund that covered the costs of their tickets. Each citizen was allotted one drachma to cover the ticket cost of two obols (διωβελία) on each day of the three-day Dionysia. The payments would differ depending on the fluctuations of the state treasury and how many days the festivals lasted.\n\nThis payment continued to be exacted after the stone theater was built. Pericles, to relieve the poorer classes, passed a law that enabled them to receive the price of admission from the state; after which all those citizens who were too poor to pay for their places applied for the money in the public assembly, which was then frequently held in the theater.\n\nIn time this donation was extended to other entertainments besides theatrical ones: the sum of two obols being given to each citizen who attended; if the festival lasted two days, four obols; and if three, six obols ; but not beyond that. Hence all theoric largesses received the name of \"diobelia\" (). The sums thus given varied at different times, and of course depended on the state of the public treasury. These distributions of money, like those of grain and flour, were called \"dianomai\" (), or \"diadoseis\" (). They were often made at the Dionysia, when the allies were present, and saw the surplus of their tribute distributed from the orchestra. The appetite of the people for largesses grew by encouragement, stimulated from time to time by designing demagogues; and in the time of Demosthenes they seem not to have been confined to the poorer classes. The German classical scholar Philipp August Böckh calculated that from 25 to 30 talents were spent upon them annually.\n\nIn the earlier times there was no person, or board of persons, expressly appointed to manage the Theoric fund. The money thus appropriated was disbursed by the \"Hellenotamiai\". After the anarchy, the largess system having been restored by Agyrrhius, a board of managers was appointed, possibly consisting of ten men, who were called by many names (, or , &c.). They were elected by show of hands at the period of the great Dionysia, one from each tribe, and served four-year terms. In the time of Eubulus many other branches of the administration were placed under the control of this board; as the management of the civil expenditure, the office of the \"Apodektai\", the building of docks, arsenals, streets, &c. This was dictated by an anxiety on the part of the people that no part of the revenue should be improperly diverted from the Theoric fund, which they thought would be prevented by increasing the powers of its managers. But these extraordinary powers appear not to have been of long continuance.\n\nAristotle explains:\n\n“\"All the officials concerned with civilian administration are appointed by lot, apart from the treasurer of the army fund (ταμίας στρατιωτικόν), the men in charge of the festival fund and the curator of the water supply; these are elected, and hold office from one Panathenaea to the next.\"” (Ath. Const. 43.1)\n\nAs public revenue greatly increased in the Athenian state, so too did the Theoric administration; according to Demosthenes there was an increase to as much as 400 talents a year from a previous amount of 130 talents (Phil. iv 37-8). As a result of this growth the Theoric Board began to extend itself into a powerful position over other public works, activities and boards that were supervised by the βουλή (Council of Five Hundred). The boule had previously controlled the state revenue and the expenditures, as well as the appropriations of monies to the magistrates, with the help of the different boards: the poletai (Auctions Board) and the apodektai (Board of Receivers). When the Theoric administration rose in power and worked together with the boule, it put the administration in a position where “it must have had a fair chance of securing for itself the lion’s share of the appropriations and possibly supplementing this share by a surplus”. The powerful position also enabled its board members to acquire confidential knowledge, information once only shared among those in the boule, on the activities of other departments. This weakened the monopoly of the boule and, as a result, the Theoric officials were able to gain supreme financial insight and replace the boule as the main resource of finances. Men seeking popularity in Athens recognized this growth of power and influence as a source of great opportunity, and eventually the Theoric Board eclipsed and absorbed all other financial offices. Utilizing this power, the Theoric Board proceeded to oversee the leasing of mines, the financing of expensive public works, such as roads and buildings, and money for the Athenian navy. Aeschines scornfully describes this new monopoly of power in his speech \"Against Ctesiphon\":\n\n“\"…they [the Theoric Board] also controlled the dockyards, had charge of the naval arsenal that was building, and were Superintendents of Streets; almost the whole administration of the state was in their hands.\"” (3.25)\n\nBefore the theorika was established, the stratiotika (τὰ στρατιωτικά), or Military (Stratiotic) Fund, received any remaining surplus revenue if Athens was at war; this provided financing for military expenditures. But immediately after the Social War, all surplus revenue was allotted to the theorika until Demosthenes fought to have it redirected back to the stratiotika in 339/8. Demosthenes was a strong proponent in the fight against the rising power of Philip II of Macedon and believed that all surplus monies should be used for military campaigns rather than for domestic public works; Eubulus, on the other hand, was very much against expensive foreign expeditions. After the Social War Eubulus and his followers, the “peace party”, believed that the Athenian αρχή was no more, so they used the theorika to “restrain the demos from rash imperialistic adventures” and to convince the people that peace was beneficial. The theorika had become, in a sense, a psychological tool for this political party to repress the war mentality by exploiting the selfishness of the Athenians. It was also a “crucial factor in the process of shaping and distorting perceptions”, which might explain the denial of Philip as an immediate threat, and also why the Athenians were more thorough in their organizations of festivals than with their own military (Dem. Phil. i 35-6). In the \"First Olynthiac\", delivered in 349 BCE, Demosthenes complains that Athens has the means to fight Philip but would rather use its money for pleasure:\n\n“\"Such are my views on the expeditionary force. With regard to the supply of money, you have money, men of Athens; you have more than any other nation has for military purposes. But you appropriate it yourselves, to suit your own pleasure. Now if you will spend it on the campaign, you have no need of a further supply; if not, you have--or rather, you have no supply at all. ‘What!’ someone will cry, ‘do you actually move to use this money for military purposes?’ Of course I do not. Only it is my opinion that we must provide soldiers and that there must be one uniform system of pay in return for service. Your opinion, however, is that you should, without any trouble, just appropriate the money for your festivals. Then the only alternative is a war-tax, heavy or light, as circumstances demand. Only money we must have, and without money nothing can be done that ought to be done. There are other proposals before you for raising supplies; choose whichever of them you think expedient, and, while there is yet time, grapple with the problem.\"” (19-20)\n\nMeanwhile a protective law had been passed in Athens illegalizing proposals on the use of the money in the theorika, especially if the suggestions were contradictory to the purpose of the fund (merismos). Demosthenes’ caution when approaching the topic of the theorika in the \"First Olynthiac\" proves that such a law was in existence. Also during this time, in the face of either resisting Philip to retrieve their possessions or betraying their allies and losing them, their cleruchies and the Thracian Chersonese, Apollodorus of Acharnae proposed in the boule (in which he was a member in 348 BCE) that the Athenian people should decide whether the surplus should be used for the theorika or the stratiotika (Dem. 59.4 Against Neaera). The vote was unanimous that the money should be used for the stratiotika against Philip, but, because this type of proposition was still illegal, Apollodorus found himself being indicted by Stephanos of Eroiadai, who drew up a graphe paranomon (γραφή παρανόμων) against him; he was ultimately fined one talent and his decree was made null and void. Following this vote, Eubulus threatened death to anyone who tried to put the interests of the theorika below that of the stratiotika, making the act a capital offense. After Apollodorus’ indictment and Eubulus’ new law, Demosthenes openly suggested in his \"Third Olynthiac\", a speech delivered in 349 BCE in lieu of Philip’s hostilities against Olynthus, that the state get rid of the theorika because of its hampering effect upon their current crisis. He also asked to eliminate military exemptions for those who ran the Dionysian festivals in Athens, as it was demoralizing for the men who wished to serve their country:\n\n“\"In plain language I mean the laws for administering the Theoric Fund, and also some of the service regulations. The former distribute the military funds as theatre-money among those who remain in the city; the latter give impunity to deserters and in consequence discourage those willing to serve. When you have repealed these laws and made the way safe for wise counsel, then look round for someone who will propose what you all know to be salutary measures. But until you have done this, do not expect to find a statesman who will propose measures for your benefit, only to be ruined by you for his pains. You will never find one, especially as the only result would be that the proposer would get into trouble without improving the situation, and his fate would also make good advice more dangerous for the future. Yes, men of Athens, and you ought to insist that those who made these laws should also repeal them.\"” (3.10-11)\n\nThe idea of demoralization is echoed by Libanius. Instead of being paid wages for serving in the army and enduring the dangers of warfare, Athenian citizens preferred to stay home and attend the religious festivals. Eubulus posed an argument two years after the \"First Olynthiac\" that the Athenians had to accept peace with Philip (the Peace of Philocrates, which Aeschines supported), otherwise they would have to go to the Piraeus, pay a war-tax (eisphora) to finance the fleet and transfer the money from the theorika to the stratiotika (Dem. On the False Embassy 19.291). Eubulus had laid out the different options for the Athenians: they could accept peace with Philip or, if they chose to continue the war, they would have to support it using their own means of financing. Demosthenes’ goal, by criticizing the theorika, was to snap the Athenians out of their denial and mistaken beliefs so that they could recognize the “absurd contradiction between domestic priorities and external exigencies, between the comfortable illusion of peace and the growing crisis in the north.” \n\nBy the \"Fourth Philippic\" Demosthenes’ attitude towards the theorika was changing:\n\n“\"Now there is also another matter, the misrepresentation of which by unfair obloquy and in intemperate language is injuring the State, and furthermore is affording a pretext for those who are unwilling to perform any of their duties as citizens; indeed, you will find that in every case where a man has failed to do his duty, this has been given as the excuse. I am really afraid to speak on this subject, but I will do so nevertheless; for I think I shall be able, with advantage to the State, to plead the cause both of the poor against the rich and of the property-owners against the necessitous. If we could banish from our midst both the obloquy which some heap upon the Theoric Fund, and also the fear that the Fund will not be maintained without doing a great deal of harm, we could not perform a greater service nor one more likely to strengthen the whole body politic.\"” (4.35-37)\n\nDemosthenes’ political party, the “war party”, had always “traditionally (especially in the great days of the Empire) been interventionist externally but ‘Athens-first’ internally.” Seeing that the theorika was crucial to preserving social peace in Athens (Demades, in Plutarch’s \"Mor. 1011b\", referred to it as the “glue of the democracy”), he needed to appeal to both worlds as an impartial arbiter. In the \"Fourth Philippic\" he speaks on behalf of the poor in Athens, reminding the wealthy, who criticized the theorika at its inception, that when the public revenue did not exceed 130 talents a year they remained dutiful and paid their property taxes. With the growth of revenue reaching 400 talents a year, the wealthy no longer felt the weight of financial responsibility upon their shoulders and it was of his opinion that the poor should be able to profit from the increase as well (Phil. iv 37-9).\n\nIn 339 BCE the situation in Athens became much more alarming than in 348 when Philip had attacked Olynthus and its allies, a matter Athens (excluding Demosthenes) did not consider an immediate threat. In 339 Philip had seized Elateia in Phocis, which was a closer and more serious danger to Athens. Demosthenes did not have any trouble persuading the Assembly to allocate all the public funds to the stratiotika and Philochorus, in a fragment preserved by Dionysius of Halicarnassus (ad Ammaeus 1.11), further illustrates Demosthenes’ success:\n\n“\"The people, after listening to the letter [a letter of allegations Philip made against the Athenians] and to the exhortations of Demosthenes, who advocated war and framed the necessary resolutions, passed a resolution to demolish the column erected to record the treaty of peace and alliance with Philip, and further to man a fleet and in every other way to prosecute the war energetically.\"”\n\nThe fact that Demosthenes did not face charges for breaking Eubulus’ law suggests that he was able to have the law repealed sometime around 339. In the year 337/6 Demosthenes became the head of the theorika and donated 10,000 drachmas of his own money (Aesch. 3.24) while revenues were being funneled to the stratiotika; but his donations lasted only one year. Upon the reinstitution of the theorika he attempted, through private gifts and a large festival, to make up for the privileges the Athenians had lost after adopting his financial policy. Shortly after Demosthenes’ promotion the Theoric Board was weakened by the law of Hegemon, which prohibited men from holding offices for more than four years; before this law, Theoric officials could be elected over and over again in successive terms. Hegemon was a member of the opposition party along with Aeschines and Demades, and it is difficult to determine a political reason behind his law other than it was “an intended slap at Demosthenes”. Lycurgus had also become a rival for the boule’s control over finances and climbed the ladder of power until he assumed jurisdiction over the state’s treasury in 337/6 as the Controller of Finances (ὁ ἐπὶ τῆς διοικήσεως), which the Theoric Board had previously monopolized. He governed this seat for twelve consecutive years until 326/5 when his and Demosthenes’ rival, Menesaichmus, took over the position.\n\nDespite its diminishment of powers, the Theoric Board existed in some way or another up until Aristotle’s \"Athenian Constitution\" (326-323 BCE). Lycurgus was using most of the state’s income to pay for its defense, building projects, and religious festivals, which maintained some sense of the theorika’s continuation in Athens. One of the last references to the theorika involved Demades’ notorious attempt at bribing the Athenians. In 331 King Agis III of Sparta persuaded Athens to join him in Sparta’s revolt against Alexander. The Athenians begged Demades, who was then a member of the Theoric Board, to grant money to be used towards the deployment of triremes to aid in the rebellion. His response, as recorded in Plutarch’s \"Morals\" (Praecepta Gerendae Reipublicae 818 E-F), was:\n\n“\"You have money, for I have made provision for the Festival of the Pitchers that each of you receive a half-mina; but if you prefer to use the money for this enterprise, use your own money for the Festival.\"” \n\nDemades’ bribery successfully kept the Athenians from taking up arms against Alexander.\n\n\n"}

Taking the form of a dialogue, the book was written as a response to the criticism Berkeley experienced after publishing \"A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge\".\n\nThree important concepts discussed in the \"Three Dialogues\" are perceptual relativity, the conceivability/master argument and Berkeley's phenomenalism. Perceptual relativity argues that the same object can appear to have different characteristics (e.g. shape) depending on the observer's perspective. Since objective features of objects cannot change without an inherent change in the object itself, shape must not be an objective feature.\n\nIn 1709, Berkeley published his first major work, \"\", in which he discussed the limitations of human vision and advanced the theory that the proper objects of sight are not material objects, but light and colour. This foreshadowed his chief philosophical work, \"A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge\" (1710), which, after its poor reception, he rewrote into the \"Three Dialogues\" (1713).\n\nBerkeley's views are represented by Philonous (Greek: \"lover of mind\"), while Hylas (Greek: \"matter\") embodies the Irish thinker's opponents, in particular John Locke.\n\nIn The First Dialogue, Hylas expresses his disdain for skepticism, adding that he has heard Philonous to have \"maintained the most extravagant opinion... namely, that there is no such thing as \"material substance\" in the world.\" Philonous argues that it is actually Hylas who is the skeptic and that he can prove it. Thus, a philosophical battle of wit begins.\n\nPhilonous questions Hylas systematically regarding what humans know of the world, first examining secondary qualities, such as heat, to show that such qualities do not exist outside the individual mind. He then moves on to primary qualities such as extension and shape, and likewise argues that they, too, are dependent entirely on one's perception (e.g., From a distance, a great mountain appears to be small, and the shape of a thing may change dramatically under a microscope).\n\nHylas's view of matter (which has its origin in the Platonic theory of forms , or abstract entities that exist outside of the sensible world) is systematically destroyed by Philonous (Berkeley). The basic argument is that because matter is only known to us by its sensible qualities, it is impossible to describe or even imagine matter without these qualities. For in the absence of sensible qualities, matter, by definition, loses its essential qualities.\n\nBerkeley's argument goes further: sensible qualities are not inherent in matter. Rather, they are ascribed and understood by the mind. Color, sound, temperature and even shape are qualities entirely dependent on a mind. Indeed, without a \"mind,\" it becomes impossible to imagine \"matter.\" The answer to the question, \"If a tree falls in the forest and no mind is present, does it make a noise?\" is answered by Berkeley's immaterialism: There is no tree. However, God is always perceiving everything. In other words, there is \"always\" a mind present. A human (and thus a human mind) need not be present for the tree to make a sound, for the mind of God is always present, or so Berkeley argues. It is this mind of God that gives sensible qualities to matter, not matter itself.\n\nIn his own time Berkeley faced opposition from many philosophers who held to the Platonic view. These philosophers thought Berkeley vulgar because his own view seemed to confirm the views held by the lower classes. Roughly speaking, the \"common view\" was that God created everything and that the things on earth were the real things. Some philosophers did not believe in God, and believed matter on earth was but an imitation of actual matter that existed in another dimension. Berkeley sided with the common view.\n\nThe philosophy presented is often misinterpreted. The criticism is that Berkeley claims that we live in an illusory world, when in fact, Berkeley advocates for the acceptance of ideas as real \"things.\" When we refer to an object, we don't refer to a material form, but to the idea of the object that informs our senses. Berkeley doesn't propose that \"nothing\" is real; he proposes that \"ideas themselves\" compose reality.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "42517527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42517527", "title": "Women in dance", "text": "Women in dance\n\nThe important place of women in dance can be traced back to the very origins of civilization. Cave paintings, Egyptian frescos, Indian statuettes, ancient Greek and Roman art and records of court traditions in China and Japan all testify to the important role women played in ritual and religious dancing from the start. In the Middle Ages, what has become known as ballet had its beginnings in Italian court festivals when women frequently played the parts of men. It was however in late 17th-century France that the Paris Opera produced the first celebrated ballerinas. While women began to dominate the ballet scene in the 18th century, it was with the advent of Romantic ballet in the 19th century that they became the undisputed centre of attraction with stars playing the leading roles in the works of Marius Petipa, appearing in theatres across Europe from Milan's La Scala to the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg. More recently, women have played a leading role in developing various forms of modern dance including flamenco and expressionist dance.\n\nWomen have always played a predominant role in dance, as can be seen from its earliest history until the emergence of formal dances in the 15th century which developed into ballet.\n\nCave paintings from as long ago as 6000 BC provide scenes of dancing women. Examples can be seen in the Addauta Cave near Palermo and in the Roca dels Moros in Catalonia. In Ancient Egypt, women performed ritual dances for religious ceremonies such as funerals, as illustrated by frescos on the pharaohs' tombs. The oldest records of organised dance and of professional female dancers come from Egypt. Especially in the Old Kingdom, women were organised into groups known as khener, apparently being joined by men only at a later stage.\n\nIn the Indian subcontinent too, there is early evidence of dancing women, most notably a bronze statuette from Mohenjo-daro in the Indus Valley dating from around 2500 BC. While men's early participation in dancing rituals appears to have been connected to hunting and fighting, women's dance was above all related to fertility, both agricultural and human.\n\nDance in classical Crete and Greece seems to have been influenced by the dances of Ancient Egypt. There are many examples of ancient Greek art from the 6th and 5th centuries BC depicting dancing women. The virgins of Delos danced in a circle to honour Apollo while Terpsichore was the Muse of dance. In the 6th century BC, the \"choros\" became a lasting feature of Greek theatre while women known as the Dyonysiac, frequently depicted on Greek vases, dance in frensy, celebrating Dionysus, the god of wine. In Ancient Rome, female singers and dancers performed in the annual celebrations of Isis which included mystery plays representing the resurrection of Osiris.\n\nThe Bible contains several accounts of women dancing, in particular the celebrations led by Miriam after the crossing of the Red Sea when women are said to have danced and played hand-drums. After David had returned from slaying Goliath, women came out singing and dancing. In the New Testament, Matthew tells the story of how Salome danced for Herod in order to be given the head of John the Baptist.\n\nIn China too there is a long recorded history of women dancers since the Zhou Dynasty (c. 1046–256 BC) reaching a peak in the Tang Dynasty (618–907 AD). The chorus dances performed by women in the Zhou dynasty were known as \"xi\". The ancient theatrical spectacles called \"baixi\" probably involved dancing girls in dresses with fluttering silk sleeves. Texts from the Spring and Autumn period (771–476 BC) contain descriptions of professional dancing girls while the Nishang Yuyi dance, created by the Emperor Li Longji (685–762), stages virgin women dancing as if in a magic world. In 12th-century Japan, the Shirabyoshi were famous for their dancing and poetry. One of the most famous was the court dancer Shizuka who appears in the Japanese literature of the period.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, with the spread of Christianity across Europe, the church generally frowned upon dance although there was often dancing at folk festivals, particularly at the beginning of May. In France and Italy, chain and circular dances such as the \"carole\", and the \"tresque\" were popular from the 4th to 14th centuries. They were usually danced in a closed circle with men and women interspersed and holding hands. In Italy, the lively saltarello from Naples became popular in the 14th and 15th centuries. Groups of courtesans dressed as men performed the dance at masquerades.\n\nIn the 15th century, court festivities in Italy became ever more elaborate, often featuring formal dances. One of the early masters was Domenico da Piacenza (c. 1400–1470) who compiled a manual of dance: \"De arte saltandi et choreas ducendi\". In France, too, professional dancing began to take shape when dancers performed for Henry III of France at Fontainebleau in the early 1580s. Further presentations were made for Louis XIII, who frequently took the main part himself. But it was, above all, during the reign of Louis XIV (1643–1715) that the foundations were laid for what became known as ballet. The king not only had the rules of dance written down but established the Académie Royale de Danse in 1661, which developed into today's Paris Opera Ballet. Many of the early ballets were created by the Italian-French composer Jean Baptiste Lully and the French choreographer Pierre Beauchamp, often assisted by Molière.\n\nInitially, female parts in the early ballets were taken by young men; but, in 1681, a young woman known as Mademoiselle De Lafontaine danced in Lully's \"Le Triomphe de l'amour\". She went on to be the leading ballerina in at least 18 other productions at the Paris Opera between 1681 and 1693, establishing the supreme importance of women in ballet. De Lafontaine was succeeded by Marie-Thérèse de Subligny who became the first ballerina to perform in London when she appeared with Claude Ballon in 1699. Said to be the best ballerina of her day, with beautiful eyes and a fine figure, Subligny danced at the Paris Opera from 1688 until her retirement in 1707.\n\nThe next leading dancer of the Opéra was Françoise Prévost (1680–1741), whose precision, lightness and grace contributed much to classical ballet. She persuaded conductor Jean-Féry Rebel to compose suites specifically for ballet. His \"Caprice\", \"Boutade\", \"Les Caractères de la danse\" and \"La Terpsichore\" brought her considerable success. In particular, her personal interpretation of the steps in \"Caprice\" served as an example for other soloists while she transformed the \"Caractères\" into a sequence illustrating different types of lover, both male and female. Prévost trained two highly successful dancers, Marie Camargo (1710–1770) and Marie Sallé (1707–1756), who added their personal preferences to her \"Caractères\", each developing individual styles. They would take her place as prima ballerinas after she retired from the opera in 1730.\n\nCamargo proved to be a tremendous success, not only as a result of her dazzling footwork (especially her entrechat à quatre), but because she introduced slightly shorter skirts and new hair styles. She also discarded high-heeled shoes, introducing dancing slippers which facilitated the execution of the more demanding routines. By dancing demanding routines, which had previously been performed exclusively by men, Camargo further consolidated the image of the ballerina.\n\nSallé sought more from ballet than skillful demonstrations of technique as favoured by proponents of traditional ballet. She believed music, steps, decor and costumes should all contribute to a graceful, expressive performance combining pantomime with dance in what became known as ballet d'action. As many in the Paris Opera did not share her views, she decided to move to the more liberal London. At Covent Garden, she caused a sensation in 1734 as Galatea in \"Pygmalion\", a ballet she had choreographed herself. Discarding the usual attire of a ballerina, she chose to wear a simple muslin tunic and allow her hair to fall freely over her shoulders. The following year, she even decided to dress as a man while performing the role of Cupid but the reviews were extremely critical. As a result, she returned to Paris where she danced at the Opéra until her retirement in 1740 at the young age of 33. Thereafter, she occasionally danced for the court at Versailles.\n\nDuring the second half of the 18th century, the dominating star of the Paris Opera was Marie-Madeleine Guimard who may not have had the technique of Sallé but was nevertheless recognized for her sensuous movements, her numerous suitors and her exotic attire. Other stars included Marie Allard (1738–1802) who joined the Paris Opera in 1756 where she was trained by Gaétan Vestris, becoming not just an étoile but also his wife. Although she was rather corpulent and frequently pregnant, she was acclaimed for her impressive footwork.\n\nThe most successful period for female ballet dancers was around the 1830s and 1840s when they became the great stars of Romantic ballet. The Italian-Swedish Marie Taglioni (1804–1884) not only excelled at the Paris Opera when she danced \"La Sylphide\" in 1832 but extended her fame to Saint Petersburg's Mariinsky Ballet as well as to the stages of Berlin, Milan and London until her retirement in 1847. It was she who developed ballet's en pointe (dancing on the tips of the toes) while introducing new fashions in dress and hair styling which became popular throughout Europe. The Austrian Fanny Elssler (1810–1884) gained fame and fortune by dancing the flirtatious Spanish cachucha in \"Le Diable boiteux\", performing not only in Austria, Germany, France, England and Russia but also in the United States. Nevertheless, in 1845 she refused to dance with her rivals Marie Taglioni, Carlotta Grisi, Fanny Cerrito, and Lucile Grahn in Jules Perrot's \"Pas de Quatre\".\n\nPresented at Her Majesty's Theatre in London, the \"Pas de Quatre\" caused a sensation, bringing together the four greatest ballerinas of the day. In addition to Marie Taglioni, Italy's Grisi (1819–1899) had become famous both in Paris and Saint Petersburg for her \"Giselle\", while Cerrito from Naples had become the star of La Scala in Milan. Grahn (1819–1907), a Dane trained by Bournonville, was based in Paris but had also danced in London, Saint Petersburg and Milan before settling in Germany.\n\nSeveral notable Italian ballerinas emerged in the second half of the 19th century, reaching their zeniths in Russia. Italian-born Virginia Zucchi (1849–1933) first danced in Italy and Germany but her interpretations of Marius Petipa's ballet in Russia were so successful that the Tzar insisted she should join the Mariinsky Ballet in Saint Petersburg. In the mid-1880s, she starred in \"Coppélia\", \"La fille mal gardée\" and \"La Esmeralda\", revolutionizing ballet in Russia through the extraordinary power of her performances. Pierina Legnani (1863–1930) from Milan followed as similar path, also dancing at the Mariinsky from 1892 where she originated famous roles in Petipa's ballets including \"Cinderella\", \"Swan Lake\" and \"Raymonda\", gaining the title of prima ballerina assoluta. Carlotta Brianza (1867–1930), also from Milan, first gained fame at La Scala with which she toured the United States. She is remembered above all for dancing Aurora at the premiere of Petipa's \"Sleeping Beauty\" in 1890.\n\nNew, more dynamic approaches to ballet developed from the beginning of the 20th century, the most influential being Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, promoting innovative collaborations between choreographers, composers and dancers. One of the early stars was Anna Pavlova (1881–1931) who gained fame by dancing \"The Dying Swan\" choreographed by Mikhail Fokine before joining the Ballets Russes in 1909. Her rival, Tamara Karsavina (1885–1978), who also performed with the Ballets Russes, is remembered above all for creating the title role in Fokine's \"The Firebird\". Olga Spessivtseva (1895–1991) danced with the Mariinsky in Saint Petersburg but also toured with the Ballets Russes, dancing Aurora in Diaghilev's \"The Sleeping Princess\" (1921) in London.\n\nBallet also began to develop in London, thanks mainly to the efforts of two women. Polish-born Marie Rambert (1888–1982) who had also gained experience with the Ballets Russes founded the Ballet Club (later the Rambert Dance Company) in 1926 introducing new choreographers such as Frederick Ashton. Even more influential, Ninette de Valois (1898–2001) spent three years with the Ballets Russes before creating London's Vic-Wells Ballet in 1931 (later becoming the Royal Ballet) where Alicia Markova (1910–2004) was the first prima ballerina, starring in ballets from the Mariinsky's classical productions. Markova left to form her own touring company in 1937. Ten years later Margot Fonteyn (1919–1991) became the company's prima ballerina. The height of her fame came in 1961 when she embarked on a partnership with Rudolf Nureyev, first in \"Giselle\", until she retired in 1979.\n\nAs ballet developed in the United States, Maria Tallchief (1925–2013), the first major American prima ballerina, was promoted by the choreographer Bronislava Nijinska (1891–1972) when she joined the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in New York in 1942. She danced as a soloist in George Balanchine's arrangements for \"Song of Norway\" in 1944. As Balanchine's wife, she soon became the star of the New York City Ballet. Lucia Chase (1897–1986) was a co-founder of the American Ballet Theatre in 1939 and became its artistic director for over 40 years, overseeing the production of a wide variety of new ballets. Several outstanding American ballerinas have emerged over the years including Gelsey Kirkland (born 1952), who performed the leading role in \"The Firebird\" when she was just 17, and Suzanne Farrell (born 1945) who was the star of Balanchine's \"Don Quixote\" in 1965.\n\nWomen have also contributed significantly to most other forms of dance, in particular flamenco, modern dance, expressionist dance, belly dance and cabaret which led to musical theatre.\n\nFlamenco music originated in the south of Spain in the 15th century, probably resulting from the influence of the Moors with possible origins in India. While many of the singers who emerged in the 18th century were men, women increasingly gained fame as dancers. One of the earliest was Juana la Macarrona (1860–1947) who first performed in Seville with singer Silverio Franconetti but soon become popular not only throughout Spain but across Europe. Lola Flores (1923–1995) is remembered for singing and dancing Andalusian folklore, especially flamenco, copla and chotis. Angelita Vargas (born 1946) is considered to be one of the greatest stars of Andalusian flamenco dancing, touring Europe, the United States, Japan and Australia.\n\nLed by women, various styles of modern dance began to develop towards the end of the 19th century. Loie Fuller (1862–1928) from Chicago was one of the pioneers. She employed her own natural approach to movement and improvisation, later becoming a star at the Folies Bergères in Paris. Inspired by Greek art, Isadora Duncan (1877–1927) from San Francisco paved the way to the modern free dance style believing it was more important to express the essence of life through movement rather than to follow the precepts of classical ballet. Raised on a farm in New Jersey, Ruth St. Denis (1879–1968) developed her own interpretations of Oriental dance as an expression of spiritualism. The American Martha Graham (1894–1991) exerted considerable influence on the development of modern dance through her New York-based Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance. Other female figures who contributed to developments in the mid-20th century include Doris Humphrey (1895–1958) who choreographed Afro-American spirituals and Helen Tamiris (1905–1966) who played an important part in choreographing early musicals. Another major choreographer of Broadway musicals was German-born Hanya Holm (1893–1992), a student of Mary Wigman.\n\nThe German Mary Wigman is credited as the creator of expressionist dance. Inspired by Oriental percussion, she often stressed the macabre. Hertha Feist (1896–1990), also from Germany, was an expressionist dancer and choreographer. She established her own school in Berlin, combining gymnastics with nudism and dance although her ambitions were later seriously curtailed by the Nazis. Also an associate of Wigman, Gret Palucca (1902–1993) opened her own schools in Germany in the 1920s and 1930s but they were later closed because of her Jewish ancestry. One of her students, Dore Hoyer (1911–1967), who was also an associate of Mary Wigman, developed her own programmes before the Second World War in Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden. After the war she became ballet director at the Hamburg State Opera.\n\nWhile belly dancing appears to have its origins in the distant past, it was introduced to Europe and North America towards the end of the 19th century. Several of Egypt's film actresses performed belly dancing in the musicals of the 1930s and 1940s. Early stars included Tahia Carioca (1919–1999), Samia Gamal (1924–1994) and Nelly Mazloum (1929–2003). From the 1960s, belly dance became increasingly popular across the United States with stars including Dalilah (bellydancer) (1936–2001), Dahlena and Serena (1933–2007).\n\nWomen started to sing and dance in the cabarets of Paris in the 1890s, emphasizing the female body by introducing seductive movements highlighting their breasts and hips. Most of them had no formal training, the exception being Cléo de Mérode (1875–1966) who left the Paris Opera to perform at the Folies Bergère. The major choreographer was Algerian-born Mariquita (1830–1922) who became ballet director at the Folies Bergère and the Opéra Comique. Stars of the period included the Spanish La Belle Otero from Galicia who gained fame at Charles Franconi's Cirque d'été in 1890, Émilienne d’Alençon (1869–1946) who danced at the Folies Bergère, and Dutch-born Mata Hari (1876–1917) who from 1905 became famous for her Indonesian-inspired temple dance, first in Paris and then in other European capitals. La Goulue (1866–1929) is remembered for dancing the cancan at the Moulin Rouge in the 1890s.\n\n\n"}

The original museum was located in a log house, made with trees cut and shipped downriver from Bethel by barge. By 1968, the Bethel Council on the Arts managed the museum. The City of Bethel took over management of the museum again, and the objects were moved into a new log cabin. On July 4, 1970, it opened and was renamed the Yugtarvik Regional Museum. The log cabin was gutted by fire in 1980, damaging both the building and collection. It was broken into several times since opening and closed periodically for lack of volunteer staff.
