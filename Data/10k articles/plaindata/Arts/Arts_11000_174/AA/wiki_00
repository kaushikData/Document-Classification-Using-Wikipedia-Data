{"id": "1939093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939093", "title": "Adult animation", "text": "Adult animation\n\nAdult animation, adult cartoon or mature animation, is any type of animated motion work that is mainly targeted towards adults and older adolescents, as opposed to children or all-ages audiences. Works in this genre may be considered adult for any number of reasons, such as complex themes, sexual or suggestive content, graphic violence, profane language or dark humor. Works in this genre may explore philosophical, political, or social issues. Some productions are noted for sophisticated and/or experimental storytelling and animation techniques.\n\nIn the United States, before the enforcement of the Hays Code, some cartoon shorts contained humor that was aimed at adult audience members rather than children. Following the introduction of the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system, independent animation producers attempted to establish an alternative to mainstream animation. Initially, few animation studios in the United States attempted to produce animation for adult audiences, but later examples of animation produced for adults would gain mainstream attention and success.\n\nThe earliest cartoon series were based upon popular comic strips, and were directed at family audiences. Most animation produced during the silent film era was not intended to be shown to any specific age group, but occasionally contained humor that was directed at adult audience members, including risqué jokes. The assumed audience of these early cartoons, particularly \"Looney Tunes\", has alternated from their initial unspecific audience, to children, and back to general audiences as \"classics\". The earliest known instance of censorship in animation occurred when the censorship board of Pennsylvania requested that references to bootlegging be removed from Walt Disney's 1925 short \"Alice Solves a Puzzle\". One of the earliest animated pornographic films was \"Eveready Harton in Buried Treasure\", produced circa 1928. It has often been suggested that the film was produced for a private party in honor of Winsor McCay. Rumors suggest that the film was developed in Cuba years after it was completed, because no lab in New York City would process the film. When a print was screened in San Francisco in the late 1970s, the program notes attributed the animation to George Stallings, George Canata, Rudy Zamora, Sr. and Walter Lantz.\n\nThe Motion Picture Association of America, then known as the Motion Pictures Producers and Distributors Association, was established in 1922 as the result of public objection to adult content in films, and a series of guidelines were established, suggesting content that should not be portrayed in films. Until the Hays Code was enforced, many animated shorts featured suggestive content, including sexual innuendo, references to alcohol and drug use, and mild profanity. In the 1933 short \"Bosko's Picture Show\", Bosko appears to use adult words, although it has also been suggested that the character is saying \"fox\", or even \"mug\".\n\nThe Betty Boop series was known for its use of jokes that would eventually be considered taboo following the enforcement of the Hays Code, including the use of nudity. Betty Boop was initially drawn as a dog, and cast as the girlfriend of another Fleischer character, Bimbo. Betty was redesigned as a human, but the series continued to suggest a love relationship between the two that went farther than the normal relationship between humans and their pets. The short \"Is My Palm Read\" contains a scene in which Betty is shown as a child between the ages of four and five, bathing in the nude. In the 1970s, this scene was shown out of context in performances by The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo. Concert audiences were not aware that Betty was supposed to be a baby in the sequence.\n\nAnother short, \"Bamboo Isle\", contains a sequence in which Betty dances the hula topless, wearing only a lei over her breasts and a grass skirt. According to animator Shamus Culhane, Fleischer Studios and Paramount Pictures were shocked by the sequence, but because it was a major sequence, it could not be cut out of the film. Culhane also states that he does not remember any instance in which the film was censored. Betty’s hula animation was reused for a cameo appearance with Popeye the Sailor in his self-titled animated debut short.\n\nFollowing the enforcement of the Hays Code, Betty's clothing was redesigned, and all future shorts portrayed her with a longer dress which did not portray her physique and sexuality. Shorts produced following the enforcement of the Hays Code were also less surreal in nature, and Betty was portrayed as a rational adult.\n\nBy 1968, the Hays Office had been eliminated, and the former guidelines were replaced by the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system. The lifting of the Code meant that animated features from other countries could be distributed without censorship, and that censorship would not be required for American productions. Some underground cartoon features from the late 1960s were also aimed at an adult audience, such as \"Bambi Meets Godzilla\" (1968), and the anti-war films \"Escalation\" (1968), and \"Mickey Mouse in Vietnam\" (1969). \"Escalation\" in particular is interesting because it was made by Disney animator Ward Kimball, independently from the Disney Studios. Film producer John Magnuson completed an animated short based upon an audio recording of a comedy routine by Lenny Bruce titled \"Thank You Mask Man\" (1971), in which The Lone Ranger shocks the residents of the town he saves when he tells them that he wants to have sex with Tonto. The short was made by San Francisco-based company Imagination, Inc. and directed by Jeff Hale, a former member of the National Film Board of Canada. The film was scheduled to premiere on the opening night of \"Z\", as a supplement preceding the main feature, but was not shown. According to a former staff member of the festival, Magnuson ran up the aisle and shouted \"They crucified Lenny when he was alive and now that he is dead they are screwing him again!\" The festival's director told Magnuson that the producer of \"Z\" did not want any short shown that night. Rumors suggested that the wife of one of the festival's financiers hated Bruce, and threatened to withdraw her husband's money if the short was screened. \"Thank You Mask Man\" was later shown in art house screenings, and gained a following, but screenings did not perform well enough financially for Magnuson to profit from the film.\n\nBy the late-1960s, animator Ralph Bakshi felt that he could not continue to produce the same kind of animation as he had in the past. Bakshi was quoted in a 1971 article for the \"Los Angeles Times\" as saying that the idea of \"grown men sitting in cubicles drawing butterflies floating over a field of flowers, while American planes are dropping bombs in Vietnam and kids are marching in the streets, is ludicrous.\" With producer Steve Krantz, Bakshi founded his own studio, Bakshi Productions, establishing the studio as an alternative to mainstream animation by producing animation his own way and accelerating the advancement of female and minority animators. He also paid his employees a higher salary than any other studio at that time.\n\nIn 1969, Ralph's Spot was founded as a division of Bakshi Productions to produce commercials for Coca-Cola and \"Max, the 2000-Year-Old Mouse\", a series of educational shorts paid for by Encyclopædia Britannica. However, Bakshi was uninterested in the kind of animation he was producing, and wanted to produce something personal. Bakshi soon developed \"Heavy Traffic\", a tale of inner-city street life. However, Krantz told Bakshi that studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi's lack of film experience. While browsing the East Side Book Store on St. Mark's Place, Bakshi came across a copy of Robert Crumb's \"Fritz the Cat\". Impressed by Crumb's sharp satire, Bakshi purchased the book and suggested to Krantz that it would work as a film.\n\n\"Fritz the Cat\" was the first animated film to receive an X rating from the MPAA, and the highest grossing independent animated film of all time. While the film is widely noted in its innovation for featuring content that had not been portrayed in American animation before, such as explicit sexuality and violence, the film also offered commercial potential for alternative and independent animated films in the United States, as the film offered a mature, satirical portrayal of the 1960s, including portrayal of drug use, political tension and race relations. Bakshi has been credited for playing an important role in establishing animation as a medium where any story can be told, rather than a medium for children. As a result of the acceptance of Bakshi's features, the director suggested that \"War and Peace\" could be produced as an animated film.\n\nBecause of the perception that \"Fritz the Cat\" was pornographic, Krantz attempted to appeal the film's rating, but the MPAA refused to hear the appeal. Praise from \"Rolling Stone\" and \"The New York Times\", and the film's acceptance into the 1972 Cannes Film Festival cleared up previous misconceptions. Bakshi then simultaneously directed a number of animated films, starting with \"Heavy Traffic\". Krantz was nervous about showing too much nudity and sexual content, and had several versions of some scenes animated. Thanks to \"Heavy Traffic\", Bakshi became the first person in the animation industry since Walt Disney to have two financially successful films released back-to-back. Although the film was critically praised, it was banned by the film censorship board in the province of Alberta, Canada when it was originally released.\n\nBakshi's next film, \"Coonskin\" was produced by Albert S. Ruddy. The film, culled from Bakshi's interest in African-American history in America, was an attack on racism and racist stereotypes. Bakshi hired several African-American animators to work on \"Coonskin\" and another feature, \"Hey Good Lookin'\", including Brenda Banks, the first African-American female animator. After the release was stalled by protests from the Congress of Racial Equality, which accused both the film and Bakshi himself of being racist, the film was given limited distribution, advertised as an exploitation film, and soon disappeared from theaters.\n\nBakshi avoided controversy by producing fantasy films, including \"Wizards\", \"The Lord of the Rings\" and \"Fire and Ice\". Bakshi did not produce another animated feature film after the 1992 release of \"Cool World\". In 2015, after securing funding through a Kickstarter campaign, he released the short film \"Last Days of Coney Island\" on the internet.\n\nAlthough some adult-oriented animated films achieved success, very few animation studios in the United States produced explicitly adult animation during the 1970s, and much of the adult-oriented animation produced in the 1980s and 1990s was critically and commercially unsuccessful. Krantz produced \"The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat\" without Bakshi's involvement, and it was released in June 1974 to negative reviews. Charles Swenson developed \"Down and Dirty Duck\" as a project for Flo and Eddie (Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman, formerly of The Turtles and The Mothers of Invention) under the title \"Cheap!\" The film, produced by Roger Corman, was released on June 13, 1977 under the title \"Dirty Duck\", and received negative reviews. \n\nHowever, in 1987, Italian-Canadian cartoonist Danny Antonucci, who would later create the television series \"Ed, Edd n Eddy\" for Cartoon Network, released a successful short film titled \"Lupo the Butcher\". The short follows the story of a psychotic, temperamental butcher who swears at his meat when the smallest things go wrong. Produced by Marv Newland's International Rocketship Limited, \"Lupo the Butcher\" has become a cult following and opened floodgates to irreverent adult animated series.\n\nAnimated films portraying serious stories began to regain notice from mainstream audiences in the beginning of the 21st century. \"Persepolis\", a 2007 adaptation of Marjane Satrapi's autobiographical graphic novel, won the Jury Prize at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival and was later nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. The Iranian government protested the film's inclusion in the Festival, but later allowed the film to be screened in a censored version, which altered the film's sexual content. The 2008 Israeli film \"Waltz with Bashir\", an animated documentary involving the 1982 Lebanon War, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nThe 2016 film \"\" was the first film in the DC Universe Animated Original Movies series and the first animated Batman film to receive an R rating from the MPAA, with Warner Bros. Animation president Sam Register explaining, \"From the start of production, we encouraged producer Bruce Timm and our team at Warner Bros. Animation to remain faithful to the original story—regardless of the eventual MPAA rating... We felt it was our responsibility to present our core audience—the comics-loving community—with an animated film that authentically represented the tale they know all too well.\" The film was released in a limited theatrical screening on July 25, 2016. \"Sausage Party\", released in 2016, became the first CGI film to be rated R by the MPAA. It grossed over $140 million worldwide, becoming the most successful R-rated animated film of all time.\n\nIn 1988, San Francisco exhibitor Expanded Cinema screened a compilation of adult-oriented animated shorts under the title \"Outrageous Animation\". Advertising the package as containing \"the wildest cartoons ever\", the screenings contained shorts produced outside the United States, as well as independently produced American shorts. Reviews of the festival were mixed. \"San Francisco Chronicle\" writer Mick LaSalle hated almost everything screened at the festival, with the exception of Bill Plympton's \"One of Those Days\". In \"The San Francisco Examiner\", David Armstrong gave the show a three-star review and described the films screened as having \"some of the rude vitality of the great old Warner Bros. cartoons —and a good deal of the sexual explicitness denied those old favorites from a more cautious age.\"\n\nIn 1990, Mellow Manor Productions began screening films under the title \"Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation\". Founders Craig \"Spike\" Decker and Mike Gribble promoted their festival by handing out flyers on the streets rather than with traditional promotional techniques. In 1991, Decker and Gribble screened their first \"All Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation\", promising \"wild and zany films that could never be shown to our 'normal audience'\". The festival screened newer independent shorts, as well as older shorts such as \"Bambi Meets Godzilla\", and \"Thank You Mask Man\". Although the festival promoted works by animators who would later gain mainstream success, such as Bill Plympton, Mike Judge, Trey Parker and Don Hertzfeldt, many reviewers dismissed the bulk of the programming as shock value.\n\nIn 2003, Judge and Hertzfeldt created a new touring festival of animation marketed towards adults and college students. The Animation Show brought animated shorts into more North American theaters than any previous commercial festival.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1974, Hanna-Barbera produced \"Wait Till Your Father Gets Home\", an adult-oriented sitcom in the style of \"All in the Family\". The series dealt with subjects such as feminism and the generation gap.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, a number of animated television programs appeared which challenged the Standards & Practices guidelines, including \"The Simpsons\", \"Beavis and Butt-Head\", \"The Critic\", \"The Brothers Grunt\" and \"Duckman\".\n\n\"The Tracey Ullman Show\" aired in prime time, therefore it was not censored as much as programs intended to air on Saturday mornings. In addition to the show's portrayal of brief nudity and mild language, the series has dealt with mature themes and subjects such as death, gambling addiction, religion and suicide.\n\nIn 1989, \"The Simpsons\" began airing on Fox Broadcasting Company in prime time, becoming a massive hit among American audiences. In response, ABC, CBS and NBC each developed animated series to air in prime time, but none of the shows were successful. One series, \"Capitol Critters\", focused on subjects such as gun control, interracial violence and political corruption. In his review of the series, \"Variety\" critic Brian Lowry wrote that he felt that the series' approach was \"muddled\", and that \"the bland central character and cartoonish elements [...] will likely be off-putting to many adults, who won't find the political satire biting enough to merit their continued attention. Similarly, kids probably won't be as smitten with the cartoon aspects or look\". The series was cancelled after one month. \"The Critic\" was somewhat more successful, but achieved low ratings because of ABC's sporadic scheduling, and was cancelled by the network. Fox picked up the series, but cancelled it four months later. While Fox allowed \"The Simpsons\" to portray animated depictions of human buttocks, ABC would not allow similar scenes to appear on \"The Critic\".\n\n\"Beavis and Butt-head\" was controversial for its portrayal of brief nudity, profanity and violence. Although the series was intended for adult audiences, it was shown in the afternoons, and multiple parents claimed that their children had imitated the show's characters. The first instance of such an accusation occurred when animal lovers in Santa Cruz, California claimed that someone had blown up a cat after seeing Beavis and Butt-head perform this act on television. In actuality, no such scene had ever been portrayed. When a five-year-old boy in Ohio set his bed on fire, killing his two-year-old sister, critics claimed that the incident was the result of an episode involving fire, although it has never been proven that the boy had ever watched the series. MTV responded by moving the series to a later airtime and adding disclaimers to future episodes stating explicitly not to imitate the actions of the characters, as well as removing all references to fire from the episodes.\n\nDiscussions involving a series based upon Trey Parker and Matt Stone's video Christmas card, \"The Spirit of Christmas\", led HBO to contact Ralph Bakshi in order to produce an animated series targeted specifically toward adults. Bakshi enlisted a team of writers, including his son, Preston, to develop \"[Spicy Detective\", later renamed \"Spicy City\", an anthology series set in a noir-ish, technology-driven future. Each episode featuring a different story narrated by a female host named Raven, voiced by Michelle Phillips. The series premiered in July 1997, beating \"South Park\" to television by over a month and becoming the first \"adults only\" cartoon series. Although critical reaction was mixed and largely unfavorable, \"Spicy City\" received acceptable ratings. A second season was approved, but the network wanted to fire Bakshi's writing team and hire professional Los Angeles screenwriters. When Bakshi refused to cooperate with the network, the series was canceled.\n\nIn 2001, Time Warner established Adult Swim as a programming block on Cartoon Network, aimed for an adult audience. Its schedule currently includes original programs such as \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force\", \"Squidbillies\" and \"Rick and Morty\", and reruns of syndicated programs such as \"Family Guy\", \"American Dad!\" and \"King of the Hill\" (all of which had their original run on Fox).\n\nAmerican audiences have become more accepting of adult-oriented animation through the popularity of American-produced comedic television shows. Dramatic series such as \"Aeon Flux\" and \"Invasion America\" are less common, and still rarely successful.\n\nIn 1954, a British film studio produced an animated adaptation of George Orwell's novel \"Animal Farm\". This film is believed to have been one of the earliest examples of British animation, and like the book is meant to be a portrayal or critique of Stalinism with characters serving as analogues to figures from the Russian Revolution of 1917.\n\nFor many years, it had been problematic to import films that did not meet the approval of the United States Customs Service. In 1972, the Customs Service refused entry of a short film titled \"Sinderella\", depicting scenes of sexual intercourse between characters based upon \"Cinderella\", \"Little Red Riding Hood\", \"Puss in Boots\", \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\" and \"Prince Charming\". The film was seized as obscene material, and its distributor filed a court case and an appeal in 1974, but lost both.\n\nIn 1973, Rene Laloux directed \"La Planète sauvage\" based on the French science fiction novel \"Oms en série\" by Stefan Wul. It has been televised in the United States and United Kingdom as \"Fantastic Planet\", and several DVD editions have been released. Also in 1973, an Italian film, \"King Dick\", was released and became a cult classic in the United Kingdom. A West German short called \"Snow White and the Seven Perverts\" (\"Schneeflittchen unter die Sieben Bergen\") also appeared. This little film mostly parodies Snow White and has been included as part of other compilation films.\n\nThe first foreign animated feature to receive both an X rating and wide distribution in the United States was \"\". A dubbed version, which featured new dialogue performed by American actors and comedians such as John Belushi, Adolph Caesar, Brian Doyle-Murray, Judy Graubart, Bill Murray and Johnny Weissmuller Jr., received an R rating. According to distributor Stuart S. Shapiro, the X rating hurt the film's distribution, but the dubbed version \"took the bite out of the film. It lost its outrageousness.\" \"Tarzoon\" was banned by the New Zealand Board of Censors in 1980.\n\nIn England, Martin Rosen directed two animated features based on the novels of Richard Adams: \"Watership Down\" in 1978, and \"The Plague Dogs\" in 1982. Both films deal with adult themes: \"Watership Down\", the negotiation of leadership to organize an exodus away from persecution, and \"The Plague Dogs\" on animal testing.\n\n\"Pink Floyd – The Wall\", an adaptation of Pink Floyd's concept album of the same name, featured fifteen minutes of painstaking traditional animation in addition to numerous live-action sequences; although the film was not by any stretch pornographic, it was an adult film (with numerous references to drugs, mental illness and sex, along with one animated sequence portraying a character talking out of his rectum and having a scrotum for a beard) and received an R rating when imported to the United States.\nIn 1986, England produced yet another politically-themed animation, \"When the Wind Blows\", about an older couple whose home undergoes a nuclear attack.\n\n\"Werner\" - a German animated film based on the comic book. In an episode of many characters use profanity and flip the bird.\n\n\"Felidae\" is a 1994 German animated neo-noir crime film based on Akif Pirinçci's 1989 novel of the same name. It features graphic violent and sexual content involving animals.\n\nSoyuzmultfilm produced children's animation as well as animations aimed more at adults, such as Film, Film, Film, a satirical animation about the film industry in the Soviet Union, and Pomorskaya Byl, a serious account of the death of two Pomor fishermen, stranded in the middle of the White Sea.\n\nAdult animation is known in Japan as (adult anime). In both English and Japanese, the word \"adult\" may carry connotations of a sexual nature, but anime on serious topics such as \"Akira\" or \"Ghost in the Shell\" often get referred to as \"adult\" in Japan as well, even when sex is not a key part of the story.\n\nAnimated works of an erotic nature have come to be described in western fandom as \"hentai\", the Japanese word for \"perverted\", while in Japan they are more likely to be referred to as (R-18 anime) or (erotic anime). Although some associate all anime with sexual content, hentai only makes up a very small portion of the Japanese animation industry. As the result of the misconceptions about Japanese animation, some video stores outside Japan have classified children's anime as for adults only. Many video stores have also categorized all adult-oriented animation as anime, including the works of Ralph Bakshi, the French animated film \"Fantastic Planet\", the Canadian animated film \"Heavy Metal\" and the HBO television series \"Todd McFarlane's Spawn\". In the case of \"Spawn\", Todd McFarlane directly listed anime as an influence, particularly Katsuhiro Otomo's \"Akira\", and stated his hope that the show would help encourage the rise of adult animation on North American networks. This in part lead to the involvement of the Japanese studio Madhouse in the production, in an attempt to \"combine\" the Eastern and Western styles.\nSome of the earliest manga magazines were aimed at adults, and this provided a prime source as the basis for adult anime works. \"Weekly Manga Times\" began publication in 1956, and would be followed by \"Weekly Manga Goraku\" (1964), and \"Manga Action\" (1967). Anime works based on adult manga include \"Berserk\", \"Hellsing Ultimate\", \"Maison Ikkoku\", \"Mushishi\", \"Golden Boy\" and \"Tokyo Daigaku Monogatari\".\nIn 1969, Osamu Tezuka and Eiichi Yamamoto released \"Senya Ichiya Monogatari\" (千夜一夜物語) the first of a series of three animated feature films aimed at an adult audience. It was dubbed and released in the United States as \"One Thousand and One Arabian Nights\". Osamu Tezuka and Eiichi Yamamoto collaborated on the second film in the Animerama series \"Kureopatora\" (クレオパトラ) released in the United States as \"Cleopatra: Queen of Sex\". The third film \"Kanashimi no Beradonna\" (哀しみのベラドンナ) was directed by Eiichi Yamamoto alone. It was entered in the Berlin International Film Festival, but did not achieve commercial success.\nIn 1984, original video animation (OVA) of an erotic nature began to be released, first \"Lolita Anime\" by Wonder Kids based on the manga work of Fumio Nakajima, and then later in the year \"Cream Lemon\", a series which proved to be a big hit in Japan. \"La Blue Girl\" and \"New Angel\" are two other erotic anime to be released in United States and Europe in the early 1990s.\n\n1988 saw the release of \"Akira\" directed by Katsuhiro Otomo which was dubbed and shown in North American theaters, and released on VHS around the world. Its success led to a greater interest in Japanese adult anime in the US, and opened the door for other titles. In 1995, \"Ghost in the Shell\" was released as a feature film, directed by Mamoru Oshii based on the manga by Masamune Shirow. It received critical acclaim in both Japan, and abroad hinting further at the possibilities of adult animation.\nThe North American Adult Swim channel has been airing adult-oriented anime series on Saturday nights: \"Cowboy Bebop\", \"FLCL\", \"\", \"IGPX\" and \"Space Dandy\". Four of the Japanese TV networks have similar late night anime blocks: Fuji Television's \"Noitamina\", Mainichi Broadcasting System's \"Animeism and Anime Shower\", Asahi Broadcasting Corporation's \"Wednesday Anime\" and Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation's \"Manpa\". The programs aired have included \"Angel Heart\", \"Genji Monogatari Sennenki\" and \"Hellsing\".\n\nStarting in 2004, Mahiro Maeda directed a multi-episode anime adaptation of Alexandre Dumas' novel as \"\". It was aired on Animax in Asia, and FUNimation in the United States, and received critical acclaim in the anime press.\n\n\n"}

Its members practice all forms of communication design, including graphic design, typography, interaction design, branding and identity. The organization's aim is to be the standard bearer for professional ethics and practices for the design profession. There are currently over 22,000 members and 73 chapters, and more than 200 student groups around the United States.\n\nIn 1911, Frederic Goudy, Alfred Stieglitz, and W. A. Dwiggins came together to discuss the creation of an organization that was committed to individuals passionate about communication design. In 1913, president of the National Arts Club, John G. Agar, announced the formation of The American Institute of Graphic Arts during the eighth annual exhibition of “The Books of the Year.” The National Arts Club was instrumental in the formation of AIGA in that they helped to form the committee to plan to organize the organization. The committee formed included Charles DeKay and William B. Howland and officially formed the American Institute of Graphic Arts in 1914. Howland, publisher and editor of \"The Outlook\", was elected president. The goal of the group was to promote excellence in the graphic design profession through its network of local chapters throughout the country.\n\nIn 1920, AIGA began awarding medals to \"individuals who have set standards of excellence over a lifetime of work or have made individual contributions to innovation within the practice of design.\" Winners have been recognized for design, teaching, writing or leadership of the profession and may honor individuals posthumously.\n\nIn 1982, the New York Chapter was formed and the organization began creating local chapters to decentralize leadership.\n\nRepresented by Washington, D.C. arts advocate and attorney, James Lorin Silverberg, Esq., The Washington, D.C. Chapter of AIGA, was organized as the American Institute of Graphic Arts, Incorporated, Washington, D.C. on September 6, 1984.\n\nThe AIGA, in collaboration with the US Department of Transportation, produced 50 standard symbols to be used on signs \"in airports and other transportation hubs and at large international events\". The first 34 symbols were published in 1974, receiving a Presidential Design Award. The remaining 16 designs were added in 1979.\n\nIn 2012, AIGA replaced all its competitions with a single competition called \"Cased\" (formerly called \"Justified\"). The stated aim of the competition is to demonstrate \"the collective success and impact of the design profession by celebrating the best in contemporary design through case studies\".\n\nBetween 1941 and 2011 AIGA sponsored a juried contest for the 50 best designed books published in the previous year, entitled \"50 Books/50 Covers\". Jurors included booksellers, book publishers, and designers such as George Salter.\n\nOn February 17, 2012, AIGA announced that it would cease organizing the contest and that future contests would be organized by Design Observer. This move has been criticized.\n\nThe 365 was an annual design competition for all graphic design other than book design. The last “365” competition was organized in 2011, after which it was replaced by the \"Cased\" competition.\n\nAIGA organized two conferences, the AIGA Design Conference and GAIN: AIGA Design and Business Conference. Both conferences were held biennially and the two were held in alternating years. Beginning in 2016, the AIGA Design Conference will be held annually with the 2016 conference held in Las Vegas.\n\nThe first AIGA Design Conference took place in Boston, Massachusetts in 1985.\n\nPast AIGA Design Conferences include:\n\n\nThe 2016 and 2017 conferences was hosted by Roman Mars.\n\nAs of 2018, the national board consists of\n\nBetween 2005 and 2009, AIGA was briefly a member of Icograda (now called Ico-D). In 2010, it withdrew from the international organization, citing financial reasons.\n\nAIGA opened up membership beyond local chapters in 2014, benefiting creative professionals living and working outside of the USA.\n\nIn 1947 AIGA started publishing the \"AIGA Journal of Graphic Design\" (ISSN 0736-5322), which in 2000 was renamed \"Trace: AIGA Journal of Design\" (ISSN 1471-3497). The journal ceased publication in 2003.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2003 AIGA published \"Loop: AIGA Journal of Interaction Design Education\", an “interactive, web-based” research journal on interaction and visual interface design co-sponsored by Virginia Commonwealth University’s Center for Design Studies.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2011 AIGA published \"Voice: AIGA Journal of Design\", “an online publication for the discussion of design matters” listing Steven Heller as its editor.

The film had a theatrical release on January 16, 2015 in the US and was released on March 6, 2015 in the UK.\n\nBrooklynite Shirin, the daughter of well-off Persian immigrants, is left homeless and jobless after her girlfriend Maxine breaks up with her. With the encouragement of her friend Crystal she moves in with strange roommates and gets a new job teaching 5 year old Park Slope children the art of movie making.\n\nShirin's parents are confused as to why Shirin moved out of her old apartment as Shirin has never told them she was bisexual and dating a woman. Determined to get her life back on track, Shirin begins trying to follow Maxine, hoping to rekindle their relationship. Maxine begins dating Tibet, a fellow teacher at the Park Slope school where she works. Shirin devotes herself to her work and comes out to her brother, who is mostly supportive, and her mother, who is in denial.\n\nOn the subway, Shirin tells Crystal that she again plans to bring up the issue of her sexuality with her mother in a month. She sees Maxine outside the subway car on the platform and the two women wave to one another.\n\n\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports a 98% of positive responses from the critics. On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 reviews from film critics, the film holds an average score of '75', based on 16 reviews, indicating a 'generally favorable' response.\n\nDavid Rooney in his review for \"The Hollywood Reporter\" praised the film by saying that \"The promise of fresh cultural perspectives gives way to a more amorphous slice of contemporary romantic angst comedy.\" Ryan Gilbey wrote in the \"New Statesman\" that Akhavan is \"a whiz at writing characters whose life seems to extend beyond their brief screentime.\" Katie Walsh of \"Indiewire\" grade the film B+ by saying that \"Funny, unique, and entirely inappropriate, Appropriate Behavior is a supremely satisfying and irreverent take on the New York rom-com.\"\n\n"}

Also called \"servile\" and \"vulgar\", from antiquity they had been deemed unbecoming for a free man, as ministering to baser needs.\n\nJohannes Scotus Eriugena (9th century) divides them somewhat arbitrarily into seven parts: \n\nIn his \"Didascalicon\", Hugh of St Victor (12th century) includes navigation, medicine and theatrical arts instead of commerce, agriculture and cooking. Hugh's treatment somewhat elevates the mechanical arts as ordained to the improvement of humanity, a promotion which was to represent a growing trend among late medievals.\n\nThe classification of the \"Artes Mechanicae\" as applied geometry was introduced to Western Europe by Dominicus Gundissalinus (12th century) under the influence of his readings in Arabic scholarship.\n\nIn the 19th century \"mechanic arts\" referred to fields of which some are now known as engineering. Use of the term was apparently an attempt to distinguish these fields from creative and artistic endeavors like the performing arts and the fine arts which were for the upper class of the time, and the intelligentsia. The mechanic arts were also considered practical fields for those that did not come from good families.\n\nRelated phrases, \"useful arts,\" or \"applied arts\" probably encompass the mechanic arts as well as craftsmanship in general.\n\nThe most famous usage of the term \"mechanic arts\" (and the one in which it is most commonly encountered today) is in the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act.\n\n\n"}

It is a literary device of a narrative history all chronologically earlier than the narrative of primary interest. \n\nIn acting, it is the history of the character before the drama begins, and is created during the actor's preparation. \n\nIt is the history of characters and other elements that underlie the situation existing at the main narrative's start. Even a purely historical work selectively reveals backstory to the audience.\n\nAs a literary device, backstory is often employed to lend depth or believability to the main story. The usefulness of having a dramatic revelation was recognized by Aristotle, in \"Poetics\".\n\nBackstories are usually revealed, partially or in full, chronologically or otherwise, as the main narrative unfolds. However, a story creator may also create portions of a backstory or even an entire backstory that is solely for their own use.\n\nBackstory may be revealed by various means, including flashbacks, dialogue, direct narration, summary, recollection, and exposition. The original \"Star Wars\" movie and its first two sequels are examples of a work with a preconceived backstory, which was later released as the \"prequel\" second set of three movies.\n\nRecollection is the fiction-writing mode whereby a character calls something to mind, or remembers it. A character's memory plays a role for conveying backstory, as it allows a fiction-writer to bring forth information from earlier in the story or from before the beginning of the story. Although recollection is not widely recognized as a distinct fiction-writing mode, recollection is commonly used by authors of fiction.\n\nFor example, Orson Scott Card observes that \"If it's a memory the character could have called to mind at any point, having her think about it just in time to make a key decision may seem like an implausible coincidence . . . .\" Furthermore, \"If the memory is going to prompt a present decision, then the memory in turn must have been prompted by a recent event.\"\n\nIn a shared universe more than one author may shape the same backstory. The later creation of a backstory that conflicts with a previously written main story may require the adjustment device known as retroactive continuity, informally known as \"retcon\".\n\nActors may create their own backstories for characters, going beyond the sometimes meager information in a script. Filling in details helps an actor interpret the script and create fully imagined characters.\n\n"}

{"id": "858756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=858756", "title": "Bogan", "text": "Bogan\n\nBogan ( ) is Australian and New Zealand slang for a person whose speech, clothing, attitude and behaviour are considered unrefined or unsophisticated. Depending on the context, the term can be pejorative or self-deprecating. The prevalence of the term bogan has also been associated with changing social attitudes towards social class in Australia. Specifically, the term has been related to the decline of masculine conceptions of meritocracy in Australia, and a growing ambivalence towards traditional sites of working class culture. \n\nSince the 1980s, the bogan has become a very well-recognised subculture, often as an example of bad taste. It has antecedents in the Australian larrikin and ocker, and various localised names exist that describe the same or very similar people to the bogan.\n\nThe origin of the term \"bogan\" is unclear; both the \"Macquarie Dictionary\" and the \"Australian Oxford Dictionary\" cite the origin as unknown. Some Sydney residents' recollection is that the term is based on the concept that residents of the Western Suburbs (stereotyped as \"Westies\") displayed what are now termed \"bogan\" characteristics and that an individual who displayed these characteristics to a strong extent was as \"west\" as the Bogan River in western New South Wales. According to another anecdote, the term emerged in Melbourne's outer-western and outer-eastern suburbs in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nThe term became widely known in the late 1980s when the teenage character Kylie Mole (played by Mary-Anne Fahey), in the Australian sketch comedy television series \"The Comedy Company\", frequently used the term to disparage anyone she disliked. The same program included a sketch about a magazine called \"Bogue\" (a parody of \"Vogue\"), which featured traditional bogans. Merrick and Rosso (from Melbourne) also used the term on their Triple J national radio show.\n\nThe Australian National Dictionary Centre (ANDC) included the word in its Australian dictionary project in 1991 and said the earliest use they found was in the September 1985 issue of surfing magazine \"Tracks\": \"So what if I have a Mohawk and wear Dr. Martens (boots for all you uninformed bogans)?\"\n\nThere are places in western New South Wales that contain \"bogan\" in their name—for example Bogan Shire, the Bogan River and the rural village of Bogan Gate. Bogan Gate, for example, is derived from the local Aboriginal word meaning \"the birthplace of a notable headman of the local tribe\". Residents of streets such as Bogan Place and Bogan Road have been moved to action by the negative connotations of their street names and lobbied to rename them, prompting Ku-ring-gai mayor Nick Ebbeck to joke that he was a bit of a bogan himself. The 1902 poem \"City of Dreadful Thirst\" by Australian poet Banjo Paterson makes reference to a \"Bogan shower\" as a term meaning \"three raindrops and some dust\", although this is likely a reference to the dry area around the Bogan River. Makeshift gates in a rural fence in northwest NSW were known as \"bogan gates\" at least as early as the 1960s.\n\nSome features regularly associated with the bogan stereotype include residing in the outer suburbs of larger cities, having teeth that haven't had dental care due to cost, having an anti-authoritarian or jingoistic stance, as well as being interested in classic rock music, hoon driving and excessive alcohol consumption.\n\nCertain types of clothing are stereotypically associated with bogans, including flannelette shirts, hoodies, Stubbies shorts, King Gee workwear, ugg boots, jeans and black leggings.\n\nVehicles such as the Holden Commodore and Ford Falcon, particularly modified or poorly maintained examples, also have similar associations.\n\nA person described as a bogan may refuse to conform to middle-class standards of taste, dietary habits, leisure activities, styles of dress and ways of speaking, and might be looked down upon by some groups due to preconceived perceptions and biases which can often make the lives of disadvantaged people much tougher.\n\nMel Campbell argued in a 2006 article in the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" that bogan (including \"cashed-up bogan\") is a nebulous, personal concept that is frequently used in a process by which \"we use the idea of the bogan to quarantine ideas of Australianness that alarm or discomfort us. It's a way of erecting imaginary cultural barriers between 'us' and 'them'.\" Campbell argues that though many people believe they know exactly what a bogan is and what their characteristics might be, there is no defined set of characteristics of a bogan: the speaker imagines the denoted person to be different from, and less cultured than, themselves. Campbell considered \"cashed-up bogan\" to be a \"stupid term\". A similar argument is made by David Nichols, author of \"The Bogan Delusion\" (2011), who says that people have \"created this creature that is a lesser human being to express their interclass hatred\".\n\nBy the 21st century, the term bogan came to be employed more favourably to indicate a pride in being rough around the edges. In 2002, Michelle Griffin discussed the fact that 'bogan' is no longer just being used as an insult, but is in fact a way to identify with the 'Aussie' culture that many Anglo‐Saxon Australian citizens are proud of. In the past, bogan was a term of disdain, but nowadays it has become 'cool' to be a bogan. Radio station Triple J held a \"National Bogan Day\" on 28 June 2002, which they commemorated by playing music by rock bands such as Cold Chisel, Midnight Oil, Rose Tattoo and AC/DC. In a 2011 study, linguistics students at the University of Auckland found that the term was likely to be thought of as positive by people under the age of 30, compared with over-30s who generally felt it was more of a negative term.\n\nThe typical bogan has been portrayed on television in shows such as \"Outrageous Fortune\", \"Bogan Hunters\", \"Pizza\", \"Housos\", \"Bogan Pride\", \"Kath & Kim\", and \"Upper Middle Bogan\".\n\nIn the 2016 film \"Suicide Squad\", DC Comics villain Captain Boomerang—a classically Australian character—has been reinvented as a bogan instead of his typical garish personality.\n\nThe popular website (and 2010 bestselling book) \"Things Bogans Like\" contains 250 articles on various things that bogans are claimed to like, and suggests that a \"bogan today defies income, class, race, creed, gender and logic\".\n\nIn 2007 Microsoft deemed \"bogan\" to be one of twenty colloquialisms most relevant to Australian users when the word was added to the dictionary of Microsoft Office 2007. The word entered the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" in June 2012.\n\nThe word \"bogan\" attracts negative attention online towards Anglo-Australians, and consequently boganbroadcast is actively campaigning to reclaim the term in a positive way.\n\nAn app known as \"The Bogan Test\" has been created to examine a person's likelihood to fall within the boundaries of the bogan category.\n\nAustralian ska-punk band Area-7 achieved one of their biggest hits with the song \"Nobody Likes A Bogan\", released in 2002.\n\n\"CUB\" or \"cashed up bogan\", was used by one marketing researcher in 2006 to describe people of a blue-collar background now earning a high salary and spending their earnings on expensive consumer items as a matter of conspicuous consumption. The media have cited tennis player Lleyton Hewitt and his actress wife, Bec Cartwright, as examples. Subsequently, the Kaesler Winery, in the Barossa Valley, released a Shiraz wine under the name Bogan.\n\nRoz Rohen has described the term 'bogan' as peerless, and that it warrants acceptance as an Australian keyword.\nAlthough the term \"bogan\" is understood across Australia and New Zealand, certain regions have their own slang terms for the same group of people. These terms include:\n\n\n\"Westie\" or \"westy\" is not synonymous with bogan, although westies are often stereotyped as being bogans. \"Westie\" predates bogan, originating in Sydney in the 1970s to refer to people from that city's western suburbs. As Sydney's western suburbs are predominantly working class blue collar areas, the term connotes a predominantly working class blue collar person – someone with little education, little taste, and very limited horizons. \"Westie\" is now in wide use in many cities and towns across both Australia and New Zealand, where it especially refers to the denizens of West Auckland.\n\n\nInternational:\n\nConcepts:\n\n"}

Erected in the Byzantine era, its original dedication is unknown. In the Ottoman era the small edifice, being dedicated to St. Nicholas of Myra, was known as Agios Nikólaos tou Bogdansarághi (). and was part of the Istanbul residence of the Moldavian \"hospodar\"′s legation to the Ottoman Porte. The building - whose parts above ground have almost completely disappeared - is a minor example of Byzantine architecture in Constantinople.\n\nThe remains of the church lie in Istanbul, in the district of Fatih, in the neighborhood () of Salmatomruk, not far from Edirnekapı (the ancient Gate of Charisius), 250 m. east of the museum of Chora and 100 m north of the Kefeli Mosque, both former Byzantine religious buildings. The ruins of the edifice are hardly accessible, as of 2012, as they are enclosed in a tire shop at \"Draman Caddesi 32\".\n\nThe building was erected on the slope of the sixth hill of Constantinople which overlooks the Golden Horn. Nothing is known about the edifice in the Byzantine Age, but due to its position it was likely an annex of the monastery of \"St. John the Baptist in the Rock\" (, pr. \"Hagios Ioannis Prodromos en ti Petra\"), one of the largest monasteries of Constantinople, where, among other relics, the instruments of the Passion of Christ were kept. Nevertheless, due to its small dimensions it is not likely that the building was the \"katholikon\" (main church) of the monastery. According to some sources it was erected in twelfth century, during the Komnenian age, while for others it is a Palaiologan foundation of the fourteenth century. Its north-south orientation shows that it was originally erected not as a church, but rather as a funerary chapel.\n\nAfter the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453, in sixteenth century the chapel became part of the large land estate bought by the \"hospodar\" of Moldavia to host his envoys in Istanbul, and named accordingly \"Boğdan Sarayi\" (\"Moldavian Palace\"). In this respect, its usage as private chapel of a patrician house represents a rarity in the Ottoman city. At the beginning of the eighteenth century the complex - a coveted property because the high border wall protected it by fires - was leased by the Sultan as residence for several foreign envoys, among them the Swedish ambassadors to the Ottoman Porte P. Strasburg and C. Rolomb, who sojourned in Istanbul in 1634 and 1657/58 respectively. In June 1760 the Phanariote John Callimaches endowed it to the Russian monastery of St. Pantaleon on Mount Athos. The complex burned down in the fire of 1784, and afterward the land was only used as a market garden. The possession of the church by the Athos monastery was confirmed again by relatives of Callimaches in January 1795 and August 1814, but the Russian monks showed little interest in the church's restoration, possibly because of the state of war between the Russian Empire and the Sublime Porte. In the nineteenth century the edifice steadily decayed and after the 1894 Istanbul earthquake fell into ruin. In 1918 a German archaeologist pursued clandestine excavations and found in the crypt three unnamed tombs. In the second half of the 20th century the remains of the building were enclosed in a shanty (), and today—lying inside a tire shop—they are hardly accessible. As of 2012 the parts above ground have almost disappeared, and only the crypt still exists.\n\nThe edifice had a rectangular plan, with sides of 6.20 m and 3.50 m, and was originally composed of two storeys, consisting of an above ground chapel and a subterranean crypt. The chapel was surmounted by a dome with pendentives insisting on two transverse arches across the walls, and ended towards North with a Bema and a polygonal apse adorned externally with niches, while the crypt was surmounted by a barrel vault and had also a simple apse. The edifice's brickwork consisted of courses of three or four rows of white stones alternating with a row of red bricks, obtaining a chromatic effect typical of the late Byzantine period. Its north-south orientation suggests the building's use as a funerary chapel, rather than as a church, since churches in Constantinople were almost always oriented in east-west direction. The attested past existence of remains of walls perpendicular to the structure indicates the possibility that this was part of a larger complex, most likely the monastery of St. John of Petra, one of the largest monasteries of Constantinople.\n\n"}

One definition of business casual states that it includes khaki pants, slacks, and skirts, as well as short-sleeved polo shirts and long-sleeved shirts, but excludes jeans, tennis shoes, tight or short skirts, T-shirts, and sweatshirts. Another source, an American university careers service, states that business casual consists of neutral colors more towards the dark shades of black, gray, navy, but can include white and off white, and reminds that the clothing should be pressed and have clean, crisp seams. The \"Dress for Success\" advice from the University of Toronto sums up business casual as \"a classic, clean cut, and put together look where a full suit is not required,\" which means slacks, khakis, or skirts; blouses, polo shirts, or shirts with collar but no necktie; some sweaters; and closed-toe shoes. The Canadian university ends with the warning that \"it is not clothing you would wear to a club or for athletic purposes... Don’t let the word casual mislead you. You still need to look professional.\"\n\nAnother author wrote in the \"Financial Times\" that \"Ordinarily business casual for guys seems fairly clear.

A U.S. menswear retailer advises men to wear a collared shirt, chinos, navy blazer, and brown shoes, while making sure to look \"clean and well-groomed.\"\n\nA contributor to \"Forbes\" asked her Facebook friends to define business casual, and found a slightly more casual apparent consensus not forcibly including a jacket: \"For men: trousers/khakis and a shirt with a collar. For women: trousers/knee-length skirt and a blouse or shirt with a collar. No jeans. No athletic wear.\" A response to that was \"I disagree. No khakis.\" She states that \"there’s a lack of consensus in what actually defines a business casual wardrobe.

The Byzantine frescoes had been taken from the church of St. Evphemianos in Lysi, Cyprus in the 1980s. In September 2011, the collection announced that the frescos would be permanently returned to Cyprus in February 2012, following the conclusion of a long-term loan agreement with the Greek Orthodox Church of Cyprus. The frescoes had been presented at the museum by agreement with the Church of Cyprus, their owners, but the church decided not to extend the loan further. They will not return to their original home as Lysi is now in Northern Cyprus, but will be displayed at the Byzantine Museum in Nicosia. On March 4, 2012, the Byzantine Fresco Chapel closed, but re-opened in 2015 for the first in a series of site-specific projects.\n\nThe chapel was opened in February 1997, and displayed masterworks from the 13th century—a dome with Christ Pantocrator and an apse depicting the Virgin Mary the Panayia.

The 38 fresco fragments were bought from the thieves by the Houston-based Menil Foundation on behalf of the Church of Cyprus, the rightful owner of the frescoes. The Menil Foundation then funded a careful restoration of the paintings. These intact frescoes were unique in the western hemisphere.\n\nThe major part of the collection consisted of the frescoes of the dome and apse. According to the guide to the museum, \"the Lysi dome represents Christ Pantokrator, 'All sovereign'. It defines a space with no beginning and no end.\" The depiction of Christ gazing directly forward \"has driven time out of space. His gaze is transworldly: not looking but all-seeing.\" By not depicting the Lord below the bust, he is \"universal and ubiquitous.\" Surrounding the figure of Christ is a double row of angels moving towards the throne prepared by God the Father for the Second Coming of Christ. The throne is guarded by the Archangel Michael and Archangel Gabriel and two seraphim. The Virgin Mary leads one line of angels to the throne, while John the Baptist leads the other.\n\nIn the apse, the Virgin was depicted as flanked by the two archangels with a medallion on her breast of the infant Christ, symbolizing the Incarnation of Christ.\n\n\"The Infinity Machine\". This rotating work by Janet Cardiff & George Bures Miller incorporates an array of antique mirrors suspended from above, accompanied by sonic elements made from NASA recordings of solar winds interacting with planetary ionospheres.\n\nThe $4 million building was designed by architect François de Menil. The interior combines rough stone, opaque glass, and rich woods, to create a space that is both art museum and spiritual space. The suspended-glass \"walls\" are not replicas of the chapel that the frescoes were removed from, but created a new context for displaying the icons. In order not to simply replicate the original chapel, de Menil designed \"a mediating external building with an embedded steel structure – a 'reliquary box' – which forms a neutral enclosure for a freestanding chapel,\" according to Christine Slessor in \"The Architectural Review\".\n\nThe Byzantine chapel is oriented to face the cardinal directions – the facades face directly north, south, east and west. The enclosed space measures approximately . There are no windows on the surface area of the building, except for a skylight of of clear, double glazed glass, which permits natural light to pervade the interior. A rough limestone wall on the outside of the building evoked the rough construction of the original chapel in Cyprus.\n\n\n"}

Opus 1841 (Highland Arts Centre Organ)\n\nCasavant Frères Ltée. Opus 1841 is a pipe organ built by the famous Casavant Frères of Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec. The organ was first completed in 1911 as Casavant Brothers - Opus 452 for St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church at 40 Bentinck Street, Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada. St. Andrew's later became St. Andrew's United Church and is now the Highland Arts Theatre.\n\nOpus 1841 is presently composed of 33 speaking stops spread over three manuals and pedals. The 2,045 pipe organ is the largest such instrument on Cape Breton Island. Its facade, casing, pipes, swell and chorus boxes completely fill the apse of the theatre.\n\nOpus 1841 was purchased for the new church, then under construction, in 1911 for $5,395. The original specification was for three manuals, 4 divisions, 29 stops, 27 registers, 29 ranks, 1843 pipes.

Work included three new Choir stops, a new traditional style console with roll top, three manuals, 4 divisions, 33 stops, 30 registers, 32 ranks, 2045 pipes. Manual compass is 61 notes, pedal compass is 32 notes.

Wind is supplied by a 3 hp electric blower located in the basement directly below the organ.\n\nThe 18-ton organ underwent $15,000 in repairs to its bellows in 2008, with the sheep skin seams being replaced by rubberized bellows cloth. The repairs were undertaken by Maritime Pipe Organ Builders Ltd. of Moncton, New Brunswick. The tubular chimes in the Swell Organ, now disconnected, were donated in about 1929 by the Lady's Aid group of the Church. They were activated by an electro-pneumatic action and were dis-connected from the wind supply during repairs to the bellows.\n\nIn February 2017 Organ Tuner Jean-François Mailhot of Sydney Mines spent a week refurbishing Opus 1841, revoicing the reed stops (cleaning the reed tongues and shallots) of the swell organ: the 8' Trompette, the 8' Oboe, and the 4' Clarion, as well as the 16' Trombone of the Pedal Organ. At this time he also repaired a damaged facade pipe, part of the 8' Open Diapason stop of the Great Organ.\n\n\n\nOther organists over the years were:\nHe was succeeded by:\n\nWhile still serving as a church, St. Andrew's was considered to be perhaps the finest concert venue in the city of Sydney. Before its rebirth as an arts centre, the building had a distinguished background as a performance space. St. Andrew's Choir presented many cantatas over the years and massed choirs from eight of Sydney's churches assembled in St. Andrew's to sing as individual choirs and as a group the new and old Christmas carols. Radio broadcasts of Classical musicians regularly held recitals and concerts there over the years because of the building's outstanding acoustical properties and its Casavant Freres organ. In the mid 1950s St. Andrew's was a regular stop for one of the incarnations of the Halifax Symphony Orchestra whose performances at St. Andrew's were broadcast regionally and even nationally by CBC Radio. Thomas Mayer was the conductor. He would often invite local performers to join them, at the time there were several operatic sopranos and mezzo-sopranos from Cape Breton who gained a national following because of these broadcasts. More recently, due to its seating capacity of over 1,000, and excellent acoustics it was sought after by organizations such as Celtic Colours, The Barra MacNeils, and the Cape Breton Chorale.\n\n"}

She has a selfish streak, often more concerned about her own needs than her family's. She often lies and schemes, particularly where men are concerned.\n\nCindy arrives in Albert Square in May 1988, working on her mother's market stall selling hats. She dates barman Simon Wicks (Nick Berry), who is also seeing Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler), leading Cindy and Donna to fight for Simon's attention. However, Cindy grows tired of Simon's womanising, and despite his feelings for her, she moves on to Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), who is becoming a successful entrepreneur. Initially she only wants to make Simon jealous but she and Ian start dating and by February 1989, they announce their engagement. Meanwhile, Simon retaliates by reconciling with Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean). However, while working together late one night at The Queen Victoria public house, Cindy and Simon have sex and Cindy becomes pregnant. She suggests leaving Ian for Simon but he refuses, not wanting to be tied down or upset his family so Cindy marries Ian, letting him think he is the baby's father, giving birth to Steven in December 1989. However, Simon decides he wants to be a father to his son and convinces Cindy to leave Ian, devastating him with the news that Steven is not his son and a feud erupts when he realises Simon is the father. Ian's behaviour grows erratic; after attempting suicide and failing, he chooses to ruin Simon's life instead so Simon decides to leave Walford with Cindy and Steven, leaving Ian heartbroken.\n\nIn 1992, Ian discovers that Simon has abandoned Cindy and Steven. Ian persuades her to return to Walford so he can help her bring Steven up. They reunite and Cindy gets pregnant in 1993. Richard Cole (Ian Reddington) is romantically interested in Cindy but she rejects him, so Richard tells people that he is the father of her twins. Everyone believes him, and Ian and Cindy almost separate but the truth emerges, just before Lucy and Peter are born in December. Married life and motherhood takes its toll on Cindy and she has two affairs, first with Matt, a lifeguard, in 1994, and then with Simon's half-brother, David Wicks (Michael French), also Ian's half-brother, in 1995. Cindy and David meet secretly for a year and she falls in love with David, growing less and less tolerant of Ian. Suspecting Cindy is cheating, Ian hires a private investigator, who films Cindy and David in a clinch. Ian vows to take Cindy to court for custody of their children. David loses interest in Cindy so she takes drastic action and in October 1996, she hires a hitman to kill Ian. Although she changes her mind, it is too late and Ian is shot, collapsing in a pool of blood in front of Cindy. The police suspect Cindy is involved and when David is called in for questioning, Cindy knows she will soon be arrested, so decides to flee with her children. Assisted by David and Barry Evans (Shaun Williamson), she collects her sons, but is unable to get Lucy, and is forced to leave without her. David also stays behind, promising Cindy that he will try to get Lucy and join her later, but he never does.\n\nIan's private investigator tracks Cindy to Italy in 1997. Ian, Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) and Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) find her, and Phil and Grant abduct Steven and Peter while Ian claims he still loves Cindy and will forgive her. Desperate to get her daughter back, Cindy goes along with him but grows suspicious and calls the police, but it is too late. Despite a police chase, Ian brings his sons back to Walford. Cindy soon follows Ian back to Walford with her new boyfriend, Nick Holland (Dominic Taylor). She takes Ian to court for custody of the children and wins. However, moments after the verdict, Cindy is arrested for attempted murder when Ian's associates persuade the hitman to tell the police about Cindy's involvement, so she loses and Ian wins full custody of the children and Cindy is charged and held on remand while she is pregnant by Nick. After realising Cindy is guilty, Nick leaves her in prison without any money for a lawyer. On 5 November 1998, Ian receives news that Cindy has died in childbirth. Her daughter survives and is named Cindy by Ian, in her mother's honour. Custody is given to Cindy's sister, Gina Williams (Nicola Cowper).\n\nCindy was introduced in 1988 in a minor role as a love-interest for Simon Wicks (Nick Berry). She was due to appear in only eleven episodes but the character evolved. Writer Colin Brake has suggested that Cindy was \"the most important character for the future\" to be introduced in 1988, despite her low-key entrance.\n\nActress Michelle Collins was asked to audition for the part by the soap's co-creator, Julia Smith, who saw her perform on stage. Collins had previously auditioned for the role of original character Mary Smith, but at the time Julia Smith had decided they did not want that character to be from London, so that role went to Linda Davidson. Three years on, Collins won the role of Cindy. She has commented, \"Cindy arrived for 11 episodes, working on a hat stall and as a tease for Wicksy, but evolved into a much juicier character. [EastEnders creator] Julia Smith said it would change my life. I didn't believe her - how wrong I was.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2320803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2320803", "title": "Heroic drama", "text": "Heroic drama\n\nHeroic drama is a type of play popular during the Restoration era in England, distinguished by both its verse structure and its subject matter. The subgenre of heroic drama evolved through several works of the middle to later 1660s; John Dryden's \"The Indian Emperour\" (1665) and Roger Boyle's \"The Black Prince\" (1667) were key developments.\n\nThe term \"heroic drama\" was invented by Dryden for his play, \"The Conquest of Granada\" (1670). For the \"Preface\" to the printed version of the play, Dryden argued that the drama was a species of \"epic poetry\" for the stage, that, as the epic was to other poetry, so the heroic drama was to other plays. Consequently, Dryden derived a series of rules for this type of play.\n\nFirst, the play should be composed in heroic verse (closed couplets in iambic pentameter). Second, the play must focus on a subject that pertains to national foundations, mythological events, or important and grand matters. Third, the hero of the heroic drama must be powerful, decisive, and, like Achilles, dominating even when wrong. \"The Conquest of Granada\" followed all of these rules. The story was that of the national foundation of Spain (and King Charles II was known to be fond of Spanish plays), and the hero, Almanzor, was a man of great martial prowess and temperament.\n\nDryden's \"Conquest of Granada\" is often considered one of the better heroic tragedies, but his highest achievement is his adaptation (which he called \"All for Love\", 1678) of Shakespeare's \"Anthony and Cleopatra\" to the heroic formula. Other heroic dramatists were Nathaniel Lee (\"The Rival Queens\") and Thomas Otway, whose \"Venice Preserved\" is a fine tragedy that transcends the usual limitations of the form. We also owe indirectly to heroic tragedy two very amusing parodies of the type: the Duke of Buckingham's \"The Rehearsal\" and Henry Fielding's \"The Tragedy of Tragedies, or the Life and Death of Tom Thumb the Great\"\n\n\"Those who associate 'heroic drama' primarily with the use of the 'heroic couplet' usually set as its extent the years from 1664 to 1678. This, certainly, is its period of fullest development and authority. Those who prefer to accentuate the elements suggested by the very term 'heroic' rather than the strict rhymed verse form are willing to admit wider limits.\" Restoration plays by Sir William Davenant, Thomas Otway, Nathaniel Lee, John Crowne, Elkanah Settle, and John Banks, and later works by Nicholas Rowe and Joseph Addison, have been included in tighter or looser definitions of heroic drama.\n\nToday, drama is divided up into numerous subgenres; Dryden, however, worked from Classical critics. There was little dramatic critical theory for him to appeal to, and the new rules brought over from France (particularly those of Corneille and Boileau) did not match English theatrical history or practice. The emphasis on unities and on maintaining only Classically proscribed dramatic forms also came from Thomas Rymer, who condemned the heterogeneity of the stage. Aristotle had only spoken of satire, epic, and tragedy, and Horace also wrote only of comedy, tragedy and satire, and so Dryden was seeking to square actual theatrical practice with an ancient framework for literature. He was attempting his own neo-classicism. The First Folio of Shakespeare had divided Shakespeare's plays into \"history,\" \"tragedy,\" and \"comedy,\" but these terms were stretched. Dryden, therefore, implicitly recognizes that drama had moved into the territory of other types of poetry, but he strives to restrain that freedom by reforming the stage to a true and epic subject matter. \n\nGeorge Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and others satirized heroic drama in \"The Rehearsal\". The satire was successful enough that heroic drama largely disappeared afterward. Buckingham attacked the stupidity of blustering, military heroes, as well as the apparent self-importance of attempting a dramatic entertainment about the serious subjects of military and national history.\n\nBuckingham's criticism of Dryden in \"The Rehearsal\" is partly Dryden's bombastic verse but, more pointedly, Dryden's \"personal\" interest in creating a \"pure\" drama. The character of Bayes is ludicrous more for his hubris in damning actual plays in favor of imagined ones than he is for being a poetaster.\n"}

The performance is noted for its split narrative with scenes branching to play simultaneously in an expanded performance space. The audience is mobile, able to follow actors and watch scenes as each individual chooses.\n\nAccording to Astrid Ensslin in her book \"Canonizing Hypertext\"(Continuum, London, 2007), the term hyperdrama \"was coined by hyperdramatist and theorist Charles Deemer, who understands 'traditional drama as a special case of hyperdrama' (p27).\" Ensslin places Deemer's one-act hyperdrama \"The Last Song of Violeta Parra\" in the canon of \"first generation hypertext.\" Deemer also has written a hyperdrama expansion of Chekhov's \"The Seagull\". In 2009, Harvard’s The American Repertory Theater and Punchdrunk performed \"Sleep No More,\" \"a hyperdrama rendition of \"Macbeth\" with a creepy, Hitchcock feel.\"\n\nDr Hannah Rudman, who wrote \"The Benefactor: a Hyperdrama\" in 1998 with Dr Billy Smart, describes the form this way: \"A hyperdrama is a play that is written in hypertext, that is performed as a promenade and that is realised on multiple levels. Scenes happen simultaneously throughout a performance space. In this hyperdrama, there are five different locations where the action takes place. The scripts for the different locations are divided into levels which represent the time span of the piece (about 45 minutes real time). All the characters and locations in this hyperdrama are of equal importance. As a reader, you could follow the path of one character through the play by clicking on their hypertext links; read all the separate scripts in a linear fashion; or explore the hyperdrama more randomly by swapping between rooms via the hotlinks.\"\n\nRussell Anderson, author of \"Woyzeck: a Hyperdrama,\" calls his play \"a performance in the ‘hyperdrama’ format: that is, where multiple elements of performance occur in multiple locations simultaneously.\"\n\nTegan Zimmerman uses the presentation software Prezi to explore \"Hypertext and Hyperdrama\" and their relationship online.\n\nOther hyperdrama works of note are \"Tamara\" by John Krizanc, which had a long run in Los Angeles in the 1980s, and \"Tony and Tina's Wedding\", perhaps the most widely produced and popular hyperdrama.\n\nA number of universities have added the study of Hyperdrama to their hypertext and electronic media studies: the University of Virginia, Tunxis Community College, New York University, among them.\n\nDiscussion of hyperdrama is included in the book \"Theatre In Cyberspace\" (Peter Lang, 1999): \"theatre practitioners are increasing their potential audiences with online technology while attempting to discover how to present theatre in an interactive yet non-corporeal way. Also fascinating is how educators and practitioners can collaborate, creating online performance spaces that can be adapted for teaching, and creating online teaching techniques that can be adapted for performance. This volume of essays presents information from some of the pioneers in the field of cyberspace theatre who write of their work in both theoretical and practical terms, thus creating a kind of \"Theatre and Its Double\" for computers and theatre.\"\n\n\n\npart of an MA Thesis on Hyperdrama\n"}

It was originally believed to have belonged to the church in Antioch, a thriving Roman city on the Mediterranean It can now be argued that the items come from a larger collection of silver from the church of Saint Sergios in modern-day Kurin, Syria or that the pieces belonged to a small local church. The final items of the collection were likely interred at the site in the seventh century as the Byzantine Empire subsequently lost this area of Syria to the Persian army. The later conquering by the Muslim Arab army permanently removed the area from Byzantine control.\n\nIt is believed that the Persian and Muslim Arab take-overs were relatively peaceful as historic sites around the area show little to no damage that could be attributed to that time. Though religion began to shift following the change of power and Christian artifacts were increasingly stored away from public viewing, the area did continue to benefit from relative wealth and prosperity, creating many secular works. The real halt to production of silver treasures is thought to have followed a plague throughout the area from 542 to 544. This had a lasting impact on the economic status of the region.\n\nThere is evidence that this accumulation of local wealth in silver objects was common throughout the area leading up to the Persian control and the sixth century plague. Similar treasures have been found at Stuma, Riha, Hama, and Antioch to name a few.\n\nThe objects found in the Kaper Koraon treasure were not originally prestigious shrine gifts but were likely relatively cheap imitations made specifically for a village church. This can be clearly seen from recent investigations into the pieces which have shown high quantities of copper and other metals melted in with the silver to increase malleability and decrease production costs. It is estimated that these items were the collective donations from five local families over a period of at least three decades. Many of the stamps present on the pieces are believed to have been added after production and some note the specific donors of each piece.\n\nThe Kaper Koraon treasure consists of 56 total silver objects including: eight chalices, seven patens, five crosses, one cross revetment, two lamp stands, three lamps, three ewers, one flask, one bowl, one mirror, one box, eleven spoons, one ladle, two strainers, two fans, and four plaques. The other three objects are only partial pieces of broken fragments likely from other plaques. Many of the items are religious in nature including images of the cross and Jesus's disciples. Some are believed to be secular but were stored with the church collection either for safe-keeping on behalf of the owner or stores of wealth for the parish.\n\nMost of the silver pieces shown here still show evidence of hammering either visibly or through careful machine investigation. Due to the limited skill level of local workers and the overworking of malleable metal, many items featured here have stress fractures or chips that were original to the piece. Any repairs visible, such as the re-welding of a handle onto an ewar, are likely original and occurred before the internment of the treasure. Many of the chalices were hammered, welded together, and then lathed to smooth out the seams between the cup and the stem. Some chalices shows signs of wear at these seams and around the top rim due to the method of their construction.\n\nSince their discovery, the items of the Kaper Koraon treasure have dispersed into public and private collections throughout the world including The Walters Art Museum.\n"}

Born in Ramsgate, Bayley performed onstage in Victorian burlesques, revues, and pantomimes, often with her three sisters. After marrying the showman George Albert Smith, she entered the world of early experiments with motion picture film; she played main roles in many of the most important films Smith made between 1897 and 1903, including \"The Kiss in the Tunnel\" (1899) and \"Mary Jane's Mishap\" (1903).\n\nBehind the camera, Bayley likely played a significant hand in the creative development of Smith's fiction films, and may have directed some of those currently credited to him. She also directed and supervised numerous other films on her own, including a series for an early show-at-home projector design. Film historians have highlighted her prolific career as a film performer as well as the creative talent she brought to filmmaking.\n\nBayley was born on 4 February 1862 in the English seaside town of Ramsgate. She and her sisters Blanche, Florence, and Eva worked together as performers for J. D. Hunter's Theatre Company, which produced a \"burlesque\" extravaganza every year at the Brighton Aquarium. \"The Brighton Society\", in 1887, praised \"the Misses Bayley … who, by their charming vocal selections added so considerably to the success of the burlesque \"Brown and the Brahmins\"\".\n\nBayley's three sisters also performed without her for some Aquarium productions, such as in the pantomimes \"Cinderella\" and \"Dick Whittington\" in August 1890 and again in the latter in 1892, but the four sisters were reunited at the Aquarium for \"Babes in the Wood\" in 1894, about which the \"Brighton Herald\" commented that \"The Robin Hood of Miss Laura Bayley is a distinctly comely and cheery Robin Hood\".\n\nOn 13 June 1888, at the Congregational Church in Ramsgate, Bayley married George Albert Smith. Smith, known as \"Bertie\" among his professional colleagues, was a young stage entertainer, performing hypnosis acts and second sight routines in local venues, including the Brighton Aquarium. Bayley and Smith married in a double wedding: the other couple was Bayley's sister Florence and the Bayleys' theatrical colleague J. D. Hunter.\n\nBayley and Smith had two children, Harold Norman and Dorothy Eugenie, in 1889 and 1890, respectively. In 1892, Smith acquired a lease on St. Ann's Well and Wild Garden, a pleasure garden in Brighton; it reopened under his management the following spring. Together, Bayley and Smith mounted summer fancy dress parties, attended by as many as 2,000 costumed patrons, at the garden. Smith also gave magic lantern performances and dioramic lectures, and exhibited the newly invented Edison phonograph, as part of the garden's entertainments.\n\nSmith's interest in novel forms of entertainment led him toward early experiments with motion picture film, and in 1897 he began making short films on the St. Ann's Well grounds. By the time of Smith's foray into filmmaking, Bayley had had wide experience in comic acting for pantomime and revues, and Smith drew extensively on her knowledge of visual humour and audience tastes. She played lead roles in many of his most significant films, including \"Hanging out the Clothes\" (1897), \"Santa Claus\" (1898), \"Cinderella\" (1898), \"The Kiss in the Tunnel\" (1899), \"As Seen Through the Telescope\" (1900), \"Let Me Dream Again\" (1900), \"Dorothy's Dream\" (1900), and \"Mary Jane's Mishap\" (1903). In at least one instance, Smith and Bayley mixed their theatrical and film work together: when J. D. Hunter's company toured \"Dick Whittington\" in early 1897, Bayley and her sister Blanche performed live onstage, while Smith came along on the tour to exhibit his \"animated photographs\" as part of the entertainment.\n\nOther members of Bayley's family also became involved in Smith's filmmaking; all three of her sisters probably appeared in his films, as did her two children; notably, the film historian Frank Gray suggested that Harold and Dorothy Smith probably both appear in \"Santa Claus\" and \"The House that Jack Built\", and that Harold also plays the grandson in \"Grandma's Reading Glass\".\n\nDuring her acting career, Bayley also worked on her own as a filmmaker, making numerous short films that were designed and marketed for a home projector, the Biokam. Smith and Bayley probably worked in creative collaboration to devise the fiction films Smith directed; Bayley may also have directed some of the films currently credited to Smith, as his records indicate that she supervised the \"facials\" (comic short films emphasising facial expression). Bayley handled sales of the Biokam films and related materials, and may also have participated in the process of making cameras.\n\nLater in the decade, after the series of Biokam films, Bayley also appeared in some of Smith's 1906–1908 tests of the colour-film process Kinemacolor. Bayley died at home at 7 Melville Road, Hove, on 25 October 1938.\n\nBayley's work was usually overlooked in twentieth-century assessments of the Brighton School, with some film historians simply calling her \"Smith's wife\" or \"Mrs. Smith\". Several twenty-first-century film historians have drawn attention to this neglect and to her contributions, though she remains relatively little-known in the field.\nThe British Film Institute's Screenonline database ranks Bayley as \"the most prolific British actress\" in turn-of-the-century cinema. In program notes for the Pordenone Silent Film Festival, where three Bayley films were shown in 2002, the film historian David Robinson cited Bayley and her sisters as the first known comediennes in British film. The film writer Ellen Cheshire, in a 2016 study of women working behind the camera in early film, identified Bayley as film history's first woman cinematographer.\n\nIn a discussion of Bayley's collaboration with Smith, the film historian Frank Gray wrote: \"Laura Bayley brought to this creative work a keen understanding of popular texts, an unself-conscious and dynamic style of acting and a rich sense of humour. Audiences which still laugh at her winking at the camera when watching \"Mary Jane's Mishap\" are acknowledging her considerable achievement.\"\n"}
{"id": "4369933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4369933", "title": "Leo Castelli", "text": "Leo Castelli\n\nLeo Castelli (born Leo Krausz; September 4, 1907 – August 21, 1999) was an Italian-American art dealer. His gallery showcased contemporary art for five decades. Among the movements which Castelli showed were Surrealism, Abstract Expressionism, Neo-Dada, Pop Art, Op Art, Color field painting, Hard-edge painting, Lyrical Abstraction, Minimal Art, Conceptual Art, and Neo-expressionism.\n\nLeo Castelli was born Leo Krausz, in Trieste, Austria-Hungary, the second of three children of Italian and Austro-Hungarian Jewish origin. His father was Ernest Krauss, a Hungarian by birth, who had gone to Trieste as a young man and married wealthy heiress Bianca Castelli, from a family of coffee importers which had long been based there. After World War I, which the family spent in Vienna (where Leo Castelli learned perfect German), they returned to Trieste. The family changed its name to \"Krausz-Castelli\" and then \"Castelli\" in the mid-1930s, when Mussolini's government required names to be Italianized.\n\nAfter earning a law degree at the University of Milan in 1924, Castelli returned to Trieste, where his father had secured a job for him with an insurance company. In 1932, he went to work for an insurance company in Bucharest, where he married Ileana Schapira one year later. After their marriage, the couple honeymooned in Vienna and bought their first artwork, a Matisse watercolor.\n\nCastelli's father-in-law, Mihai Schapira, helped him to be transferred in 1935 to the Banca d'Italia in Paris. There, Ileana's taste and money helped him start his first gallery at Place Vendôme in Paris, which was named for its co-director, the decorator René Drouin, and situated between the Ritz Hotel and the couturier Elsa Schiaparelli. Specializing in surrealistic art, the gallery opened in July 1939, with a show of modern and antique furniture, including commissioned pieces by Drouin, Max Ernst, Meret Oppenheim, Leonor Fini (a former girlfriend of Castelli's from Trieste), Eugene Berman, and other artists in the force field of Surrealism.\n\nIleana's connections enabled the couple to flee to America at the start of World War II. Castelli's parents did not escape but died in Budapest, hounded by members of Hungary's fascist Arrow Cross Party. The couple would remain married for more than 25 years, and were friends and partners even after their divorce, when Ileana married Michael Sonnabend and that couple opened its own gallery. Castelli arrived in the United States in 1941, by way of Marrakesh, Tangier, Algeciras, Vigo and Havana. He took graduate history courses in economic history at Columbia University until volunteering for the Army, serving in the intelligence service in Europe. After the liberation of France, he was sent to Bucharest as an interpreter for the Allied commission that controlled the city. As a result of Castelli's military service, he was given American citizenship. Returning to New York, Castelli took a managerial position with his father-in-law's clothing factory.\n\nIn New York, the Castellis were two of only three non-artist members (the other was dealer Charles Egan) of the Club, an influential coterie founded in 1949 that included Willem de Kooning, Robert Rauschenberg, Franz Kline, and Ad Reinhardt. Castelli's first exercise as a private dealer came through Drouin, in 1947: some hundred canvases by Kandinsky, consigned by his widow, Nina. His first American curatorial effort was the Ninth Street Show of 1951, a seminal event in the emergence of Abstract Expressionism. He soon attached himself to the pioneering gallerist Sidney Janis, one of the early proponents of the school. In 1957, he opened the Leo Castelli Gallery in a townhouse at 4 E. 77th Street between Madison and Fifth Avenues in New York City. From the mid-1960s through the 1970s, the gallery was perhaps the most prominent commercial venue for art in the world. Initially the gallery showcased European Surrealism, Wassily Kandinsky, and other European artists. However the gallery also exhibited American Abstract Expressionism. Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Cy Twombly, Friedel Dzubas, and Norman Bluhm were some artists who were included in group shows.\n\nIn 1958, Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns joined the gallery, signaling a turning away from Abstract Expressionism, towards Pop Art, Minimalism and Conceptual Art. From the early 1960s through the late 70s, Frank Stella, Larry Poons, Lee Bontecou, James Rosenquist, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Robert Morris, Donald Judd, Dan Flavin, Cy Twombly, Ronald Davis, Ed Ruscha, Salvatore Scarpitta, Richard Serra, Bruce Nauman, Lawrence Weiner and Joseph Kosuth joined the stable of Castelli artists. He gave Johns, Stella and Lichtenstein their first one-man shows. Castelli opened a temporary annex, the Castelli Warehouse, on West 108th Street, with a show organized by Robert Morris, of environmental sculpture by nine artists, including Nauman, Serra, and Eva Hesse. In 1971 Leo Castelli opened a downtown SoHo branch of the Leo Castelli Gallery at 420 West Broadway, in a building bought by the Hague Art Delivery Company and a cooperative of dealers: Castelli took the second floor; his former wife's Sonnabend Gallery the took the third floor, and André Emmerich (later replaced by Charles Cowles) took the top floor; while John Weber, (former director of the Dwan Gallery) rented his gallery on the fourth floor. In the 1980s, Castelli opened a second larger downtown exhibition space at a 142 Greene Street also in SoHo. He later mounted joint shows with Mary Boone, of Julian Schnabel, in 1981, and David Salle, in 1982.\n\nCastelli also pioneered a stipend system that was unknown in New York when he opened his gallery. He put his artists on a payroll whether or not their work sold. For this and other reasons, desertions were initially rare among his artists. When Castelli discovered Serra in 1967, for example, he offered him a guarantee of three years of monthly payments even though he did not expect to sell any of the unknown sculptor's lead-plate work in that time. Castelli also was known for spotting new talent and insisting on European exposure for his American artists, leading to Rauschenberg in 1964 becoming the first American to win the Venice Biennale's international grand prize in painting. His most important clients included Peter Ludwig and Giuseppe Panza.\n\nCastelli's second wife, Antoinette Fraissex du Bost, opened Castelli Graphics, an art gallery devoted to the prints and photographs of Castelli Gallery and other artists. The couple also had a son together, Jean-Christophe Castelli, but Antoinette Castelli died in 1987. In 1995 Leo Castelli married the Italian art historian Barbara Bertozzi Castelli.\n\nIn 2015, Bertozzi Castelli opened a one-room satellite gallery at 1046 Madison Avenue, near 80th Street, with Robert Morris's installation \"Lead and Felt\" (1969).\n\nCastelli received the rosette of the French Legion of Honor, allegedly in exchange for donating works by Johns to the Centre Pompidou. The mayor of Trieste made him the honorary director of the Revoltella Museum. In 1998, the National Arts Club awarded Castelli its Centennial Medal of Honor. On this occasion, Dennis Hopper called Castelli \"the godfather of the contemporary art world.\"\n\nIn 1982 a traveling exhibit honoring the 25th anniversary of Castelli Gallery visited the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art. The Museum of Art, Fort Lauderdale, showed \"Three Decades of Exploration: Homage to Leo Castelli\", an exhibit of more than 30 works by artists discovered, shown and encouraged by Castelli in 1987. That same year, the Butler Institute of American Art presented \"Leo Castelli: a tribute exhibition\". In 1996, Gagosian Gallery mounted the exhibition \"Leo Castelli: An Exhibition in Honor of His Gallery and Artists\" in Beverly Hills.\n\nMany artists have enshrined Castelli in their works. Elaine de Kooning and Richard Artschwager painted his portrait, Warhol made a silkscreen of him in a jacket and tie. Frank Stella named a work after him, in 1992 he posed for the French artist Klaus Guingand who immortalized his shadow, and a sculpture by Robert Morris, \"Leo\", places a brain at the center of a target. In 1999, on the occasion of Castelli's death, \"Time\" published a eulogy by James Rosenquist.\n\nIn 1988, when there were no tax deductions for gifts to museums, Castelli gave one of the icons of postwar American art, Robert Rauschenberg's \"Bed\" (1955) to the Museum of Modern Art. In 1992, amid rumors that Castelli was negotiating to sell his archives to the Getty Center in Los Angeles, his collection was said to be worth some $2 million. In October 2007, Castelli's heirs – his widow, Barbara Bertozzi Castelli, and his two children, Jean-Christopher Castelli and Nina Castelli Sundell – announced the donation of the gallery's archives from 1957 through 1999 to the Smithsonian Institution's Archives of American Art. Castelli had been interviewed for the archive's oral-history project in 1969, 1973 and 1997.\n\nThe Leo Castelli Gallery continues to operate at 18 East 77th Street in New York under the direction of his wife showing many of the same artists from the gallery's past. The Leo Award, presented annually by the Independent Curators International (ICI), is named after the late Castelli.\n\n"}

Of these, ten that are situated in the Troodos Mountains have been inscribed jointly on the UNESCO World Heritage List as the Painted Churches in the Troodos Region.\n\nThe origins of Christianity on the island may be traced to the visit of St. Paul, St. Barnabas and St. Mark around AD 46. After the fall of the western Roman Empire, Cyprus came under the sway of Byzantium, although the timely discovery of Barnabas' relics helped the Church of Cyprus uphold its autocephaly. The crusader Kingdom of Cyprus outlived the Fall of Constantinople by a generation; the subsequent sale of the island to Venice led to a brief period of Italo-Byzantine painting. In 1571 Cyprus fell to the Ottomans and the practice of ecclesiastic wall painting largely came to an end.\n\nSubject to the layout of each church, the iconographic schema typically accords with the classic Byzantine , evident also in Byzantine mosaic decoration, the three zones comprising: (1) the dome and conch of the apse; (2) the pendentives, squinches and upper vaults; and (3) the lower, secondary vaults and walls. The first is reserved for depictions of the holiest persons, the Christ Pantokrator and the Virgin; the second for scenes from the Life of Christ and the festival cycle; and the third for the choir of intercessory saints.\n\nSince the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, a number of churches in the north have been looted and their wall paintings detached to supply the international antiquities trade. Among them is the Church of St. Evphemianos in Lysi: the thirteenth-century Pantrokrator and surrounding angels were detached, leaving their feet behind; the paintings were then acquired for the Menil Collection and displayed at the Byzantine Fresco Chapel in Houston, Texas before their repatriation to the south in 2012. Meanwhile, many churches in the south been the subject of conservation interventions, conducted by the Department of Antiquities, Dumbarton Oaks and the Courtauld Institute of Art, aimed at reconciling the competing demands of stability, legibility and authenticity within the framework of ongoing devotional practice.\n\n\n"}

Film scholar Paul Julian Smith wrote in 2015 that she is “arguably the most critically acclaimed auteur in Spanish-language art cinema outside Latin America” and that her “transnational auteurism and demanding features have earned her a hard-won reputation in the world art cinema festival circuit.”. Similarly, film scholar Haden Guest has called her “one of the most prodigiously talented filmmakers in contemporary world cinema,” and film scholar has called her body of work a “rare perfection.” In April 2018, \"Vogue\" called her \"one of the greatest directors in the world right now\".\n\nHer 2001 debut feature film \"La Ciénaga\" (\"The Swamp\"), about an indulgent bourgeois extended family spending the summertime in a decrepit vacation home in provincial Salta, Argentina, was internationally highly acclaimed upon release and introduced a new and vital voice to Argentine cinema. David Oubiña called it \"one of the highest achievements\" of the New Argentine Cinema, a wave of contemporary filmmaking that began in the mid-1990s in reaction to decades of political and economic crises in the country. The film, Oubiña wrote, is \"a rare expression of an extremely troubled moment in the nation’s recent history. It is a masterpiece of singular maturity\".\n\nMartel's succeeding three feature films received further international acclaim: the adolescent drama \"The Holy Girl\" (2004), the psychological thriller \"The Headless Woman\" (2008), and the period drama adaptation \"Zama\" (2017).\n\nThe second of seven children, Martel was born and raised in Salta, Argentina. Her father Ferdi owned and operated a paint shop, while her mother Bochi dedicated herself to the family. Her parents met in university (where Ferdi studied science and Bochi studied philosophy) and got married at 24 years old. Eventually they left their careers and settled in Salta. \n\nIn primary school, Martel’s minister uncle helped her develop interests in mythology, Greek, and Latin. In fifth grade, she set her sights on gaining admission to the elite, \"ultra-Catholic\" secondary school Bachillerato Humanista Moderno, because it was the only school in Salta that offered classes in dead languages. Her parents opposed the school because of its elitist tradition which they felt reinforced class differences, but, because of the and Martel’s intellectual curiosity, they did not stop her from her pursuit. Eventually, Martel passed the demanding entrance exam and enrolled in the school in the sixth grade. Since she came from a “solidly middle class” family, as she stated in a revealing 2008 interview with \"BOMB Magazine\", Martel felt like an outsider at the school. Her peers, she said, attended the school because their families expected them to, while she only attended it so she could study Greek and Latin. In a 2018 interview with \"Gatopardo\" magazine, her mother said that at the school Martel was a “radical and challenging” honor roll student who excelled in science.\n\nIn her home, Martel says \"there was a very deep devotion to storytelling.\" Her father, mother, and maternal grandmother Nicolasa were \"very good storytellers\" and would tell her and her six siblings \"lots of stories\" to keep them quiet in bed while the adults took their afternoon siesta. She was especially fascinated by the way her grandmother used different sounds, tones, and carefully selected pauses to establish \"atmosphere\" in her scary, fantastical stories. \"As a child,\" Martel says, \"and even today, I have always been captivated by the form not only of stories and storytelling, but also of conversation and the way people pause and leave space for someone to intervene. All the ways that, especially when you’re a child, you’re charmed and steered just by words alone.\" She says that her fascination with this \"world of conversation\" in oral storytelling is what fueled her passion for cinematic storytelling and the emphasis on sound in her films.\n\nMartel first used a video camera when she was \"15 or 16\" years old, she says, after her father bought one to store memories of their large family. \"A very big investment for us,\" she says of the camera, nobody in the family used it but her. \"I began recording conversations and everyday things: family stuff,\" she says. \"My family got used to it because I was always filming…. There are two or three years in our family life where I don’t appear at all in videos or photos, because I was always behind the camera. It was the discovery of something that fascinated me, but it didn’t seem to me then that my future could be related to that.\"\n\nWhen she was 17 years old, she accompanied her father to Buenos Aires and attended a cinema projection of \"Camila\" (1984), a film written and directed by María Luisa Bemberg and produced by Lita Stantic about a real and tragic love story between a priest and a young lady of Buenos Aires high society. Impressed with the film’s women creators and mainstream success, Martel says that as a result of the viewing she “thought the cinema was a woman's job,” a “confusion,” as she describes it, that \"stayed with [her]” for years.\n\nUpon graduating from secondary school, Martel intended to study physics at the Balseiro Institute, but she \"started to have doubts\" and instead enrolled in an art history course at the National University of Salta, as well as in chemical engineering and zoology courses in Tucumán, a nearby province. \"Suffer[ing] uncertainty” and trying to decide “what to study or do with [her] life,” she farmed pigs that year, too—breeding, raising, and selling them—and even considered making it her future livelihood. However, poor sales of just two pigs per month proved it would not be a feasible career option for her.\n\nAt the end of that school year, Martel traveled to Buenos Aires to study advertising at the Catholic University. The program combined creativity and technique, so she and her family thought it could work for her. Although Martel says she lost her Catholic faith at 15 years old, at the university she volunteered with Catholic Action and spoke against abortion. Feeling uncomfortable, she decided to distance herself from the faith and leave the school to pursue the new communication sciences degree program at the University of Buenos Aires. She describes the program as “a typical post-transition-to-democracy program made to train journalists and media analysts. Of course, it was an area of Argentine culture that had been hit especially hard by the years of dictatorship. There were very interesting professors who were returning from exile at the time, people with more left-leaning ways of thinking. It was a good moment for the program because no one quite knew exactly what this career entailed.” She completed all of the degree requirements, she says, but “didn’t do any of the paperwork toward receiving the [actual] degree.\" However, she believes that her time at the school \"helped [her] out a lot.\"\n\nNot wanting to neglect her interests in the technical and the creative, while at the University of Buenos Aires she enrolled in a nighttime animation course at the located about 5.5 miles away, which Martel describes was a significant commute at the time. “Something of the scientific spirit in me remained,” she says regarding her decision to enroll in the school, “and I liked how animation was very technical, precise, and controlled.” At the school, she started to meet people who were studying film and began to produce short films.\n\nWhile at IDAC, she decided to take the admission exam for Argentina’s only state-sponsored film school at the time—the . Since over 1,000 people signed up for the exam and only 30 vacancies existed at the school, applicants were required to take a “huge qualifying course,” which Martel says she spent months preparing for. After she “finally got in,” the school closed due to lack of funds. “When school was supposed to start,” she says, “the economic crisis was already so severe that there weren’t any professors or materials. We didn’t have classes. The only real possibility was to study autodidactically, to watch films and analyze them. I watched \"Pink Floyd: The Wall\" 23 times, analyzing the montage. We would watch a film many times to learn how it was edited. I was learning in many different ways—participating in short films that friends were making, helping with production or photography, anything just to keep learning.” Martel has maintained in interviews that she was self-taught.\n\nWhile attending , Martel directed the animated short films \"El 56\" (\"The 56\") in 1988 and \"Piso 24\" (\"24th Floor\") in 1989.\n\nAs a film student at , Martel directed \"No te la llevarás, maldito\" (\"You Won’t Get Her, Bastard,\" 1989), a short film about a jealous boy who fantasizes about killing his mother’s boyfriend. Film scholar Deborah Martin wrote that in the film, “there is an exploration of the subversive power of children that would become a crucial feature of [Martel’s] later work, as a little boy's murderous Oedipal feelings towards his mother's lover are fully unleashed in a fantasy he lives out through his drawings.”\n\nAnother short film Martel directed as a student is \"La otra\" (\"The Other,\" 1990), a documentary about a man who talks about the joys and sorrows of his life as a transvestite as he dresses up as a woman to sing tangos at a nightclub.\n\nNext, Martel directed \"Besos rojos\" (\"Red Kisses,\" 1991), a short film based on a real-life police case between three lovers caught in a love triangle.\n\nMartel says that “just when [she] was starting to think that [a career in] film was impossible, that it was time for [her] to get a (real) job,” she entered a public script competition organized by the Argentine National Film Board (INCAA), the grand prize for which was the budget to produce a short film. Martel won the contest and, as a result, was able to produce her breakout film \"\" (\"Dead King,\" 1995), a violent western about a woman who escapes her abusive, alcoholic husband with her three children in a small town called Rey Muerto in provincial Salta, Argentina. It went on to win Best Short Film at the 1995 Havana Film Festival.\n\n\"Rey muerto\" was exhibited in Argentina as part of a larger omnibus film called \"\" (\"Short Stories,\" 1995). Martel explains that this compilation film was “unprecedented in the country” and came about after all the directors of the other winning short films in the script contest banded together and visited the INCAA headquarters in Buenos Aires repeatedly to ask the contest organizers to premiere all the short films as a string of films in a theater. Martel says that she and her fellow filmmakers “sat for hours until [the contest organizers] would meet with us. We argued that it was a waste of state funding if they didn’t exhibit the finished films.” As a result, the films were exhibited on the dedicated screens of the national public circuit run by INCAA. Martel says that the premiere of \"Historias breves\" was \"very successful\" and drew 10,000 viewers. \"It also inspired people,\" she says, \"to study filmmaking and to start making shorts. It was a really important phenomenon in spiritual terms. Curiously, many of the directors who began their careers at the time—’95 or ’96—are still making films today. That event inaugurated the activity of a lot of directors, and also a lot of young people’s interest in film.\" Film scholar Haden Guest says it helped inaugurate the New Argentine Cinema and “is really where the [movement] began.” \n\nMartel says that “thanks to \"Rey muerto\", [she] started to get jobs in television.” From 1995 to 1999 she directed the unconventional children's program \"\", in which child actors performed in different sketch comedies. In a 2013 interview with \"ABC Color\", Martel says the show “became a cult for children... It was not commercially known, but there are a lot of young people who saw it. Many of its actors are now stars of Argentine cinema.” She also made two documentaries for television: \"Encarnación Ezcurra\" (1998), about the eponymous wife of Argentine politician and army officer Juan Manuel de Rosas, and \"Las dependencias (The Outbuildings)\" (1999), a reconstruction of the life of the celebrated Argentine short fiction writer Silvina Ocampo, which draws on the testimonies of Ocampo's servants and friends.\n\nIn 1999, Martel's screenplay for her debut feature film \"La Ciénaga\" (\"The Swamp,\" 2011) won the Sundance Institute/NHK Award, which honors and supports emerging independent filmmakers \"who contribute to the world's visual culture and promote cultural exchanges\". The jury recommended that she re-write the script to follow a more traditional structure around one or two protagonists, but Martel chose instead to retain the script's diffuse nature. To cast the film's child actors, Martel held 2,400 auditions, 1,600 of which she recorded on video in a garage near her home in Salta. \n\nIn 2001, Martel was selected for the 3rd edition of the Cannes Film Festival Cinéfondation artist-in-residence program, designed to inspire and support young international filmmakers working on their first or second feature film. As part of the program, Martel lived in Paris for four and a half months, attended forums and worked with film industry professionals in developing her second feature film, \"The Holy Girl\", which premiered in 2004.\n\nTogether with \"The Headless Woman\" (2008), Martel's first three feature films make up what \"Gatopardo\" magazine calls \"a trilogy dedicated to women and Salta,\" writing, \"The three scripts were written by her, the three films were filmed in Salta, and, in all, always, something unexpected alters family cosmology. The characters see the life that they have armed, but, although a magma of bad omens descends on them, they do not react. In \"La Ciénaga\", it is a domestic accident that the mother of a large family suffers. In \"The Holy Girl (La niña santa)\", it is a doctor who arrives in a town and stays in a hotel where the owner lives with her teenage daughter, a student of a religious school. In \"The Headless Woman (La mujer sin cabeza)\", it is an accident on a deserted route and a family cover-up to hide guilt and tragedy.”\n\n“Martel’s filmic trilogy about life in the province of Salta, Argentina,\" writes film scholar Paul A. Schroeder Rodríguez, \"explores the country’s incomplete transition to democracy from the perspective of strong, intelligent, and socially privileged female protagonists who do not conform to dominant patriarchal values: first during childhood in \"La Ciénaga\" (\"The Swamp\", 2001), then during sexual awakening in \"La niña santa\" (\"The Holy Girl\", 2004); and finally in adulthood, in \"La mujer sin cabeza\" (\"The Headless Woman\", 2008)”... Martel’s work is finely tuned to the particular rhythms and values of provincial middle-class Argentina, a world whose economic stagnation and moral bankruptcy she dissects through narratives that play on viewers’ sympathies by constantly shifting between favorable and unfavorable perspectives on her characters.”\n\n\"Filmmaker\" magazine wrote, “[Martel’s] debut feature \"La Ciénaga\" premiered at Sundance, won the Alfred Bauer Award at Berlin, and received rave reviews wherever it played. Martel’s 2004 follow-up, \"The Holy Girl\", about the sexual and religious passions of two Argentinian teenage girls, premiered at Cannes and consolidated Martel’s reputation as one of the finest emerging talents in world cinema.”\n\nFilm scholar Paul Julian Smith wrote that although “Martel has had to rely rather on a cocktail of small, mainly European, production companies” to fund her films, “industrial constraints and transnational flow have not compromised [her] artistic individuality... [Her] severe art movie aesthetics identify her with other transnational auteurs favoured on the festival circuit.” \n\n\"La Ciénaga\" (2001) received numerous international awards, and \"The Holy Girl\" and \"The Headless Woman\" were nominated for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festivals of 2004 and 2008, respectively.\n\nIn a survey of 35 prominent film critics, scholars and industry professionals based in New York City, all three feature films figured among the top ten Latin American films of the decade, with \"La Ciénaga\" taking top place, beating the better-known (and more accessible) works of the Mexican male triad of Alejandro González Iñárritu, Alfonso Cuarón, and Guillermo del Toro. \n\nIn August 2016, \"The Headless Woman\" ranked #89 on BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century, polled from 177 film critics around the world.\n\nMartel's work has also attracted a good deal of academic attention. Many scholars have written extensively regarding the films’ critiques of gender and sexuality, as well as its bold depictions of class, race, nationality, and colonialism. \n\nFilm scholar Deborah Shaw argues that the trilogy “presents an anatomy of Argentine, bourgeois female identity” and “explores the micropolitics of gender, sexuality and location, rather than national narratives of oppression and collective liberation.”\n\nPaul A. Schroeder Rodríguez described the films as “Oedipal with a vengeance” and argues that “each of the films is set up as a dialectic between a desiring female subject and the hegemonic patriarchal reality.”\n\nFilm scholar Deborah Martin wrote a full-length book on Martel's oeuvre, published in May 2016, in which she argues that Martel’s films “demonstrate possibilities of rupture and escape through her cinematic recreations of rebellious young girls’ forbidden desires... Despite the fact that these films depict in detail structures of social and political oppression, desire acts as an uncontrollable and multiple force which can overcome these structures.”\n\nIn May 2008, Martel was reported as slated to direct the film adaptation of \"The Eternaut\", the very popular Argentine science fiction comic strip created by Héctor Germán Oesterheld and Francisco Solano López in 1957 about a toxic snowfall and alien invasion of Buenos Aires. In October 2008, Martel said of the project to \"BOMB Magazine\", “I sent my idea of how to adapt it to the producer, and he was interested. I also know that members of the Oesterheld family liked it.” According to film scholar Deborah Martin, Martel was adapting it as a \"meditation on power and social class in Buenos Aires.\" In 2009, however, the project was dropped, after significant work had been undertaken on it, due to conceptual differences with the producer.\n\nMartel’s 2010 short film \"Nueva Agirópolis\" (\"New Argirópolis\") metaphorically represents indigenous people’s resistance to capture and interrogation by the Argentine state as well as the inevitable cultural hybridization that ensues between the two nations despite that resistance. It takes its name from the 1850 book \"Argirópolis\", written by former Argentine President and political activist Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, in which Argirópolis is the name of the capital city of a utopian democratic confederacy between Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay. The short film was commissioned by the Argentine Ministry of Culture as part of the Bicentennial celebrations and shown in theaters as part of the larger anthology film \"\" (\"25 Looks, 200 Minutes,\" 2010), an introspective look at the history of Argentina from the point of view of 25 film directors.\n\nIn July 2011, Martel's short film \"Muta\" (\"Mutate\") premiered at an invitation-only event in Beverly Hills attended by stars like Emma Roberts, Hailee Steinfeld, Ashley Tisdale, Cat Deeley, Diane Kruger, Jeremy Renner, and Marilyn Manson. Commissioned by Miu Miu, the Italian high fashion company owned by Prada, the film is the second installment of the company's \"Women's Tales\" film series, which consists of short films produced in conjunction with high-profile international female directors. Directed and co-written by Martel, the film depicts a luxury modernist ghost ship haunted by faceless, insect-like female creatures attempting to rid themselves of the only man trying to get onboard.\n\nIn her short film \"Leguas\" (\"Leagues,\" 2015), Martel explores the subject of academic exclusion in Argentina’s indigenous communities. Named after an archaic unit of measurement, the film depicts how education, though a social tool, can also create division and discrimination. It was distributed as part of the anthology documentary film \"El aula vacía\" (\"The Empty Classroom,\" 2015), in which eleven award-winning directors examine the underlying reasons why nearly one out of every two Latin American students never graduates high school.\n\nMartel’s fourth feature film \"Zama\" premiered at the Venice International Film Festival in August 2017. An adaptation of Antonio di Benedetto’s 1956 novel of the same name, it narrates the tragic story of Don Diego de Zama, a Spanish colonial functionary stationed in Asunción, Paraguay who waits, in vain, for his superiors to authorize his return home to his wife and family. It was an international co-production between eight countries: Argentina, Brazil, Spain, Mexico, France, the U.S., the Netherlands, and Portugal, with stars like Pedro Almodóvar, Gael García Bernal, and Danny Glover among its long list of producers. It went on to screen at the Toronto International Film Festival and New York Film Festival and received widespread acclaim from critics. \n\nMexican news magazine \"Gatopardo\" wrote of the film, “Like the other characters of Lucrecia Martel, only now in the late eighteenth century, Diego de Zama is unable to take charge of his own life; his fate is left in the hands of others. The identity that he has imposed on himself and that others have imposed on him is his prison.” wrote, “[\"Zama\"] is not an easy bone to crack. Martel delivers her most abstract, most ungraspable, most mysterious creation yet.” British newspaper \"The Guardian\" wrote of the film, “I hope Martel won’t have to wait a further nine years before she makes her next film. She’s too good a director to be sat on the sidelines for long and \"Zama\" may just be her left-field masterpiece; a picture that’s antic, sensual and strange, with a top-note of menace and a malarial air.” The film was chosen to represent Argentina in the Oscar and Goya Awards, the latter of which it received the nomination for Best Spanish Language Foreign Film.\n\nIn May 2018, Martel was filmmaker-in-residence at the University of Cambridge, where she offered a sequence of seminars on her filmmaking practice to students, staff, and the university community.\n\nMartel has cited María Luisa Bemberg, Ingmar Bergman, and Pedro Almodóvar as influences.\n\nIn 2006, she was a member of the Cannes Film Festival Feature Films Jury, alongside Wong Kar-wai, Helena Bonham Carter, and Samuel L. Jackson.\n\nShe has been in a relationship with the lead vocalist of Julieta Laso since 2016. Martel came out to her family just days before the 2001 premiere of \"La Ciénaga\" because she was worried about the implicit homosexuality depicted in the film. Her mother reacted lovingly to the news and said she knew since Martel was 7 years old. \n\nIn February 2016, while editing \"Zama\", Martel was diagnosed with uterine cancer. She stated that her illness caused a delay in the film's post-production but ultimately catalyzed its completion. In November 2017, IndieWire reported that she has been in remission since late 2016. \n\nAs of June 2018, she lives in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of Villa Crespo.\n\n\n\n\n"}

She is classically trained and since 2008 has released experimental pop music with her band Micachu and the Shapes, including their critically praised debut album \"Jewellery\" in 2009.\n\nIn 2014, Levi branched out into film composing, creating the score for the Jonathan Glazer film \"Under the Skin\". Her work was widely praised and Levi received a European Film Award for Best Composer and a BAFTA Award for Best Film Music nomination. Her score for Pablo Larraín's \"Jackie\" received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score.\n\nLevi was born and raised in Surrey, England, United Kingdom. the daughter of two musicians. She is half Romanian. Levi started writing and playing music at the age of four. \n\nLevi moved to London in her teens and performed as a DJ and released a mixtape titled \"Filthy Friends\", which was posted on her official Myspace page. For \"Filthy Friends\" she enlisted the help of friends and musicians of various backgrounds including MCs Baker Trouble, Brother May, Man Like Me & Ghostpoet, singer-songwriter Jack Peñate, jazz band Troyka, London pop-band Golden Silvers as well as producers Kwes and Toddla T. Following its release, \"Filthy Friends\" became sought after on the London club scene.\n\nWhile a student at Guildhall, Levi was commissioned to write an orchestral piece for the London Philharmonic Orchestra which was performed at the Royal Festival Hall in April 2008.\n\nLevi was an Artist-in-Residence at the Southbank Centre in London in 2010.\n\nLevi co-wrote and produced Tirzah's \"I'm Not Dancing\" EP, which was released by Greco-Roman Records in August 2013, to critical acclaim.\n\nLevi contributed to the soundtrack for Phil Collins' \"Ceremony\" at Manchester International Festival 2017.\n\nLevi formed a band called Micachu and the Shapes, which included Raisa Khan on keyboards and Marc Pell on drums. They signed to Accidental Records. With the Shapes, Levi's focus has been on experimental pop music. Most of this music prominently features an acoustic half-guitar with various non-standard tunings, extensive distortion, and use of noise and found-object elements, as well as occasionally unusual time signatures. Despite these experimental leanings, the artist categorizes her output with the Shapes as pop music.\n\nTheir debut album, \"Jewellery\", produced with influential electronic musician Matthew Herbert, was recorded around Mica's composition studies at Guildhall School. Advance copies of the record reached the press in early 2009, and generated positive feedback. In the wake of this growing buzz, Micachu and the Shapes were signed to Rough Trade, who released \"Jewellery\" on 9 March 2009. Drowned In Sound consequently hailed the record as \"thrillingly improbable pop made by a grade-A maverick.\"\n\nIn 2009, the band received a grant from the PRS for Music Foundation.\n\nMicachu and the Shapes toured widely throughout the UK in 2008, including performances at Bestival and V Festival. The band played in the US at the CMJ Music Marathon in New York City and SXSW in Austin, Texas. They also performed on the Main Stage of the Siren Music Festival at Coney Island in Brooklyn in July 2009. Touring continued throughout Europe and North America in the summer and fall of 2009. In Spring of 2010, Micachu and the Shapes supported Spoon on tour throughout North America.\n\nThe band performed with the London Sinfonietta at Kings Place, London in May 2010 and in March 2011 released the live recording as the album \"Chopped and Screwed\". Unlike their previous effort, the recording largely avoids pop sensibilities in favor of a slower, hip-hop indebted style and repetitive, discordant string arrangements. The band were chosen by Animal Collective to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival that they curated in May 2011 in Minehead, England.\n\nThe follow-up to their debut, \"Never\", was released on 23 July 2012.\n\nThe band released the album \"Good Sad Happy Bad\" on 11 September 2015. In March 2016, the band announced on social media that they were changing their name to Good Sad Happy Bad.\n\nLevi's first major film score was for Jonathan Glazer's 2014 film \"Under the Skin.\" The film is based on the novel of the same name by Michel Faber and stars Scarlett Johansson. Produced at age 26 and created in collaboration with Glazer, Levi's film score themes are so tightly woven into the film that they give a symbiotic quality, in which the aural feels inseparable from the visual. The score was widely acclaimed for pushing the boundaries of music and sound design and Levi was nominated for multiple awards. She won Best Composer at the 2014 European Film Awards, and tied with Jonny Greenwood for Best Music/Score at the 2014 Los Angeles Film Critics Awards. She was also nominated for the 2015 BAFTA Award for Best Film Music.\n\nIn 2016, Levi completed her second major film score, for Pablo Larraín's Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis biopic \"Jackie\". Larraín had been a juror at the 2013 Venice Film Festival, and thought that \"Under the Skin\" deserved a film score prize. Composer Ryuichi Sakamoto, also on the jury, was enthralled by Levi’s bold score for the film, and he and Larraín spoke passionately of her accomplishment, which led to the collaboration on \"Jackie\". Levi was nominated for Best Original Score at the 89th Academy Awards, making her the fifth woman nominated in the category, but lost to Justin Hurwitz for \"La La Land\".\n\n\n\n\nEuropean Film Awards, Best Composer for soundtrack to \"Under the Skin\" (2014)\n\nBAFTA nomination for soundtrack to \"Under the Skin\" (2014)\n\nLos Angeles Film Critics Award, Best Music Score for soundtrack to \"Under the Skin\".

Paul McCartney has spoken out in support of the MVT, saying that \"If we don’t support live music at this level then the future of music in general is in danger\".\n\nOne of the key reasons for the foundation of the MVT was the closure of many music venues, such as Brighton's Blind Tiger Club, due to noise complaints; this is especially important as noise complaints are becoming more frequent, as new laws have been introduced that make it easier to convert offices into housing. Another key concern that the MVT claims is facing venues is Arts Council England's lack of funding for venues; Beverley Whitrick, Strategic Director of the MVT, said in 2017 she could not estimate how many clubs would close in the next five years.\n\nThe MVA founded an international affiliate organisation in Austin, Texas in 2016, targeting state taxes that are seen as punitive towards local venues as well as the MVA New Zealand where they are fighting to have Agent of Change recognised and adopted. To clarify its political aims ahead of the 2017 general election, the MVT launched a \"Manifesto for Music 2017\" in May of that year.

{"id": "4368966", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4368966", "title": "Nature writing", "text": "Nature writing\n\nNature writing is nonfiction or fiction prose or poetry about the natural environment. Nature writing encompasses a wide variety of works, ranging from those that place primary emphasis on natural history facts (such as field guides) to those in which philosophical interpretation predominate. It includes natural history essays, poetry, essays of solitude or escape, as well as travel and adventure writing.\n\nNature writing often draws heavily on scientific information and facts about the natural world; at the same time, it is frequently written in the first person and incorporates personal observations of and philosophical reflections upon nature.\n\nModern nature writing traces its roots to the works of natural history that were popular in the second half of the 18th century and throughout the 19th. An important early figures was the \"parson-naturalist\" Gilbert White (1720 – 1793), a pioneering English naturalist and ornithologist. He is best known for his \"Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne\" (1789).\n\nWilliam Bartram (1739 – 1823) is a significant early American pioneer naturalist who first work was published in 1791.\n\nGilbert White is regarded by many as England's first ecologist, and one of those who shaped the modern attitude of respect for nature. He said of the earthworm: \"Earthworms, though in appearance a small and despicable link in the chain of nature, yet, if lost, would make a lamentable chasm. [...] worms seem to be the great promoters of vegetation, which would proceed but lamely without them\" White and William Markwick collected records of the dates of emergence of more than 400 plant and animal species in Hampshire and Sussex between 1768 and 1793, which was summarised in \"The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne\", as the earliest and latest dates for each event over the 25-year period, are among the earliest examples of modern phenology.\n\nThe tradition of clerical naturalists predates White and can be traced back to some monastic writings of the Middle Ages, although some argue that their writings about animals and plants cannot be correctly classified as natural history. Notable early parson-naturalists were William Turner (1508–1568), John Ray (1627–1705), William Derham (1657–1735).\n\nWilliam Bertram, in 1773, embarked on a four year journey through eight southern American colonies. Bartram made many drawings and took notes on the native flora and fauna, and the native American Indians. In 1774, he explored the St. Johns River. William Bartram wrote of his experiences exploring the Southeast in his book known today as \"Bartram's Travels\", published in 1791. Ephraim George Squier and Edwin Hamilton Davis, in their book, \"Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley\", name Bartram as \"the first naturalist who penetrated the dense tropical forests of Florida.\"\n\nAfter Gilbert White and William Bertram, other significant writers include American ornithologist John James Audubon (1785 – 1851), Charles Darwin( (1809 – 1882), Richard Jefferies (1848 – 1887), Susan Fenimore Cooper (1813 – 1894), mother of American nature writting, and Henry David Thoreau (1817 – 1862), who is often considered the father of modern American nature writing, Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803 – 1882) John Burroughs, John Muir, Aldo Leopold, Rachel Carson, M. Krishnan, and Edward Abbey (although he rejected the term for himself).\n\nAnother important early work is \"A History of British Birds\" by Thomas Bewick, published in two volumes. Volume 1, \"Land Birds\", appeared in 1797. Volume 2, \"Water Birds\", appeared in 1804. The book was effectively the first \"field guide\" for non-specialists. Bewick provides an accurate illustration of each species, from life if possible, or from skins. The common and scientific name(s) are listed, citing the naming authorities. The bird is described, with its distribution and behaviour, often with extensive quotations from printed sources or correspondents. Critics note Bewick's skill as a naturalist as well as an engraver.\n\nSome important contemporary figures in Britain include Richard Mabey, Roger Deakin, Mark Cocker, and Oliver Rackham. Rackham's books included \"Ancient Woodland\" (1980) and \"The History of the Countryside\" (1986). Richard Maybey has been involved with radio and television programmes on nature, and his book \"Nature Cure\", describes his experiences and recovery from depression in the context of man’s relationship with landscape and nature. He has also edited and introduced editions of Richard Jefferies, Gilbert White, Flora Thompson and Peter Matthiessen. Mark Crocker has written extensively for British newspapers and magazines and his books include Birds Britannica (with Richard Mabey) (2005). and \"Crow Country\" (2007). He frequently writes about modern responses to the wild, whether found in landscape, human societies or in other species. Roger Deakin was an English writer, documentary-maker and environmentalist. In 1999, Deakin's acclaimed book \"Waterlog\" was published. Inspired in part by the short story \"The Swimmer\" by John Cheever, it describes his experiences of 'wild swimming' in Britain's rivers and lakes and advocates open access to the countryside and waterways. Deakin's book \"Wildwood\" appeared posthumously in 2007. It describes a series of journeys across the globe that Deakin made to meet people whose lives are intimately connected to trees and wood.\n\nIn 2017 the German book publishing company Matthes & Seitz Berlin started to grant the German Award for Nature Writing, an annual literary award for writers in German language that excellently fulfil the criteria of the literary genre. It comes with a price money of 10.000 Euro and additionallly an artist in residency grant of six weeks at the International Academy for Nature Conservation of Germany on the German island Vilm. The British Council in 2018 is offering an education bursary and workshops to six young German authors dedicated to Nature writing.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41097224", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41097224", "title": "Non-dance", "text": "Non-dance\n\nNon-dance is a choreographic movement within contemporary dance. It began in the 1990, principally in France. Its practitioners see it as a transdisciplinary movement, dispensing with the movement vocabulary of traditional dance to integrate or substitute that of other performing arts (theater, video, lectures, music, etc.), and even plastic arts.\n\nMost of the choreographers who developed non-dance came from the milieu of \"nouvelle danse française\" (also known as \"jeune danse française\": \"new\" or \"young\" French dance) in which they participated as performers in the 1980s. They became choreographers in the 1990s, their work focusing increasingly on creating pieces where dance and dance movement disappear in favor of many other activities or theatrical techniques, including legitimate theater, lectures, plastic arts, music, and often video, film, or projections. The resulting performances are akin to performance art; in some cases, dancers as such are not even necessary to the execution of the work: the choreographer-author speaking through other media and sometimes in places not originally intended for dance performances, such as museums.\n\nThe precursor to this movement is Orazio Massaro (a dancer in the company of Dominique Bagouet from 1987 to 1990), who created the piece \"Volare\" for the Montpellier Dance Festival in 1990. In that piece, for the first time in the history of French contemporary dance, six dancers were deprived of choreography and become actors, in a critical look at dance through their autobiographical stories. \n\nMajor choreographers associated with non-dance include Boris Charmatz, Jérôme Bel, Hervé Robbe, Xavier Le Roy, Alain Buffard, Benoît Lachambre, Josef Nadj, Maguy Marin (in her recent pieces), Carlotta Sagna, and Wayn Traub.\n\n"}

{"id": "6235551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6235551", "title": "Opus vermiculatum", "text": "Opus vermiculatum\n\nOpus vermiculatum is a method of laying mosaic tesserae to emphasise an outline around a subject. This can be of one or more rows and may also provide background contrast, eg as a shadow, sometimes with Opus tessellatum. The outline created is often light and offset by a dark background for greater contrast. The name \"opus vermiculatum\" literally means \"worm-like work\", and has been described as one of the most demanding and elaborate forms of mosaic work. Usually \"opus vermiculatum\" is meant to put emphasis on the main design and foreground details of a work, using a smooth and flowing halo-effect. Sometimes it was used only around the head of a figure. The tesserae used were often square but can be variously shaped.\n\n\"Opus vermiculatum\" originated in Greece, later than other mosaic methods. The earliest known example is the Sophilos Mosaic of Thmuis, which has been dated to around 200 BC. The method spread throughout the Hellenistic world; for instance, the large corpus of surviving examples found on the island of Delos. In Egypt it was used for tomb decoration from the late-3rd to 1st Centuries BC, and in Syria, it survived into later times. The Nile Mosaic has a very refined use of color and shows an advanced development. This may indicate that the technique was based on paintings. In the 1st Century BC, it reached Italy along with other mosaic methods. Many fine examples of this style have been found at Pompeii. One remarkable work in particular portrays a crucial scene in the Battle of Issus, and was possibly copied from a 4th-century BC Greek painting or fresco. The use of \"opus vermiculatum\" declined after the 1st century AD, but continued to be employed for finer Roman mosaics until the 4th century. By then, mosaics were becoming increasingly impressionistic, taking advantage of the crystalline reflection of the tesserae, which was better suited to \"opus tessellatum\". It was eventually entirely abandoned for this style.\n\n"}
{"id": "8003100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8003100", "title": "Orroroo, South Australia", "text": "Orroroo, South Australia\n\nOrroroo is a town in the Yorke and Mid North region of South Australia. At the 2016 census, the locality of Orroroo had a population of 610 while its urban centre had a population of 537. The Wilmington-Ucolta Road passes through here, intersecting with the RM Williams Way which leads to the Birdsville and Oodnadatta Tracks. The Peterborough–Quorn railway line extended from Peterborough to Orroroo also in 1881 and Quorn in 1882, connecting with the new Central Australia Railway from Port Augusta. These railways have now been abandoned. Orroroo is situated near Goyder's Line, a line drawn up in 1865 by Surveyor General Goyder which he believed indicated the edge of the area suitable for agriculture.\n\nPrior to European settlement, Orroroo was the home of the Ngadjuri Aboriginal people whose domain was the area to the east of the Flinders Rangers. The name Orroroo was thought to be an form of onomatopoeia in imitation of wind blowing through acacia trees. According to J. Gray, it actually meant 'early start', referring to the fact that the Ngadjuri, who usually camped at Pekina Creek, would move to camp at the Orroroo river the night before hunting for kangaroos, which would come up to the river at that point and thus allow them to make an early start at dawn for the hunt. Aboriginal origins, but the true meaning of the word is uncertain. The name was first used by an early pioneer who conducted a nearby coaching house which served travellers on the Burra-Blinman track.\n\nIn 1844, the first Europeans to settle, John and James Chambers, took up the Pekina Run which covered 320 square miles. They did not receive a millimetre of rain during the 17 months that they lived there. As a result of this drought, they sold the Pekina Run for £30.\n\nCharlie Easther settled in Orroroo during 1864 and opened up an eating house that became a popular stopping point for the drovers and bullockys who travelled through the area. The town was surveyed in 1875, when Solly's Hut, a clay-pugged log structure, was constructed as the town's first house and is now used as a museum. In September 1875, the town was officially named by George Goyder following the suggestion made by Charlie Easther . The first land sales were made in May 1876. The town was granted its own local council, the District Council of Orroroo, in 1887 (taking effect in 1888(, and the town's council offices were constructed in 1888. The District Council of Orroroo would survive until 1997, when it was merged to create the District Council of Orroroo Carrieton.\n\nOn 24 August 1923, 230-volt electricity was connected to the town by Cr Martin Redden, Chairman of the District Council, in the presence of a large crowd. On 4 July 1962, the power house engines were shut down to change to AC power which gave the houses standard 240-volt power.\n\nAn early irrigation scheme was formed after damming the Pekina Creek and creating the Pekina reservoir. Water from here was supplied to over 50 dairy farms. Orroroo had its own flour mill, several bakeries, carriage manufacturer and a butter factory, which still stands.\n\nOrroroo is the service centre for a predominantly farming community with the main products being wheat, sheep, cattle, pigs and a kangaroo processor.\n\nA local curiosity is nearby, called \"Magnetic Hill\", which is a gravity hill optical illusion.\n\nThe town was connected by the Peterborough–Quorn railway line to Peterborough and Quorn in September 1881, and was served by a Class 1 station and a large Goods Shed. During 1962, concrete grain silos were built in the Yard. these provided the bulk of traffic until the railway was closed in 1987\n\nOrroroo was the last attended station on the railway; staff were withdrawn and the station operated as \"unattended\" from August 1981.\n\nPassenger services were discontinued during 1969, when the South Australian Railways withdrew the railcar service.\n\nGrain continued to be hauled by rail from Orroroo until 1987, when all rail services were withdrawn by Australian National. Steamtown, a railway preservation group based at Peterborough, operated passenger trains for tourists to Orroroo and Eurelia until 2002. The railway line was eventually removed in 2008.\n\nOrroroo is on the south-north RM Williams Way (route B80) connecting Clare to Hawker and the west-east route B56 connecting the Port Augusta to Broken Hill.\n\n\"Orroroo\" was officially named by a C.J. Easther, an early settler in the region. The \"Register\" of 16 November 1926 gives two still further alternatives, stating that Orroroo was the name of an Aboriginal girl who lived on nearby Pekina station, and that the town was for some reason named in honour of this girl, but also noting that others have suggested the name derivates from an Aboriginal word meaning 'dust', 'drift', or 'a windy locality'. It is true that in the \"Advertiser\" of 9 January 1903, it is said that \"orroroo\" means \"wind\" in \"the native language\". In the \"Advertiser\" of 15 August 1908, a still further derivation is suggested by a Gustav Degenhardt, who claims the name comes from the Aboriginal name for a nearby creek, \"Oorooroo\". Degenhardt resided in Orroroo from at least as early as 1880 (five years after Easther named the town), so it may be that he had first-hand knowledge of Easther's reasons for so naming the town.\n\nThe Orroroo Country Fire Service (CFS) is the volunteer fire service of Orroroo. They are part of the Black Rock CFS Group.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1017592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1017592", "title": "Robert Wilson (director)", "text": "Robert Wilson (director)\n\nRobert Wilson (born October 4, 1941) is an American experimental theater stage director and playwright who has been described by the media as \"[America]'s – or even the world's – foremost avant-garde 'theater artist. Over the course of his wide-ranging career, he has also worked as a choreographer, performer, painter, sculptor, video artist, and sound and lighting designer. \n\nHe is best known for his collaborations with Philip Glass on \"Einstein on the Beach\", and with numerous other artists, including Heiner Müller, William S. Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, Lou Reed, Tom Waits, David Byrne, Laurie Anderson, Gavin Bryars, Rufus Wainwright, Marina Abramović, Willem Dafoe, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Darryl Pinckney, Richard Gallo, and Lady Gaga. In 1991 Wilson established The Watermill Center, \"a laboratory for performance\" on the East End of Long Island, New York. He has received more commissions for new works in Europe than in the United States since the late 20th century, regularly working with opera and theatre companies, as well as cultural festivals.\n\nWilson was born in Waco, Texas, the son of Loree Velma (née Hamilton) and D.M. Wilson, a lawyer. After attending local schools, he studied business administration at the University of Texas from 1959 to 1962. \n\nHe moved to Brooklyn, New York in 1963 in order to change fields. He received a BFA in architecture from the Pratt Institute in 1966. During this period, he also attended lectures by Sibyl Moholy-Nagy (widow of László Moholy-Nagy), and studied painting with artist George McNeil. Later he went to Arizona to study architecture with Paolo Soleri at his desert complex.\n\nAfter moving to New York, Wilson found himself drawn to the work of pioneering choreographers George Balanchine, Merce Cunningham, and Martha Graham, among others. In 1968, he founded an experimental performance company, the Byrd Hoffman School of Byrds (named for a teacher who helped him overcome a severe stutter while a teenager). With this company, he directed his first major works, beginning with 1969's \"The King of Spain\" and \"The Life and Times of Sigmund Freud\". He began to work in opera in the early 1970s, creating \"Einstein on the Beach\" with composer Philip Glass. This work brought the two artists worldwide renown. Following \"Einstein\", Wilson worked increasingly with major European theaters and opera houses. For the New York debut of his first opera, the Metropolitan Opera allowed Wilson to rent the house on a Sunday, when they did not have a production, but would not produce the work. The house sold out in two days.\n\nIn 1972, Wilson's \"Deafman Glance\", a long, silent play, was premiered at the Nancy Festival in France. It later opened in Paris, championed by the designer Pierre Cardin. The Surrealist poet Louis Aragon loved it and published a letter to the Surrealist poet André Breton (who had died in 1966), in which he praised Wilson as: \"What we, from whom Surrealism was born, dreamed would come after us and go beyond us\".\n\nIn 1983/84, Wilson planned a performance for the 1984 Summer Olympics, \"the CIVIL warS: A Tree Is Best Measured When It Is Down\"; the complete work was to have been 12 hours long, in 6 parts. The production was only partially completed; the full event was cancelled by the Olympic Arts Festival, due to insufficient funds. In 1986, the Pulitzer Prize jury unanimously selected \"the CIVIL warS\" for the drama prize, but the supervisory board rejected the choice and gave no drama award that year.\n\nIn 1990 alone, Wilson created four new productions in four different West German cities: Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" in Frankfurt, Chekhov's \"Swan Song\" in Munich, an adaptation of Virginia Woolf's \"Orlando\" in West Berlin, and \"The Black Rider,\" a collaboration by Wilson, Tom Waits and William S. Burroughs, in Hamburg.\n\nWilson is known for pushing the boundaries of theatre. His works are noted for their austere style, very slow movement, and often extreme scale in space or in time. \"The Life and Times of Joseph Stalin\" was a 12-hour performance, while \"KA MOUNTain and GUARDenia Terrace\" was staged on a mountaintop in Iran and lasted seven days.\n\nIn 2010 Wilson was working on a new stage musical with composer (and long-time collaborator) Tom Waits and the Irish playwright, Martin McDonagh. His theatrical production of \"Lecture on Nothing\", which was commissioned for a celebration of the John Cage centenary at the 2012 Ruhrtriennale, had its U.S. premiere in Royce Hall, UCLA, by the Center for the Art of Performance.\n\nIn 2013 Wilson, in collaboration with Mikhail Baryshnikov and co-starring Willem Dafoe, developed \"The Old Woman\", an adaptation of the work by the Russian author Daniil Kharms. The play premiered at MIF13, Manchester International Festival. Wilson wrote that he and Baryshnikov had discussed creating a play together for years, perhaps based on a Russian text. The final production included dance, light, singing and bilingual monologue.\n\nSince 1999, Wilson has premiered nine theatrical works in Berlin. By contrast, as of 2013, his last commission in the United States was 21 years ago. \n\nHe continues to direct revivals of his most celebrated productions, including \"The Black Rider\" in London, San Francisco, Sydney, Australia, and Los Angeles; \"The Temptation of St. Anthony\" in New York and Barcelona; \"Erwartung\" in Berlin; \"Madama Butterfly\" at the Bolshoi Opera in Moscow; and Wagner's \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" at Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris. He also directs all Monteverdi operas for the opera houses of La Scala in Milan and the Palais Garnier in Paris.\n\nIn addition to his work for the stage, Wilson creates sculpture, drawings, and furniture designs. He won the Golden Lion at the 1993 Venice Biennale for a sculptural installation. Exhibited in December 1976 at the Paula Cooper Gallery, Wilson's storyboards were described by one critic as \"serial art, equivalent to the slow-motion tempo of [Wilson's] theatrical style. In drawing after drawing after drawing, a detail is proposed, analyzed, refined, redefined, moved through various positions.\"\n\nIn 2004, Ali Hossaini offered Wilson a residency at the television channel LAB HD. Since then Wilson, with producer Esther Gordon (and among others Brad Pitt, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Robert Downey, Jr., Winona Ryder, Juliette Binoche, Isabelle Huppert, Dita von Teese, and Peter Sarsgaard) and later with Matthew Shattuck, has produced dozens of high-definition videos known as the Voom Portraits. Collaborators on this well-received project included the composer Michael Galasso, the late artist and designer Eugene Tsai, fashion designer Kevin Santos, and lighting designer Urs Schönebaum. In addition to celebrity subjects, sitters have included royalty, animals, Nobel Prize winners and hobos.\n\nAmerican pop singer Lady Gaga announced in 2013 that she would collaborate with Wilson as part of her ARTPOP project. He subsequently designed the set for her 2013 MTV Video Music Awards performance.\n\nWilson also suggested that Gaga pose for his Voom Portraits. Knowing he had an upcoming residency as guest curator at the Louvre, Wilson chose themes from the museum's collection, all dealing with death. They shot the videos in a London studio over three days, Gaga standing for 14 or 15 hours at a time. Called \"Living Rooms,\" the resulting exhibition included two video works: one inspired by Jacques-Louis David's \"The Death of Marat\", hung in the painting galleries, and another in which Lady Gaga brings to life a painting by Ingres. In the Louvre's auditorium, Wilson hosted and took part in a series of performances, conversations, film screenings, and discussions. The centerpiece of the residency is a room filled with objects from the artist's personal collection in New York, including African masks, a Shaker chair, ancient Chinese ceramics, shoes worn by Marlene Dietrich and a photo of Wilson and Glass taken in the early 1980s by Robert Mapplethorpe.\n\nIn 2011, Wilson designed an art park dedicated to the Finnish designer Tapio Wirkkala (1915–1985), situated in the Arabianranta district of Helsinki. His plans for the rectangular park feature a central square divided into nine equally sized fields separated by bushes. Each field will be installed with objects related to the home. For example, one unit will consist of a small fireplace surrounded by stones that serve as seating. The park will be lit by large, lightbox-style lamps build into the ground and by smaller ones modelled on ordinary floor lamps.\n\nLanguage is one of the most important elements of theatre and Robert Wilson feels at home with commanding it in many different ways. Wilson's impact on this part of theatre alone is immense. Arthur Holmberg, Professor of Theatre at Brandeis University, says that \"In theatre, no one has dramatized the crisis of language with as much ferocious genius as Robert Wilson\". Wilson makes it evident in his work that what's and why's of language are terribly important and cannot be overlooked. Tom Waits, acclaimed songwriter and collaborator with Wilson, said this about Wilson's unique relationship with words:\n\nWords for Bob are like tacks on the kitchen floor in the dark of night and you're barefoot. So Bob clears a path he can walk through words without getting hurt. Bob changes the values and shapes of words. In some sense they take on more meaning; in some cases, less.\n\nWilson shows the importance of language through all of his works and in many varying fashions. He credits his reading of the work of Gertrude Stein and listening to recordings of her speaking with \"changing [his] way of thinking forever.\" Wilson directed three of Stein's works in the 1990s: \"Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights\" (1992), \"Four Saints in Three Acts\" (1996), and \"Saints and Singing\" (1998).\n\nWilson considers language and, down to its very ingredients, words, as a sort of \"a social artifact\". Not only does language change with time but it changes with person, with culture. Using his experience of working with mentally handicapped children and enlisting the collaboration of Christopher Knowles, a renowned autistic poet, has allowed Wilson attack language from many views. Wilson embraces this by often \"juxtaposing levels of diction – Miltonic opulence and contemporary ling, crib poetry and pre-verbal screams\" in an attempt to show his audience how elusive language really is and how ever-changing it can be. Visually showing words is another method Wilson uses to show the beauty of language. Often his set designs, program covers, and posters are graffiti'd with words. This allows the audience to look at the \"language itself\" rather than \"the objects and meanings it refers to.\".\n\nThe lack of language becomes essential to Wilson's work as well. In the same way an artist uses positive and negative space, Wilson uses noise and silence. In working on a production of \"King Lear\", Wilson inadvertently describes his necessity of silence:\n\nThe way actors are trained here is wrong. All they think about is interpreting a text. They worry about how to speak words and know nothing about their bodies. You see that by the way they walk. They don't understand the weight of a gesture in space. A good actor can command an audience by moving one finger.\n\nThis emphasis on silence is fully explored in some of his works. \"Deafman Glance\" is a play without words, and his adaptation of Heiner Müller's play \"\" contained a fifteen-minute wordless prologue. Holmberg describes these works stating, \n\nLanguage does many things and does them well. But we tend to shut our eyes to what language does not do well. Despite the arrogance of words – they rule traditional theatre with an iron fist – not all experience can be translated into a linguistic code.\n\nCelebrated twentieth century playwright Eugène Ionesco said that Wilson \"surpassed Beckett\" because \"[Wilson's] silence is a silence that speaks\". This silence onstage may be unnerving to audience members but serves a purpose of showing how important language is by its absence. It is Wilson's means of answering his own question: \"Why is it no one looks? Why is it no one knows how to look? Why does no one see anything on stage?\".\n\nAnother technique Wilson uses is that of what words can mean to a particular character. His piece, \"I was sitting on my patio this guy appeared I thought I was hallucinating\", features only two characters, both of whom deliver the same stream-of-consciousness monologue. In the play's first production one character was \"aloof, cold, [and] precise\" while the other \"brought screwball comedy… warmth and color… playful[ness]\". The different emphases and deliveries brought to the monologue two different meanings; \"audiences found it hard to believe they heard the same monologue twice\". Rather than tell his audience what words are supposed to mean, he opens them up for interpretation, presenting the idea that \"meanings are not tethered to words like horses to hitching posts\".\n\nMovement is another key element in Wilson's work. As a dancer, he sees the importance of the way an actor moves onstage and knows the weight their movement bears. When speaking of his \"play without words\" rendition of Ibsen's \"When We Dead Awaken\", Wilson says:\n\nI do movement before we work on the text. Later we'll put text and movement together. I do movement first to make sure it's strong enough to stand on its own two feet without words. The movement must have a rhythm and structure of its own. It must not follow the text. It can reinforce a text without illustrating it. What you hear and what you see are two different layers. When you put them together, you create another texture.\n\nWith such an emphasis on movement, Wilson even tailors his auditions around the necessity of it. In his auditions, \"Wilson often does an elaborate movement sequence\" and \"asks the actor to repeat it\". Thomas Derrah, an actor in \"the CIVIL warS\", found the audition process to be baffling: \"When I went in, [Wilson] asked me to walk across the room on a count of 31, sit down on a count of 7, put my hand to my forehead on a count of 59. I was mystified by the whole process\". To further cement the importance of movement in Wilson's works, Seth Goldstein, another actor in \"the CIVIL warS\", stated \"every movement from the moment I walked onto the platform until I left was choreographed to the second. During the scene at table all I did was count movements. All I thought about was timing\".\n\nWhen it comes time to add the text in with movement, there is still much work to be done. Wilson pays close attention to the text and still makes sure there is enough \"space around a text\" in order for the audience to soak it up. At this point, the actors know their movements and the time in which they are executed, allowing Wilson to tack the actions onto specific pieces of text. His overall goal is to have the rhythm of the text differ from that of the movement so his audience can see them as two completely different pieces, seeing each as what it is. When in the text/movement stage, Wilson often interrupts the rehearsal, saying things like \"Something is wrong. We have to check your scripts to see if you put the numbers in the right place\". He goes on to explain the importance of this:\n\nI know it's hell to separate text and movement and maintain two different rhythms. It takes time to train yourself to keep tongue and body working against each other. But things happen with the body that have nothing to do with what we say. It's more interesting if the mind and the body are in two different places, occupying different zones of reality.\n\nThese rhythms keep the mind on its toes, consciously and subconsciously taking in the meanings behind the movement and how it is matching up with the language.\n\nSimilar to Wilson's use of the lack of language in his works, he also sees the importance that a lack of movement can have. In his production of \"Medea\", Wilson arranged a scene in which the lead singer stood still during her entire song while many others moved around her. Wilson recalls that \"she complained that if I didn't give her any movements, no one would notice her. I told her if she knew how to stand, everyone would watch her. I told her to stand like a marble statue of a goddess who had been standing in the same spot for a thousand years\". Allowing an actor to have such stage presence without ever saying a word is very provocative, which is precisely what Wilson means to accomplish with any sense of movement he puts on the stage.\n\nWilson believes that, \"The most important part of theatre\" is light. He is concerned with how images are defined onstage, and this is related to the light of an object or tableau. He feels that the lighting design can really bring the production to life. The set designer for Wilson's \"\", Tom Kamm, describes his philosophy: \"a set for Wilson is a canvas for the light to hit like paint\". He explains, \"If you know how to light, you can make shit look like gold. I paint, I build, I compose with light. Light is a magic wand\".\n\nWilson is \"the only major director to get billing as a lighting designer\" and is recognized by some as \"the greatest light artist of our time\". He designs with light to be flowing rather than an off-and-on pattern, thus making his lighting \"like a musical score\". Wilson's lighting designs feature \"dense, palpable textures\" and allow \"people and objects to leap out from the background\". In his design for \"Quartett\", Wilson used four hundred light cues in a span of only ninety minutes.\n\nHe is a perfectionist, persisting to achieve every aspect of his vision. A fifteen-minute monologue in \"Quartett\" took two days for him to light while a single hand gesture took nearly three hours. This attention to detail expresses his conviction that, \"light is the most important actor on stage\".\n\nWilson's interest in design extends to the props in his productions, which he designs and sometimes participates in constructing. Whether it is furniture, a light bulb, or a giant crocodile, Wilson treats each as a work of art in its own right. He demands that a full-scale model of each prop be constructed before the final one is made, in order \"to check proportion, balance, and visual relationships\" on stage. Once he has approved the model, the crew builds the prop, and Wilson is \"renowned for sending them back again and again and again until they satisfy him\". He is so strict in his attention to detail that when Jeff Muscovin, his tech director for \"Quartett\", suggested they use an aluminum chair with a wood skin rather than a completely wooden chair, Wilson replied:\n\nNo, Jeff, I want wood chairs. If we make them out of aluminum, they won't sound right when they fall over and hit the floor. They'll sound like metal, not wood. It will sound false. Just make sure you get strong wood. And no knots.\n\nSuch attention to detail and perfectionism usually resulted in an expensive collection of props. \"Curators regard them as sculptures\", and the props have been sold for prices ranging from \"$4,500 to $80,000\".\n\nWilson is gay.\n\nIn 2007, Wilson was evicted from the Vestry Street loft he had lived and worked in for 34 years by developer Aby Rosen. That same year, he signed a lease at 111 Front Street.\n\nIn 2011, New York-based company International Flavors & Fragrances created a new scent, titled Black Rider, in Wilson's honor on the occasion of the director's 70th birthday.\n\nExtensive retrospectives have been presented at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris (1991) and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts (1991). He has presented installations at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, Museum Boymans-van Beuningen, Rotterdam (1993), London's Clink Street Vaults (1995), Neue Nationalgalerie (2003), and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York and the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. His tribute to Isamu Noguchi was exhibited at the Seattle Art Museum and his \"Voom Portraits\" exhibition traveled to Hamburg, Milan, Miami, and Philadelphia. In 2012, Times Square Arts invited Wilson to show selections from his three-minute video portraits on more than twenty digital screens that lined Times Square. In 2013 he participated at the White House Biennial / Thessaloniki Biennale 4.\n\nWilson is represented exclusively and worldwide by RW Work, Ltd. (New York), and his gallerist in New York City is Paula Cooper Gallery.\n\nIn 1991 Wilson established The Watermill Center on the site of a former Western Union laboratory on the East End of Long Island, New York. Originally styled as \"a laboratory for performance\", The Watermill Center now operates year-round artist residencies, public education programs, exhibitions, and performances. The Center is situated within a 10-acre campus of gardens and designed landscape, and contains numerous works of art collected by Wilson.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1230891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1230891", "title": "Rothko case", "text": "Rothko case\n\nThe Rothko case was the protracted legal dispute between Kate Rothko, the daughter of the painter Mark Rothko; the painter's estate executors; and the directors of his gallery, Marlborough Fine Art. The revelations in the case of greed, abuses of power and conspiracy by financial interests in the art world were described by the New York Court of Appeals, the highest court of New York state, as \"manifestly wrongful and indeed shocking,\" serving as a cautionary tale for both artists and their gallerists.\n\nThe entire Rothko matter involved few litigants, but many counsel, some of them with lengthy professional services over a period from 1971 to 1979. Proceedings included removal of the estate's original executors, setting aside the contracts those executors made with the Marlborough gallery, eliminating the rights of the gallery with respect to its inter vivos contracts with the artist, restoring hundreds of paintings to the artist's estate, removal proceedings to compensate the estate for paintings not returnable to it to the extent of millions of dollars, election proceedings litigating the rights of election by the children against an excessive charitable distribution, contents proceedings construing Mark Rothko's will as to the meaning of the \"contents\" of the family residence willed to his widow and to her estate and later by the widow's will to Rothko's children, and valuation proceedings for valuing the art, assessed costs, fees, and taxes.\n\nOn September 16, 1968, Rothko executed a two-page will, drafted by and its execution supervised by his friend Bernard Reis, an unlicensed law-school graduate and Certified Public Accountant, leaving all of his residual estate to the non-profit Rothko Foundation which Rothko organized shortly before his death.\n\nFive months later on February 21, 1969, Rothko entered into an agreement with Marlborough A.G., a Liechtenstein corporation with international galleries, which provided in part that he agreed \"not to sell any works of art for a period of eight years, except to Marlborough A.G. if a supplementary contract is made.\"\n\nOne year later Rothko died by suicide on February 25, 1970, leaving an estate consisting primarily but not entirely of 798 of his paintings. Rothko's wife Mary Alice died of a stroke six months after her husband's demise. Rothko's will was admitted to probate the month following his death, naming his estate executors: Bernard Reis, who had drafted Rothko's will and who became a Marlborough Gallery New York director the month before Rothko died; Theodoros Stamos, a friend and fellow artist represented by Marlborough New York starting in 1971; and Morton Levine, an anthropology professor, unconnected with Marlborough but who had been Rothko's son Christopher's guardian for a short time.\n\nShortly before his death in 1970, Rothko made gifts to his children of certain key paintings in his possession in an effort to provide his children with financial security, since he believed that key patrons would pay higher prices for the works following his death. However, after Rothko died, his children were notified by the Marlborough's founder, Frances Kenneth Lloyd, that under the terms of the agreement made with the gallery in 1966 and renewed in 1969, the gallery owned all of Rothko's paintings.\n\nFollowing Rothko's death the three executors for the estate agreed to sell 100 works to Marlborough for a total of $1,800,000 while a further 698 works were consigned to the gallery for sale at a fixed commission of 50%, however, the executors paid only $200,000 upfront to the estate. In the year after Rothko's death, the value of his work more than doubled while early works were selling at auction for over $80,000.\n\nIn 1971 Kate Rothko sued to release the estate from the sale agreement and have the paintings returned to the family. The legal proceedings revealed that when still a struggling artist with a young family, Rothko agreed to a deal with the gallery in which all of his paintings would be sold through the gallery in exchange for a set monthly fee. Such terms were not unheard of, as Pablo Picasso had had a similar deal with his gallery in the 1920s.\n\nIt emerged from the proceedings that the estate executors and the gallery defrauded Rothko and his estate through various methods of self-dealing. Among other wrongful acts, the gallery had been filtering payments for Rothko's works through accounts in Switzerland and Liechtenstein as part of an effort to ensure the paintings were undervalued during Rothko's lifetime — in the 1960s this led the artist to vastly underestimate the value of his works, directly resulting in his agreement to consignments of dozens of paintings to the gallery and collectors without appreciating his works' full value.\n\nThe trial record revealed that the gallery had been stockpiling the undervalued works instead of selling them in order to ensure both a low market saturation and a high Marlborough inventory, anticipating a heightened value in the market after Rothko's death. Further, the 100 paintings 'sold' after Rothko's death by the estate executors through Marlborough were not sold to bona fide purchasers, but were instead retained by the gallery which shuffled the sale monies through its accounts in Europe, and which then quickly 're-sold' the works to actual purchasers for 5 to 6 times the value declared by the estate. Many works were sold this way by the Marlborough with the complicity of the executors despite the court's injunction against selling any works while the case was unresolved and still before the courts.\n\nUltimately, certain directors at Marlborough were convicted of defrauding the Rothko family, and in 1975, the court ordered the gallery to pay over $9 million in damages and costs, and also ordered the gallery to return 658 Rothko paintings it still held. Marlborough disputed the return of the paintings and was able to prevail as to those works it had sold during the proceedings in defiance of the court's orders to the contrary. Those works remained in the hands of collectors, including Rothko's 1953 oil on canvas painting, \"Homage to Matisse\", which later sold at public auction for US $22.4 million.\n\nThe courts involved in litigating the Rothko matter were faced with many complex issues as part of and beyond the wrongdoing of the Marlborough group as estate executors. In particular, the valuation of services rendered by counsel were litigated at length; and the valuation of the paintings posed complex questions as their valuation affected nearly every other matter facing the court. In 1979 after much of the matter's litigation had already taken place, the court said:... <nowiki>[</nowiki>T<nowiki>]</nowiki>he bulk of the estate was and is in the form of hundreds of paintings rather than cash ... and ... <nowiki>[</nowiki>the<nowiki>]</nowiki> Internal Revenue Service may not at an early time complete its final determination with respect to date-of-death estate taxes. The estate is presently resisting a deficiency assessment of large proportions. In litigating that issue there is not only a difference of opinion with respect to the value of the hundreds of paintings in this estate but also whether a blockage discount should be given to the estate and whether a further discount should be available due to the inter vivos contract for an exclusive agency in favor of Marlborough Galleries for seven years after death, and finally whether a discount should be enjoyed by the estate for commissions which must be paid for selling many of the paintings by agents of the estate.\n<nowiki>[</nowiki>P<nowiki>]</nowiki>revailing counsel have participated in approximately 20,000 pages of transcript of pretrial and trial testimony; thousands of exhibits have been introduced and considered; thousands of pages of briefs have been submitted to this court and to the appellate courts; many decisions were made in this court, pretrial as well as the ultimate disposition; the Appellate Division has ruled on these matters several times; and the Court of Appeals has finally unanimously affirmed the major disposition made in this court, (43 N.Y.2d 305, 401 N.Y.S.2d 449, 372 N.E.2d 291).\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service audited the Rothko Foundation and determined that Mark Rothko's former friend and ex-estate executor Bernard Reis was liable for various self-dealing excise taxes under section 4941 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (IRS code) for the years 1970 through 1974 in the total amount of $18,582,500, and additions to tax under sections 6651 and 6684 for the same years in the respective total amounts of $518,125 and $2,112,500. Reis' estate (he was dead by that time) lost its summary judgment motion to make the ruling go away.\n\nDespite Theodoros Stamos protestations that he had done nothing wrong, the Tax Court also ruled against him for liability for various self-dealing excise taxes under IRS code section 4941 for the years 1970 through 1976 in the total amount of $19,407,500, and additions to tax under sections 6651(a)(1) and 6684 for the same years in the respective total amounts of $724,375 and $2,957,500. Stamos also lost his appeal.\n\nMarlborough A.G.'s founder Frank Lloyd paid a third of the $9.2 million award to the Rothko children as a fine against Marlborough for violating the court's injunction against the sale of any further paintings before a final ruling or settlement. The disgraced Lloyd is not mentioned as active after 1972 on the gallery history page on Marlborough's website. Lloyd died in 1998 at age 86.\n\n\nThirteen years after his death, Mark Rothko's tale aired as a television movie: \"The Rothko Conspiracy,\" a co-production of the BBC and Lionheart Television. The filmmakers based their work on the 1978 book, \"The Legacy of Mark Rothko\", on interviews and the trial transcripts.\n\n\n"}
