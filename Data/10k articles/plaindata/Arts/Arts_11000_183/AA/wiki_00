The five artists whose work was shown were Aleksandra Ekster, Lyubov Popova, Alexander Rodchenko, Varvara Stepanova and Alexander Vesnin. They presented highly abstracted, geometric work that rejected expressionist forms of painting common before the World War I and pretended to be the \"end\" or \"death\" of art.\n\nRodchenko presented three canvases of a single colour (red, yellow and blue). He saw that his formal research into Constructivism had reached completion at this point, and claimed that he had demonstrated the \"end of painting\". The exhibition has been considered an anti-painting manifesto.\n\nLyubov Popova showed canvasses almost bare, puzzling viewers and provoking hail from the critics. Her \"flight from painting\" influenced Wassily Kandinsky, Mark Rothko and Ad Reinhardt. Popova herself did not regard her works as \"the end\"; on the contrary, she wrote, \"all pieces presented here should be regarded as merely preparations for concrete construction\".\n\nAlexander Vesnin presented five abstract cubist canvases that appear pure abstractions but were, in fact, ultimate decomposition of human figures. Vesnin's catalogue cover, in particular, is typical of his book and advertising art of the period: numbers in two \"lines\" (5x5 and 25) are offset against the baseline, but this irregularity is \"disguised\" by angled lines dissecting the space.\n\nCatalogues of the exhibition were hand-drawn by the artists and contained original artwork that has never been displayed publicly. At least ten unique albums survive in Russia to date. The 1921 show was reconstructed in 2009 in London's Tate Gallery. Modern critics remain divided over the question of whether \"death of painting\" was a genuine statement of modern art or, indeed, it was a dead end with no future.\n\n"}

It is a non-profit organization. It focuses on world music. In 2011 it was voted the best place to dance by readers of \"East Bay Express\".\n\nAshkenaz opened in 1973 and was founded by performance artist and activist David Nadel. After relocating from Los Angeles to attend University of California, Berkeley, Nadel formed a dance troupe. The troupe started renting spaces on San Pablo Avenue. Nadel, along with six other people, would go on to buy the building where Ashkenaz is located today. He named the organization after his Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. The original building was a series of old retail shops. Nadel and friends built the wooden facade that is seen today. It is supposed to resemble an Eastern European synagogue. It totals 5,000 square feet. In 1993, the city of Berkeley named the Ashkenaz a city landmark.\n\nIn 1996 a drunken patron was kicked out of the club by Nadel. The patron threatened to shoot Nadel. The man returned after Nadel closed the club for the evening and shot Nadel point blank in the head. Nadel died from the gunshot wound at the hospital and the man was never found. In wake of Nadel dying, a group of Ashkenaz patrons bought it, and then formed it into a nonprofit. It re-opened six months later, on June 21, 1997.\n\nIt caters to world music, both local and international. Music genres range from hip-hop to Cajun music. They also host events focused around Judaism, including holiday celebrations and klezmer concerts. The majority of concerts start with a dance lessons based around the style or genre of the music. They host benefits for local organizations and activists, such as the American Indian Movement and Nature Conservancy. The organization aims to be a zero waste business. They recycle everything and provide customers glasses of water instead of water bottles. They have a television program on Berkeley Community Television called \"Ashkenaz Live,\" where they showcase performances and history of the performers genres. Ashkenaz has a live children's program where musicians play to local children on Sundays. The venue has a stage, alcohol serving bar, a dance studio, and a vegetarian restaurant. A space upstairs where Nadel used to live is an office space.\n\n"}
{"id": "344913", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=344913", "title": "Asymmetry", "text": "Asymmetry\n\nAsymmetry is the absence of, or a violation of, symmetry (the property of an object being invariant to a transformation, such as reflection). Symmetry is an important property of both physical and abstract systems and it may be displayed in precise terms or in more aesthetic terms. The absence of or violation of symmetry that are either expected or desired can have important consequences for a system.\n\nDue to how cells divide in organisms, asymmetry in organisms is fairly usual in at least one dimension, with biological symmetry also being common in at least one dimension.\n\nLouis Pasteur proposed that biological molecules are asymmetric because the cosmic [i.e. physical] forces that preside over their formation are themselves asymmetric. While at his time, and even now, the symmetry of physical processes are highlighted, it is known that there are fundamental physical asymmetries, starting with time.\n\nAsymmetry is an important and widespread trait, having evolved numerous times in many organisms and at many levels of organisation (ranging from individual cells, through organs, to entire body-shapes). Benefits of asymmetry sometimes have to do with improved spatial arrangements, such as the left human lung being smaller, and having one fewer lobes than the right lung to make room for the asymmetrical heart. In other examples, division of function between the right and left half may have been beneficial and has driven the asymmetry to become stronger. Such an explanation is usually given for mammal hand or paw preference (Handedness), an asymmetry in skill development in mammals. Training the neural pathways in a skill with one hand (or paw) may take less effort than doing the same with both hands.\n\nNature also provides several examples of handedness in traits that are usually symmetric. The following are examples of animals with obvious left-right asymmetries:\n\n\n\n\nSince birth defects and injuries are likely to indicate poor health of the organism, defects resulting in asymmetry often put an animal at a disadvantage when it comes to finding a mate. In particular, a degree of facial symmetry is associated with physical attractiveness, but complete symmetry is both impossible and probably unattractive.\n\nPre-modern architectural styles tended to place an emphasis on symmetry, except where extreme site conditions or historical developments lead away from this classical ideal. To the contrary, modernist and postmodern architects became much more free to use asymmetry as a design element.\n\nWhile most bridges employ a symmetrical form due to intrinsic simplicities of design, analysis and fabrication and economical use of materials, a number of modern bridges have deliberately departed from this, either in response to site-specific considerations or to create a dramatic design statement.\n\nSome asymmetrical structures\nIn fire-resistance rated wall assemblies, used in passive fire protection, including, but not limited to, high-voltage transformer fire barriers, asymmetry is a crucial aspect of design. When designing a facility, it is not always certain, that in the event of fire, which \"side\" a fire may come from. Therefore, many building codes and fire test standards outline, that a symmetrical assembly, need only be tested from one side, because both sides are the same. However, as soon as an assembly is asymmetrical, both sides must be tested and the test report is required to state the results for each side. In practical use, the lowest result achieved is the one that turns up in certification listings. Neither the test sponsor, nor the laboratory can go by an opinion or deduction as to which side was in more peril as a result of contemplated testing and then test only one side. Both must be tested in order to be compliant with test standards and building codes\n\nThere are no \"a\" and \"b\" such that \"a\" < \"b\" and \"b\" < \"a\". This form of asymmetry is an asymmetrical relation.\n\nCertain molecules are chiral; that is, they cannot be superposed upon their mirror image. Chemically identical molecules with different chirality are called \"enantiomers\"; this difference in orientation can lead to different properties in the way they react with biological systems.\n\nAsymmetry arises in physics in a number of different realms.\n\nThe original non-statistical formulation of thermodynamics was asymmetrical in time: it claimed that the entropy in a closed system can only increase with time. This was derived from the Second Law (any of the two, Clausius' or Lord Kelvin's statement can be used since they are equivalent) and using the Clausius' Theorem (see Kerson Huang ). The later theory of statistical mechanics, however, is symmetric in time. Although it states that a system significantly below maximum entropy is very likely to evolve \"towards\" higher entropy, it also states that such a system is very likely to have evolved \"from\" higher entropy.\n\nSymmetry is one of the most powerful tools in particle physics, because it has become evident that practically all laws of nature originate in symmetries. Violations of symmetry therefore present theoretical and experimental puzzles that lead to a deeper understanding of nature. Asymmetries in experimental measurements also provide powerful handles that are often relatively free from background or systematic uncertainties.\n\nUntil the 1950s, it was believed that fundamental physics was left-right symmetric; i.e., that interactions were invariant under parity. Although parity is conserved in electromagnetism, strong interactions and gravity, it turns out to be violated in weak interactions. The Standard Model incorporates parity violation by expressing the weak interaction as a chiral gauge interaction. Only the left-handed components of particles and right-handed components of antiparticles participate in weak interactions in the Standard Model. A consequence of parity violation in particle physics is that neutrinos have only been observed as left-handed particles (and antineutrinos as right-handed particles).\n\nIn 1956-1957 Chien-Shiung Wu, E. Ambler, R. W. Hayward, D. D. Hoppes, and R. P. Hudson found a clear violation of parity conservation in the beta decay of cobalt-60. Simultaneously, R. L. Garwin, Leon Lederman, and R. Weinrich modified an existing cyclotron experiment and immediately verified parity violation.\n\nAfter the discovery of the violation of parity in 1956-57, it was believed that the combined symmetry of parity (P) and simultaneous charge conjugation (C), called \"CP\", was preserved. For example, CP transforms a left-handed neutrino into a right-handed antineutrino. In 1964, however, James Cronin and Val Fitch provided clear evidence that CP symmetry was also violated in an experiment with neutral kaons.\n\nCP violation is one of the necessary conditions for the generation of a baryon asymmetry in the universe.\n\nCombining the CP symmetry with simultaneous time reversal (T) produces a combined symmetry called CPT symmetry. CPT symmetry must be preserved in any Lorentz invariant local quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian. As of 2006, no violations of CPT symmetry have been observed.\n\nThe baryons (i.e., the protons and neutrons and the atoms that they comprise) observed so far in the universe are overwhelmingly matter as opposed to anti-matter. This asymmetry is called the baryon asymmetry of the universe.\n\nIsospin is the symmetry transformation of the weak interactions. The concept was first introduced by Werner Heisenberg in nuclear physics based on the observations that the masses of the neutron and the proton are almost identical and that the strength of the strong interaction between any pair of nucleons is the same, independent of whether they are protons or neutrons. This symmetry arises at a more fundamental level as a symmetry between up-type and down-type quarks. Isospin symmetry in the strong interactions can be considered as a subset of a larger flavor symmetry group, in which the strong interactions are invariant under interchange of different types of quarks. Including the strange quark in this scheme gives rise to the Eightfold Way scheme for classifying mesons and baryons.\n\nIsospin is violated by the fact that the masses of the up and down quarks are different, as well as by their different electric charges. Because this violation is only a small effect in most processes that involve the strong interactions, isospin symmetry remains a useful calculational tool, and its violation introduces corrections to the isospin-symmetric results.\n\nBecause the weak interactions violate parity, collider processes that can involve the weak interactions typically exhibit asymmetries in the distributions of the final-state particles. These asymmetries are typically sensitive to the \"difference\" in the interaction between particles and antiparticles, or between left-handed and right-handed particles. They can thus be used as a sensitive measurement of differences in interaction strength and/or to distinguish a small asymmetric signal from a large but symmetric background.\n\nAsymmetry is also relevant to grammar and linguistics, especially in the contexts of lexical analysis and transformational grammar.\n\nEnumeration example:\nIn English, there are grammatical rules for specifying coordinate items in an enumeration or series. Similar rules exist for programming languages and mathematical notation. These rules vary, and some require lexical asymmetry to be considered grammatically correct.\n\nFor example, in standard written English:\n\n\n"}

It was the second in importance, after the Gobelins Manufactory, of French tapestry workshops that were established under the general direction of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the finance minister of Louis XIV. Whereas the royal Gobelins Manufactory executed tapestries for the royal residences and as ambassadorial gifts, the manufacture at Beauvais remained a private enterprise. Beauvais specialised in low-warp tapestry weaving, although the letters patent of 1664, authorising the company and offering royal protection, left the field open for the production of high-warp tapestry as well. \n\nThe first entrepreneur, Louis Hinard, a native of Beauvais who had already established workshops in Paris, produced unambitious floral and foliate tapestries called \"verdures\" and landscape tapestries, which are known through chance notations in royal accounts. He was arrested for his debts in 1684, and the workshops were refounded more successfully under Philippe Behagle, a merchant tapestry-manufacturer from Oudenarde, who had also worked in the traditional tapestry-weaving city of Tournai. Behagle's first successes were a suite of \"Conquests of the King\" which complemented a contemporaneous Gobelins suite showing episodes in the \"Life of the King\", without directly competing with them. A suite of \"Acts of the Apostles\", following copies of Raphael's cartoons, are in the cathedral of Beauvais. The so-called \"Teniers\" tapestries, in the manner of village scenes painted by David Teniers the Younger, began to be woven under Behagle and continued popular, with up-dated borders, into the eighteenth century, when the earliest series of archives begin.\n\nThe great series of \"Grotesques\" (\"illustration, left\") initiated in the 1690s became a mainstay of Beauvais production, woven through the Régence. The cartoons, which were inspired by the engravings of the elder Jean Bérain and were carried out to cartoons by Jean-Baptiste Monnoyer, a painter attached to the Gobelins factory, were based on fanciful \"grotteschi\". Against mustard yellow grounds vases and baskets of fruit with birds, a specialty of Monnoyer's, are contrasted with lively figures, sometimes acrobats and dancers, sometimes from the \"Commedia dell'arte\" in slender and fanciful \"arabesque\" architecture. \n\nBehagle continued his private workshops in Paris, as had his predecessor. From these shops came the suite of \"Marine Triumphs\" with the arms of the comte de Toulouse. On his death in 1705, the Beauvais manufacture was continued by his wife and son, and in 1711 by new proprietors, the brothers Filleul. Under Filleul ownership Beauvais produced suites of \"The story of Telemachus\" and Ovidian \"Metamorphoses\" as well as animal combats, and a series of \"Chinese\" hangings that are a high point in the career of chinoiserie. Between 1722 and 1726, Beauvais was directed by Noël-Antoine de Mérou, and maintained showrooms in Paris, and in Leipzig and Ratisbon (Regensburg), for Beauvais found many commissions among foreigners.\n\nThe great period of Beauvais tapestry begins with the arrival of Jean-Baptiste Oudry, 22 July 1726, replacing the unsatisfactory Jacques Duplessis. When Mérou was dismissed in 1734 for falsifying the accounts, for the first time the manufacture was directed by an artist, since Oudry's financial backer, Nicolas Besnier, a goldsmith of Paris, was wise enough not to interfere with the artistic production, and the partnership lasted until 1753. Oudry was simultaneously inspector of the works at Gobelins. At Beauvais he reorganized the training of the young workers and turned out designs and constantly renewed borders: the \"New Hunts\", the suite of \"Country Pleasures\", the hangings illustrating Molière's comedies, a renewed suite of perennially popular \"Metamorphoses\". Sets of tapestry covers for seat furniture were introduced, and in September 1737 it was decided that the King of France should purchase two sets of tapestry each year, for 10,000 \"livres\", for gifts to foreign ministers, an advertisement of French hegemony in the field of art and also a fine advertisement for the quality of the Beauvais manufacture. The king had the entire production of Gobelins at his disposal, but as Edith Standen points out, they were rather large, rather solemn and definitely old-fashioned. In 1739, for the first time, cartoons for Beauvais were exhibited at the Paris salon, another way of keeping the tapestry workshops before the public eye.\n\nOudry turned to other artists to supplement the tapestry cartoons he was producing; from Charles-Joseph Natoire's designs Beauvais wove the suite of \"Don Quichotte\", and from François Boucher, starting in 1737, a long series of six suites of tapestry hangings, forty-five subjects in all, constituting the familiar \"Boucher-Beauvais\" suites that embody the rococo style: the \"Fêtes Italiennes\", a set of village festivals in settings evoking the Roman Campagna, the \"Nobles Pastorales\", a further suite of six chinoiseries, now in a lighter, Rococo handling. Boucher's eight oil sketches for these \"Tentures chinoises\" were shown in the Salon of 1742;. It was unusual for the artist's sketches to be enlarged to provide cartoons, as in this case; the translation to cartoons was made by Jean-Joseph Dumons de Tulle. The successful series was woven at Beauvais at least ten times between July 1743 and August 1775; in addition further copies were made at Aubusson. \n\nBoucher also designed for Beauvais the \"Story of Psyche\" and at the apex of the lot, the \"Amours des Dieux\", the \"Loves of the Gods\", after paintings by Boucher delivered 1747-49; suites from among the nine subjects, though never all subjects in one suite, were being woven at Beauvais as late as 1774.\n\nA new partner, André-Charlemagne Charron, and increased royal support, with annual order for sets of hangings now with complete suites of furniture coverings, to be delivered to the Garde-Meuble de la Couronne or the foreign ministry should have launched new successes for Beauvais, but Oudry's death, 30 April 1755, and Boucher's defection to the Gobelins the same year, initiated a period of stagnation, while the old designs were repeated, and then decline. At the French Revolution the workshops were temporarily closed, following a dispute between the weavers and the administration, and then were reopened, under State direction, making little but upholstery covers.\n\n\n"}

It is directed by Singaporean first-time filmmakers Jeremy Boo and Lee Xian Jie, who have also started an online platform that encourages people in Asia to share their experiences about dementia.\n\nThe film tells the story of Joyce Fernandez, a 50-year-old woman caring for her mother, Celine Fernandez, who has had Alzheimer's Disease for 7 years. When Celine suffers a mild stroke and is hospitalized for over three months, Joyce attempts to keep herself together, especially after Celine loses all of what little speech and she originally had. The duo, staunch Catholics, keep their heads above the emotional turmoil through daily prayer.\n\nThe documentary also captures frank interviews with Dr Irene Giam (PhD), a former mathematics tutor and atheist, with strong views about death in the face of terminal illness. She is first filmed after being diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, likely due to systemic fibrosis, an autoimmune disorder which affects her breathing. After she is warded in a hospice because of her rapidly worsening health, vascular dementia causes her to forget the frequent visits by her husband and deepens her feelings of loneliness.\n\n"}

{"id": "53682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53682", "title": "Calligraphy", "text": "Calligraphy\n\nCalligraphy (from Greek: καλλιγραφία) is a visual art related to writing. It is the design and execution of lettering with a broad tip instrument, brush, or other writing instruments. A contemporary calligraphic practice can be defined as \"the art of giving form to signs in an expressive, harmonious, and skillful manner\".\n\nModern calligraphy ranges from functional inscriptions and designs to fine-art pieces where the letters may or may not be readable. Classical calligraphy differs from typography and non-classical hand-lettering, though a calligrapher may practice both.\n\nCalligraphy continues to flourish in the forms of wedding invitations and event invitations, font design and typography, original hand-lettered logo design, religious art, announcements, graphic design and commissioned calligraphic art, cut stone inscriptions, and memorial documents. It is also used for props and moving images for film and television, and also for testimonials, birth and death certificates, maps, and other written works.\n\nThe principal tools for a calligrapher are the pen and the brush. Calligraphy pens write with nibs that may be flat, round, or pointed. For some decorative purposes, multi-nibbed pens—steel brushes—can be used. However, works have also been created with felt-tip and ballpoint pens, although these works do not employ angled lines. There are some styles of calligraphy, such as Gothic script, that require a stub nib pen.\n\nWriting ink is usually water-based and is much less viscous than the oil-based inks used in printing. High quality paper, which has good consistency of absorption, enables cleaner lines, although parchment or vellum is often used, as a knife can be used to erase imperfections and a light-box is not needed to allow lines to pass through it. Normally, light boxes and templates are used to achieve straight lines without pencil markings detracting from the work. Ruled paper, either for a light box or direct use, is most often ruled every quarter or half inch, although inch spaces are occasionally used. This is the case with \"litterea unciales\" (hence the name), and college-ruled paper often acts as a guideline well.\n\nCommon calligraphy pens and brushes are:\n\nWestern calligraphy is recognizable by the use of the Latin script. The Latin alphabet appeared about 600 BC, in Rome, and by the first century developed into Roman imperial capitals carved on stones, Rustic capitals painted on walls, and Roman cursive for daily use. In the second and third centuries the uncial lettering style developed. As writing withdrew to monasteries, uncial script was found more suitable for copying the Bible and other religious texts. It was the monasteries which preserved calligraphic traditions during the fourth and fifth centuries, when the Roman Empire fell and Europe entered the Dark Ages.\n\nAt the height of the Empire, its power reached as far as Great Britain; when the empire fell, its literary influence remained. The Semi-uncial generated the Irish Semi-uncial, the small Anglo-Saxon. Each region developed its own standards following the main monastery of the region (i.e. Merovingian script, Laon script, Luxeuil script, Visigothic script, Beneventan script), which are mostly cursive and hardly readable.\nChristian churches promoted the development of writing through the prolific copying of the Bible, the Breviary, and other sacred texts. Two distinct styles of writing known as uncial and half-uncial (from the Latin \"uncia\", or \"inch\") developed from a variety of Roman bookhands. The 7th-9th centuries in northern Europe were the heyday of Celtic illuminated manuscripts, such as the Book of Durrow, Lindisfarne Gospels and the Book of Kells.\n\nCharlemagne's devotion to improved scholarship resulted in the recruiting of \"a crowd of scribes\", according to Alcuin, the Abbot of York. Alcuin developed the style known as the Caroline or Carolingian minuscule. The first manuscript in this hand was the Godescalc Evangelistary (finished 783)—a Gospel book written by the scribe Godescalc. Carolingian remains the one progenitor hand from which modern booktype descends.\n\nIn the eleventh century, the Caroline evolved into the Gothic script, which was more compact and made it possible to fit more text on a page. The Gothic calligraphy styles became dominant throughout Europe; and in 1454, when Johannes Gutenberg developed the first printing press in Mainz, Germany, he adopted the Gothic style, making it the first typeface.\nIn the 15th century, the rediscovery of old Carolingian texts encouraged the creation of the humanist minuscule or \"littera antiqua\". The 17th century saw the Batarde script from France, and the 18th century saw the English script spread across Europe and world through their books.\n\nIn the mid-1600s French officials, flooded with documents written in various hands and varied levels of skill, complained that many such documents were beyond their ability to decipher. The Office of the Financier thereupon restricted all legal documents to three hands, namely the Coulee, the Rhonde, (known as Round hand in English) and a Speed Hand sometimes simply called the Bastarda.\n\nWhile there were many great French masters at the time, the most influential in proposing these hands was Louis Barbedor, who published \"Les Ecritures Financière Et Italienne Bastarde Dans Leur Naturel\" circa 1650.\n\nWith the destruction of the Camera Apostolica during the sack of Rome (1527), the capitol for writing masters moved to Southern France. By 1600, the Italic Cursiva began to be replaced by a technological refinement, the Italic Chancery Circumflessa, which in turn fathered the Rhonde and later English Roundhand.\n\nIn England, Ayres and Banson popularized the Round Hand while Snell is noted for his reaction to them, and warnings of restraint and proportionality. Still Edward Crocker began publishing his copybooks 40 years before the aforementioned.\n\nSacred Western calligraphy has some special features, such as the illumination of the first letter of each book or chapter in medieval times. A decorative \"carpet page\" may precede the literature, filled with ornate, geometrical depictions of bold-hued animals. The Lindisfarne Gospels (715–720 AD) are an early example.\n\nAs with Chinese or Islamic calligraphy, Western calligraphic script employed the use of strict rules and shapes. Quality writing had a rhythm and regularity to the letters, with a \"geometrical\" order of the lines on the page. Each character had, and often still has, a precise stroke order.\n\nUnlike a typeface, irregularity in the characters' size, style, and colors increases aesthetic value, though the content may be illegible. Many of the themes and variations of today's contemporary Western calligraphy are found in the pages of The Saint John's Bible. A particularly modern example is Timothy Botts' illustrated edition of the Bible, with 360 calligraphic images as well as a calligraphy typeface.\n\nSeveral other Western styles use the same tools and practices, but differ by character set and stylistic preferences.\nFor Slavonic lettering, the history of the Slavonic and consequently Russian writing systems differs fundamentally from the one of the Latin language. It evolved from the 10th century to today.\n\nThe Chinese name for calligraphy is ' ( in Traditional Chinese, literally \"the method or law of writing\"); the Japanese name ' (, literally \"the way or principle of writing\"); and the Korean name being \"\" (/, literally \"the art of writing\"). The calligraphy of East Asian characters is an important and appreciated aspect of traditional East Asian culture.\n\nIn ancient China, the oldest Chinese characters existing are Jiǎgǔwén characters (甲骨文) carved on ox scapulae and tortoise plastrons, because the dominators in Shang Dynasty carved pits on such animals' bones and then baked them to gain auspice of military affairs, agricultural harvest, or even procreating and weather. During the divination ceremony, after the cracks were made, the characters were written with a brush on the shell or bone to be later carved. (Keightley, 1978). With the development of \"Jīnwén\" (Bronzeware script) and \"Dàzhuàn\" (Large Seal Script) \"cursive\" signs continued. Mao Gong Ding is one of the most famous and typical Bronzeware scripts in the Chinese calligraphy history. It has 500 characters on the bronze which is the largest number of bronze inscription we have discovered so far. . Moreover, each archaic kingdom of current China had its own set of characters. \n\nIn Imperial China, the graphs on old steles—some dating from 200 BC, and in Xiaozhuan style—are still accessible.\n\nAbout 220 BC, the emperor Qin Shi Huang, the first to conquer the entire Chinese basin, imposed several reforms, among them Li Si's character unification, which created a set of 3300 standardized \"\" characters. Despite the fact that the main writing implement of the time was already the brush, few papers survive from this period, and the main examples of this style are on steles.\n\nThe Lìshū style (/)(clerical script) which is more regularized, and in some ways similar to modern text, have been also authorised under Qin Shi Huangdi.\n\nBetween clerical script and traditional regular script, there is another transition type of calligraphy works called Wei Bei. It had started at the South and North dynasty and ended before Tang Dynasty. \n\nKǎishū style (traditional regular script)—still in use today—and attributed to Wang Xizhi (, 303–361) and his followers, is even more regularized. Its spread was encouraged by Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang (926–933), who ordered the printing of the classics using new wooden blocks in Kaishu. Printing technologies here allowed a shape stabilization. The Kaishu shape of characters 1000 years ago was mostly similar to that at the end of Imperial China. But small changes have been made, for example in the shape of which is not absolutely the same in the Kangxi Dictionary of 1716 as in modern books. The Kangxi and current shapes have tiny differences, while stroke order is still the same, according to old style.\n\nStyles which did not survive include Bāfēnshū, a mix made of Xiaozhuan style at 80%, and Lishu at 20%.\nSome variant Chinese characters were unorthodox or locally used for centuries. They were generally understood but always rejected in official texts. Some of these unorthodox variants, in addition to some newly created characters, compose the Simplified Chinese character set.\n\nTraditional East Asian writing uses the Four Treasures of the Study (/): the ink brushes known as máobǐ (/) to write Chinese characters, Chinese ink, paper, and inkstone, known as the \"Four Friends of the Study\" () in Korea. In addition to these four tools, desk pads and paperweights are also used.\n\nThe shape, size, stretch, and hair type of the ink brush, the color, color density and water density of the ink, as well as the paper's water absorption speed and surface texture are the main physical parameters influencing the final result. The calligrapher's technique also influences the result. The calligrapher's work is influenced by the quantity of ink and water he lets the brush take, then by the pressure, inclination, and direction he gives to the brush, producing thinner or bolder strokes, and smooth or toothed borders. Eventually, the speed, accelerations, decelerations of the writer's moves, turns, and crochets, and the stroke order give the \"spirit\" to the characters, by greatly influencing their final shapes.\n\nCursive styles such as \"\" (/)(semi-cursive or running script) and \"\" (/)(cursive, rough script, or grass script) are less constrained and faster, where more movements made by the writing implement are visible. These styles' stroke orders vary more, sometimes creating radically different forms. They are descended from Clerical script, in the same time as Regular script (Han Dynasty), but ' and ' were used for personal notes only, and never used as a standard. The \"\" style was highly appreciated in Emperor Wu of Han reign (140–187 AD).\n\nExamples of modern printed styles are Song from the Song Dynasty's printing press, and sans-serif. These are not considered traditional styles, and are normally not written.\n\nBoth Japanese and Korean calligraphy were greatly influenced by Chinese calligraphy. The Japanese and Korean people have also developed their own specific sensibilities and styles of calligraphy while incorporating Chinese influences. For example, Japanese calligraphy go out of the set of CJK strokes to also include local alphabets such as hiragana and katakana, with specific problematics such as new curves and moves, and specific materials (Japanese paper, \"\" , and Japanese ink). In the case of Korean calligraphy, the Hangeul and the existence of the circle required the creation of a new technique which usually confuses Chinese calligraphers.\n\nTemporary calligraphy is a practice of water-only calligraphy on the floor, which dries out within minutes. This practice is especially appreciated by the new generation of retired Chinese in public parks of China. These will often open studio-shops in tourist towns offering traditional Chinese calligraphy to tourists. Other than writing the clients name, they also sell fine brushes as souvenirs and lime stone carved stamps.\n\nSince late 1980s, a few Chinese artists have branched out traditional Chinese calligraphy to a new territory by mingling Chinese characters with English letters; notable new forms of calligraphy are Xu Bing's square calligraphy and DanNie's coolligraphy or cooligraphy.\n\nMongolian calligraphy is also influenced by Chinese calligraphy, from tools to style.\n\nCalligraphy has influenced ink and wash painting, which is accomplished using similar tools and techniques. Calligraphy has influenced most major art styles in East Asia, including ink and wash painting, a style of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean based entirely on calligraphy.\n\nThe Philippines has numerous indigenous scripts collectively called as suyat. Various ethno-linguistic groups in the Philippines prior to Spanish colonization in the 16th century up to the independence era in the 21st century have used the scripts with various mediums. By the end of colonialism, only four of the suyat scripts survived and continue to be used by certain communities in everyday life. These four scripts are hanunó'o/hanunoo of the Hanuno'o Mangyan people, buhid/buid of the Buhid Mangyan people, apurahuano/tagbanwa of the Tagbanwa people, and palaw'an/pala'wan of the Palaw'an people. All four scripts were inscribed in the UNESCO Memory of the World Programme, under the name \"Philippine Paleographs (Hanunoo, Buid, Tagbanua and Pala’wan)\", in 1999.\nDue to dissent from colonialism, many artists and cultural experts have revived the usage of suyat scripts that went extinct due to Spanish persecution. These scripts being revived include the kulitan script of the Kapampangan people, the badlit script of various Visayan ethnic groups, the iniskaya script of the Eskaya people, the baybayin script of the Tagalog people, and the kur-itan script of the Ilocano people, among many others. Due to the diversity of suyat scripts, all calligraphy written in suyat scripts are collectively called as Filipino suyat calligraphy, although each are distinct from each other. Calligraphy using the Western alphabet and the Arabic alphabet are also prevalent in the Philippines due to its colonial past, but the Western alphabet and the Arabic alphabet are not considered as suyat, and therefore Western-alphabet and Arabic calligraphy are not considered as suyat calligraphy.\n\nSanskrit is the primary form of Thai calligraphy. Historically Thai calligraphy has been limited to sacred texts of the Pali Canon with few wider artistic applications where graphic calligraphy representing figures and objects is produced. Calligraphy appears on the personal flag of each member of the Thai royal family bearing its owner's initials in calligraphy. The most obvious place in the country where calligraphy is present is in graffiti. A few books have been published with calligraphic compositions.\n\n The Vietnamese name for calligraphy is (, literally \"the way of letters or words\"). Vietnamese calligraphy uses a variety of scripts, including Chinese characters, Chữ nôm, and the Latin-based Quốc Ngữ. Historically, calligraphers used the former two scripts. Due to the adoption of the Latin-based Quốc Ngữ, most modern Vietnamese calligraphy uses Roman characters. Traditional Vietnamese calligraphy is strongly affected by that of China for historical and geographic regions. As part of the East Asian cultural sphere, Chinese was often used as the written medium of communication, and as a result, Vietnamese calligraphy thus also follows Chinese calligraphy’s standard and use Han script (Chinese language) in many of its writings. In modern times, calligraphy has been done mainly in the Latin-based Quốc Ngữ script, as Chữ nôm and Chinese characters have largely fallen out of use.\n\nOn the subject of Indian calligraphy, writes:\nAśoka's edicts (c. 265–238 BC) were committed to stone. These inscriptions are stiff and angular in form. Following the Aśoka style of Indic writing, two new calligraphic types appear: Kharoṣṭī and Brāhmī. Kharoṣṭī was used in the northwestern regions of India from the 3rd century BC to the 4th century of the Christian Era, and it was used in Central Asia until the 8th century.\nIn many parts of ancient India, the inscriptions were carried out in smoke-treated palm leaves. This tradition dates back to over two thousand years. Even after the Indian languages were put on paper in the 13th century, palm leaves where considered a preferred medium of writing owing to its longevity (nearly 400 years) compared to paper. Both sides of the leaves were used for writing. Long rectangular strips were gathered on top of one another, holes were drilled through all the leaves, and the book was held together by string. Books of this manufacture were common to Southeast Asia. The palm leaf was an excellent surface for penwriting, making possible the delicate lettering used in many of the scripts of southern Asia.\n\nBurnt clay and copper were a favoured material for Indic inscriptions. In the north of India, birch bark was used as a writing surface as early as the 2nd century AD.\n\nRanjana script is the primary form of Nepalese calligraphy. The script itself, along with its derivatives (like Lantsa, Phagpa, Kutila) are used in Nepal, Tibet, Bhutan, Leh, Mongolia, coastal Japan, and Korea to write \"Om mani padme hum\" and other sacred Buddhist texts, mainly those derived from Sanskrit and Pali.\n\nCalligraphy is central in Tibetan culture. The script is derived from Indic scripts. The nobles of Tibet, such as the High Lamas and inhabitants of the Potala Palace, were usually capable calligraphers. Tibet has been a center of Buddhism for several centuries, and that religion places a great deal of significance on written word. This does not provide for a large body of secular pieces, although they do exist (but are usually related in some way to Tibetan Buddhism). Almost all high religious writing involved calligraphy, including letters sent by the Dalai Lama and other religious and secular authority. Calligraphy is particularly evident on their prayer wheels, although this calligraphy was forged rather than scribed, much like Arab and Roman calligraphy is often found on buildings. Although originally done with a reed, Tibetan calligraphers now use chisel tipped pens and markers as well.\n\nIslamic calligraphy (\"calligraphy\" in Arabic is \"\" ) has evolved alongside Islam and the Arabic language. As it is based on Arabic letters, some call it \"Arabic calligraphy\". However the term \"Islamic calligraphy\" is a more appropriate term as it comprises all works of calligraphy by the Muslim calligraphers from Andalusia in modern Spain to China.\n\nIslamic calligraphy is associated with geometric Islamic art (arabesque) on the walls and ceilings of mosques as well as on the page. Contemporary artists in the Islamic world draw on the heritage of calligraphy to use calligraphic inscriptions or abstractions.\n\nInstead of recalling something related to the spoken word, calligraphy for Muslims is a visible expression of the highest art of all, the art of the spiritual world. Calligraphy has arguably become the most venerated form of Islamic art because it provides a link between the languages of the Muslims with the religion of Islam. The Qur'an has played an important role in the development and evolution of the Arabic language, and by extension, calligraphy in the Arabic alphabet. Proverbs and passages from the Qur'an are still sources for Islamic calligraphy.\n\nIt is generally accepted that Islamic calligraphy excelled during the Ottoman era. Istanbul is an open exhibition hall for all kinds and varieties of calligraphy, from inscriptions in mosques to fountains, schools, houses, etc. \n\nEthiopian (Abyssinian)) calligraphy began with the Ge'ez script, which replaced Epigraphic South Arabian in the Kingdom of Aksum, that was developed specifically for Ethiopian Semitic languages. In those languages that use it, such as Amharic and Tigrinya, the script is called \"\", which means script or alphabet. The Epigraphic South Arabian letters were used for a few inscriptions into the 8th century, though not any South Arabian language since Dʿmt.\n\nEarly inscriptions in Ge'ez and Ge'ez script have been dated to as early as the 5th century BC, and in a sort of proto-Ge'ez written in ESA since the 9th century BC. Ge'ez literature begins with the Christianization of Ethiopia (and the civilization of Axum) in the 4th century, during the reign of Ezana of Axum. \n\nThe Ge'ez script is read from left to right and has been adapted to write other languages, usually ones that are also Semitic. The most widespread use is for Amharic in Ethiopia and Tigrinya in Eritrea and Ethiopia.\n\nThe history of calligraphy in Persia dates back to the pre-Islam era. In Zoroastrianism beautiful and clear writings were always praised.\n\nIt is believed that ancient Persian script was invented by about 600–500 BC to provide monument inscriptions for the Achaemenid kings. These scripts consisted of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal nail-shape letters, which is why it is called \"script of nails/cuneiform script\" (\"\") in Persian. Centuries later, other scripts such as \"Pahlavi\" and \"Avestan\" scripts were used in ancient Persia.\n\nThe Nasta'liq style is the most popular contemporary style among classical Persian calligraphy scripts; Persian calligraphers call it the \"bride of calligraphy scripts\". This calligraphy style has been based on such a strong structure that it has changed very little since. Mir Ali Tabrizi had found the optimum composition of the letters and graphical rules so it has just been fine-tuned during the past seven centuries. It has very strict rules for graphical shape of the letters and for combination of the letters, words, and composition of the whole calligraphy piece.\n\nMayan calligraphy was expressed via Mayan hieroglyphs; modern Mayan calligraphy is mainly used on seals and monuments in the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. Mayan hieroglyphs are rarely used in government offices; however in Campeche, Yucatán and Quintana Roo, Mayan calligraphy is written in Latin letters. Some commercial companies in southern Mexico use Mayan hieroglyphs as symbols of their business. Some community associations and modern Mayan brotherhoods use Mayan hieroglyphs as symbols of their groups.\n\nMost of the archaeological sites in Mexico such as Chichen Itza, Labna, Uxmal, Edzna, Calakmul, etc. have glyphs in their structures. Carved stone monuments known as stele are common sources of ancient Mayan calligraphy.\n\nAfter printing became ubiquitous from the 15th century, the production of illuminated manuscripts began to decline. However, the rise of printing did not mean the end of calligraphy.\n\nThe modern revival of calligraphy began at the end of the 19th century, influenced by the aesthetics and philosophy of William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement. Edward Johnston is regarded as being the father of modern calligraphy. \nAfter studying published copies of manuscripts by architect William Harrison Cowlishaw, he was introduced to William Lethaby in 1898, principal of the Central School of Arts and Crafts, who advised him to study manuscripts at the British Museum.\n\nThis triggered Johnston's interest in the art of calligraphy with the use of a broad edged pen. He began a teaching course in calligraphy at the Central School in Southampton Row, London from September 1899, where he influenced the typeface designer and sculptor Eric Gill. He was commissioned by Frank Pick to design a new typeface for London Underground, still used today (with minor modifications).\n\nHe has been credited for reviving the art of modern penmanship and lettering single-handedly through his books and teachings - his handbook on the subject, \"Writing & Illuminating, & Lettering\" (1906) was particularly influential on a generation of British typographers and calligraphers, including Graily Hewitt, Stanley Morison, Eric Gill, Alfred Fairbank and Anna Simons. Johnston also devised the simply crafted round calligraphic handwriting style, written with a broad pen, known today as the \"Foundational hand\". Johnston initially taught his students an uncial hand using a flat pen angle, but later taught his hand using a slanted pen angle. He first referred to this hand as \"Foundational Hand\" in his 1909 publication, \"Manuscript & Inscription Letters for Schools and Classes and for the Use of Craftsmen\".\n\nGraily Hewitt taught at the Central School of Arts and Crafts and published together with Johnston throughout the early part of the century. Hewitt was central to the revival of gilding in calligraphy, and his prolific output on type design also appeared between 1915 and 1943. He is attributed with the revival of gilding with gesso and gold leaf on vellum. Hewitt helped to found the Society of Scribes & Illuminators (SSI) in 1921, probably the world's foremost calligraphy society.\nHewitt is not without both critics and supporters in his rendering of Cennino Cennini's medieval gesso recipes. Donald Jackson, a British calligrapher, has sourced his gesso recipes from earlier centuries a number of which are not presently in English translation. Graily Hewitt created the patent announcing the award to Prince Philip of the title of Duke of Edinburgh on November 19, 1947, the day before his marriage to Queen Elizabeth.\n\nJohnston’s pupil, Anna Simons, was instrumental in sparking off interest in calligraphy in Germany with her German translation of \"Writing and Illuminating, and Lettering\" in 1910. Austrian Rudolf Larisch, a teacher of lettering at the Vienna School of Art, published six lettering books that greatly influenced German-speaking calligraphers. Because German-speaking countries had not abandoned the Gothic hand in printing, Gothic also had a powerful effect on their styles.\n\nRudolf Koch was a friend and younger contemporary of Larisch. Koch's books, type designs, and teaching made him one of the most influential calligraphers of the 20th century in northern Europe and later in the U.S. Larisch and Koch taught and inspired many European calligraphers, notably Karlgeorg Hoefer, and Hermann Zapf.\n\nContemporary typefaces used by computers, from word processors like Microsoft Word or Apple Pages to professional designers' software like Adobe InDesign, owe a considerable debt to the past and to a small number of professional typeface designers today.\n\nUnicode provides \"Script\" and \"Fraktur\" Latin alphabets that can be used for calligraphy.

{"id": "56253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56253", "title": "Celtic knot", "text": "Celtic knot\n\nCeltic knots, called Icovellavna, (, ) are a variety of knots and stylized graphical representations of knots used for decoration, used extensively in the Celtic style of Insular art. These knots are most known for their adaptation for use in the ornamentation of Christian monuments and manuscripts, such as the 8th-century St. Teilo Gospels, the Book of Kells and the Lindisfarne Gospels. Most are endless knots, and many are varieties of basket weave knots.\n\nThe use of interlace patterns had its origins in the artwork of the late Roman Empire. Knot patterns first appeared in the third and fourth centuries AD and can be seen in Roman floor mosaics of that time. Interesting developments in the artistic use of interlaced knot patterns are found in Byzantine architecture and book illumination, Coptic art, Celtic art, Islamic art, Kievan Rus'ian book illumination, Ethiopian art, and European architecture and book illumination. \n\nSpirals, step patterns, and key patterns are dominant motifs in Celtic art before the Christian influence on the Celts, which began around 450. These designs found their way into early Christian manuscripts and artwork with the addition of depictions from life, such as animals, plants and even humans. In the beginning, the patterns were intricate interwoven cords, called plaits, which can also be found in other areas of Europe, such as Italy, in the 6th century. A fragment of a Gospel Book, now in the Durham Cathedral library and created in northern Britain in the 7th century, contains the earliest example of true knotted designs in the Celtic manner.\n\nExamples of plait work (a woven, unbroken cord design) predate knotwork designs in several cultures around the world, but the broken and reconnected plait work that is characteristic of true knotwork began in northern Italy and southern Gaul and spread to Ireland by the 7th century. The style is most commonly associated with the Celtic lands, but it was also practiced extensively in England and was exported to Europe by Irish and Northumbrian monastic activities on the continent. J. Romilly Allen has identified \"eight elementary knots which form the basis of nearly all the interlaced patterns in Celtic decorative art\". In modern times Celtic art is popularly thought of in terms of national identity and therefore specifically Irish, Scottish or Welsh.\n\nThough tattooing was not a Celtic tradition, Celtic knot tattoos became popular in the United States in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n"}
{"id": "7118644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7118644", "title": "Charles Collette", "text": "Charles Collette\n\nCharles Henry Collette (29 July 1842 – 10 February 1924) was an English stage actor, composer and writer noted for his work in comedy in a long career onstage. He appeared, beginning in the late 1860s, in many Bancroft productions and was engaged by other managers, including J. L. Toole, John Hollingshead, Mary Anderson, Lydia Thompson and Herbert Beerbohm Tree, as well as performing in his own companies. He toured for some years as the title character in F. C. Burnand's \"The Colonel\" and played many military men.\n\nCollette continued acting in London and in the British provinces until 1907, a career of nearly four decades, but he is probably best remembered today for the presence of his musical play \"Cryptoconchoidsyphonostomata\" on the bill with the historic 1875 premiere of Gilbert and Sullivan's \"Trial by Jury\".\n\nCollette was born in London, the son of Charles Hastings Collette, a solicitor, and his wife, Frances Mary, \"née\" Sharpe, and the grandson of General Collette of the Madras Cavalry. As a young man, he held a commission in the Dragoon Guards. He left the army in 1868, and, having enjoyed amateur theatricals while serving in India, he was attracted by a stage career. A mutual friend put him in touch with Marie Bancroft, who cast him as Charles Hampton, a light romantic role, in a comedy, \"Tame Cats\" at the Prince of Wales's Theatre. He made an immediate impression. The magazine \"Fun\" published an article with the title \"Tame Cats; Or, The Triumph of Collette\"; this, however, was not so much a tribute to the actor as a rebuke to his over-enthusiastic friends in the audience.\n\nOver the succeeding years, Collette appeared in many Bancroft productions, including \"School\" by T. W. Robertson, Sheridan's \"The School for Scandal\" (as Sir Oliver Surface), \"The Merchant of Venice\", and Lord Lytton's \"Money\". Another classic role that Collette played was Mr. Puff in \"The Critic\". He was engaged by other managers, notably J. L. Toole, John Hollingshead, Mary Anderson, Lydia Thompson and Herbert Beerbohm Tree, among others, as well as touring his own companies. He appeared in plays by a wide variety of authors besides Shakespeare, Sheridan and Robertson, including stage adaptations of Dickens novels. In 1879, his attempt at theatrical management ended in financial disaster, sending him into bankruptcy for several years and drawing his solicitor father to the brink of professional ruin.\n\nCollette toured for some years as Colonel Woottwweell Woodd in F. C. Burnand's \"The Colonel\". Woodd was one of his favourite roles; others included Sergeant Jones in Robertson's \"Ours\", Colonel Berners in They're Smith's \"Cut off with a Shilling\", Adonis Evergreen in Charles Mathews's \"My Awful Dad\", Autolycus in \"The Winter's Tale\", and Private Saunders in \"Bootles' Baby\", an adaptation by Hugh Moss of a popular novelette by J. S. Winter. He was often referred to as the \"soldier-actor\"; not only did he play a large number of military men, there was, \"The Times\" said, \"no mistaking that he had been in the Army. Tall and upright, with a broad chest and shoulders, he looked even when quite old the perfect type of a healthy Englishman.\"\n\nIn 1887, Collett performed his own comic sketch at the Alhambra Theatre, called \"Charles Collette at Home\". The sketch included several patter songs and a comic lecture upon Natural History. Collette continued acting in London and in the British provinces until 1907, when he played Mr. Micawber in an adaptation of \"David Copperfield\", and in \"In the Bishop's Carriage\" at the Waldorf Theatre. He also appeared in concerts, and, towards the end of his life performed in \"variety\" shows. He also created illustrations later in his life.\n\nIn addition to performing, Collette wrote a number of his own works, including the \"successful romantic extravaganza\" improbably titled \"Cryptoconchoidsyphonostomata, or While It's to be Had\". This play was on the bill at the Royalty Theatre, with Collette in the lead, when Gilbert and Sullivan's \"Trial by Jury\" was premiered in 1875. Collette's song from the piece, \"What an Afternoon!\", became popular. The simple form of the lyric, with its title repeated every other line, caught the public fancy:\n<poem>\n</poem>\nThe popularity of the song prompted unauthorized distribution of the words and music. Collette successfully sued a man named Goode, causing one paper to comment that the song should be retitled \"What a Goode Afternoon\".\n\nOffstage, Collette was an enthusiastic collector of Staffordshire china, and was a long-standing and popular member of the Savage Club. He married Blanche Julia Wilton (1851–1934), the younger sister of Lady Bancroft, with whom he had one daughter.\n\nCollette died at his home near Kew Gardens at the age of 81.\n\n"}

An Earth teenager from the year 1966, she was a companion of the First Doctor and a regular in the programme in its third season, from February to July, 1966. Only three of the serials in which Dodo appeared as a regular are complete in the BBC archive (\"The Ark\", \"The Gunfighters\" and \"The War Machines\"). Dodo's personality was an unsophisticated, bright and happy one.\n\nUltimately the character was not deemed a success by the programme's makers, and Lane's contract was not extended beyond episode two of \"The War Machines.\" To replace her, two new characters, Polly (Anneke Wills) and Ben (Michael Craze), thought to be more in tune with the \"swinging sixties\", became companions. Dodo appeared in six stories (19 episodes, of which 11 currently exist in the BBC Archives).\n\nDespite Jackie Lane's refusal to be involved with the programme, Dodo has appeared in several spin-off productions, including the popular Big Finish audio dramas and novels such as \"Who Killed Kennedy?\" explaining her life after leaving the Doctor.\n\nDodo is introduced at the end of the serial \"The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve\". In that story, the Doctor and Steven travel to 1572 Paris, where they witness the persecution of the city's Huguenot population. Despite befriending a young woman named Anne Chaplet, the Doctor knows he cannot prevent the coming massacre of 10,000 Huguenots, including Anne, by the Catholic French authorities. He therefore leaves in the TARDIS, taking Steven with him. When Steven finds out, he is furious and considers leaving the Doctor while the TARDIS is in 1960s London.\n\nSteven returns at the same time that a young woman wanders into the TARDIS thinking it was a real police box. The Doctor and Steven are taken aback when she introduces herself as Dodo Chaplet and reveals that her grandfather was French. The Doctor speculates that Dodo might be Anne's descendant. (As some have pointed out, this would mean Anne lived to have an illegitimate offspring unless she or a descendant married a man of the same name).\n\nAt the end of \"The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve\" she reveals she has no parents, explaining that she lives with her great aunt \"and she won't care if she never sees me again\". She witnesses images of herself on the Celestial Toymaker's memory window from the day her mother died.\n\nIn her travels with the Doctor, Dodo travels to the far future, unfortunately bringing the common cold with her to infect humanity's descendants; faces the mad games of the Celestial Toymaker; witnesses the gunfight at the O.K. Corral; says good-bye to Steven in \"The Savages\"; and is hypnotised by the rogue artificial intelligence WOTAN in \"The War Machines\".\n\nHalfway through that last adventure, she abruptly departs for a rest in the country after being hypnotised, and never reappears. At the story's conclusion Polly (who, with Ben Jackson, took Dodo's place as a companion) explains to the departing Doctor that Dodo has decided to remain in the 20th Century.\n\nDodo's life prior to joining the Doctor and the circumstances under which she joined him in the TARDIS were elaborated on in the Past Doctor Adventures novel \"Salvation\", where the TARDIS, departing after she has entered it, travels to New York City in Dodo's present, resulting in Dodo working with the Doctor and Steven to investigate mysterious beings who appear to be gods. In the Virgin Missing Adventures novel \"The Man in the Velvet Mask\", Dodo has sex and is infected with an alien virus which slowly corrupts her.\n\nDodo's life after she left the Doctor was not dealt with in the programme. The spin-off novel \"Who Killed Kennedy\" by David Bishop reveals that Dodo suffered a nervous breakdown and was unable to remember her adventures with the Doctor, drifting in and out of psychiatric institutions. Becoming involved with a journalist who was investigating the truth behind UNIT, Dodo is murdered by a pawn of the Master. Her funeral is attended only by her lover and an unidentified man who, based on the limited description provided, may be either the Second or Seventh Doctor. However in the 20th anniversary version of the novel, a new timeline is created where the assassin is stopped by her lover when he travels back in time from the future after an intervention by the Doctor, implied to be the Twelfth such incarnation. However the canonicity of the novels in relation to the television series is open to question.\n\nDodo also appears in the Past Doctor Adventures novel \"Bunker Soldiers\", four short stories in the \"Virgin Decalog\" and \"BBC Short Trips\", and the Big Finish Productions audio dramas \"Mother Russia\", \"Tales from the Vault\", \"Return of the Rocket Men\", and \"The War to End All Wars\" (which reveals that Steven named his favorite daughter after Dodo, although she died in an attempted coup caused by her sisters).\n\nDodo was originally intended to have a \"common\" accent, and is portrayed this way at the end of \"The Massacre\".

It generally takes the form of an edited volume, containing contributions from the honoree's colleagues, former pupils, and friends.\n\nThe term, borrowed from German, and literally meaning \"party-writing\" (cognate with \"feast-script\"), might be translated as \"celebration publication\" or \"celebratory (piece of) writing\". An alternative Latin term is \"liber amicorum\" (literally: “book of friends”). A comparable book presented posthumously is sometimes called a Gedenkschrift (\"memorial publication\"), but this term is much rarer in English.\n\nOriginating in Germany before World War I, this European tradition of honoring special achievements in science and culture was carried to the United States by scientists who escaped the Nazis. In the second half of the 20th century, the practice became used internationally. Since no English term for such a book to mark a special occasion had been in use, the German word \"Festschrift\" has been incorporated into the English language and is frequently used without the italics that designate a foreign term, although the capitalization of the first letter is usually retained from German. Its plural may be either the original \"Festschriften\" or anglicized as \"Festschrifts\". Festschriften are often titled something like \"Essays in Honour of...\" or \"Essays Presented to... .\"\n\nA Festschrift compiled and published by electronic means on the internet is called a Webfestschrift (pronounced either or ), a term coined by the editors of the late Boris Marshak's Webfestschrift, \"Eran ud Aneran\", published online in October 2003. The corresponding \"Webgedenkschrift\" does not appear to be in frequent use .\n\nA Festschrift contains original contributions by the honored academic's close colleagues, often including their former doctoral students. It is typically published on the occasion of the honoree's retirement, significant birthday, or other notable career anniversary. A Festschrift can be anything from a slim volume to a work in several volumes. \"Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt\", for example, began in 1972 as a Festschrift to commemorate the 75th birthday of Joseph Vogt, a German classical historian. Four volumes were planned, but it has since reached 89 volumes (including several which were planned for the next years, but put on hold in 1998). The essays usually relate in some way to, or reflect upon, the honoree's contributions to their scholarly field, but can include important original research by the authors. Many Festschriften also feature a \"tabula gratulatoria\", an extended list of academic colleagues and friends who send their best wishes to the honoree.\n\nIn the case of prominent academics, several Festschriften might be prepared by various groups of students and colleagues, particularly if the scholar made significant contributions to different fields.\n\nIn Germany it is an honor to be designated to prepare such a collection, and being selected by a prominent academic to edit a Festschrift, according to Claudio Naranjo, can symbolize the proverbial passing of the torch.\n\nEndel Tulving, a Canadian neuroscientist, proposed that \"a Festschrift frequently enough also serves as a convenient place in which those who are invited to contribute find a permanent resting place for their otherwise unpublishable or at least difficult-to-publish papers.\"\n\nAs Irving Louis Horowitz summarized, \"\"Festschriften\" persist and multiply. Why? Because they are not just retrospective, but prospective. That is to say the \"Festschrift\" is a \"Beruf\", a call to further work, effort, and energy, a call to the improvement of learning, of a discipline, a science, an artistic vision, or an intellectual position. Even in this age of mass \"Festschriften\", they remain a special literary genre\".\n\nPhilosopher Alan Soble, in a review of a Festschrift in honor of MIT's philosopher Judith Jarvis Thomson proposed 13 conditions that must be satisfied by any adequate Festschrift.\n\n\n"}

The specialist does so by selecting the objects on the page and filling them in with a solid color called a \"flat\", so that the \"flats\" can be used by the colorist by way of the \"magic wand\" tool. In this way, the colorist may select each object during the rendering process-to the exclusion of the other objects on the page-so that the object's base color may be changed, or to render the colors.\n\nBecause each colorist has preferences as to how the flats are to be done flatters usually work as freelancers commissioned directly by the colorist. Pricing for flats vary but as of early 2010 one common going rate for a flatted page was $15 if the page were inked and of regular difficulty ($30 for a double page) with $20 for a sketched page of regular difficulty ($40 for a double sketched page).\n\nNotable flatters include Jeremiah Embs and Neil Fraser that obtained published credit for flats while working for the colorist Brian Buccellato on the comic book series \"Witchblade\" (issues #72, 73, 74) for Top Cow in 2003-2004.

The film stars Julianne Moore, Ellen Page, Steve Carell, Luke Grimes, and Michael Shannon. It is based on the 2007 documentary short film of the same name about police officer Laurel Hester's fight against the Ocean County, New Jersey Board of Chosen Freeholders to allow her pension benefits to be transferred to her domestic partner after being diagnosed with terminal cancer.\n\nThe film is based on the true story of Laurel Hester (Moore), a police officer in Ocean County, New Jersey. The story narrates the difficulties faced by a lesbian police detective and her domestic partner, Stacie Andree (Page). Following her diagnosis with terminal lung cancer in 2005, Hester repeatedly appealed to the county's board of chosen freeholders to have her pension benefits passed on to her domestic partner; she was eventually successful.\n\n\nScreenwriter Ron Nyswaner announced his intention in 2010 to write a feature-length adaptation of Cynthia Wade's 2007 Oscar-winning short film \"Freeheld\", a documentary about New Jersey police officer Laurel Hester's fight against the Ocean County, New Jersey Board of Chosen Freeholders to pass on her pension benefits to her domestic partner, Stacie Andree, after being diagnosed with terminal cancer. At that time, Ellen Page had already agreed to star as Andree; she stated in 2014 that she had been involved in the project's development for almost six years. She first became involved after two of the film's producers, Stacey Sher and Michael Shamberg, sent her a copy of Wade's documentary and asked if she was interested in starring in an adaptation, an offer which she accepted \"right away\". Catherine Hardwicke was attached to the project as director early in its development but later withdrew. Shortly after the film's financing was secured in August 2012, Peter Sollett signed on to replace Hardwicke as director. Julianne Moore was cast as Hester in February 2014. Zach Galifianakis was cast as Steven Goldstein, the founder and then-Chair of Garden State Equality, but was later replaced by Steve Carell. Andree consulted with Page, Sollett and Nyswaner about the making of the film.\n\nAlthough the film is set in New Jersey, it was filmed in New York due to its more generous tax incentives for filmmakers. Filming began in October 2014 in Queens. In late October, a scene that was supposed to be filmed at Salesian High School, a Catholic boys' school in New Rochelle, New York, had to be relocated after the school's principal reversed his decision to allow the crew to film on the school campus. The shoot was later relocated to the city hall of Rye, New York, which stood in for the Ocean County Administration Building in a scene where Hester and Andree apply for domestic partnership. Another scene, in which Hester lies ill in a hospital room, was filmed in the community center of Greenburgh, New York, while the town board room of North Hempstead, New York stood in for the Ocean County Board of Freeholders' chambers.\n\nThe soundtrack have been composed by Hans Zimmer & Johnny Marr. It is now released at WaterTower Music & iTunes and includes the following tracks.\n\nIn February 2015, Lionsgate acquired distribution rights to the film. It received a limited release on October 2, 2015.\n\n\"Freeheld\" received mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports a 48% rating based on 122 reviews, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The consensus states: \"\"Freeheld\" certainly means well, but its cardboard characters and by-the-numbers drama undermine its noble intentions.\" On Metacritic, the film has a 50 out of 100 rating based on 29 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nThe film was listed by Autostraddle in 15th place of the best 102 lesbian films ever.\n\n"}

It was just a joke. My husband, like myself, always kept friendly memories of Nietzsche [...] his behavior precisely towards women was so sensitive, so natural and comradely, that even today in old age I cannot regard Nietzsche as a despiser of women.\n\nNietzsche wrote specifically about his views on women in Section VII of \"Human, All Too Human\", which seems to hold women in high regard; but given some of his other comments, his overall attitude towards women is ambivalent. For instance, while in \"Human, All Too Human\", he states that \"the perfect woman is a higher type of human than the perfect man, and also something much more rare,\" there are a number of contradictions and subtleties in Nietzsche's thought elsewhere which are not easily reconcilable. He could be both in praise and contempt of women at one time or another. For instance, in the following passage: \"What inspires respect for woman, and often enough even fear, is her nature, which is more “natural” than man’s, the genuine, cunning suppleness of a beast of prey, the tiger’s claw under the glove, the naiveté of her egoism, her uneducability and inner wildness, the incomprehensibility, scope, and movement of her desires and virtues.\" (\"Beyond Good and Evil\", section 239.)\n\nHis attitude can sometimes be entirely disparaging: \"From the beginning, nothing has been more alien, repugnant, and hostile to woman than truth—her great art is the lie, her highest concern is mere appearance and beauty.\" In section 6 in \"Why I Write Such Excellent Books\" of \"Ecce Homo\", he claims that \"goodness\" in women is a sign of \"physiological degeneration\", and that women are on the whole cleverer and more wicked than men- which in Nietzsche's view, constitutes a compliment. Yet he goes on to claim that the emancipation of women, and feminists, was merely the resentment of some women against other women, who were physically better constituted and able to bear children.\n\nDespite Nietzsche's writings being viewed as being misogynistic by many, others, such as Anthony Ludovici, insist that he is only an anti-feminist, not a misogynist. Other writings include:\n\n\"Woman's love involves injustice and blindness against everything that she does not love... Woman is not yet capable of friendship: women are still cats and birds. Or at best cows... (\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\", On the Friend)\n\n\"Woman! One-half of mankind is weak, typically sick, changeable, inconstant... she needs a religion of weakness that glorifies being weak, loving, and being humble as divine: or better, she makes the strong weak--she rules when she succeeds in overcoming the strong... Woman has always conspired with the types of decadence, the priests, against the 'powerful', the 'strong', the men-\" (The Will to Power - 864, Second German edition of 1906) (It must be noted, however, that \"The Will to Power\" is a gathering of notes and fragments assembled through his sister Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche and others which were never approved by Nietzsche himself to be published.)\n\nScholars of Aristotle have drawn comparisons between Nietzsche's views on women and Aristotle's views on women. They have argued that Nietzsche may have borrowed much of his political philosophy from the latter.\n\nSome philosophers have even suggested that Nietzsche's philosophy cannot be understood or analyzed apart from his remarks on women. They discuss the fact that Nietzsche's work has been useful in the development of some feminist theory but ultimately conclude \"While Nietzsche challenges traditional hierarchies between mind and body, reason and irrationality, nature and culture, truth and fiction - hierarchies that have been used to degrade and exclude women - his remarks about women and his use of feminine and maternal metaphors throughout his writings confound attempts simply to proclaim Nietzsche a champion of feminism or women.\"\n\nLou Andreas-Salomé, who knew Nietzsche very well, and claimed that he had proposed to her (according to her, she refused him) claimed there was something feminine in Nietzsche's \"spiritual nature\", and that he had considered genius to be a feminine genius.\n\nFrances Nesbitt Oppel interprets Nietzsche's attitude towards women as part of a rhetorical strategy...Nietzsche's apparent misogyny is part of his overall strategy to demonstrate that our attitudes toward sex-gender are thoroughly cultural, are often destructive of our own potential as individuals and as a species, and may be changed. What looks like misogyny may be understood as part of a larger strategy whereby \"woman-as-such\" (the universal essence of woman with timeless character traits) is shown to be a product of male desire, a construct.\n\nOthers exhibit a less tolerant sophistication, though some recognize that Nietzsche made these remarks from a consciously relative position, and while they show little patience for his remarks overall they recognize that however odious his individual opinion of women may have been, he was not advocating it as a model for others. Cornelia Klinger states in her book \"Continental Philosophy in Feminist Perspective\": \"Nietzsche, like Schopenhauer a prominent hater of women, at least relativizes his savage statements about woman-as-such.\" One of Nietzsche's own statements is cited in support of this assertion:\"Whenever a cardinal problem is at stake, there speaks an unchangeable \"this is I\"; about man and woman, for example, a thinker cannot relearn but only finish learning–only discover ultimately how this is \"settled in him.\" At times we find certain solutions of problems that inspire strong faith in \"us\"; some call them henceforth \"their\" \"convictions.\" Later–we see them only as steps to self-knowledge, signposts to the problem we \"are\"–rather, to the great stupidity we are, to our spiritual \"fatum\", to what is \"unteachable\" very \"deep down\". After this abundant civility that I have just evidenced in relation to myself I shall perhaps be permitted more readily to state a few truths about \"woman as such\"–assuming that it is now known from the outset how very much these are after all only–\"my\" truths.\" (BGE, 7, 231)\n\nAnother author takes up this same quote, recognizing that \"[a]lthough Nietzsche as generously as ever saves his commentators the labor of interpretation the problem recurs precisely because of the nature of what he proceeds to call his truths.\" But instead of focusing on putative misogyny she opines:Much more [...] must be thought to affect everything Nietzsche writes about woman. Rather than mere psychological digs and constructions, rather than a simple expression of his own misogyny, Nietzsche's philosophic expression of the nature of woman reflects and repeats the possibilities of the affirmation or denial of illusion. This is Nietzsche's understanding of truth, and to this extent Nietzsche was able to exploit his own misogyny, in style, tracing the Platonic metaphor as such.\n\nAs Leonard Lawlor and Zeynep Direk point out, \"What Nietzsche \"says\" -and repeats with hysterical insistence- is that woman is the source of all folly and unreason, the siren figure who lures the male philosopher out of his appointed truth-seeking path.\"\n"}

Unless made of a highly durable material (e.g. china), they would often be enclosed in a glass container (known as globes) to protect them from the weather. In some cases, they were embedded into the grave itself (e.g. on the concrete over the grave) while others were merely placed on or by the grave.\nIn \"Life on the Mississippi\", Mark Twain comments on burial practices in New Orleans: \"They bury their dead in vaults, above the ground. ... Fresh flowers, in vases of water, are to be seen at the portals of many of the vaults: placed there by the pious hands of bereaved parents and children, husbands and wives, and renewed daily. A milder form of sorrow finds its inexpensive and lasting remembrancer in the coarse and ugly but indestructible 'immortelle'—which is a wreath or cross or some such emblem, made of rosettes of black linen, with sometimes a yellow rosette at the conjunction of the cross's bars—kind of sorrowful breast-pin, so to say.

Being more expensive than fresh flowers, immortelles were normally left on graves by close family.

Grey's \"A Gunman Has Escaped\" (1948). There are copies of both films in the BFI National Archive, but the copy of \"A Gunman Has Escaped\" is incomplete.\n\nIn the 1950s she married the director Philip Saville, and after a short spell in New York where she began writing, the couple settled in Hampstead and had two sons. Arden then wrote several plays and television scripts, some of which her husband directed.\n\nHer stage play \"Conscience and Desire, and Dear Liz\" (1954) attracted interest, and her comedy television drama \"Curtains For Harry\" (1955), starring Bobby Howes and Sydney Tafler, was transmitted on 20 October 1955 by the newly established ITV network. The latter featured the \"Carry On\" actress Joan Sims. Arden's co-writer on this piece was the American Richard Lester, who was then working as a television director.\n\nArden worked with some leading figures of British theatre and cinema in the late 1950s.\n\nIn 1958, her play \"The Party\", an intense family drama set in Kilburn, was directed at London's New Theatre by Charles Laughton. It turned out to be Laughton's last appearance on the London stage, while it provided Albert Finney with his first theatre role.\n\nHer television drama \"The Thug\" (1959) provided a powerful early role for actor Alan Bates.\n\nIn 1964, Arden appeared with Harold Pinter in a television production of Jean-Paul Sartre's \"Huis Clos\", directed by Saville.\n\nArden's work became increasingly radical following her growing interest and involvement in feminism and the anti-psychiatry movement of the 1960s. This is particularly evident from 1965 onwards, starting with the television drama \"The Logic Game\", which she wrote and starred in. \"The Logic Game\", which was directed by Saville, also starred the British actor David de Keyser who worked alongside Arden again in the film \"Separation\" (1967). Arden, again, wrote the screenplay and the film was directed by her creative partner Jack Bond (born 1937). \"Separation\", which was photographed in atmospheric black and white by Aubrey Dewar, also featured music by the chart-topping British group Procol Harum.\n\nArden and Bond had previously worked on the documentary film \"Dalí in New York\" (1966), which mainly consists of the surrealist artist Salvador Dalí and Arden walking the streets of New York City discussing Dalí's work. This film was resurrected and shown at the 2007 Tate Gallery Dalí exhibition.\n\nArden's television work in the mid-1960s included appearances in Saville's \"Exit 19\", Jack's Russell's \"The Interior Decorator\", and the satirical programme \"That Was the Week That Was\", hosted by David Frost.\n\nArden's work in experimental theatre in the late 1960s and the 1970s coincided with her return to cinema as an actor, writer and director (or co-director).\n\nThe play \"Vagina Rex and the Gas Oven\" (1969), starring Victor Spinetti, and Sheila Allen, played to packed houses for six weeks at London's Arts Lab. It was described by Arthur Marwick, in his book \"The Sixties\" as \"perhaps the most important single production\" at the venue during that period. Also around this time Arden wrote the drama \"The Illusionist\".\n\nIn 1970, Arden formed the radical feminist theatre group Holocaust and then wrote the play \"A New Communion for Freaks, Prophets and Witches\". The play would later be adapted for the screen as \"The Other Side of the Underneath\" (1972). Arden directed the film and appeared in it uncredited; screenings at film festivals, including the 1972 London Film Festival, caused a considerable stir. The film depicts a woman's mental breakdown and rebirth in scenes at times violent and highly shocking; the writer and critic George Melly described it as \"a most illuminating season in Hell\", while the BBC Radio journalist David Will declared the film to be \"a major breakthrough for the British cinema\".\n\nThroughout her life Arden's interest in other cultures and belief systems increasingly took the form of a personal spiritual quest.\n\nFollowing \"The Other Side of the Underneath\", there were two further collaborations with Jack Bond in the 1970s: \"Vibration\" (1974), described by Geoff Brown and Robert Murphy in their book \"Film Directors in Britain and Ireland\" (British Film Institute 2006) as \"an exercise in meditation utilising experimental film and video techniques\", and the futuristic \"Anti-Clock\" (1979), which featured Arden's songs on the soundtrack and starred Sebastian Saville. The latter opened the 1979 London Film Festival.\n\nIn 1978, Arden published the book \"You Don't Know What You Want, Do You?\", and supported its publication with public readings and discussions, such as that at The King's Head Theatre in London on 1 October 1978. Although loosely defined as poetry the book is also a radical social and psychological manifesto which has been compared with R.D. Laing's \"Knots\". By this time, Arden had moved on from feminism to a view that all people needed to be set free from the tyranny of rationality.\n\nShe had two sons with Philip Saville: Sebastian and Dominic. Sebastian runs Release the British centre of expertise on drugs, the law and human rights. Dominic is the chief executive officer of 3DD Entertainment, a British film distribution and production company.\n\nArden took her own life at Hindlethwaite Hall in Coverdale, Yorkshire on 20 December 1982. She was initially buried in Darlington West Cemetery, but on 14 February 2011, her remains were exhumed and moved by her family to Highgate Cemetery in London.\n\nIn July 2008, Arden was one of the topics discussed in the Conference of 1970s British Culture and Society held at the University of Portsmouth.\n\nIn 2009, the British Film Institute restored the three major feature films Arden made with her creative associate Jack Bond: \"Separation\" (1967), \"The Other Side of the Underneath\" (1972) and \"Anti-Clock\" (1979). The films became available on DVD and Blu-ray in July 2009. Bond was involved in the restoration and reissue processes, and the release of the films was accompanied by exhibition of the restored features at the National Film Theatre and The Cube Microplex in Bristol. Her books poetry and plays remain out of print.\n\nAs a tribute to Arden, the experimental-music group Hwyl Nofio, fronted by Steve Parry from Pontypool, included the song \"Anti-Clock\" on their album \"Dark\" (2012).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "178959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=178959", "title": "Kruithof curve", "text": "Kruithof curve\n\nThe Kruithof curve describes a region of illuminance levels and color temperatures that are often viewed as comfortable or pleasing to an observer. The curve was constructed from psychophysical data collected by Dutch physicist Arie Andries Kruithof, though the original experimental data is not present on the curve itself. Lighting conditions within the bounded region were empirically assessed as being pleasing or natural, whereas conditions outside the region were considered uncomfortable, displeasing or unnatural. sources that are considered natural or closely resemble Planckian black bodies, but its value in describing human preference has been consistently questioned by further studies on interior lighting.\n\nFor example, natural daylight has a color temperature of 6500 K and an illuminance of about 10 to 10 lux. This color temperature–illuminance pair results in natural color rendition, but if viewed at a low illuminance, would appear bluish. At typical indoor office illuminance levels of about 400 lux, pleasing color temperatures are lower (between 3000 and 6000 K), and at typical home illuminance levels of about 75 lux, pleasing color temperatures are even lower (between 2400 and 2700 K). These color temperature-illuminance pairs are often achieved with fluorescent and incandescent sources, respectively. It is noteworthy that the pleasing region of the curve contains color temperatures and illuminance levels comparable to naturally lit environments.\n\nAt the emergence of fluorescent lighting in 1941, Kruithof conducted psychophysical experiments to provide a technical guide to design artificial lighting. Using gas-discharge fluorescent lamps, Kruithof was able to manipulate the color of emitted light and ask observers to report as to whether or not the source was pleasing to them. The sketch of his curve as presented consists of three major regions: the middle region, which corresponds to light sources considered pleasing; the lower region, which corresponds to colors that are considered cold and dim; and the upper region, which corresponds to colors that are warm and unnaturally colorful. These regions, while approximate, are still used to determine appropriate lighting configurations for homes or offices.\n\nKruithof's findings are directly related to human adaptation to changes in illumination. As illuminance decreases, human sensitivity to blue light increases. This is known as the Purkinje effect. The human visual system switches from photopic (cone-dominated) vision to scotopic (rod-dominated) vision when luminance levels decrease. Rods have a very high spectral sensitivity to blue energy, whereas cones have varying spectral sensitivities to reds, greens and blues. Since the dominating photoreceptor in scotopic vision is most sensitive to blue, human sensitivity to blue light is therefore increased. Because of this, intense sources of higher (bluer) color temperatures are all generally considered to be displeasing at low luminance levels, and a narrow range of pleasing sources exist. Subsequently, the range of pleasing sources increases in photopic vision as luminance levels are increased.\n\nWhile the curve has been used as a guide to design artificial lighting for indoor spaces, with the general suggestion to use sources with low correlated color temperatures at low illuminances, Kruithof did not describe the method of evaluation, the independent variables, nor the test sample that were used to develop the curve. Without these data, nor other validation, the conclusions should not be considered credible. The relationship between illuminance and CCT was not supported by subsequent work.\n\nIlluminance and CCT has been examined in many studies of interior lighting and these studies consistently demonstrate a different relationship to that suggested by Kruithof. Rather than having upper and lower boundaries, these studies do not suggest CCT to have significant effect and for illuminance suggest only to avoid levels below 300 lux.\n\nThe Kruithof curve, as presented, does not contain experimental data points and serves as an approximation for desirable lighting conditions. Therefore, its scientific accuracy has been reassessed.\n\nColor rendering index is a metric for describing the appearance of a source and whether or not it is considered pleasing. The color rendering index of a given source is a measure of that source's ability to faithfully reproduce colors of an object. Light sources, like candles or incandescent light bulbs produce spectrums of electromagnetic energy that closely resemble Plankian black bodies; they look much like natural sources. Many fluorescent lamps or LED light bulbs have spectrums that do not match those of Plankian blackbodies and are considered unnatural. Therefore, the way that they render the perceived colors of an environment may be also considered unnatural. While these newer sources can still achieve correlated color temperatures and illuminance levels that are within the comfortable region of the Kruithof curve, variability in their color rendering indices may cause these sources to ultimately be displeasing.\n\nDifferent activities or scenarios call for different color temperature-illuminance pairs: preferred light sources change depending on the scenario the source is illuminating. Individuals did prefer color temperature-illuminance pairs within the comfortable region for dining, socializing and studying, but also preferred color temperature-illuminance pairs that were in the lower uncomfortable region for night time activities and preparing for bed. This is linked to the Purkinje effect; individuals who desire some light at night time desire lower (redder) color temperatures even if luminance levels are very low.\n\nKruithof's findings may also vary as a function of culture or geographic location. Desirable sources are based on an individual's previous experiences of perceiving color, and as different regions of the world may have their own lighting standards, each culture would likely have its own acceptable light sources.\n\nThe illuminance of a source is the dominating factor for deciding as to whether or not a source is pleasing or comfortable, as viewers participating in this experiment evaluated a range of correlated color temperatures and illuminance levels, yet their impressions remained generally unchanged as correlated color temperature changed. Additionally, there is a relationship between correlated color temperature and appeared brightness of a source. From these findings, it is evident that color rendering index, in place of correlated color temperature, may be a more appropriate metric for determining as to whether or not a certain source is considered pleasing.\n\n\n\n"}

When All-World was created, Gan appeared in metaphysical form as a giant edifice known as the Dark Tower, alongside six Beams, which are protected by twelve Guardians.\n\nIt is said that one of the Guardians, Maturin the Turtle, vomited out a universe as the result of a stomach ache. This universe includes the Keystone Earth, which is a reflection of the \"real world\" and also includes a fictional version of Stephen King himself. It is the universe of the Rose too.\n\nSome people have the ability to travel between universes by \"going Todash\"; other ways are through rare artifacts like the Wizard's Rainbow, the Talisman, and the Lil Pink.\n\nGan uses Stephen King as a facilitator to tell the tale of the Gunslinger, so Roland Deschain could successfully go about his task of reaching the Tower. If the author died before completing his task, Roland would not have \"known\" how to further proceed on his quest to the Tower and, without any significant remaining opposition, the Crimson King would have finally toppled the Dark Tower and initiated \"Discordia\"—the event which all universes would have ceased to exist—and there would be no story created.\n\n\"Ka\" is a plot element in Stephen King's \"Dark Tower\" series. It is a word of the fictional language High Speech.\n\nIn the books, it is a mysterious force that leads all living (and unliving) creatures. It is the will of Gan, the approximate equivalent of destiny or fate, in King's fictional language of High Speech. \"Ka\" can be considered to be a guide, a destination, but is certainly not a plan—at least, not one that is known to mortals. Ka is not necessarily a force of good or evil; it manipulates both sides, and seems to have no definite morality of its own. To this end, Ka resonates with the concept of karma.\n\nBecause of the importance of \"ka\" to the world of King's \"Dark Tower\", many phrases in the High Speech use the word ka, such as:\n\n\nA \"ka-tet\" is a group of beings brought together by \"ka\". \"We are \"ka-tet\". We are one from many,\" says Roland Deschain on the day before the Battle of Algul Siento. \"Ka-tet\" is the belief that a group of people can be tied together by fate, or \"ka\". It is said that a group has shared \"khef\" or the water of life. Sometimes the symbol of water is used literally, as in a ritual Roland and his \"ka-tet\" performs the night before the battle of Algul Siento. In the seventh novel, Susannah Dean, who ends up understanding ka maybe more than Roland himself, comes to the understanding that in simple terms, \"ka-tet\" means family.\n\nRoland's \"ka-tet\" includes himself, Eddie Dean, Susannah Dean, Oy, and Jake Chambers. Roland's previous \"ka-tet\" included himself, Cuthbert Allgood, Jamie De Curry, and Alain Johns.\n\n\"Ka\" is mentioned in some of King's other books, including \"Hearts in Atlantis\", \"Desperation\" and \"Insomnia\". The characters James Eric Gardener in \"The Tommyknockers\" and Rosie McClendon in \"Rose Madder\" also ponder about \"ka\". It is mentioned in \"The Stand\" by Judge Farris when he observes a crow outside his window that he believes is Randall Flagg shortly before he is killed by Flagg's men. However, in this context it appears that \"ka\" refers to the Egyptian word for life force.\n\nThe \"ka-tet\" concept has been frequently used by King, even in books that do not use the terms \"ka\" or \"ka-tet\", such as \"It\", \"The Stand\", \"Desperation\", \"Insomnia\", \"Dreamcatcher\", and \"Duma Key\". This may be compared to Kurt Vonnegut's \"karass\".\n\nThe Random and the Purpose are concepts elaborating the \"grammar\" of All-World introduced in \"Insomnia\". The Purpose and the Random are driving forces on the different levels (worlds or realities) the Dark Tower connects. There are even stronger forms like the Higher Purpose and the Higher Random. It is not totally clear whether these higher forms are multiple individual beings sharing a common aim, or if they are underlying forces not bound to personal forms. Both Purpose and Random have so-called agents, middlemen between ordinary human beings (\"Short-Timers\") and the god-like All-Timers. Clotho and Lachesis are agents of the Purpose, while Atropos is an agent of the Random. Central is the idea that Purpose and Random need to be in balance.\n\nFor each field exist higher beings which seem to be god-like. While arguably Gan or Maturin would belong to the Higher Purpose , the Crimson King or It are beings of the Higher Random .\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20458", "title": "Musicology", "text": "Musicology\n\nMusicology () is the scholarly analysis and research-based study of music. Musicology is part of the humanities. A scholar who participates in musical research is a musicologist.\n\nTraditionally, historical musicology (commonly termed \"music history\") has been the most prominent sub-discipline of musicology. In the 2010s, historical musicology is one of several large musicology sub-disciplines. Historical musicology, ethnomusicology, and systematic musicology are approximately equal in size. Ethnomusicology is the study of music in its cultural context. Systematic musicology includes music acoustics, the science and technology of acoustical musical instruments, and the musical implications of physiology, psychology, sociology, philosophy and computing. Cognitive musicology is the set of phenomena surrounding the computational modeling of music. In some countries, music education is a prominent sub-field of musicology, while in others it is regarded as a distinct academic field, or one more closely affiliated with teacher education, educational research, and related fields. Like music education, music therapy is a specialized form of applied musicology which is sometimes considered more closely affiliated with health fields, and other times regarded as part of musicology proper.\n\nThe parent disciplines of musicology include:\n\nMusicology also has two central, practically oriented sub-disciplines with no parent discipline: performance practice and research (sometimes viewed as a form of artistic research), and the theory, analysis and composition of music. The disciplinary neighbors of musicology address other forms of art, performance, ritual and communication, including the history and theory of the visual and plastic arts and of architecture; linguistics, literature and theater; religion and theology; and sport. Musical knowledge is applied in medicine, education, and music therapy—which, effectively, are parent disciplines of applied musicology.\n\nMusic history or historical musicology is concerned with the composition, performance, reception, and criticism of music over time. Historical studies of music are for example concerned with a composer's life and works, the developments of styles and genres, \"e.g.\", baroque concertos, the social function of music for a particular group of people, \"e.g.\", court music, or modes of performance at a particular place and time, \"e.g.\", Johann Sebastian Bach's choir in Leipzig. Like the comparable field of art history, different branches and schools of historical musicology emphasize different types of musical works and approaches to music. There are also national differences in various definitions of historical musicology. In theory, \"music history\" could refer to the study of the history of any type or genre of music, \"e.g.\", the history of Indian music or the history of rock. In practice, these research topics are more often considered within ethnomusicology (see below) and \"historical musicology\" is typically assumed to imply Western Art music of the European tradition.\n\nThe methods of historical musicology include source studies (especially manuscript studies), paleography, philology (especially textual criticism), style criticism, historiography (the choice of historical method), musical analysis (analysis of music to find \"inner coherence\"), and iconography. The application of musical analysis to further these goals is often a part of music history, though pure analysis or the development of new tools of music analysis is more likely to be seen in the field of music theory. Music historians create a number of written products, ranging from journal articles describing their current research, new editions of musical works, biographies of composers and other musicians, book-length studies or university textbook chapters or entire textbooks. Music historians may examine issues in a close focus, as in the case of scholars who examine the relationship between words and music for a given composer's art songs. On the other hand, some scholars take a broader view, and assess the place of a given type of music, such as the symphony in society using techniques drawn from other fields, such as economics, sociology, or philosophy.\n\n\"New musicology\" is a term applied since the late 1980s to a wide body of work emphasizing cultural study, analysis, and criticism of music. Such work may be based on feminist, gender studies, queer theory, or postcolonial theory, or the work of Theodor W. Adorno. Although New Musicology emerged from within historical musicology, the emphasis on cultural study within the Western art music tradition places New Musicology at the junction between historical, ethnological and sociological research in music.\n\nNew musicology was a reaction against traditional historical musicology, which according to Susan McClary, \"fastidiously declares issues of musical signification off-limits to those engaged in legitimate scholarship.\" Charles Rosen, however, retorts that McClary, \"sets up, like so many of the 'new musicologists', a straw man to knock down, the dogma that music has no meaning, and no political or social significance.\" Today, many musicologists no longer distinguish between musicology and new musicology, since many of the scholarly concerns once associated with new musicology have now become mainstream, and they feel the term \"new\" no longer applies.\n\nEthnomusicology, formerly comparative musicology, is the study of music in its cultural context. It is often considered the anthropology or ethnography of music. Jeff Todd Titon has called it the study of \"people making music\". Although it is most often concerned with the study of non-Western musics, it also includes the study of Western music from an anthropological or sociological perspective, cultural studies and sociology as well as other disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. Some ethnomusicologists primarily conduct historical studies, but the majority are involved in long-term participant observation, or combine ethnographic and historical approaches in their fieldwork. Therefore, ethnomusiological scholarship can be characterized as featuring a substantial, intensive fieldwork component, often involving long-term residence within the community studied.\nClosely related to ethnomusiology is the emerging branch of sociomusicology. For instance, Ko (2011) proposed the hypothesis of \"Biliterate and Trimusical\" in Hong Kong sociomusicology.\n\nPopular music studies, known, \"misleadingly,\" as \"popular musicology\", emerged in the 1980s as an increasing number of musicologists, ethnomusicologists, and other varieties of historians of American and European culture began to write about popular musics past and present. The first journal focusing on popular music studies was Popular Music, which began publication in 1981. The same year an academic society solely devoted to the topic was formed, the International Association for the Study of Popular Music. The Association's founding was partly motivated by the interdisciplinary agenda of popular musicology though the group has been characterized by a polarized 'musicological' and 'sociological' approach also typical of popular musicology.\n\nMusic theory is a field of study that describes the elements of music and includes the development and application of methods for composing and for analyzing music through both notation and, on occasion, musical sound itself. Broadly, theory may include any statement, belief, or conception of or about music (Boretz, 1995). A person who studies or practices music theory is a music theorist.\n\nSome music theorists attempt to explain the techniques composers use by establishing rules and patterns. Others model the experience of listening to or performing music. Though extremely diverse in their interests and commitments, many Western music theorists are united in their belief that the acts of composing, performing, and listening to music may be explicated to a high degree of detail (this, as opposed to a conception of musical expression as fundamentally ineffable except in musical sounds). Generally, works of music theory are both descriptive and prescriptive, attempting both to define practice and to influence later practice. Thus, music theory generally lags behind practice but also points towards future exploration, composition, and performance.\n\nMusicians study music theory to understand the structural relationships in the (nearly always notated) music. Composers study music theory to understand how to produce effects and structure their own works. Composers may study music theory to guide their precompositional and compositional decisions. Broadly speaking, music theory in the Western tradition focuses on harmony and counterpoint, and then uses these to explain large scale structure and the creation of melody.\n\nMusic psychology applies the content and methods of all subdisciplines of psychology (perception, cognition, motivation, etc.) to understand how music is created, perceived, responded to, and incorporated into individuals' and societies' daily lives. Its primary branches include cognitive musicology, which emphasizes the use of computational models for human musical abilities and cognition, and the cognitive neuroscience of music, which studies the way that music perception and production manifests in the brain using the methodologies of cognitive neuroscience. While aspects of the field can be highly theoretical, much of modern music psychology seeks to optimize the practices and professions of music performance, composition, education, and therapy.\n\nPerformance practice draws on many of the tools of historical musicology to answer the specific question of how music was performed in various places at various times in the past. Although previously confined to early music, recent research in performance practice has embraced questions such as how the early history of recording affected the use of vibrato in classical music, or instruments in Klezmer.\n\nWithin the rubric of musicology, performance practice tends to emphasize the collection and synthesis of evidence about how music should be performed. The important other side, learning how to sing authentically or perform a historical instrument is usually part of conservatory or other performance training. However, many top researchers in performance practice are also excellent musicians.\n\nMusic performance research (or music performance science) is strongly associated with music psychology. It aims to document and explain the psychological, physiological, sociological and cultural details of how music is actually performed (rather than how it should be performed). The approach to research tends to be systematic and empirical, and to involve the collection and analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data. The findings of music performance research can often be applied in music education.\n\nMusicologists in tenure track professor positions typically hold a Ph.D in musicology. In the 1960s and 1970s, some musicologists obtained professor positions with an M.A. as their highest degree, but in the 2010s, the Ph.D is the standard minimum credential for tenure track professor positions. As part of their initial training, musicologists typically complete a B.Mus or a B.A. in music (or a related field such as history) and in many cases an M.A. in musicology. Some individuals apply directly from a bachelor's degree to a Ph.D, and in these cases, they may not receive an M.A. In the 2010s, given the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of university graduate programs, some applicants for musicology Ph.D programs may have academic training both in music and outside of music (e.g., a student may apply with a B.Mus and an M.A. in psychology). In music education, individuals may hold an M.Ed and an Ed.D.\n\nMost musicologists work as instructors, lecturers or professors in colleges, universities or conservatories. The job market for tenure track professor positions is very competitive. Entry-level applicants must hold a completed Ph.D or the equivalent degree and applicants to more senior professor positions must have a strong record of publishing in peer-reviewed journals. Some Ph.D-holding musicologists are only able to find insecure positions as sessional lecturers. The job tasks of a musicologist are the same as those of a professor in any other humanities discipline: she teaches undergraduate and/or graduate classes in her area of specialization and, in many cases some general courses (such as Music Appreciation or Introduction to Music History), conducts research in her area of expertise, publishes articles about her research in peer-reviewed journals, authors book chapters, books or textbooks, travels to conferences to give talks on her research and learn about research in her field, and, if her program includes a graduate school, supervises M.A. and Ph.D students and gives them guidance on the preparation of their theses and dissertations. Some musicology professors may take on senior administrative positions in their institution, such as Dean or Chair of the School of Music.\n\nThe vast majority of major musicologists and music historians from past generations have been men, as in the 19th century and early 20th century; women's involvement in teaching music was mainly in elementary and secondary music teaching. Nevertheless, some women musicologists have reached the top ranks of the profession. Carolyn Abbate (born 1956) is an American musicologist who did her PhD at Princeton University. She has been described by the \"Harvard Gazette\" as \"one of the world's most accomplished and admired music historians\". \n\nSusan McClary (born 1946) is a musicologist associated with the \"New Musicology\" who incorporates feminist music criticism in her work. McClary holds a PhD from Harvard University. One of her best known works is \"Feminine Endings\" (1991), which covers musical constructions of gender and sexuality, gendered aspects of traditional music theory, gendered sexuality in musical narrative, music as a gendered discourse and issues affecting women musicians. In the book, McClary suggests that the sonata form (used in symphonies and string quartets) may be a sexist or misogynistic procedure that constructs gender and sexual identity. McClary's \"Conventional Wisdom\" (2000) argues that the traditional musicological assumption of the existence of \"purely musical\" elements, divorced from culture and meaning, the social and the body, is a conceit used to veil the social and political imperatives of the worldview that produces the classical canon most prized by supposedly objective musicologists.\n\nOther notable women scholars include:\n\n\n\nAlthough many musicology journals are not available on-line, or are only available through pay-for-access portals, a sampling of peer reviewed journals in various subfields gives some idea of musicological writings:\n\nThe following musicology journals can be accessed on-line through JSTOR (requires subscription for full access). Many of them have their latest issues available on-line via publisher portals (usually requiring a fee for access).\n\n"}

In 1986, at the age of 25, she published her first book: an essay about a Catalan realist poet from the 1960s, Gabriel Ferrater, written in collaboration with Xavier Macià, under the title \"The poetry of Gabriel Ferrater\". This work won the Catalan Essay Prize Josep Vallverdú. In 1989, Perpinyà received the Extraordinary Prize for her PhD thesis from the University of Barcelona for research on Ferrater. She became one of his main specialists. In 1998, she published her first novel, \"A Good Mistake\", where was already shown \"the complexity and the elaboration that will characterize the rest of her novels”. In A \"House to Compose\" (2001), Perpinyà developed a new genre half way between a story and a novel. \"Mistana\" (2005), much more fantastic, was awarded a National Critics Prize. In \"The Privileged\" (2007), she opted, once more, for a renovation of literary genres with a dramatic novel. In the year 2010, she launched her first theatre play, \"The Calligraphers\". After her Alpinist novel \"To the vertigo\" (2013), Perpinya publishes \"And, suddenly, Paradise\" (2018), an experimental novel on the addiction to Internet. \n\nThe work of Núria Perpinyà is a mixture of intellectual reflections and irony. Her style has been labelled as “a magmatic writing style”, and it has been characterized by “a control of the composition, a linguistic precision and originality of the actions”. In each of her books, Perpinyà has challenged herself with different experiments: \"A Good Mistake\" is a thriller based on readers’ false suppositions. In \"A House to compose\", she explored a new literary genre: a “fragmented novel” which, even though belonging to a Composite Novel or Short story cycle, it provided the novelty of a chain of stories that they turned over into chapters of a novel. This fusion of genres reappeared in \"The Privileged\" where the narrative and the dramatic style cohabited side by side.\n\nRegarding the themes, Perpinyà has dedicated each book to a concrete topic. \"A Good Mistake\" is a love story in the world of science; \"A House to Compose\" recreates the world of music and architecture; \"The Privileged\" is about art and museums; \"The Calligraphers\" is about the university; and \"Mistana\" deals with the madness. Her novel, \"To the Vertigo\", the most romantic and pictorial one, is another important twist in her trajectory. She substituted – at least apparently – her intellectual world for the sport.\nHer novel and her play on the Internet are an online collective writing experiment. These books are written as a collage of Twitter sentences.\n\nThe first book of fiction by Perpinyà, \"Un bon error\" (\"A Good Mistake\") related the life of a young man who moved to laboratory in London and fell in love with a black scientist. The protagonist, Joan Xammar, must overcome two obstacles: the one of the gender and the one of race.\n\n\"A House to Compose\" (2001), is a story about a Pianist who was looking for a flat. In this novel about music, Perpinyà “dares to weave a multi-faceted plot”, and “while the protagonist passes through different kinds of housing – a garret, a duplex, an attic – (…) there is a kind of a musical whirlwind in her head”. The book had also an unusual structure: chained stories that ended up merging into a novel. The plot was the \"quête\" of the protagonist, Olivia Kesler, who was “a misanthrope of her art and a female Odysseus”. The novel is a crossword of genres and worlds: music, architecture and literature. \"A House to Compose\" is a harsh but comical critic to the architectonic dictatorship and suggested a romantic opposition between the artist and the society. The composer Olivia Kesler did not find her creative space in a society that was architectonically hostile to her.\n\nIn the third novel by Perpinyà, \"Mistana\" (National Critics Prize 2005), the realism was abandoned and the author opted for a fantastic style. The book narrated a story about a meteorologist with mental disorders who fell into misfortune when he arrived at a phantasmal town called Mistana with an everlasting Fog, inhabited by eccentric characters. An extreme climatology that evoked her home town, Lleida. The novel was “a tragedy about madness written in crescendo rhythm of delirious verses in prose” that has been labelled as “vertiginous and breathtaking” and as a “hypnotic and radical novel”. As Maria Dasca said, Mistana was “an unbridled fiction, tragic and comic at the same time” with a philosophical fog where “the things lose appearances and a man does not know who he is anymore”.\n\nIn 2013 \"To the Vertigo\" appeared, a novel about love between mountaineers. The protagonists were obsessive idealists isolated from the society. The plot revolved around loves of a solitary mountain climber, Irena Besikova. The novel suggested two important discussions: the one of passion and Feminism. The epistolary style developed until it became an adventure novel that, in the last chapters, adopted an unexpected metaliterary dimension. \"To the Vertigo\" was critically acclaimed.\n\nIn 2018, Perpinyà publishes the experimental novel \"And, suddenly, Paradise\" on Internet Addiction Disorder. The action takes place in a psychiatric. The work raises a debate about the advantages and disadvantages of the network, as well as discussing other behavioral disorders such as anorexia nervosa.\n\nIn 2007, \"The Privileged\" appeared. It is a comical dramatic novel in which the author thought about art, adopting a point of view of the guards in a Museum. The story narrated a restructuring of an old-fashioned museum into an Avant-garde museum, the sceptical attitudes of the guards towards the modern art, and the labour conflicts. The plot passed through vicissitudes of the main character, Mr. Serivà, a genuine, tragic and anti-heroic guard. The irony of the book is addressed to the ignorant audience and the art as a business and political platform. As Ponç Puigdevall said, the novel proofed the effort of the author “to discover new literary territories where the accuracy does not contradict the entertainment”.\n\n\"The Calligraphers\" (2010) is a tragicomedy about Philosophy of Education in Arts. The plot revolved around the closure of a University Department of Ancient Calligraphy and its substitution for a new degree in criminal calligraphic studies. This modernization of the University provoked tensions between the professors and it revealed jealousy and revenges. The play was opened in Lleida, at Escorxador Theatre, December 15, 2010, under the direction of Óscar Sánchez and it was performed by Imma Colomer, Pep Planas, Núria Casado and Ferran Farré.\n\n\"The Calligraphers\" is the staging of her essay \"More Than a Machine\". Both books are about education.\n\nThis twinning between genres occurs again in 2018 where the same story about the internet appears in a theatrical version (\"The Vice\") and in a novelistic version (\"And, suddenly, Paradise\").\n\nAmong Perpinyà’s academic researches, it is worth to mention the studies on a Catalan poet of the sixties, Gabriel Ferrater, a friend of Gil de Biedma and Carlos Barral. An atypical intellectual who had an important influence on the following generations similar to Robert Graves, Robert Frost or W.H. Auden. In her study \"\" (1997), Perpinyà analyzed the myth of Ferrater and did a deconstruction of the Catalan criticism. A polemic book “dedicated to all the sceptical readers who realize that, in the literary criticism, nothing completely innocent is ever said”.\n\nPerpinyà reappeared in 2008 with “a demythologizing essay”. \"\"; this book offered a wide view on different schools of Literary Theory. Written in “a casual style”, this essay particularly exemplified the theory with examples: twenty different interpretations about the Greek masterpiece.\n\nThe defense of humanistic Relativism can also be observed in her novels in which a kaleidoscope of attitudes related to a particular topic often appeared. In 2010, Perpinyà won an international essay prize for 21st-century editorial of Mexico for her work \"More than a Machine\". This essay is about education that extended from the Age of Enlightenment to the present days, and it pleaded for a creative learning against a routine one.\n\nIn 2014, Perpinya published her essay on Romanticism: \"Ruins, Nostalgia and Ugliness\" (2014) which analyzes the Romantic interest in the Middle Ages, from the eighteenth century to the successful series \"Game of Thrones\". Also, one of the theses of the book is considered Romantic, Ruins's pictures as a precedent of Avant-garde's Ugliness.\n\nIn 2018, appears her essay on the Catalan Avant-garde and Experimental Theatre, \"The Broken Chair\". The book analyzes the hundred years of Catalan, Russian, European Avant-garde Theatre and Theatre of the Absurd from the beginning of twentieth century to the present. It deals with scenography, politics and dramaturgy topics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriter interviews Canal 33. Anna Guitart. Viallibre. Cap. 73. 13-10-2013.

{"id": "42497945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42497945", "title": "Registrar (museum)", "text": "Registrar (museum)\n\nA registrar (museum) is responsible for implementing policies and procedures that relate to caring for collections of cultural institutions like archives, libraries, and museums. These policies are found in the museum's collections policy, the guiding tenet of the museum explaining why the institution is in operation, dictating the museum's professional standards regarding the objects left in its care. Registrars focus on sections that include acquisitions, loans, exhibitions, deaccessions, storage, packing and shipping, security of objects in transit, insurance policies, and risk management.\n\nAs a collections care professional, they work with collection managers, conservators, and curators to balance public access to objects with the conditions needed to maintain preservation. Focusing on documentation, registrars are responsible for developing and maintaining records management systems, with individual files for each object in the collection. Smaller and mid-sized institutions may combine the role of registrar with that of collections manager, while large institutions often have multiple registrars, each overseeing a different curatorial department.\n\nThe role of registrar was first defined in the early 1900s, and while the job description has not changed appreciably over time, the responsibilities have evolved with technology and increasing global awareness. Successful registrars deftly manage many projects at once, maintain calm focus, and diligent attention to detail. Collaborating with other departments and community associations is key.\n\nA selection of the most critical responsibilities include: \n\nA registrar should show strength and skill when handling objects. From physically moving an object to being able to identify any stress points or cultural significance, a registrar must take the initiative to study the museum's collection. They must be calm, flexible, resourceful, and focus on the details. Registrars can be described as academic generalists, who, over time, can develop specializations.\n\nWorking knowledge of American Association of Museum's Code of Ethics as well as the Collecting Guidelines for Museums should be required to be successful and respectful of any cultural or intrinsic objects. A registrar should be familiar with the AAM Guide to Provenance Research, as well as the Nazi-Era Provenance Internet Portal. A registrar should also be familiar with Digital Fair Use and the US Indemnity Program. In addition, a registrar should understand repatriation processes, both nationally and internationally.\n\nAs a member of a unique institution, a registrar must possess the ability to be successful in a team-oriented environment. Teaching qualities and customer service skills are helpful when trying to relay the importance of a collection's protection or access to a different department within the museum.\n\nIndividuals looking to begin a career in the Collections Management field generally possess a bachelor's degree in history, art history, fine arts, or a field related to museum interests. Many institutions now require a graduate education in museum studies or field relating to the museum's collections in this competitive job market. Candidates are also expected to have hands-on experience in museum collection database management, object packing and handling, digitization, collections cataloging, and accession and loan procedures.\n\nInternships and volunteer work in cultural institutions are excellent ways to gain experience and make connections with museum professionals. By taking initiative to acquire experience, paid or unpaid, a candidate will also develop their organizational skills, familiarity with procedure, and the inherent flexibility needed to succeed as a registrar.\n\nSmaller museums tend to combine the role of registrar with that of collection manager, in which case one person (or team) would oversee the traditional responsibilities of a registrar with the addition of a more hands-on role in collections care. Added duties include: overseeing and maintaining environmental conditions in storage and exhibition facilities, taking a more active role in conditions assessments and contacting conservators directly, managing physical storage needs, and taking inventory of the collection at regular intervals.\n\n\n\nState and regional associations (such as the Southeastern Registrar's Association) often organize classes, workshops, or conferences surrounding a contested topic or previously scheduled cultural event.\n"}
{"id": "33599991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33599991", "title": "Riot grrrl", "text": "Riot grrrl\n\nRiot grrrl is an underground feminist punk movement that began in the early 1990s in Washington state (particularly Olympia) and the greater Pacific Northwest. It also had origins in Washington, D.C. It is a subcultural movement that combines feminist consciousness and punk style and politics. It is often associated with third-wave feminism, which is sometimes seen as having grown out of the Riot Grrrl movement. It has also been described as a musical genre that came out of indie rock, with the punk scene serving as an inspiration for a musical movement in which women could express themselves in the same way men had been doing for the past several years.\n\nRiot grrrl bands often address issues such as rape, domestic abuse, sexuality, racism, patriarchy, and female empowerment. Primary bands associated with the movement include Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy, Excuse 17, Huggy Bear, Skinned Teen, Emily's Sassy Lime and Sleater-Kinney, as well as queercore groups like Team Dresch and The Third Sex. In addition to a music scene and genre, riot grrrl is a subculture involving a DIY ethic, zines, art, political action, and activism. The riot grrrl movement quickly spread well beyond its musical roots to create vibrant “zine” and World Wide Web-based movement, complete with local meetings and grassroots organizing to end ageism, homophobia, weightism, racism, sexism and, especially, physical and emotional violence against women and girls. Riot grrrls are known to hold meetings, start chapters, and support and organize women in music.\n\nDuring the late 1970s and early and mid-1980s there were a number of groundbreaking female punk and rock musicians who later influenced the riot grrrl ethos. These included Siouxsie Sioux, Poly Styrene, The Slits, Au Pairs, The Raincoats, Patti Smith, Chrissie Hynde, The Runaways/Joan Jett, The B-52's, LiLiPUT, Lydia Lunch, Exene Cervenka, Kim Gordon, Ut, Neo Boys, Bush Tetras, Y Pants, ESG, Chalk Circle, Fifth Column, Frightwig, X-Ray Spex, Scrawl, and Anti-Scrunti Faction. The 1980s also featured a number of female folk singers from New York whose lyrics were realistic and socio-political, but also personally intimate.\n\nDuring the mid-1980s in Vancouver the influential Mecca Normal fronted by poet Jean Smith formed, followed by Sugar Baby Doll in San Francisco whose members would all wind up in hardcore female bands. In 1987, the magazine \"Sassy\" premiered and dealt with tough subjects that conventional magazines aimed at teenage girls did not. An article \"Women, sex and rock and roll\" published by \"Puncture, edited by Katherine Spielmann,\" in 1989 became the first manifesto of the movement. In 1991, a radio program hosted by Lois Maffeo entitled \"Your Dream Girl\" aimed at angry young women debuted on Olympia, Washington radio station KAOS.\n\nDuring the early 1990s the Seattle/Olympia Washington area had a sophisticated do it yourself infrastructure. Young women involved in underground music scenes took advantage of this to articulate their feminist thoughts and desires through creating punk-rock fanzines and forming garage bands. The political model of collage-based, photocopied handbills and booklets was already used by the punk movement as a way to activate underground music, leftist politics and alternative (to mainstream) sub-cultures. There was a discomfort among many women in the punk movement who felt that they had no space for organizing, because of the misogyny in the punk culture. Many women found that while they identified with a larger, music-oriented subculture, they often had little to no voice in their local scenes. Women at the punk-rock shows saw themselves as girlfriends of the boys, so they took it upon themselves to represent their own interests by making their own fanzines, music and art.\n\nIn 1991, young women coalesced in an unorganized collective response to several women's issues, such as the Christian Coalition's Right to Life attack on legal abortion and the Senate Judiciary Hearings into Anita Hill's accusations of sexual harassment by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Young feminist voices were heard through multiple protests, actions, and events such as the formative opening night of the International Pop Underground Convention and later L7's Rock for Choice.\n\nUses and meanings of the term \"riot grrrl\" developed slowly over time, but its etymological origins can be traced to the actual Mount Pleasant race riots in spring 1991. Bratmobile member Jen Smith (later of Rastro! and The Quails), used the phrase \"girl riot\" in a letter to Allison Wolfe describing the atmosphere among women in the city. Soon afterwards, Wolfe and Molly Neuman collaborated with Kathleen Hanna and Tobi Vail to create a new zine and called it \"Riot Grrrl\", combining the \"riot\" with an oft-used phrase that first appeared in Vail's fanzine \"Jigsaw\" \"Revolution Grrrl Style Now\". Riot grrrls took a growling double or triple \"r\", placing it in the word \"girl\", as a way to take back the derogatory use of the term.\n\nKathleen Hanna had been studying at The Evergreen State College in Olympia. She participated in a small collective art gallery called Reko Muse, which would frequently host bands like The Go Team and Some Velvet Sidewalk to play in between art exhibitions (partially just to keep the gallery running). Hanna started a band, Amy Carter (named after the daughter of the US President Jimmy Carter), with fellow gallery-founders Heidi Arbogast and Tammy Rae Carland. After touring with some other projects like Viva Knievel, she hooked up with The Go Team drummer and zinester Tobi Vail, who had been writing of her own experiences:\n\nI feel completely left out of the realm of everything that is so important to me. And I know that this is partly because punk rock is for and by boys mostly and partly because punk rock of this generation is coming of age in a time of mindless career-goal bands.\n\nThey started working together on another fanzine called \"Bikini Kill\", which, after recruiting friends Kathi Wilcox and Billy \"Boredom\" Karren, would eventually become a band.\n\nAllison Wolfe met Molly Neuman at the University of Oregon. Wolfe introduced Neuman to bands such as Beat Happening and The Melvins, Neuman introduced Wolfe to sociology classes and Public Enemy.\n\nThey began working on zines called \"Girl Germs\", and later \"riot grrrl\" with Tobi Vail, Kathleen Hanna and Jen Smith.\n\nIt was a really hippie town, and we were getting really politicized, but also really into this DIY thing, so we kinda started creating. 'Let's make our own fanzine!'\n\nWolfe and Neuman started frequenting shows by bands like Fugazi and Nirvana. In 1990, Calvin Johnson called them up and asked them to play a show on Valentine's Day with Some Velvet Sidewalk and the newly formed Bikini Kill. They accepted it as a dare and played the show at Olympia's North Shore Surf club. Guitarist Erin Smith joined in March 1991.\n\nFrom August 20 – 25, 1991, K Records held an indie music festival called the International Pop Underground Convention. A promotional poster reads:\n\nAs the corporate ogre expands its creeping influence on the minds of industrialized youth, the time has come for the International Rockers of the World to convene in celebration of our grand independence. Hangman hipsters, new mod rockers, sidestreet walkers, scooter-mounted dream girls, punks, teds, the instigators of the Love Rock Explosion, the editors of every angry grrrl zine, the plotters of youth rebellion in every form, the midwestern librarians and Scottish ski instructors who live by night, all are setting aside August 20–25, 1991 as the time.\n\nAn all-female bill on the first night, called \"Love Rock Revolution Girl Style Now!\" signalled a major step in the movement. The lineup featured Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy, Nikki McClure, Lois Maffeo, Jean Smith of Mecca Normal, 7 Year Bitch, and two side projects of Kathleen Hanna: the first was Suture with Sharon Cheslow of Chalk Circle (DC's first all-women punk band) and Dug E. Bird of Beefeater, the second was the Wondertwins with Tim Green of Nation of Ulysses. It was here that so many zinester people who'd only known each other from networking, mail, or talking on the phone, finally met and were brought together by an entire night of music dedicated to, for, and by women.\n\nThe convention featured other bands such as Unwound, L7, The Fastbacks, The Spinanes, Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet, Girl Trouble, The Pastels, Kicking Giant, Rose Melberg, Seaweed, Kreviss, I Scream Truck, Scrawl, Nation of Ulysses, Jad Fair, Thee Headcoats, and Steve Fisk, and spoken-word artist Juliana Luecking.\n\nBy the mid-nineties, riot grrrl had severely splintered. Many within the movement felt that the mainstream media had completely misrepresented their message, and that the politically radical aspects of riot grrrl had been subverted by the likes of the Spice Girls and their \"girl power\" message, or co-opted by ostensibly women-centered bands (though sometimes with only one female performer per band) and festivals like Lilith Fair.\n\nOf the original riot grrrl bands, Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy and Huggy Bear had split in 1994, Excuse 17 and most of the UK bands had split by 1995, and Bikini Kill and Emily’s Sassy Lime released their last records in 1996. However, Team Dresch were active as late as 1998, The Gossip were active from 1999, Bratmobile reformed in 2000 and, perhaps most prolific of all, Sleater-Kinney were active - initially - from 1994 to 2006, releasing 7 albums.\n\nMany of the women involved in riot grrrl are still active in creating politically charged music. Kathleen Hanna went on to found the electro-feminist post-punk \"protest pop\" group Le Tigre and later The Julie Ruin, Kathi Wilcox joined The Casual Dots with Christina Billotte of Slant 6, and Tobi Vail formed Spider and the Webs. Corin Tucker of Heavens to Betsy and Carrie Brownstein of Excuse 17 co-founded Sleater-Kinney at the tail end of the original movement, and reformed the band again in 2014 after an 8-year hiatus, while Bratmobile reunited to release two albums, before Allison Wolfe began singing with other all-women bands, Cold Cold Hearts, and Partyline. Molly Neuman went on to play with New York punk band Love Or Perish and run her own indie label called Simple Social Graces Discos, as well as co-owning Lookout! Records and managing The Donnas, Ted Leo, Some Girls, and The Locust. Kaia Wilson of Team Dresch and multimedia artist Tammy Rae Carland went on to form the now-defunct Mr. Lady Records which released albums by The Butchies, The Need, Kiki and Herb, and Tracy + the Plastics.\n\nRiot grrrl culture is often associated with third wave feminism, which also grew rapidly during the same early nineties timeframe. The movement of third-wave feminism focused less on laws and the political process and more on individual identity. The movement of third-wave feminism is said to have arisen out of the realization that women are of many colors, ethnicities, nationalities, religions and cultural backgrounds. The riot grrrl movement allowed women their own space to create music and make political statements about the issues they were facing in the punk rock community and in society. They used their music and publications to express their views on issues such as patriarchy, double standards against women, rape, domestic abuse, sexuality, and female empowerment.\n\nAn undated, typewritten Bikini Kill tour flier answers the question \"What is Riot grrrl?\" with: \"[Riot Grrrl is ...] Because we girls want to create mediums that speak to US. We are tired of boy band after boy band, boy zine after boy zine, boy punk after boy punk after boy... Because we need to talk to each other. Communication and inclusion are key. We will never know if we don't break the code of silence... Because in every form of media we see ourselves slapped, decapitated, laughed at, objectified, raped, trivialized, pushed, ignored, stereotyped, kicked, scorned, molested, silenced, invalidated, knifed, shot, choked and killed. Because a safe space needs to be created for girls where we can open our eyes and reach out to each other without being threatened by this sexist society and our day to day bullshit.\"Like other third wave feminists, riot grrrls attempted to foster an acceptance of diversity within feminist expression. That relationship to feminism is evident through their use of lyrics, zines and publications, and taking back the meaning of derogatory terms. All three of these forms were claimed to be a source of empowerment for women in the movement.\n\nThe riot grrrl movement encouraged women to develop their own place in a male-dominated punk scene. Punk shows had come to be understood as places where \"women could make their way to the front of the crowd into the mosh pit, but had to 'fight ten times harder' because they were female, and sexually charged violence such as groping and rape had been reported.\"\n\nIn contrast, riot grrrl bands would often actively invite members of the audience to talk about their personal experiences with sensitive issues such as sexual abuse, pass out lyric sheets to everyone in the audience, and often demand that the mosh boys move to the back or side to allow space in front for the girls in the audience. The bands weren't always enthusiastically received at shows by male audience members. \"Punk Planet\" editor Daniel Sinker wrote in \"We Owe You Nothing\":\nThe vehemence fanzines large and small reserved for riot grrrl – and Bikini Kill in particular – was shocking. The punk zine editors' use of 'bitches', 'cunts', 'man-haters', and 'dykes' was proof-positive that sexism was still strong in the punk scene.\n\nKathi Wilcox said in a fanzine interview:\n\nKathleen Hanna would later write: \"It was also super schizo to play shows where guys threw stuff at us, called us cunts and yelled \"take it off\" during our set, and then the next night perform for throngs of amazing girls singing along to every lyric and cheering after every song.\"\n\nMany men were supporters of riot grrrl culture and acts. Calvin Johnson and Slim Moon have been instrumental in publishing riot grrrl bands on the labels they founded, K Records and Kill Rock Stars respectively. Alec Empire of Atari Teenage Riot said, \"I was totally into the riot grrrl music, I see it as a very important form of expression. I learned a lot from that, way more maybe than from 'male' punk rock.\" Dave Grohl and Kurt Cobain dated Kathleen Hanna and Tobi Vail (also respectively), and often played with Bikini Kill even after splitting with them; Kurt was a big fan of The Slits and even convinced The Raincoats to reform. He once said, \"The future of rock belongs to women.\" Many riot grrrl bands included male band members, such as Billy Karren of Bikini Kill or Jon Slade and Chris Rawley of Huggy Bear.\n\nMolly Neuman once summarized: \"We're not anti-boy, we're pro-girl.\" Riot grrrl concerts provided a safe haven for women, and often addressed issues such as rape, domestic abuse, sexuality and female empowerment. For example, in Bikini Kill's \"Don't Need You\", they sing: \"don’t need you to say we’re cute/don’t need you to say we’re alright/don’t need your protection/don’t need your kiss goodnight\", rejecting stereotypical heterosexual relationship dynamics.\n\nInfluenced heavily by DIY culture, most bands' presentation subverted traditional or classically trained 'musicianship' in favor of raw, primitive, avant-lo-fi passion and fiercely deliberate amateurism: an idea growing rapidly in popularity, especially in the Olympia music scene, with bands like Beat Happening coining the slogans: \"Learn how to NOT play your instrument\" and \"hey, you don't have to sound like the flavor of the month, all you have to do is sound like yourselves\", arguing that traditional musical skill doesn't ultimately matter and should always be subservient to the passion, the fun and ideas in their music. This argument is similar to the ideological origins of punk rock itself, which started partially as an attempt to dissolve the growing division between audience and performer. These indie-punk bands (and riot grrrl bands in particular) were often ridiculed for \"not being able to play their instruments\", but fans are quick to counter that identical criticisms were often faced by the first-wave of punk rock bands in the 1970s, and that this DIY garage amateurism \"play just 'cause you wanna, no matter what\" attitude was one of the most appealing and liberating aspects of both movements.\n\nOther bands and artists associated with the riot grrrl movement in one way or another include - in the US - Slant 6, Sta-Prest, Sue P. Fox, Jenny Toomey, Adickdid, Tattle Tale, Jack Off Jill, The Need, Nomy Lamm, Lucid Nation, The Frumpies, Bangs, Crown for Athena, TummyAche, The Third Sex, Canopy, Cheesecake, Clever Boy (Annika Bentley) Growing Up Skipper, The Fucking Angels, Pagan Holiday, The Quails, Giant Kitty; in the UK, bands like Blood Sausage, Mambo Taxi, Voodoo Queens, Pussycat Trash, Golden Starlet, Witchknot, Frantic Spiders, Linus, Sister George, Lungleg, Sally Skull, Hello Skinny and Coping Saw (who featured Leeds fanzine writer Karren Ablaze); and in Brazil, bands like Dominatrix, Kaos Klitoriano and Menstruação Anarquika. In Tasmania, Australia – \"The Little Ugly Girls\" led by Linda J. Dacio identified with the riot grrrl movement. Letters between the band's drummer \"Sloth\" and Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill would soon see the bands share a stage in Hobart, Australia.\n\nThere were also many girl-centric or all-women punk and queercore bands of this era, such as Calamity Jane, 7 Year Bitch, Red Aunts, Autoclave, Thee Headcoatees, Spitboy, Scissor Girls, and Tribe 8, who did not self-identify with the 'riot grrrl' label, despite sharing similar DIY tactics and feminist ideologies.\n\nAs media attention increasingly focused on Grunge and Alternative Rock in the early nineties, the term \"Riot Grrrl\" was often applied to less political female or female-fronted alternative rock acts such as Babes in Toyland, The Breeders, The Gits, 7 Year Bitch, Hole, Lunachicks, Dickless, L7, PJ Harvey, Liz Phair, Veruca Salt, and even No Doubt - although the latter band formed and performed during this era, they began as a SoCal-based and non-Alternative\nSka/Punk/Oí group. They retained this style prior to, and after, their major label signing with The Beacon Street Collection and breakout album Tragic Kingdom, remaining as such through their debut studio album release, the assotiated and frontline solo tours, Festivals, plus the longtime collaborations with Sublime before the initial sound and style drifted into the other genres and the ultimate solo act from Gwen Stefani - and – although the term could arguably apply to L7 due to their involvement in the creation of Rock for Choice, a series of concerts and compilation albums designed to raise money and awareness for abortion rights and protection of women's health clinics. To their chagrin, riot grrrls found themselves in the media spotlight during 1992, accused of dragging feminism into the mosh pit in magazines from \"Seventeen\" to \"Newsweek\". Fallout from the media coverage led to resignations from the movement of people like Jessica Hopper, who was at the center of the \"Newsweek\" article. Kathleen Hanna called that year for \"a press block\". In an essay from January 1994, included in the CD version of Bikini Kill's first two records, Tobi Vail responded to media simplifications and mis-characterization of Riot Grrrl:\none huge misconception for instance that has been repeated over and over again in magazines we have never spoken to and also by those who believe these sources without checking things out themselves is that Bikini Kill is the definitive 'riot girl band' ... We are not in anyway 'leaders of' or authorities on the 'Riot Girl' movement. In fact, as individuals we have each had different experiences with, feelings on, opinions of and varying degrees of involvement with 'Riot Girl' and though we totally respect those who still feel that label is important and meaningful to them, we have never used that term to describe ourselves AS A BAND. As individuals we respect and utilize and subscribe to a variety of different aesthetics, strategies, and beliefs, both political and punk-wise, some of which are probably considered 'riot girl.'\n\nWriter/musician/historian/artist Sharon Cheslow said in EMP's \"Riot Grrrl Retrospective\" documentary:\n\nThere were a lot of very important ideas that I think the mainstream media couldn't handle, so it was easier to focus on the fact that these were girls who were wearing barrettes in their hair or writing 'slut' on their stomach.\n\nCorin Tucker of Heavens to Betsy and Sleater-Kinney said:\n\nI think it was deliberate that we were made to look like we were just ridiculous girls parading around in our underwear. They refused to do serious interviews with us, they misprinted what we had to say, they would take our articles, and our fanzines, and our essays and take them out of context. We wrote a lot about sexual abuse and sexual assault for teenagers and young women. I think those are really important concepts that the media \"never\" addressed.\n\nEven as the Seattle-area rock scene came to international mainstream media attention, riot grrrl remained a willfully underground phenomenon. Most musicians shunned the major record labels, devotedly working instead with indie labels such as Kill Rock Stars, K Records, Slampt, Piao! Records, Simple Machines, Catcall, WIIIJA and Chainsaw Records. The movement also figured fairly prominently in cassette culture, with artists often starting their own DIY cassette labels by as basic and spartan a means as recording their music onto cheap off-the-shelf boom-boxes and passing the cassettes out to friends, seldom charging anything beyond the cost of the actual tapes themselves.\n\nRiot grrrl's momentum was also hugely supported by an explosion of creativity in defiantly homemade cut and paste, xeroxed, collagey zines that covered a variety of feminist topics, frequently attempting to draw out the political implications of intensely personal experiences in a \"privately public\" space. Zines often described experiences with sexism, mental illness, body image and eating disorders, sexual abuse, racism, rape, discrimination, stalking, domestic violence, incest, homophobia, and sometimes vegetarianism. Grrrl zine editors are collectively engaged in forms of writing and writing instruction that challenge both dominant notions of the author as an individualized, bodiless space and notions of feminism as primarily an adult political project.\n\nThese zines were archived by zinewiki.com, and Riot Grrrl Press, started in Washington DC in 1992 by Erika Reinstein & May Summer. Others can be found anthologized in \"A Girl's Guide to Taking over the World: Writings from the Girl Zine Revolution\", for which actress/singer/musician/writer/performance artist Ann Magnuson of Bongwater fame wrote as a foreword:\n\nWhen I think of how much benefit my teenage self could have gained from the multitude of zines that have proliferated over the past decade, I weep for all the lost potential. Except for Joan of Arc and Anne Frank, the thoughts of teenage girls have rarely been taken seriously.\n\nBands would often attempt to reappropriate derogatory phrases like \"cunt\", \"bitch\", \"dyke\", and \"slut\", writing them proudly on their skin with lipstick or fat markers. Kathleen Hanna was writing \"slut\" on her stomach at shows as early as 1992, intentionally fusing feminist art and activist practices. Riot grrrls making political statements to reclaim phrases is a common theme among third-wave feminists. Not only did their music address the same issues as third-wave feminism, but they took a political stance against the oppression they were feeling.\n\nMany of the women involved with queercore were also interested in riot grrrl, and zines such as \"Chainsaw\" by Donna Dresch, \"Sister Nobody\", \"Jane Gets A Divorce\" and \"I (heart) Amy Carter\" by Tammy Rae Carland embody both movements. There were also national conventions like in Washington, D.C., or the Pussystock festival in New York City, as well as various subsequent indie-documentaries like \"Don't Need You: the Herstory of Riot Grrrl\".\n\nStarting during the fall of 2010, the \"Riot Grrrl Collection\" has been housed at New York University's Fales Library and Special Collections, as \"The Fales Riot Grrrl Collection\". The collection's primary mandate is \"to collect unique materials that provide documentation of the creative process of individuals and the chronology of the [Riot Grrrl] movement overall\". Kathleen Hanna, Johanna Fateman, and Becca Albee have donated primary source material, while Molly Neuman, Allison Wolfe, Kathi Wilcox, and Carrie Brownstein are expected to donate material shortly. The collection is the brainchild of Lisa Darms, Senior Archivist at the Fales Library. According to Jenna Freedman, a librarian who maintains a zine collection at Barnard College, \"It's just essential to preserve the activist voices in their own unmediated work, especially because of the media blackout that they called for\". Kathleen Hanna, while understanding no collection can replicate the concert experience, feels the collection is a safe place that will be \"free from feminist erasure\".\n\nThe \"Riot Grrrl\" movement has received criticism for not being inclusive enough. Riot Girls are often accused of being separatists: they want to form a life away from men and invent \"girl culture\". One major argument is that the movement focuses on middle-class white women, alienating other kinds of women. This criticism emerged early in the movement. In 1993, Ramdasha Bikceem wrote in her zine, \"Gunk\", \nRiot grrrl calls for change, but I question who it's including ... I see Riot Grrrl growing very closed to a very few i.e. white middle class punk girls.Musician Courtney Love has criticized the movement for being too doctrinaire and censorious:\nLook, you've got these highly intelligent imperious girls, but who told them it was their undeniable American right not to be offended? Being offended is part of being in the real world. I'm offended every time I see George Bush on TV!\n\nSome have suggested that, while riot grrrl bands worked to ensure their shows were safe spaces in which women could find solidarity and create their own subculture, they have excluded transwomen from events such as The Michigan's Womyn's Music Festival, which has a womyn born-womyn policy. Former members of Le Tigre have seen protests at shows for participating in the festival.\n\nThe legacy of riot grrrl is clearly visible in numerous girls and women worldwide who cite the movement as an interest or an influence on their lives and/or their work. Some of them are self-proclaimed riot grrrls while others consider themselves simply admirers or fans. There are many fansites and message boards for riot grrrl on the internet. In an age where Internet is the most accessible platform for individuals to express themselves, the Riot Grrrl online community has risen in popularity in recent years. Not only do these online platforms capture discussion regarding larger topics of systemic oppression, but they also provide space for girls to express smaller issues—the successes and challenges of their everyday lives. It is a forum that allows for self-determined feminism and genuine, open expression, a core part of the Riot Grrrl message that’s greatest power is giving girls the room to decide for themselves who they are. As both a purported musical genre and as a subculture, riot grrrl has been acclaimed as an influence on contemporary groups as varied as Kitten Forever, Skating Polly, The Shondes and The Ethical Debating Society. Besides that, the Riot Grrrl movement has been a strong influence not only for the punk-rock scene but also for other kinds of music. \n\nIn the foreword to \"Riot Grrrl: Revolution Girl Style Now!\" Beth Ditto writes of riot grrrl,\nA movement formed by a handful of girls who felt empowered, who were angry, hilarious, and extreme through and for each other. Built on the floors of strangers' living rooms, tops of Xerox machines, snail mail, word of mouth and mixtapes, riot grrrl reinvented punk.\n\nWriting about riot grrrl's personal influence on her and her music, she muses on the meaning of the movement for her generation, Until I found riot grrrl, or riot grrrl found me I was just another Gloria Steinem NOW feminist trying to take a stand in shop class. Now I am a musician, a writer, a whole person.\n\nMany women write to Hanna in hopes of reviving the Riot Grrrl Movement. Hanna says, “Don’t revive it, make something better\". In 2010 \"Girls to the Front: The True Story of the Riot Grrrl Revolution\", by Sara Marcus, was published. It is the first published history of the Riot Grrrl movement. Sara Marcus herself had attended Riot Grrrl meetings. As of now there are approximately ten weekly Riot Girl meetings nationwide, and bands multiplying faster than can be counted.\n\nIn 2013 Astria Suparak and Ceci Moss curated \"Alien She\", an exhibition examining the impact of Riot Grrrl on artists and cultural producers. Alien She focuses on seven people whose visual art practices were informed by their contact with Riot Grrrl. Many of them work in multiple disciplines, such as sculpture, installation, video, documentary film, photography, drawing, printmaking, new media, social practice, curation, music, writing and performance—a reflection of the movement's artistic diversity and mutability. It opened September 2013 at the Miller Gallery at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, and ran through February the following year. It visited four subsequent museums (Vox Populi in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, March – April 2014; Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco, October 2014 – January 2015; Orange County Museum of Art, Newport Beach, California, February – May 2015; and Pacific Northwest College of Art: 511 Gallery and the Museum of Contemporary Craft in Portland, Oregon, September 3, 2015 – January 9, 2016).\n\nThe term \"grrrl\" (or \"grrl\") itself has since been co-opted or used by agencies as diverse as advocacy on behalf of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (GRRL POWER 1.0 5-PACK / Memetics for the Ladies) and a roller derby league in Singapore.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6735375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6735375", "title": "Roger de Piles", "text": "Roger de Piles\n\nRoger de Piles (7 October 1635 – 5 April 1709) was a French painter, engraver, art critic and diplomat.\n\nBorn in Clamecy, Roger de Piles studied philosophy and theology, and devoted himself to painting.\n\nIn 1662 he became tutor to Michel Amelot de Gournay, whom he was to follow throughout his life, acting as secretary to his various missions as French ambassador to Venice, Portugal, Spain.\n\nIn Venice (1682–1685) he started a famous collection of prints, drawings and paintings of Giorgione, Correggio, Rembrandt, Claude Lorrain, Rubens, Antoine Coypel, Jean-Baptiste Forest.\n\nHe also acquired a taste for political intrigue using his travels ostensibly undertaken to study the European collections, as a buyer for Louis XIV, as cover for confidential missions - for example in Germany and Austria (1685) on behalf of Louis' minister, the marquis de Louvois.\n\nHe was not always fortunate as a spy. In 1692, during the War of the League of Augsburg, he was arrested in the Hague carrying a false passport and imprisoned for the next five years. He spent his time writing \"L'Abrégé de la vie des peintres ...avec un traité du peintre parfait\". published in 1699 following his appointement as Conseiller Honoraire to the Académie de peinture et de sculpture.\n\nIn 1705 he followed Amelot de Gournay to Spain but illness forced him to return to Paris, where he died in 1709.\n\nHis important contribution to aesthetic theory rests on his \"Dialogue sur le coloris\" (\"Dialogue on colours\"), in which he initiated his famous defence of Rubens in the argument started in 1671 by Philippe de Champaigne on the relative merits of drawing and color in the work of Titian (in a lecture to the Académie de peinture et de sculpture on Titian's \"Virgin and Child with St John\".)\n\nThe argument is most fascinating as an early debate on classic vs modern in painting; in essence on the mathematics of proportion and perspective in drawing—the classic approach— as opposed to the colored brush stroke—the approach of the moderns. In his detailed study of the argument, \"Roger de Piles et les débats sur le coloris au siècle de Louis XIV\" (1965), B. Teyssèdre gives a touching account of the \"bohème\" of the \"modern\" \"réfusés\" in seventeenth century Paris, a history that was to repeat itself with the Impressionists.\n\nIn the course of the argument Roger de Piles introduced the term \"clair-obscur\" (Chiaroscuro) to highlight the effect of color in accentuating the tension between light and dark in a painting.\n\nThe way Roger de Piles documented his argument with Venetian and northern European examples was of influence to Antoine Coypel, Hyacinthe Rigaud, Nicolas de Largillière and François de Troy.\n\nTo his last published work: \"Cours de peinture par principes avec un balance de peintres\" (1708) de Piles appended a list of fifty-six major painters with whose work he had acquainted himself as a connoisseur during his travels.\n\nTo each painter in the list he gave marks from 0 to 18 for composition, drawing, color and expression. This gave an overview of aesthetic appreciation hinging on the balance between color and design. The highest marks went to Raffaello Sanzio and Rubens, with a slight bias on color for Rubens, a slight bias on drawing for Raphaël. Painters who scored very badly in anything but color were Giovanni Bellini, Giorgione and remarkably Michelangelo Caravaggio with 16 on color and 0 (zero) on expression. Painters who fell far behind Rubens and Raphaël but whose balance between color and design was perfect were Lucas van Leyden, Sebastian Bourdon, Albrecht Dürer.\n\nThe complete list is transcribed here from Manlio Brusatin:\"Histoire des couleurs\" (Paris: Flammarion, 1986, pp. 103–104), reproduced in Elisabeth G. Holt \"Literary Sources of Art History\", (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1947), pp. 415–416\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "44953636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44953636", "title": "Seattle Camera Club", "text": "Seattle Camera Club\n\nThe Seattle Camera Club (SCC) was an organization of photographers active in Seattle, Washington, during the 1920s. It was founded in 1924 by Japanese immigrants and thrived for the next five years. The SCC was the only Japanese American photography club to include both Caucasians and women photographers as members, and because of their inclusivity their members were among the most exhibited photographers in the world at that time.\n\nThe 39 charter members of the club were all Japanese men. Unlike other prominent clubs of Japanese photographers, they decided at the beginning to welcome women and Caucasian members. The driving force behind the club’s formation was Dr. Kyo Koike, who was a well‒respected medical doctor in Seattle’s Issei community.\n\nThey held monthly meetings at 508½ Main Street near Dr. Koike’s office. At these meetings members critiqued each other’s prints and discussed current ideas about photography. Dr. Koike wrote about these discussions in their monthly bulletin, as well as descriptions of photography trips the members had taken, names of those members who had exhibited recently, and commentaries about photography in general.\n\nThe club’s bulletin was called \"Notan\", which is a Japanese term that roughly translates as “light and shade”. These were qualities that defined the primary elements of a Japanese style of pictorialism that most of the original members prized. Many of their photographs contained strong lighting and rhythmical patterns that emphasized the artistic quality of a scene.\n\nIn 1925 the club began its own salon, which originally featured photographs by its own members but later expanded to an international field of photographers. The artistic strength of their membership is indicated by the fact that in 1926 members of the club showed a collective 589 prints in different exhibitions around the world. That same year \"Photo‒Era\" magazine offered a trophy for the photography club whose members won the most awards in the magazine’s competitions. The first winner of the trophy was the Seattle Camera Club.\n\nThe club reached its peak membership in 1925 with 85 members, including several photographers who in lived in other areas of the country. Two prominent Seattle women, Ella McBride and Virna Haffer, were among the club’s members by that time. Only one‒quarter of the members then were Japanese Americans.\n\nSoon thereafter the membership in the club began to decline, primarily due to increasing economic difficulties that led up to the 1929 Great Depression. Many members held low-paying jobs, and with increased prices and a scarcity of jobs they could no longer afford to buy film or other photographic supplies. On October 11, 1929 the club held a farewell meeting. Only 7 members attended, and they formally disbanded the club at that time.\n\nSome of the more well-to-do members, like Koike and Matsushita, continued to make photographs and exhibit them when they could. All of their efforts ended with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December, 1941. Soon thereafter almost all of the Japanese American community in Seattle was transported to the Japanese American internment camps in Idaho or Montana.\n\nKyo Koike was a medical doctor who had a thriving practice in the Japanese community in Seattle. His professional income allowed him not only to concentrate on his photography but to underwrite many of the expenses of forming the club. He was the editor of the club's newsletter \"Notan\". During World War II all of his photographic equipment was confiscated by the U.S. government, and he was taken to the Minidoka National Historic Site in Idaho. He remained there until the end of the war, but while there he fell ill and never recovered. He died shortly after he was allowed to return to Seattle in 1947. He left all of his photographs and extensive records of the Seattle Camera Club to fellow club member Iwao Matsushita.\n\nHideo Onishi (1890‒after 1934) was employed as a restaurant cook, but he was a prolific and very successful photographer. In 1926 he was the club’s top exhibitor for the year, and that same year more than 1,000 people attended an exhibition of his photographs at the Japanese Commercial Club in Seattle. He sold 233 copies of his prints at that exhibition and gave the profits to SCC.\n\nFrank Asakichi Kunishige (1978‒1960) was one of the original members of SCC and one of only a few club members who had formal training in photography. In 1911 he attended photography school in Illinois, and after moving to Seattle he worked in the darkrooms of Edward Curtis and Ella McBride. Because of his training and experience he was one of the technical experts of the club. He created and sold his own photographic paper, Textura Tissue, which was a favorite of club members because it emphasized the soft qualities that Pictorial photographers prized. During World War II he and his wife were sent to the Minidoka Internment Camp in Idaho. After their release they returned to Seattle, but he did not take up photography again.\n\nSoichi Sunami (1885‒1971) learned photography in Seattle while working as an assistant at the studio of Ella McBride. In 1922 he moved to New York to study at Art Students League, where there he photographed student dancers and artists. He also continued showing his photographs at SCC and was one of the most active non‒resident members of the club. Later he became of the main photographers for the Museum of Modern Art and continued to work there for 38 years.\n\nVirna Haffer (1899-1974) was an accomplished, innovative, internationally renowned photographer, printmaker, painter, musician, and published author. Born in 1899 in Aurora, Illinois, Virna Haffer and her family made the move to the Utopian community of Home, in South Puget Sound in Washington State in 1907. Haffer began her journey as a professional photographer when she was just 15 years old when she became the apprentice of the accomplished photographer, Harriette H. Ihrig. She opened her own portrait photography studio in Tacoma, Washington and began publishing her photographs in 1924. Haffer was known for experimenting with unusual, quirky techniques and created her own artistic style that stretched the boundaries of artistic classifications in the early twentieth century. Haffer's work was eccentric; she produced pictorialist, modern, surreal, and documentary style work. Virna Haffer's work was first exhibited in 1924 in the Fifth Annual F&N Salon of Pictorial Photography, and in 1928 at the Seattle Camera Club's Fourth International Exhibition. By 1930 her work was internationally recognized, and often appeared in publications such as the \"American Annual of Photography\". In addition, she won recognition and prizes in photographic competitions in the United States in the 1930's. In the 1960's she took an interest in producing photograms, and was so successful that in 1969 she published a book about the process of making a photogram called \"Making Photograms: The Creative Process of Painting With Light\". Haffer's work was also the subject of several solo exhibitions not limited to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1960; Museum of Science & Industry, Los Angeles, 1964; New York Camera Club, 1967 and the Museum of Contemporary Arts & Crafts, NYC, 1968.\n\n\nMartin, David F. and Nicolette Bromberg. \"Shadows of a Fleeting World: Pictorial Photography and the Seattle Camera Club.\" Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2011. \n\nReed, Dennis. \"Making Waves: Japanese American Photography, 1920‒940. \" Los Angeles: Japanese American National Museum, 2016. \n\nTsutakawa, Mayumi. \"They Painted from Their Hearts: Pioneers Asian American Artists. \" Seattle: Wing Luke Asian Museum, 1993. \n"}

{"id": "321671", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=321671", "title": "Tessellation", "text": "Tessellation\n\nA tessellation of a flat surface is the tiling of a plane using one or more geometric shapes, called tiles, with no overlaps and no gaps. In mathematics, tessellations can be generalized to higher dimensions and a variety of geometries.\n\nA periodic tiling has a repeating pattern. Some special kinds include regular tilings with regular polygonal tiles all of the same shape, and semiregular tilings with regular tiles of more than one shape and with every corner identically arranged. The patterns formed by periodic tilings can be categorized into 17 wallpaper groups. A tiling that lacks a repeating pattern is called \"non-periodic\". An aperiodic tiling uses a small set of tile shapes that cannot form a repeating pattern. In the geometry of higher dimensions, a space-filling or honeycomb is also called a \"tessellation of space\".\n\nA real physical tessellation is a tiling made of materials such as cemented ceramic squares or hexagons. Such tilings may be decorative patterns, or may have functions such as providing durable and water-resistant pavement, floor or wall coverings. Historically, tessellations were used in Ancient Rome and in Islamic art such as in the decorative geometric tiling of the Alhambra palace. In the twentieth century, the work of M. C. Escher often made use of tessellations, both in ordinary Euclidean geometry and in hyperbolic geometry, for artistic effect. Tessellations are sometimes employed for decorative effect in quilting. Tessellations form a class of patterns in nature, for example in the arrays of hexagonal cells found in honeycombs.\n\nTessellations were used by the Sumerians (about 4000 BC) in building wall decorations formed by patterns of clay tiles.\n\nDecorative mosaic tilings made of small squared blocks called tesserae were widely employed in classical antiquity, sometimes displaying geometric patterns.\n\nIn 1619 Johannes Kepler made an early documented study of tessellations. He wrote about regular and semiregular tessellations in his \"Harmonices Mundi\"; he was possibly the first to explore and to explain the hexagonal structures of honeycomb and snowflakes.\n\nSome two hundred years later in 1891, the Russian crystallographer Yevgraf Fyodorov proved that every periodic tiling of the plane features one of seventeen different groups of isometries. Fyodorov's work marked the unofficial beginning of the mathematical study of tessellations. Other prominent contributors include Aleksei Shubnikov and Nikolai Belov (1964), and Heinrich Heesch and Otto Kienzle (1963).\n\nIn Latin, \"tessella\" is a small cubical piece of clay, stone or glass used to make mosaics. The word \"tessella\" means \"small square\" (from \"tessera\", square, which in turn is from the Greek word τέσσερα for \"four\"). It corresponds to the everyday term \"tiling\", which refers to applications of tessellations, often made of glazed clay.\n\nTessellation in two dimensions, also called planar tiling, is a topic in geometry that studies how shapes, known as \"tiles\", can be arranged to fill a plane without any gaps, according to a given set of rules. These rules can be varied. Common ones are that there must be no gaps between tiles, and that no corner of one tile can lie along the edge of another. The tessellations created by bonded brickwork do not obey this rule. Among those that do, a regular tessellation has both identical regular tiles and identical regular corners or vertices, having the same angle between adjacent edges for every tile. There are only three shapes that can form such regular tessellations: the equilateral triangle, square, and regular hexagon. Any one of these three shapes can be duplicated infinitely to fill a plane with no gaps.\n\nMany other types of tessellation are possible under different constraints. For example, there are eight types of semi-regular tessellation, made with more than one kind of regular polygon but still having the same arrangement of polygons at every corner. Irregular tessellations can also be made from other shapes such as pentagons, polyominoes and in fact almost any kind of geometric shape. The artist M. C. Escher is famous for making tessellations with irregular interlocking tiles, shaped like animals and other natural objects. If suitable contrasting colours are chosen for the tiles of differing shape, striking patterns are formed, and these can be used to decorate physical surfaces such as church floors.\n\nMore formally, a tessellation or tiling is a cover of the Euclidean plane by a countable number of closed sets, called \"tiles\", such that the tiles intersect only on their boundaries. These tiles may be polygons or any other shapes. Many tessellations are formed from a finite number of prototiles in which all tiles in the tessellation are congruent to the given prototiles. If a geometric shape can be used as a prototile to create a tessellation, the shape is said to \"tessellate\" or to \"tile the plane\". The Conway criterion is a sufficient but not necessary set of rules for deciding if a given shape tiles the plane periodically without reflections: some tiles fail the criterion but still tile the plane. No general rule has been found for determining if a given shape can tile the plane or not, which means there are many unsolved problems concerning tessellations.\n\nMathematically, tessellations can be extended to spaces other than the Euclidean plane. The Swiss geometer Ludwig Schläfli pioneered this by defining \"polyschemes\", which mathematicians nowadays call polytopes. These are the analogues to polygons and polyhedra in spaces with more dimensions. He further defined the Schläfli symbol notation to make it easy to describe polytopes. For example, the Schläfli symbol for an equilateral triangle is {3}, while that for a square is {4}. The Schläfli notation makes it possible to describe tilings compactly. For example, a tiling of regular hexagons has three six-sided polygons at each vertex, so its Schläfli symbol is {6,3}.\n\nOther methods also exist for describing polygonal tilings. When the tessellation is made of regular polygons, the most common notation is the vertex configuration, which is simply a list of the number of sides of the polygons around a vertex. The square tiling has a vertex configuration of 4.4.4.4, or 4. The tiling of regular hexagons is noted 6.6.6, or 6.\n\nMathematicians use some technical terms when discussing tilings. An \"edge\" is the intersection between two bordering tiles; it is often a straight line. A \"vertex\" is the point of intersection of three or more bordering tiles. Using these terms, an \"isogonal\" or vertex-transitive tiling is a tiling where every vertex point is identical; that is, the arrangement of polygons about each vertex is the same. The fundamental region is a shape such as a rectangle that is repeated to form the tessellation. For example, a regular tessellation of the plane with squares has a meeting of four squares at every vertex.\n\nThe sides of the polygons are not necessarily identical to the edges of the tiles. An edge-to-edge tiling is any polygonal tessellation where adjacent tiles only share one full side, i.e., no tile shares a partial side or more than one side with any other tile. In an edge-to-edge tiling, the sides of the polygons and the edges of the tiles are the same. The familiar \"brick wall\" tiling is not edge-to-edge because the long side of each rectangular brick is shared with two bordering bricks.\n\nA \"normal tiling\" is a tessellation for which every tile is topologically equivalent to a disk, the intersection of any two tiles is a single connected set or the empty set, and all tiles are uniformly bounded. This means that a single circumscribing radius and a single inscribing radius can be used for all the tiles in the whole tiling; the condition disallows tiles that are pathologically long or thin.\n\nA monohedral tiling is a tessellation in which all tiles are congruent; it has only one prototile. A particularly interesting type of monohedral tessellation is the spiral monohedral tiling. The first spiral monohedral tiling was discovered by Heinz Voderberg in 1936; the Voderberg tiling has a unit tile that is a nonconvex enneagon. The Hirschhorn tiling, published by Michael D. Hirschhorn and D. C. Hunt in 1985, is a pentagon tiling using irregular pentagons: regular pentagons cannot tile the Euclidean plane as the internal angle of a regular pentagon, , is not a divisor of 2.\n\nAn isohedral tiling is a special variation of a monohedral tiling in which all tiles belong to the same transitivity class, that is, all tiles are transforms of the same prototile under the symmetry group of the tiling. If a prototile admits a tiling, but no such tiling is isohedral, then the prototile is called anisohedral and forms anisohedral tilings.\n\nA regular tessellation is a highly symmetric, edge-to-edge tiling made up of regular polygons, all of the same shape. There are only three regular tessellations: those made up of equilateral triangles, squares, or regular hexagons. All three of these tilings are isogonal and monohedral.\n\nA semi-regular (or Archimedean) tessellation uses more than one type of regular polygon in an isogonal arrangement. There are eight semi-regular tilings (or nine if the mirror-image pair of tilings counts as two). These can be described by their vertex configuration; for example, a semi-regular tiling using squares and regular octagons has the vertex configuration 4.8 (each vertex has one square and two octagons). Many non-edge-to-edge tilings of the Euclidean plane are possible, including the family of Pythagorean tilings, tessellations that use two (parameterised) sizes of square, each square touching four squares of the other size. An edge tessellation is one in which each tile can be reflected over an edge to take up the position of a neighbouring tile, such as in an array of equilateral or isosceles triangles.\n\nTilings with translational symmetry in two independent directions can be categorized by wallpaper groups, of which 17 exist. It has been claimed that all seventeen of these groups are represented in the Alhambra palace in Granada, Spain. Though this is disputed, the variety and sophistication of the Alhambra tilings have surprised modern researchers. Of the three regular tilings two are in the \"p6m\" wallpaper group and one is in \"p4m\". Tilings in 2D with translational symmetry in just one direction can be categorized by the seven frieze groups describing the possible frieze patterns. Orbifold notation can be used to describe wallpaper groups of the Euclidean plane.\n\nPenrose tilings, which use two different quadrilateral prototiles, are the best known example of tiles that forcibly create non-periodic patterns. They belong to a general class of aperiodic tilings, which use tiles that cannot tessellate periodically. The recursive process of substitution tiling is a method of generating aperiodic tilings. One class that can be generated in this way is the rep-tiles; these tilings have surprising self-replicating properties. Pinwheel tilings are non-periodic, using a rep-tile construction; the tiles appear in infinitely many orientations. It might be thought that a non-periodic pattern would be entirely without symmetry, but this is not so. Aperiodic tilings, while lacking in translational symmetry, do have symmetries of other types, by infinite repetition of any bounded patch of the tiling and in certain finite groups of rotations or reflections of those patches. A substitution rule, such as can be used to generate some Penrose patterns using assemblies of tiles called rhombs, illustrates scaling symmetry. A Fibonacci word can be used to build an aperiodic tiling, and to study quasicrystals, which are structures with aperiodic order.\n\nWang tiles are squares coloured on each edge, and placed so that abutting edges of adjacent tiles have the same colour; hence they are sometimes called Wang dominoes. A suitable set of Wang dominoes can tile the plane, but only aperiodically. This is known because any Turing machine can be represented as a set of Wang dominoes that tile the plane if and only if the Turing machine does not halt. Since the halting problem is undecidable, the problem of deciding whether a Wang domino set can tile the plane is also undecidable.\n\nTruchet tiles are square tiles decorated with patterns so they do not have rotational symmetry; in 1704, Sébastien Truchet used a square tile split into two triangles of contrasting colours. These can tile the plane either periodically or randomly.\n\nSometimes the colour of a tile is understood as part of the tiling; at other times arbitrary colours may be applied later. When discussing a tiling that is displayed in colours, to avoid ambiguity one needs to specify whether the colours are part of the tiling or just part of its illustration. This affects whether tiles with the same shape but different colours are considered identical, which in turn affects questions of symmetry. The four colour theorem states that for every tessellation of a normal Euclidean plane, with a set of four available colours, each tile can be coloured in one colour such that no tiles of equal colour meet at a curve of positive length. The colouring guaranteed by the four colour theorem does not generally respect the symmetries of the tessellation. To produce a colouring which does, it is necessary to treat the colours as part of the tessellation. Here, as many as seven colours may be needed, as in the picture at right.\n\nNext to the various tilings by regular polygons, tilings by other polygons have also been studied.\n\nAny triangle or quadrilateral (even non-convex) can be used as a prototile to form a monohedral tessellation, often in more than one way. Copies of an arbitrary quadrilateral can form a tessellation with translational symmetry and 2-fold rotational symmetry with centres at the midpoints of all sides. For an asymmetric quadrilateral this tiling belongs to wallpaper group p2. As fundamental domain we have the quadrilateral. Equivalently, we can construct a parallelogram subtended by a minimal set of translation vectors, starting from a rotational centre. We can divide this by one diagonal, and take one half (a triangle) as fundamental domain. Such a triangle has the same area as the quadrilateral and can be constructed from it by cutting and pasting.\n\nIf only one shape of tile is allowed, tilings exists with convex \"N\"-gons for \"N\" equal to 3, 4, 5 and 6. For , see Pentagonal tiling, for , see Hexagonal tiling,for , see Heptagonal tiling and for , see octagonal tiling.\n\nFor results on tiling the plane with polyominoes, see Polyomino § Uses of polyominoes.\n\nVoronoi or Dirichlet tilings are tessellations where each tile is defined as the set of points closest to one of the points in a discrete set of defining points. (Think of geographical regions where each region is defined as all the points closest to a given city or post office.) The \"Voronoi cell\" for each defining point is a convex polygon. The Delaunay triangulation is a tessellation that is the dual graph of a Voronoi tessellation. Delaunay triangulations are useful in numerical simulation, in part because among all possible triangulations of the defining points, Delaunay triangulations maximize the minimum of the angles formed by the edges. Voronoi tilings with randomly placed points can be used to construct random tilings of the plane.\n\nTessellation can be extended to three dimensions. Certain polyhedra can be stacked in a regular crystal pattern to fill (or tile) three-dimensional space, including the cube (the only Platonic polyhedron to do so), the rhombic dodecahedron, the truncated octahedron, and triangular, quadrilateral, and hexagonal prisms, among others. Any polyhedron that fits this criterion is known as a plesiohedron, and may possess between 4 and 38 faces. Naturally occurring rhombic dodecahedra are found as crystals of andradite (a kind of garnet) and fluorite.\n\nA Schwarz triangle is a spherical triangle that can be used to tile a sphere.\n\nTessellations in three or more dimensions are called honeycombs. In three dimensions there is just one regular honeycomb, which has eight cubes at each polyhedron vertex. Similarly, in three dimensions there is just one quasiregular honeycomb, which has eight tetrahedra and six octahedra at each polyhedron vertex. However, there are many possible semiregular honeycombs in three dimensions. Uniform polyhedra can be constructed using the Wythoff construction.\n\nThe Schmitt-Conway biprism is a convex polyhedron with the property of tiling space only aperiodically.\n\nIt is possible to tessellate in non-Euclidean geometries such as hyperbolic geometry. A uniform tiling in the hyperbolic plane (which may be regular, quasiregular or semiregular) is an edge-to-edge filling of the hyperbolic plane, with regular polygons as faces; these are vertex-transitive (transitive on its vertices), and isogonal (there is an isometry mapping any vertex onto any other).\n\nA uniform honeycomb in hyperbolic space is a uniform tessellation of uniform polyhedral cells. In 3-dimensional hyperbolic space there are nine Coxeter group families of compact convex uniform honeycombs, generated as Wythoff constructions, and represented by permutations of rings of the Coxeter diagrams for each family.\n\nIn architecture, tessellations have been used to create decorative motifs since ancient times. Mosaic tilings often had geometric patterns. Later civilisations also used larger tiles, either plain or individually decorated. Some of the most decorative were the Moorish wall tilings of Islamic architecture, using Girih and Zellige tiles in buildings such as the Alhambra and La Mezquita.\n\nTessellations frequently appeared in the graphic art of M. C. Escher; he was inspired by the Moorish use of symmetry in places such as the Alhambra when he visited Spain in 1936. Escher made four \"Circle Limit\" drawings of tilings that use hyperbolic geometry. For his woodcut \"Circle Limit IV\" (1960), Escher prepared a pencil and ink study showing the required geometry. Escher explained that \"No single component of all the series, which from infinitely far away rise like rockets perpendicularly from the limit and are at last lost in it, ever reaches the boundary line.\"\n\nTessellated designs often appear on textiles, whether woven, stitched in or printed. Tessellation patterns have been used to design interlocking motifs of patch shapes in quilts.\n\nTessellations are also a main genre in origami (paper folding), where pleats are used to connect molecules such as twist folds together in a repeating fashion.\n\nTessellation is used in manufacturing industry to reduce the wastage of material (yield losses) such as sheet metal when cutting out shapes for objects like car doors or drinks cans.\n\nTessellation is apparent in the mudcrack-like cracking of thin films – with a degree of self-organisation being observed using micro and nanotechnologies.\n\nThe honeycomb provides a well-known example of tessellation in nature with its hexagonal cells.\n\nIn botany, the term \"tessellate\" describes a checkered pattern, for example on a flower petal, tree bark, or fruit. Flowers including the fritillary and some species of \"Colchicum\" are characteristically tessellate.\n\nMany patterns in nature are formed by cracks in sheets of materials. These patterns can be described by Gilbert tessellations, also known as random crack networks. The Gilbert tessellation is a mathematical model for the formation of mudcracks, needle-like crystals, and similar structures. The model, named after Edgar Gilbert, allows cracks to form starting from randomly scattered over the plane; each crack propagates in two opposite directions along a line through the initiation point, its slope chosen at random, creating a tessellation of irregular convex polygons. Basaltic lava flows often display columnar jointing as a result of contraction forces causing cracks as the lava cools. The extensive crack networks that develop often produce hexagonal columns of lava. One example of such an array of columns is the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. Tessellated pavement, a characteristic example of which is found at Eaglehawk Neck on the Tasman Peninsula of Tasmania, is a rare sedimentary rock formation where the rock has fractured into rectangular blocks.\n\nOther natural patterns occur in foams; these are packed according to Plateau's laws, which require minimal surfaces. Such foams present a problem in how to pack cells as tightly as possible: in 1887, Lord Kelvin proposed a packing using only one solid, the bitruncated cubic honeycomb with very slightly curved faces. In 1993, Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan proposed the Weaire–Phelan structure, which uses less surface area to separate cells of equal volume than Kelvin's foam.\n\nTessellations have given rise to many types of tiling puzzle, from traditional jigsaw puzzles (with irregular pieces of wood or cardboard) and the tangram to more modern puzzles which often have a mathematical basis. For example, polyiamonds and polyominoes are figures of regular triangles and squares, often used in tiling puzzles. Authors such as Henry Dudeney and Martin Gardner have made many uses of tessellation in recreational mathematics. For example, Dudeney invented the hinged dissection, while Gardner wrote about the rep-tile, a shape that can be dissected into smaller copies of the same shape. Inspired by Gardner's articles in Scientific American, the amateur mathematician Marjorie Rice found four new tessellations with pentagons. Squaring the square is the problem of tiling an integral square (one whose sides have integer length) using only other integral squares. An extension is squaring the plane, tiling it by squares whose sizes are all natural numbers without repetitions; James and Frederick Henle proved that this was possible.\n\n\n"}

The mosaic shows the story in the biblical Book of Genesis of the parting of Abraham from his nephew, Lot, as they choose opposing paths. Abraham (on the left) with Isaac and the rest of his family, chooses the road to Canaan, \nas God intends him to, and Lot chooses to take his followers to Sodom.\n\nThe work is a tessera mosaic, tessera describing the material making up the surface of the work. Most tessera works during this time would be made up of small pieces of limestone or marble, cut to shape, and arranged by the artist.\nThe artist uses several conventions of the time. The grouping of the characters is varied, meant to create the illusion of space. This \"shorthand\" way of depicting a crowd is sometimes called a \"head cluster\". There is a hieratic abandonment of consistent and realistic proportions and scale, allowing the artist to put emphasis on the characters of his choosing using attributes like size. The main characters we are intended to focus on are made extremely clear through this method, and the picture itself becomes less illustrative and more symbolic. Eventually this style comes to a refined maturity during the Middle Ages. The move towards completely two-dimensional representative images has already started, and although this mosaic implements the use of lights and darks, with shadows corresponding to the figures, there is a good indication as to what direction religious art is heading.\n"}

The victim is kneeling beside a mass grave already containing many bodies; behind a crowd of SS and Reich Labour Service men watch.\n\nThe photograph dates from some time between mid-1941, when the Germans occupied the oblast (region) of Vinnytsia, and 1943. During this period there were numerous massacres of Jews in the oblast, including in the town itself on 16 and 22 September 1941 and April 1942, after which those spared were sent to labour camps and the Yerusalimka quarter largely razed.\n\nThe photograph was circulated in 1961 by United Press (UP) during the trial of Adolf Eichmann. UP had received it from Al Moss (b.1910) a Polish Jew who acquired it in May 1945 shortly after he was liberated from Allach concentration camp by the American 3rd Army. Moss, living in Chicago in 1961, wanted people \"to know what went on in Eichmann's time\". The UP copy was published over a full page of \"The Forward\".\n\nSome later sources say that the original physical image was in an \"Einsatzgruppe\" member's photograph album, or removed from the pocket of a dead soldier; and that written on its reverse side was \"Last Jew in Vinnitsa\", now sometimes used as the image's name.\n\nThe photograph has become iconic.

{"id": "36885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36885", "title": "Tristan Tzara", "text": "Tristan Tzara\n\nTristan Tzara (; ; born Samuel or Samy Rosenstock, also known as S. Samyro; – 25 December 1963) was a Romanian and French avant-garde poet, essayist and performance artist. Also active as a journalist, playwright, literary and art critic, composer and film director, he was known best for being one of the founders and central figures of the anti-establishment Dada movement. Under the influence of Adrian Maniu, the adolescent Tzara became interested in Symbolism and co-founded the magazine \"Simbolul\" with Ion Vinea (with whom he also wrote experimental poetry) and painter Marcel Janco. During World War I, after briefly collaborating on Vinea's \"Chemarea\", he joined Janco in Switzerland. There, Tzara's shows at the Cabaret Voltaire and Zunfthaus zur Waag, as well as his poetry and art manifestos, became a main feature of early Dadaism. His work represented Dada's nihilistic side, in contrast with the more moderate approach favored by Hugo Ball.\n\nAfter moving to Paris in 1919, Tzara, by then one of the \"presidents of Dada\", joined the staff of \"Littérature\" magazine, which marked the first step in the movement's evolution toward Surrealism. He was involved in the major polemics which led to Dada's split, defending his principles against André Breton and Francis Picabia, and, in Romania, against the eclectic modernism of Vinea and Janco. This personal vision on art defined his Dadaist plays \"The Gas Heart\" (1921) and \"Handkerchief of Clouds\" (1924). A forerunner of automatist techniques, Tzara eventually aligned himself with Breton's Surrealism, and under its influence wrote his celebrated utopian poem \"The Approximate Man\".\n\nDuring the final part of his career, Tzara combined his humanist and anti-fascist perspective with a communist vision, joining the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War and the French Resistance during World War II, and serving a term in the National Assembly. Having spoken in favor of liberalization in the People's Republic of Hungary just before the Revolution of 1956, he distanced himself from the French Communist Party, of which he was by then a member. In 1960, he was among the intellectuals who protested against French actions in the Algerian War.\n\nTristan Tzara was an influential author and performer, whose contribution is credited with having created a connection from Cubism and Futurism to the Beat Generation, Situationism and various currents in rock music. The friend and collaborator of many modernist figures, he was the lover of dancer Maja Kruscek in his early youth and was later married to Swedish artist and poet Greta Knutson.\n\n\"S. Samyro\", a partial anagram of \"Samy Rosenstock\", was used by Tzara from his debut and throughout the early 1910s. A number of undated writings, which he probably authored as early as 1913, bear the signature \"Tristan Ruia\", and, in summer of 1915, he was signing his pieces with the name \"Tristan\".\n\nIn the 1960s, Rosenstock's collaborator and later rival Ion Vinea claimed that he was responsible for coining the \"Tzara\" part of his pseudonym in 1915. Vinea also stated that Tzara wanted to keep \"Tristan\" as his adopted first name, and that this choice had later attracted him the \"infamous pun\" \"Triste Âne Tzara\" (French for \"Sad Donkey Tzara\"). This version of events is uncertain, as manuscripts show that the writer may have already been using the full name, as well as the variations \"Tristan Țara\" and \"Tr. Tzara\", in 1913-1914 (although there is a possibility that he was signing his texts long after committing them to paper).\n\nIn 1972, art historian Serge Fauchereau, based on information received from Colomba, the wife of avant-garde poet Ilarie Voronca, recounted that Tzara himself had explained his chosen name was a pun in Romanian, \"trist în țară\", meaning \"sad in the country\"; Colomba Voronca was also dismissing rumors that Tzara had selected \"Tristan\" as a tribute to poet Tristan Corbière or to Richard Wagner's \"Tristan und Isolde\" opera. Samy Rosenstock legally adopted his new name in 1925, after filing a request with Romania's Ministry of the Interior. The French pronunciation of his name has become commonplace in Romania, where it replaces its more natural reading as \"țara\" (\"the land\", ).\n\nTzara was born in Moinești, Bacău County, in the historical region of Western Moldavia. His parents were Jewish Romanians who reportedly spoke Yiddish as their first language; his father Filip and grandfather Ilie were entrepreneurs in the forestry business. Tzara's mother was Emilia Rosenstock, \"née\" Zibalis. Owing to the Romanian Kingdom's discrimination laws, the Rosenstocks were not emancipated, and thus Tzara was not a full citizen of the country until after 1918.\n\nHe moved to Bucharest at the age of 11, and attended the Schemitz-Tierin boarding school. It is believed that the young Tzara completed his secondary education at a state-run high school, which is identified as the Saint Sava National College or as the Sfântul Gheorghe High School. In October 1912, when Tzara was aged 16, he joined his friends Vinea and Marcel Janco in editing \"Simbolul\". Reputedly, Janco and Vinea provided the funds. Like Vinea, Tzara was also close to their young colleague Jacques G. Costin, who was later his self-declared promoter and admirer.\n\nDespite their young age, the three editors were able to attract collaborations from established Symbolist authors, active within Romania's own Symbolist movement. Alongside their close friend and mentor Adrian Maniu (an Imagist who had been Vinea's tutor), they included N. Davidescu, Alfred Hefter-Hidalgo, Emil Isac, Claudia Millian, Ion Minulescu, I. M. Rașcu, Eugeniu Sperantia, Al. T. Stamatiad, Eugeniu Ștefănescu-Est, Constantin T. Stoika, as well as the journalist and lawyer Poldi Chapier. In its inaugural issue, the journal even printed a poem by one of the leading figures in Romanian Symbolism, Alexandru Macedonski. \"Simbolul\" also featured illustrations by Maniu, Millian and Iosif Iser.\nAlthough the magazine ceased print in December 1912, it played an important part in shaping Romanian literature of the period. Literary historian Paul Cernat sees \"Simbolul\" as a main stage in Romania's modernism, and credits it with having brought about the first changes from Symbolism to the radical avant-garde. Also according to Cernat, the collaboration between Samyro, Vinea and Janco was an early instance of literature becoming \"an interface between arts\", which had for its contemporary equivalent the collaboration between Iser and writers such as Ion Minulescu and Tudor Arghezi. Although Maniu parted with the group and sought a change in style which brought him closer to traditionalist tenets, Tzara, Janco and Vinea continued their collaboration. Between 1913 and 1915, they were frequently vacationing together, either on the Black Sea coast or at the Rosenstock family property in Gârceni, Vaslui County; during this time, Vinea and Samyro wrote poems with similar themes and alluding to one another.\n\nTzara's career changed course between 1914 and 1916, during a period when the Romanian Kingdom kept out of World War I. In autumn 1915, as founder and editor of the short-lived journal \"Chemarea\", Vinea published two poems by his friend, the first printed works to bear the signature \"Tristan Tzara\". At the time, the young poet and many of his friends were adherents of an anti-war and anti-nationalist current, which progressively accommodated anti-establishment messages. \"Chemarea\", which was a platform for this agenda and again attracted collaborations from Chapier, may also have been financed by Tzara and Vinea. According to Romanian avant-garde writer Claude Sernet, the journal was \"totally different from everything that had been printed in Romania before that moment.\" During the period, Tzara's works were sporadically published in Hefter-Hidalgo's \"Versuri și Proză\", and, in June 1915, Constantin Rădulescu-Motru's \"Noua Revistă Română\" published Samyro's known poem \"Verișoară, fată de pension\" (\"Little Cousin, Boarding School Girl\").\n\nTzara had enrolled at the University of Bucharest in 1914, studying mathematics and philosophy, but did not graduate. In autumn 1915, he left Romania for Zürich, in neutral Switzerland. Janco, together with his brother Jules, had settled there a few months before, and was later joined by his other brother Georges. Tzara, who may have applied for the Faculty of Philosophy at the local university, shared lodging with Marcel Janco, who was a student at the \"Technische Hochschule\", in the Altinger Guest House (by 1918, Tzara had moved to the Limmatquai Hotel). His departure from Romania, like that of the Janco brothers, may have been in part a pacifist political statement. After settling in Switzerland, the young poet almost completely discarded Romanian as his language of expression, writing most of his subsequent works in French. The poems he had written before, which were the result of poetic dialogues between him and his friend, were left in Vinea's care. Most of these pieces were first printed only in the interwar period.\n\nIt was in Zürich that the Romanian group met with the German Hugo Ball, an anarchist poet and pianist, and his young wife Emmy Hennings, a music hall performer. In February 1916, Ball had rented the Cabaret Voltaire from its owner, Jan Ephraim, and intended to use the venue for performance art and exhibits. Hugo Ball recorded this period, noting that Tzara and Marcel Janco, like Hans Arp, Arthur Segal, Otto van Rees, Max Oppenheimer, and Marcel Słodki, \"readily agreed to take part in the cabaret.\" According to Ball, among the performances of songs mimicking or taking inspiration from various national folklores, \"Herr Tristan Tzara recited Rumanian poetry.\" In late March, Ball recounted, the group was joined by German writer and drummer Richard Huelsenbeck. He was soon after involved in Tzara's \"simultaneist verse\" performance, \"the first in Zürich and in the world\", also including renditions of poems by two promoters of Cubism, Fernand Divoire and Henri Barzun.\n\nIt was in this milieu that Dada was born, at some point before May 1916, when a publication of the same name first saw print. The story of its establishment was the subject of a disagreement between Tzara and his fellow writers. Cernat believes that the first Dadaist performance took place as early as February, when the nineteen-year-old Tzara, wearing a monocle, entered the Cabaret Voltaire stage singing sentimental melodies and handing paper wads to his \"scandalized spectators\", leaving the stage to allow room for masked actors on stilts, and returning in clown attire. The same type of performances took place at the Zunfthaus zur Waag beginning in summer 1916, after the Cabaret Voltaire was forced to close down. According to music historian Bernard Gendron, for as long as it lasted, \"the Cabaret Voltaire was dada. There was no alternative institution or site that could disentangle 'pure' dada from its mere accompaniment [...] nor was any such site desired.\" Other opinions link Dada's beginnings with much earlier events, including the experiments of Alfred Jarry, André Gide, Christian Morgenstern, Jean-Pierre Brisset, Guillaume Apollinaire, Jacques Vaché, Marcel Duchamp or Francis Picabia.\n\nIn the first of the movement's manifestos, Ball wrote: \"[The booklet] is intended to present to the Public the activities and interests of the Cabaret Voltaire, which has as its sole purpose to draw attention, across the barriers of war and nationalism, to the few independent spirits who live for other ideals. The next objective of the artists who are assembled here is to publish a \"revue internationale\" [French for \"international magazine\"].\" Ball completed his message in French, and the paragraph translates as: \"The magazine shall be published in Zürich and shall carry the name 'Dada' ('Dada'). Dada Dada Dada Dada.\" The view according to which Ball had created the movement was notably supported by writer Walter Serner, who directly accused Tzara of having abused Ball's initiative.\n\nA secondary point of contention between the founders of Dada regarded the paternity for the movement's name, which, according to visual artist and essayist Hans Richter, was first adopted in print in June 1916. Ball, who claimed authorship and stated that he picked the word randomly from a dictionary, indicated that it stood for both the French-language equivalent of \"hobby horse\" and a German-language term reflecting the joy of children being rocked to sleep. Tzara himself declined interest in the matter, but Marcel Janco credited him with having coined the term. Dada manifestos, written or co-authored by Tzara, record that the name shares its form with various other terms, including a word used in the Kru languages of West Africa to designate the tail of a sacred cow; a toy and the name for \"mother\" in an unspecified Italian dialect; and the double affirmative in Romanian and in various Slavic languages.\n\nBefore the end of the war, Tzara had assumed a position as Dada's main promoter and manager, helping the Swiss group establish branches in other European countries. This period also saw the first conflict within the group: citing irreconcilable differences with Tzara, Ball left the group. With his departure, Gendron argues, Tzara was able to move Dada vaudeville-like performances into more of \"an incendiary and yet jocularly provocative theater.\"\n\nHe is often credited with having inspired many young modernist authors from outside Switzerland to affiliate with the group, in particular the Frenchmen Louis Aragon, André Breton, Paul Éluard, Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes and Philippe Soupault. Richter, who also came into contact with Dada at this stage in its history, notes that these intellectuals often had a \"very cool and distant attitude to this new movement\" before being approached by the Romanian author. In June 1916, he began editing and managing the periodical \"Dada\" as a successor of the short-lived magazine \"Cabaret Voltaire\"—Richter describes his \"energy, passion and talent for the job\", which he claims satisfied all Dadaists. He was at the time the lover of Maja Kruscek, who was a student of Rudolf Laban; in Richter's account, their relationship was always tottering.\n\nAs early as 1916, Tristan Tzara took distance from the Italian Futurists, rejecting the militarist and proto-fascist stance of their leader Filippo Tommaso Marinetti. Richter notes that, by then, Dada had replaced Futurism as the leader of modernism, while continuing to build on its influence: \"we had swallowed Futurism—bones, feathers and all. It is true that in the process of digestion all sorts of bones and feathers had been regurgitated.\" Despite this and the fact that Dada did not make any gains in Italy, Tzara could count poets Giuseppe Ungaretti and Alberto Savinio, painters Gino Cantarelli and Aldo Fiozzi, as well as a few other Italian Futurists, among the Dadaists. Among the Italian authors supporting Dadaist manifestos and rallying with the Dada group was the poet, painter and in the future a fascist racial theorist Julius Evola, who became a personal friend of Tzara.\n\nThe next year, Tzara and Ball opened the \"Galerie Dada\" permanent exhibit, through which they set contacts with the independent Italian visual artist Giorgio de Chirico and with the German Expressionist journal \"Der Sturm\", all of whom were described as \"fathers of Dada\". During the same months, and probably owing to Tzara's intervention, the Dada group organized a performance of \"Sphinx and Strawman\", a puppet play by the Austro-Hungarian Expressionist Oskar Kokoschka, whom he advertised as an example of \"Dada theater\". He was also in touch with \"Nord-Sud\", the magazine of French poet Pierre Reverdy (who sought to unify all avant-garde trends), and contributed articles on African art to both \"Nord-Sud\" and Pierre Albert-Birot's \"SIC\" magazine. In early 1918, through Huelsenbeck, Zürich Dadaists established contacts with their more explicitly left-wing disciples in the German Empire—George Grosz, John Heartfield, Johannes Baader, Kurt Schwitters, Walter Mehring, Raoul Hausmann, Carl Einstein, Franz Jung, and Heartfield's brother Wieland Herzfelde. With Breton, Soupault and Aragon, Tzara traveled Cologne, where he became familiarized with the elaborate collage works of Schwitters and Max Ernst, which he showed to his colleagues in Switzerland. Huelsenbeck nonetheless declined to Schwitters membership in Berlin Dada.\n\nAs a result of his campaigning, Tzara created a list of so-called \"Dada presidents\", who represented various regions of Europe. According to Hans Richter, it included, alongside Tzara himself, figures ranging from Ernst, Arp, Baader, Breton and Aragon to Kruscek, Evola, Rafael Lasso de la Vega, Igor Stravinsky, Vicente Huidobro, Francesco Meriano and Théodore Fraenkel. Richter notes: \"I'm not sure if all the names who appear here would agree with the description.\"\n\nThe shows Tzara staged in Zürich often turned into scandals or riots, and he was in permanent conflict with the Swiss law enforcers. Hans Richter speaks of a \"pleasure of letting fly at the bourgeois, which in Tristan Tzara took the form of coldly (or hotly) calculated insolence\" (\"see Épater la bourgeoisie\"). In one instance, as part of a series of events in which Dadaists mocked established authors, Tzara and Arp falsely publicized that they were going to fight a duel in Rehalp, near Zürich, and that they were going to have the popular novelist Jakob Christoph Heer for their witness. Richter also reports that his Romanian colleague profited from Swiss neutrality to play the Allies and Central Powers against each other, obtaining art works and funds from both, making use of their need to stimulate their respective propaganda efforts. While active as a promoter, Tzara also published his first volume of collected poetry, the 1918 \"Vingt-cinq poèmes\" (\"Twenty-five Poems\").\n\nA major event took place in autumn 1918, when Francis Picabia, who was then publisher of \"391\" magazine and a distant Dada affiliate, visited Zürich and introduced his colleagues there to his nihilistic views on art and reason. In the United States, Picabia, Man Ray and Marcel Duchamp had earlier set up their own version of Dada. This circle, based in New York City, sought affiliation with Tzara's only in 1921, when they jokingly asked him to grant them permission to use \"Dada\" as their own name (to which Tzara replied: \"Dada belongs to everybody\"). The visit was credited by Richter with boosting the Romanian author's status, but also with making Tzara himself \"switch suddenly from a position of balance between art and anti-art into the stratospheric regions of pure and joyful nothingness.\" The movement subsequently organized its last major Swiss show, held at the Saal zur Kaufleutern, with choreography by Susanne Perrottet, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, and with the participation of Käthe Wulff, Hans Heusser, Tzara, Hans Richter and Walter Serner. It was there that Serner read from his 1918 essay, whose very title advocated \"Letzte Lockerung\" (\"Final Dissolution\"): this part is believed to have caused the subsequent mêlée, during which the public attacked the performers and succeeded in interrupting, but not canceling, the show.\n\nFollowing the November 1918 Armistice with Germany, Dada's evolution was marked by political developments. In October 1919, Tzara, Arp and Otto Flake began publishing \"Der Zeltweg\", a journal aimed at further popularizing Dada in a post-war world were the borders were again accessible. Richter, who admits that the magazine was \"rather tame\", also notes that Tzara and his colleagues were dealing with the impact of communist revolutions, in particular the October Revolution and the German revolts of 1918, which \"had stirred men's minds, divided men's interests and diverted energies in the direction of political change.\" The same commentator however dismisses those accounts which, he believes, led readers to believe that \"Der Zeltweg\" was \"an association of revolutionary artists.\" According to one account rendered by historian Robert Levy, Tzara shared company with a group of Romanian communist students, and, as such, may have met with Ana Pauker, who was later one of the Romanian Communist Party's most prominent activists.\n\nArp and Janco drifted away from the movement ca. 1919, when they created the Constructivist-inspired workshop \"Das Neue Leben\". In Romania, Dada was awarded an ambiguous reception from Tzara's former associate Vinea. Although he was sympathetic to its goals, treasured Hugo Ball and Hennings and promised to adapt his own writings to its requirements, Vinea cautioned Tzara and the Jancos in favor of lucidity. When Vinea submitted his poem \"Doleanțe\" (\"Grievances\") to be published by Tzara and his associates, he was turned down, an incident which critics attribute to a contrast between the reserved tone of the piece and the revolutionary tenets of Dada.\n\nIn late 1919, Tristan Tzara left Switzerland to join Breton, Soupault and Claude Rivière in editing the Paris-based magazine \"Littérature\". Already a mentor for the French avant-garde, he was, according to Hans Richter, perceived as an \"Anti-Messiah\" and a \"prophet\". Reportedly, Dada mythology had it that he entered the French capital in a snow-white or lilac-colored car, passing down Boulevard Raspail through a triumphal arch made from his own pamphlets, being greeted by cheering crowds and a fireworks display. Richter dismisses this account, indicating that Tzara actually walked from Gare de l'Est to Picabia's home, without anyone expecting him to arrive.\n\nHe is often described as the main figure in the \"Littérature\" circle, and credited with having more firmly set its artistic principles in the line of Dada. When Picabia began publishing a new series of \"391\" in Paris, Tzara seconded him and, Richter says, produced issues of the magazine \"decked out [...] in all the colors of Dada.\" He was also issuing his \"Dada\" magazine, printed in Paris but using the same format, renaming it \"Bulletin Dada\" and later \"Dadaphone\". At around that time, he met American author Gertrude Stein, who wrote about him in \"The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas\", and the artist couple Robert and Sonia Delaunay (with whom he worked in tandem for \"poem-dresses\" and other simultaneist literary pieces).\n\nTzara became involved in a number of Dada experiments, on which he collaborated with Breton, Aragon, Soupault, Picabia or Paul Éluard. Other authors who came into contact with Dada at that stage were Jean Cocteau, Paul Dermée and Raymond Radiguet. The performances staged by Dada were often meant to popularize its principles, and Dada continued to draw attention on itself by hoaxes and false advertising, announcing that the Hollywood film star Charlie Chaplin was going to appear on stage at its show, or that its members were going to have their heads shaved or their hair cut off on stage. In another instance, Tzara and his associates lectured at the \"Université populaire\" in front of industrial workers, who were reportedly less than impressed. Richter believes that, ideologically, Tzara was still in tribute to Picabia's nihilistic and anarchic views (which made the Dadaists attack all political and cultural ideologies), but that this also implied a measure of sympathy for the working class.\n\nDada activities in Paris culminated in the March 1920 variety show at the Théâtre de l'Œuvre, which featured readings from Breton, Picabia, Dermée and Tzara's earlier work, \"La Première aventure céleste de M. Antipyrine\" (\"The First Heavenly Adventure of Mr. Antipyrine\"). Tzara's melody, \"Vaseline symphonique\" (\"Symphonic Vaseline\"), which required ten or twenty people to shout \"cra\" and \"cri\" on a rising scale, was also performed. A scandal erupted when Breton read Picabia's \"Manifeste cannibale\" (\"Cannibal Manifesto\"), lashing out at the audience and mocking them, to which they answered by aiming rotten fruit at the stage.\n\nThe Dada phenomenon was only noticed in Romania beginning in 1920, and its overall reception was negative. Traditionalist historian Nicolae Iorga, Symbolist promoter Ovid Densusianu, the more reserved modernists Camil Petrescu and Benjamin Fondane all refused to accept it as a valid artistic manifestation. Although he rallied with tradition, Vinea defended the subversive current in front of more serious criticism, and rejected the widespread rumor that Tzara had acted as an agent of influence for the Central Powers during the war. Eugen Lovinescu, editor of \"Sburătorul\" and one of Vinea's rivals on the modernist scene, acknowledged the influence exercised by Tzara on the younger avant-garde authors, but analyzed his work only briefly, using as an example one of his pre-Dada poems, and depicting him as an advocate of literary \"extremism\".\n\nBy 1921, Tzara had become involved in conflicts with other figures in the movement, whom he claimed had parted with the spirit of Dada. He was targeted by the Berlin-based Dadaists, in particular by Huelsenbeck and Serner, the former of whom was also involved in a conflict with Raoul Hausmann over leadership status. According to Richter, tensions between Breton and Tzara had surfaced in 1920, when Breton first made known his wish to do away with musical performances altogether and alleged that the Romanian was merely repeating himself. The Dada shows themselves were by then such common occurrences that audiences expected to be insulted by the performers.\n\nA more serious crisis occurred in May, when Dada organized a mock trial of Maurice Barrès, whose early affiliation with the Symbolists had been shadowed by his antisemitism and reactionary stance: Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes was the prosecutor, Aragon and Soupault the defense attorneys, with Tzara, Ungaretti, Benjamin Péret and others as witnesses (a mannequin stood in for Barrès). Péret immediately upset Picabia and Tzara by refusing to make the trial an absurd one, and by introducing a political subtext with which Breton nevertheless agreed. In June, Tzara and Picabia clashed with each other, after Tzara expressed an opinion that his former mentor was becoming too radical. During the same season, Breton, Arp, Ernst, Maja Kruschek and Tzara were in Austria, at Imst, where they published their last manifesto as a group, \"Dada au grand air\" (\"Dada in the Open Air\") or \"Der Sängerkrieg in Tirol\" (\"The Battle of the Singers in Tyrol\"). Tzara also visited Czechoslovakia, where he reportedly hoped to gain adherents to his cause.\n\nAlso in 1921, Ion Vinea wrote an article for the Romanian newspaper \"Adevărul\", arguing that the movement had exhausted itself (although, in his letters to Tzara, he continued to ask his friend to return home and spread his message there). After July 1922, Marcel Janco rallied with Vinea in editing \"Contimporanul\", which published some of Tzara's earliest poems but never offered space to any Dadaist manifesto. Reportedly, the conflict between Tzara and Janco had a personal note: Janco later mentioned \"some dramatic quarrels\" between his colleague and him. They avoided each other for the rest of their lives and Tzara even struck out the dedications to Janco from his early poems. Julius Evola also grew disappointed by the movement's total rejection of tradition and began his personal search for an alternative, pursuing a path which later led him to esotericism and fascism.\n\nTzara was openly attacked by Breton in a February 1922 article for \"Le Journal de Peuple\", where the Romanian writer was denounced as \"an impostor\" avid for \"publicity\". In March, Breton initiated the \"Congress for the Determination and Defense of the Modern Spirit\". The French writer used the occasion to strike out Tzara's name from among the Dadaists, citing in his support Dada's Huelsenbeck, Serner, and Christian Schad. Basing his statement on a note supposedly authored by Huelsenbeck, Breton also accused Tzara of opportunism, claiming that he had planned wartime editions of Dada works in such a manner as not to upset actors on the political stage, making sure that German Dadaists were not made available to the public in countries subject to the Supreme War Council. Tzara, who attended the Congress only as a means to subvert it, responded to the accusations the same month, arguing that Huelsenbeck's note was fabricated and that Schad had not been one of the original Dadaists. Rumors reported much later by American writer Brion Gysin had it that Breton's claims also depicted Tzara as an informer for the Prefecture of Police.\n\nIn May 1922, Dada staged its own funeral. According to Hans Richter, the main part of this took place in Weimar, where the Dadaists attended a festival of the Bauhaus art school, during which Tzara proclaimed the elusive nature of his art: \"Dada is useless, like everything else in life. [...] Dada is a virgin microbe which penetrates with the insistence of air into all those spaces that reason has failed to fill with words and conventions.\"\n\nIn \"The Bearded Heart\" manifesto a number of artists backed the marginalization of Breton in support of Tzara. Alongside Cocteau, Arp, Ribemont-Dessaignes, and Éluard, the pro-Tzara faction included Erik Satie, Theo van Doesburg, Serge Charchoune, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Marcel Duchamp, Ossip Zadkine, Jean Metzinger, Ilia Zdanevich, and Man Ray. During an associated soirée, \"Evening of the Bearded Heart\", which began on 6 July 1923, Tzara presented a re-staging of his play \"The Gas Heart\" (which had been first performed two years earlier to howls of derision from its audience), for which Sonia Delaunay designed the costumes. Breton interrupted its performance and reportedly fought with several of his former associates and broke furniture, prompting a theatre riot that only the intervention of the police halted. Dada's vaudeville declined in importance and disappeared altogether after that date.\n\nPicabia took Breton's side against Tzara, and replaced the staff of his \"391\", enlisting collaborations from Clément Pansaers and Ezra Pound. Breton marked the end of Dada in 1924, when he issued the first \"Surrealist Manifesto\". Richter suggests that \"Surrealism devoured and digested Dada.\" Tzara distanced himself from new trend, disagreeing with its methods and, increasingly, with its politics. In 1923, he and a few other former Dadaists collaborated with Richter and the Constructivist artist El Lissitzky on the magazine \"G\", and, the following year, he wrote pieces for the Yugoslav-Slovenian magazine \"Tank\" (edited by Ferdinand Delak).\n\nTzara continued to write, becoming more seriously interested in the theater. In 1924, he published and staged the play \"Handkerchief of Clouds\", which was soon included in the repertoire of Serge Diaghilev's \"Ballets Russes\". He also collected his earlier Dada texts as the \"Seven Dada Manifestos\". Marxist thinker Henri Lefebvre reviewed them enthusiastically; he later became one of the author's friends.\n\nIn Romania, Tzara's work was partly recuperated by \"Contimporanul\", which notably staged public readings of his works during the international art exhibit it organized in 1924, and again during the \"new art demonstration\" of 1925. In parallel, the short-lived magazine \"Integral\", where Ilarie Voronca and Ion Călugăru were the main animators, took significant interest in Tzara's work. In a 1927 interview with the publication, he voiced his opposition to the Surrealist group's adoption of communism, indicating that such politics could only result in a \"new bourgeoisie\" being created, and explaining that he had opted for a personal \"permanent revolution\", which would preserve \"the holiness of the ego\".\n\nIn 1925, Tristan Tzara was in Stockholm, where he married Greta Knutson, with whom he had a son, Christophe (born 1927). A former student of painter André Lhote, she was known for her interest in phenomenology and abstract art. Around the same period, with funds from Knutson's inheritance, Tzara commissioned Austrian architect Adolf Loos, a former representative of the Vienna Secession whom he had met in Zürich, to build him a house in Paris. The rigidly functionalist \"Maison Tristan Tzara\", built in Montmartre, was designed following Tzara's specific requirements and decorated with samples of African art. It was Loos' only major contribution in his Parisian years.\n\nIn 1929, he reconciled with Breton, and sporadically attended the Surrealists' meetings in Paris. The same year, he issued the poetry book \"De nos oiseaux\" (\"Of Our Birds\"). This period saw the publication of \"The Approximate Man\" (1931), alongside the volumes \"L'Arbre des voyageurs\" (\"The Travelers' Tree\", 1930), \"Où boivent les loups\" (\"Where Wolves Drink\", 1932), \"L'Antitête\" (\"The Antihead\", 1933) and \"Grains et issues\" (\"Seed and Bran\", 1935). By then, it was also announced that Tzara had started work on a screenplay. In 1930, he directed and produced a cinematic version of \"Le Cœur à barbe\", starring Breton and other leading Surrealists. Five years later, he signed his name to \"The Testimony against Gertrude Stein\", published by Eugene Jolas's magazine \"transition\" in reply to Stein's memoir \"The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas\", in which he accused his former friend of being a megalomaniac.\n\nThe poet became involved in further developing Surrealist techniques, and, together with Breton and Valentine Hugo, drew one of the better-known examples of \"exquisite corpses\". Tzara also prefaced a 1934 collection of Surrealist poems by his friend René Char, and the following year he and Greta Knutson visited Char in L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue. Tzara's wife was also affiliated with the Surrealist group at around the same time. This association ended when she parted with Tzara late in the 1930s.\n\nAt home, Tzara's works were collected and edited by the Surrealist promoter Sașa Pană, who corresponded with him over several years. The first such edition saw print in 1934, and featured the 1913-1915 poems Tzara had left in Vinea's care. In 1928-1929, Tzara exchanged letters with his friend Jacques G. Costin, a \"Contimporanul\" affiliate who did not share all of Vinea's views on literature, who offered to organize his visit to Romania and asked him to translate his work into French.\n\nAlarmed by the establishment of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, which also signified the end of Berlin's avant-garde, he merged his activities as an art promoter with the cause of anti-fascism, and was close to the French Communist Party (PCF). In 1936, Richter recalled, he published a series of photographs secretly taken by Kurt Schwitters in Hanover, works which documented the destruction of Nazi propaganda by the locals, ration stamp with reduced quantities of food, and other hidden aspects of Hitler's rule. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he briefly left France and joined the Republican forces. Alongside Soviet reporter Ilya Ehrenburg, Tzara visited Madrid, which was besieged by the Nationalists (\"see Siege of Madrid\"). Upon his return, he published the collection of poems \"Midis gagnés\" (\"Conquered Southern Regions\"). Some of them had previously been printed in the brochure \"Les poètes du monde défendent le peuple espagnol\" (\"The Poets of the World Defend the Spanish People\", 1937), which was edited by two prominent authors and activists, Nancy Cunard and the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda. Tzara had also signed Cunard's June 1937 call to intervention against Francisco Franco. Reportedly, he and Nancy Cunard were romantically involved.\n\nAlthough the poet was moving away from Surrealism, his adherence to strict Marxism-Leninism was reportedly questioned by both the PCF and the Soviet Union. Semiotician Philip Beitchman places their attitude in connection with Tzara's own vision of Utopia, which combined communist messages with Freudo-Marxist psychoanalysis and made use of particularly violent imagery. Reportedly, Tzara refused to be enlisted in supporting the party line, maintaining his independence and refusing to take the forefront at public rallies.\n\nHowever, others note that the former Dadaist leader would often show himself a follower of political guidelines. As early as 1934, Tzara, together with Breton, Éluard and communist writer René Crevel, organized an informal trial of independent-minded Surrealist Salvador Dalí, who was at the time a confessed admirer of Hitler, and whose portrait of William Tell had alarmed them because it shared likeness with Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin. Historian Irina Livezeanu notes that Tzara, who agreed with Stalinism and shunned Trotskyism, submitted to the PCF cultural demands during the writers' congress of 1935, even when his friend Crevel committed suicide to protest the adoption of socialist realism. At a later stage, Livezeanu remarks, Tzara reinterpreted Dada and Surrealism as revolutionary currents, and presented them as such to the public. This stance she contrasts with that of Breton, who was more reserved in his attitudes.\n\nDuring World War II, Tzara took refuge from the German occupation forces, moving to the southern areas, controlled by the Vichy regime. On one occasion, the antisemitic and collaborationist publication \"Je Suis Partout\" made his whereabouts known to the Gestapo.\n\nHe was in Marseille in late 1940-early 1941, joining the group of anti-fascist and Jewish refugees who, protected by American diplomat Varian Fry, were seeking to escape Nazi-occupied Europe. Among the people present there were the anti-totalitarian socialist Victor Serge, anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss, playwright Arthur Adamov, philosopher and poet René Daumal, and several prominent Surrealists: Breton, Char, and Benjamin Péret, as well as artists Max Ernst, André Masson, Wifredo Lam, Jacques Hérold, Victor Brauner and Óscar Domínguez. During the months spent together, and before some of them received permission to leave for America, they invented a new card game, on which traditional card imagery was replaced with Surrealist symbols.\n\nSome time after his stay in Marseille, Tzara joined the French Resistance, rallying with the Maquis. A contributor to magazines published by the Resistance, Tzara also took charge of the cultural broadcast for the Free French Forces clandestine radio station. He lived in Aix-en-Provence, then in Souillac, and ultimately in Toulouse. His son Cristophe was at the time a Resistant in northern France, having joined the \"Francs-Tireurs et Partisans\". In Axis-allied and antisemitic Romania (\"see Romania during World War II\"), the regime of Ion Antonescu ordered bookstores not to sell works by Tzara and 44 other Jewish-Romanian authors. In 1942, with the generalization of antisemitic measures, Tzara was also stripped of his Romanian citizenship rights.\n\nIn December 1944, five months after the Liberation of Paris, he was contributing to \"L'Éternelle Revue\", a pro-communist newspaper edited by philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, through which Sartre was publicizing the heroic image of a France united in resistance, as opposed to the perception that it had passively accepted German control. Other contributors included writers Aragon, Char, Éluard, Elsa Triolet, Eugène Guillevic, Raymond Queneau, Francis Ponge, Jacques Prévert and painter Pablo Picasso.\n\nUpon the end of the war and the restoration of French independence, Tzara was naturalized a French citizen. During 1945, under the Provisional Government of the French Republic, he was a representative of the Sud-Ouest region to the National Assembly. According to Livezeanu, he \"helped reclaim the South from the cultural figures who had associated themselves to Vichy [France].\" In April 1946, his early poems, alongside similar pieces by Breton, Éluard, Aragon and Dalí, were the subject of a midnight broadcast on Parisian Radio. In 1947, he became a full member of the PCF (according to some sources, he had been one since 1934).\n\nOver the following decade, Tzara lent his support to political causes. Pursuing his interest in primitivism, he became a critic of the Fourth Republic's colonial policy, and joined his voice to those who supported decolonization. Nevertheless, he was appointed cultural ambassador of the Republic by the Paul Ramadier cabinet. He also participated in the PCF-organized Congress of Writers, but, unlike Éluard and Aragon, again avoided adapting his style to socialist realism.\n\nHe returned to Romania on an official visit in late 1946-early 1947, as part of a tour of the emerging Eastern Bloc during which he also stopped in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. The speeches he and Sașa Pană gave on the occasion, published by \"Orizont\" journal, were noted for condoning official positions of the PCF and the Romanian Communist Party, and are credited by Irina Livezeanu with causing a rift between Tzara and young Romanian avant-gardists such as Victor Brauner and Gherasim Luca (who rejected communism and were alarmed by the Iron Curtain having fallen over Europe). In September of the same year, he was present at the conference of the pro-communist International Union of Students (where he was a guest of the French-based Union of Communist Students, and met with similar organizations from Romania and other countries).\n\nIn 1949-1950, Tzara answered Aragon's call and become active in the international campaign to liberate Nazım Hikmet, a Turkish poet whose 1938 arrest for communist activities had created a \"cause célèbre\" for the pro-Soviet public opinion. Tzara chaired the Committee for the Liberation of Nazım Hikmet, which issued petitions to national governments and commissioned works in honor of Hikmet (including musical pieces by Louis Durey and Serge Nigg). Hikmet was eventually released in July 1950, and publicly thanked Tzara during his subsequent visit to Paris.\n\nHis works of the period include, among others: \"Le Signe de vie\" (\"Sign of Life\", 1946), \"Terre sur terre\" (\"Earth on Earth\", 1946), \"Sans coup férir\" (\"Without a Need to Fight\", 1949), \"De mémoire d'homme\" (\"From a Man's Memory\", 1950), \"Parler seul\" (\"Speaking Alone\", 1950), and \"La Face intérieure\" (\"The Inner Face\", 1953), followed in 1955 by \"À haute flamme\" (\"Flame out Loud\") and \"Le Temps naissant\" (\"The Nascent Time\"), and the 1956 \"Le Fruit permis\" (\"The Permitted Fruit\"). Tzara continued to be an active promoter of modernist culture. Around 1949, having read Irish author Samuel Beckett's manuscript of \"Waiting for Godot\", Tzara facilitated the play's staging by approaching producer Roger Blin. He also translated into French some poems by Hikmet and the Hungarian author Attila József. In 1949, he introduced Picasso to art dealer Heinz Berggruen (thus helping start their lifelong partnership), and, in 1951, wrote the catalog for an exhibit of works by his friend Max Ernst; the text celebrated the artist's \"free use of stimuli\" and \"his discovery of a new kind of humor.\"\n\nIn October 1956, Tzara visited the People's Republic of Hungary, where the government of Imre Nagy was coming into conflict with the Soviet Union. This followed an invitation on the part of Hungarian writer Gyula Illyés, who wanted his colleague to be present at ceremonies marking the rehabilitation of László Rajk (a local communist leader whose prosecution had been ordered by Joseph Stalin). Tzara was receptive of the Hungarians' demand for liberalization, contacted the anti-Stalinist and former Dadaist Lajos Kassák, and deemed the anti-Soviet movement \"revolutionary\". However, unlike much of Hungarian public opinion, the poet did not recommend emancipation from Soviet control, and described the independence demanded by local writers as \"an abstract notion\". The statement he issued, widely quoted in the Hungarian and international press, forced a reaction from the PCF: through Aragon's reply, the party deplored the fact that one of its members was being used in support of \"anti-communist and anti-Soviet campaigns.\"\n\nHis return to France coincided with the outbreak of the Hungarian Revolution, which ended with a Soviet military intervention. On 24 October, Tzara was ordered to a PCF meeting, where activist Laurent Casanova reportedly ordered him to keep silent, which Tzara did. Tzara's apparent dissidence and the crisis he helped provoke within the Communist Party were celebrated by Breton, who had adopted a pro-Hungarian stance, and who defined his friend and rival as \"the first spokesman of the Hungarian demand.\"\n\nHe was thereafter mostly withdrawn from public life, dedicating himself to researching the work of 15th-century poet François Villon, and, like his fellow Surrealist Michel Leiris, to promoting primitive and African art, which he had been collecting for years. In early 1957, Tzara attended a Dada retrospective on the Rive Gauche, which ended in a riot caused by the rival avant-garde Mouvement Jariviste, an outcome which reportedly pleased him. In August 1960, one year after the Fifth Republic had been established by President Charles de Gaulle, French forces were confronting the Algerian rebels (\"see Algerian War\"). Together with Simone de Beauvoir, Marguerite Duras, Jérôme Lindon, Alain Robbe-Grillet and other intellectuals, he addressed Premier Michel Debré a letter of protest, concerning France's refusal to grant Algeria its independence. As a result, Minister of Culture André Malraux announced that his cabinet would not subsidize any films to which Tzara and the others might contribute, and the signatories could no longer appear on stations managed by the state-owned French Broadcasting Service.\n\nIn 1961, as recognition for his work as a poet, Tzara was awarded the prestigious Taormina Prize. One of his final public activities took place in 1962, when he attended the International Congress on African Culture, organized by English curator Frank McEwen and held at the National Gallery in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia. He died one year later in his Paris home, and was buried at the Cimetière du Montparnasse.\n\nMuch critical commentary about Tzara surrounds the measure to which the poet identified with the national cultures which he represented. Paul Cernat notes that the association between Samyro and the Jancos, who were Jews, and their ethnic Romanian colleagues, was one sign of a cultural dialogue, in which \"the openness of Romanian environments toward artistic modernity\" was stimulated by \"young emancipated Jewish writers.\" Salomon Schulman, a Swedish researcher of Yiddish literature, argues that the combined influence of Yiddish folklore and Hasidic philosophy shaped European modernism in general and Tzara's style in particular, while American poet Andrei Codrescu speaks of Tzara as one in a Balkan line of \"absurdist writing\", which also includes the Romanians Urmuz, Eugène Ionesco and Emil Cioran. According to literary historian George Călinescu, Samyro's early poems deal with \"the voluptuousness over the strong scents of rural life, which is typical among Jews compressed into ghettos.\"\n\nTzara himself used elements alluding to his homeland in his early Dadaist performances. His collaboration with Maja Kruscek at Zuntfhaus zür Waag featured samples of African literature, to which Tzara added Romanian-language fragments. He is also known to have mixed elements of Romanian folklore, and to have sung the native suburban romanza \"La moară la Hârța\" (\"At the Mill in Hârța\") during at least one staging for Cabaret Voltaire. Addressing the Romanian public in 1947, he claimed to have been captivated by \"the sweet language of Moldavian peasants\".\n\nTzara nonetheless rebelled against his birthplace and upbringing. His earliest poems depict provincial Moldavia as a desolate and unsettling place. In Cernat's view, this imagery was in common use among Moldavian-born writers who also belonged to the avant-garde trend, notably Benjamin Fondane and George Bacovia. Like in the cases of Eugène Ionesco and Fondane, Cernat proposes, Samyro sought self-exile to Western Europe as a \"modern, voluntarist\" means of breaking with \"the peripheral condition\", which may also serve to explain the pun he selected for a pseudonym. According to the same author, two important elements in this process were \"a maternal attachment and a break with paternal authority\", an \"Oedipus complex\" which he also argued was evident in the biographies of other Symbolist and avant-garde Romanian authors, from Urmuz to Mateiu Caragiale. Unlike Vinea and the \"Contimporanul\" group, Cernat proposes, Tzara stood for radicalism and insurgency, which would also help explain their impossibility to communicate. In particular, Cernat argues, the writer sought to emancipate himself from competing nationalisms, and addressed himself directly to the center of European culture, with Zürich serving as a stage on his way to Paris. The 1916 \"Monsieur's Antipyrine's Manifesto\" featured a cosmopolitan appeal: \"DADA remains within the framework of European weaknesses, it's still shit, but from now on we want to shit in different colors so as to adorn the zoo of art with all the flags of all the consulates.\"\n\nWith time, Tristan Tzara came to be regarded by his Dada associates as an exotic character, whose attitudes were intrinsically linked with Eastern Europe. Early on, Ball referred to him and the Janco brothers as \"Orientals\". Hans Richter believed him to be a fiery and impulsive figure, having little in common with his German collaborators. According to Cernat, Richter's perspective seems to indicate a vision of Tzara having a \"Latin\" temperament. This type of perception also had negative implications for Tzara, particularly after the 1922 split within Dada. In the 1940s, Richard Huelsenbeck alleged that his former colleague had always been separated from other Dadaists by his failure to appreciate the legacy of \"German humanism\", and that, compared to his German colleagues, he was \"a barbarian\". In his polemic with Tzara, Breton also repeatedly placed stress on his rival's foreign origin.\n\nAt home, Tzara was occasionally targeted for his Jewishness, culminating in the ban enforced by the Ion Antonescu regime. In 1931, Const. I. Emilian, the first Romanian to write an academic study on the avant-garde, attacked him from a conservative and antisemitic position. He depicted Dadaists as \"Judaeo-Bolsheviks\" who corrupted Romanian culture, and included Tzara among the main proponents of \"literary anarchism\". Alleging that Tzara's only merit was to establish a literary fashion, while recognizing his \"formal virtuosity and artistic intelligence\", he claimed to prefer Tzara in his \"Simbolul\" stage. This perspective was deplored early on by the modernist critic Perpessicius. Nine years after Emilian's polemic text, fascist poet and journalist Radu Gyr published an article in \"Convorbiri Literare\", in which he attacked Tzara as a representative of the \"Judaic spirit\", of the \"foreign plague\" and of \"materialist-historical dialectics\".\n\nTzara's earliest Symbolist poems, published in \"Simbolul\" during 1912, were later rejected by their author, who asked Sașa Pană not to include them in editions of his works. The influence of French Symbolists on the young Samyro was particularly important, and surfaced in both his lyric and prose poems. Attached to Symbolist musicality at that stage, he was indebted to his \"Simbolul\" colleague Ion Minulescu and the Belgian Maurice Maeterlinck. Philip Beitchman argues that \"Tristan Tzara is one of the writers of the twentieth century who was most profoundly influenced by symbolism—and utilized many of its methods and ideas in the pursuit of his own artistic and social ends.\" However, Cernat believes, the young poet was by then already breaking with the syntax of conventional poetry, and that, in subsequent experimental pieces, he progressively stripped his style of its Symbolist elements.\n\nDuring the 1910s, Samyro experimented with Symbolist imagery, in particular with the \"hanged man\" motif, which served as the basis for his poem \"Se spânzură un om\" (\"A Man Hangs Himself\"), and which built on the legacy of similar pieces authored by Christian Morgenstern and Jules Laforgue. \"Se spânzură un om\" was also in many ways similar to ones authored by his collaborators Adrian Maniu (\"Balada spânzuratului\", \"The Hanged Man's Ballad\") and Vinea (\"Visul spânzuratului\", \"The Hanged Man's Dream\"): all three poets, who were all in the process of discarding Symbolism, interpreted the theme from a tragicomic and iconoclastic perspective. These pieces also include \"Vacanță în provincie\" (\"Provincial Holiday\") and the anti-war fragment \"Furtuna și cântecul dezertorului\" (\"The Storm and the Deserter's Song\"), which Vinea published in his \"Chemarea\". The series is seen by Cernat as \"the general rehearsal for the Dada adventure.\" The complete text of \"Furtuna și cântecul dezertorului\" was published at a later stage, after the missing text was discovered by Pană. At the time, he became interested in the free verse work of the American Walt Whitman, and his translation of Whitman's epic poem \"Song of Myself\", probably completed before World War I, was published by Alfred Hefter-Hidalgo in his magazine \"Versuri și Proză\" (1915).\n\nBeitchman notes that, throughout his life, Tzara used Symbolist elements against the doctrines of Symbolism. Thus, he argues, the poet did not cultivate a memory of historical events, \"since it deludes man into thinking that there was something when there was nothing.\" Cernat notes: \"That which essentially unifies, during [the 1910s], the poetic output of Adrian Maniu, Ion Vinea and Tristan Tzara is an acute awareness of literary conventions, a satiety [...] in respect to calophile literature, which they perceived as exhausted.\" In Beitchman's view, the revolt against cultivated beauty was a constant in Tzara's years of maturity, and his visions of social change continued to be inspired by Arthur Rimbaud and the Comte de Lautréamont. According to Beitchman, Tzara uses the Symbolist message, \"the birthright [of humans] has been sold for a mess of porridge\", taking it \"into the streets, cabarets and trains where he denounces the deal and asks for his birthright back.\"\n\nThe transition to a more radical form of poetry seems to have taken place in 1913-1915, during the periods when Tzara and Vinea were vacationing together. The pieces share a number of characteristics and subjects, and the two poets even use them to allude to one another (or, in one case, to Tzara's sister).\n\nIn addition to the lyrics were they both speak of provincial holidays and love affairs with local girls, both friends intended to reinterpret William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" from a modernist perspective, and wrote incomplete texts with this as their subject. However, Paul Cernat notes, the texts also evidence a difference in approach, with Vinea's work being \"meditative and melancholic\", while Tzara's is \"hedonistic\". Tzara often appealed to revolutionary and ironic images, portraying provincial and middle class environments as places of artificiality and decay, demystifying pastoral themes and evidencing a will to break free. His literature took a more radical perspective on life, and featured lyrics with subversive intent:\nIn his \"Înserează\" (roughly, \"Night Falling\"), probably authored in Mangalia, Tzara writes:\nVinea's similar poem, written in Tuzla and named after that village, reads:\nCernat notes that \"Nocturnă\" (\"Nocturne\") and \"Înserează\" were the pieces originally performed at Cabaret Voltaire, identified by Hugo Ball as \"Rumanian poetry\", and that they were recited in Tzara's own spontaneous French translation. Although they are noted for their radical break with the traditional form of Romanian verse, Ball's diary entry of 5 February 1916, indicates that Tzara's works were still \"conservative in style\". In Călinescu's view, they announce Dadaism, given that \"bypassing the relations which lead to a realistic vision, the poet associates unimaginably dissipated images that will surprise consciousness.\" In 1922, Tzara himself wrote: \"As early as 1914, I tried to strip the words of their proper meaning and use them in such a way as to give the verse a completely new, general, meaning [...].\"\n\nAlongside pieces depicting a Jewish cemetery in which graves \"crawl like worms\" on the edge of a town, chestnut trees \"heavy-laden like people returning from hospitals\", or wind wailing \"with all the hopelessness of an orphanage\", Samyro's poetry includes \"Verișoară, fată de pension\", which, Cernat argues, displays \"playful detachment [for] the musicality of internal rhymes\". It opens with the lyrics:\nThe Gârceni pieces were treasured by the moderate wing of the Romanian avant-garde movement. In contrast to his previous rejection of Dada, \"Contimporanul\" collaborator Benjamin Fondane used them as an example of \"pure poetry\", and compared them to the elaborate writings of French poet Paul Valéry, thus recuperating them in line with the magazine's ideology.\n\nTzara the Dadaist was inspired by the contributions of his experimental modernist predecessors. Among them were the literary promoters of Cubism: in addition to Henri Barzun and Fernand Divoire, Tzara cherished the works of Guillaume Apollinaire. Despite Dada's condemnation of Futurism, various authors note the influence Filippo Tommaso Marinetti and his circle exercised on Tzara's group. In 1917, he was in correspondence with both Apollinaire and Marinetti. Traditionally, Tzara is also seen as indebted to the early avant-garde and black comedy writings of Romania's Urmuz.\n\nFor a large part, Dada focused on performances and satire, with shows that often had Tzara, Marcel Janco and Huelsenbeck for their main protagonists. Often dressed up as Tyrolian peasants or wearing dark robes, they improvised poetry sessions at the Cabaret Voltaire, reciting the works of others or their spontaneous creations, which were or pretended to be in Esperanto or Māori language. Bernard Gendron describes these soirées as marked by \"heterogeneity and eclecticism\", and Richter notes that the songs, often punctuated by loud shrieks or other unsettling sounds, built on the legacy of noise music and Futurist compositions.\n\nWith time, Tristan Tzara merged his performances and his literature, taking part in developing Dada's \"simultaneist poetry\", which was meant to be read out loud and involved a collaborative effort, being, according to Hans Arp, the first instance of Surrealist automatism. Ball stated that the subject of such pieces was \"the value of the human voice.\" Together with Arp, Tzara and Walter Serner produced the German-language \"Die Hyperbel vom Krokodilcoiffeur und dem Spazierstock\" (\"The Hyperbole of the Crocodile's Hairdresser and the Walking-Stick\"), in which, Arp stated, \"the poet crows, curses, sighs, stutters, yodels, as he pleases. His poems are like Nature [where] a tiny particle is as beautiful and important as a star.\" Another noted simultaneist poem was \"L'Amiral cherche une maison à louer\" (\"The Admiral Is Looking for a House to Rent\"), co-authored by Tzara, Marcel Janco and Huelsenbach.\n\nArt historian Roger Cardinal describes Tristan Tzara's Dada poetry as marked by \"extreme semantic and syntactic incoherence\". Tzara, who recommended destroying just as it is created, had devised a personal system for writing poetry, which implied a seemingly chaotic reassembling of words that had been randomly cut out of newspapers.\n\nThe Romanian writer also spent the Dada period issuing a long series of manifestos, which were often authored as prose poetry, and, according to Cardinal, were characterized by \"rumbustious tomfoolery and astringent wit\", which reflected \"the language of a sophisticated savage\". Huelsenbeck credited Tzara with having discovered in them the format for \"compress[ing] what we think and feel\", and, according to Hans Richter, the genre \"suited Tzara perfectly.\" Despite its production of seemingly theoretical works, Richter indicates, Dada lacked any form of program, and Tzara tried to perpetuate this state of affairs. His Dada manifesto of 1918 stated: \"Dada means nothing\", adding \"Thought is produced in the mouth.\" Tzara indicated: \"I am against systems; the most acceptable system is on principle to have none.\" In addition, Tzara, who once stated that \"logic is always false\", probably approved of Serner's vision of a \"final dissolution\". According to Philip Beitchman, a core concept in Tzara's thought was that \"as long as we do things the way we think we once did them we will be unable to achieve any kind of livable society.\"\n\nDespite adopting such anti-artistic principles, Richter argues, Tzara, like many of his fellow Dadaists, did not initially discard the mission of \"furthening the cause of art.\" He saw this evident in \"La Revue Dada 2\", a poem \"as exquisite as freshly-picked flowers\", which included the lyrics:\n\n\"La Revue Dada 2\", which also includes the onomatopoeic line \"tralalalalalalalalalalala\", is one example where Tzara applies his principles of chance to sounds themselves. This sort of arrangement, treasured by many Dadaists, was probably connected with Apollinaire's calligrams, and with his announcement that \"Man is in search of a new language.\" Călinescu proposed that Tzara willingly limited the impact of chance: taking as his example a short parody piece which depicts the love affair between cyclist and a Dadaist, which ends with their decapitation by a jealous husband, the critic notes that Tzara transparently intended to \"shock the bourgeois\". Late in his career, Huelsenbeck alleged that Tzara never actually applied the experimental methods he had devised.\n\nThe Dada series makes ample use of contrast, ellipses, ridiculous imagery and nonsensical verdicts. Tzara was aware that the public could find it difficult to follow his intentions, and, in a piece titled \"Le géant blanc lépreux du paysage\" (\"The White Leprous Giant in the Landscape\") even alluded to the \"skinny, idiotic, dirty\" reader who \"does not understand my poetry.\" He called some of his own poems \"lampisteries\", from a French word designating storage areas for light fixtures. The Lettrist poet Isidore Isou included such pieces in a succession of experiments inaugurated by Charles Baudelaire with the \"destruction of the anecdote for the form of the poem\", a process which, with Tzara, became \"destruction of the word for nothing\". According to American literary historian Mary Ann Caws, Tzara's poems may be seen as having an \"internal order\", and read as \"a simple spectacle, as creation complete in itself and completely obvious.\"\n\nTristan Tzara's first play, \"The Gas Heart\", dates from the final period of Paris Dada. Created with what Enoch Brater calls a \"peculiar verbal strategy\", it is a dialogue between characters called Ear, Mouth, Eye, Nose, Neck, and Eyebrow. They seem unwilling to actually communicate to each other and their reliance on proverbs and idiotisms willingly creates confusion between metaphorical and literal speech. The play ends with a dance performance that recalls similar devices used by the proto-Dadaist Alfred Jarry. The text culminates in a series of doodles and illegible words. Brater describes \"The Gas Heart\" as a \"parod[y] of theatrical conventions\".\n\nIn his 1924 play \"Handkerchief of Clouds\", Tzara explores the relation between perception, the subconscious and memory. Largely through exchanges between commentators who act as third parties, the text presents the tribulations of a love triangle (a poet, a bored woman, and her banker husband, whose character traits borrow the clichés of conventional drama), and in part reproduces settings and lines from \"Hamlet\". Tzara mocks classical theater, which demands from characters to be inspiring, believable, and to function as a whole: \"Handkerchief of Clouds\" requires actors in the role of commentators to address each other by their real names, and their lines include dismissive comments on the play itself, while the protagonist, who in the end dies, is not assigned any name. Writing for \"Integral\", Tzara defined his play as a note on \"the relativity of things, sentiments and events.\" Among the conventions ridiculed by the dramatist, Philip Beitchman notes, is that of a \"privileged position for art\": in what Beitchman sees as a comment on Marxism, poet and banker are interchangeable capitalists who invest in different fields. Writing in 1925, Fondane rendered a pronouncement by Jean Cocteau, who, while commenting that Tzara was one of his \"most beloved\" writers and a \"great poet\", argued: \"\"Handkerchief of Clouds\" was poetry, and great poetry for that matter—but not theater.\" The work was nonetheless praised by Ion Călugăru at \"Integral\", who saw in it one example that modernist performance could rely not just on props, but also on a solid text.\n\nAfter 1929, with the adoption of Surrealism, Tzara's literary works discard much of their satirical purpose, and begin to explore universal themes relating to the human condition. According to Cardinal, the period also signified the definitive move from \"a studied inconsequentiality\" and \"unreadable gibberish\" to \"a seductive and fertile surrealist idiom.\" The critic also remarks: \"Tzara arrived at a mature style of transparent simplicity, in which disparate entities could be held together in a unifying vision.\" In a 1930 essay, Fondane had given a similar verdict: arguing that Tzara had infused his work with \"suffering\", had discovered humanity, and had become a \"clairvoyant\" among poets.\n\nThis period in Tzara's creative activity centers on \"The Approximate Man\", an epic poem which is reportedly recognized as his most accomplished contribution to French literature. While maintaining some of Tzara's preoccupation with language experimentation, it is mainly a study in social alienation and the search for an escape. Cardinal calls the piece \"an extended meditation on mental and elemental impulses [...] with images of stunning beauty\", while Breitchman, who notes Tzara's rebellion against the \"excess baggage of [man's] past and the notions [...] with which he has hitherto tried to control his life\", remarks his portrayal of poets as voices who can prevent human beings from destroying themselves with their own intellects. The goal is a new man who lets intuition and spontaneity guide him through life, and who rejects measure. One of the appeals in the text reads:\nThe next stage in Tzara's career saw a merger of his literary and political views. His poems of the period blend a humanist vision with communist theses. The 1935 \"Grains et issues\", described by Beitchman as \"fascinating\", was a prose poem of social criticism connected with \"The Approximate Man\", expanding on the vision of a possible society, in which haste has been abandoned in favor of oblivion. The world imagined by Tzara abandons symbols of the past, from literature to public transportation and currency, while, like psychologists Sigmund Freud and Wilhelm Reich, the poet depicts violence as a natural means of human expression. People of the future live in a state which combines waking life and the realm of dreams, and life itself turns into revery. \"Grains et issues\" was accompanied by \"Personage d'insomnie\" (\"Personage of Insomnia\"), which went unpublished.\n\nCardinal notes: \"In retrospect, harmony and contact had been Tzara's goals all along.\" The post-World War II volumes in the series focus on political subjects related to the conflict. In his last writings, Tzara toned down experimentation, exercising more control over the lyrical aspects. He was by then undertaking a hermeutic research into the work of Goliards and François Villon, whom he deeply admired.\n\nBeside the many authors who were attracted into Dada through his promotional activities, Tzara was able to influence successive generations of writers. This was the case in his homeland during 1928, when the first avant-garde manifesto issued by \"unu\" magazine, written by Sașa Pană and Moldov, cited as its mentors Tzara, writers Breton, Ribemont-Dessaignes, Vinea, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, and Tudor Arghezi, as well as artists Constantin Brâncuși and Theo van Doesburg. One of the Romanian writers to claim inspiration from Tzara was Jacques G. Costin, who nevertheless offered an equally good reception to both Dadaism and Futurism, while Ilarie Voronca's \"Zodiac\" cycle, first published in France, is traditionally seen as indebted to \"The Approximate Man\". The Kabbalist and Surrealist author Marcel Avramescu, who wrote during the 1930s, also appears to have been directly inspired by Tzara's views on art. Other authors from that generation to have been inspired by Tzara were Polish Futurist writer Bruno Jasieński, Japanese poet and Zen thinker Takahashi Shinkichi, and Chilean poet and Dadaist sympathizer Vicente Huidobro, who cited him as a precursor for his own \"Creacionismo\".\n\nAn immediate precursor of Absurdism, he was acknowledged as a mentor by Eugène Ionesco, who developed on his principles for his early essays of literary and social criticism, as well as in tragic farces such as \"The Bald Soprano\". Tzara's poetry influenced Samuel Beckett (who translated some of it into English); the Irish author's 1972 play \"Not I\" shares some elements with \"The Gas Heart\". In the United States, the Romanian author is cited as an influence on Beat Generation members. Beat writer Allen Ginsberg, who made his acquaintance in Paris, cites him among the Europeans who influenced him and William S. Burroughs. The latter also mentioned Tzara's use of chance in writing poetry as an early example of what became the cut-up technique, adopted by Brion Gysin and Burroughs himself. Gysin, who conversed with Tzara in the late 1950s, records the latter's indignation that Beat poets were \"going back over the ground we [Dadaists] covered in 1920\", and accuses Tzara of having consumed his creative energies into becoming a \"Communist Party bureaucrat\".\n\nAmong the late 20th-century writers who acknowledged Tzara as an inspiration are Jerome Rothenberg, Isidore Isou and Andrei Codrescu. The former Situationist Isou, whose experiments with sounds and poetry come in succession to Apollinaire and Dada, declared his Lettrism to be the last connection in the Charles Baudelaire-Tzara cycle, with the goal of arranging \"a nothing [...] for the creation of the anecdote.\" For a short period, Codrescu even adopted the pen name \"Tristan Tzara\". He recalled the impact of having discovered Tzara's work in his youth, and credited him with being \"the most important French poet after Rimbaud.\"\n\nIn retrospect, various authors describe Tzara's Dadaist shows and street performances as \"happenings\", with a word employed by post-Dadaists and Situationists, which was coined in the 1950s. Some also credit Tzara with having provided an ideological source for the development of rock music, including punk rock, punk subculture and post-punk. Tristan Tzara has inspired the songwriting technique of Radiohead, and is one of the avant-garde authors whose voices were mixed by DJ Spooky on his trip hop album \"Rhythm Science\". Romanian contemporary classical musician Cornel Țăranu set to music five of Tzara's poems, all of which date from the post-Dada period. Țăranu, Anatol Vieru and ten other composers contributed to the album \"La Clé de l'horizon\", inspired by Tzara's work.\n\nIn France, Tzara's work was collected as \"Oeuvres complètes\" (\"Complete Works\"), of which the first volume saw print in 1975, and an international poetry award is named after him (\"Prix International de Poésie Tristan Tzara\"). An international periodical titled \"Caietele Tristan Tzara\", edited by the Tristan Tzara Cultural-Literary Foundation, has been published in Moinești since 1998.\n\nAccording to Paul Cernat, \"Aliluia\", one of the few avant-garde texts authored by Ion Vinea features a \"transparent allusion\" to Tristan Tzara. Vinea's fragment speaks of \"the Wandering Jew\", a character whom people notice because he sings \"La moară la Hârța\", \"a suspicious song from Greater Romania.\" The poet is a character in Indian novelist Mulk Raj Anand's \"Thieves of Fire\", part four of his \"The Bubble\" (1984), as well as in \"The Prince of West End Avenue\", a 1994 book by the American Alan Isler. Rothenberg dedicated several of his poems to Tzara, as did the Neo-Dadaist Valery Oișteanu. Tzara's legacy in literature also covers specific episodes of his biography, beginning with Gertrude Stein's controversial memoir. One of his performances is enthusiastically recorded by Malcolm Cowley in his autobiographical book of 1934, \"Exile's Return\", and he is also mentioned in Harold Loeb's memoir \"The Way It Was\". Among his biographers is the French author François Buot, who records some of the lesser-known aspects of Tzara's life.\n\nAt some point between 1915 and 1917, Tzara is believed to have played chess in a coffeehouse that was also frequented by Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin. While Richter himself recorded the incidental proximity of Lenin's lodging to the Dadaist milieu, no record exists of an actual conversation between the two figures. Andrei Codrescu believes that Lenin and Tzara did play against each other, noting that an image of their encounter would be \"the proper icon of the beginning of [modern] times.\" This meeting is mentioned as a fact in \"Harlequin at the Chessboard\", a poem by Tzara's acquaintance Kurt Schwitters. German playwright and novelist Peter Weiss, who has introduced Tzara as a character in his 1969 play about Leon Trotsky (\"Trotzki im Exil\"), recreated the scene in his 1975-1981 cycle \"The Aesthetics of Resistance\". The imagined episode also inspired much of Tom Stoppard's 1974 play \"Travesties\", which also depicts conversations between Tzara, Lenin, and the Irish modernist author James Joyce (who is also known to have resided in Zürich after 1915). His role was notably played by David Westhead in the 1993 British production, and by Tom Hewitt in the 2005 American version.\n\nAlongside his collaborations with Dada artists on various pieces, Tzara himself was a subject for visual artists. Max Ernst depicts him as the only mobile character in the Dadaists' group portrait \"Au Rendez-vous des Amis\" (\"A Friends' Reunion\", 1922), while, in one of Man Ray's photographs, he is shown kneeling to kiss the hand of an androgynous Nancy Cunard. Years before their split, Francis Picabia used Tzara's calligraphed name in \"Moléculaire\" (\"Molecular\"), a composition printed on the cover of \"391\". The same artist also completed his schematic portrait, which showed a series of circles connected by two perpendicular arrows. In 1949, Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti made Tzara the subject of one of his first experiments with lithography. Portraits of Tzara were also made by Greta Knutson, Robert Delaunay, and the Cubist painters M. H. Maxy and Lajos Tihanyi. As an homage to Tzara the performer, art rocker David Bowie adopted his accessories and mannerisms during a number of public appearances. In 1996, he was depicted on a series of Romanian stamps, and, the same year, a concrete and steel monument dedicated to the writer was erected in Moinești.\n\nSeveral of Tzara's Dadaist editions had illustrations by Picabia, Janco and Hans Arp. In its 1925 edition, \"Handkerchief of Clouds\" featured etchings by Juan Gris, while his late writings \"Parler seul\", \"Le Signe de vie\", \"De mémoire d'homme\", \"Le Temps naissant\", and \"Le Fruit permis\" were illustrated with works by, respectively, Joan Miró, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Nejad Devrim and Sonia Delaunay. Tzara was the subject of a 1949 eponymous documentary film directed by Danish filmmaker Jørgen Roos, and footage of him featured prominently in the 1953 production \"Les statues meurent aussi\" (\"Statues Also Die\"), jointly directed by Chris Marker and Alain Resnais.\n\nThe many polemics which surrounded Tzara in his lifetime left traces after his death, and determine contemporary perceptions of his work. The controversy regarding Tzara's role as a founder of Dada extended into several milieus, and continued long after the writer died. Richter, who discusses the lengthy conflict between Huelsenbeck and Tzara over the issue of Dada foundation, speaks of the movement as being torn apart by \"petty jealousies\". In Romania, similar debates often involved the supposed founding role of Urmuz, who wrote his avant-garde texts before World War I, and Tzara's status as a communicator between Romania and the rest of Europe. Vinea, who claimed that Dada had been invented by Tzara in Gârceni ca. 1915 and thus sought to legitimize his own modernist vision, also saw Urmuz as the ignored precursor of radical modernism, from Dada to Surrealism. In 1931 the young, modernist literary critic Lucian Boz evidenced that he partly shared Vinea's perspective on the matter, crediting Tzara and Constantin Brâncuși with having, each on his own, invented the avant-garde. Eugène Ionesco argued that \"before Dadaism there was Urmuzianism\", and, after World War II, sought to popularize Urmuz's work among aficionados of Dada. Rumors in the literary community had it that Tzara successfully sabotaged Ionesco's initiative to publish a French edition of Urmuz's texts, allegedly because the public could then question his claim to have initiated the avant-garde experiment in Romania and the world (the edition saw print in 1965, two years after Tzara's death).\n\nA more radical questioning of Tzara's influence came from Romanian essayist Petre Pandrea. In his personal diary, published long after he and Tzara had died, Pandrea depicted the poet as an opportunist, accusing him of adapting his style to political requirements, of dodging military service during World War I, and of being a \"Lumpenproletarian\". Pandrea's text, completed just after Tzara's visit to Romania, claimed that his founding role within the avant-garde was an \"illusion [...] which has swelled up like a multicolored balloon\", and denounced him as \"the Balkan provider of interlope odalisques, [together] with narcotics and a sort of scandalous literature.\" Himself an adherent to communism, Pandrea grew disillusioned with the ideology, and later became a political prisoner in Communist Romania. Vinea's own grudge probably shows up in his 1964 novel \"Lunatecii\", where Tzara is identifiable as \"Dr. Barbu\", a thick-hided charlatan.\n\nFrom the 1960s to 1989, after a period when it ignored or attacked the avant-garde movement, the Romanian communist regime sought to recuperate Tzara, in order to validate its newly adopted emphasis on nationalist and national communist tenets. In 1977, literary historian Edgar Papu, whose controversial theories were linked to \"protochronism\", which presumes that Romanians took precedence in various areas of world culture, mentioned Tzara, Urmuz, Ionesco and Isou as representatives of \"Romanian initiatives\" and \"road openers at a universal level.\" Elements of protochronism in this area, Paul Cernat argues, could be traced back to Vinea's claim that his friend had single-handedly created the worldwide avant-garde movement on the basis of models already present at home.\n\n\n"}

It was originally created by Rockwell in 1942 for the 1944 Brown & Bigelow Boy Scout Calendar. The model, Bob Hamilton, won a contest to be in the painting and personally delivered a print to the Vice President of the United States at the time, Henry A. Wallace.\nThe painting was created to encourage Scouts to participate in the war effort during World War II. The name of the painting, \"We, Too, Have a Job to Do\", comes from a slogan that the Boy Scouts of America used in 1942 to rally scouts to support the troops by collecting metal and planting victory gardens.\n\nThe model, Bob Hamilton, won a contest with his local council in Albany, New York, to be depicted in the painting. He traveled to Rockwell's studio in Arlington, Vermont, to model for Rockwell. Since Hamilton was a scout, the uniform shown in the painting was his, unlike some of Rockwell's other models. Originally, he wore a turtle shell neckerchief slide with his uniform that he had made. Rockwell did not like it and asked Hamilton to swap it for a simpler Turk's head slide. In 1944, Hamilton personally delivered a copy of the painting to Vice President Henry A. Wallace. Hamilton later became an Eagle Scout, served in the Navy, and worked for the Boy Scouts. He died in July 2008, at the age of 82.\n\nThe painting depicts a Boy Scout giving the Scout salute; behind him is an American flag, rippling in an unseen breeze. The Scout's face is solemn yet confident. His brown eyes, cleft chin, and idealized face stand out to the viewer.

The opera house was opened in 1841 and up to 1945 was known as the Breslau Opera.\n\nAn Italian opera company was established in Wroclaw (Breslau) in 1725 by Antonio Maria Peruzzi, following a split with Antonio Denzio with whom he had collaborated in the Peruzzi-Denzio company at the Sporck theatre in Prague. The Theater on the Cold Ashes was opened in 1755 by Franz von Schuch (1716–1764) and performed operas till his death in 1764. His son, Schuch the younger, brought the first operas of Johann Adam Hiller to the Theodor Lobe's theatre in Breslau in 1770. His successor Johann Christian Wäser introduced more, including local Singspiel translations of works by Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny. In 1804 Abbé Vogler invited Carl Maria von Weber to conduct the Breslau Opera when he was only 18. The opera house was constructed in 1841 to designs by Carl Gotthard Langhans, supervised by his son Carl Ferdinand. It was remodelled twice after fires in 1865 by and 1871 by Karl Schmidt. After the first fire Theodor Lobe in 1867 invited the young conductor Ernst Schuch (1846–1914) to begin his career at the theatre.\n\nAfter World War I notable productions during the interwar years included Schönberg's \"Die glückliche Hand\" (1928). The music directors in this period included Franz von Hoesslin who was forced to leave the city, and Germany, in 1928.\n\nFollowing the inclusion of Breslau into Poland in 1945, the Lower Silesian Opera made its inaugural performance in Polish Wrocław on September 8, 1945 with Stanisław Moniuszko's \"Halka\" directed by Stanislaw Drabik. From 1945 to 1950 the building housed not only the Opera, but also theater, puppet theater and operetta performances. In 1997 the current Director Ewa Michnik, undertook the idea to use other venues during the complete rehab of the building (1997-2006). She created a series of mega-productions that took place around the city including the Centennial Hall, The National Museum courtyard and banks of the Oder River. This tradition became a trademark of Wroclaw Opera and continues to this day. The super productions are famous for interesting surroundings, attractive decorations and guest actors. The Opera also organized Wagner festivals building on the tradition of Wagner's involvement with Wroclaw Opera. The current repertoire of the Opera House includes \"Kot w butach\" (Puss in Boots) by Bogdan Pawłowski and \"Matka czarnoskrzydłych snów\" by Hanna Kulenty. The list of current productions is growing by the year. Several productions were rewarded both in Poland and Abroad. Wroclaw Opera is one of the leading Opera companies in Europe.\n\n\n"}
