He received his advanced musical education at the Eastman School of Music and his doctorate in philosophy at the State University of New York at Buffalo. He is Professor of Philosophy (Emeritus) at Long Island University, former Secretary-General and Past President of the International Association of Aesthetics, and former Secretary-Treasurer of the American Society for Aesthetics. His books and articles in philosophy focus on aesthetics, environmental aesthetics, and ethics. Arnold Berleant is the founding editor of \"Contemporary Aesthetics\", an international on-line journal of contemporary aesthetic theory, research, and application.\n\nAs a philosopher Berleant has written on important aspects of both aesthetic theory and the arts. These include ontological and metaphysical issues, basic theoretical questions such as appreciation and aesthetic experience, and explorations of music, architecture, painting and literature. His first book, \"The Aesthetic Field: A Phenomenology of Aesthetic Experience\" (1970), established the concept of the aesthetic field as a contextual framework within which questions in aesthetics and the arts can be most fully illuminated. Much of his subsequent work has focused on environmental aesthetics, attending both to general issues and to specific kinds of environment. The aesthetics of environment is a theme that he has elaborated and extended in much of his writing. \"In Art and Engagement\" (1991), Berleant exemplified the usefulness of the concept of the aesthetic field by applying it to a range of arts – landscape painting, architecture and environmental design, literature, music, dance, and film. Emerging from these original studies was the recognition that the different arts evoke experiences with their own claims to reality. Moreover, these experiences exhibit an intense, active perceptual involvement that he calls “aesthetic engagement,” which belies the traditional claim of aesthetic disinterestedness.\n\nThe innovative concept of engagement leads to new perspectives on a variety of traditional esthetic topics, including metaphorical language, urban design, music, and metaphysics, and opens less traditional topics, such as virtual reality and social interaction to aesthetic analysis.\nThe body of Berleant’s work challenges the traditional view of philosophical aesthetics, which posits “disinterestedness” as foundational in aesthetic experience. Berleant draws upon both phenomenology and pragmatism for an opposing theory of aesthetic perception based on the notion of engagement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Each association member's primary mission is to provide education and training in conservation through the awarding of an accredited degree. Since 1974, the conservation graduate programs have held an annual meeting at one of the member programs in order to give current students the opportunity to present current research to their peers.\n\nThe first conference of North American graduate programs in the conservation of art and other cultural property was held in 1974 at the Corning Museum of Glass in response to a flood that damaged the museum's artifact and library collection on June 23, 1972. While only three percent of the museum's glass collection sustained damage, over half of the museum's library holdings were lost or severely devastated. This five-day conference entitled, \"Conservation Seminar on Glass and Library Materials,\" was organized by Dr. Robert H. Brill, the Corning Museum's research scientist. For the first time, this conference brought together students, faculty, conservators, curators, and other museum specialists for several days of lectures and discussions on the field of conservation. Five American programs and a contingent from the Canadian Conservation Institute were in attendance; Cooperstown Graduate Program, Winterthur/University of Delaware, Intermuseum Conservation Association, New York University, Canadian Conservation Institute, and the Fogg Art Museum. Since the Corning Museum conference, annual meetings have become an integral part of ANAGPIC as a way to provide insight into the quality of the education provided by each program represented. Notable conservation professionals also present lectures during the conferences that address a specific area of interest in conservation, such as \"Extreme Conservation\" at the 2014 ANAGPIC conference. These lectures provide students with powerful insight on important issues for their future careers.\n\nThe Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property (ANAGPIC) was founded in May, 1984 by the following organizations: Buffalo State College, State University of New York, Art Conservation Department; Harvard University Art Museums, Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies; New York University, Conservation Center, Institute of Fine Arts; Queen’s University, Art Conservation Program; Winterthur/University of Delaware Program in Art Conservation; The University of Texas at Austin, School of Information, Kilgarlin Center for Preservation of the Cultural Record.\n\nThe general purpose of the Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property (ANAGPIC) is to “help serve the need of the conservation field for well-trained professional conservators by aiding its member training programs to attain their educational objectives.”\n\nIn order for organizations to be eligible for membership, they must have provided conservation training for at least three consecutive years, and they must award a diploma, degree, or certificate formally acknowledged by their parent academic association. Within that parent institution, the member organization must be a distinct program, whose primary mission is conservation education and training. The program's curriculum must have substantial components of problem-solving in conservation and conservation science, and should conform to the AIC Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice. The student to faculty ratio must also be no greater than ten students per faculty member, and these faculty members must have professional qualifications to teach conservation at a graduate level. This can be demonstrated through substantial professional recognition through the International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (IIC), the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC), or the Canadian Association of Professional Conservators (CAPC).\n\nAt least one meeting of the ANAGPIC is held annually, normally concurrent with the annual Conference of the Conservation Training Programs, at present held in late spring. Typically, each institution is represented by two student presenters. Other meetings can be called as necessary if agreed to by at least two-thirds of the membership. Each member organization is normally represented by the training program director/chairperson.\n\n Buffalo State College's Art Conservation Department was founded in 1970 as the Cooperstown Graduate Program in the Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, affiliated with the State University of New York College at Oneonta and with the New York State Historical Association in Cooperstown. In 1983, the program transferred to Buffalo State College, and then relocated to its campus in 1987. Since its founding, Buffalo State offers a master of arts degree and certificate of advanced study in art conservation upon the completion of a three-year graduate program which trains conservators of fine art and material cultural heritage. This program accepts only 10 students per academic year. Buffalo State is the largest four-year college of arts and sciences in the State University of New York (SUNY) system. Buffalo State's campus also hosts the Burchfield Penney Art Center and located across the street from the Albright-Knox Art Gallery.\n\nProgram Overview\n\nArt Conservation, M.A., C.A.S.\n\n\nAdmission Requirements\n\nThe following admission requirements represent the minimum qualifications a potential student must meet in order to be considered for a graduate program in art conservation at Buffalo State.\n\n\nSelected applicants are invited to Buffalo for an hour-long interview, scheduled for late March or early April of each year. Interviewees are asked to present a portfolio of artwork and a summary of their conservation experience, usually through a power point presentation. A color perception test is also administered.\n\nOverview\n\nThe Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies provides analysis and treatments for the Harvard Art Museums’ collection, consisting of more than 250,000 objects in all media, ranging in date from antiquity to the present. The Department of Technical Studies became the first institution in the United States to use scientific methods to study artists’ materials and techniques when it was founded in 1928 by Edward W. Forbes, director of Harvard University’s Fogg Museum. In 1994, the center was renamed the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies in honor of Philip A. and Lynn Straus, who were longtime benefactors of the Harvard Art Museums. In 1972, with the support from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Straus Center began their Advanced-Level Training Program which provides formal hands-on training in the conservation of works on paper, paintings, and objects and sculpture, as well as in conservation science. They offer three 10-month fellowships each year in which fellows can refine their practical and analytical skills through the examination and treatment of works of art from the Harvard Art Museums' collections. Fellows also have the chance to publish their original research.\n\nThe Conservation Center of the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University (NYU) was founded in 1960 with support from the Rockefeller Foundation. Since that time, the program has called for equal measures of art historical study, scientific training, and practical conservation experience. The goal was to produce a professional who would approach each object as an individual entity. The solution to an object's condition issues would be determined through research and study, unlike the tradesman restorer’s approach, which applied standard treatments to objects and problems. Unlike other conservation graduate programs, NYU awards a four-year, dual-degree graduate program where students earn both their Master’s in art history and Advanced Certificate in conservation. The Conservation Center is also the oldest degree-granting conservation program in North America.\n\nProgram Overview\n\nArt History, M.A. with Advanced Certificate in Conservation\n\n\nAdmission Requirements\n\nThe following admission requirements represent the minimum qualifications a potential student must meet in order to be considered for the conservation graduate program at the Institute of Fine Arts, NYU.\n\n\nSelected applicants are invited to NYU for an interview, during which they present evidence of their familiarity with as wide a range of artists’ materials and techniques through a portfolio of relevant studio arts and, if applicable, prior conservation work. The portfolio comprises a maximum of five studio pieces and no more than one treatment. Artist portfolios can contain examples of both traditional and non-traditional artists' techniques.\n\n Since its founding in 1974, the Master of Art Conservation Program (MAC) at Queen's University in Kingston has offered the only full-time graduate-level training program in the field of art conservation in Canada. The MAC program's treatment stream is completed in two years and allows students to specialize in one of the following: treatment of artifacts, paintings, or paper. Each student chooses a specialization upon acceptance into the program. Students in the treatment streams have the opportunity to work with the humanities, science, and engineering departments at Queen’s to undertake projects with museums, galleries, archives, the Canadian Conservation Institute, and industrial partners. Along with the treatment stream, the MAC program also offers a two-year research stream to science and engineering graduates, which would ultimately lead to a career in conservation science. Students in the research stream complete original research and a thesis surrounding topics such as the history of technology or other conservation-related areas.\n\nProgram Overview\n\nMaster of Art Conservation, M.A.C.\n\n\nAdmission Requirements\n\nThe following admission requirements represent the minimum qualifications a potential student must meet in order to be considered for the Master in Art Conservation Treatment Stream at Queen's University.\n\n\nApplicants who are offered an admissions interview are required to present a portfolio of their conservation and studio work.\n\nIn 1999, Getty Conservation Institute and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) formally announced their intention to work together in creating a graduate-level program in archaeological and ethnographic conservation that could complement existing programs and expand educational opportunities. Students are provided with a solid educational base and a developed appreciation of the complex range of issues relating to significance, access, and use of these materials. The UCLA/Getty Master's Program on the Conservation of Archaeological and Ethnographic Materials is the only graduate conservation training program on the west coast of the United States, as well as the only program to focus primarily on archeological and ethnographic materials. Unlike the other programs offered in North America, the UCLA/Getty program only admits students every two years, with an incoming class size between six and twelve students.\n\nProgram Overview\n\nArt Conservation, M.A.\n\n\nAdmission Requirements\n\nThe following admission requirements represent the minimum qualifications a potential student must meet in order to be considered for the conservation graduate program at UCLA/Getty.\n\n\nApplicants who are offered an admissions interview are required to present a portfolio of their conservation and studio work that demonstrates an understanding of the characteristics of materials and dexterity in their handling, fabrication, and preservation.\n\n The University of Delaware Art Conservation Department offers preservation degrees at the undergraduate, Master's, and PhD levels, including an undergraduate degree in Art Conservation offered at the Newark campus; a three-year Master's of Science in Art Conservation offered in collaboration between the University of Delaware & Winterthur Museum; and doctoral program in Preservation Studies in collaboration with the Center for Material Culture Studies at the University of Delaware. In January 1969, the Winterthur Board of Trustees approved the creation of a coordinated program in museum conservation that would utilize Winterthur's conservation laboratories and the science and humanities departments at the University of Delaware. The Winterthur/University of Delaware Program in Art Conservation (WUDPAC) is a three-year Masters-level Program leading to a Master of Science in Art Conservation. Currently, the Crowninshield Research Building of the Winterthur Museum houses 26 conservation studios, laboratories, examination rooms, and workshops used by faculty and students in the graduate programs, as well as the Winterthur Scientific Research and Analysis Laboratory equipped with state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation.\n\nProgram Overview \n\nArt Conservation, M.S.\n\n\nAdmission Requirements\n\nThe following admission requirements represent the minimum qualifications a potential student must meet in order to be considered for the conservation graduate program at Winterthur/University of Delaware.\n\n\nApplicants who reach the final stages of evaluation will be invited for an in-person interview, at which time they will present a portfolio of both two- and three-dimensional objects that demonstrate their art and crafts skills and their conservation experiences. During their time at Winterthur, applicants are also required to take a standardized test for alternate color vision, an examination of their freehand drawing skills, a one-hour chemistry exam, and complete a written opinion piece.\n\nThe annual meetings held by the current member organizations of ANAGPIC have become an eagerly anticipated event among students, faculty, and speakers. They not only provide a venue for students to present current research to their peers, but to also build camaraderie among the students \"that becomes the foundation of their future collegial relationships as practicing professionals.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Normally, most bird-and-flower paintings belong to the scholar-artist style of Chinese painting.\n\nAccording to Chinese tradition, bird-and-flower painting covers \"flowers, birds, fish, and insects\" (Traditional Chinese: 花鳥魚蟲, Simplified Chinese: 花鸟鱼虫 \"huā, niǎo, yú, chóng\"). It can thus deal with a wide range of natural topics, including flowers (plants), fish, insects, birds, pets (dogs, cats) etc.\n\nThe \"huaniao hua\" (花鳥畫) or \"bird-and-flower painting\" is proper of 10th century China. The most representative artists are Huang Quan 哳㥳 (c. 900 – 965) and Xu Xi 徐熙 (937–975). They are the masters of two schools: the first school was led by Huang Quan (imperial painter). It is characterised by an \"outline\" method of brush work, with emphasis on bright colours filling a meticulously outline (\"gongbi\"). The other school was led by Xu Xi (never entered into officialdom) and typically used techniques associated with ink-and-wash painting.\n\nThe bird-and-flower motif started appearing in Japanese art around the Muromachi period of the 14th century, and developed its own distinct style. It also entered \"ukiyo-e\" woodblock printing, where it was known as \"kachō-e\" (花鳥絵). Especially the \"shin hanga\" movement produced a number of works with this motif starting in the Meiji era. Artists working with this were Ohara Koson (1877–1945) and Ito Sozan (1884–?), as well as Imao Keinen (1845–1924).\n\nAccording to painting technique:\n\n\n"}

They also regularly stage shows at other Cambridge venues, annually at the Edinburgh Fringe and occasionally on tour abroad.\n\nThe Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club was officially founded during the Easter Vacation of 1855 by F.C. Burnand and a group of his friends, who had acquired back rooms in the Hoop Hotel on Jesus Lane during the course of the previous year.\nThe university’s response to the project was reported to have been ‘unfavourable’, but this did nothing to dampen the enthusiasm of those involved.\nThe club’s first presentation was a series of short one act plays of varying quality, of which the club’s first minute book reports that ‘the receipts were scanty, but a start was effected’.\n\nOver the course of the next five years, the society grew slowly but steadily.\nA contribution of £5 from each of the club’s members allowed the club to pay for the renovation of their cramped and bare rooms, and in 1860 the new stage at the Hoop Hotel, roughly on the site of the current building, was opened.\n\nThough the university’s approval was initially begrudging, attitudes towards the club changed over the course of the next 40 years, and by the beginning of the 20th century the club was a nationally renowned and respected group.\nTragedy struck in 1933 when the Hoop Hotel stage was destroyed in a fire.\nSupport flooded in, including messages of goodwill from the King, and a mere 18 months later a new building was opened by the club.\nThe ADC Theatre, now the oldest university playhouse in the country, was reborn.\n\nThe club continued to run the theatre until it ran into financial difficulties in 1974 when the university took over the running of the theatre, as a department of the university leasing the building from the club for a nominal annual fee.\n\nThe CUADC puts on around 20 shows every year. These cover a huge range of subject matter and playwrights, from comic to tragic, from Chaucer to Stoppard via Shakespeare and Beckett to name just a few. Although many are performed at the 228-seater ADC Theatre, where the club is the resident performing company, recent venues have also included the Corpus Christi Playroom, The Octagon at St Chad’s, King's College Lawn and the Round Church.\n\nConstitutionally, the club also has an obligation\nto spread interest in the theory and practice of theatre, in all its aspects, by every possible means amongst those qualified to be members of the Club; to encourage the active involvement of the same regardless of previous experience; and to maintain interest in the running of the ADC Theatre.\n\nTo this end, the club puts on a programme of professional and student-run workshops for actors, directors and technicians as well as a series of late-night experimental pieces known as One Night Stands.\n\nAnybody aged 17 or over, studying for a qualification at the University of Cambridge, or who is engaged in full-time study at any other educational institution within Cambridge is eligible for ordinary membership.\nFrom time to time special membership may be conferred onto people who do not otherwise qualify for ordinary membership.\nIt is a requirement that anybody participating in a show put on by the club must have some class of membership status for insurance reasons.\n\nThe club is run on behalf of its members by a committee of fourteen students of the university.\nThe President usually must have been a member of the committee the previous year and is elected by that committee, all other roles are elected by club members at the AGM, held in Lent Term.\nThe committee is in charge of show selection and support, as well as organisation of one-off events such as the annual garden party, annual dinner, and freshers' squash.\n\nThere is also a senior treasurer, who, by university statutes, must be a senior member of the university.

{"id": "24444324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24444324", "title": "Carousel (advertisement)", "text": "Carousel (advertisement)\n\nCarousel is an online advertisement launched in April 2009 by Philips to promote LCD televisions. The 139-second (2m19s) piece is a continuous tracking shot of a frozen moment after an armoured van heist gone wrong, with robbers dressed in clown masks holding a pitched battle with police officers inside a hospital. The campaign surrounding \"Carousel\" was led by the central Philips team at DDB in London and produced by advertising agency Tribal DDB in Amsterdam. It was directed by Adam Berg, with production contracted to London-based production company Stinkdigital. The ad went on to become a huge critical success, winning the advertising industry's most prestigious award: the Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival. It is only the second online advertisement to win in the Film category, after Dove's \"Evolution\" in 2007. Scenes from \"Carousel\" were used in the music video for hip hop artist 50 Cent's single \"Ok, You're Right\".\n\nAfter a credit sequence, \"Carousel\" opens on a police officer kneeling on a parked police car. The camera pans across and travels past an armoured van in mid-explosion. It continues to the entrance of a hospital, where two officers are engaged in a firefight with a criminal in a clown mask, while a further two are dragging a clown out of a station wagon. The camera passes into the hospital to a reception desk, where a clown is kicking an officer through a glass window while others come up behind him. The camera rotates upwards to reveal another clown/officer pair in midair after falling from a balcony above. The camera travels up to the second floor, through an explosion into a corridor filled with clowns and officers, with several civilians cowering against the floor. Passing a ward where more figures are shooting at each other, the camera reaches a clown carrying a sack of cash who has just been shot in the back, before panning right to reveal a team of officers around a man stripped to his underwear. The camera exits the window and returns to ground level, to the pointing officer on the car (revealed to be ) at the start. It scrolls past the officer, who hides a clown mask and a sack of cash, revealing that he is in fact one of the criminals. The piece then begins a fresh loop from the beginning.\n\nIn January 2009, Philips announced its new line of LCD televisions, promoting them as being the first production television whose proportions matched that of a cinema screen. To inform consumers about the product's features, Philips collaborated with their central agency team at DDB in London and advertising agency Tribal DDB in Amsterdam with a request to create an advertising campaign based around an educational website The team assigned to the campaign knew that many, many variations on \"real cinema experience\" advertisements had been tried in the past, and quickly came up with the idea of a piece composed of a single tracking shot. The team proposed the idea to several production companies, eventually settling on London-based production house Stinkdigital. After consultation with Stinkdigital about the possibility of having the tracking shot move through a frozen moment in time, the team brought on director Adam Berg, who had produced a similar advertisement for JC Jeans in 2006.\n\nWorking together with Stinkdigital executive producer Mark Pytlik, Berg began brainstorming ideas for the piece in February, including car chases and bank robberies. Eventually, they settled on the concept of a robbery gone wrong, with the clown-masked robbers escaping through a crowded hospital. The brief created, the team began scouting for locations to shoot the ad. Several hospitals in Prague were looked at, but with a recent outbreak of influenza in the Czech capital, most were unavailable. To speed up the location scouting, director of photography Fredrik Backar and post supervisor Richard Lyons accompanied the recce teams. Eventually, the team discovered an old Communist university which had been converted into a sports college, and gained permission to dress the location as a hospital.\n\nAn animatic was assembled exactly matching the proportions of the chosen location, though the action itself was made up by Berg as he went along. Tribal DDB had a schedule of seven weeks from the pitching to the end of post-production, and assigned two days for shooting the film itself. A crew of more than a hundred people was assembled for \"Carousel\". The 60-strong cast of extras mostly comprised Czech dancers and stuntmen, who had the muscle control necessary to stay sufficiently still for the extended filming sessions.\n\nThe path taken through the location was 100 m long, and was broken into seven shots. These were taken on Kodak Vision3 500T 35 mm film stock in an Arriflex 435 camera. Three cranes (a Fisher, a SuperTechnoCrane 50, and a Scorpio) and a motion-controlled rig were needed to produce the range of movement the camera takes through the scenery. Two versions of each of the shots were taken, one at 50 fps (instead of the usual 25 fps) to minimise any motion from the extras, and a second \"clean\" shot with all extras and suspended vehicles removed, to aid in post-production editing.\n\nEven with 90 percent of the final footage and stunts captured in-camera, the post-production work required for \"Carousel\" was extensive. An initial telecine transfer was performed by colourist Jean-Clement Soret at The Moving Picture Company in London. The palette for each room was slightly altered to give the illusion of separate spaces, and the colour grading was deliberately made \"flat\" to make video effects work easier. The footage was then passed to Stockholm-based visual effects company Redrum, where editing and 3D effects work was overseen by Richard Lyons, who had worked with director Adam Berg on his earlier JC Jeans advertisement. The first thing done was to stitch together the seven shots using video editing software Flame and Xpress Pro. 3-D elements such as flying debris, bullets, explosions and muzzle flashes were created by Magoo Studios using 3ds max. Other video effects work included wire removal and set extension. When the work was completed, another telecine transfer was performed to push the contrast and blend the added effects with the live-action footage.\n\n\"Carousel\" had been intended from the start to be primarily web-based, as it was felt that the length and level of violence in the piece were too great for screenings on television to be an option. A microsite was developed for the piece by Stinkdigital for Tribal DDB. Because of the time it would take to buffer a Flash video of \"Carousel\"'s length, a number of tricks were used to disguise the video's loading time. Buffering begins while users select their internet connection type on a page designed to look like an MPAA certification, and continues through a cinematic title sequence. The length of the title sequence varies depending on the connection speed selected.\n\nAt certain points during \"Carousel\", viewers can elect to switch to watching one of three short films blended into the tracking shot. When one of the films is selected, the effects which were added in post-production disappear, and the rigging used in production reappears. An actor portraying a member of the cast comes on to discuss an element of the filming or a feature of the product. In the first, the director of photography discusses the lighting techniques used in \"Carousel\". In the second, the director discusses the cinematic 21:9 aspect ratio and interacts with one of the extras. In the third, the VFX supervisor expands on the post-production process, and through a fake video-editing interface alters various aspects of the scene. The scripts for these short commentaries were written by Tribal DDB, with input from Stinkdigital and Redrum.\n\nThe soundtrack to \"Carousel\" was composed by Michael Fakesch. The music was altered for the Philips microsite by Stinkdigital so that, if users chose to move through the film at a different rate or in a different direction, the music would distort to match. Other features of the microsite included an Ambilight feature and the ability to switch at will between 21:9 and 16:9 aspect ratios.\n\nThe release of \"Carousel\" was a huge success. In just over two weeks, it had been viewed over half a million times, with visitors to the minisite spending an average of 5m20s watching the film. Of these, 50 percent used one or more of the interactive features of the site. A number of celebrities commented on the quality of the ad; actor Ashton Kutcher pointed followers of his Twitter account to it, and hip hop artist Kanye West referred to it as \"hands down the best video of the year\", Media publications made comparisons between \"Carousel\" and the opening scenes of the 2008 film \"The Dark Knight\", in which criminals wearing clown masks rob a bank under instructions from The Joker.\n\nIn June 2009, Philips collaborated with hip hop artist 50 Cent on the music video for his single \"Ok You're Right\". the video begins by zooming into a Philips 21:9 LCD television, and contains footage from \"Carousel\", as well as scenes of 50 Cent dressed as one of the robbers. The video was directed by Chris Romero, and featured 150 listeners of radio station Hot 97 as extras.\n\n\"Carousel\" received much critical acclaim from within the advertising industry. Editors of the trade journal \"Boards\" said of the piece: \"Technically, the stillness contrasted with the implied sound and fury is eerily fascinating, while the muffled sound design gives subtle, grim contextual cues. Masterful stuff.\" Early indications at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival, the industry's most prestigious awards ceremony, were that, with few stand-out televised candidates, the winner of the Film Grand Prix was likely to be an internet or viral film. As such, \"Carousel\" was pipped as a contender in both the Film and Cyber categories. Other potential winners in the Film category included \"Fate\" for Nike-brand sportswear, \"House of Cards\" for the homelessness charitable organisation Shelter, and \"Secrets and Lies\" for Levi's-brand jeans. In the Cyber category, \"Carousel\"'s prime competition was believed to be the \"Whopper Sacrifice\" campaign for Burger King. The 22 members of the awarding jury unanimously voted \"Carousel\" the winner for the Grand Prix in the Film category, and the winner of a Silver award in the Cyber category.\n\nA member of the awarding jury later said of the piece: \"Philips' \"Carousel\" is a prime example of forward thinking. Not only is it a remarkable, highly watchable film in its own right, but viewers could scroll across the piece online to discover films hidden within the film. One winds up spending ten or 11 minutes with the brand voluntarily – what is that worth to a client?\" As only the second online advertisement to receive the Film Grand Prix (after Dove's \"Evolution\" in 2007), \"Carousel\"'s win, and the potential effect on the future of the category, was widely remarked upon within the advertising industry. Rae Ann Fera of \"Boards\" commented: \"The Grand Prix winner was thrilling for [several] reasons. First, that an online-only film with well-integrated interactivity won the top Film award further signals the future direction of the industry.\" \"Campaign\" declared that \"It took the prize at Cannes not because it was made for online, but because it succeeds where many ordinary ads fail – it draws viewers in voluntarily\"\n\nThe first episode of the starts with a cold open that uses a similar time-frozen tracking shot.\nThe Other Guys features a similar scene, except it shows the antics of the protagonists at a bar.\n\nThe 2013 launch trailer for the video-game Payday 2 is almost definitely based on \"Carousel\".\n\nThe opening credits scene of the 2016 movie Deadpool is based on this ad according to the blu-ray audio commentary.\n\n"}

The group’s members included Alexander Bercovitch, Goodridge Roberts, Eric Goldberg, Jack Weldon Humphrey, John Goodwin Lyman, and Jori Smith. Goldberg and Lyman were both well represented by Max Stern's Dominion Gallery in Montreal.\n\nBy the late 1930s, many Canadian artists began resenting the quasi-national institution the Group of Seven had become. As a result of a growing rejection of the view that the efforts of a group of artists based largely in Ontario constituted a national vision or oeuvre, many artists - notably those in Quebec - began feeling ignored and undermined. The Eastern Group of Painters formed to counter this notion and restore variation of purpose, method, and geography to Canadian art.\n\nJohn Lyman's Contemporary Arts Society (1939–48) (in French, \"Société d'art contemporain\") evolved out of the Eastern Group of Painters.\n\n"}

The memoir chronicles the author's trip around the world after her divorce and what she discovered during her travels. The book remained on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list for 187 weeks. The movie rights for the memoir were purchased by Columbia Pictures. The film version, which stars Julia Roberts and Javier Bardem, was released in theaters on August 13, 2010.\n\nGilbert followed up this book with \"\", released through Viking in January 2010. It covered her life after \"Eat, Pray, Love\", plus an exploration of the concept of marriage.\n\nAt 34 years old, Elizabeth Gilbert was educated, had a home, a husband, and a successful career as a writer. She was, however, unhappy in her marriage and initiated a divorce. She then embarked on a rebound relationship that did not work out, leaving her devastated and alone. After finalizing her difficult divorce, she spent the next year traveling the world.\n\nShe spent four months in Italy, eating and enjoying life (\"Eat\"). She spent three months in India, finding her spirituality (\"Pray\"). She ended the year in Bali, Indonesia, looking for \"balance\" of the two and fell in love with a Brazilian businessman (\"Love\").\n\nColumbia Pictures purchased film rights for the memoir and has produced a film version under the same title. It was released on August 13, 2010. American actress Julia Roberts starred in the film; Ryan Murphy directed it. The film also stars Javier Bardem, James Franco, Richard Jenkins and Billy Crudup. Brad Pitt and Dede Gardner of Plan B, Pitt's production company, produced the film.\n\nJennifer Egan of \"The New York Times\" described Gilbert's prose as \"fueled by a mix of intelligence, wit and colloquial exuberance that is close to irresistible\", but said that the book \"drags\" in the middle. She was more interested in \"the awkward, unresolved stuff she must have chosen to leave out\", noting that Gilbert omits the \"confusion and unfinished business of real life\", and that \"we know how the story ends pretty much from the beginning.\"\n\nOprah Winfrey enjoyed the book, and devoted two episodes of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" to it.\n\nMaureen Callahan of the \"New York Post\" heavily criticized the book, calling it \"narcissistic New Age reading\", and \"the worst in Western fetishization of Eastern thought and culture, assured in its answers to existential dilemmas that have confounded intellects greater than hers.\" In addition, she was critical of Oprah's focus on the book, as well as Oprah's fans who enjoy the book, asking why her fans are \"indulging in this silliness\", and why they aren't \"clamoring for more weight when it comes to Oprah's female authors\".\n\nKatie Roiphe of \"Slate\" agreed with Egan about the strength of Gilbert's writing. However, she described the journey as too fake: \"too willed, too self-conscious\". She stated that given the apparent artificiality of the journey, her \"affection for \"Eat, Pray, Love\" is ... furtive\", but that \"it is a transcendently great beach book.\" \"The Washington Post\"'s Grace Lichtenstein stated that \"The only thing wrong with this readable, funny memoir of a magazine writer's yearlong travels across the world in search of pleasure and balance is that it seems so much like a Jennifer Aniston movie.\"\n\nLev Grossman of \"Time\", however, praised the spiritual aspect of the book, stating that \"To read about her struggles with a 182-verse Sanskrit chant, or her (successful) attempt to meditate while being feasted on by mosquitoes, is to come about as close as you can to enlightenment-by-proxy.\" He did, however, agree with Roiphe that her writing occasionally seems to be \"trying too hard to be liked; one feels the belabored mechanism of her jokes\".\n\nLori Leibovich of Salon agreed with several other reviewers about the strength of Gilbert's story telling. She agreed with Egan as well that Gilbert seems to have an unlimited amount of luck, saying \"her good fortune seems limitless\", and asking \"Is it possible for one person to be this lucky?\"\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\"'s Jessica Shaw said that \"Despite a few cringe-worthy turns ... Gilbert's journey is well worth taking.\" Don Lattin of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" agreed with Egan that the story was weakest while she was in India, and questioned the complete veracity of the book. Barbara Fisher of \"The Boston Globe\" also praised Gilbert's writing, stating that \"she describes with intense visual, palpable detail. She is the epic poet of ecstasy.\"\n\nIn early 2010, the feminist magazine \"Bitch\" published a critical review and social commentary called \"Eat, Pray, Spend\". Authors Joshunda Sanders and Diana Barnes-Brown wrote that \"\"Eat, Pray, Love\" is not the first book of its kind, but it is a perfect example of the genre of priv-lit: literature or media whose expressed goal is one of spiritual, existential, or philosophical enlightenment contingent upon women's hard work, commitment, and patience, but whose actual barriers to entry are primarily financial.\" The genre, they argued, positions women as inherently and deeply flawed, and offers \"no real solutions for the astronomically high tariffs—both financial and social—that exclude all but the most fortunate among us from participating.\"\n\nAndrew Gottlieb, an American comedy writer and producer, wrote a parody of Gilbert's Book, titled \"Drink, Play, Fuck: One Man's Search for Anything Across Ireland, Vegas and Thailand\". Gottlieb, in a 2010 interview with \"The New Yorker\", said, \"I was mystified by the success of \"Eat, Pray, Love,\" and I felt that the book, and its Oprah-sanctioned ubiquity, needed to be made fun of.\"\n"}

Unlike other fairs of this type, invited participants are not charged booth fees or percentages, and are even afforded transport and accommodations with area families. The Feria has grown from thirteen artisan participants to over eighty, and the organization is legally recognized in Mexico and the United States.\n\nThe Feria Maestros del Arte is an annual event and non-profit organization dedicated to Mexican handcrafts and folk art. As an organization, it is a recognized in both Mexico and the United States. The main focus is to support the continuing existence of Mexican folk art, which is disappearing in many places due to migration and industrialization. Volunteers work to find artisans, raise funds, set up and take down and all operations during the event.\n\nThe Feria is held every year at the Chapala Yacht Club in Chapala, Jalisco. This town in noted for its position on Lake Chapala as well as being home to many American and Canadian retirees who live or winter here.\n\nIt is a three-day event held every November, with the main attraction being stalls of merchandise brought by Mexican artisans for sale. As of 2015, there are over 80 participating artisans, from various Mexican states, especially Chiapas, Oaxaca, Michoacán and Jalisco. However, there have been representatives from as far north as Chihuahua and south to Yucatán. The wares vary from many kinds of pottery such as bruñido (burnished), petallillo, pineapple forms from Michoacan, recreations of pre Hispanic pieces, amate paper, alpaca cutlery, alebrijes from Oaxaca, wicker furniture, dolls, Catrina figures and numerous textiles, especially from Oaxaca and Chiapas. To date, the event has been popular mostly with foreign buyers, both living in and visiting Mexico, but it does attract a number of Mexican buyers as well. Many of the buyers are folk art collectors.\n\nThe artisans who participated are invited by the organization and change each year. These artisans are vetted by representatives of the Feria, with visits to workshops to see what is done, the quality and the make sure the wares are made by the artisans themselves. Some are already well known in Mexican folk art circles, such as those featured in works such as the Grand Masters of Mexican Folk Art, but others are completely unknown. Some are families who have done the craft for generations. As the purpose is to support the artisans, participants are not charged booth fees or a percentage of sales. Transportation of artisans is paid for by the Feria as well, with the same being housed by volunteer families in their homes. These families are mostly expats living in and near Chapala, and they not only provide beds, but also food and social outlets. The organization states that it helps to create inter-cultural bonds, and for many of the artisans, their first contact with the world outside their home. Some of the artisans are illiterate and many never have been out of their hometowns.\n\nThe Feria also incorporates musical events, dance performances, food and beverage tastings and had had talks by folk art experts such as Marta Turok, Susana Valadez and Marc Navarro. There have also been exhibitions of the making of objects and fashion shows to highlight the importance of traditional garments.\n\nThe idea for the Feria originated with Marianne Carlson, an American expat living in Chapala, Jalisco, who went to tour seventeen craft villages around Lake Patzcuaro in 2002. There she found craft traditions unknown to most people, and which instead were only sold in local markets and fairs.\n\nShe decided to organize a handcrafts and folk art fair in Chapala later that same year, with thirteen artisans participating. The original idea was to begin it as a business, but after the first event, Carlson decided against this.\n\nSince it began, the event has grown in size, both in volunteers and participating artisans, having had artisans from sixteen of Mexico’s 32 federal entities. The Feria association became a non-profit in 2008.\n\nIn 2012, the group sponsored the making of a giant cartonería (paper mache) alebrije by Alejandro Camacho of Xochimilco for the Mexico City Monumental Alebrije parade in 2012.\n"}

Produced by director Tiffany Rhynard and editor Heather Mathews, the immigration reform documentary had its world premiere in Los Angeles at Outfest on July 12, 2016. \n\nThe subject of \"Forbidden\" is Moises Serrano. When he was an infant, Serrano's parents fled Mexico in search of the American dream. Forbidden to live and love as an undocumented gay man in the country he calls home, Serrano saw only one option—to fight for justice. He is just like the thousands of other young people growing up in the United States with steadfast dreams, however being gay and undocumented in the rural South presents tremendous challenges. This film chronicles Serrano’s work as an activist, traveling across his home state of North Carolina as a voice for his community, and trying to forge a legal path for their future. \n\nSerrano's journey illustrates the intersection of queer and immigrant issues, highlighting the challenges facing LGBT people growing up in the rural South, where racism and homophobia are not uncommon. Part of the film takes place in the spring of 2016, when presidential candidate Donald Trump invoked heated anti-immigrant rhetoric. At the same time North Carolina passed discriminatory laws against the LGBT community. \"Forbidden\" humanizes the issues of immigration and gay rights, demonstrating how one individual has the power to combat the destructive oppression of an entire group of people. \nIn claiming his identity as undocumented, Serrano risked deportation for himself and his family. His story demonstrates courage, conviction and an unyielding quest to challenge the circumstances in which he was born. \"Forbidden\" has inspired many other undocumented people to speak out, tell their stories, and join with like-minded politicians to affect change to U.S. immigration policy.\n\n\n"}

In music the term may refer to a song combining styles or defying classification.\n\nThe sound of the term calls to mind other uses of \"buster\" such as \"crime buster\", \"Gangbusters\", \"Ghostbusters\", \"Dambusters\", etc.\n\nCreative people don't always feel comfortable working within an established category. So genre-busting within the publishing world has become a type of literary fiction.

{"id": "18618416", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18618416", "title": "Hadrian's Wall", "text": "Hadrian's Wall\n\nHadrian's Wall (), also called the Roman Wall, Picts' Wall, or \"Vallum Hadriani\" in Latin, was a defensive fortification in the Roman province of Britannia, begun in AD 122 in the reign of the emperor Hadrian. It ran from the banks of the River Tyne near the North Sea to the Solway Firth on the Irish Sea, and was the northern limit of the Roman Empire, immediately north of which were the lands of the northern Ancient Britons, including the Picts.\n\nIt had a stone base and a stone wall. There were milecastles with two turrets in between. There was a fort about every five Roman miles. From north to south, the wall comprised a ditch, wall, military way and vallum, another ditch with adjoining mounds. It is thought the milecastles were staffed with static garrisons, whereas the forts had fighting garrisons of infantry and cavalry. In addition to the wall's defensive military role, its gates may have been customs posts.\n\nA significant portion of the wall still stands and can be followed on foot along the adjoining Hadrian's Wall Path. The largest Roman artifact anywhere, it runs a total of in northern England. Regarded as a British cultural icon, Hadrian's Wall is one of Britain's major ancient tourist attractions. It was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987. In comparison, the Antonine wall, thought by some to be based on Hadrian's wall (the Gillam hypothesis), was not declared a World Heritage site until 2008.\n\nIt is a common misconception that Hadrian's Wall marks the boundary between England and Scotland. In fact Hadrian's Wall lies entirely within England and has never formed the Anglo-Scottish border. While it is less than south of the border with Scotland in the west at Bowness-on-Solway, in the east it is as much as away.\n\nHadrian's Wall was 80 Roman miles or long; its width and height varied according to the construction materials available nearby. East of the River Irthing, the wall was made from squared stone and measured wide and high, while west of the river the wall was originally made from turf and measured wide and high; it was later rebuilt in stone. These dimensions do not include the wall's ditches, berms and forts. The central section measured eight Roman feet wide (7.8 ft or 2.4 m) on a base. Some parts of this section of the wall survive to a height of .\n\nImmediately south of the wall, a large ditch was dug, with adjoining parallel mounds, one on either side. This is known today as the Vallum, even though the word \"Vallum\" in Latin is the origin of the English word \"wall\", and does not refer to a ditch. In many places – for example Limestone Corner – the Vallum is better preserved than the wall, which has been robbed of much of its stone.\n\nHadrian's Wall extended west from Segedunum at Wallsend on the River Tyne, via Carlisle and Kirkandrews-on-Eden, to the shore of the Solway Firth, ending a short but unknown distance west of the village of Bowness-on-Solway. The A69 and B6318 roads follow the course of the wall from Newcastle upon Tyne to Carlisle, then along the northern coast of Cumbria (south shore of the Solway Firth).\n\nAlthough the curtain wall ends near Bowness-on-Solway, this does not mark the end of the line of defensive structures. The system of milecastles and turrets is known to have continued along the Cumbria coast as far as Risehow, south of Maryport.\nFor classification purposes, the milecastles west of Bowness-on-Solway are referred to as Milefortlets.\n\nHadrian's Wall was probably planned before Hadrian's visit to Britain in AD 122. According to restored sandstone fragments found in Jarrow which date from 118 or 119, it was Hadrian's wish to keep \"intact the empire\", which had been imposed on him via \"divine instruction\".\n\nAlthough Hadrian's biographer wrote was the first to build a wall 80 miles long to separate the Romans from the barbarians\", reasons for the construction of the wall vary, and no recording of an exact explanation survives. Theories have been presented by historians, mostly of an expression of Roman power and Hadrian's policy of defence before expansion. On his accession to the throne in 117, there was unrest and rebellion in Roman Britain and from the peoples of various conquered lands across the Empire, including Egypt, Judea, Libya and Mauritania.\n\nThese troubles may have influenced Hadrian's plan to construct the wall as well as his construction of \"limites\" in other areas of the Empire, but to what extent is unknown. Scholars disagree over how much of a threat the inhabitants of northern Britain really presented and whether there was any economic advantage in defending and garrisoning a fixed line of defences like the Wall, rather than conquering and annexing what has become the Scottish Lowlands and defending the territory with a loose arrangement of forts.\n\nThe \"limites\" of Rome were never expected to stop tribes from migrating or armies from invading, and while a frontier protected by a palisade or stone wall would help curb cattle-raiders and the incursions of other small groups, the economic viability of constructing and keeping guarded a wall long along a sparsely populated border to stop small-scale raiding is dubious.\n\nAnother possible explanation for the wall is the degree of control it would have provided over immigration, smuggling and customs. \"Limites\" did not strictly mark the boundaries of the empire: Roman power and influence often extended beyond the walls. People within and beyond the \"limites\" travelled through it each day when conducting business, and organised check-points like those offered by Hadrian's Wall provided good opportunities for taxation. With watch towers only a short distance from gateways in the \"limites\", patrolling legionaries could have kept track of entering and exiting natives and Roman citizens alike, charging customs dues and checking for smuggling. Another theory is of a simpler varietythat Hadrian's Wall was partly constructed to reflect the power of Rome and was used as a political point by Hadrian. Once its construction was finished, it is thought to have been covered in plaster and then whitewashed: its shining surface reflected the sunlight and was visible for miles around.\n\nConstruction started in AD 122 and was largely completed in six years. Construction started in the east, between milecastles four and seven, and proceeded westwards, with soldiers from all three of the occupying Roman legions participating in the work. The route chosen largely paralleled the nearby Stanegate road from Luguvalium (Carlisle) to Coria (Corbridge), upon which were situated a series of forts, including Vindolanda. The wall in its central and best-preserved section follows a hard, resistant igneous diabase rock escarpment, known as the Whin Sill.\n\nThe initial plan called for a ditch and wall with 80 small gated milecastle fortlets, one placed every Roman mile, holding a few dozen troops each, and pairs of evenly spaced intermediate turrets used for observation and signalling. However, very few milecastles are actually sited at exact Roman mile divisions: they can be up to 200 yards east or west because of landscape features or to improve signalling to the Stanegate forts to the south. Local limestone was used in the construction, except for the section to the west of the River Irthing where turf was originally used instead, for unknown reasons; it was later rebuilt in stone. Milecastles in this area were also built from timber and earth rather than stone, but turrets were always made from stone. The Broad Wall was initially built with a clay-bonded rubble core and mortared dressed rubble facing stones, but this seems to have made it vulnerable to collapse, and repair with a mortared core was sometimes necessary.\n\nThe milecastles and turrets were of three different designs, depending on which Roman legion built them – inscriptions of the Second, Sixth, and Twentieth Legions, show that all were involved in the construction. The turrets were about apart and measured 14.02 square metres (150.9 square feet) internally.\n\nConstruction was divided into lengths of about . One group of each legion would excavate the foundations and build the milecastles and turrets and then other cohorts would follow with the wall construction. The wall was finished in 128.\n\nEarly in its construction, just after reaching the North Tyne, the width of the wall was narrowed to or even less (sometimes 1.8 metres) (the \"Narrow Wall\"). However, Broad Wall foundations had already been laid as far as the River Irthing, where the Turf Wall began, demonstrating that construction worked from east to west. Many turrets and milecastles were optimistically provided with wider stub \"wing walls\" in preparation for joining to the Broad Wall, offering a handy reference for archaeologists trying to piece together the construction chronology.\n\nWithin a few years it was decided to add a total of 14 to 17 (sources disagree) full-sized forts along the length of the wall, including Vercovicium (Housesteads) and Banna (Birdoswald), each holding between 500 and 1,000 auxiliary troops (no legions were posted to the wall). The eastern end of the wall was extended further east from Pons Aelius (Newcastle) to Segedunum (Wallsend) on the Tyne estuary. Some of the larger forts along the wall, such as Cilurnum (Chesters) and Vercovicium (Housesteads), were built on top of the footings of milecastles or turrets, showing the change of plan. An inscription mentioning early governor Aulus Platorius Nepos indicates that the change of plans took place early on. Also, some time during Hadrian's reign (before 138) the wall west of the Irthing was rebuilt in sandstone to about the same dimensions as the limestone section to the east.\n\nAfter most of the forts had been added, the Vallum was built on the southern side. The wall was thus part of a defensive system which, from north to south, included:\n\nFrom Milecastle 49 to the western terminus of the wall at Bowness-on-Solway, the curtain wall was originally constructed from turf, possibly due to the absence of limestone for the manufacture of mortar. Subsequently, the Turf Wall was demolished and replaced with a stone wall. This took place in two phases; the first (from the River Irthing to a point west of Milecastle 54), during the reign of Hadrian, and the second following the reoccupation of Hadrian's Wall subsequent to the abandonment of the Antonine Wall (though it has also been suggested that this second phase took place during the reign of Septimius Severus). The line of the new stone wall follows the line of the turf wall, apart from the stretch between Milecastle 49 and Milecastle 51, where the line of the stone wall is slightly further to the north.\n\nIn the stretch around Milecastle 50TW, it was built on a flat base with three to four courses of turf blocks. A basal layer of cobbles was used westwards from Milecastle 72 (at Burgh-by-Sands) and possibly at Milecastle 53. Where the underlying ground was boggy, wooden piles were used.\n\nAt its base, the now-demolished turf wall was wide, and built in courses of turf blocks measuring long by deep by high, to a height estimated at around . The north face is thought to have had a slope of 75%, whereas the south face is thought to have started vertical above the foundation, quickly becoming much shallower.\n\nAbove the stone curtain wall's foundations, one or more footing courses were laid. Offsets were introduced above these footing courses (on both the north and south faces), which reduced the wall's width. Where the width of the curtain wall is stated, it is in reference to the width above the offset. Two standards of offset have been identified: Standard A, where the offset occurs above the first footing course, and Standard B, where the offset occurs after the third (or sometimes fourth) footing course.\n\nAccording to Sheppard Frere, the garrison reflected the political rather than military purpose of the wall. The wall provided the soldiers with an elevated platform from which they could safely observe movement of the local population. It had \"heavy provision of cavalry\" which could sally out from any of the milestone gates though as mentioned earlier, the garrison was neither expected nor trained to the level necessary to defend a city wall. Overall the fortifications appear to have required additional strengthening after the initial design and were stronger than their equivalent in Germany, probably reflecting local resentment.\n\nFrere believes that the milecastles, which would have needed 1000–1500 men, were held by a patrolling garrison of Numeri, though he concedes that there are no inscriptions referring to Numeri in Britain at the time. Command headquarters was at Uxelodunum (nowadays called Stanwix) near Carlisle, where the Ala Gallorum Petriana was based. A signalling system allowed communication in minutes between Stanwix and York.\n\nFurther information on the garrisoning of the wall has been provided by the discovery of the Vindolanda tablets, such as the record of an inspection on 18 May between AD 92 and AD 97 where only 456 of the full quota of 756 Dutch and Belgian troops were present, the rest being sick or otherwise absent.\n\nIn the years after Hadrian's death in 138, the new emperor, Antoninus Pius, essentially abandoned the wall, leaving it occupied in a support role, and began building a new wall called the Antonine Wall, about north, in what later became known as the Scottish Lowlands, across the isthmus running west-south-west to east-north-east, sometimes referred to as the Central Belt or Central Lowlands. This turf wall ran 40 Roman miles, or about , and had significantly more forts than Hadrian's Wall. Antoninus was unable to conquer the northern tribes, so when Marcus Aurelius became emperor, he abandoned the Antonine Wall and reoccupied Hadrian's Wall as the main defensive barrier in 164. In 208–211, the Emperor Septimius Severus again tried to conquer Caledonia and temporarily reoccupied the Antonine Wall. The campaign ended inconclusively and the Romans eventually withdrew to Hadrian's Wall. Bede, following Gildas, wrote in [AD 730]:\n\nBede obviously identified Gildas' stone wall as Hadrian's Wall (actually built in the 120s) and he would appear to have deduced that the ditch-and-mound barrier known as the Vallum (just to the south of and contemporary with, Hadrian's Wall) was the rampart constructed by Severus. Many centuries would pass before just who built what became apparent.\n\nIn the late 4th century, barbarian invasions, economic decline and military coups loosened the Empire's hold on Britain. By 410, the estimated End of Roman rule in Britain, the Roman administration and its legions were gone and Britain was left to look to its own defences and government. Archaeologists have revealed that some parts of the wall remained occupied well into the 5th century. It has been suggested that some forts continued to be garrisoned by local Britons under the control of a Coel Hen figure and former dux. Hadrian's Wall fell into ruin and over the centuries the stone was reused in other local buildings. Enough survived in the 8th century for spolia from Hadrian's Wall to find their way into the construction of Jarrow Priory.\n\nThe wall fascinated John Speed, who published a set of maps of England and Wales by county at the start of the 17th century. He described it as \"the Picts Wall\" (or \"Pictes\"; he uses both spellings). \"A map of Newecastle\" (sic), drawn in 1610 by William Matthew, described it as \"Severus' Wall\", mistakenly giving it the name ascribed by Bede to the Antonine Wall. The maps for Cumberland and Northumberland not only show the wall as a major feature, but are ornamented with drawings of Roman finds, together with, in the case of the Cumberland map, a cartouche in which he sets out a description of the wall itself.\n\nMuch of the wall has now disappeared. Long sections of it were used for roadbuilding in the 18th century, especially by General Wade to build a military road (most of which lies beneath the present day B6318 \"Military Road\") to move troops to crush the Jacobite insurrection. The preservation of much of what remains can be credited to John Clayton. He trained as a lawyer and became town clerk of Newcastle in the 1830s. He became enthusiastic about preserving the wall after a visit to Chesters. To prevent farmers taking stones from the wall, he began buying some of the land on which the wall stood. In 1834, he started purchasing property around Steel Rigg near Crag Lough. Eventually, he controlled land from Brunton to Cawfields. This stretch included the sites of Chesters, Carrawburgh, Housesteads, and Vindolanda. Clayton carried out excavation at the fort at Cilurnum and at Housesteads, and he excavated some milecastles.\n\nClayton managed the farms he had acquired and succeeded in improving both the land and the livestock. His successful management produced a cash-flow, which could be invested in future restoration work. Workmen were employed to restore sections of the wall, generally up to a height of seven courses. The best example of the Clayton Wall is at Housesteads. After Clayton's death, the estate passed to relatives and was soon lost at gambling. Eventually, the National Trust began acquiring the land on which the wall stands. At Wallington Hall, near Morpeth, there is a painting by William Bell Scott, which shows a centurion supervising the building of the wall. The centurion has been given the face of John Clayton.\n\nHadrian's Wall was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987, and in 2005 it became part of the transnational \"Frontiers of the Roman Empire\" World Heritage Site which also includes sites in Germany.\n\nAlthough Hadrian's Wall was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987, it remains unguarded, enabling visitors to climb and stand on the wall, although this is not encouraged, as it could damage the historic structure. On 13 March 2010, a public event Illuminating Hadrian's Wall took place, which saw the route of the wall lit with 500 beacons. On 31 August and 2 September 2012, there was a second illumination of the wall as a digital art installation called \"Connecting Light\", which was part of the London 2012 Festival.\n\nIn 2003, a National Trail footpath was opened that follows the line of the wall from Wallsend to Bowness-on-Solway. Because of the fragile landscape, walkers are asked to follow the path only in summer.\n\nThe only ancient source for its provenance is the \"Augustan History\". No sources survive to confirm what the wall was called in antiquity, and no historical literary source gives it a name. However, the discovery of the Staffordshire Moorlands Pan in Staffordshire in 2003 has provided a clue. This small enamelled bronze Roman \"trulla\" (ladle), dating to the 2nd century AD, is inscribed with a series of names of Roman forts along the western sector of the wall, together with a personal name and phrase: .\n\nBowness-on-Solway () is followed by Drumburgh-by-Sands (), until now known only as from the late Roman document, the \"Notitia Dignitatum\". Next comes Stanwix (), then Castlesteads (). These are the four of the westernmost forts on Hadrian's Wall, excluding Aballava (Burgh by Sands).\n\nThere is no known word \"vali\", but \"vallum\" was the Latin word for an earthen wall, rampart, or fortification. In modern English usage \"vallum\" is applied to the ditch and adjoining mounds dug by the Roman army just south of the wall, but to the Romans a \"vallum\" was a wall and not a ditch (it is the source of the English word 'wall'). The genitive singular form of \"vallum\" is \"vallī\", so one of the most likely meanings is , \"of the \"Wall\". Omitting one of a pair of doubled consonants is common on Roman inscriptions; moreover, an error in the transcription of a written note could be the reason: another similar bronze vessel, known as the Rudge Cup (found in Wiltshire in the 18th century) has VN missing from the name , for example, although the letters appear on the Staffordshire Moorlands Pan. The Rudge Cup only bears fort names.\n\nThe name was Hadrian's \"nomen\", his main family name, the \"gens Aelia\". The Roman bridge and fort at Newcastle upon Tyne was called \"Pons Aelius\".\n\nThe translation, therefore, could be:\n\nMais, Coggabata, Uxelodunum, Camboglanna, according to the line of Aelian wall. [By the hand \"or\" The property] of Draco.\n\nAnother possibility is that the individual's name was Aelius Draco, which would only leave us with an unspecified \"vallum\", \"wall\".\n\nThe Latin and Romano-Celtic names of all of the Hadrian's Wall forts are known, from the Notitia Dignitatum and other evidence such as inscriptions:\n\nTurrets on the wall include:\n\nOutpost forts beyond the wall include:\n\nSupply forts behind the wall include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Wood uses the term to denote the contemporary conception of the \"big, ambitious novel\" that pursues \"vitality at all costs\" and consequently \"knows a thousand things but does not know a single human being.\"\n\nHe decried the genre as an attempt to \"turn fiction into social theory,\" and an attempt to tell readers \"how the world works rather than how somebody felt about something.\" Wood points to Don DeLillo and Thomas Pynchon as the forefathers of the genre, which continues, Wood says, in writers like David Foster Wallace. In response, Zadie Smith described \"hysterical realism\" as a \"painfully accurate term for the sort of overblown, manic prose to be found in novels like my own \"White Teeth\" and a few others [Wood] was sweet enough to mention\". Smith qualified the term, though, explaining that \"any collective term for a supposed literary movement is always too large a net, catching significant dolphins among so much cannable tuna\".\n\nWood's line of argument echoes many common criticisms of postmodernist art generally. In particular, Wood's attacks on DeLillo and Pynchon clearly echo similar criticisms other critics had already lodged against them a generation earlier. The \"hysterical\" prose style is often paired with \"realistic\"—almost journalistic—effects, such as Pynchon's depiction of 18th century land surveys in \"Mason & Dixon\", and Don DeLillo's treatment of Lee Harvey Oswald in \"Libra\".\n\nSome books described as examples of hysterical realism are:\n\n\n"}

The first was a hoard of Anglo-Saxon coins discovered in 1863. The second was a hoard of six Iron Age gold torcs that was discovered in 1968 and 1969. The latter hoard has been described as second only to the Snettisham Hoard in importance as a hoard from the Iron Age, and is held at the British Museum.\n\nThe first hoard was found in an earthenware pot buried about beneath the doorstep of the house at the corner of Old Buttermarket and St. Lawrence Lane in Ipswich, which had previously belonged to numismatist James Conder (1763–1823), when it was demolished during road widening in 1863. It was reported as consisting of 150 coins, although only 75 are known now. The coins were all silver pennies of the reign of Æthelred the Unready, minted in London and Ipswich. It is tempting to associate this find with the ravaging of Ipswich which took place in 991. However clues in the coins indicate that the hoard may have been deposited between 979 and 985.\n\nFive neck ornaments called torcs were discovered in 1968 by the operator of a mechanical digger preparing ground for the construction of new housing in Belstead, near Ipswich, for which the driver received £45,000; a sixth torc of a slightly different design was discovered a year later by the owner of one of the newly completed houses when sorting though a pile of earth left by the building in his garden, for which he received £9,000.\n\nThe torcs were manufactured by twisting two strands of large diameter wire around each other and fashioning them into a near circle. The ends of the twisted wire are finished with terminal decorations. They are made from green gold as they have a lower proportion of silver in them than later finds, leading British Museum experts to date their manufacture to about 75 B.C. However the torcs may have been used by many generations before they were hoarded away. The museum estimates that the maximum neck diameter of the people who wore these torcs was .\n\nThese would have been created in wax around the ends of the wire. The wax is then coated, at least once, with a ceramic slurry and left to harden. The ceramic is then heated which allows the wax to leave and gold is poured into the cavity. This lost wax process allows the terminals to include a level of detail that was initially created on the wax. The terminals created for these torcs were hollow. Each of the torcs has a slightly different design for the left and right terminal.\n\nThe 1968 finds are in room 50 of the British Museum, but there are also copies of these torcs in the Ipswich Museum.\n\n"}

It is typically used in buildings where the cost or weight of genuine marble would be prohibitive. Faux marbling is a special case of faux painting used to create the distinctive and varied patterns of marble - the most imitated stone by far.\n\nFaux stone painting was widely used in Pompeii, but it really took off in Europe during the Renaissance with two schools of faux painting developing. The Italian school was loose and artistic, the French school was formal and realistic. It typically took an apprentice 10 years or more to fully master the art.\n\nThe sophistication of the techniques are such that visitors are frequently unable to distinguish between false and real marble in many churches, palaces and public buildings in Europe. The techniques were perfected by the 17th century and have been used in all styles of construction well into the 20th century, including Baroque, palladian, neoclassical and historical revival styles as well as Art Nouveau and Art Deco buildings. Craftsmen who are able to replicate this work are still available, as evidenced, for example, by the extensive restorations of faux marble surfaces in important Eastern Europe buildings since 1990.\n\nThe art of marbling and graining reached its apogee in Britain between 1845 and 1870, and during this period the acknowledged master was Thomas Kershaw.\n\nKershaw was born in Standish, Lancashire England in April 1819. At the age of 12 he was apprenticed to Mr. John Platt of Bolton who was paid the sum of £23 by Kershaw’s father in order that his son could be instructed in the craft of house painting. He worked 10 hours a day for six days a week. He completed his apprenticeship at the age of 21.\nHe achieved international fame, winning a number of the most prestigious awards at the major exhibitions of the age; The Great Exhibition, London, 1851 - a first prize medal; Exposition Universelle, Paris, 1855 - a first class medal; London Exhibition, 1862 - first prize.\n\nKershaw's work was so good that it was often considered to be indiscernible from the original. He undertook work in many large houses, mansions and stately homes throughout England and Wales and once declined an offer from the Russian Ambassador to imitate marbles on the interior of the Imperial Palace in St Petersburg. In 1858 he produced one of his important works in the Blue Room in Buckingham Palace where all the pillars were done in imitation marble.\n\nIn modern times, William Holgate (1931-2002) from Clitheroe, Lancashire, was possibly the finest grainer and marbler in the world since Thomas Kershaw held the title 150 years before. His achievements include the prestigious award known as the \"Freedom of the City and Guilds of London\" and he was very proud to be made \"A Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Painter Stainers of Trinity Lane, London,\" on March 14, 1995. He was also given the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2001 Paris Salon. His apprentice and protégé, Andrew Johnstone continues his tradition.\n\nOther techniques for producing faux marble include Scagliola, a costly process which involves the use of specially pigmented plasters, and terrazzo. For flooring, marble chips are imbedded in cement, then ground and polished to expose the marble aggregate.\n\nSome professional faux finishers are very skilled and will use a variety of techniques to reproduce the colors, veining and luster of real marble or other building materials. However, many decorators will merely suggest the appearance of marble rather than accurately imitate a particular stone.\n\n"}
{"id": "19644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19644", "title": "Mein Kampf", "text": "Mein Kampf\n\nMein Kampf (, \"My Struggle\") is a 1925 autobiographical book by Nazi Party leader Adolf Hitler. The work describes the process by which Hitler became antisemitic and outlines his political ideology and future plans for Germany. Volume 1 of \"Mein Kampf\" was published in 1925 and Volume 2 in 1926. The book was edited by Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess.\n\nHitler began \"Mein Kampf\" while imprisoned for what he considered to be \"political crimes\" following his failed Putsch in Munich in November 1923. Although Hitler received many visitors initially, he soon devoted himself entirely to the book. As he continued, Hitler realized that it would have to be a two-volume work, with the first volume scheduled for release in early 1925. The governor of Landsberg noted at the time that \"he [Hitler] hopes the book will run into many editions, thus enabling him to fulfill his financial obligations and to defray the expenses incurred at the time of his trial.\" After slow initial sales, the book was a bestseller in Germany after Hitler's rise to power in 1933.\n\nAfter Hitler's death, copyright of \"Mein Kampf\" passed to the state government of Bavaria, which refused to allow any copying or printing of the book in Germany. In 2016, following the expiration of the copyright held by the Bavarian state government, \"Mein Kampf\" was republished in Germany for the first time since 1945, which prompted public debate and divided reactions from Jewish groups.\n\nHitler originally wanted to call his forthcoming book \"Viereinhalb Jahre (des Kampfes) gegen Lüge, Dummheit und Feigheit\", or \"Four and a Half Years (of Struggle) Against Lies, Stupidity and Cowardice\". Max Amann, head of the Franz Eher Verlag and Hitler's publisher, is said to have suggested the much shorter \"Mein Kampf\" or \"My Struggle\".\n\nThe arrangement of chapters is as follows: \n\nIn \"Mein Kampf\", Hitler used the main thesis of \"the Jewish peril\", which posits a Jewish conspiracy to gain world leadership. The narrative describes the process by which he became increasingly antisemitic and militaristic, especially during his years in Vienna. He speaks of not having met a Jew until he arrived in Vienna, and that at first his attitude was liberal and tolerant. When he first encountered the antisemitic press, he says, he dismissed it as unworthy of serious consideration. Later he accepted the same antisemitic views, which became crucial to his program of national reconstruction of Germany.\n\n\"Mein Kampf\" has also been studied as a work on political theory. For example, Hitler announces his hatred of what he believed to be the world's two evils: Communism and Judaism.\n\nIn the book Hitler blamed Germany's chief woes on the parliament of the Weimar Republic, the Jews, and Social Democrats, as well as Marxists, though he believed that Marxists, Social Democrats, and the parliament were all working for Jewish interests. He announced that he wanted to completely destroy the parliamentary system, believing it to be corrupt in principle, as those who reach power are inherent opportunists.\n\nWhile historians dispute the exact date Hitler decided to force the Jewish people to emigrate to Madagascar, few place the decision before the mid-1930s. First published in 1925, \"Mein Kampf\" shows Hitler's personal grievances and his ambitions for creating a New Order.\n\nThe historian Ian Kershaw points out that several passages in \"Mein Kampf\" are undeniably of a genocidal nature. Hitler wrote \"the nationalization of our masses will succeed only when, aside from all the positive struggle for the soul of our people, their international poisoners are exterminated\", and he suggested that, \"If at the beginning of the war and during the war twelve or fifteen thousand of these Hebrew corrupters of the nation had been subjected to poison gas, such as had to be endured in the field by hundreds of thousands of our very best German workers of all classes and professions, then the sacrifice of millions at the front would not have been in vain.\"\n\nThe racial laws to which Hitler referred resonate directly with his ideas in \"Mein Kampf\". In the first edition of \"Mein Kampf\", Hitler stated that the destruction of the weak and sick is far more humane than their protection. Apart from this allusion to humane treatment, Hitler saw a purpose in destroying \"the weak\" in order to provide the proper space and purity for the \"strong\".\n\nIn the chapter \"Eastern Orientation or Eastern Policy\", Hitler argued that the Germans needed Lebensraum in the East, a \"historic destiny\" that would properly nurture the German people. Hitler believed that \"the organization of a Russian state formation was not the result of the political abilities of the Slavs in Russia, but only a wonderful example of the state-forming efficacity of the German element in an inferior race.\"\n\nIn \"Mein Kampf\" Hitler openly stated the future German expansion in the East, foreshadowing Generalplan Ost:\n\nAlthough Hitler originally wrote \"Mein Kampf\" mostly for the followers of National Socialism, it grew in popularity after he rose to power. (Two other books written by party members, Gottfried Feder's \"Breaking The Interest Slavery\" and Alfred Rosenberg's \"The Myth of the Twentieth Century,\" have since lapsed into comparative literary obscurity, and no translation of Feder's book from the original German is known.) Hitler had made about 1.2 million Reichsmarks from the income of the book by 1933, when the average annual income of a teacher was about 4,800 Marks. He accumulated a tax debt of 405,500 Reichsmark (very roughly in 2015 1.1 million GBP, 1.4 million EUR, 1.5 million USD) from the sale of about 240,000 copies before he became chancellor in 1933 (at which time his debt was waived).\n\nHitler began to distance himself from the book after becoming chancellor of Germany in 1933. He dismissed it as \"fantasies behind bars\" that were little more than a series of articles for the \"Völkischer Beobachter\", and later told Hans Frank that \"If I had had any idea in 1924 that I would have become Reich chancellor, I never would have written the book.\" Nevertheless, \"Mein Kampf\" was a bestseller in Germany during the 1930s. During Hitler's years in power, the book was in high demand in libraries and often reviewed and quoted in other publications. It was given free to every newlywed couple and every soldier fighting at the front. By 1939 it had sold 5.2 million copies in eleven languages. By the end of the war, about 10 million copies of the book had been sold or distributed in Germany.\n\n\"Mein Kampf\", in essence, lays out the ideological program Hitler established for the German revolution, by identifying the Jews and \"Bolsheviks\" as racially and ideologically inferior and threatening, and \"Aryans\" and National Socialists as racially superior and politically progressive. Hitler's revolutionary goals included expulsion of the Jews from Greater Germany and the unification of German peoples into one Greater Germany. Hitler desired to restore German lands to their greatest historical extent, real or imagined.\n\nDue to its racist content and the historical effect of Nazism upon Europe during World War II and the Holocaust, it is considered a highly controversial book. Criticism has not come solely from opponents of Nazism. Italian Fascist dictator and Nazi ally Benito Mussolini was also critical of the book, saying that it was \"a boring tome that I have never been able to read\" and remarking that Hitler's beliefs, as expressed in the book, were \"little more than commonplace clichés\".\n\nThe German journalist Konrad Heiden, an early critic of the Nazi Party, observed that the content of \"Mein Kampf\" is essentially a political argument with other members of the Nazi Party who had appeared to be Hitler's friends, but whom he was actually denouncing in the book's content – sometimes by not even including references to them.\n\nThe American literary theorist and philosopher Kenneth Burke wrote a 1939 rhetorical analysis of the work, \"The Rhetoric of Hitler's \"Battle\"\", which revealed an underlying message of aggressive intent.\n\nAmerican journalist John Gunther said in 1940 that compared to the autobiographies of Leon Trotsky or Henry Adams \"Mein Kampf\" was \"vapid, vain, rhetorical, diffuse, prolix. But it is a powerful and moving book, the product of great passionate feeling\". He suggested that the book exhausted curious German readers, but its \"ceaseless repetition of the argument, left impregnably in their minds, fecund and germinating\".\n\nIn March 1940, British writer George Orwell reviewed a then-recently published uncensored translation of \"Mein Kampf\" for \"The New English Weekly\". Orwell suggested that the force of Hitler's personality shone through the often \"clumsy\" writing, capturing the magnetic allure of Hitler for many Germans. In essence, Orwell notes, Hitler offers only visions of endless struggle and conflict in the creation of \"a horrible brainless empire\" that \"stretch[es] to Afghanistan or thereabouts\". He wrote, \"Whereas Socialism, and even capitalism in a more grudging way, have said to people 'I offer you a good time,' Hitler has said to them, 'I offer you struggle, danger, and death,' and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his feet.\" Orwell's review was written in the aftermath of the 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, when Hitler made peace with USSR after more than a decade of vitriolic rhetoric and threats between the two nations; with the pact in place, Orwell believed, England was now facing a risk of Nazi attack and the UK must not underestimate the appeal of Hitler's ideas.\n\nIn his 1943 book \"The Menace of the Herd\", Austrian scholar Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn described Hitler's ideas in \"Mein Kampf\" and elsewhere as \"a veritable \"reductio ad absurdum\" of 'progressive' thought\" and betraying \"a curious lack of original thought\" that shows Hitler offered no innovative or original ideas but was merely \"a \"virtuoso\" of commonplaces which he may or may not repeat in the guise of a 'new discovery.'\" Hitler's stated aim, Kuehnelt-Leddihn writes, is to quash individualism in furtherance of political goals:\n\nIn his \"The Second World War\", published in several volumes in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Winston Churchill wrote that he felt that after Hitler's ascension to power, no other book than \"Mein Kampf\" deserved more intensive scrutiny.\n\nThe critic George Steiner has suggested that \"Mein Kampf\" can be seen as one of several books that resulted from the crisis of German culture following Germany's defeat in World War I, comparable in this respect to the philosopher Ernst Bloch's \"The Spirit of Utopia\" (1918), the historian Oswald Spengler's \"The Decline of the West\" (1918), the theologian Franz Rosenzweig's \"The Star of Redemption\" (1921), and the theologian Karl Barth's \"The Epistle to the Romans\" (1922).\n\nWhile Hitler was in power (1933–1945), \"Mein Kampf\" came to be available in three common editions. The first, the \"Volksausgabe\" or People's Edition, featured the original cover on the dust jacket and was navy blue underneath with a gold swastika eagle embossed on the cover. The \"Hochzeitsausgabe\", or Wedding Edition, in a slipcase with the seal of the province embossed in gold onto a parchment-like cover was given free to marrying couples. In 1940, the \"Tornister-Ausgabe\", or Knapsack Edition, was released. This edition was a compact, but unabridged, version in a red cover and was released by the post office, available to be sent to loved ones fighting at the front. These three editions combined both volumes into the same book.\n\nA special edition was published in 1939 in honour of Hitler's 50th birthday. This edition was known as the \"Jubiläumsausgabe\", or Anniversary Issue. It came in both dark blue and bright red boards with a gold sword on the cover. This work contained both volumes one and two. It was considered a deluxe version, relative to the smaller and more common \"Volksausgabe\".\n\nThe book could also be purchased as a two-volume set during Hitler's rule, and was available in soft cover and hardcover. The soft cover edition contained the original cover (as pictured at the top of this article). The hardcover edition had a leather spine with cloth-covered boards. The cover and spine contained an image of three brown oak leaves.\n\nThe first English translation was an abridgement by Edgar Dugdale who started work on it in 1931, at the prompting of his wife, Blanche. When he learned that the London publishing firm of Hurst & Blackett had secured the rights to publish an abridgement in the United Kingdom, he offered it for free in April 1933. However, a local Nazi Party representative insisted that the translation be further abridged before publication, so it was held back until 13 October 1933, although excerpts were allowed to run in \"The Times\" in late July. It was published by Hurst & Blackett as part of \"The Paternoster Library\".\n\nIn America, Houghton Mifflin secured the rights to the Dugdale abridgement on 29 July 1933. The only differences between the American and British versions are that the title was translated \"My Struggle\" in the UK and \"My Battle\" in America; and that Dugdale is credited as translator in the US edition, while the British version withheld his name. Both Dugdale and his wife were active in the Zionist movement; Blanche was the niece of Lord Balfour, and they wished to avoid publicity.\n\nHoughton and Mifflin licensed Reynal & Hitchcock the rights to publish a full unexpurgated translation in 1938. The book was translated from the two volumes of the first German edition (1925 and 1927), with notations appended noting any changes made in later editions, which were deemed \"not as extensive as popularly supposed.\" The translation, made by a committee from the New School for Social Research headed by Alvin Johnson, was said to have been made with a view to readability rather than in an effort to rigidly reproduce Hitler's sometimes idiosyncratic German form.\n\nThe text was heavily annotated for an American audience with biographical and historical details derived largely from German sources. As the translators deemed the book \"a propagandistic essay of a violent partisan\", which \"often warps historical truth and sometimes ignores it completely,\" the tone of many of these annotations reflected a conscious attempt to provide \"factual information that constitutes an extensive critique of the original.\" The book appeared for sale on 28 February 1939.\n\nOne of the earlier complete English translations of \"Mein Kampf\" was by James Murphy in 1939. It was the only English translation approved by Nazi Germany. The version published by Hutchison & Co. in association with Hurst & Blackett, Ltd (London) in 1939 of the combined volumes I and II is profusely illustrated with many full page drawings and photographs. The opening line, \"It has turned out fortunate for me to-day that destiny appointed Braunau-on-the-Inn to be my birthplace,\" is characteristic of Hitler's sense of destiny that began to develop in the early 1920s. Hurst & Blackett ceased publishing the Murphy translation in 1942 when the original plates were destroyed by German bombing, but it is still published and available in facsimile editions and also on the Internet.\n\nThe small Pennsylvania firm of Stackpole and Sons released its own unexpurgated translation by William Soskin on the same day as Houghton Mifflin, amid much legal wrangling. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Houghton Mifflin's favour that June and ordered Stackpole to stop selling their version, but litigation followed for a few more years until the case was finally resolved in September 1941.\n\nAmong other things, Stackpole argued that Hitler could not have legally transferred his right to a copyright in the United States to Eher Verlag in 1925, because he was not a citizen of any country. \"Houghton Mifflin v. Stackpole\" was a minor landmark in American copyright law, definitively establishing that stateless persons have the same copyright status in the United States that any other foreigner would. In the three months that Stackpole's version was available it sold 12,000 copies.\n\nHoughton Mifflin's abridged English translation left out some of Hitler's more antisemitic and militaristic statements. This motivated Alan Cranston, an American reporter for United Press International in Germany (and later a U.S. Senator from California), to publish his own abridged and annotated translation. Cranston believed this version more accurately reflected the contents of the book and Hitler's intentions. In 1939, Cranston was sued by Hitler's publisher for copyright infringement, and a Connecticut judge ruled in Hitler's favour. By the time the publication of Cranston's version was stopped, 500,000 copies had already been sold. Today, the profits and proceeds are given to various charities.\n\nHoughton Mifflin published a translation by Ralph Manheim in 1943. They did this to avoid having to share their profits with Reynal & Hitchcock, and to increase sales by offering a more readable translation. The Manheim translation was first published in the United Kingdom by Hurst & Blackett in 1969 amid some controversy.\n\nIn addition to the above translations and abridgments, the following collections of excerpts were available in English before the start of the war:\n\nA previously unknown English translation was released in 2008, which had been prepared by the official Nazi printing office, the Franz Eher Verlag. In 1939, the Nazi propaganda ministry hired James Murphy to create an English version of \"Mein Kampf\", which they hoped to use to promote Nazi goals in English-speaking countries. While Murphy was in Germany, he became less enchanted with Nazi ideology and made some statements that the Propaganda Ministry disliked. As a result, they asked him to leave Germany immediately. He was not able to take any of his notes but later sent his wife back to obtain his partial translation. These notes were later used to create the Murphy translation.\n\nSales of Dugdale abridgment in the United Kingdom.\n\n\nSales of the Houghton Mifflin Dugdale translation in the United States.\n\nThe first printing of the U.S. Dugdale edition, the October 1933 with 7,603 copies, of which 290 were given away as complimentary gifts.\n\nThe royalty on the first printing in the U.S. was 15% or $3,206.45 total. Curtis Brown, literary agent, took 20%, or $641.20 total, and the IRS took $384.75, leaving Eher Verlag $2,180.37 or RM 5668.\n\nThe January 1937 second printing was c. 4,000 copies.\n\nThere were three separate printings from August 1938 to March 1939, totaling 14,000; sales totals by 31 March 1939 were 10,345.\n\nThe Murphy and Houghton Mifflin translations were the only ones published by the authorised publishers while Hitler was still alive, and not at war with the U.K. and the U.S.\n\nThere was some resistance from Eher Verlag to Hurst and Blackett's Murphy translation, as they had not been granted the rights to a full translation. However, they allowed it \"de facto\" permission by not lodging a formal protest, and on 5 May 1939, even inquired about royalties. The British publishers responded on the 12th that the information they requested was \"not yet available\" and the point would be moot within a few months, on 3 September 1939, when all royalties were halted due to the state of war existing between Britain and Germany.\n\nRoyalties were likewise held up in the United States due to the litigation between Houghton Mifflin and Stackpole. Because the matter was only settled in September 1941, only a few months before a state of war existed between Germany and the U.S., all Eher Verlag ever got was a $2,500 advance from Reynal and Hitchcock. It got none from the unauthorised Stackpole edition or the 1943 Manheim edition.\n\nAt the time of his suicide, Hitler's official place of residence was in Munich, which led to his entire estate, including all rights to \"Mein Kampf\", changing to the ownership of the state of Bavaria. The government of Bavaria, in agreement with the federal government of Germany, refused to allow any copying or printing of the book in Germany. It also opposed copying and printing in other countries, but with less success. As per German copyright law, the entire text entered the public domain on 1 January 2016, 70 years after the author's death.\n\nOwning and buying the book in Germany is not an offence. Trading in old copies is lawful as well, unless it is done in such a fashion as to \"promote hatred or war.\" In particular, the unmodified edition is not covered by §86 StGB that forbids dissemination of means of propaganda of unconstitutional organisations, since it is a \"pre-constitutional work\" and as such cannot be opposed to the free and democratic basic order, according to a 1979 decision of the Federal Court of Justice of Germany. Most German libraries carry heavily commented and excerpted versions of \"Mein Kampf.\" In 2008, Stephan Kramer, secretary-general of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, not only recommended lifting the ban, but volunteered the help of his organization in editing and annotating the text, saying that it is time for the book to be made available to all online.\n\nA variety of restrictions or special circumstances apply in other countries.\n\nSince its first publication in India in 1928, \"Mein Kampf\" has gone through hundreds of editions and sold over 100,000 copies.\n\nIn the Netherlands the sale of \"Mein Kampf\" had been forbidden since World War II. In September 2018, however, Dutch publisher Prometheus officially released an academic edition of the 2016 German translation with comprehensive introductions and annotations by Dutch historians. It marks the first time the book is widely available to the general public in the Netherlands since World War II.\n\nIn the Russian Federation, \"Mein Kampf\" has been published at least three times since 1992; the Russian text is also available on websites. In 2006 the Public Chamber of Russia proposed banning the book. In 2009 St. Petersburg's branch of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs requested to remove an annotated and hyper-linked Russian translation of the book from a historiography website. On 13 April 2010, it was announced that \"Mein Kampf\" is outlawed on grounds of extremism promotion.\n\n\"Mein Kampf\" has been reprinted several times since 1945; in 1970, 1992, 2002 and 2010. In 1992 the Government of Bavaria tried to stop the publication of the book, and the case went to the Supreme Court of Sweden which ruled in favour of the publisher, stating that the book is protected by copyright, but that the copyright holder is unidentified (and not the State of Bavaria) and that the original Swedish publisher from 1934 had gone out of business. It therefore refused the Government of Bavaria's claim.\nThe only translation changes came in the 1970 edition, but they were only linguistic, based on a new Swedish standard.\n\n\"Mein Kampf\" was widely available and growing in popularity in Turkey, even to the point where it became a bestseller, selling up to 100,000 copies in just two months in 2005. Analysts and commentators believe the popularity of the book to be related to a rise in nationalism and anti-U.S. sentiment. A columnist in Shalom stated this was a result of \"what is happening in the Middle East, the Israeli-Palestinian problem and the war in Iraq.\" Doğu Ergil, a political scientist at Ankara University, said both far-right ultranationalists and extremist Islamists had found common ground - \"not on a common agenda for the future, but on their anxieties, fears and hate\".\n\nIn the United States, \"Mein Kampf\" can be found at many community libraries and can be bought, sold and traded in bookshops. The U.S. government seized the copyright in September 1942 during the Second World War under the Trading with the Enemy Act and in 1979, Houghton Mifflin, the U.S. publisher of the book, bought the rights from the government pursuant to . More than 15,000 copies are sold a year. In 2016, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt reported that it was having difficulty finding a charity that would accept profits from the sales of its version of \"Mein Kampf\", which it had promised to donate.\n\nIn 1999, the Simon Wiesenthal Center documented that major Internet booksellers such as Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com sell \"Mein Kampf\" to Germany. After a public outcry, both companies agreed to stop those sales to addresses in Germany. The book is currently available through both companies online. It is also available in various languages, including German, at the Internet Archive. The Murphy translation of the book is freely available on Project Gutenberg Australia. Since the January 2016 republication of the book in Germany, the book can be ordered at Amazon's German website.\n\nOn 3 February 2010, the Institute of Contemporary History (IfZ) in Munich announced plans to republish an annotated version of the text, for educational purposes in schools and universities, in 2015, when the copyright currently held by the Bavarian state government expires (2016). The book had last been published in Germany in 1945. A group of German historians argued that a republication was necessary to get an authoritative annotated edition by the time the copyright runs out, which might open the way for neo-Nazi groups to publish their own versions. \"Once Bavaria's copyright expires, there is the danger of charlatans and neo-Nazis appropriating this infamous book for themselves,\" Wolfgang Heubisch said. The Bavarian government opposed the plan, citing respect for victims of the Holocaust. Its Finance Ministry said that permits for reprints would not be issued, at home or abroad. This would also apply to a new annotated edition. The republished book might be banned as Nazi propaganda. Even after expiration of the copyright, the Bavarian government emphasised that \"the dissemination of Nazi ideologies will remain prohibited in Germany and is punishable under the penal code\".\n\nOn 12 December 2013 the Bavarian government cancelled its financial support for an annotated edition. The Institute of Contemporary History (IfZ) in Munich, which is preparing the translation, announced that it intended to proceed with publication after the copyright expired. The IfZ scheduled an edition of \"Mein Kampf\" for release in 2016.\n\nRichard Verber, vice-president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, stated in 2015 that the board trusted the academic and educational value of republishing. “We would, of course, be very wary of any attempt to glorify Hitler or to belittle the Holocaust in any way,” Verber declared to \"The Observer\". “But this is not that. I do understand how some Jewish groups could be upset and nervous, but it seems it is being done from a historical point of view and to put it in context.”\n\nAn annotated edition of \"Mein Kampf\" was published in Germany in January 2016 and sold out within hours on Amazon's German site. The book's publication led to public debate in Germany, and divided reactions from Jewish groups, with some supporting, and others opposing, the decision to publish. German officials had previously said they would limit public access to the text amid fears that its republication could stir neo-Nazi sentiment. Some bookstores stated that they would not stock the book. Dussmann, a Berlin bookstore, stated that one copy was available on the shelves in the history section, but that it would not be advertised and more copies would be available only on order. By January 2017, the German annotated edition had sold over 85,000 copies.\n\nAfter the party's poor showing in the 1928 elections, Hitler believed that the reason for his loss was the public's misunderstanding of his ideas. He then retired to Munich to dictate a sequel to \"Mein Kampf\" to expand on its ideas, with more focus on foreign policy.\n\nOnly two copies of the 200-page manuscript were originally made, and only one of these was ever made public. The document was neither edited nor published during the Nazi era and remains known as \"Zweites Buch\", or \"Second Book\". To keep the document strictly secret, in 1935 Hitler ordered that it be placed in a safe in an air raid shelter. It remained there until being discovered by an American officer in 1945.\n\nThe authenticity of the document found in 1945 has been verified by Josef Berg, a former employee of the Nazi publishing house Eher Verlag, and Telford Taylor, a former brigadier general of the United States Army Reserve and Chief Counsel at the Nuremberg war-crimes trials.\n\nIn 1958, the \"Zweites Buch\" was found in the archives of the United States by American historian Gerhard Weinberg. Unable to find an American publisher, Weinberg turned to his mentor – Hans Rothfels at the Institute of Contemporary History in Munich, and his associate Martin Broszat – who published \"Zweites Buch\" in 1961. A pirated edition was published in English in New York in 1962. The first authoritative English edition was not published until 2003 (\"Hitler's Second Book: The Unpublished Sequel to Mein Kampf,\" ).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Published in 2008 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the major themes of the book revolve around the Jungian concept of synchronicity, chaos theory, and the Butterfly Effect. Tornadoes and hurricanes, representative of chaos, propel the storyline across its twelve centuries.\n\nVigorito wrote this book as an experiment in literary synchronicity, starting with the title and inventing the entire story day by day according to the synchronicities of his daily experience. What emerged was an exploration of the Butterfly Effect, as what initially appears to be a chaotic storyline eventually relents into a tightly-interconnected series of events linked across time, space, and meaning.\n\nDiablo is serving a brief jail term in Normal, Illinois. One day, he happens to idly toss a playing card—the Joker—across his cell. From the scarce draft of the spinning card, a powerful tornado eventually forms that touches the lives of all the major characters, intersecting their lives in synchronistic fashion.\n\nBilly, the guard who released Diablo from jail, gave a ride to Diablo, who was hitchhiking outside the jail. Caught in the same tornado, Billy is torn from the driver's seat and tossed into the sky. Five years later, just after quitting a job, Diablo almost runs Billy down with his car. Billy now calls himself Billy Pronto and insists that he can only speak in the present tense.\n\nSpecial Agent J.J. Speed is a CIA agent and a former priest who changed his life after the tornado struck the Church in Normal, Illinois, at which he was conducting Mass. The tornado stripped him of his priestly vestments (along with the clothing of everyone else in the congregation) and sent them sailing into the sky. Twenty years later, stuck in a dead-end assignment in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, he happens across his priestly scarf—definitive as it was embroidered with his initials—being sold by a street vendor. He is shortly reassigned to New Orleans.\n\nElizabeth Wildhack is a dropout philosopher and a New Orleans stripper. She is the daughter of Bridget Snapdragon, who gave birth to her during the tornado that struck the Church in Normal, Illinois, just before her body disappeared into the sky. Elizabeth eventually meets Diablo, who has been selling seashell pipes on Bourbon Street for the last fifteen years, ever since he quit his job and Billy Pronto began haunting him.\n\nA year prior to their meeting, and two days after a thermonuclear bomb test in the Rub al-Khali, an overnight hypercane formed in the Gulf of Mexico. New Orleans, still raw from Hurricane Katrina years back, flees its path, but the world is soon startled to discover that this anomalous hypercane is not moving, taking up an apparently stable position in the Gulf. This hypercane is the latest incarnation of the tornado initially spun from Diablo’s playing card, which had been a dust devil in the Rub al-Khali gradually dissipating into nothing before the thermonuclear explosion caused it to grow in strength.\n\nWoven throughout the larger story is Clovis, runaway serf from the 9th century who stumbles upon the mythical Golden Bough, a scene which Bridget Snapdragon happened to paint on the kitchen wall while pregnant with Elizabeth. Possessed of the Golden Bough, Clovis is thereby granted solitary access to the underworld - the world beneath the illusions of time and meaning. Existing outside of time, he aspects the trickster, and amuses himself by orchestrating tremendous coincidences.\n\nNine Kinds of Naked met with generally favorable reviews, with \"The Sacramento Book Review\" calling it \"part quirky love story, part philosophical manifesto, and part metaphysical mystery...\", \"The Chicago Sun-Times\" calling it \"startlingly original,\" \"Texas Monthly\" calling it \"a crisp, sardonic voice,\" and \"The Daily Texan\" calling it \"a lyrical adventure.\" \"Publisher's Weekly\", however, observed that \"the book’s time shifts, innumerable eccentricities, chaotic narrative and 400 pages are enough to wear a reader out.\"\n\nThis story takes place in the same fictional universe as Tony Vigorito's first novel, \"Just a Couple of Days\". This is evidenced by intersecting scenes involving T-shirts displaying the message \"Argue Naked.\"\n\n\n"}

It won the W.D. Weatherford Award in 1998, the year of its release. Today, it is one of the most often picked community/library reads in the United States. It is also studied in many school systems around the world. \"October Sky\" was followed by \"The Coalwood Way\" (2000), \"Sky of Stone\" (2002), and \"Carrying Albert Home\" (2015).\n\n\"Rocket Boys\" was made into a film in 1999, titled \"October Sky\" (an anagram of \"Rocket Boys\"). The book was then re-published as \"October Sky\" shortly afterwards.\n\nHomer \"Sonny\" Hickam Jr. lives in a small coal mining town in West Virginia named Coalwood. Sonny, after seeing the Russian satellite Sputnik, decides to join the American team of rocket engineers called the Missile Agency when he graduates from school. (Note: In the book \"Rocket Boys\", the main character is always called Sonny. In the movie \"October Sky\", he is called Homer.) Sonny's older brother, Jim Hickam, excels at football and expects to get a college football scholarship. Sonny, however, is terrible at sports and has no special skill that would get him \"out of Coalwood\". Sonny's mother is afraid that he will have to work in the mines after high school. \nSonny's first attempt at rocketry (which occurred when he was 14) consists of a flashlight tube and model airplane body as a casing. It is fueled by flash powder from old cherry bombs. It explodes violently, destroying his mother's fence. After that, Sonny enlists the help of Quentin Wilson, Roy Lee Cooke, Sherman Siers, Jimmy \"O'Dell\" Carroll, and Billy Rose to help build rockets while forming the BCMA (Big Creek Missile Agency). Their first real rocket, powered by black powder, is named Auk 1. This an allusion to the great auk, which is a flightless seabird that became extinct in the mid-19th century. Auk 1 flies six feet before the solder melts, and the nozzle, a washer, separates from the casement. They call themselves \"Rocket Boys\" and call the place where they are launching their rockets \"Cape Coalwood\", in honor of Cape Canaveral. \nThe Rocket Boys enjoy mixed success during their three-year rocket launching campaign (1957 to 1960). They employ several fuel mixtures including rocket candy and a mixture called \"zincoshine\", which is composed of zinc dust and sulfur, along with alcohol from moonshine, supplied by a local bootlegger, as a binder for the mixture. They launch a total of 35 rockets, all sequentially numbered Auk I–XXXI. (There are five different Auk XXIIs.) \nThey also win a National Science Fair gold medal for their rockets, for their project titled \"A Study of Amateur Rocketry Techniques.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23317225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23317225", "title": "Organizational space", "text": "Organizational space\n\nOrganizational space describes the influence of the spatial environment on the health, the mind, and the behavior of humans in and around organizations. It is an area of scientific research in which interdisciplinarity is a central perspective. It draws from management, organization and architecture (Dale and Burrell, 2008) added with knowledge from, for instance, environmental psychology (Evans and Mitchell, 1998), social medicine (Macintyre et al., 2002), or spatial science (Festinger et al., 1950). In essence, it may be regarded as a special field of expertise of organization studies and change management applied to architecture. The knowledge area is related to evidence-based design in which the influence of the spatial environment on patient's health, healing, and customer satisfaction are being researched in health care. It is also related to practice-based areas of management such as facility management which is primarily devoted to the maintenance and care of commercial or institutional buildings and to property management in which the operation of real estate is central. Sometimes it is also referred to as organizational architecture. The scientific field of organizational space must be distinguished from social architecture in which the development of information and communication technologies is central and also different from space science which is concerned with the study of the universe.\n\nThis research strand distinguishes three different environments: the spatial environment from the physical environment and the built environment. \n\nThe coherence between the organization and its spatial environment may be regarded as an interwoven interdisciplinary cyclical flux from contingencies, intermediates, performances to interventions (Mobach, 2009). The contingencies are the organizational, architectural, technological, and natural conditions under which organization function. In the end they influence the performance of an organization, but first they mix in the intermediates. In this way humans in and around organizations will, for instance, notice these contingencies and will give them meaning (Clegg and Kornberger, 2006; Van Marrewijk and Yanow, 2010). Moreover, the contingencies will also influence social contact (Becker, 1981; Steele, 1973) and the degree to which a spatial environment can be functional (Sharles, 1923). Subsequently, the intermediates influence different performances, for instance, the health, the mind, and the behavior of people in and around organizations. The spatial environment can cause illness, such as with the sick building syndrome (EPA, 1991), but it can also positively influence the vitality of people or the recovery after an operation (Ulrich, 1984). The performances can provoke managerial intervention. In turn, these interventions will change the contingencies, and by doing so, change the elements, relations, and properties of the conditions under which people function.\n"}

Percy Thomas and the Percy Thomas Partnership put their name to a number of landmark buildings in the United Kingdom including the Wales Millennium Centre, Cardiff. It opened offices overseas and completed a number of prestigious buildings in Hong Kong. \n\nPercy Thomas Partnership came to an end in 2004 when they went into administration and were bought by Capita Group.\n\nPercy Edward Thomas was born in the northeast of England in 1883, but was well-travelled and started work as at a young age in Cardiff, Wales. He was articled to study architecture, and won the National Eisteddfod of Wales architecture competition in 1903. He returned to England to work, but began collaborating with Ivor Jones of Cardiff, in architectural competitions. In 1911 they won the competition to design Cardiff's new Technical College (now known as the Bute Building), and Thomas returned to Cardiff to work in partnership with Jones.\nPercy Thomas's architectural practice was set up in 1911/12.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s the practice won a large number of commissions to design important civic buildings in Wales and England, including county offices for Glamorgan and Carmarthenshire, Lord Davies' Temple of Peace, Swansea Civic Centre, Aberystwyth University campus and a redesign of London's Euston Station. \n\nThe partnership with Ivor Jones was amicably dissolved in 1937. \n\nIn 1946 Percy Thomas was knighted. In the same year Percy Thomas's son Norman joined the practice – which became known as Sir Percy Thomas & Son.\n\nIn 1952 William Marsden and Wallace Sweet joined the practice. John Francis Vergette joined (in Swansea) in 1955.\n\nPercy Thomas became seriously ill in 1962, retiring from the company in 1963.\n\nIn 1965 Sir Percy Thomas & Son were commissioned to design a new Roman Catholic cathedral, Clifton Cathedral, for the city of Bristol. The architect was Ronald Weeks A.R.I.B.A. Dipl Arch. Percy Thomas died in 1969. Clifton Cathedral was consecrated in 1973, by which time the architectural practice was known as Percy Thomas Partnership.\n\nJohn Vergette became Chairman and Chief Executive of Percy Thomas Partnership. He founded the Royal Society of Architects in Wales (RSAW) and was president 1971–73.\n\nPRP eventually had six offices in the United Kingdom, as well as offices in Malaysia, Hong Kong and elsewhere.\n\nOne of Percy Thomas Partnership's last works was the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff (2004). It was designed by Jonathan Adams, who had joined the practice in 1998. The award selectors for the Wales National Eisteddfod Gold Medal for Architecture 2005 described the building as \"a special place which will provide a focal point for the unique culture, identity and talents of Wales... The large mass of the building has been successfully formed into an impressive edifice as opposed to an oppressive monolith... In terms of texture, colour, selection of materials and spatial experience this is a feast to be enjoyed\".\n\n\n\nIn June 2004 Percy Thomas Partnership went into administration after cancellation of a large PFI project for the Ministry of Defence and delays of a number of other key projects. At the time, they had a turnover of £6 million, with 100 staff.\n\nThe company was bought by the large British outsourcing company, Capita, who created a new arm of their property consultancy division called Capita Percy Thomas. The staff and several senior directors were transferred to Capita.\n\nIn 2007 the name 'Percy Thomas' came to an end in the UK when Capita consolidated the architecture divisions within Capita Symonds into a new brand called 'Capita Architecture'.\n\n"}

Historically photo blanket were made of thick cloth depicting people, objects, and symbols intended to tell a story or reveal historical events.\n\nThe photo blanket has a history nearly as long as the history of clothing itself. For thousands of years, people around the world used blankets as a form of communication through storytelling, honoring dead, and a well-respected form of art.\n\nAncient Egyptians weaved colored threads and sometimes even gold into a fabric (usually linen) or by painting with inks and dyes on papyrus cloth. The cloth (blanket) would often form pictures to tell stories and to honor prominent people or one of the multiple gods of their culture.\n\nNavajo tribes used special indigo dye from Mexico and other vegetal dyes to color multi-ply yarns and weave them into three main types of blankets - a serape (a shoulder covering blanket that is longer than it is wide), a saddle blanket (a blanket that was folded in half under a horse’s saddle for extra cushioning), and a chief's blanket (a shoulder blanket that was made wider than it was long).\n\nNepalese rug makers - one of the most respected jobs in their society - would use luxurious silks, wools, and hemp to create beautiful works or art. Using vertical looms and fibers dyed with natural vegetal dyes, they form several different types of knots together for a soft and evenly tufted finish.\n\nFor hundreds of years, tribes throughout Indonesia and Africa have used a dye and resist technique called batik to create intricate patterns and pictures. During the past two or three centuries batik has become one of the principal means of expression of the spiritual and cultural values of Southeast Asia. Once again used as a form of storytelling and passing down history, picture fabrics and blankets have been an integral part of their culture.\n\nAsian cultures have used weaving and blankets for the same purposes, using gold and other precious metals woven into their cloths and blankets. As an important artistic form, it conveys the history and myths of a culture through iconography and pictures.\n\nThroughout history, photo blankets have been an ever present and fundamental key to communication, decoration, and tradition. Today’s photo blankets have changed to modern techniques and more efficient manufacturing, but the primary meaning has remained very similar. People display meaningful photos that represent memories and reveal history. Adding text or symbols communicate language and add to the blanket’s storytelling aspect.\n\nPhoto blankets are used throughout the home for displaying pictures and images as objects of decor, for warmth, or to be given and received as gifts.\n\nUses in home decor include furniture coverings and as decorative displays of a design or photograph. Photo blankets can be used to cuddle up for warmth either in or outdoors. They are often given as wedding, birthday, Christmas, baby, or anniversary gifts to individuals or couples displaying memorable pictures, dates and quotes on them.\n\nThere are three main types of photo blankets - woven photo blankets, knitted photo blankets, and dyed photo blankets.\n\nA woven photo blanket is made on a jacquard loom using digital software that scans a picture, creates a pattern and then creates a woven picture blanket using various colored yarns that interlace at 90 degree angles (see weave). Woven photo blankets, comes in two varieties; an afghan photo blanket and a tapestry photo blanket. The yarn used in the weave of an afghan photo blanket is the same thickness in both horizontal and vertical directions while a tapestry photo blanket is manufactured with yarn of two different diameters. In a tapestry photo blanket the thinner of the two yarns; i.e., the warp, actually consists of 6-8 different color strands of yarn which are combined in various ways, based on a photo, to re-create the colors as accurately as possible (even black and white). \n\nA knitted photo blanket is made by a machine that uses a similar scanning and pattern process, but instead of weaving the yarns together, knits them together in a looping technique (see knit). Often knitted photo blankets consist of limited colors due to the knitting process and the continuous thread forming loops in the process.\n\nA dyed photo blanket is the newest type of photo blanket and is made by printing dye onto fabric from a digital image (see dye sublimation). This type allows for unlimited colors and has the sharpest picture clarity of the three. \n\nEach process creates a permanent picture, with varying degrees of softness, color and clarity.\n"}
{"id": "1946883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1946883", "title": "Playing company", "text": "Playing company\n\nIn Renaissance London, playing company was the usual term for a company of actors. These companies were organized around a group of ten or so shareholders (or \"sharers\"), who performed in the plays but were also responsible for management. The sharers employed \"hired men\" that is, the minor actors and the workers behind the scenes. The major companies were based at specific theatres in London; the most successful of them, William Shakespeare's company the King's Men, had the open-air Globe Theatre for summer seasons and the enclosed Blackfriars Theatre in the winters. The Admiral's Men occupied the Rose Theatre in the 1590s, and the Fortune Theatre in the early 17th century.\n\nLess fortunate companies spent most of their existences touring the provinces; when Worcester's Men gained official permission to perform in London in 1602, they were, in a manner of speaking, \"coming in from the cold\" of a life of constant touring.\n\nThe development of theatre in England in the 16th and 17th centuries was not an isolated phenomenon; similar developments occurred simultaneously in other European countries, to greater or lesser degrees. The same broad factors influenced English actors as those that affected actors in neighboring countries, especially Scotland, France, Denmark, and states in northern Germany like Saxony and the Rhineland Palatinate. Yet conditions in other societies also differed significantly from those in England; the following discussion applies specifically to England in the 16th century and 17th century.\n\nIn the later Medieval and early Renaissance periods, wealthy and powerful English noble houses sometimes maintained a troupe of half a dozen \"players\", just as noblemen kept jesters or jugglers for entertainment. English theatre benefited greatly from the predilection for theatricality displayed by the Tudors. Henry VII kept a company of players called the \"Lusores Regis\", which probably consisted of four men and a boy who were used to swift costume changes and multiple roles. In the early period the difference between players, acrobats and other entertainers was not hard and fast. A troupe of players, however, was more costly to keep than a jester; players (who usually had other household duties as well) could defray expenses by touring to various cities and performing for profit a practice that began the evolution away from the medieval model of noble patronage and toward the commercial and capitalistic model of modern entertainment. It is from the scattered records of such touring, and from occasional performances at the English Royal Court, that our very limited knowledge of English Renaissance theatre in the early and middle 16th century derives.\n\nOne curious development of this era was the development of companies of pre-pubescent boy actors. The use of the boy player in companies of adult actors to play female parts can be traced far back in the history of medieval theatre, in the famous mystery plays and moralities; the employment of casts of boys for entire dramatic productions began in the early 16th century, which utilized the boys' choirs connected with cathedrals, churches, and schools. In time the practice took on a professional aspect and companies of child actors would play an important role in the development of drama through the Elizabethan era and into the Jacobean and Caroline periods that followed. (See: Children of the Chapel; Children of Paul's; Beeston's Boys; King's Revels Children.)\n\nThe playing companies did not need to spend money on scenery, and their stage props were often basic (necessarily, since every company made a substantial portion of its income by touring, and some companies toured consistently with no home theatre). Their costs in costumes, however, were high: actors playing kings, cardinals, princes, and noblemen had to look the part. Companies had hundreds of pounds of value invested in their costumes, in \"glaring satin suits\" and \"sumptuous dresses\" \"cloaks in scarlet with gold laces and buttons, and in purple satin adorned with silver;\" doublets of \"carnation velvet, flame, ginger, red and green; and women's gowns in white satin and cloth of gold.\" In 1605, Edward Alleyn estimated that his share in the \"apparell\" of the Admiral's Men was worth £100 and Alleyn was one of nine sharers in the company at the time. When a company got itself into financial difficulties, the members sometimes had to pawn their costumes, as Pembroke's Men did in the plague year of 1593.\n\nIn 1605 the actor Augustine Phillips left specific pieces of his wardrobe to an apprentice in his last will and testament including his \"mouse-colored\" velvet hose, purple cloak, white taffeta doublet, and black taffeta suit. To a modern sensibility, this may sound quaint and odd; but when \"a doublet and hose of seawater green satin cost £3\", the monetary value of Phillips' items was not negligible. Actors could face serious penalties for appropriating the costumes of their companies. [See Robert Dawes for an example.] (The players could defray some of their costs in the used clothing market. As an example, the King's Men bought discarded items of Gondomar's wardrobe for the actor playing the Black Knight in \"A Game at Chess\". Often, \"eminent lords and knights at their decease\" would leave articles of their finery to their servants much of it \"unseemly\" for servingmen and women to wear. Such garments would end up the property of the actors.)\n\nA second major cost lay in play scripts. In the years around 1600, playwrights could be paid as little as £6 to £7 per play (or about the price of two suits). Yet since the companies acted a constantly changing repertory, they needed an abundant supply of plays. Philip Henslowe's Diary records dozens of titles for the 1597–1603 period; when Worcester's Men were setting up for their first London season in 1602, they purchased a dozen new plays from Henslowe's stable of house playwrights, to supplement their existing stock.\n\nThe sharers in the company also paid wages to their hired men and boys. Wages differed somewhat over time and from company to company and case to case; but the general average minimum was 1 shilling per man per day, the same wage as that of an artisan worker. Boys cost perhaps half as much, though they were often maintained under some version of an apprenticeship arrangement, which could vary widely in details.\n\nPerformances at the public theatres were generally allowed six days per week; the theatres were closed on Sundays and major religious holidays like Good Friday. Other restrictions were laid upon the players, some of which they evaded as consistently as they could. They were supposed to cease playing entirely during Lent but violated this stricture regularly. In the spring of 1592, for example, the Lord Strange's Men played daily at the Rose Theatre right through Lent. After 1623, companies circumvented the Lenten restriction through the simple expedient of paying bribes to Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels.\n\nOne restriction that the players observed, one that was too serious to violate, was the prohibition enforced whenever bubonic plague rose from endemic to epidemic levels. Through much of the English Renaissance period, the theatres were shut down when the death figures in the plague bill (the weekly mortality report for London and some suburban parishes) rose above a certain level. In 1604 that cut-off number was set at 30 per week; in 1607 it was raised to 40. A serious epidemic closed the theatres almost entirely from June 1592 through April 1594; 11,000 Londoners died of plague in 1593. (The plague tended to abate in the colder weather of winter; the theatres opened for short seasons during the winter months of those years.) 1603 was another bad plague year, with 30,000 deaths in London; the theatres were closed from March 1603 to perhaps April 1604. \n\nOther serious epidemics caused theatre closures in 1625 (for eight months, to October) and from May 1636 to October 1637. These periods of closure were always traumatically difficult for the acting troupes; some survived by touring cities and towns outside London...and some didn't survive at all.\n\nThe explosion of popular drama that began when James Burbage built the first fixed and permanent venue for drama, The Theatre, in 1576 was the one great step away from the medieval organizational model and toward the commercial theatre; but that evolution was, at best, a \"work in progress\" throughout the English Renaissance. Throughout this period, troupes of actors needed to maintain the patronage of a noble household. The prevailing legal system in England defined \"masterless men\" who traveled about the country as vagabonds, and subjected them to treatments of varying harshness. Local authorities tended to be more hostile than welcoming toward players; the Corporation of London, from the Lord Mayor and aldermen down, was famously hostile to acting troupes, as were the Puritans. Noble patronage was, at the very least, the legal fig leaf that allowed professional players to function in society.\n\nIn some cases, more so toward the end of the period, noble patronage was nothing more than that legal fig leaf; a company of actors was an independent entity, financially and otherwise. Conversely, some noblemen were beneficent patrons of their players. The Lords Hunsdon Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon (c. 1524–96), and his son George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon (1547–1603) were valuable protectors of their own company, and, when they served in the office of Lord Chamberlain (1585–96 and 1597–1603 respectively), of English drama as a whole.\n\nThat company of Hunsdon's, known to posterity as The Lord Chamberlain's Men, was organized somewhat like a modern joint-stock commercial company (the concept of which was just beginning to evolve in this era) at its re-formation in 1594, after the long plague closure. The company had a small number of partners or shareholders, who pooled their funds to pay expenses and in turn shared the profits, in what was largely a de facto democratic way (at least for the sharers, if not for the hired men and apprentices they employed). Their main rivals, the Admiral's Men, suffered in contrast under a less ideal version of capitalist organization: Philip Henslowe functioned more like a blend of big-business autocrat, landlord, and loan shark. He managed multiple companies of actors and built and owned several theatres, and controlled players (sharers included) and playwrights by doling out payments and loans. (The silver lining in this cloud is that Henslowe's surviving financial records provide a wealth of detailed knowledge about the theatre conditions in his era that is unparalleled by any other source.) Other companies varied between these extremes of organization. (Francis Langley, builder of the Swan Theatre, operated much as Henslowe did, though less successfully, and for a shorter time.) \n\nDrama in the age of Elizabeth was at best an organized disorder; suppression of individual companies, and even the profession as a whole, for political reasons was not unknown. [See: \"The Isle of Dogs\".] Local residents sometimes opposed theatres in their neighborhoods. Individual companies of actors struggled and failed and recombined; tracking the changes has been the obsession of scholars and the bane of students. \n\nYet the drama was also enormously popular, from the Queen and Court down to the commonest of the common people; indeed, the odd polarity of the theatre audience in this period, with the High and the Low favoring the drama, and the middle class generally more hostile with the growth of Puritan sentiments, is a surprising and intriguing phenomenon. Theatres proliferated, especially (though not exclusively) in neighborhoods outside the city's walls and the Corporation's control in Shoreditch to the north, or the Bankside and Paris Garden in Southwark, on the southern bank of the River Thames: the Curtain, the Rose, the Swan, the Fortune, the Globe, the Blackfrairs a famous roster.\n\nKing James, \"VI and I\", was passionately fond of drama; and theatrical activity at Court accelerated from the start of his reign. Consider the following figures.\n\nIn roughly the last decade of Elizabeth's reign, 1594–1603, there were 64 theatrical performances at Court, for an average of 6 or 7 a year:\n\nCompare a total of 299 for a somewhat longer period in the first portion of James' reign, 1603–16, an average of more than 20 per year:\n\nThe major companies acquired royal patronage: the Lord Chamberlain's Men became the King's Men, and the Admiral's Men became Prince Henry's Men, under the patronage of the King's eldest son. A company of Queen Anne's Men was built out of the pre-existent Oxford's and Pembroke's Men, companies that were largely devoted to touring the provinces in the previous reign. In 1608 a company was organized under the title of the King's second son, the eight-year-old Charles; this company, the Duke of York's Men, was called Prince Charles's Men after Prince Henry unexpectedly died in 1612.\n\nCompanies continued to form, evolve, and dissolve in the early Jacobean era the King's Revels Children, the Lady Elizabeth's Men; but by the midpoint of James' reign, around the time of Shakespeare's death in 1616, the dramatic scene had generally stabilized into four important companies. These were: the King's Men, at the Globe and Blackfriars Theatres; Palsgrave's Men (formerly the Admiral's and Prince Henry's Men), at the Fortune; Prince Charles's Men, at the Hope; and Queen Anne's Men, at the Red Bull Theatre.\n\nTheatrical evolution continued, sometimes tied to the lives and deaths of royal patrons. Queen Anne's Men disbanded with the death of Anne of Denmark in 1619; the accession of a new queen in 1625 saw the creation of Queen Henrietta's Men. Occasionally there were other new companies like Beeston's Boys, and new theatres like the Salisbury Court. The two prolonged closings of the London theatres due to plague, in 1625 and 1636–37, caused significant disruption in the acting profession, with companies breaking apart, combining and re-combining, and switching theatres, in a dizzying confusion. (Only the King's Men were exempt.) Political suppressions also came along in the Stuart era, though they affected only single offending companies until a general political suppression closed the theatres from 1642 to 1660, and brought the age of English Renaissance theatre to its end.\n\n"}
{"id": "41443589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41443589", "title": "Reason and Morality", "text": "Reason and Morality\n\nReason and Morality is a 1978 book about ethics by the philosopher Alan Gewirth, in which the author attempts to develop a rational foundation for morality, beginning from the premise that every rational agent must have freedom and well-being. The book, which received positive reviews, is famous and has received much attention. It is the work for which Gewirth is best known. However, some philosophers have criticized Gewirth's arguments. Gewirth responded to many of the criticisms made of his work. Gewirth's work is defended by the legal scholar Deryck Beyleveld in \"The Dialectical Necessity of Morality\" (1991).\n\nGewirth discusses the rational justification of moral principles.\n\n\"Reason and Morality\" was first published in 1978 by the University of Chicago Press.\n\n\"Reason and Morality\" received a positive review from Robert Hoffman in \"Library Journal\". The book was also discussed in \"Choice\" from H. Oberdiek and J. M. Betz.\n\nHoffman wrote that the book was \"ambitious and careful\" and \"eminently worth reading.\"\n\n\"Reason and Morality\" received a positive review from the philosopher Loren Lomasky in \"The Philosophical Quarterly\". The book was also reviewed by E. M. Adams in \"The Review of Metaphysics\", and received discussions from Richard Brooks in the \"Journal of Legal Education\", the philosopher Marcus George Singer in \"Ratio Juris\", Ari Kohen in \"Human Rights Review\", Eric Reitan in \"Social Theory and Practice\", Brian K. Powell in \"\", Rutger Claassen and Marcus Düwell in \"Ethical Theory and Moral Practice\", and Anna-Karin Margareta Andersson in the \"Journal of Medical Ethics\".\n\nLomasky found some of Gewirth's arguments to be flawed, believed that Gewirth failed to establish the \"rationally necessary supreme substantive principle\" of morality, and noted that it \"has been suggested that the universalisation extending the proscription against interference as a normative rule incumbent upon all agents is invalid.\" He also questioned \"the concept of having a right to non-interference\", arguing that it was doubtful that the fact that people want freedom and well-being logically supported the claim that people have rights to these things. However, he agreed with Gewirth's view that the purposive and voluntary nature of action shows that it has a \"normative structure\", and believed that a view of morality similar to Gewirth's might be defensible. He concluded that Gewirth's book was \"an essential resource for all subsequent explorations\" of the issues it discussed.\n\nBrooks credited Gewirth with providing \"a complex and detailed brief for an individualist, humanist, ethical position\" and presenting \"a logical linkage between the system and legal decision making relevant to law students.\" Singer wrote that the book was \"justly famous\" and a \"masterful treatise\", and that it was praised by the philosopher Henry Babcock Veatch. According to Singer, the book became the focus of an \"immense volume of commentary\", with Gewirth's idea of prudential rights being especially controversial, having received criticism from Singer himself, as well as other authors. He noted that Gewirth had responded to the commentary on his work and that Deryck Beyleveld, in \"The Dialectical Necessity of Morality\" (1991), discussed criticisms of it and defended Gewirth's views, though in his opinion Beyleveld was not successful in defending Gewirth's view of prudential rights. He argued that while Gewirth book was original and brilliant, it had the defect that Gewirth's outlook excluded the possibility of reasonable disagreement about moral issues.\n\nKohen wrote that Gewirth's ideas had received nearly as much attention as those advanced by the philosopher John Rawls in \"A Theory of Justice\" (1971). He noted that Gewirth, assisted by Beyleveld, had responded to many of his critics, but argued that Gewirth failed to provide an adequate \"secular foundation for the idea of human rights.\" He criticized Gewirth's view \"that self-contradiction represents the most compelling argument against violating human rights\". He also argued that \"an agent might accept the first part of Gewirth’s theory about his own generic rights and reject without\ncontradiction the second part about universalizing those rights\" and that \"Gewirth’s prospective purposive agents are too far removed from the real world in which human rights are actually in play.\" He drew on the ideas of the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan to criticize Gewirth's work. Powell suggested that there was a \"decisive objection\" to Gewirth's views, which he compared to those of the philosophers Jürgen Habermas and Karl-Otto Apel. Claassen and Düwell compared Gewirth's views to those of the philosopher Martha Nussbaum. They noted that Gewirth's approach to morality \"has been widely discussed with regard to its basic assumptions and the strengths and weaknesses of its justification\" and that it has been \"applied to discourses about human rights, political philosophy, economy, and bioethics\".\n\nThe philosopher Jan Narveson, writing in \"The Libertarian Idea\" (1988), noted that \"Reason and Morality\" was an important work. However, he considered Gewirth's moral theory open to criticism. Narveson argued that while, according to Gewirth, rational agents must acknowledge a certain set of rights because those rights are required for their \"purpose-fulfilling actions\", such actions do not require rights but only \"enough noninterference by others\". He also rejected Gewirth's view that rational agents must acknowledge these rights for all in order to claim them for themselves, arguing that, in a person's capacity as a rational agent, they want only noninterference from others, and that this does not logically require them to accept \"the duties entailed by wholehearted acceptance\" of the rights Gewirth sees as following from people's need to engage in \"purpose-fulfilling actions\".\n\nJames P. Sterba, writing in \"The Oxford Companion to Philosophy\" (2005), stated that \"Reason and Morality\" is the work for which Gewirth is best known.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14224671", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14224671", "title": "Riverside Shakespeare Company", "text": "Riverside Shakespeare Company\n\nThe Riverside Shakespeare Company of New York City was founded in 1977 as a professional (AEA) theatre company on the Upper West Side of New York City, by W. Stuart McDowell and Gloria Skurski. Focusing on Shakespeare plays and other classical repertoire, it operated through 1997.\n\nFounded with a core of graduates from the University of California at Berkeley, the Riverside Shakespeare Company of New York City opened its first production, \"Romeo and Juliet\", in August 1977 in Riverside Park. It then commenced a free parks tour through Manhattan, performing in Washington Square, John Jay Park, Fort Tryon Park, and Columbia University. The production was directed by McDowell.\n\nAn opening-night announcement in \"The New York Times\" read:\n\nThe Riverside Shakespeare Company is taking up where Joseph Papp left off this summer by presenting free Shakespeare in the park... The production will be done in traveling minstrel style, evocative of Shakespeare's time. Beforehand, to set the period mood, performers will be scattered around the park – jugglers, fencers, singers, poetry readers. Then a fanfare will call the players to the stage, and the tale of star-cross'd lovers will begin.\n\nThe inaugural production of \"Romeo and Juliet\" was a two-hour version, trimmed to incorporate extensive swordplay, an extended ballroom dance scene, and pantomime, such as the appearance to Juliet of Tybalt's ghost. Each performance was also timed to end with the setting of the sun in mid August. Performances were preceded by the entire company of actors and musicians entertaining the audience with a \"Greenshow\" – a preshow spoof of the production to follow, that served the dual purpose of building a comedic, physical bridge between actor and audience, and of establishing a physical, spontaneous style of acting that incorporated the performance environment into the show. This drew on the roots of the company – and of Shakespeare – in the rich heritage of Commedia dell'arte.\n\nThe following autumn, the company began a series of readings of the works of Shakespeare, reading through the entire canon the first year. Growing out of this, the company inaugurated a series of free radio broadcasts of Shakespeare's works on the New York public radio station, WBAI. A board of directors was soon formed under the guidance of founding chairperson, Elena Scotti of Lincoln Center. At its founding in 1977, the Riverside Shakespeare Company became New York City's only year-round professional Shakespeare company dedicated to the performance of the works of Shakespeare, his contemporaries, and Commedia dell'arte.\n\nDuring its inaugural 1977–1978 season, after its parks tour of \"Romeo & Juliet\", the Riverside Shakespeare Company presented a free 'Equity library tour' of \"Twelfth Night\", directed by Gloria Skurski, with music by Michael Moore, which then had an extended run Off Broadway at the Manhattan Theatre Club Stage 73. Judy Thrall, in the \"Heights/Inwood Press of North Manhattan\" reviewed the production of \"Twelfth Night\":\n\nSome theatre companies – those which start out with talented and intelligent actors – are born great. Some companies – those which start out with diffident, inexperienced people who soon mature with their art – achieve greatness. And some companies – those which start out untrained and unguided – can, with the advent of a brilliant force, have greatness thrust upon them. In the first hyperbolic category is one of the city's newest theater groups, the Riverside Shakespeare Company... Now the group is well on its way to becoming an important theatrical force in Upper Manhattan and elsewhere.\n\nIn the spring of 1978, the company mounted the complete \"Hamlet\" on the courtyard roof of Riverside Church in Manhattan in late afternoon. The success of this production enabled the company to remount its \"Hamlet\" – this time lit by torches in the late evening – on the main \"University Walk\" before the Low Library at Columbia University, using a large stage surrounded by sheets of steel, erected to create a reflective environment for both the voice and the torch illumination. The production was designed and directed by W. Stuart McDowell and featured Peter Siiteri as Hamlet.\n\nRiverside's \"Hamlet\" marked its first \"First Folio Production\", in which the entire text of Shakespeare's play was presented in a lively, action-filled production, enabling the company to mount the complete \"Hamlet\" in under three hours. A \"Greenshow\" also preceded each outdoor performance, entertaining the audience as they arrived in a spoof of the play to follow, which was staged by \"the Players\" en route to \"Elsinore\".\n\nThe torchlit performance of \"Hamlet\" at Columbia University was reviewed by \"Heights/Innwood Newspaper of North Manhattan\":\n\nSiiteri's sly innuendoes and elegant gestures as Hamlet were put to good use. His reactions in his father's ghost and in Ophelia's death had traces of the vulnerability and humanity seen in the finest Hamlets. Others in the cast ranged from very good to superb. Kaeren Peregrin as Ophelia gave a chilling \"mad scene\". Robert Lanchester as Claudius was delightfully depraved, and Frank Fico as Polonius was wonderfully amusing without turning the endearing and gentleman into a buffoon. Bravo also to John Rowe as Laertes... All of the actors projected magnificently without the aid of microphones – and this in the open air!\n\nIn its second summer, 1978, the company presented a popular free tour of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", with Eric Hoffmann as Puck, Karen Hurley as Titania, and Eric Conger as Oberon, directed by Gloria Skurski. An original score by Deborah Awner was performed by the touring group \"Brass\". The production continued the tradition of un-miked Shakespeare, making use of a sheet-steel touring set for natural amplification of both actors and musicians.\n\nThe parks tour of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" was expanded to play locations in three boroughs of New York City, including Wave Hill in the Bronx, which became a favorite annual summer performing site for the company.\n\nIn what was becoming a Riverside tradition, each performance was preceded a half hour before curtain by a \"Greenshow\" of Commedia entertainment, by the cast and musicians on the stage and throughout the audience.\n\nErika Munk of the \"Village Voice\" wrote:\n\nShakespeare at the Delacorte always disappoints me because it's overmiked and not in tune with park life; but I saw a charming \"Midsummer Night's Dream\" by the Riverside Shakespeare Company: no mikes, no lights, no seats; only clever placement at the bottom of Soldier and Sailors Monument to give the audience a view from the steps; broad acting and old-fashioned projection so that everyone could follow; an ability to capitalize on the audience's pre-disposition to enjoy itself; the flexibility to deal with dogs, kids, jets, and drunks; and splendid timing – the play ended as the sun went down.\n\nThe following fall the company staged \"As You Like It\" at the Manhattan Theatre Club's Stage 73, featuring Robert Boyle, Timothy Hall, Margo Gruber and Caryn West – all making their New York stage debut; with Kent Odell, Jim Maxson, Stuart Rudin, Ken Grantham, Timothy Hall, Peter Jensen, Kenneth Lane, Gannon McHale, Sheri Meyers, Uriel Menson, Brock Seawell, Daniel Tamm, and David Robert Westfall (stage manager), and directed by Eric Hoffmann, with set designed by David Lockner, costumes by Deborah Otte, lighting by Nat Cohen, and music by Deborah Awner.\n\nHoffmann set Shakespeare's most pastoral play with an autumnal setting in Colonial American, using leaves gathered from Central Park, which gradually filled the stage with knee-deep piles of leaves, and underscored with original guitar music played by Robert Mamary and Joseph Poshek. The production was acclaimed for its creative setting in this bucolic, pre-American revolutionary time, in which Amiens, played by Larry Kirchgaessner, became a Native American in the American forest of Arden.\n\nThe production was attended by Mildred Natwick, who became the company's first member of its Board of Advisors, soon to be followed by Helen Hayes. At this production, it was announced that the company's ultimate goal was \"to build a replica of Shakespeare's Globe Theater on the banks of the Hudson River in New York City.\"\n\nThe production of \"As You Like It\" was joined at Stage 73 by the New York premiere of the Commedia dell'arte scenario, the 16th century \"madrigal comedy\" by Orazio Vecchi, \"L'Amfi Parnasso\", directed by Dan Southern featuring company members performing with Renaissance music arranged and played by the chamber group \"The Western Wind\". This production was the company's first purely Commedia dell'arte style production, and featured the use of hand-crafted leather masks, improvisation, stylized movement and comic lazzi.\n\nIn April 1979, the theatre company mounted a new production of \"Twelfth Night\", set in an Art Nouveau style, directed by John Clingerman, with Andrew Achsen, Kristin Rudrud, Stuart Cohen, Alison Edwards, Beata Jachulski, Will Lecki, Scott Parson, Bruce Altman, and Ted Polites, staged in the round (with audiences on four sides) in the lower chamber of Riverside Church in Manhattan, featuring music by Deborah Awner. This production was one of many that the theatre company opened on Shakespeare's birthday, April 23; this time, the production was inaugurated by a special celebration, culminating with the reading of a Shakespearean sonnet by the pastor of Riverside Church, fellow Bardophile, Rev. William Sloan Coffin.\n\nFrom 1978 to 1980, the Riverside Shakespeare Company was the professional Equity theater company in residence at Columbia University under the sponsorship of Andrew B. Harris and internationally renowned Shakespeare scholar Bernard Beckerman, with audition, construction, storage and rehearsal spaces in Prentice Hall on West 125th Street west of Broadway, just a stone's throw from the Hudson River. A core company of twelve to fifteen professional actors were often complemented with Columbia University students both backstage and onstage as performers, working as student apprentices within the company, not unlike Shakespeare's company 400 years before.\n\nEarly in 1979 the company produced \"Much Ado About Nothing\" directed by Gloria Skurski with original music by Deborah Awner, with Margo Gruber and Gannon McHale, and Timothy Oman, Jim Brewster, Robert Boyle, Ronald Lew Harris, David Florek, Arland Russell, Daniel Tam and Leigh Podgorski, at Manhattan Theatre Club's Stage 73. The production was set in the roaring 20's, as if F. Scott Fitzgerald had imagined the meeting of Beatrice and Benedict at a festive garden party on Cape Cod.\n\nThe production of \"Much Ado About Nothing\" was staged as the first part of a double bill, followed by a glass of wine and then, on the same stage with a quick change of scenery, by Niccolo Machiavelli's \"The Mandrake\".\n\nThe company then mounted its first History Play by Shakespeare. In the late spring of 1979, after two months rehearsal of the armies of King Henry and Hotspur on the rooftop of Columbia University's Prentice Hall in southern Harlem, the company opened its third annual outdoor production of free Shakespeare, a major Equity staging of the complete \"Henry IV, Part One\". This was Riverside's second \"First Folio Production\", mounted on a replica of Shakespeare's Globe Theater, constructed on the courtyard roof Prentise Hall at West 125th and Broadway, and transported and erected on the main campus Quad of Columbia University.\n\nThe cast featured Dan Southern as Hotspur and Jason Moehring as Hal, with Eric Hoffmann as Falstaff and William Hanauer as King Henry, and a cast of forty including Jim Brewster, Mary Skinner, Vit Horejs, David Murray Jaffe, Kathleen Monteleone, Jason Moehring, Julia Murray, Gay Reed, John Miller and Lois Tibbetts, with music by Deborah Awner played by a live orchestra.\n\nFor this production, the company built a replica of Shakespeare's Globe Theater outdoors, surrounded by trees on the southeast corner of the Columbia University Quad; the production was directed by W. Stuart McDowell and performed at night without microphones in this perfect acoustic environment, on a set designed and built by Dorian Vernacchio, costumes by Kenneth M. Yount, fight choreography for broadsword, halberd, dagger and mace, by Joel Leffert.\n\nThe reviewer of \"Show Business\", Ted Bank, noted that:\n\nRiverside Shakespeare Company has injected this chronicle history with all the pageantry and spectacle it calls for, and the result is exciting theatre... What makes \"Henry IV, Part One\" so delightful is that Riverside Shakespeare Company has taken pains to bring historical detail into the production. Going into its third season as New York's only year-round Shakespeare producer, Riverside has established a fine reputation for producing high-quality classic theatre.\"\n\nThe popularity of \"Henry IV, Part IV\" at Columbia University enabled the company to extend the run by remounting the entire production Off Broadway indoors at the American Theatre for Actors in midtown Manhattan in the fall of 1979.\n\nIn 1979 the Riverside Shakespeare Company mounted Niccolo Machiavelli's Renaissance farce, \"The Mandrake\", in the large second floor auditorium of the \"Casa Italiana\" of Columbia University located at West 117th and Amsterdam Avenue.\n\nThe \"Casa Italiana\", which had recently been designated by the Landmarks Preservation Commission, proved an ideal setting for production: Riverside's Florentine set was surrounded by the Florentine architecture, wrought iron chandeliers, and Italian antiques, some donated by Premier Benito Mussolini when the building was erected in 1926.\n\nPerforming in the style of Commedia dell'arte, with masks and fanciful commedia costumes, the cast included Arland Russell, Mark Cavalieri, Jeff Cameron, Tom Hanks, Susan Kay Logan, Perla Armanasco and Michael Goldner. In this production Tom Hanks played the lead role of the scoundrel Callimaco – in his first and only stage production in New York City until making his Broadway debut in Nora Ephron's \"Lucky Guy\" in spring 2013.\n\nThe production of \"The Mandrake\" was cast and rehearsed in the company's fourth floor facility of Columbia University's Prentise Hall in southern Harlem, and was directed by company member Dan Southern (then Daniel O. Smith), The production was played with authentic leather masks and fanciful costumes conceived and constructed by Broadway designer Jane Stein, period sets – including a raked checkerboard stage – designed and built by Gerard Bourcier, lighting (which incorporated the wrought iron chandeliers of the Casa Italiana) by John B. Forbes, and produced by Gloria Skurski and W. Stuart McDowell. In the \"Heights/Inwood Press of North Manhattan\" review of March 14, 1979, Jan Rucquoi noted that:\n\nA delightfully produced, fast-paced farce happened uptown on Columbia University's Campus, in the Casa Italiana... In \"The Mandrake\" the audience is often brought into the confidence of the actors who unmask themselves to do so.\n\nThe leather masks designed by Stein were often used inventively to comic effect, with actors sometimes removing them for an inner monologue, as in Hanks' portrayal of Callimaco, in which he conversed to himself while holding his quarter mask to one side.\n\n\"The Mandrake\" was accompanied by an original jazz score composed (and with a running improvised narration) by pianist-composer-orchestra leader Michael Wolff. According to the \"Heights/Inwood Press of North Manhattan\":\n\nThe music composed for the play had a Brechtian feel to it, enriching the play and setting the mood of high jinks and fun. Also, the fanciful costumes, works of art in themselves, with their overblown appliqued ornamentation, were a delightful asset to the production.\n\nThe production of \"The Mandrake\" opened on March 2, 1979 at the Casa Italiana, and was stage managed by Nancy Consentino Minckler and produced by W. Stuart McDowell and Gloria Skurski, in association with Columbia University.\n\nLater that year, the success of Riverside's production of \"The Mandrake\" enabled the company to remount the show with the company's new production of \"Much Ado About Nothing\" as a late night double bill in repertory at Manhattan Theatre Club's Stage 73. With the departure of Hanks to the west coast at the end of the run at the Casa Italiana, Dan Southern took over the role of Callimaco for the late night cabaret-like performances.\n\nSubsequent to its two indoor stagings, \"The Mandrake\" was revived for several outdoor engagements, performed on a two-wheel cart with simple cloth backdrop, beginning with the dedication of the \"Shakespeare Garden\" in the Brooklyn, hosted by Joseph Papp, Estelle Parsons and W. Stuart McDowell. The role of Callimaco was assumed by the play's director, Dan Southern. A small cart stage with canvas backdrop was used. The openness of staging, in natural sunlight and without the trappings and concealments of an indoor theatre, was typical of the performance style of \"Commedia dell'arte\", in which the audience members are constantly made aware of the artifice of the production, and thereby become participants in the theatrical event\n\nAs in the Riverside tradition of the \"Greenshow\", the production of \"The Mandrake\" – whether indoors or outside in a park – relied on broad physicalization, improvisation, and comic lazzi, as well as interacting with the audience in the manner of Commedia dell'arte. \"The Mandrake\", under Southern's direction, proved one of Riverside's most successful \"Commedia\" productions to date, and helped the company to realize its goal of bringing the work of Shakespeare, his contemporaries and Commedia dell'arte to as broad an audience as possible. It also helped to further the reputation of the company as a versatile classical theatre company in New York City.\n\nEarly in the summer of 1980, the Riverside Shakespeare Company moved into residence in West Park Presbyterian Church, at the corner of West 86th and Amsterdam, where it established The Shakespeare Center, dedicated to the year round training for the performance of the works of Shakespeare, his contemporaries, and Commedia dell'arte. Professional actor Andrew Achsen played a key role in securing the site in the church, of which he was a member, together with the pastor of West Park, Rev. Robert Davidson. The Theatre of The Shakespeare Center was reconstructed from materials from the demolition of Broadway's Helen Hayes Theatre and the set of Broadway's \"Nicholas Nickleby\" through funds raised by efforts of cast members from the Broadway production of \"Nicholas Nickleby\" from the Royal Shakespeare Company. The Shakespeare Center of the Riverside Shakespeare Company was officially dedicated in the fall of 1982 by Joseph Papp and Helen Hayes in a ceremony attended by Gloria Foster, Milo O'Shea, Barnard Hughes, Sam Waterston, Mildred Natwick, and Peter Brook. \nThe Shakespeare Center became the home for numerous Equity Riverside productions, beginning with \"Romeo and Juliet\" in 1980, directed by W. Stuart McDowell, assisted by Jay King, with Robert Walsh, Arleigh Richards, George House, Barbara Tirrell, Joe Meek, Gay Reed, Curtis Watkins, Dan Johnson, Obie Story, James McGuire, Jim Maxson, Christopher Cull, Timothy Oman, and, as the Nurse, Scottish folk singer and comedian Fredi Dundee.\n\n\"Romeo & Juliet\" was followed by \"Love's Labour's Lost\" with Freda Kavanagh, Deanna Deignan, Kay Colburn and Catherine Schmidt, and J. C. Hoyt, Timothy Doyle, Timothy Oman, Madeleine Potter, and Peter Siiteri, directed by Clingerman with music by Deborah Awner, which Mel Gussow of the \"New York Times\" called \"a charming chamber piece.\"\n\nThis was followed by a Commedia dell'arte production of \"Two Gentlemen of Verona\" directed by Dan Southern produced Off Broadway in the American Theatre for Actors, with music by Bob Rosen, with Ronald Lew Harris, Jim Maxson, Joe Meek, Amy Aquino, Allison Edwards, Dennis Pfister, and J. C. Hoit.\n\nWhile the company produced a subscription season in 1980–1981 at The Shakespeare Center, it also mounted a series of free performances of Shakespeare plays and scenes across town at the Citicorp Center, entitled \"Riverside Shakespeare Salutes Shakespeare at Citicorp\", which included \"The Taming of the Shrew\" directed by Jere O'Donnell, \"Love's Labour's Lost\" directed by Timothy Minor, \"The Will to Power: Scenes of Ambition and Political Intrigue\", directed by Ken Grantham, and a popular compilation of romantic scenes from the Bard, \"This Bud of Love: Scenes of Awakening Love\", directed by John Clingerman. These were also broadcast on New York's public radio station, WBAI.\n\nMeanwhile at \"The Shakespeare Center\", the company opened its next season with \"Henry V\" directed by Timothy Oman, assisted by Linda Mason, associate director, and Maureen Clarke, Riverside's resident text coach, with music by Sanchie Borrow, scenic and lighting design by Norbert U. Kolb, fight direction by Conal O'Brien, and costumes by David Pearson, featuring Frank Muller and Lee Croghan, with Dene Nardi, Norma Fire, Ronald Lew Harris, Pat Kennerly, Gay Reed, and Gene Santarelli.\n\nIn February 1981 the company mounted the New York Premiere of the Commedia dell'arte farce \"The Three Cuckolds\" with Perla Armanasco, Jim Brewster, Ronald Lew Harris, David Murray Jaffe, Joe Meek, Jim Maxson, and Jane Badgers, Lloyd Davis, Jr. (as an \"outstanding\" Arlecchino), Oded Carmi and Marla Buck, directed by Dan Southern with an original score by Michael Canick, sepia drops depicting contemporary New York street scenes by Dorian Vernacchio costumes by Barbara Weiss and masks by Paul Mantell, about which Marilyn Stasio of the \"New York Post\" wrote:\n\nThe resident company under Daniel O. Smith's stage direction, has enthusiastically caught the outrageous spirit of that venerable theater form... The stock characters of \"commedia\" – from the bulbous-nosed clowns, the \"zanni\", to that nimble trickster Arlecchino – are all authentically masked, padded and caricatured. And the cast's high level of comic energy makes them perfectly ridiculous... In keeping with the improvisational tradition of \"commedia\", the production injects a contemporary tone into the material ... including a graffiti mural, which is wittier than the stuff you read on the IRT. And somebody tossed off a Nancy Reagan joke that tickled me.\n\nThe production of \"The Three Cuckolds\" was performed in a broad farcical style with numerous contemporary references, and extensive use of acrobatics, such as a backflip performed by Jim Brewster on his entrance as the young lover. \"The Three Cuckolds\" proved so popular, that it was later mounted as an Off Broadway touring production, and was the first Riverside production seen by Joseph Papp, leading eventually to an ongoing sponsorship by the New York Shakespeare Festival beginning with \"Edward II\" (see below), and subsequent Riverside summer touring productions.\n\nBeginning in 1982 Joseph Papp and the New York Shakespeare Festival became the principal sponsors of the company, starting with the Riverside Shakespeare Company's production of the New York Premiere of Bertolt Brecht's adaptation of Christopher Marlowe's \"The Life of Edward II of England\" in 1982, also sponsored by the Goethe House of New York, and by Marta Feuchtwanger (widow of Brecht's acknowledged co-author Lion Feuchtwanger).\n\nThe New York premiere of \"Edward II\" was grounded on interviews McDowell had made in Germany with cast members – Erwin Faber and Hans Schweikart – of the original Munich production of 1924, which had been Brecht's debut as stage director. In the original 1924 production, Brecht developed many of his \"new staging and dramaturgical techniques\" for what came to be known as epic theatre, and which eventually profoundly impacted 20th century theatre. Elements from Brecht's original production became a springboard for interpreting the script, seventy-eight years later.\n\nThe Riverside Shakespeare production featured an original score composed by Michael Canick for percussion and played by percussionist Noel Council above and to the side of the audience in the side tower that had been erected within the theatre of The Shakespeare Center of the newly renovated theatre. The score made use of snare and kettledrums, of xylophones and castanets, as well as natural percussion sounds made by the cast, using rattles and hand-held pea-pods played during the transitions between scenes, all intended to give an environment of sound intended to augment and draw focus to various narrative lines throughout the production.\nThe Riverside production of \"Edward II\" featured Dan Southern and Timothy Oman in the roles of Gaveston and King Edward, with Andrew Achsen, Larry Attille, Christopher Cull, Michael Franks, Margo Gruber, Dan Johnson, Joe Meek, Jason Moehring, Gay Reed, Count Stovall, Patrick Sullivan and Jeffery V. Thompson, directed by McDowell, with assistant director Jeannie H. Woods, with sets and lights by Dorian Vernacchio, costumes by David Robinson, with hand-hewn wooden props designed and built by Valerie Kuehn.\n\nAccording to singer/writer William Warfield:\n\nI've never seen a classical theatre production by this company before, and I thought it was truly exceptional. As unimpassioned as most so-called entertainment is, the only saving grace is that artists still band together on honest endeavors, such as this... \"Edward II\" was brilliant. \"Edward II\" was visually stunning, and imaginatively directed production of a play that has great relevance today.\n\nOpening night, a special panel of scholars on German theatre and the drama of the Weimar Republic in particular was presented in the theatre before the play, including a display of photos from the original Munich production. In keeping with Brecht's original production, a \"Weimar Cabaret\" followed the production, with cast member Andrew Achsen serving as host.\n\nThe next season (1982–1983) in the newly renovated theatre on West 86th Street began with \"Richard III\", about which Marilyn Stasio of \"The New York Post\" wrote:\n\nThe Riverside Shakespeare Company has opened its season with a \"Richard III\" that handsomely advances its suit for support as a year-round professional Shakespeare ensemble worth taking seriously. The production has been mounted in observance of the 500th anniversary of that infamous monarch's feverish rise to power. J. Kenneth Campbell makes his entrance hump-first, from an obviously symbolic hole in the ground, and grabs us from the moment he launches into his wintry discontents. Campbell not only loves his character, he loves his \"words\", articulating with the lusty relish of a voluptuary set loose in a seraglio. It's a joy to watch him.\n\n\"Richard III\" was directed by John Clingerman, with an original musical score by Joe Church played by the \"New York City Brass Quintet\" and large chorus recorded especially for this production, about which \"Backstage\" wrote, \"Particular mention should be made of the music, conducted by Joseph Church with the New York City Brass Quintet and a large chorus contributed to the fifteenth century ambience and aided in unifying the production.\".\n\nThe production featured stage and screen veteran J. Kenneth Campbell in the title role, Marya Lowery, Richard Hoyt-Miller, Scott Parson, Maggie Scott, Mary McTigue, and Ann Ducati, sets by Tom Newman, costumes by Randolf Pearson, lighting by Richard Lund, extensive combat choreography by Joel Leffert, and stage managed by Mary Ellen Allison.\n\nIn early 1983, Riverside Shakespeare Company mounted its third \"First Folio Production\", an uncut staging of \"The Winter's Tale\", with Eric Hoffmann as Autolycus and Tony Award-winning actress Tonya Pinkins in her New York stage debut as \"Mopsa – a shepherdess\", with Marya Lowry and Timothy Oman as Hermione and Leontes, C. B. Anderson, Franklin Brown, Sally Kay Brown, Lee Croghan, Christopher Cull, Virginia Downing, Freda Kavanaugh, Beatrix Porter, and Richie Devaney. The production was directed by W. Stuart McDowell, with costumes by Randolph Pearson, original music by Joseph Church, choreography by Beatrix Porter, text coaching by Maureen Clarke, and was stage managed by Mary Ellen Allison.\n\nThe production combined modern (Grace Kelly's Monaco) and historical (pastoral 18th century England) periods in a concept centered around a magical transformation that takes place when Mamillius begins to recount \"the winter's tale\" to his mother, Hermione. The concept arose from the moment in the \"First Folio\" text when Mamillius is asked to \"tell's a Tale,\" to which the boy responds with \"There was a man ... dwelt by a Church-yard...\"\n\nAccording to the Riverside program, McDowell's interpretation posited that these eight words – the entirety of \"the winter's tale\" – are nothing less than a prophecy concerning Leontes, Mamillius' father, who would some day virtually dwell by a graveyard, mourning the passing of Hermione and Mamillius (Act III, Sc. ii. Leontes: \"Once a day I'll visit/The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there/Shall be my recreation...\") – whose deaths he causes in the subsequent parable told by Mamillius. Both Hermione and story-teller Mamillius (who also played the role of Time in the Riverside production) are resurrected magically at the play's end, as his \"sad tale...best for Winter\" draws to a conclusion, and the purpose of the lad's tale has been fulfilled.\n\nDuring rehearsals for \"The Winter's Tale\" the company was virtually stranded in the theatre during the blizzard that hit New York City in mid-February 1983. The technical crew building the set had to spend the night in The Shakespeare Center, marooned there while they finished the elaborate, magical stage for production. Fortunately, the deli just outside the theatre – Barney Greengrass: \"the Sturgeon King\" – was open the next day, providing the crew with bagels and coffee in the morning. Shakespeare's tale of Winter proved a fitting production for New York's year-round Shakespeare company to be socked in while the city nearly ground to a halt.\n\nAfter the opening on February 24, Riverside's \"The Winter's Tale\" was broadcast on New York's WBAI, before which it was described as, \"An exceptional production of one of the Bard's seldom-produced scripts...brilliant.\" In the \"New York Shakespeare Bulletin\" it was observed that \"Riverside's responsible rendering of the text should win them a \"Julio Romano\" statue that will never walk away.\"\n\nLater that year the company mounted \"Taming of the Shrew\" in 1983 directed by Robert Mooney with music by Joseph Church and set designs by Kevin Lee Allen, with Diane Ciesla and Dan Southern, and Ronald Lew Harris, Eric Hoffmann, Joe Meek, and Robert Mooney. About this production, Sy Isenberg of \"Bulletin of the New York Shakespeare Society\" wrote:\n\nThis production of \"The Taming of the Shrew\" really cares...I cannot think of a piece in recent memory that has been so deliciously cast. The whole cast is swimmingly on their toes. As the primary lovers not meant for each other Diane Ciesla and Daniel Southern are dazzling...The couple's subsequent extravagances are part of a complicated mating dance at once witty, slapstick and tender, balanced at the end between ritual and reality. In its warmth, elegance and festivity, this \"Kate\" kisses us all.\n\nThe next season opened with a full stage production of \"The Tempest\" with Bertram Ross – longtime leading dance partner with Martha Graham and co-director of the Graham dance company – as Prospero, and featuring Eric Hoffmann, Ronald Lew Harris, Joe Meek, Kathleen Bishop, Ellen Cleghorne, Alexander Cook, Herman Petras, John Reese, and Laurine Towler as Ariel, directed by Robert Mooney, with dance choreography by Shela Xoregos set to music by Joe Church, and sets by Kevin Lee Allen. Bertram Ross, who has been called the \"dance legend and archetype male Graham dancer\", used his considerable dance experience and technique and deep voice to create a memorable Prospero, using movement choreographed by Xoregos, who molded Prospero and Ariel into a \"moving duo of poetic form.\"\n\nIn 1984 the company presented a modern dress version of \"Julius Caesar\", entitled \"CAESAR!\" set in contemporary Washington, directed by McDowell, inspired by interviews conducted with company members of Orson Welles's famous 1937 Broadway production of \"Caesar\", with set by Kevin Lee Allen, with Assistant Director Maureen Clarke and Jane Badgers, director of marketing & P.R, and featuring music by Michael Canick.\n\nThe production featured Obie Award–winner Harold Scott, and Marya Lowry, with Michael Cook, Andy Achsen, Ronald Lew Harris, Paul Hebron, Sonja Lanzener, Jim Maxson, Joe Meek, Robert Walsh and Herman Petras as Caesar.\n\nThe production proved immensely popular with audiences, setting, as it did, Shakespeare's play in contemporary Washington, D.C. in a country on the verge of making its popular leader president for life. The production of \"CAESAR\", revised, was subsequently optioned by Samuel H. Scripps for a Broadway production at the Virginia Theatre, scheduled to premiere on the 50th anniversary of the Mercury Theatre production, on November 11, 1987.\n\nThe slogan for the production was reflected on its poster:\n\n\"It's America.\"\n\"It's 1984.\"\n\"It's the political horror show for our times.\"\n\nResponding to the production, Sy Syna of \"The New York Tribune\" wrote: \"Riverside's \"CAESAR!\" is not only a rock solid production, it is surprisingly a good one.\" Reviewing the Riverside production, Herbert Mitgang of the \"New York Times\" wrote:\n\nThe famous Mercury Theater production of \"Julius Caesar\" in modern dress staged by Orson Welles in 1937 was designed to make audiences think of Mussolini's Blackshirts – and it did. The Riverside Shakespeare Company's lively production makes you think of timeless ambition and anti-libertarians anywhere.\n\nIn 1985 the Riverside Shakespeare Company presented the New York premiere of \"The History of King Lear\", adapted with a happy ending by 18th-century English Poet Laureate, Nahum Tate, from William Shakespeare's \"King Lear\". The production was directed by W. Stuart McDowell, produced by Andrew B. Harris, who had joined Riverside as its executive director at the beginning of the season.\n\nThe production featured a complete, original score for harpsichord and orchestra by John Aschenbrenner, fights choreographed by Richard Raether, lighting by Sam Scripps, and a period wind machine in the wings. The Riverside production displayed a harpsichord to one side, as if in the wings, and a wind machine to the other – both visible to the audience.\n\nTate's adaptation of \"The History of King Lear\", which restored the authentic legend of the ancient king, was written without a Fool, added a confidante and a romance for Cordelia and Edgar, and culminated with the triumph of good over evil with the restoration of Lear to the throne with Kent and Gloucester at his side, and the marriage of Cordelia to Edgar. \n\nLike Tate's other immensely popular \"happy ending\" version of \"Romeo and Juliet\" (which was a central part of the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of \"Nicholas Nickleby\") Tate's equally popular adaptation of Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" was the only performed version of \"King Lear\" for over 150 years, beginning in the late 17th century when Tate wrote his adaptation, through the early 19th century.\n\nRiverside mounted this historical piece in an 18th-century setting, with authentic period costumes by Ellen Seeling on a set designed by Norbert Kolb. The production featured Barbara Tirrell, Frank Muller and Margo Gruber as Goneril, Edmund and Regan, with Eric Hoffmann as Lear, Dan Daily as Kent, Freda Kavanagh as Cordelia, Don Fischer as Edgard, and Saunder Finard, Sandra Protor Gray, Buck Hobbs, E. F. Morrill, Gene Santarelli, and Richard Willis.\n\nThe reviewer for \"The New York City Tribune\" wrote:\n\nThe Riverside Shakespeare production of \"The History of King Lear\" includes a raked stage designed by Norbert Kolb, gorgeous costumes by Ellen Seeling, a visible stage hand operating the wind machine and handing on props, a maestro conducting John Aschenbrenner's lively score composed mostly for harpsichord with several interpolated songs including one by Garrick, and a whole panoply of 18th century theater devices, including a hysterical use of tableaux to open and close scenes, and hilarious asides including one when Edmund (deliciously played by Frank Muller) is hard at it with one of the rival sisters... Shakespearean adaptations occur in any era. This one, besides putting a leer in \"Lear\" was a helluva lot of fun!\n\nIn 1982, Riverside Shakespeare Company began a series of expanded tours of Free Summer Shakespeare made possible through sponsorship by Joseph Papp and the New York Shakespeare Festival. These were all produced under an Off Broadway contract with the Actors' Equity Association, and, with broadened marketing, proved exceedingly popular with audiences at these extended venues.\n\nThe first of these was a tour – to twelve different parks in four boroughs – of Shakespeare's raucous \"A Comedy of Errors\" directed by Gloria Skurski, with costumes by Barbara Weiss, on a touring set designed by Dorian Vernacchio. The cast featured Connor Smith and Andrew Achsen, and Ronald Lew Harris, Karen Jackson, Dan Johnson, Erin Lanagan, Trip Plymale, Mel Winkler and Dan Woods. The production featured a magician, a belly dancer accompanied by a lively percussion score composed and played by Michael Canick, and a very broad comedic performance style that proved extremely popular with its audiences. Opening night Joseph Papp arrived with an enormous basket of fruit for the cast to thank them for their performance in 90 degree heat.\n\nThe following summer the company mounted a music-filled production of \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" set in old, post-Civil War New Orleans and directed by Timothy Oman, with Maureen Clarke as assistant director, featuring ragtime music by Deena Kaye. The cast featured Anna Deavere Smith in her New York stage debut playing Mistress Quickly as a \"Cajun voodoo woman\" and Joseph Reed as Falstaff, with Douglas Broyles, Dan Daily, Norma Fire, Paul Hebron, Michael Landsman, Sonja Lanzener, Warren Sweeney, Shelly Desai, and stage managed by Mary Ellen Allison.\n\nIn the hands of composer and keyboard player Deena Kaye, the Riverside production of \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" verged on becoming a full-fledged musical, with numerous tunes played by the ragtime band. According to Nan Robertson in \"The New York Times\":\n\nAn eight piece ragtime band and Mardi Gras high jinks underscored the slapstick performance, which sometimes evoked the spastic look and ricky-tick musical accompaniment of a very early silent flicker movie. The cast is costumed as 19th-century Southern belles, beaux and bums, the last group being the disreputable lecherous but appealing Falstaff. During the intermission, a barroom quartet singing \"A Woman is only a Woman, but a Good Cigar is a Smoke\" brought down the house... This is the second season under the aegis of Joseph Papp... The company is now calling its production of \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" an \"evening with the Basin Street Bard.\"\n\nClive Barnes, in his first review of a Riverside Shakespeare production, wrote in the \"New York Post\":\n\nThe Riverside Shakespeare owes its name to the fact that it started operations in Riverside Park, so it was a sort of homecoming for them when I caught the company in a glade in that park just by 82nd Street...The production is modern and carefree – the kind of innovative Shakespeare that [Joseph] Papp himself favors, and appropriate for a bright summer evening, with people squatting on the grass, many of them enjoying an alfresco picnic. Director Timothy Oman has placed the play in New Orleans soon after the Civil War. The idea works quite well. The play is preceded by a sort of Mardi Gras revel, and in the intermission we are regaled with a few vaudeville songs of the period, including a somewhat odd barbershop quartet... This is one of the most purely farcical of Shakespeare's plays, and it stands up well to the present knockabout, roustabout treatment it receives from these Riverside players.\n\nFor each of these summer tours sponsored by Joseph Papp and the New York Shakespeare Festival, the traditional \"Greenshow\" performed before each outdoor touring production—which involved live musicians and the entire cast often performing Commedia-like spoofs of the performance to follow – became the festive call of the audience to the stage, and an important part of Riverside's performance tradition.\n\nThe next summer, in 1984, the Riverside Shakespeare Company mounted a summer parks tour of its third production of \"Romeo and Juliet\" directed by John Clingerman with music by Michael Roth played by percussionist David Nicholson, fight choreography by Robert Walsh, on a set designed by Kevin Lee Allen and costumes by Cecilia A. Frederichs, with Michael Golding, Constance Boardman, Saul Stein, Todd Jamieson and Jeff Shoemaker.\n\nFor this production, the company secured $15,000 from New York Telephone to overhaul the mobile stage that been used by the New York Shakespeare Festival for parks tours before the NYSF stopped touring four years before. According to \"Newsday\":\n\nThe long unit resembles a commercial vehicle that might transport a large household across the country. It takes six stagehands using hydraulic lift and plenty of muscle, several hours to rig the contents into the Verona of Shakespeare's love-stricken youth... \"It's sunset Shakespeare\", said W. Stuart McDowell, the Riverside's artistic director, \"designed to be performed in natural light the way it was in Shakespeare's time.\"\n\nThe production opened at the Bandshell in New York's Central Park to an audience estimated at over a thousand (according to \"Newsday\"). This was the first time Riverside Shakespeare Company had ventured into New York's Central Park – the traditional territory of the New York Shakespeare Festival. Opening on June 6, 1984 saw a \"Gala Benefit\" hosted by Lucille Lortel, Richard Horner and Lynne Stuart. Opening night, Joseph Papp joined W. Stuart McDowell on the touring stage, and inaugurated the five borough tour in a special ceremony in which Mr. Papp compared Riverside's tour with the former tours of the NYSF:\n\nThey're a marvelous bunch of actors. And they have what it takes for this sort of thing—They carry things on their backs...We used to make deals with local gangs. One time I remember well. I told this kid that he had to move because he was backstage. He said to me, \"This ain't backstage; it's first base!\"\n\nThe old mobile unit could not withstand the rigors of a month-long, outdoor tour of transporting \"fair Verona\" to the five boroughs of New York City. The second weekend, the long mobile unit dropped its rear axle at the intersection of 42nd and 9th while the truck was crossing midtown Manhattan. The mobile unit had to be permanently retired, but the tour continued with select pieces of scenery, such as Juliet's balcony, and the production continued to play to exceptionally large audiences across the five boroughs.\n\nIn 1985, the company mounted a very Italian version of \"The Taming of the Shrew\" with music by Frank Lindquist, and a set design by Kevin Lee Allen and costumes by Howard Behar, with Norma Fire, Paul Hebron, Sonja Lanzener, David Adamson, Paul Hebron, Vincent Niemann, Gene Santarelli, Laurine Towler, Joseph Reed, Michael Preston, and David Carlyon, who was also Clown Master. It was directed by Maureen Clarke, who during these years had been serving as Resident Text Coach for the company. Opening night was rained-out – a condition surprisingly encountered by Riverside tours only infrequently; the opening night performance was played in the main sanctuary of West Park Presbyterian Church. \"Shrew\" then went on to tour all five boroughs in blazing heat, attracting large audiences for this lively show.\n\nTo train actors, directors, and teachers in the performance of the classic text of Shakespeare and his contemporaries, the company began its professional training program, The Riverside School for Shakespeare, in the fall of 1980, at The Shakespeare Center, headed by John Clingerman.\n\nActor training classes were offered by company members with professional performance experience and training in the classics: in verse, stage combat, movement and Commedia dell'arte. Among the teaching staff were Marya Lowery, Robert Walsh, Maureen Clarke, Eric Hoffmann, Joel Leffert, John Carroll, Robert Mooney, Peter Siiteri, Dan Southern and Timothy Oman. Numerous special guests offered workshops, such as Raúl Juliá, Barnard Hughes, Roger Rees, and Paul Rogers.\n\nThe Riverside Shakespeare Company also began to host residencies for actor training with verse by noted Shakespeare teachers Cicely Berry (in her first such workshops in New York City), and Patrick Tucker from the Royal Shakespeare Company for training American actors in use of Shakespeare's First Folio as a cornerstone of professional stage performance.\n\nAccording to \"Backstage\":\n\nInitiated in the fall of 1980, The Riverside School for Shakespeare has been expanded to train actors in areas of Renaissance language, thought, movement as well as stage combat and other Renaissance performance styles, focusing on the preparation of the serious professional actor for the performance of Shakespearean and other Renaissance dramas. The RSC actor training program has been set up by RSC's Artistic Director, W. Stuart McDowell, and by the program's director, John Clingerman. The courses will cover the breadth of Renaissance stage acting, offered by a staff of instructors with professional experience gained through work with the only Shakespeare company performing year-round in N.Y.C.\n\nIt has been acknowledged (in the Introduction to first popular paperback reissue of Shakespeare's First Folio) that Patrick Tucker's intensive workshops first produced in New York by the Riverside Shakespeare Company in 1982 lead to a resurgence of interest in the First Folio by actors, teachers and directors in New York City, and to an awakening to the possibilities of playing Shakespeare from cue scripts, eventually leading to the popular reissue of Folio texts now widely used in this country.\n\nIn October 1983, the Riverside Shakespeare Company launched The Shakespeare Project, New York City's first major residency of actors from the Royal Shakespeare Company – with Edwin Richfield (of the RSC's highly acclaimed \"The Greeks\"), Heather Canning (of Paul Scofield's \"Macbeth\"), Christopher Ravenscroft (from the Royal Shakespeare Company's \"Nicholas Nickleby\", Jennie Stoller and John Kane (the later two from Peter Brook's landmark production of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\") – conducting workshops and seminars and performing \"The Merchant of Venice\", Dylan Thomas' \"Under Milk Wood\", and the New York premiere of D. H. Lawrence's \"The Tarnished Phoenix\", with a host committee of Henry Guettel, Leonard Bernstein, José Ferrer, Helen Hayes, Bernard Hughes, Bernard Jacobs, John V. Lindsay, Joshua Logan, and George Plimpton.\n\nAs Christopher Ravenscroft said on opening night of The Shakespeare Project, \"I would really like to tell the Americans that they already have the talent and the technique. All they need is the practice to take the horror out of Shakespeare.\"\n\nDuring these years, the Riverside Shakespeare Company and The Shakespeare Center gained support from numerous major benefits staged for the theatre company by Jeremy Irons, Sinéad Cusack, Roger Rees, Nicol Williamson, Andre Gregory, Raúl Juliá, Jim Dale, and by Tony Award-nominee Edward Petherbridge, (from the Royal Shakespeare Company's \"Nicholas Nickleby\") in his one-person show, \"Acting Natural\". In the early 1980s, Riverside's board of directors was headed by Judith Radasch, followed by Donna Lindsay-Goodwin. Riverside's Advisory Board during this period included Shakespeare scholars Dr. Marvin Rosenberg and Dr. Bernard Beckerman, as well as noted stage directors and actors Zoe Caldwell, José Ferrer, Ruth Gordon, Helen Hayes, John Hirsch, Barnard Hughes, Mary Beth Hurt, Raúl Juliá, Garson Kannin, Stacey Keach, Joshua Logan, Mildred Natwick, Trevor Nunn, Roger Rees, Milo O'Shea, Sam Waterston and Joanne Woodward.\n\nIn 1985, Helen Hayes appeared in an all-star benefit performance for the Riverside Shakespeare Company of Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol\", with Miss Hayes in her return to the New York stage as Narrator, featuring Len Cariou as Scrooge, Bille Brown of the Royal Shakespeare Company, MacIntyre Dixon, Celeste Holm, Raúl Juliá, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Harold Scott, Carole Shelley, and Fritz Weaver, staged with an original score for the Brass Quintet by W. Stuart McDowell, sung by the Children's Choir from the Anglo-American School of Manhattan, and an original script by Bille Brown, at the Symphony Space on the Upper Westside of Manhattan.\n\nIn 1986 the popular benefit presentation of \"A Christmas Carol\" was remounted, again with Helen Hayes, at the Marquis Theatre on Broadway, featuring F. Murray Abraham as Scrooge, with Ossie Davis, June Havoc, Rex Smith, Jean Marsh, MacIntyre Dixon, Alec Baldwin, and the choir of the Anglo-American School, produced by McDowell and directed by Robert Small.\n\nW. Stuart McDowell left Riverside in 1986 to found McDowell/Scripps Productions with arts benefactor, Samuel H. Scripps, and is now Chair of the Department of Theatre Dance and Motion Pictures at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio. Gloria Skurski went on to a career in television, joining the staff of CBS News as Associate Producer in 1984, and is now director of educational and broadcast services for PBS ThinkTV of Dayton Ohio.\n\nBeginning in 1986, the Riverside Shakespeare Company was led by Robert Small, followed by Timothy W. Oman, who moved the company to permanent Off Broadway status at Playhouse 91, located on East 91st Street on the upper Eastside of Manhattan, where it was subsequently led by Gus Kaikkonen. In its second decade, until it disbanded in 1997, the Riverside Shakespeare Company produced a number of shows with distinguished actors and directors such as Henderson Forsythe, Beth Fowler, David Edward Jones, Charles Keating, Laurie Kennedy, Robert Sean Leonard, Stephen McHattie, Austin Pendleton, and Stuart Vaughan.\n\nDuring its fifteenth year, the theatre company was praised in the weekly publication \"The Nation\" for producing \"the most dependably accomplished performances of Shakespeare's plays regularly available in New York City.\"\n\nIn its twenty years of work as a theatre and educational training center, the Riverside Shakespeare Company presented over one hundred Equity productions, benefits and radio broadcasts of works by Shakespeare, Marlowe, Brecht, Machiavelli, and Shaw, as well as premieres of plays and Commedia dell'arte scenari. Its educational programs provided training for hundreds of actors, directors and teachers and students. Over its two decades Riverside productions were seen and heard by over one hundred thousand people throughout the five boroughs of New York City.\n\nOn March 24, 2008, the first annual reunion of former Riverside Shakespeare Company actors, directors, composers, and designers was held at the Marriott Marquis, in New York City.\n\nPresent at the reunion were company members Kevin Lee Allen, Kieron Murphy, Scott Parson, Jim Maxson, Gloria Skurski, Margo Gruber, W. Stuart McDowell, Michael Canick, Andrew Achsen, Herman Petras, Robert Mooney, Eric Hoffmann, and Dan Southern (aka Dan Smith).\n\nAlso present were Lisa Graham Parson, Pedro Ruiz, Cindy Ratzlaff, Charles Borkas, and photographer Claire McDowell.\n\n"}
{"id": "62034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62034", "title": "Simone de Beauvoir", "text": "Simone de Beauvoir\n\nSimone Lucie Ernestine Marie Bertrand de Beauvoir (; ; 9 January 1908 – 14 April 1986) was a French writer, intellectual, existentialist philosopher, political activist, feminist and social theorist. Though she did not consider herself a philosopher, she had a significant influence on both feminist existentialism and feminist theory.\n\nDe Beauvoir wrote novels, essays, biographies, autobiography and monographs on philosophy, politics and social issues. She was known for her 1949 treatise \"The Second Sex\", a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary feminism; and for her novels, including \"She Came to Stay\" and \"The Mandarins\". She was also known for her lifelong relationship with French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre.\n\nSimone de Beauvoir was born in Paris on 9 January 1908. Her parents were Georges Bertrand de Beauvoir, a legal secretary who once aspired to be an actor, and Françoise de Beauvoir (née Brasseur), a wealthy banker's daughter and devout Catholic. Simone's sister, Hélène, was born two years later. The family struggled to maintain their bourgeois status after losing much of their fortune shortly after World War I, and Françoise insisted that the two daughters be sent to a prestigious convent school. De Beauvoir herself was deeply religious as a child, at one point intending to become a nun. She lost her faith in her early teens and remained an atheist for the rest of her life.\n\nDe Beauvoir was intellectually precocious, fuelled by her father's encouragement; he reportedly would boast, \"Simone thinks like a man!\" Because of her family's straitened circumstances, de Beauvoir could no longer rely on her dowry, and like other middle-class girls of her age, her marriage opportunities were put at risk. De Beauvoir took this opportunity to do what she always wanted to do while also taking steps to earn a living for herself.\n\nAfter passing baccalaureate exams in mathematics and philosophy in 1925, she studied mathematics at the Institut Catholique de Paris and literature/languages at the . She then studied philosophy at the Sorbonne and after completing her degree in 1928, she wrote her \"\" (roughly equivalent to an MA thesis) on Leibniz for Léon Brunschvicg (the topic was \"Le concept chez Leibniz\" [\"The Concept in Leibniz\"]). De Beauvoir was only the ninth woman to have received a degree from the Sorbonne at the time, due to the fact that French women had only recently been allowed to join higher education.\n\nDe Beauvoir first worked with Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Claude Lévi-Strauss, when all three completed their practice teaching requirements at the same secondary school. Although not officially enrolled, she sat in on courses at the École Normale Supérieure in preparation for the \"agrégation\" in philosophy, a highly competitive postgraduate examination which serves as a national ranking of students. It was while studying for the \"agrégation\" that she met \"École Normale\" students Jean-Paul Sartre, Paul Nizan, and René Maheu (who gave her the lasting nickname \"Castor\", or beaver). The jury for the \"agrégation\" narrowly awarded Sartre first place instead of de Beauvoir, who placed second and, at age 21, was the youngest person ever to pass the exam.\n\nWriting of her youth in \"Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter\" she said:\n\"...my father's individualism and pagan ethical standards were in complete contrast to the rigidly moral conventionalism of my mother's teaching. This disequilibrium, which made my life a kind of endless disputation, is the main reason why I became an intellectual.\"\n\nFrom 1929 to 1943, de Beauvoir taught at the lycée level until she could support herself solely on the earnings of her writings. She taught at the (Marseille), the , the (1936–39).\n\nDuring October 1929, Jean-Paul Sartre and de Beauvoir became a couple and, after they were confronted by her father, Sartre asked her to marry him. One day while they were sitting on a bench outside the Louvre, he said, \"Let's sign a two-year lease\". Near the end of her life, de Beauvoir said, \"Marriage was impossible. I had no dowry.\" So they entered a lifelong relationship.\n\nSartre and de Beauvoir always read each other's work. Debate continues about the extent to which they influenced each other in their existentialist works, such as Sartre's \"Being and Nothingness\" and de Beauvoir's \"She Came to Stay\" and \"Phenomenology and Intent\". However, recent studies of de Beauvoir's work focus on influences other than Sartre, including Hegel and Leibniz. The Neo-Hegelian revival led by Alexandre Kojève and Jean Hyppolite in the 1930s inspired a whole generation of French thinkers, including Beauvoir and Sartre, to discover Hegel's \"Phenomenology of Spirit\".\n\nBeginning in 1929, de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre were partners for fifty-one years until his death in 1980. De Beauvoir chose never to marry or set up a joint household and she never had children. This gave her the time to advance her education and engage in political causes, to write and teach, and to have lovers.\n\nPerhaps her most famous lover was American author Nelson Algren whom she met in Chicago in 1947, and to whom she wrote across the Atlantic as \"my beloved husband.\" Algren won the National Book Award for \"The Man with the Golden Arm\" in 1950, and in 1954, de Beauvoir won France's most prestigious literary prize for \"The Mandarins\" in which Algren is the character Lewis Brogan. Algren vociferously objected to their intimacy becoming public. Years after they separated, she was buried wearing his gift of a silver ring. However, she lived with Claude Lanzmann from 1952 to 1959.\n\nDe Beauvoir was bisexual and her relationships with young women were controversial. Former student Bianca Lamblin (originally Bianca Bienenfeld) wrote in her book \"Mémoires d'une jeune fille dérangée\" (English: \"Memoirs of a Disturbed Young Lady\"), that, while she was a student at Lycée Molière, she had been sexually exploited by her teacher de Beauvoir, who was in her 30s at the time. In 1943, de Beauvoir was suspended from her teaching job, due to an accusation that she had seduced her 17-year-old lycée pupil Natalie Sorokine in 1939. Sorokine's parents laid formal charges against de Beauvoir for debauching a minor and as a result she had her license to teach in France permanently revoked.\n\nIn 1977, de Beauvoir, Sartre, Roland Barthes, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida and much of the era's intelligentsia signed a petition seeking to abrogate the age of consent in France.\n\nDe Beauvoir published her first novel \"She Came to Stay\" in 1943. It is a fictionalised chronicle of her and Sartre's sexual relationship with Olga Kosakiewicz and Wanda Kosakiewicz. Olga was one of her students in the Rouen secondary school where de Beauvoir taught during the early 1930s. She grew fond of Olga. Sartre tried to pursue Olga but she rejected him, so he began a relationship with her sister Wanda. Upon his death, Sartre was still supporting Wanda. He also supported Olga for years, until she met and married Jacques-Laurent Bost, a lover of de Beauvoir.\n\nIn the novel, set just before the outbreak of World War II, de Beauvoir creates one character from the complex relationships of Olga and Wanda. The fictionalised versions of Beauvoir and Sartre have a ménage à trois with the young woman. The novel also delves into de Beauvoir and Sartre's complex relationship and how it was affected by the ménage à trois.\n\n\"She Came to Stay\" was followed by many others, including \"The Blood of Others\", which explores the nature of individual responsibility, telling a love story between two young French students participating in the Resistance in World War II.\n\nIn 1944 de Beauvoir wrote her first philosophical essay, \"Pyrrhus et Cinéas\", a discussion of an existentialist ethics. She continued her exploration of existentialism through her second essay \"The Ethics of Ambiguity\" (1947); it is perhaps the most accessible entry into French existentialism. In the essay, de Beauvoir clears up some inconsistencies that many, Sartre included, have found in major existentialist works such as \"Being and Nothingness\". In \"The Ethics of Ambiguity\", de Beauvoir confronts the existentialist dilemma of absolute freedom vs. the constraints of circumstance.\n\nAt the end of World War II, de Beauvoir and Sartre edited \"Les Temps modernes\", a political journal which Sartre founded along with Maurice Merleau-Ponty and others. De Beauvoir used \"Les Temps Modernes\" to promote her own work and explore her ideas on a small scale before fashioning essays and books. De Beauvoir remained an editor until her death.\n\n\"The Second Sex\", first published in 1949 in French as \"Le Deuxième Sexe\", turns the existentialist mantra that \"existence precedes essence\" into a feminist one: \"One is not born but becomes a woman\". With this famous phrase, Beauvoir first articulated what has come to be known as the sex-gender distinction, that is, the distinction between biological sex and the social and historical construction of gender and its attendant stereotypes. \"The fundamental source of women's oppression\" Beauvoir notes, \"is its historical and social construction as the quintessential\" Other.\n\nDe Beauvoir defines women as the \"second sex\" because women are defined in relation to men. Aristotle referred that women are \"female by virtue of a certain lack of qualities\". De Beauvoir also points out that St. Thomas referred to the woman as the \"imperfect man\", the \"incidental\" being. De Beauvoir asserted that women are as capable of choice as men, and thus can choose to elevate themselves, moving beyond the 'immanence' to which they were previously resigned and reaching 'transcendence', a position in which one takes responsibility for oneself and the world, where one chooses one's freedom.\n\nChapters of \"The Second Sex\" were originally published in \"Les Temps modernes\", in June 1949. The second volume came a few months after the first in France. It was very quickly published in America due to the quick translation by Howard Parshley, as prompted by Blanche Knopf, wife of publisher Alfred A. Knopf. Because Parshley had only a basic familiarity with the French language, and a minimal understanding of philosophy (he was a professor of biology at Smith College), much of de Beauvoir's book was mistranslated or inappropriately cut, distorting her intended message. For years, Knopf prevented the introduction of a more accurate retranslation of de Beauvoir's work, declining all proposals despite the efforts of existentialist scholars. Only in 2009 was there a second translation, to mark the 60th anniversary of the original publication. Constance Borde and Sheila Malovany-Chevallier produced the first integral translation in 2010, reinstating a third of the original work.\n\nIn the chapter \"Woman: Myth and Reality\" of \"The Second Sex\", de Beauvoir argued that men had made women the \"Other\" in society by application of a false aura of \"mystery\" around them. She argued that men used this as an excuse not to understand women or their problems and not to help them, and that this stereotyping was always done in societies by the group higher in the hierarchy to the group lower in the hierarchy. She wrote that a similar kind of oppression by hierarchy also happened in other categories of identity, such as race, class and religion, but she claimed that it was nowhere more true than with gender in which men stereotyped women and used it as an excuse to organize society into a patriarchy.\n\nDespite her contributions to the feminist movement, especially the French women's liberation movement, and her beliefs in women's economic independence and equal education, de Beauvoir was initially reluctant to call herself a feminist. However, after observing the resurgence of the feminist movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s, de Beauvoir stated she no longer believed a socialist revolution to be enough to bring about women's liberation. She publicly declared herself a feminist in 1972 in an interview with \"Le Nouvel Observateur\".\n\nIn 2018 the manuscript pages of \"Le Deuxième Sexe\" were published. At the time her adopted daughter, Sylvie Le Bon-de Beauvoir, a philosophy professor, described her mother's writing process: Beauvoir wrote every page of her books longhand first and only after hired typists.\n\nPublished in 1954, \"The Mandarins\" is set after the end of World War II and won her France's highest literary prize, the \"Prix Goncourt\". The book follows the personal lives of philosophers and friends among Sartre's and de Beauvoir's intimate circle, including her relationship with American writer Nelson Algren, to whom the book was dedicated. Algren was outraged by the frank way de Beauvoir described their sexual experiences in both \"The Mandarins\" and her autobiographies. Algren vented his outrage when reviewing American translations of de Beauvoir's work. Much material bearing on this episode in de Beauvoir's life, including her love letters to Algren, entered the public domain only after her death.\n\nDe Beauvoir wrote popular travel diaries about time spent in the United States and China and published essays and fiction rigorously, especially throughout the 1950s and 1960s. She published several volumes of short stories, including \"The Woman Destroyed\", which, like some of her other later work, deals with aging.\n\n1980 saw the publication of \"When Things of the Spirit Come First\", a set of short stories centred around and based upon women important to her earlier years. Though written long before the novel \"She Came to Stay\", de Beauvoir did not at the time consider the stories worth publishing, allowing some forty years to pass before doing so.\n\nSartre and Merleau-Ponty had a longstanding feud, which led Merleau-Ponty to leave \"Les Temps Modernes\". De Beauvoir sided with Sartre and ceased to associate with Merleau-Ponty. In de Beauvoir's later years, she hosted the journal's editorial meetings in her flat and contributed more than Sartre, whom she often had to force to offer his opinions.\n\nDe Beauvoir also notably wrote a four-volume autobiography, consisting of: \"Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter\"; \"The Prime of Life\"; \"Force of Circumstance\" (sometimes published in two volumes in English translation: \"After the War\" and \"Hard Times\"); and \"All Said and Done\".\n\nIn the 1970s de Beauvoir became active in France's women's liberation movement. She wrote and signed the Manifesto of the 343 in 1971, a manifesto that included a list of famous women who claimed to have had an abortion, then illegal in France. Some argue most of the women had not had abortions, including Beauvoir. Signatories were diverse as Catherine Deneuve, Delphine Seyrig and de Beauvoir's sister Poupette. In 1974, abortion was legalised in France.\n\nHer 1970 long essay La Vieillesse (\"The Coming of Age\") is a rare instance of an intellectual meditation on the decline and solitude all humans experience if they do not die before about the age of 60.\n\nIn an interview with Betty Friedan, de Beauvoir said: \"No, we don’t believe that any woman should have this choice. No woman should be authorised to stay at home to bring up her children. Society should be totally different. Women should not have that choice, precisely because if there is such a choice, too many women will make that one. It is a way of forcing women in a certain direction.\"\n\nIn about 1976 de Beauvoir and Sylvie Le Bon made a trip to New York City in the United States to visit Kate Millett on her farm.\nIn 1981 she wrote \"La Cérémonie Des Adieux\" (\"A Farewell to Sartre\"), a painful account of Sartre's last years. In the opening of \"Adieux\", de Beauvoir notes that it is the only major published work of hers which Sartre did not read before its publication.\n\nShe contributed the piece \"Feminism – alive, well, and in constant danger\" to the 1984 anthology \"\", edited by Robin Morgan.\n\nAfter Sartre died in 1980, de Beauvoir published his letters to her with edits to spare the feelings of people in their circle who were still living. After de Beauvoir's death, Sartre's adopted daughter and literary heir Arlette Elkaïm would not let many of Sartre's letters be published in unedited form. Most of Sartre's letters available today have de Beauvoir's edits, which include a few omissions but mostly the use of pseudonyms. De Beauvoir's adopted daughter and literary heir Sylvie Le Bon, unlike Elkaïm, published de Beauvoir's unedited letters to both Sartre and Algren.\n\nDe Beauvoir died of pneumonia on 14 April 1986 in Paris, aged 78. She is buried next to Sartre at the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32610947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32610947", "title": "Society of Women Artists", "text": "Society of Women Artists\n\nThe Society of Women Artists (SWA) is a British art body dedicated to celebrating and promoting fine art created by women.\n\nIt was founded as the Society of Female Artists (SFA) in about 1855, offering women artists the opportunity to exhibit and sell their works. Annual exhibitions have been held in London since 1857, with some wartime interruptions.\n\nParticularly during the 19th century, the British art world was dominated by the Royal Academy (RA), founded in 1768. Two of the 34 named founders were women painters: Angelica Kauffman (1741–1807) and Mary Moser (1744–1819). However, it was not until 1922 that other female artists were admitted to the academy. Annie Swynnerton, a member of the Society of Women Artists since 1889, was elected as the first female associate member of the Royal Academy and in 1936, Dame Laura Knight became the first female elected full member of the Royal Academy. \n\nA woman's place in society was perceived as passive and governed by emotion. And in the 1850s, the idea that women could be artists was hotly debated by John Ruskin and other critics in various journals. Ruskin wrote to Sophia Sinnett in 1858 \"You must resolve to be quite a great paintress; the feminine termination does not exist, there never having been such a being as yet as a lady who could paint.” Women were not considered as serious contributors to the field of art and had great difficulty in obtaining a public showing. Their education in the arts was limited and they had been excluded from the practice of drawing from the nude figure since the Royal Academy was founded. However, Ruskin later revised his opinion of women artists after seeing Elizabeth Thompson's \"The Roll Call\" at the Royal Academy in 1874. After much debate and petitioning, in December 1883, the Royal Academy Schools agreed to provide life classes \"for the study of the partially draped figure\" to female students but it was a further 10 years before women were admitted to these classes. It was at this time that life classes for women were becoming more widely available across the country. \n\nNevertheless, British women artists proved themselves capable of working both individually and in collaboration and consequently, gained greater credibility. In order to progress and find opportunities to exhibit, they began to form their own organisations. One of the most significant of those bodies was the Society of Female Artists, founded around 1855. Initially, membership was granted to women who had exhibited with the Society and who earned their livelihood through art.\n\nIn 1855, English biographer Harriet Grote (1792–1878) and opera singer Jenny Lind (1820–1887) were cited as founder members of the SFA, with the society's first headquarters located at the Architectural Association in Conduit Street, London. The society was initially managed by a committee, and, although its members were sometimes listed in early catalogues, no presiding officer was ever named. Early members included Rosa Bonheur and Elizabeth Thompson.\n\nThe society's first exhibition, held at 315 Oxford Street, London between 1 June and 18 July 1857, became the focus of debate with regard to the role of women in art. The exhibition comprised 358 works by 149 female artists, the predominant genre being landscapes. In May 1857, prior to the opening, \"The Art Journal\" and \"The Spectator\" were supportive of the exhibition. The then secretary stated in \"The Art Journal\" (1 June 1857): \"The Committee are (sic) gratified to announce that the success of their first Exhibition has fully exceeded their expectations”. The Society then held annual exhibitions in London showing work of women artists (except in the years 1912–1914, 1919 and 1940–1946). \n\nUntil 1863, the annual exhibition received controversial reviews, probably as exhibits were chosen on a liberal and amicable basis. This was addressed in 1865, when their lack of professionalism led to a reorganisation of the Society under the patronage of the Duchess of Cambridge and consequently it was renamed the Society of Lady Artists. The Society has received royal patronage since 1865 (the current patron is HRH Princess Michael of Kent).\n\nIn 1867 Mrs. Madeline Marrable, a prolific watercolourist and oil painter, joined the committee.\n\nThe Society's earliest records were lost or destroyed during World War II at the Society's headquarters at 195 Piccadilly, London (the Society's catalogues and remaining papers dating from 1929 are now housed in the Victoria and Albert Museum Library). As a result, there is some debate as to exactly when the Society was renamed from the SFA to the SLA. Secondary sources of reference suggest 1869, whereas other sources suggest it was 1873.\n\nIn 1886, Marrable became the first president of the society. In 1899, the mid-Victorian persona was discarded and the 20th century was embraced by the society with a new name, the Society of Women Artists (SWA).\n\nThe society has had many notable artists among its members.

{"id": "4037557", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4037557", "title": "Swan Lake (Bourne)", "text": "Swan Lake (Bourne)\n\nMatthew Bourne's \"Swan Lake\" was first staged at Sadler's Wells theatre in London in 1995. The longest running ballet in London's West End and on Broadway, it has been performed in the UK, Los Angeles, Europe, Russia, Australia, South Korea, Japan, Israel and Singapore. The story is based on the Russian romantic ballet \"Swan Lake\", from which it takes the music by Tchaikovsky and the broad outline of the plot. Bourne's rendering is best known for having the traditionally female parts of the swans danced by men.\n\nThis synopsis is derived from programme notes and the synopsis provided on the DVD. The plot of the ballet revolves around a young crown prince, his distant mother, and his desire for freedom, represented by a swan.\n\nIn the prologue, the Prince, as a child, is awakened by a nightmare of a swan. The Prince's mother comes in to comfort him, but becoming nervous by the situation's intimacy, leaves.\n\nScene 1 opens with the Prince being prepared for a day of official duties by chambermaids and valets.\n\nIn Scene 2, arrayed in his full dress uniform, the Prince becomes bored by a boat christening, a ribbon cutting, and other official tasks. His mother prods him to keep up appearances, even as she devotes more attention to the soldiers than she does to him. During this scene, there is a transition from the child actor playing the young Prince to the identically-dressed adult dancer who portrays the grown Prince. This now-adult Prince is introduced to a girl called \"the Girlfriend\". Although the girl seems foisted on him by von Rothbart, the Private Secretary, the Prince prefers her to his duty-bound life.\n\nIn Scene 3, the Queen, one of her admiring soldiers, the Private Secretary, the Prince, and the Girlfriend all appear in a theatre box, where they watch a ballet that is staged for the actual audience as well as for the characters. The ballet's backdrop (from a design for Castle Falkenstein by Christian Jank), ornate costumes, and acting parody the romantic ballets of which the original \"Swan Lake\" was an example. The Girlfriend's responses to the dance, and her eventual dropping her purse from the royal box, annoy the Queen and von Rothbart.\n\nScene 4 finds the Prince drinking in his private chambers in front of a mirror, to his mother's shock. A nearly violent \"pas de deux\" ensues in which he pleads for her attention and love, while she rebukes him.\n\nThe Prince then goes into the streets and into the Swank Bar, a 1970s-style disco, in Scenes Five and Six. Here is where the choreography veers from classical ballet, with jazz forms and modern dance dominating. The Prince gets into a fight with sailors at the bar, and he is thrown out into the street. In Scene Seven, he sees the Girlfriend being paid off by von Rothbart, and he is totally shattered to discover that the only person who appeared to love him is a fake. This increases his desperation and he vows to kill himself.\n\nWhile sitting in the street at the end of Scene Seven the Prince imagines a group of swans flying towards him but the vision disappears. It is the first flash of the Prince's descent into mental turmoil.\n\nDistraught and disappointed that he will never find affection, the Prince writes a suicide note and goes to throw himself into a lake at a public park inhabited by swans. He is saved by a vision in which he encounters the lead Swan, who had appeared to him in his dreams. Initially rejected by the lead Swan, the Prince is gradually accepted and eventually taken into his arms, realizing what the Prince now knows he always desired. The Prince is elated and abandons his plan to kill himself. This Act contains the most talked-about element of the ballet in which bare-chested, male dancers play the swans, and it contains a very sensual \"pas de deux\" between the lead Swan and the Prince.\n\nScene 1 begins with princesses from various European nations and their escorts arriving at the palace gates for a grand ball. The Girlfriend sneaks in amongst them.\n\nScene 2 takes place in a proto-fascist ballroom where gigantic torchieres gripped by fists recall those of Jean Cocteau's \"La Belle et la Bête\". It commences with the arrival of the Queen and the Prince and some formal dancing, but quickly degenerates into a debauched party of drinking and lascivious come-ons. Into this arrives the charismatic and sexually aggressive son of von Rothbart, the Private Secretary, in black leather pants, who intensifies the sexual tension even further by flirting with every woman present, including the Queen. Each woman finds herself drawn to him and actively participates in the mutual, sometimes lewd, flirtation.\n\nJust as in the original \"Swan Lake,\" where customarily (although not always) one ballerina performs the roles of both the white swan (Odette) and the black swan (Odile), the same ballet dancer performs the white Swan and the black-clad young von Rothbart in this version. The Prince sees something of his beloved Swan in the son, and he is very attracted to his bravado and animal magnetism but shocked by his lewdness, especially towards his mother. During bump and grind group numbers and a sequence of national dances, it becomes clear that the Queen is powerfully attracted to von Rothbart's son. His father, the Private Secretary, looks on with an increasingly triumphant approval. The Prince also tries to approach young von Rothbart, only to be rebuffed. The Prince retreats into his mind and imagines dancing intimately with him, but the Prince's confusion interrupts the fantasy, and the son's movements turn from love to violence.\n\nThe Prince imagines the Queen and young von Rothbart flaunting their growing physical affection for each other. They join with the other guests at the ball to laugh and ridicule him because of his growing distress. The Queen and young von Rothbart end their dancing with an embrace and passionate kissing. The Prince, in his fury, violently separates them and is rewarded by outrage from both and a slap from his mother. Overwhelmed by conflicted feelings, the Prince produces a pistol and threatens to shoot his mother. In an ensuing scuffle the Girlfriend tries to dissuade the Prince, while the Private Secretary draws a pistol and points it at the Prince. As shots ring out, the Girlfriend and the Prince fall to the ground, but only the Girlfriend has been hit. She lies unconscious and the Prince is dragged away, while the Queen throws herself into young von Rothbart's arms. He gives the pistol he had taken from the Prince to his father, the two of them laughing.\n\nThe plot has evolved over the 15 years since the debut. The most conspicuous change Bourne made was to remove the subplot of the von Rothbart conspiracy to put his son on the throne. The Private Secretary now becomes just a functionary (no longer a von Rothbart counterpart, nor villain) and the Stranger is no longer shown conspiring with him. The identity of the Stranger becomes even more vague and Bourne prefers to leave him and his relationship with the Prince up to the individual interpretation of the viewer.\n\nIn the final act, the Prince, regarded as having lost his mind, is confined to an asylum in a room with a high barred window, and is treated by a doctor and a team of nurses wearing masks that resemble the Queen's face, in a scene reminiscent of his dressing at the beginning of the ballet. The Queen visits but, again, she is still unable to fully express love for her son.\n\nThe Prince crawls into bed and appears to sleep. However, he begins writhing as he dreams of the troupe of swans emerging from under and behind, dancing around him. He wakes from his nightmare, checking under his bed and around his room for swans. His tortured expression and jerky movements convey the Prince in turmoil. His lead Swan then slowly emerges from within the Prince's bed. The Swan dances with the Prince and assures him of his continued affection. But, the rest of the swans turn on the lead Swan when he makes it clear that he values his relationship with the Prince more than he does them. They separate the two and begin attacking the Prince before the Swan leaps in to save him. The Swan embraces the Prince and envelops him in his wings. The swans' fury increases and their next attack dismembers the Swan, who then disappears. Heartbroken and despondent, the Prince wails and collapses onto the bed. The Queen then finds her dead son's body and breaks down in sobs. However, in death the Prince and the Swan are reunited; as shown by a tableau depicting the lead Swan tenderly holding the young Prince in his arms.\n\nThe original \"Swan Lake\" was based on the story of Ondine, a German myth with a theme common in Romanticism that was adapted by Hans Christian Andersen for his story \"The Little Mermaid\". Ondine was a beautiful and immortal water nymph. The only threat to her eternal happiness was if she fell in love with a mortal and bore his child, as she would then lose her immortality. Ondine duly fell in love with a dashing knight, Sir Lawrence, and they were married, the knight pledging unfailing love and faithfulness to her with his every waking breath. A year after their wedding Ondine bore Lawrence a son. From that moment she began to age. As Ondine’s beauty faded, Lawrence lost interest in her.\n\nOne afternoon Ondine was walking near some stables when she heard the familiar snoring of her husband. When she entered the stable, she saw Sir Lawrence lying in the arms of another woman. Kicking her husband awake, she cursed him such that he would have breath so long as he remained awake, but if he ever fell asleep his breath would be taken from him and he would die.\n\nAccording to Alastair Macaulay (formerly chief dance critic of \"The Times Literary Supplement\" and chief theatre critic of the \"Financial Times\", now chief dance critic for \"The New York Times\"), the Ondine myth is said to be an image of psycho-sexual distress: the nymph is a forlorn image of repressed virginity, anxious that she will never achieve womanly fulfillment, while her feminine nemesis that leads her husband astray represents the confident seductive power that threatens her hopes. The story is double-edged: the human protagonist, in loving the nymph, transgresses against his own kind and may be punished. If, having betrayed her once, he returns to her, her kiss will bring him death; in fact, it may be this love-in-death that the man desires most.\n\nBourne's \"Swan Lake\" radically reinterprets the myth. The focus of the ballet is turned away from the Ondine character to the man – the Prince. It is the Prince who struggles against repression and hopes for liberty, and who needs love to make him safe. In addition, it is not the mortal who is unfaithful to the nymph. Rather, it is the Swan who (in Act Two) expresses love for the Prince, betrays him in the form of the Stranger (Act Three), and finally returns to him (Act Four). However, as in the Ondine myth, the sin of betrayal cannot be expiated except in death.\n\nMuch has been made of Bourne's decision to cast men as the swans. The original ballet is a standard in the European tradition of romanticized female–male love. The heroine, the swan princess Odette, is portrayed as powerless but lovely in accordance with conventional gender roles, and her hero is portrayed as a hunter who alone has the power to save her. Having a man in the role of lead Swan suggests that the Prince's struggle has repressed gay love at its core, and changes the realm of the plot from magical to psychological. The fierce, bird-like choreography given to the swan corps re-interprets the archetype of the swan as a pretty, feminine bird of gentle grace. According to Bourne, \"The idea of a male swan makes complete sense to me. The strength, the beauty, the enormous wingspan of these creatures suggests to the musculature of a male dancer more readily than a ballerina in her white tutu.\"\n\nHowever, the same central themes carry through both works. Both are about doomed, forbidden love, and both feature a Prince who wishes to transcend the boundaries of everyday convention through that love. Both themes have strong ties to the life of Tchaikovsky, the ballet's composer, whose homosexuality caused a number of complications in his life.\n\nIn order to accommodate his revised scenario, Bourne somewhat altered Tchaikovsky's score, reordering several numbers and omitting others. For example, No. 5 has been moved in its entirety from Act One to Act Three, where it follows the (reordered) national dances. Act Three has been trimmed by leaving out most of No. 19 and all of the following \"pas de deux\".\n\nThe show premiered at Sadler’s Wells on 9 November 1995:\n\nMatthew Bourne's \"Swan Lake\" has collected over 30 international awards, including the following:\n\nThe final scene of the film \"Billy Elliot\" (2000) shows the lead character, Billy, played by Adam Cooper, as an adult about to perform in this production as the lead Swan.\n\n\n\n"}

The film was written by Miroslav Lekić, Slobodan Stanojević and Igor Bojović. The plot is based on Vuk Drašković's novel of the same name.\n\nThe main motive of the film is the eventually disclosed nonsense of ethnic division in Bosnia, pointing out to the same historical origin of both opposed ethnic groups, Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Muslims - Orthodox Christians and Sunni Muslims, respectively. Set in the 1960s and observed from the point of view of Alija Osmanović, a young Muslim medical student raised by a single mother, his entire family slaughtered and his baby brother kidnaped by Serbs in Second World War, as the aftermath of Jugovići (Christian) and Osmanovići (Muslim) violent family feud, he learns not only that Osmanovići were once but a branch of Jugovići family who converted to Islam during the Turkish rule, but that, unbeknownst to his mother, he himself was a baby taken from Jugovići, after the massacre of Jugovići on Christmas Eve in 1942. Both families now extinct, and Alia as the descendant of both, torn between two cultures and two identities, he struggles to maintain his inner peace, desperately searching for his long lost step-brother and fighting the prejudices against the love relationship he has with a Serbian colleague student.\n\nBased on true events of World War II and being centered on the atrocious crimes committed to Serbs during World War II, and the particular families of Jugovići and Osmanovići.\n\nIn 1999, the film was screened at the 13th Montenegro Film Festival, and gained five featured awards.

Alongside Shirley Knight, leading players are James Caan and Robert Duvall, both of whom would later work with Coppola in \"The Godfather\". Future film director and Coppola friend George Lucas worked as an aide on this film, and made a short making-of documentary film, \"Filmmaker\", about it. The film also won the Golden Shell at the 1969 San Sebastian Film Festival.\n\nThe film received mixed initial reviews, but modern reception is more often positive.\n\nThe current DVD release from Warner Archive appears to be from a 16mm print.\n\nHousewife Natalie Ravenna (Shirley Knight) decides that she needs a break from marriage after discovering she is pregnant. She meanders across the United States trying to deal with the notion of being responsible. Along the way she meets a man oddly named Killer (James Caan) with a past he is not ready to reveal.

Things are further complicated when Natalie gets involved with a handsome but lonely highway patrolman Gordon (Robert Duvall).\n\n\nThe film served as a vehicle for Duvall and Caan, who at the time roomed with each other and were doing a few films together. Later, they and Coppola teamed for the film \"The Godfather\".\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film four stars out of four and compared Natalie Ravenna's quest to that of the Peter Fonda character in \"Easy Rider\", and called them both \"lineal descendants of the most typical American searcher of them all, Huckleberry Finn.\" He concluded: \"It's difficult to say whether his film is successful or not.

He married Priscilla Horton, a noted singer, actress and dancer, in 1844. By 1851, he was managing opera productions at various theatres in London and on tour. In 1855, Reed and his wife began to present and perform in \"Mr. and Mrs. German Reed's Entertainments\", consisting of brief, small-scale, family-friendly comic operas. In the early and mid-Victorian era, the respectable middle classes regarded the theatre in general as sinful. Therefore, the Reeds shrewdly called their establishment the \"Gallery of Illustration\" and their productions \"entertainments\" to emphasize their refined propriety.\n\nIn addition to comic classics like \"The Beggar's Opera\", the Reeds usually presented new works by English writers such as F. C. Burnand, W. S. Gilbert, William Brough and Gilbert à Beckett. His composers included Frederic Clay, Arthur Sullivan, George Macfarren and Alfred Cellier, as well as himself. Reed retired in 1871 after an injury, and his son Alfred took over the entertainments with his mother.\n\nReed was born in Bristol, the son of Thomas Reed (1795–1871), a musician, and his wife, Frances, \"née\" German (1796–1839). He studied music with his father and made his debut at the age of ten as a pianist and singer at the Bath Theatre. The family moved to London where Thomas Reed was appointed conductor at the Haymarket Theatre. The young Reed played, sang and acted at the theatre. In 1832, German Reed became an organist at the Roman Catholic Chapel in Sloane Street and assistant to his father, who moved to be conductor at the Garrick Theatre. His work at the theatre included scoring and adapting new operas, including \"Fra Diavolo\" in 1837. He also gave private music lessons.\nIn 1838, German Reed was appointed chapel-master at the Royal Bavarian Chapel and also became musical director at his father's former employer, the Haymarket Theatre, where he continued to work until 1851 with the exception of a temporary closure in 1843, during which he produced Pacini's opera \"Sappho\" at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. During these years, he met Priscilla Horton, a successful and popular contralto and actress who had been performing on the stage in London since the age of ten. They married in 1844. In 1851, Reed was engaged to assist in the production of opera at the Surrey Theatre and later managed Sadler's Wells Opera for a season and also conducted the music at the Olympic Theatre, as well as touring extensively in the British provinces.\n\nIn the spring of 1855, at St. Martin's Hall, German Reed and his wife presented the first performance of \"Miss P. Horton's Illustrative Gatherings,\" musical theatre. These performances usually consisted of one or two brief comic operas designed for a minimal number of characters and performed with either the piano and harmonium or a small ensemble of musicians. They eventually became \"Mr. and Mrs. German Reed's Entertainments\", presented at the Royal Gallery of Illustration in Regent Street, beginning in 1856, and later at St. George's Hall. At a time when the respectable middle classes regarded the theatre in general as sinful and even dangerous places of naughty humour, alcohol and prostitution, the Reeds called their establishment the \"Gallery\" of Illustration, rather than a \"theatre\", and their productions \"entertainments\" or \"illustrative gatherings\", rather than plays, extravaganzas, or burlesques. \"The Times\" characterised the works as \"extravaganza of the more refined order.\" Reed and his wife almost always appeared in these pieces, and on the few occasions when they did not, the box-office receipts suffered.\nReed became the lessee of St. George's Hall in 1867, and there he initially produced and conducted \"The Contrabandista\" by Arthur Sullivan and F. C. Burnand, \"The Beggar's Opera\" and other English operas in small-scale productions, as well as non-musical plays. Around the same time, at the Gallery of Illustration, he presented works with libretti by, among others, W. S. Gilbert, William Brough, Gilbert à Beckett, Robert Reece and Arthur Law. His composers included Frederic Clay, George Macfarren, Alfred Cellier and Hamilton Clarke as well as Sullivan and Reed himself. He wrote the scores for more than a dozen of the entertainments, and is described by the museum curator Fredric Woodbridge Wilson as \"an imaginative and effective writer of music for the stage\". Little of Reed's music survives. A few individual songs were published, but the scores of the entertainments were not. The autograph of the music for \"Our Island Home\" is preserved in The Morgan Library & Museum, New York, but no other scores are known to be extant.\n\nWhen the lease on the Gallery of Illustration ended in 1873, the German Reed entertainments moved to St. George's Hall. After falling from his horse when hunting, Reed had retired in 1871; his son Alfred (1847–1895) took over the entertainments with his mother, continuing with the entertainments after her retirement in 1879, until 1895.\n\nGerman Reed died at St. Croix, Upper East Sheen, Surrey at the age of 70. He was buried in Old Mortlake Burial Ground.\n\n\n\n"}

It is illustrated with a schematic map of the tongue, with certain parts of the tongue labeled for each taste. Although widely taught in schools, this was scientifically disproven by later research; all taste sensations come from all regions of the tongue, although different parts are more sensitive to certain tastes.\n\nThe theory behind this map originated from a paper written by Harvard psychologist D.P Hanig, which was a translation of a German paper, \"Zur Psychophysik des Geschmackssinnes\", which was written in 1901. The unclear representation of data in the former paper suggested that each part of the tongue tastes exactly one basic taste.\n\nThe paper showed minute differences in threshold detection levels across the tongue, but these differences were later taken out of context and the minute difference in threshold sensitivity was misconstrued in textbooks as a difference in sensation.\n\nWhile some parts of the tongue may be able to detect a taste before the others do, all parts are equally capable of conveying the qualia of all tastes. Threshold sensitivity may differ across the tongue, but intensity of sensation does not.\n\nThe same paper included a taste bud distribution diagram that showed a \"taste belt\".\n\nIn 1974, Virginia Collings investigated the topic again, and confirmed that all the tastes exist on all parts of the tongue.\n\nThe misinterpreted 2013 diagram in the article that sparked this myth shows human taste buds distributed in a \"taste belt\" along the inside of the tongue.\n\nPrior to this, A. Hoffmann had concluded, in 1875, that the dorsal center of the human tongue has practically no fungiform papillae and taste buds, and it was this finding that the diagram describes.\n"}

She is the daughter of Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) and Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). The character is born in the serial, conceived in a controversial storyline about teenage pregnancy. Exploiting a whodunnit angle, at the time of the first showing, viewers were not initially told who was the father, and press interest in the fledgling show escalated as journalists attempted to guess. The audience finally discovered his identity in October 1985 in episode 66. Written by series co-creator/script-editor Tony Holland and directed by co-creator/producer Julia Smith, it was considered a landmark episode in the show's history. Early suspects were Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and Kelvin Carpenter (Paul J. Medford), but then four possible suspects are seen leaving the Square early in the episode: Tony Carpenter (Oscar James), Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih), Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson), and Den Watts. As Michelle waits by their rendezvous point, a car pulls up and the fluffy white legs of the soap landlord's poodle Roly leap out of a car to give it all away: Den Watts is the father of Michelle's baby. After this storyline the programme started to appear in newspaper cartoons as it moved more and more into the public mainstream.\n\nVicki's character was written out in 1995, after Susan Tully, who played Vicki's mother Michelle, decided to leave the soap. After an eight-year absence, she was reintroduced by Executive Producer Louise Berridge in 2003 as a rebellious teenager. Her reintroduction was part of the soap's attempt to rebuild the Watts clan, a successful family headed by Den, that featured prominently in the 1980s. Johnson quit the role in 2004. The media was generally critical about the character upon her return due to her American accent and its sudden disappearance. During the character's original stint, a storyline featuring Vicki being kidnapped was criticised due to its coincidental airing alongside the real-life abduction and murder of toddler James Bulger.\n\n16-year-old Michelle Fowler gets pregnant in 1985 after a one-night stand with her best friend Sharon's (Letitia Dean) father, Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). Her family decide Michelle should have an abortion but she refuses, keeping the baby but keeping the father's name a secret. Vicki, named in honour of her great-grandparents Lou Beale (Anna Wing) and Lou's late husband Albert, is born in 1986 and Den is allowed to hold her but he and Michelle agree that he should keep his distance so nobody guesses he is her father. Michelle raises Vicki with her fiance, Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt), who she marries after jilting him at the altar, although Den provides for Vicki secretly. After Sue Osman (Sandy Ratcliff) realises that she has had a phantom pregnancy, she is devastated and suggests to Michelle that she lets her and Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih) adopt Vicki, which infuriates Michelle. Vicki's grandmother, Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard), realises Den is Vicki's father when she sees him give money to Michelle and slaps him. Lofty begins to pressure Michelle to let him adopt Vicki and have another child, but their marriage soon breaks down after Michelle has an abortion and Michelle refuses to name Vicki's father upon Lofty's departure. When Den is shot and presumed dead, Michelle tells Sharon that Vicki is her half-sister and Sharon is devastated whilst Arthur is furious. Vicki survives meningitis but Dr Legg (Leonard Fenton) fails to diagnose it, reuniting Michelle and Sharon.\n\nMichelle decides to go on the run with Clyde Tavernier (Steven Woodcock) after he is accused of murdering Eddie Royle (Michael Melia), taking Vicki and Kofi Tavernier (Marcel Smith), Clyde's son, with them. Michelle and Clyde are caught by the police when trying to flee the country and Vicki and Kofi are sent to a children's home, but are later collected by their grandmothers. Vicki is kidnapped when an old woman, Audrey Whittingham (Shirley Dixon), takes her from outside her school. A national police investigation is launched and Vicki is returned home safely. When Michelle is shot by Dougie Briggs (Max Gold), Vicki discover she is Sharon's half-sister when she stays with Sharon and her husband, Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) and the following day, Sharon explains things to Vicki. Michelle is furious with Sharon about Vicki knowing. The truth about Vicki's paternity spreads and Michelle's aunt, Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth), is upset about not being told by Michelle herself, finding out from Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton). In October 1995, Michelle and 9-year-old Vicki leave Walford for Birmingham, Alabama, in the United States.\n\nA teenage Vicki returns to Walford in February 2003 when she runs away from home. She has been arguing regularly with Michelle and it is decided that she can stay in Walford. After clashing with her grandmother Pauline, Vicki moves in with Sharon. Manipulative and mischievous, Vicki does as she pleases. Just weeks later, she discovers that she and Sharon have a half-brother, Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) - and persuades him to move to Walford. When she becomes pregnant by Spencer Moon (Christopher Parker), Sharon, who believes she is infertile, offers Vicki £10,000 to give her the baby to bring up as her own. Spencer wants to be a father but Vicki terminates the pregnancy.\n\nDennis soon tells Vicki that Den, who had supposedly died in 1989, is alive and living in Spain, and she brings him back to the Square to reunite with his family. She's horrified to discover that Sharon and Dennis have started a romantic relationship. Although they aren't biologically related, Vicki cannot accept it and rebels by dating Ash Ferreira (Raji James), which ends when he realizes that she is using him to get at her siblings. Eventually, Vicki and Den's objections take their toll on Sharon and Dennis and they end the relationship.\n\nIn 2004, an 18-year-old Vicki starts a relationship with her 46-year-old college lecturer, Tommy Grant (Robert Cavanah); her family, particularly stepmother Chrissie Watts (Tracy-Ann Oberman), are outraged. Tommy feigns love for Vicki and they talk about leaving Walford to go travelling. Knowing that Tommy is untrustworthy, Chrissie attempts to seduce him. After a brief kiss, Chrissie strips him naked in the toilets of The Queen Victoria public house, on the promise that she will soon join him. She steals his clothes and forces Vicki to see him for the lying cheat he is. Vicki is devastated and initially furious with Chrissie but eventually realizes she had her best interests at heart.\n\nDuring a family meal on Christmas Day 2004, Sharon and Dennis announce that they have resumed their romantic relationship, only for Dennis's girlfriend Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) to announce that she is pregnant. Sharon decides to go to America alone and persuades Dennis to stay with Zoe and their baby. Den talks to Sharon alone, trying to persuade her to stay. Vicki overhears him say he does not love Vicki as much as he loves Sharon. Deciding she cannot live with such a father, Vicki decides to return to her mother in America. It is later revealed that she has moved to Australia and reunited with Spencer. In January 2014, Sharon tells Spencer's brother, Alfie Moon (Shane Richie), that they need someone to help them open a bar in Sydney, so Alfie goes there for a few weeks to work with them.\n\nThe conception of Vicki Fowler in 1985 was one of the first controversial storylines featured in \"EastEnders\" since its inception that February, as it involved the pregnancy of a schoolgirl, Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully). Exploiting a whodunnit angle, viewers were not initially told who was the father, and press interest in the fledgling show escalated as journalists attempted to guess. The audience finally discovered his identity in October 1985 on episode 66. Written by series co-creator/script-editor Tony Holland and directed by co-creator/producer Julia Smith, it was considered a landmark episode in the show's history. Four possible suspects were seen leaving the Square early in the episode: Tony Carpenter (Oscar James), Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih), Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson), and Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). As Michelle waited by their rendezvous point, a car pulled up and the fluffy white legs of the soap landlord's poodle Roly leapt out of a car and gave it all away: Den Watts had fathered Michelle's baby. After this storyline the programme started to appear in newspaper cartoons as it moved more and more into the public mainstream.\n\nBaby Emma Henry originated the role and played Vicki until 1988, when her parents moved to Scotland. The role was recast to Samantha Leigh Martin, who learned to call Susan Tully \"Mummy Shell\" and referred to Letitia Dean who played her mum's best friend, \"Daddy Sharon\". Tully has commented, \"What's lovely about working with Samantha is that she's always happy. When it comes to work, she knows it's playing a pretend game, she knows my real name but she knows to call me 'Mummy Shell' when the cameras are running. If she isn't involved for a couple of weeks, I like to visit her at home, so she's always relaxed with me.\" Tully worried about this when it came to filming scenes in 1989 where Vicki contracted meningitis and was hospitalised and placed in an incubator with tubes attached to her body. Tully said, \"[Samantha] has seen me in all kinds of situations but I didn't know how she'd cope if I cried over her\". At Tully's suggestion, the BBC built a hospital room with minimal equipment and a consultant was present to make sure the BBC had the details correct and that neither the viewers or Samantha would be too distressed. Tully insisted that the child was not present when she had to film scenes of Michelle sobbing over the incubator.\n\nIn 1995, after 9 years onscreen being featured in various plot lines such as kidnapping, Vicki was written out of \"EastEnders\", moving to America with Michelle.\n\nIn 2002, Executive Producer Louise Berridge decided to reintroduce the character 8 years after she had last appeared. Auditions were held to cast the role to a professional actor; however, auditionees were not informed which character they were auditioning for. The first audition was a group workshop of 30 auditionees, who were asked to perform improvisations. After whittling down potential actors from 500 to 4, the second stage of the audition process was an interview with \"EastEnders\"' Casting Director. The auditionees were asked to perform a monologue in front of a camera and do a screen test with one of the actors already in the show, Christopher Parker, who played Spencer Moon. 17-year-old actress Scarlett Johnson was cast: \"At the second audition they gave me a monologue to read, but they'd been really careful about it. They hadn't said what the character's name was, they didn't give away anything in the monologue that might tell me who I was auditioning for. So I didn't know until I got the part who I was going to be playing--I'd been guessing for ages!\" Asked how she felt when she knew she was playing Vicki Fowler, a character linked to the show's early history who is the daughter of 2 prominent original characters, Johnson said: \"I felt very honoured, but it was quite scary. I knew there'd be a lot of people out there with expectations of what she'd be like. But it's good fun actually. It means you don't have to introduce yourself to everyone. You can really play with that [...] My family are \"EastEnders\" addicts, we've watched it our whole lives. I remember the first Vicki, I remember Michelle and I definitely remember Dirty Den! My knowledge of the show really helped a lot, because I didn't have to do any research into the character. When I joined the show, I felt like I was meeting the actors for a second time. I'd already met them in my home on TV, then I had to actually meet them in real life!\" The character made her reappearance in January 2003, turning up unexpectedly at her grandmother Pauline's (Wendy Richard) house.\n\nTo signify the character's 8 years living in America, Johnson was required to use an American accent while playing Vicki. She was given a voice coach and a sheet of American phrases to practice weekly. She commented, \"It is hard work, but it's becoming second nature now. As soon as I know that I'm Vicki, the accent just comes with it.\" After 6 months in the role, Vicki dropped the American accent. Johnson explained the reason for the change in 2004: \"The producers knew that I had to have an American accent when I came into the show because my character had been living in America but it's not the kind of accent that you'd want to have for a long time on a show like \"EastEnders\". It's not something that's going to fit in for a long period of time. What would have been perfect would have been to have it gradually fade out, but as you film 8 episodes at a time, this would be nigh on impossible. The decision was made that in the story Vicki was coming to terms with the fact that she wanted to live in London so therefore she was going to make a conscious effort to fit in with everyone around her and blend in with London life.\"\n\nThe reintroduction of Vicki was part of the producers' plan to reform the Watts family, including the resurrection of Vicki's father Den, who had been presumed dead for 14 years. Discussing working with Leslie Grantham, who played Vicki's \"iconic\" father Den, Johnson said, \"I was 2 when he left \"EastEnders\" [in 1989] so I never witnessed the hype surrounding him. I'm very aware of the legend. How could I not be? My only concern was that he should take me seriously [and] It's been fabulous. I can't wait for our scenes to be shown. They're really edgy and no one does edgy better than Leslie. It's been a massive challenge but I think the results are incredibly hard-hitting. \"EastEnders\" is becoming more like a serial drama than a soap. It's so well-written.\"\n\nVicki has been described as a \"little madam\" and a rebel. An \"EastEnders\" source commented, \"Vicki has inherited a lot of her dad Den's traits - she is going to be a right handful\". Johnson has said, \"Everyone loves to hate her, but I rather like that. I'd be more upset if she was nondescript. At least I provoke a passionate response in people. It's great being a bad girl.\"\n\nIn August 2004, the BBC announced that Johnson had decided to quit her role as Vicki. She commented, \"I've had a really good two years, enjoyed all the experiences but it's time to move on\". A spokesman for the soap said, \"It’s her decision to go. We’d like to thank her for all her fantastic work and wish her the very best of luck.\" Johnson filmed her final scenes in October and her departure coincided with that of Vicki's half-sister, Sharon (Letitia Dean). Vicki departed on the Christmas Day episode of 2004. 12.3 million viewers watched the episodes that involved the Watts family's disbandment. Media reports claimed that there were plans to bring Vicki back the following year, played by a new actress; this proved to be false. Her character was notably absent at the funerals of Vicki's father Den in September 2005, her brother Dennis in January 2006, and her grandmother Pauline in January 2007.\n\nFollowing her departure from \"EastEnders\", Johnson was more candid in her reasons for leaving: \"I've had a great time but it got to the point where I was sat in bed at night thinking: 'Tomorrow will my character be crying, getting drunk or having an argument?'. It soon became physically exhausting and draining [...] I don't think the producers were very happy when I said I wanted to leave. I was still very new and they had just set up the new Watts dynasty but no-one could have made me change my mind. When I said to the producers I wanted to go they told me they might have to recast Vicki. I don't mind. Life goes on and EastEnders goes on. I wouldn't want to go back at the moment - but never say never.\"\n\nAccording to author Hilary Kingsley, the scenes in \"EastEnders\"' early years that showed toddler Vicki \"chattering happily\" with the baby actor who played her uncle Martin (Jon Peyton Price) were viewer favourites. \"EastEnders\" was criticised in 1993 for featuring a storyline about child abduction at an inappropriate time. In the storyline, 6-year old Vicki was abducted, leaving Michelle frantic with worry. In what has been described as a \"coincidence of ill-timing,\" the storyline was screened at the same time as the real-life abduction and murder of 2-year-old James Bulger. The BBC was forced to transmit a health warning prior to the airing of the episodes, announcing that the storyline would be \"resolved positively.\"\n\nIn the book, \"Social Issues in Television\", a senior, nameless script editor opined that the abduction storyline sought to engage the audience at the expense of any parent's realistic concerns: \"We get it wrong when we take the easy route like the kidnap snatch with Vicki. My argument about this was that I am a father but have never had my kids snatched. If I'm just sitting at home and my children are out late at night and they say they're going to be back at midnight and they don't come back, you immediately think they're dead and you start to worry. If they'd actually been snatched, it would have affected my entire life forever. I would never have recovered from it. I would have been frightened every time one of them left my side. Therefore the consequence of running a storyline like that is immense. If we were being totally responsible about it the fallout on Michelle would have been, well I just don't think she would have been the same person again.\"\n\nThe character received media criticism due to her American accent upon her reintroduction in 2003. Johnson said, \"I knew that would happen because I'm the only character who speaks differently. I haven't taken any of that to heart.\" However, when the accent was altered from American to British, this received criticism too with Ian Hyland from the \"Daily Mirror\" describing it as \"hilarious\" and branding the character \"Go Away Again Vicki\". He added, \"Presumably the producers decided the reason viewers found her so annoying was her whiny American voice. Try again, guys.\" Upon her departure in 2004, Johnson was also critical about her character's alternating accent: \"When I took the job they weren't sure what accent they wanted Vicki to have and about a week before they told me it should be American. I did that for a few months and then one day out of the blue I arrived on set and they told me they wanted me to change to Cockney. It was the producer's decision. I was as stunned as everyone else - all the criticism was perfectly justified. It's probably the most stupid decision they could have made. People assumed I was slipping out of the accent - but it was nothing to do with me. I've taken a lot of stick. But it doesn't bother me because I know the truth.\"\n\nA proportion of viewers responded negatively when Vicki was shown to have an abortion. Johnson claims she received abusive letters from fans of the show and that she was stopped in the street twice by older women who told her \"it was quite wrong [...] to have got rid of the baby. I found that awkward at the time. But, gradually, I came to realise it was rather flattering. Those women believed in my character so completely they forgot she wasn't real. So now I think I must have been doing a good job.\" Johnson has since been critical of the storylines given to her character describing them as weak.\n\n"}
