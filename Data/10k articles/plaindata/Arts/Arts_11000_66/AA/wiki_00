She has completed more than thirty film and video works and installations, and six books. An acknowledged pioneer in montage, Child’s early film work addressed the interplay between sound and image through reshaping narrative tropes, prefiguring many concerns of contemporary film and media.\n\nIn 1968, Abigail Child graduated from Radcliffe College in Harvard University with a degree in history and literature. She has received a Guggenheim Fellowship in Film. She has taught at several universities, including New York University, Massachusetts College of Art, and Hampshire College. She has been the chair of Film and Animation department at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston since 2000 and was appointed to a fellowship at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. In 2009, she was awarded the Rome Prize.\n\nChild began making films in the 1970s, producing seven independent documentaries shot on 16mm. From the middle of the 70s she turned to experimental montage and in the 80s her work explores gender and strategies for remaking narrative. \"Is This What You Were Born For?\" is a major, seven-part experimental work from this period, completed over nine years, which included the cult classics \"Mayhem\" and \"Covert Action\". (see Filmography). In the 90s Child poetically envisioned and interrogated public spaces in such films as \"B/side\"(1996), about urban homelessness on the Lower East Side of New York city, and \"Below the New: A Russian Chronicle\" (1999), filmed in St. Petersburg.\n\nIn the 21st century, Child’s film and video has explored history, memory, and cultural experiences—the politics of place and identity. Digital works like \"Cake + Steak\" (2004) and \"The Future Is Behind You\" (2005) investigate the awkward drama of the everyday, often utilizing found material to examine the past. \"Mirror World\" (2006) is a multi-screen installation that incorporates parts of Child’s “foreign film” series to explore narrative excess. Key works include \"Surface Noise\" (2000), \"Dark Dark\" (2001), \"Where The Girls Are\" (2002), \"Cake and Steak\" (2004), \"The Future Is Behind You\" (2004), \"To and No Fro\" (2005), and \"Mirror World\" (2006). Her feature video documentary \"On The Downlow\" (2007)), is an exploration of bisexuality and an intimate look at a little-viewed underground scene.\n\nIn 2012, Child completed a feature film, \"Shape of Error,\" an imaginary “home movie” based on the diaries of Mary Shelley during her marriage with Percy Shelley.\n\nChild is also the author of five books of poetry (published between 1983 and 2012) and a book of critical writings: \"This Is Called Moving: A Critical Poetics of Film\" (2005).\n\nA collection of writings by various authors on \"Is This What You Were Born For?\", including a DVD of the film series, was published in 2011.\n\n\n\n"}

She was portrayed by Catherine Oxenberg for two seasons from 1984 to 1986, and then by Karen Cellini for 13 episodes from 1986 to 1987.\n\nAmanda was originated by Catherine Oxenberg in the 1984 fifth season episode \"Amanda\". Oxenberg left \"Dynasty\" in 1986, following a salary dispute before her third season on the show. Though her publicist insisted that the actress left \"Dynasty\" voluntarily, several media outlets reported that she was fired.\n\nThe role was immediately recast with Karen Cellini, who appeared for 13 episodes of the series' seventh season before the character was written out in the 1987 episode \"The Rig\".\n\nAmanda did not appear in the 1991 miniseries continuation, \"\".\n\nClose on the heels of Fallon Carrington Colby's disappearance and presumed death in a plane crash, a young woman named Amanda Bedford appears in the penthouse of Alexis Colby, Fallon's mother, in \"Amanda\". Raised primarily by Alexis' cousin Rosalind Bedford, she is Alexis' daughter, come to Denver from England to give her mother support after Alexis' recent arrest and acquittal for the murder of Mark Jennings.\n\nAs news of Alexis' \"new\" daughter spreads, ex-husband Blake takes a special interest, soon learning that Alexis had been pregnant when he had exiled her from Denver almost two decades earlier. Though Alexis insists that Amanda's father is a ski instructor with whom she was involved, it is eventually revealed that she is indeed Blake's daughter and that Alexis kept her hidden from him as revenge for being banished years before.\n\nAmanda is attracted to Alexis' fiancé Dex Dexter, and attempts to seduce him. When they find themselves snowed in together in a remote cabin, they give in to their feelings and make love. Immediately afterwards, Dex regrets his actions and announces that he and Alexis will marry.\n\nSullen and depressed, Amanda is invited by Blake to a conference in Acapulco, where she meets the handsome Prince Michael of Moldavia. Alexis, who had known Michael's father King Galen years ago, encourages the relationship. Amanda learns that Michael is engaged to Elena, a Moldavian duchess, but he assures Amanda that it had been a loveless match. Michael proposes and Amanda, despite her lingering feelings for Dex, accepts.\n\nDuring their engagement, Amanda is almost kidnapped by Moldavian rebels but rescued by Dex. In the 15 May 1985 season finale \"Royal Wedding,\" the rebels undertake a large-scale coup, interrupting the wedding in an attempt to kill Galen. Terrorists spray the chapel with gunfire, leaving the entire wedding party seemingly dead or dying on the floor.\n\nAmanda, Michael and the rest of the Carrington family survive the attack, though Luke Fuller—the gay lover of Amanda's brother Steven—and family friend Lady Ashley Mitchell are killed. Galen is missing and presumed dead, and rightful heir Michael is forced to leave the country.\n\nExile, however, puts a strain on Amanda and Michael's marriage, as he and Alexis become obsessed with rescuing Galen (who is being held for ransom) and restoring the monarchy. Amanda and Dex are drawn closer as Amanda catches Michael and Elena in a compromising position and Dex catches Alexis with a crown, imagining herself as Queen of Moldavia. Amanda finds a drunken Dex and they make love again—only to be caught in the act by Alexis. Alexis and Dex divorce, as do Amanda and Michael. After Alexis discovers that Galen has in fact been manipulating her, the Moldavian royal family leaves for Lisbon and is never heard from again.\n\nAmanda is devastated when Dex does not want to pursue a relationship with her. She romances Clay Fallmont, but their family rivalry drives him into the arms of Steven's ex-wife Sammy Jo. Amanda is involved in a drunk driving accident which is covered up by Blake; estranged from her mother and feeling isolated from her family, Amanda eventually attempts suicide. She survives, and reconciles with a forgiving Alexis. Amanda decides to pursue Clay again. In the 1986 season finale episode \"The Choice (a.k.a.) The Vendetta\", Sammy Jo catches Amanda and Clay kissing at the La Mirage hotel; the women fight, winding up in the swimming pool in their party dresses. Meanwhile, Amanda's sister-in-law Claudia Carrington accidentally sets the hotel on fire.\n\nIn the seventh season premiere episode \"The Victory,\" Amanda is trampled in the chaos surrounding the fire but rescued by a mysterious stranger. He turns out to be Michael Culhane, her father's former chauffeur who had been fired (and beaten up by Blake's thugs) in the first season for having an affair with Fallon. Now grateful to Michael, Blake offers him his job back, but is no happier than before when Michael and Amanda begin dating. Amanda is warned about Michael by sister Fallon, but refuses to leave him. Eventually, an upset and confused Amanda learns that Michael has become wealthy and is using her to get to Blake, and she is last seen in \"The Rig\" on January 7, 1987. In \"The Portrait,\" Blake offhandedly explains to Michael that Amanda has returned to England \"to think.\" The character never appears or is mentioned again during the series.\n\nOxenberg won two \"Soap Opera Digest\" Awards in 1985, for Outstanding Supporting Actress and Outstanding Female Newcomer.\n"}

Known for her innovative experimentation with both natural and synthetic materials, Thorpe was a featured instructor and lecturer throughout the United States. She has weavings in the permanent collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum. An annual award given in her honor is presented by the Institute of American Indian Arts for fiber arts.\n\nAzalea Stuart Gray was born on 10 April 1911 on her family's estate, \"Blinkbonnie\", in Peebles, Scotland to Marion R. \"May\" and Andrew Gray. She immigrated in 1916, with her mother to the United States, joining their father in Flint, Michigan, where he was employed as a machinist in an automobile plant. After the family arrival, another daughter, Marcia was born. The girls attended public schools in Flint and at the age of eighteen, Gray was working in the automobile industry. By the mid-1930s, she had married Alfred E. Thorpe, moved to Ohio and in 1937, the couple had their daughter, Sheila. After Thorpe divorced, she moved to Europe, where she traveled extensively and studied French for eighteen months. Returning to the United States, she enrolled in a textile design course at Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, studying with Marianne Strengell.\n\nUpon her graduation from Cranbrook, Thorpe began teaching weaving techniques and by 1953, was conducting a speaking tour with exhibits on weaving. After several years of teaching at Cranbrook, she moved to Deer Isle, Maine, where she taught at the Haystack Mountain School of Crafts before moving to New York City around 1953. In New York, Thorpe opened a design studio in Manhattan at 10th Avenue and 57th Street, where she experimented with a range of both natural and synthetic fibers. She continued with her own education at the Scottish Woollen Technical College in Galashiels, Scotland and taught at the Fashion Institute of Technology in the 1950s.\n\nThorpe was interested in textile manufacture for both industrial and home use. She designed fabrics for use in coats, drapery, rugs, and wall coverings as well as a special fabric for use with speakers which would not distort the transmission of sound. She participated as a technical advisor, along with Jack Lenor Larsen and Russel Wright, to the International Cooperation Administration. She was interested in varied dyeing techniques and conducted in-depth research on new types of materials, such as the natural protein fiber \"Vicara\" and corn fiber to determine its adaptability for both design and manufacture. Her research was conducted as a collaboration with the architect Kent Cooper. Displaying her work at craft fairs and exhibitions, in varied locations like Texas and Florida, she also juried events for the National Conference of American Craftsmen and the annual International Women's Exhibition, among others.\n\nIn addition to her design work, Thorpe, who was a jazz enthusiast, wrote as a columnist at \"Downbeat Magazine\". Meeting many of the noted musicians in the field, she worked as a personal manager for such artists as the De Paris Brothers, Sidney and Wilbur; Miles Davis; and Abbey Lincoln. She exhibited works at the Brussels World Fair in 1958 and toured Europe with the United States Information Service Exhibit. Her works were featured in major museum collections, such as a 1954 weaving in the permanent holdings of the Victoria and Albert Museum. In 1960, she was part of a New York State Education Department television series \"Adventures in Art\" where she discussed weaving.\n\nIn 1962, Thorpe moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico and began teaching weaving at the newly founded Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA). She served as the chair of the fiber and textile arts department of IAIA, but continued to work on research projects in New York, like a 1964 study of South and Central American textiles. On 11 November 1966, Thorpe married Lloyd Kiva New, a Cherokee fashion designer.\n\nThorpe left the IAIA in 1966, returning east to conduct seminars and study Southeastern weaving techniques. She published articles on the school and in 1967, co-authored the book \"Elements of Weaving\" with Jack Lenor Larsen and the following year returned as head of the fiber department at IAIA. In 1969, she designed the paraments for the Bethlehem Lutheran Church in Los Alamos, New Mexico. The initial hanging representing the Trinity was woven in browns, greens and rust hues. Additional hangings in red for Pentecost, violet for Advent and Lent, and a third in white for Christmas and Easter were also commissioned. That same year, she published a review of the exhibit \"Young Americans 1969\", stressing that weaving was able to be both art and craft.\n\nThorpe died on 29 December 1988 at her home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, after a lengthy illness with cancer. The Institute of American Indian Arts established the \"Azalea Thorpe New Memorial Award\" in her honor to recognize excellence in fiber arts.\n\n\n"}

It is noted for its pictorial decoration which is of the highest quality and for its perfect proportions and is considered among the most outstanding works of its type. For centuries the baptismal font stood in the western part of the nave, until it was moved to the last of the northern side-chapels (George's chapel) in 1653. During the ongoing renovations of the cathedral (2010–2014) it is being displayed in the Bode Museum in Berlin. After the completion of the renovation work, it will be placed in the centre of the nave under the Hezilo chandelier.\nThe font is made up of a round pot, which widens towards the top, a tapering lid with four allegorical figures and a bauble on top. It has a total height of 1.7 m and a diameter of 96 cm.\n\nThe lively decorative style foreshadows Gothic art, but also shows a Byzantine influence, especially in the architectural elements. The postures and faces of the figures are especially emotionally expressive.\n\nThe image program, divided into three horizontal bands and four vertical columns, is of great symbolic significance. The imagery can be interpreted on a number of levels and offers an ascetic and biblical understanding of the font overall. The imagers are further explained by Latin titles and inscriptions.\n\nThe lowest band shows four human figures, which support the whole font. These are personifications of the four rivers of the Garden of Eden (). Each of them pours out the water of life: at baptism what was dried up by sin, begins to flow once more. The four figures are clearly distinct in clothing, posture, and hairstyle and symbolise different classes and phases of life. In a small area above their heads, they are identified with the cardinal virtues: moderation, valor, justice, and wisdom. In this respect, the armour worn by the figure labelled as valour is particularly notable. The natural virtues were meant to be brought to fulfillment by the act of baptism.\n\nThe second level, on the body of the font, shows the most significant aspects of baptism with four scenes from the Old and New Testaments:\n\n\nThe next layer up is the four scenes on the lid. They present the significance of baptism for the Christian life.\n\n\nVertically, the baptism of Christ correlates with his anointment by the prostitute, the Mother of God with the staff of Aaron, the Exodus with the Massacre of the Innocents and the Ark of the Covenant with the personification of Mercy.\n\nNarrow columns rise up from the personifications of the rivers in between the scenes, which support triple arches above each scene. Their bases name the cardinal virtues and they show further biblical figures in the spaces between scenes above their capitals (sometimes the same figures are repeated), with the animals symbolising each of the evangelists above these spaces on the main body of the font: \nThese arrangements are also significant.\n\n\n"}

A blockage discount adjusts the fair market value of the works downward because of the risks of depreciation when a large volume of art is released into the market all at once.\n\nA blockage discount adjusting fair market value also affects the tax consequences of a sale in the U.S., and is frequently a subject of litigation when an artist dies while holding a large collection of her or his own work. For instance, when Georgia O'Keeffe died she had over 400 of her own works in her estate, and when Andy Warhol died he had over 90,000 works, including 4,100 paintings, 9,000 drawings, 19,000 prints and 63,000 photographs. In Georgia O'Keeffe's case, her estate's appraisers established blockage discounts based on solid evidence of market sales, but the IRS used its own valuation and the Tax Court assessed a resulting tax of more than the valuation of the collected works at her death. In Andy Warhol's case Surrogate Court of New York rejected the proposed discounts of Christe's, which averaged 60%. Instead, the court applied an average discount of 25%. The court failed to articulate the specific rationale for its determination, but did state that Warhol was more famous than Smith & O'Keeffe. The court's application of an average discount of 25% has been criticized by attorneys and appraisers because, inter alia, it ignored the necessary time it would take to sell 90,000 pieces of art. Therefore, accountants and estate planners for artists plan with such eventualities in mind.\n\nThe IRS has stated that carrying costs and opportunity costs are relevant factors for consideration in blockage discounts, along with time to market.\n\n\nWadler, The Heirs of George Grosz Battle His Dealer's Ghost; A Protracted Lawsuit Outlives Its Target, But Not Its Anger, The New York Times, August 27, 2001.\n"}

The chief compiler was Manus O'Duignan, one of a family who were ollavs and scribes to the McDonagh and the McDermots. Other scribes of the book were Solomon O'Droma, a member of a famous Co. Fermanagh family, and a Robert McSheedy. The book is a compilation of older works, mostly loose manuscripts and valuable documents handed down from antiquity that came into possession of McDonagh.\n\nThe first page of the work contains a drawing of Noah's Ark as conceived by the scribe. The first written page is missing and the second opens with a description of the ages of the world.\n\nThe work contains treatises on the history of the Jewish peoples; St. Patrick and his household; Cormac's instructions to a king; and a physical and geological survey of Ireland. Part of the work is devoted to the sagas of Finn and Brian Boru, and the Lebor na Cert (Book of Rights). It also contains treatises on metre and the profession of a poet, and on the Ogham writing and language. The book ends with several translations from the Greek: the destruction of Troy and the wanderings of Ulysses, followed by a resume of Virgil's 'Aeneid', beginning with Nestor's speech to the Greeks.\n\nThe Book of Ballymote, like many of its kind, has made history by its wanderings. For over a hundred years it was a treasured possession of the McDonaghs of Corran. About the beginning of the 16th century, it fell into the possession of the O'Donnells with whom it remained until the Flight of the Earls in 1603. From 1620 until 1767 it was in the library of Trinity College, Dublin. It disappeared from the library and was later found in Burgundy, France. In 1785 it was returned to the Royal Irish Academy where it remained as one of the Academy's most treasured possessions. The work was photographed by the Academy in 1887 and two hundred copies of it were made. One copy is in the diocesan archives and others in libraries.\n\nThe first page of the work contains a drawing of Noah's Ark.

She is also known in Scottish Gaelic as maighdean na tuinne (\"maid of the wave\") or maighdean mhara (\"maid of the sea\"). \n\nThe ceasg lives not only in the sea but also in rivers and streams, and can be made to grant three wishes to anyone who captures her. Marriages sometimes occur between ceasg and humans, and famous maritime pilots are often reputed to be descended from such unions. Even when these marriages end and the ceasg returns to the sea, they will always take an interest in their human descendants, protecting them in storms or guiding them to the best fishing grounds.\n\nThe ceasg is sometimes imagined as something more monstrous. In some tales she swallows the hero and he remains alive in her stomach. The hero's wife plays a harp until the mermaid is charmed and the hero escapes. When the wife stops playing the mermaid swallows her, and the hero must consult a wizard for help. He is told that he must obtain a special egg that contains the mermaid's life force. He obtains the egg, rescues his wife, and kills the mermaid by crushing the egg. In these stories the hero had been promised to the mermaid before his birth. His father had been childless and the mermaid promised him sons on condition that the firstborn would be given to her.

Thott 143 2º) is a 12th-century illuminated manuscript psalter, made in England. It has 199 leaves, is made of parchment and measures x . It begins with a calendar and a set of full-page miniatures illustrating the life of Christ, and 166 illuminated initials. The calligraphy and the illuminations are of the very highest quality.\n\nThe manuscript was made probably in northern England, perhaps Lincoln. Because the list of saints in the manuscript does not include Thomas Becket, who was canonized in 1173, it is likely that the manuscript was executed before this year. Several artists seem to have been involved in the making of the manuscript, one of whom has been identified as the so-called Simon master, who also worked for Abbot Simon of St Albans.\n\nMuch seems to indicate that the book was made for King Canute VI of Denmark, and commissioned by Bishop Eskil of Lund. The Bishop was in France between 1158 and 1168, and so was with all probability one of the artists identified as having worked with the Copenhagen Psalter later. When Eskil returned to Denmark in 1168, he was commissioned with preparing celebrations in 1170 which were to take place due to both the upcoming coronation of Canute and to celebrate the canonization of Saint Canute. Perhaps because it was made for a boy king, just seven years old, the Copenhagen Psalter includes an alphabet, and aside from its religious use, could be used to teach the young king to read. Earlier scholars have assumed that the manuscript was made for an English patron.\n\nAn alternative theory has been proposed in 2016 by Christopher de Hamel, who proposes as patron King Valdemar the Great, ruler of Denmark, 1157-82. De Hamel also remarks that although the illumination is in the English manner, it could have been executed (perhaps by an English team) either in Paris or even in Denmark. The evidence is inconclusive.\n\n"}

He is known for work based on a vision he experienced, which has been interpreted as the Resurrection of the Dead. His work is found in museums and private collections in Europe, the United States, and Australia.\n\nDonald Pass was educated on Stoke-on-Trent Regional College of Art (1947–1950) and the Royal Academy Schools in London (1951–1954).\n\nAt a young age, Donald Pass saw an angel with a lion's head at a roadside hedge. Later, while working in London as a painter, he saw through the window \"a beautiful face which appeared to be all gold. It seemed to expand through the window and embrace the whole room.\" \n\nPrior to 1969, Donald Pass worked as a landscape artist. In a churchyard in Cuckfield, Sussex in August of that year, he experienced a vision which has been described as:\n\" It was eleven in the morning on a bright day but suddenly everything darkened, and a strange light appeared with a sound like the rushing of wind. Vast fields stretched before him in which he could see miles into the distance as if it were close by, and the sky was an infinite black space with great lights moving in it. He was standing with a host of figures and gradually, he became aware of angels standing with them and coming towards them the sky. The angels were descending and ascending, coming from all directions and in all sizes. Some had their faces obscured, some had very compassionate and beautiful faces, others had faces of lions like the angel he saw in the hedge when he was a child.\n\nIn the middle, an enormous angel descended with outstretched arms and a face which Donald Pass says he can not describe. His descent was accompanied by a tremendous chorus of sound. Higher and at a distance was a beautiful and strange face in profile that had long hair yet was neither male nor female. It seemed unaware of the figures below. All the light stemmed from that extraordinary head and from the angels. It was a strange light and unlike sunlight, it spread in such a way that all the figures were illuminated.\n\nOn the ground, figures lay still with forms rising out of them as if something was emerging from a chrysalis. Donald Pass remembers that it looked \"almost like a transfiguration, a rebirth\" of the soul from the body. There were figures standing, and others going in three directions: one towards very dark angels who stood near the horizon and others upward in great columns into the sky where angels gathered them in. The dark angels stood very still a long way away, but those closer seemed to gather figures towards them. There were gangs of angels standing together, figures grouping together, and figures which Donald Pass say he can't describe standing together.

Thus, his paintings are raised from more description to the heights of distinctive painting formulae.\n\nDušan Jevtović participated in representative exhibitions in the country and abroad, such as \"Salons and Biennials of Naïve art in Jagodina\", Munich (1968), Rome and Tokyo (1971), Paris, Belgrade (2003), Sofia (2007), Budapest (2008), and in significant international exhibitions: Lugano (1969), Naivi (1979, 1973, 1977).\nHe was awarded numerous recognition for his work, among which the most important are the \"Award for Entire Artistic Work\" (1987) and \"Grand Prix at the Ninth and Twelfth Biennial\" (1999, 2005) of Museum of Naïve and Marginal Art, Jagodina.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2324104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2324104", "title": "Formalism (literature)", "text": "Formalism (literature)\n\nFormalism is a school of literary criticism and literary theory having mainly to do with structural purposes of a particular text. It is the study of a text without taking into account any outside influence. Formalism rejects or sometimes simply \"brackets\" (\"i.e.\", ignores for the purpose of analysis) notions of culture or societal influence, authorship, and content, and instead focuses on modes, genres, discourse, and forms.\n\nIn literary theory, formalism refers to critical approaches that analyze, interpret, or evaluate the inherent features of a text. These features include not only grammar and syntax but also literary devices such as meter and tropes. The formalistic approach reduces the importance of a text’s historical, biographical, and cultural context.\n\nFormalism rose to prominence in the early twentieth century as a reaction against Romanticist theories of literature, which centered on the artist and individual creative genius, and instead placed the text itself back into the spotlight to show how the text was indebted to forms and other works that had preceded it. Two schools of formalist literary criticism developed, Russian formalism, and soon after Anglo-American New Criticism. Formalism was the dominant mode of academic literary study in the US at least from the end of the Second World War through the 1970s, especially as embodied in René Wellek and Austin Warren's \"Theory of Literature\" (1948, 1955, 1962).\n\nBeginning in the late 1970s, formalism was substantially displaced by various approaches (often with political aims or assumptions) that were suspicious of the idea that a literary work could be separated from its origins or uses. The term has often had a pejorative cast and has been used by opponents to indicate either aridity or ideological deviance. Some recent trends in academic literary criticism suggest that formalism may be making a comeback.\n\nWilliam H Thelin criticizes Maxine Hairston’s approach to teaching composition from a current-traditional standpoint, which she then mixes with the political. He claims that “No matter how sound the politics … the student would have no choice but to regurgitate that dogma in the clearest terms possible and to shift concentration onto matters of structure and correctness”.\n\nMary Ann Cain writes that “formalism asserts that the text stands on its own as a complete entity, apart from the writer who produced it”. Moreover, Cain says that “one can regard textual products as teachable and still maintain that being a writer is a \"natural\" act, one not subject to instruction. Composition, like creative writing, has flourished under the assumption that students are already writers, or have the capacity to learn-and that everyone should be writers. Yet the questions composition tends to pose within this assumption are not so much about which aspects of writing can or cannot be taught, but how writing can be taught and under what conditions.\nIn regards to formalist composition, one must ask, “to what extent is this ‘need’ for ‘academic discourse’ real – any more than the need for more ‘imaginative writing’ is real-except to perform some function, to get something done?”.\n\nFormalism research involves studying the ways in which students present their writing. Some ways formalism research is conducted involves allowing the text to speak to the readers versus cutting out unintended meaning in a written piece. Respectively, these two methods deal with language as the “master” writer versus a teacher as the “master” writer.\n\nRussian Formalism refers to the work of the Society for the Study of Poetic Language (OPOYAZ) founded in 1916 in St. Petersburg (then Petrograd) by Boris Eichenbaum, Viktor Shklovsky and Yury Tynyanov, and secondarily to the Moscow Linguistic Circle founded in 1914 by Roman Jakobson. (The folklorist Vladimir Propp is also often associated with the movement.) Eichenbaum's 1926 essay \"The Theory of the 'Formal Method'\" (translated in Lemon and Reis) provides an economical overview of the approach the Formalists advocated, which included the following basic ideas:\n\nAccording to Eichenbaum, Shklovsky was the lead critic of the group, and Shklovsky contributed two of their most well-known concepts: defamiliarization (\"ostraneniye,\" more literally, 'estrangement') and the plot/story distinction (\"syuzhet/fabula\"). \"Defamiliarization\" is one of the crucial ways in which literary language distinguishes itself from ordinary, communicative language, and is a feature of how art in general works, namely by presenting the world in a strange and new way that allows us to see things differently. Innovation in literary history is, according to Shklovsky, partly a matter of finding new techniques of defamiliarization. The plot/story distinction separates out the sequence of events the work relates (the story) from the sequence in which those events are presented in the work (the plot). Both of these concepts are attempts to describe the significance of the form of a literary work in order to define its \"literariness.\" For the Russian Formalists as a whole, form is what makes something art to begin with, so in order to understand a work of art as a work of art (rather than as an ornamented communicative act) one must focus on its form.\n\nThis emphasis on form, seemingly at the expense of thematic content, was not well-received after the Russian Revolution of 1917. One of the most sophisticated critiques of the Formalist project was Leon Trotsky's \"Literature and Revolution\" (1924). Trotsky does not wholly dismiss the Formalist approach, but insists that \"the methods of formal analysis are necessary, but insufficient\" because they neglect the social world with which the human beings who write and read literature are bound up: \"The form of art is, to a certain and very large degree, independent, but the artist who creates this form, and the spectator who is enjoying it, are not empty machines, one for creating form and the other for appreciating it. They are living people, with a crystallized psychology representing a certain unity, even if not entirely harmonious. This psychology is the result of social conditions\" (180, 171). The Formalists were thus accused of being politically reactionary because of such unpatriotic remarks as Shklovsky's (quoted by Trotsky) that \"Art was always free of life, and its color never reflected the color of the flag which waved over the fortress of the City\"(source?)(164). The leaders of the movement suffered political persecution beginning in the 1920s, when Joseph Stalin came to power, which largely put an end to their inquiries. But their ideas continued to influence subsequent thinkers, partly due to Tzvetan Todorov's translations of their works in the 1960s and 1970s, including Todorov himself, Barthes, Genette and Jauss.\n\nThe Moscow Linguistic Circle founded by Jakobson was more directly concerned with recent developments in linguistics than Eichenbaum's group. Jakobson left Moscow for Prague in 1920 and in 1926 co-founded the Prague Linguistic Circle, which embodied similar interests, especially in the work of Ferdinand de Saussure.\n\n\n"}

The coin was designed by Chester Beach. Its obverse depicts the \"Half Moon\", flagship of Henry Hudson, after whom the city of Hudson is named. In addition to showing the ship, the coin displays a version of the Hudson city seal, with Neptune riding a whale, a design that has drawn commentary over the years.\n\nAlthough the city of Hudson was a relatively small municipality, legislation to issue a coin in honor of its 150th anniversary went through Congress without opposition and was signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, becoming the Act of May 2, 1935. In June 1935, 10,000 Hudson half dollars were distributed to civic authorities for sale to the public.\n\nMost of the coins were likely bought by coin dealers, leaving few for collectors, with the result that prices spiked from the $1 cost at the time of issue. This caused anger among coin collectors, but did not lower the coin's value, which has continued to increase in the 80-plus years since it was struck.\n\nHudson, New York, the seat of Columbia County, lies on the east bank of the Hudson River, south of Albany. It was founded in 1662 under the name Claverack Landing. Originally a trading post for the Rensselaer family, it saw considerable expansion in the early 1780s, and was incorporated under the name Hudson in 1785. During the 1930s, it had about 14,000 residents.\n\nIn 1935, commemorative coins were not sold by the government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, usually designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase them at face value and vend them to the public at a premium. In the case of the Hudson half dollar, the responsible official or group was to be designated by the Mayor of Hudson.\n\nA bill for a half dollar to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the incorporation of Hudson was introduced in the House of Representatives by New York Congressman Philip A. Goodwin on April 6, 1935, and provided for 6,000 pieces. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. Goodwin was the longtime president of the Greene County Historical Society, and introduced the bill as a favor for friends in nearby Hudson. A report was issued by Missouri's John J. Cochran, acting chairman of the committee, on April 2, 1935, recommending that the bill pass with an amendment increasing the mintage to 10,000, and noting that Goodwin had appeared before the committee to pledge that the entire quantity struck would be taken up by the city authorities, and thus there would be no coins left on the Mint's hands. On April 3, immediately after the House passed a bill for the Old Spanish Trail half dollar, it passed the bill for the Hudson piece on Cochran's motion, without debate or opposition. The Missouri congressman also included his report in the \"Congressional Record\".\n\nThe bill thus passed to the Senate, where it was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency. On April 11, 1935, New York Senator Robert F. Wagner issued a report, recommending that the bill pass unamended. When the bill was considered in the Senate on April 15, Rhode Island's Jesse H. Metcalf moved to amend it so that the bill would also provide for the issuance of a Rhode Island Tercentenary half dollar. There was no objection or debate concerning either the amendment or the bill as a whole, and it passed the Senate.\n\nBecause the two chambers of Congress had passed different versions of the bill, it returned to the House of Representatives. There, on April 18, on motion of Cochran, the House agreed to the Senate amendments, and it was enacted on May 2 by the signature of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen, in their 1988 volume on commemoratives, suggested that the bill passed because of \"probably the usual 'you vote for my bill and I'll vote for yours' arrangement\".\n\nOn the day Roosevelt signed the legislation, Congressman Goodwin wrote to Charles Moore, chairman of the Commission of Fine Arts, requesting the names of suitable artists to design the coin. The commission was charged by a 1921 executive order by President Warren G. Harding with rendering advisory opinions regarding public artworks, including coins. Moore suggested Laura Gardin Fraser as standing in the first rank of medallists, with other possibilities to include Mint Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock, Paul Manship, Francis H. Packer and Chester Beach. Mayor Frank Wise of Hudson asked if John Flanagan, who had recently designed the Washington quarter, would do; Moore agreed by telegram. However, the commission went to Beach for $1,000; the sculptor also agreed to guide the city through the coin approval process.\n\nWise and his officials had tentatively decided to have a head of Henry Hudson on one side of the coin, with the city seal on the other. Beach quickly prepared sketches and met with Wise on May 13, but convinced the mayor that instead of the explorer (no actual portrait of him is known) his ship, the \"Half Moon\", would be a better choice. Working at speed unusual for a commemorative coin of that era, Beach completed plaster models in one week, adding a crescent moon to the left of the ship. The models were converted to coinage dies by the Medallic Art Company of New York, who could accomplish the task faster than the Philadelphia Mint. Though records are not complete, the company apparently contacted the Mint for advice; Chief Engraver Sinnock sent it a letter on May 23. While unfamiliar with the Hudson legislation, Sinnock had confidence in Beach's ability because his previous designs were easy for the Mint to strike into coins. Beach quoted this praise in reporting to Moore on May 27 that Lee Lawrie, the sculptor-member of the Commission of Fine Arts, had approved the designs. Approval by the full commission followed on May 28, and by Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau a week later.\n\nThe obverse of the coin shows the \"Half Moon\", Henry Hudson's flagship, sailing to the right. To the left of the merchantman's rigging is a stylized crescent moon. The ship is surrounded with two rings of lettering, the inner reading \"\" and , and the outer the name of the country and the coin's denomination. The designer's monogram, , may be found at the waterline on the left side of the coin. The reverse is a rendition of the city of Hudson's seal, with Neptune holding a trident, riding backward on a whale. A mermaid or triton in the background blows into a conch shell. The seal design reflects Hudson's heritage as a whaling port, although it is some distance up the Hudson River from the ocean. The motto (\"Both the honor and the reward of the righteous\") is copied from the city seal; the name of the city and the anniversary dates surround the seal, with above the dates.\n\nDon Taxay, in his book on commemorative coins, described the seal as \"a rather whimsical composition\"; Beach had deemed it \"rather amusing\" and had hoped the new coins \"will be a little more interesting than the others I have done\". Swiatek and Breen referenced \"the quaint device of King Neptune riding backwards on a spouting whale, whose eye is represented as being about where its blowhole should be. Neptune is briefly clad in a wisp of cloth 'blowing in the wind'.\" They suggested that the position of the moon meant, if it was waxing, that the ship was sailing west toward America, but if waning, was sailing east to Europe.\n\nArt historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his volume about U.S. coins and medals, considered the ship on the obverse \"straightforward fare for commemorative half-dollars\", though he found the name \"\" beneath the waves unneeded given the legend on the reverse. The reverse based on the city seal was to him \"a harming throwback to colonial days, and in American numismatics to the quasi–federal and state issues of the period 1780 to 1792\". Vermeule noted \"the baroque motto above Neptune and his group [that] makes it evident that this subject, appealing and amusing in itself, appears here because it is the singular characteristic of the City of Hudson on the river of the same name\".\n\nOn June 12, 1935, John Evans, vice president of the First National Bank of Hudson, wrote to Mary M. O'Reilly, the acting Director of the Mint, asking on behalf of Mayor Wise that only 6,000 coins be struck at that time, with the remainder to be coined later if demand justified it. But the Mint delivered the entire authorization of 10,000 on June 28. Reservations for coins had been taken since early May (at $1 per coin, plus postage of $.03 per two coins and registered mail fee of $.18 per order), and on July 2, Evans, who was in charge of distribution, began informing what Swiatek called \"[i]nfuriated collectors\" that the coins were sold out. Coin dealer Julius Gruttag, of New York City's Gruttag Brothers, is believed to have bought 7,500 coins at $.95 each, with Hubert W. Carcaba, of Saint Augustine, Florida, believed to have bought 1,000. In addition to the 10,000 pieces distributed, eight coins were struck at Philadelphia and retained there to be available for inspection and testing at the 1936 meeting of the annual Assay Commission.\n\nThe uproar in the coin-collecting community resulted in bad publicity for the city of Hudson. Although the specifics of how the coins came to be so quickly sold out were not immediately known, collectors intuited a trick, especially when coins proved plentiful on the market at between $5 and $7 each. Many of these sold, helping set off a commemorative coin boom that would continue later in 1935 when low-mintage varieties of the Daniel Boone Bicentennial half dollar came on the market after a similar immediate sellout. But collectors wrote angry letters to numismatic societies and periodicals, and the Hudson piece was among those that future American Numismatic Association president L. W. Hoffecker complained about to Congress when he testified in March 1936. By 1940, the price on the secondary market had dropped back to $5.50, but thereafter rose steadily and reached $1,700 during the commemorative coin boom of 1980. The 2017 edition of R. S. Yeoman's \"A Guide Book of United States Coins\" lists the coin for between $700 and $1,500, depending on condition. A near-pristine specimen sold at auction in 2014 for $15,275.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "523499", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=523499", "title": "Iconography", "text": "Iconography\n\nIconography, as a branch of art history, studies the identification, description, and the interpretation of the content of images: the subjects depicted, the particular compositions and details used to do so, and other elements that are distinct from artistic style. The word \"iconography\" comes from the Greek (\"image\") and (\"to write\").\n\nA secondary meaning (based on a non-standard translation of the Greek and Russian equivalent terms) is the production of religious images, called \"icons\", in the Byzantine and Orthodox Christian tradition (see Icon).\n\nIn art history, \"an iconography\" may also mean a particular depiction of a subject in terms of the content of the image, such as the number of figures used, their placing and gestures. The term is also used in many academic fields other than art history, for example semiotics and media studies, and in general usage, for the content of images, the typical depiction in images of a subject, and related senses. Sometimes distinctions have been made between \"iconology\" and \"iconography\", although the definitions, and so the distinction made, varies. \nWhen referring to movies, genres are immediately recognizable through their iconography, motifs that become associated with a specific genre through repetition.\n\nEarly Western writers who took special note of the content of images include Giorgio Vasari, whose \"Ragionamenti\", interpreting the paintings in the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, reassuringly demonstrates that such works were difficult to understand even for well-informed contemporaries. Gian Pietro Bellori, a 17th-century biographer of artists of his own time, describes and analyses, not always correctly, many works. Lessing's study (1796) of the classical figure Amor with an inverted torch was an early attempt to use a study of a type of image to explain the culture it originated in, rather than the other way round. \n\nIconography as an academic art historical discipline developed in the nineteenth-century in the works of scholars such as Adolphe Napoleon Didron (1806–1867), Anton Heinrich Springer (1825–1891), and Émile Mâle (1862–1954) all specialists in Christian religious art, which was the main focus of study in this period, in which French scholars were especially prominent. They looked back to earlier attempts to classify and organise subjects encyclopedically like Cesare Ripa's \"Iconologia overo Descrittione Dell’imagini Universali cavate dall’Antichità et da altri luoghi \" and Anne Claude Philippe de Caylus's \"Recueil d'antiquités égyptiennes, étrusques, grècques, romaines et gauloises\" as guides to understanding works of art, both religious and profane, in a more scientific manner than the popular aesthetic approach of the time. These early contributions paved the way for encyclopedias, manuals, and other publications useful in identifying the content of art. Mâle's \"l'Art religieux du XIIIe siècle en France\" (originally 1899, with revised editions) translated into English as \"The Gothic Image, Religious Art in France of the Thirteenth Century\" has remained continuously in print.\n\nIn the early-twentieth century Germany, Aby Warburg (1866–1929) and his followers Fritz Saxl (1890–1948) and Erwin Panofsky (1892–1968) elaborated the practice of identification and classification of motifs in images to using iconography as a means to understanding meaning. Panofsky codified an influential approach to iconography in his 1939 \"Studies in Iconology\", where he defined it as \"the branch of the history of art which concerns itself with the subject matter or meaning of works of art, as opposed to form,\" although the distinction he and other scholars drew between particular definitions of \"iconography\" (put simply, the identification of visual content) and \"iconology\" (the analysis of the meaning of that content), has not been generally accepted, though it is still used by some writers.\n\nIn the United States, to which Panofsky immigrated in 1931, students such as Frederick Hartt, and Meyer Schapiro continued under his influence in the discipline. In an influential article of 1942, \"Introduction to an \"Iconography of Mediaeval Architecture\"\", Richard Krautheimer, a specialist on early medieval churches and another German émigré, extended iconographical analysis to architectural forms.\n\nThe period from 1940 can be seen as one where iconography was especially prominent in art history. Whereas most icongraphical scholarship remains highly dense and specialized, some analyses began to attract a much wider audience, for example Panofsky's theory (now generally out of favour with specialists) that the writing on the rear wall in the \"Arnolfini Portrait\" by Jan van Eyck turned the painting into the record of a marriage contract. Holbein's \"The Ambassadors\" has been the subject of books for a general market with new theories as to its iconography, and the best-sellers of Dan Brown include theories, disowned by most art historians, on the iconography of works by Leonardo da Vinci.\n\nTechnological advances allowed the building-up of huge collections of photographs, with an iconographic arrangement or index, which include those of the Warburg Institute and the \"Index of Christian Art\" at Princeton (which has made a specialism of iconography since its early days in America). These are now being digitised and made available online, usually on a restricted basis.\nWith the arrival of computing, the Iconclass system, a highly complex way of classifying the content of images, with 28,000 classification types, and 14,000 keywords, was developed in the Netherlands as a standard classification for recording collections, with the idea of assembling huge databases that will allow the retrieval of images featuring particular details, subjects or other common factors. For example, the Iconclass code \"71H7131\" is for the subject of \"Bathsheba (alone) with David's letter\", whereas \"71\" is the whole \"Old Testament\" and \"71H\" the \"story of David\". A number of collections of different types have been classified using Iconclass, notably many types of old master print, the collections of the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin and the German Marburger Index. These are available, usually on-line or on DVD. The system can also be used outside pure art history, for example on sites like Flickr.\n\nReligious images are used to some extent by all major religions, including both Indian and Abrahamic faiths, and often contain highly complex iconography, which reflects centuries of accumulated tradition.\n\nCentral to the iconography and hagiography of Indian religions are mudra or gestures with specific meanings. Other features include the aureola and halo, also found in Christian and Islamic art, and divine qualities and attributes represented by asana and ritual tools such as the dharmachakra, vajra, dadar, chhatra, sauwastika, phurba and danda. The symbolic use of colour to denote the Classical Elements or Mahabhuta and letters and bija syllables from sacred alphabetic scripts are other features. Under the influence of tantra art developed esoteric meanings, accessible only to initiates; this is an especially strong feature of Tibetan art. The art of Indian Religions esp. Hindus in its numerous sectoral divisions is governed by sacred texts called the Aagama which describes the ratio and proportion of the icon, called \"taalmaana\" as well as mood of the central figure in a context. For example, Narasimha an incarnation of Vishnu though considered a wrathful deity but in few contexts is depicted in pacified mood.\n\nAlthough iconic depictions of, or concentrating on, a single figure are the dominant type of Buddhist image, large stone relief or fresco narrative cycles of the \"Life of the Buddha\", or tales of his previous lives, are found at major sites like Sarnath, Ajanta, and Borobudor, especially in earlier periods. Conversely, in Hindu art, narrative scenes have become rather more common in recent centuries, especially in miniature paintings of the lives of Krishna and Rama.\n\nAfter an early period when aniconism was strong, surviving Early Christian art began, about two centuries after Christ, with small images in the Catacombs of Rome that show orans figures, portraits of Christ and some saints, and a limited number of \"abbreviated representations\" of biblical episodes emphasizing deliverance. From the Constantinian period monumental art borrowed motifs from Roman Imperial imagery, classical Greek and Roman religion and popular art – the motif of Christ in Majesty owes something to both Imperial portraits and depictions of Zeus. In the Late Antique period iconography began to be standardised, and to relate more closely to Biblical texts, although many gaps in the canonical Gospel narratives were plugged with matter from the apocryphal gospels. Eventually the Church would succeed in weeding most of these out, but some remain, like the ox and ass in the Nativity of Christ.\n\nAfter the period of Byzantine iconoclasm iconographical innovation was regarded as unhealthy, if not heretical, in the Eastern Church, though it still continued at a glacial pace. More than in the West, traditional depictions were often considered to have authentic or miraculous origins, and the job of the artist was to copy them with as little deviation as possible. The Eastern church also never accepted the use of monumental high relief or free-standing sculpture, which it found too reminiscent of paganism. Most modern Eastern Orthodox icons are very close to their predecessors of a thousand years ago, though development, and some shifts in meaning, have occurred – for example the old man wearing a fleece in conversation with Saint Joseph usually seen in Orthodox Nativities seems to have begun as one of the shepherds, or the prophet Isaiah, but is now usually understood as the \"Tempter\" (Satan).\n\nIn both East and West, numerous iconic types of Christ, Mary and saints and other subjects were developed; the number of named types of icons of Mary, with or without the infant Christ, was especially large in the East, whereas Christ Pantocrator was much the commonest image of Christ. Especially important depictions of Mary include the Hodegetria and Panagia types. Traditional models evolved for narrative paintings, including large cycles covering the events of the Life of Christ, the Life of the Virgin, parts of the Old Testament, and, increasingly, the lives of popular saints. Especially in the West, a system of attributes developed for identifying individual figures of saints by a standard appearance and symbolic objects held by them; in the East they were more likely to identified by text labels.\n\nFrom the Romanesque period sculpture on churches became increasingly important in Western art, and probably partly because of the lack of Byzantine models, became the location of much iconographic innovation, along with the illuminated manuscript, which had already taken a decisively different direction from Byzantine equivalents, under the influence of Insular art and other factors. Developments in theology and devotional practice produced innovations like the subject of the Coronation of the Virgin and the Assumption, both associated with the Franciscans, as were many other developments. Most painters remained content to copy and slightly modify the works of others, and it is clear that the clergy, by whom or for whose churches most art was commissioned, often specified what they wanted shown in great detail.\n\nThe theory of typology, by which the meaning of most events of the Old Testament was understood as a \"type\" or pre-figuring of an event in the life of, or aspect of, Christ or Mary was often reflected in art, and in the later Middle Ages came to dominate the choice of Old Testament scenes in Western Christian art.\nWhereas in the Romanesque and Gothic periods the great majority of religious art was intended to convey often complex religious messages as clearly as possible, with the arrival of Early Netherlandish painting iconography became highly sophisticated, and in many cases appears to be deliberately enigmatic, even for a well-educated contemporary. The subtle layers of meaning uncovered by modern iconographical research in works of Robert Campin such as the Mérode Altarpiece, and of Jan van Eyck such as the Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and the Washington Annunciation lie in small details of what are on first viewing very conventional representations. When Italian painting developed a taste for enigma, considerably later, it most often showed in secular compositions influenced by Renaissance Neo-Platonism.\n\nFrom the 15th century religious painting gradually freed itself from the habit of following earlier compositional models, and by the 16th century ambitious artists were expected to find novel compositions for each subject, and direct borrowings from earlier artists are more often of the poses of individual figures than of whole compositions. The Reformation soon restricted most Protestant religious painting to Biblical scenes conceived along the lines of history painting, and after some decades the Catholic Council of Trent reined in somewhat the freedom of Catholic artists.\n\nSecular painting became far more common from the Renaissance, and developed its own traditions and conventions of iconography, in history painting, which includes mythologies, portraits, genre scenes, and even landscapes, not to mention modern media and genres like photography, cinema, political cartoons, comic books and anime.\n\nRenaissance mythological painting was in theory reviving the iconography of the ancient world, but in practice themes like Leda and the Swan developed on largely original lines, and for different purposes. Personal iconographies, where works appear to have significant meanings individual to, and perhaps only accessible by, the artist, go back at least as far as Hieronymous Bosch, but have become increasingly significant with artists like Goya, William Blake, Gauguin, Picasso, Frida Kahlo and Joseph Beuys.\n\nIconography, often of aspects of popular culture, is a concern of other academic disciplines including Semiotics, Anthropology, Sociology, Media Studies and Cultural Studies. These analyses in turn have affected conventional art history, especially concepts such as signs in semiotics. Discussing imagery as iconography in this way implies a critical \"reading\" of imagery that often attempts to explore social and cultural values. Iconography is also used within film studies to describe the visual language of cinema, particularly within the field of genre criticism. In the age of Internet, the new global history of the visual production of Humanity (Histiconologia ) includes History of Art and history of all kind of images or medias.\n\nA non-exhaustive list:\n\n\n\n"}

It follows the plights of three different women and their experiences with abortion. Each of the three stories takes place in the same house, 22 years apart: 1952, 1974, and 1996. All three segments were co-written by Nancy Savoca. Savoca directed the first and second segment while Cher directed the third. The women's experiences in each vignette are designed to demonstrate the popular views of society on the issue in each of the given decades.\n\nDebuting at the Toronto International Film Festival, \"If These Walls Could Talk\" became a surprise success and was the highest-rated movie in HBO history. It was nominated for four Primetime Emmy Awards and three Golden Globe Awards, including Best Miniseries or Television Film.\n\nThe 1952 segment deals with Claire Donnelly (Demi Moore), a widowed nurse living in suburban Chicago, who becomes pregnant by her brother-in-law (Jason London) and decides to undergo abortion in order not to hurt her late husband's family. However, abortion at the time is strictly illegal. Claire eventually finds another nurse (C. C. H. Pounder) who provides her the phone number of a woman who can find her someone to perform the abortion. The woman on the phone tells Claire that the only trustworthy abortionist she knows is located in Puerto Rico, and Claire cannot afford the travel costs--with air fare and hotel costs, the total trip would cost about $1000, which is about $9500 in 2018. After a failed attempt to end her pregnancy with a knitting needle, Claire eventually contacts a man who comes to her home and performs a clandestine procedure on her while she lies on top of a kitchen table. Claire finally manages to abort, but dies shortly afterwards due to hemorrhage.\n\nThe 1974 segment deals with Barbara Barrows (Sissy Spacek), a struggling and aging mother with four children and a policeman husband who works the night shift, who discovers she must welcome another addition to the family, despite having recently gone back to college. She considers abortion with the support of her teenage daughter (Hedy Burress) but ultimately chooses to keep the child.\n\nThe 1996 segment deals with Christine Cullen (Anne Heche), a college student who got pregnant by a married professor, decides on an abortion when he breaks up with her and only offers her money. After consulting with her roommate (Jada Pinkett), she makes an appointment with Dr. Beth Thompson (Cher). However, the abortion takes place during a violent protest, and an anti-abortion protester (Matthew Lillard) walks in on the operation and shoots Dr. Thompson.\n\n1952 segment:\n\n1974 segment:\n\n1996 segment:\n\nAs executive producer, Moore spent seven years trying to get the film made, until the project was eventually greenlit by HBO. HBO vice president Colin Callender said \"I don't believe there's a studio in the world that would finance this picture\" and praised Moore and Cher for having the courage to use their celebrity to address the issue of abortion. Cher commented \"It took someone with Demi's power and fortitude to have something like this made. Without that power, you couldn't do it. These topics are not on everybody's top 10 list of things to do.\"\n\nA sequel anthology, \"If These Walls Could Talk 2,\" aired in 2000. The subject addressed in it was lesbianism.\n\n\n"}

Its main features were floppy hats, sunglasses and \"dust-catcher\" skirts. Bobo (\"i.e.\" \"bourgeois\"-Bohemian) chic was used in a similar sense.\n\n\"Beach chic\" was the title of an article in 2006 by the \"Times\" fashion editor Lisa Armstrong about shopping for accessories to accompany a bikini. These included a \"cover-up\" (\"e.g.\" a kaftan), flat sandals, a hat, a fake tan and - with the comforting footnote, \"No, you will not look like a WAG [wife or girlfriend of a footballer]\" - denture cleaner to whiten finger-nails. The \"Sunday Times\" referred to the Moroccan resort of Essaouira as the \"boho/barefoot-chic beach\" (the latter possibly a play on the term, \"bare-faced cheek\").\n\"See also Seaside chic\".\n\nTrend of fashion in the early 2000s (decade) which drew on earlier Bohemian and hippie styles. It was associated in particular with actress Sienna Miller and model Kate Moss. Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen have both become icons for this style.\n\nEmulating the style, of which Burberry was a feature, of Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, who married Charles, Prince of Wales in 2005.\n\n\"Casual chic\" (or \"chic casual\") is a difficult term to define, but can perhaps best be described as \"dressing down\" in a stylish way. In 2007, the clothing retailer Marks & Spencer suggested that some of the elements of \"chic casual\" were skinny jeans, \"longline, clingy jerseys\", \"statement\" bags and chunky jewellery, slouchy sweaters and hoodies with comfortable flats. Singer Victoria Beckham was identified as epitomising this style. Easy chic (\"breezy blouses, slouchy knits and sexy denim\") has similar connotations.\n\nReferring to fashion ranges promoted by major supermarkets: \"Tesco has stepped up its 'checkout chic' war with Asda by launching a design-led range of clothes to tempt female shoppers\". Cheap chic was used in a similar sense, though more in terms of the comparison between prices at supermarkets and those of leading fashion houses: \"You can achieve this season's look just by visiting your local supermarket\".\n\nUsed by the \"Sunday Times\" (\"The Sloane gets a sexy revamp\") for fashionable trends among well-heeled \"Sloane Rangers\" (a \"portmanteau\" term coined in 1975 by Peter York, style editor of \"Harpers & Queen\", from Sloane Square and the 1950s TV series \"The Lone Ranger\") in the Chelsea area of south west London.\n\n\"Council house chic\" or chav chic (\"Chav Chic might have sunk the house of Burberry\") referred to the fashions of working class \"chavs\" who shared Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall's taste for Burberry check. \"See also Camilla chic\".\n\nTo be well dressed and smart in everyday clothes whilst cycling for ordinary journeys.\n\nEco Chic means the use of eco-friendly textiles, such as organic cotton, silk and hemp, and also reconstructed clothing.\n\n\"The look of a computer nerd\".\n\nTitle of a \"connoisseur's guide\" by Gavin Baddeley (2002) to dark or Gothic culture. Among those associated with the \"goth look\" were the late 1970s punk band Siouxsie and the Banshees, American punk cabaret duo The Dresden Dolls, formed in 2000, and Betty Curse, described by \"The Times\" in 2006 as the \"princess of Goth pop\".\n\nHeroin chic was a look popularized in mid-1990s fashion and characterized by pale skin, dark circles underneath the eyes and angular bone structure. The look, characterised by emaciated features and androgyny, was a reaction against the healthy and vibrant look of models such as Cindy Crawford and Claudia Schiffer. A 1996 article in \"The Los Angeles Times\" opened that the fashion industry had \"a nihilistic vision of beauty\" that was reflective of drug addiction, while \"U.S. News & World Report\" called the movement a \"cynical trend\".\n\nHick chic\" was the subject of an article in \"Country Life\" in 2006 by Carla Carlisle, American-born wife of former British Member of Parliament, Sir Kenneth Carlisle. Lady Carlisle cited a friend's description of the term: \"it's farmers' markets, four-wheel drive cars, labradors, Harris Tweed, Shaker furniture, Emma Bridgewater [tableware] ...\". \"Hick\" derives from \"Old Hickory\", a nickname for Andrew Jackson, US President 1829-37, a frontiersman who, like hickory wood, was known for his toughness.\n\nApplied to the sort of \"everyday\" sense of style that might be spotted in any metropolitan or provincial setting; most likely to be associated with prevailing \"shop window\" fashions. In 2004 the \"Observer\" wrote of the singer Dido that \"she drifts on stage dressed in high-street chic: faded denim and a tracksuit top, which she slips off to reveal a pink camisole vest\". Samantha Cameron, wife of British Conservative Party leader and future Prime Minister David Cameron was described in 2006 as \"spurn[ing] the designers ... for high street chic\".\n\nBroadly similar to boho-chic (see \"e.g.\" London \"Evening Standard Magazine\", 11 March 2005), the Hippie chic was associated in the mid-1990s with Tom Ford’s collections for the Italian house of Gucci and, indeed, various aspects of hippie fashion re-appeared periodically after the \"Summer of Love\" of 1967 when hippiedom and psychedelia were at their peak. Art-school chic had roughly similar connotations. Talitha Getty chic was applied by Hedley Freeman in the \"Guardian\" to the hippie style associated in the late 1960s (and since) with the actress wife (died 1971) of John Paul Getty. Talitha Getty is said to have inspired Ford's hippie-style creations.\n\nRefers to the clothing style seen in some eastern and northern parts of Germany. It is composed of sweatpants or tracksuits, \"Basecaps\" and running shoes, commonly in bright colors like neon pink or yellow.\nThe name originates from the locality Berlin-Marzahn where this style can frequently be seen. It also refers to the clothing style of \"Cindy aus Marzahn\", a fictional character played by German comedian Ilka Bessin.\n\nAdoption of military gear such as camouflage patterned clothing, war medals, military insignia, surplus clothing or dog tag necklaces (adopted in the American Civil War) into fashion. The term and the similar soldier chic were widely applied \"c.\"2003-5, although in fact military apparel, such as the flight jackets worn by pilots during the Second World War, had frequently influenced fashion and paradoxically was often in vogue at times of anti-war feeling, such as in the late 1960s when protests against the Vietnam War were at their height (as, indeed, after the Iraq War of 2003): \"One would have thought, given the unpopularity of armed forces activity in some quarters, that 'military chic' would not be, well, chic\".\n\nNazi chic is the incorporation of Nazi style clothing and culture, often used for shock value, as a form of rebellion against the status quo, although it is sometimes accompanied by a genuine sympathy for or adherence to the ideology of National Socialism.\n\nOccasionally applied retrospectively to aspects of the musical and cultural boom generated by the rock group, the Beatles, and other artists such as Gerry & The Pacemakers and Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas in 1962-4 (the \"Mersey Sound\"). \"Northern\" is a reference both to Northern England (as also with \"Northern soul\") and Northern Songs, which published compositions by the Beatles' John Lennon and Paul McCartney.\n\nFrequently applied to anything stylish connected with the French capital Paris or to the style of French celebrities (\"e.g.\" actress Charlotte Gainsbourg or others living in Paris, such as the English actress Kristin Scott Thomas). Variants included \"Left Bank\" or \"Right Bank\" chic (or even \"Left Bank chic versus Right Bank polish\"). Gainsbourg's mother, the British-born actress Jane Birkin, remarked that she would choose \"English eccentricity over Parisian chic every time\", adding, \"chic you can learn - it's just a form of grooming\".\n\nThe term bon chic bon genre or BCBG [\"good style, good class\"] was applied in the early 1980s to the French equivalent of British \"Sloane Rangers\", their typical \"uniform\" including a mackintosh, ballet shoes, trousers, a cashmere sweater, and accessories such as a \"Birkin bag\" and a Cartier Tank Française wrist-watch. To a large extent, it refers to upper-class, or upper-middle-class, young men and women who are well-bred, or appear so, with good bones, slim bodies, and a sophisticated, but restrained and elegant, sense of style. In the U.S., the Ralph Lauren sense of style would be the equivalent.\n\n\"Porn chic\" was first applied to films such as \"Deep Throat\" (1972) and \"Emmanuelle\" (1974) which were commercially successful and thus tended to bring \"soft\" pornography into the mainstream. Subsequently it has been used to refer more generally to pornography in popular culture.\n\nFlat caps and floral dresses or aprons over jeans.\n\nFirst coined by journalist Tom Wolfe in 1970, radical chic has since entered broad usage as a derogatory term for the pretentious adoption of radical causes by celebrities, socialites, and high society.\n\nSaid to be \"oozed\" by a New York socialite in Plum Sykes' \"The Debutante Divorcée\" (2006).\n\n\"Rock-girl chic\" has meant different things during differing periods of music and fashion, but was often associated with a hippie image and was similar enough as a phrase to the slightly patronising \"rock chick\" to convey a sense of being a \"groupie\". This and similar terms, such as \"boho-rock\" (2006), were often applied to model Kate Moss, about whom Rebecca Ley from Times Online wrote that \"Kate veers effortlessly between rock-girl chic and dripping-in-diamonds elegance\". Moss's relationship in 2005–7 with Pete Doherty of the group Babyshambles tended to emphasise the tag.\n\nApplied by the \"Sunday Times\" to a fashion collection designed and modelled by Savannah Miller, Cotswold-based sister of actress and 2000s (decade) \"boho-queen\" Sienna Miller, for the Hong Kong based label, Shanghai Tang.\n\nThe deliberate use of worn and shabby materials in interior design or fashion. The effect of limewashing timber-framed buildings has been described as \"shabby chic\".\n\nTropical and Beach themed home accents that are influenced by island styles and tropical designs. Tropical Chic style includes modern appointments, yet casual island style living.\n\nCharacterized by crochet-knit tops, over-sized sweaters that hang loosely off a thin frame, flats, and circle-frame glasses that accentuate a doe-eyed appearance. Waif chic first came to prominence in Cambridge, MA and is a popular look among college students and young professionals in the area.\n\nFashion trend inspired by clothing typical of hikers, climbers, and mountaineers.\n"}

His style was largely Impressionistic, although it also derived to some extent from the Hague School. Many of his works were based on photographs he bought during his travels, some of which were by famous photographers such as Félix Bonfils.\n\nHe was born in The Hague. His father was a stage painter who encouraged his son's early interest in drawing. From 1878 to 1885, he studied at the Royal Academy of Art, under the direction of Jan Philip Koelman, but thought his approach was too conservative and left without graduating. While there, his works were awarded several medals and he received a stipend from King William III, which enabled him to study independently.\n\nIn 1888, he made a study trip to Istanbul, financed by the art dealership, Van Wisselingh & Co., and decided to make Orientalism his principal subject. Later, he made numerous trips to Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, India, Ceylon and the Dutch East Indies, sketching and collecting items for Van Wisselingh. He also worked as an illustrator for the short-lived literary journal, \"\", attending the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II on its behalf.\n\nIn 1894, he won a first-class medal at the Exposition Internationale d'Anvers. Two years later, he was awarded the Willink van Collenprijs. He received the Grand Prix at the Exposition Universelle (1900). In 1902 he married the painter Jo Stumpff, one of the Amsterdamse Joffers. This was followed by a successful showing at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. He would continue to exhibit regularly throughout Europe and North America.\n\nIn 1900, he was named a Ridder in the Order of Orange-Nassau. Six years later, he was upgraded to an Officer for his contributions to the Rembrandt Tri-centennial. In 1911, King Albert I of Belgium awarded him the Order of the Crown and, in 1927, he became a Ridder in the Order of the Netherlands Lion. He was a long-standing member of the Pulchri Studio and Arti et Amicitiae. In 1930, he became an honorary member of the Senefelder Club. Two years later, he died of a stroke. A street is named after him in the neighborhood of streets dedicated to 19th- and 20th-century Dutch painters in Overtoomse Veld, Amsterdam.\n\nIn 1996, the \"Bauer Documentatie Stichting\" (BDS) was established. Its goal is to raise awareness of his works and do more research on the sources of his paintings.\n\n\n\n"}

Fred Muhlenberg died on January 19, 1980, at 92 years of age.\n\nFollowing Mr. Muhlenberg's retirement in 1977, the Firm became the sole proprietorship of Lawrence A. Greene, Jr, (who had, at that time, been a partner of the firm for 25 years) until January 1, 1980 when the present corporation, Muhlenberg Greene Architects, Ltd., was established. The original principals/stockholders were Lawrence (Larry) A. Greene, Howard Quaintance, and James (Jim) E. Dockey. In 1983, Dennis W. Rex was added as a principal/stockholder of the Firm. In 1998, John R. Hill became a principal/stockholder. The current principals are Larry Greene, Howard Quaintance, Dennis W. Rex, and John R. Hill. Muhlenberg Greene Architects, Ltd. is a member of the American Institute of Architects and the U.S. Green Building Council, and many of the staff are LEED Accredited Professionals.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3627676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3627676", "title": "Nihonga", "text": "Nihonga\n\nNihonga (, \"Japanese-style paintings\") are Japanese paintings from about 1900 onwards that have been made in accordance with traditional Japanese artistic conventions, techniques and materials. While based on traditions over a thousand years old, the term was coined in the Meiji period of Imperial Japan, to distinguish such works from Western-style paintings, or \"Yōga\" ().\n\nThe impetus for reinvigorating traditional painting by developing a more modern Japanese style came largely from many artist/educators, which included; Shiokawa Bunrin, Kōno Bairei, Tomioka Tessai, and art critics Okakura Tenshin and Ernest Fenollosa who attempted to combat Meiji Japan's infatuation with Western culture by emphasizing to the Japanese the importance and beauty of native Japanese traditional arts. These two men played important roles in developing the curricula at major art schools, and actively encouraged and patronized artists.\n\n\"Nihonga\" was not simply a continuation of older painting traditions. In comparison with \"Yamato-e\" the range of subjects was broadened. Moreover, stylistic and technical elements from several traditional schools, such as the \"Kanō-ha,\" \"Rinpa\" and \"Maruyama Ōkyo\" were blended together. The distinctions that had existed among schools in the Edo period were minimized.\n\nHowever, in many cases \"Nihonga\" artists also adopted realistic Western painting techniques, such as perspective and shading. Because of this tendency to synthesize, although \"Nihonga\" form a distinct category within the Japanese annual Nitten exhibitions, in recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to draw a distinct separation in either techniques or materials between \"Nihonga\" and \"Yōga\".\n\nThe artist Tenmyouya Hisashi has (b. 1966) developed a new art concept in 2001 called \"Neo-Nihonga\".\n\n\"Nihonga\" has a following around the world; notable \"Nihonga\" artists who are not based in Japan are Hiroshi Senju, , American artists Makoto Fujimura and Judith Kruger, and Miyuki Tanobe. and Indian artist Madhu Jain. Taiwanese artist Yiching Chen teaches workshops in Paris.\nJudith Kruger initiated and taught the course \"Nihonga: Then and Now\" at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and at the Savannah, Georgia Department of Cultural Affairs.\n\nContemporary Nihonga has been the mainstay of New York's Dillon Gallery. Key artists from the \"golden age of post war Nihonga\" from 1985 to 1993 based at Tokyo University of the Arts have produced global artists whose training in Nihonga has served as a foundation. Takashi Murakami, Hiroshi Senju, Norihiko Saito, Chen Wenguang, Keizaburo Okamura and Makoto Fujimura are the leading artists exhibiting globally, all coming out of the distinguished Doctorate level curriculum at Tokyo University of the Arts. Most of these artists are represented by Dillon Gallery.\n\n\"Nihonga\" are typically executed on \"washi\" (Japanese paper) or \"eginu\" (silk), using brushes. The paintings can be either monochrome or polychrome. If monochrome, typically \"sumi\" (Chinese ink) made from soot mixed with a glue from fishbone or animal hide is used. If polychrome, the pigments are derived from natural ingredients: minerals, shells, corals, and even semi-precious stones like malachite, azurite and cinnabar. The raw materials are powdered into 16 gradations from fine to sandy grain textures. A hide glue solution, called \"nikawa\", is used as a binder for these powdered pigments. In both cases, water is used; hence \"nihonga\" is actually a water-based medium. \"Gofun\" (powdered calcium carbonate that is made from cured oyster, clam or scallop shells) is an important material used in \"nihonga\". Different kinds of \"gofun\" are utilized as a ground, for under-painting, and as a fine white top color.\n\nInitially, \"nihonga\" were produced for hanging scrolls (\"kakemono\"), hand scrolls (\"emakimono\"), sliding doors (\"fusuma\") or folding screens (\"byōbu\"). However, most are now produced on paper stretched onto wood panels, suitable for framing. Nihonga paintings do not need to be put under glass. They are archival for thousands of years.\n\nIn monochrome \"Nihonga\", the technique depends on the modulation of ink tones from darker through lighter to obtain a variety of shadings from near white, through grey tones to black and occasionally into greenish tones to represent trees, water, mountains or foliage. In polychrome \"Nihonga\", great emphasis is placed on the presence or absence of outlines; typically outlines are not used for depictions of birds or plants. Occasionally, washes and layering of pigments are used to provide contrasting effects, and even more occasionally, gold or silver leaf may also be incorporated into the painting.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10286355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10286355", "title": "Primary Colors (film)", "text": "Primary Colors (film)\n\nPrimary Colors is a 1998 American comedy-drama film directed by Mike Nichols. The screenplay by Elaine May was adapted from the novel \"Primary Colors: A Novel of Politics\", a \"roman à clef\" about Bill Clinton's first presidential campaign in 1992, which was originally published anonymously, but in 1996 was revealed to have been written by journalist Joe Klein, who had been covering Clinton's campaign for \"Newsweek\". The film starred John Travolta, Emma Thompson, Billy Bob Thornton, Kathy Bates, Maura Tierney, Larry Hagman and Adrian Lester. \n\nIt was critically acclaimed but was a box office bomb, earning $52 million from a $65 million budget. Bates was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance, and May was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nYoung political idealist and grandson of a civil rights leader Henry Burton (Adrian Lester) is recruited to join the campaign of Jack Stanton (John Travolta), a charismatic Southern governor who is trying to win the Democratic Party nomination for President of the United States. Henry is impressed by Stanton's genuine warmth and empathy with people. He joins Stanton's inner circle of political advisers: Stanton's formidable wife, Susan Stanton (Emma Thompson); ruthless political strategist Richard Jemmons (Billy Bob Thornton); intelligent and attractive spokeswoman Daisy Green (Maura Tierney); and sly political operator Howard Ferguson (Paul Guilfoyle) as they journey to New Hampshire, the first state to hold a presidential primary. \nAfter Stanton completes an impressive debate performance against his Democratic rivals, Henry’s ex-girlfriend shows up to question Stanton about his arrest for an anti-war protest during the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago. In addition it's revealed that Stanton called a U.S. senator to help him get released then Stanton persuaded the mayor of Chicago to have his police record expunged. The team becomes worried that Stanton’s past indiscretions may be used against him by the press and his political opponents. They hire Jack and Susan's old friend, tough but unbalanced Libby Holden (Kathy Bates), to investigate allegations that could be used by Stanton's political opponents to undermine his candidacy such as Stanton's notorious womanizing. One of Stanton's mistresses and Susan's hairdresser, Cashmere McLeod (Gia Carides), produces secret taped conversations between them to prove they had an affair. Henry discovers that the tapes have been doctored, so Libby tracks down the man responsible for the tapes and forces him at gunpoint to confess his guilt in a signed letter to the American public.\n\nThe campaign is then rocked by a fresh allegation when Stanton's old friend, \"Big Willie\" McCollister (Tommy Hollis) approaches Henry to tell him that his 17-year-old daughter Loretta (who worked for the Stantons as a babysitter) is pregnant and that Stanton is the father. Henry and Howard tell Willie he must allow his daughter to undergo an amniocentesis to determine paternity. Although they convince Willie to remain silent on the issue, Henry is nonetheless sickened and disillusioned with the experience.\n\nRealizing the campaign is falling behind in the polls, Stanton's team adopt a new strategy. Stanton begins going on the offensive by attacking his nearest rival, Senator Lawrence Harris (Kevin Cooney) for casting anti-Israel votes and favoring cuts in Social Security and Medicare. Harris confronts Stanton during a radio talk show in Florida but suffers two heart attacks after the encounter. He suffers a medical setback, subsequently withdraws from the race, and is replaced by his friend, former Florida governor Fred Picker (Larry Hagman). Picker's wholesome, straight-talking image proves an immediate threat to the Stanton campaign. \nJack and Susan send Henry and Libby on an opposition research mission on Picker's past. They discover from his ex-brother-in-law, Eduardo Reyes (Tony Shalhoub), that Picker had a cocaine addiction as governor, which led to the disintegration of his first marriage. They also meet with Picker's cocaine supplier Lorenzo Delgado (John Vargas), with whom Picker had a homosexual affair. Not expecting the information to ever be used, Libby and Henry share their findings with Jack and Susan, but are dismayed when they both decide to leak the information to the press. Libby says that if Jack does so, she will reveal that he tampered with the results of the paternity test, proving that he slept with Willie's daughter. Libby commits suicide after she realizes she spent her life idealizing Jack and Susan only to learn how flawed they truly are. Racked with guilt over Libby's death, Stanton takes the incriminating information to Picker, and apologizes for seeking it out. Picker admits to his past indiscretions, and agrees to withdraw from the race and to endorse Stanton. Henry intends to quit the campaign, admitting he has become deeply disillusioned with the whole political process. Stanton begs Henry to reconsider, persuading him that the two of them can make history.\n\nMonths later, President Stanton is dancing at the Inaugural Ball with First Lady, Susan. He shakes the hands of all his campaign staff, the last of whom is Henry.\n\n\nFollowing the publication of the book in 1996, director Mike Nichols paid more than $1 million for the screen rights. The film was scripted by Elaine May, who had collaborated with Nichols in a comedy double-act in the 1950s and 60s.\n\nAt the Cannes Festival, Thompson said she did not base her performance on Hillary Clinton, while Travolta said he based his on several presidents, but mostly on Bill Clinton.\n\nNichols was criticized for cutting an interracial love scene from the final version of the film. He responded that he had removed the scene because of unfavorable reactions from a preview audience.\n\nThe film also generated controversy for its depiction of a Clinton-like character as it was also released close to the Lewinsky scandal.\n\nThe film received a positive reception from critics. \"Variety'\"s reviewer called it a \"film à clef\" and said that the American public was likely to accept it as a factual account because it so closely mirrored real life characters and events. The \"Los Angeles Times\" gave high marks to the movie, noting Travolta's close mirroring of Bill Clinton, but describing Thompson's character as actually not based on Hillary Clinton. \"Entertainment Weekly\" called Travolta \"Clintonian\". \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\" gave accolades to the character portrayals of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Syndicated reviewer Roger Ebert said the movie was \"insightful and very wise about the realities of political life\" and \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\" said the film was a \"nuanced dissection of how real American politics work\".\n\nIn a negative review, Jeff Vice of the \"Deseret News\" wrote that the last half of the movie dragged, Travolta's performance seemed more like an impersonation than actual acting, the movie lacked subtlety or depth, and it was loaded with cheap and obvious jokes. Nevertheless, Vice wrote that \"solid support is provided by Maura Tierney, Larry Hagman, and Stacy Edwards\".\n\n\"Primary Colors\" currently holds an 80% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 75 reviews.\n\nThe film earned a disappointing box office gross, only taking $39 million domestically and $13 million in foreign markets, for a worldwide total gross of $52 million against a budget of $65 million.\n\nThe soundtrack album, featuring music by and produced by Ry Cooder, was released in March 1998.\n\n"}

It is geared toward increasing voter turnout among voters ages 18 to 24. Rock the Vote is known for its celebrity spokespeople and its partnership with MTV.\n\nRock the Vote was founded in 1990 by Jeff Ayeroff with Virgin America co Chair Jordan Harris and Virgin Executive Beverly Lund. Later they hired Jodi Uttal and then Steve Barr, a campaign worker and political fundraiser, who became \"co-founders\" for their contribution to Rock the Vote.\nRock the Vote supported the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, commonly referred to as the \"motor voter\" bill, which expanded access to voter registration. It was signed into law by President Bill Clinton. The law requires state governments to offer voter registration opportunities to any eligible person who applies for or renews a driver's license or public assistance.\n\nIn 1996, Rock the Vote created the first telephone voter registration system, 1-800-REGISTER, followed by the first online voter-registration system, NetVote, later that year.\n\n\"We supported Rock the Vote,\" said Radiohead's Thom Yorke, \"but – because of the way the whole political system works – it does seem rather odd to be choosing between one unworkable, outdated system and another. We need to go beyond that – because, at the moment, it's just Cowboys and Indians.\"\n\nWith CNN, Rock the Vote organized \"America Rocks the Vote,\" a 2003 Democratic presidential candidates forum at Faneuil Hall in Boston.\n\nRock the Vote has expressed support for a public health insurance option. It signed on to Health Care for America NOW!, a progressive political coalition that supported passage of the Affordable Care Act. In 2009, Rock the Vote ran a campaign encouraging people to refuse to have sex with those who opposed what they regarded as a reform of American health care.\n\nDuring the 2004 presidential election, Rock the Vote drew criticism from Republican Party officials such as Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie for sending a mock draft notice to over 600,000 e-mail addresses. The message included the words \"Selective Service System\" and read \"You are hereby ordered for induction into the Armed Forces of the United States, and to report to a polling place near you\" on November 2, (Election Day). The Rock the Vote logo and a facsimile of Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's signature appeared at the bottom of the message. In addition, Rock the Vote created public service announcements featuring the subject of the draft. Besides making the PSAs available to large cable systems, they also paid to run them on a random sample of small cable systems where they could measure the effects. Turnout was three percentage points higher among 18-19-year olds in these sample areas than in the control group covered by other similar small cable systems; there was less effect above age 22.\n\nAccording to the \"Los Angeles Times\", Rock the Vote experienced financial problems in the aftermath of the 2004 election. It emerged from the election $700,000 in debt, and its president resigned in the summer of 2005 \"amid disagreements about the organization's direction.\"\n\nIn 2008, Rock the Vote ran the largest non-partisan youth voter registration drive in the nation's history by getting 2.6 million young voters registered.\n\nIn November 2012 and 2013 Rock the Vote experimented with Facebook ads to encourage voter turnout by telling people the number of days remaining until the election and which of their friends \"liked\" the countdown. The ads were shown to over 400,000 adults, randomly selected from a base over 800,000. Rock the Vote had helped many of them register. The ads did not increase turnout in the experimental group, compared to the control group who did not get the ads. In 2012 they also experimented with text message reminders to 180,000 people who had provided their mobile numbers. Texts the day before the election raised turnout six tenths of a percentage point, while texts on election day lowered turnout.\n\nIn advance of the 2014 elections, Rock the Vote released a video titled \"Turn Out For What.\" It was a parody of Lil Jon and DJ Snake's song \"Turn Down for What\". The video sought to encourage youth voter turnout and featured reproductive rights, marijuana legalization, global warming, LGBT rights, student debt, gun control and deforestation as reasons why young people might want to vote. The video was criticized by some Republicans who said it had a disproportionate representation of liberal issues. The video was also criticized because several of the celebrities who appeared in it, including Lena Dunham, Whoopi Goldberg, Natasha Lyonne and Darren Criss, had not voted in the previous midterm election.\n\nThe day after the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Rock the Vote President and Executive Director Carolyn DeWitt issued a statement on behalf of the organization expressing disappointment with the election of Donald Trump and Republican Party congressional victories.\n\nRock the Vote: Democracy Class is a program put on by Rock the Vote. It is designed to educate high school students about voting, elections and governance. The nonpartisan lesson plan uses music, pop culture, video, classroom discussion and a mock election to teach young people the skills to navigate the elections process and engage as active citizens. On Democracy Day 2011, teachers in all 50 states committed to teaching Democracy Class in more than 1,100 classrooms. High school students in Democracy Classes participate in mobile polls that assess their viewpoints on public policy issues.\n\nThis is a partial list of celebrities who have appeared in public service announcements for Rock the Vote.\n"}

The 16th Disney animated feature film, it was released to theaters on January 29, 1959, by Buena Vista Distribution. This was the last Disney adaptation of a fairy tale for some years because of its initial mixed critical reception and underperformance at the box office; the studio did not return to the genre until 30 years later, after Walt Disney died in 1966, with the release of \"The Little Mermaid\" (1989).\n\nIt features the voices of Mary Costa, Eleanor Audley, Verna Felton, Barbara Luddy, Barbara Jo Allen, Bill Shirley, Taylor Holmes, and Bill Thompson.\n\nThe film was directed by Les Clark, Eric Larson, and Wolfgang Reitherman, under the supervision of Clyde Geronimi, with additional story work by Joe Rinaldi, Winston Hibler, Bill Peet, Ted Sears, Ralph Wright, and Milt Banta. The film's musical score and songs, featuring the work of the Graunke Symphony Orchestra under the direction of George Bruns, are arrangements or adaptations of numbers from the 1890 \"Sleeping Beauty\" ballet by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. However, unlike the previous feature-films, this was the first Disney feature-film that did not have the same background animation material, but instead with new background animation material.\n\n\"Sleeping Beauty\" was the first animated film to be photographed in the Super Technirama 70 widescreen process, as well as the second full-length animated feature film to be filmed in anamorphic widescreen, following Disney's own \"Lady and the Tramp\" four years earlier. The film was presented in Super Technirama 70 and 6-channel stereophonic sound in first-run engagements.\n\nAfter many childless years, King Stefan and Queen Leah happily welcome the birth of their daughter, the Princess Aurora. They proclaim a holiday for their subjects to pay homage to the princess and at the gathering for her christening she is betrothed to Prince Phillip, the young son of King Stefan's best friend King Hubert, so that their kingdoms will be forever united.\n\nAmong the guests are the three good fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, who have come to bless the child with gifts. Flora and Fauna give their gifts of beauty and song, respectively. But before Merryweather is able to give her blessing, the evil witch Maleficent appears, only to be told that she was not invited. Maleficent turns to leave, but when Queen Leah asks if she's offended, the evil witch curses the princess, proclaiming that Aurora will grow in grace and beauty, but before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, she will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die. King Stefan and Queen Leah are horrified and beg the fairies to undo the curse. Unfortunately, they are not powerful enough to do so, but Merryweather uses her blessing to weaken the curse so that instead of dying, Aurora will fall into a deep sleep from which she can only be awakened by true love's first kiss. King Stefan, still fearful for his daughter's life, orders all spinning wheels throughout the kingdom to be burned. The fairies do not believe that it will be enough to keep Aurora safe, and so, with the reluctant acceptance of King Stefan and Queen Leah, they bring her away to a woodcutter's cottage in the forest until the day of her sixteenth birthday.\n\nYears later, Aurora, renamed Briar Rose, has grown into a beautiful young woman. On the day of her sixteenth birthday, the three fairies ask her to gather berries in the forest so they can prepare a surprise party for her. Aurora befriends the animals of the forest and sings them a song, \"Once Upon a Dream\". While singing in the forest, Aurora attracts the attention of Phillip, now a handsome young man. He races to find the origin of the beautiful voice and is instantly struck by Aurora's grace and beauty. Aurora at first is frightened at his sudden appearance, as she is not allowed to talk to strangers, but Phillip soon puts her at ease. They instantly fall in love, unaware of being promised in marriage sixteen years ago. Aurora asks Phillip to come to her cottage that evening and meet her family.\n\nMeanwhile, Flora and Merryweather argue over the color of Aurora's ball gown, which attracts the attention of Maleficent's raven, revealing the location of Aurora. Back at home, Aurora is thrilled to tell her guardians that she met a man and fell in love with him. The fairies finally tell Aurora the truth about her royal heritage, that she is a princess and already betrothed at birth to a prince, and tell her she must never see the man she met again. Heartbroken, she cries in her room. Meanwhile, Phillip tells his father of a peasant girl he met and wishes to marry in spite of his prearranged marriage to Aurora. King Hubert fails to convince his son otherwise, leaving him in equal disappointment.\n\nLater that night, the fairies take Aurora back to the castle and leave her alone in a room to wait for her birthday celebrations where she will finally get to see her parents. Maleficent then appears and magically lures Aurora into a dark tower room away from the fairies and tricks the princess into touching the spindle of a cursed spinning wheel. Aurora pricks her finger, fulfilling the curse. The three fairies place Aurora on a bed in the highest tower and place a powerful spell on all the people in the kingdom, causing them to fall asleep until the spell on their princess is broken. While doing so, they overhear a sleepy conversation between the two kings. From King Hubert's conversation with King Stefan, the fairies realize that Phillip is the man with whom Aurora has fallen in love. They rush to find him, but he is abducted by Maleficent who is waiting for him at the cottage in the forest. She shows Phillip the peasant girl he fell in love with is the now-sleeping princess. She tells him she plans to keep him locked away for a century until he's an old man on the verge of death, then release him to meet his love, who will not have even aged a single day.\n\nThe fairies find and release Phillip, arming him with the magical Sword of Truth and the Shield of Virtue. An enraged Maleficent tries to stop Phillip by surrounding Stefan's castle with thorns, but fails. She then teleports herself in front of him and transforms into a gigantic dragon. Eventually, Phillip throws the sword, blessed by the fairies' magic, directly into Maleficent's heart, causing her to fall to her death.\n\nPhillip awakens Aurora with a kiss, breaking the spell and thereby waking everyone in the castle. The royal couple descends to the ballroom, where Aurora is happily reunited with her parents, while King Hubert is confused of how the two young royals met. Flora and Merryweather resume their petty argument over the color of Aurora's ball gown, magically changing it from blue to pink while the happy couple waltzes. The last color to appear is pink. The scene then fades to Aurora and Phillip dancing then kissing on a cloud. They all live happily ever after.\n\nEric Larson did not animate any of the characters for the film; instead, he directed the entire \"Forest\" sequence which stretches from Briar Rose (a.k.a. Aurora) wandering through the forest with her animal friends all the way to Princess Aurora renamed Briar Rose running back home, promising Phillip they will meet again later in the evening. This was the only time Larson directed a sequence or a film during his tenure at Walt Disney Productions.\n\nFollowing the critical and commercial success of \"Cinderella\", writing for \"Sleeping Beauty\" began in early 1951. Partial story elements originated from discarded ideas for \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" including Maleficent's capture of Prince Philip and his dramatic escape from her fortress and \"Cinderella\" where a fantasy sequence featured the leading protagonists dancing on a cloud which was developed, but eventually dropped from the film. By the middle of 1953, director Wilfred Jackson had recorded the dialogue, assembled a story reel, and was to commence for preliminary animation work where Princess Aurora and Prince Phillip were to meet in the forest and dance, though Walt Disney decided to throw out the sequence delaying the film from its initial 1955 release date. For a number of months, Jackson, Ted Sears, and two story writers underwent a rewrite of the story, which received a lukewarm response from Disney. During the story rewriting process, the story writers felt the original fairy tale's second act felt bizarre and with the wake-up kiss serving as a climactic moment, they decided to concentrate on the first half finding strength in the romance. However, they felt little romance was developed between the strange prince and the princess that the storyboard artists worked out an elaborate sequence in which the king organized a treasure hunt. The idea was eventually dropped when it became too drawn out and drifted from the central storyline. Instead, it was written that Prince Phillip and Princess Aurora would meet in the forest by random chance while Princess Aurora renamed Briar Rose was conversing with the forest animals. Additionally, because the original Perrault tale had the curse last one hundred years, the writers decided to shorten it a few hours with the time spent for Prince Phillip to battle the goons, overcome several obstacles, and fight off against Maleficent transformed into a dragon.\n\nThe name given to the princess by her royal birth parents is \"Aurora\" (Latin for \"dawn\"), as it was in the original Tchaikovsky ballet. This name occurred in Charles Perrault's version as well, not as the princess's name, but as her daughter's. In hiding, she is called Briar Rose, the name of the princess in the Brothers Grimm's version variant. The prince was given the princely name most familiar to Americans in the 1950s: Prince Phillip. Named after Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, the character has the distinction of being the first Disney prince to have a name as the two princes in \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" (The Prince) and \"Cinderella\" (Prince Charming) are never named.\n\nIn December 1953, Jackson suffered a heart attack, as a result of which directing animator Eric Larson of Disney's Nine Old Men took over as director. By April 1954, \"Sleeping Beauty\" was scheduled for a February 1957 release. With Larson as the director, Disney instructed Larson, whose unit would animate the forest sequence, that the picture was to be a \"moving illustration, the ultimate in animation\" and added that he did not care how long it would take. Because of the delays, the release date was again pushed back from Christmas 1957 to Christmas 1958. Fellow Nine Old Men Milt Kahl would blame Walt for the numerous release delays because \"he wouldn’t have story meetings. He wouldn't get the damn thing moving.\" Relatively late in production, Disney removed Larson as the supervising director and replaced him with Clyde Geronimi. Directing animator Wolfgang Reitherman would join Geronimi as sequence director over the climactic dragon battle sequence commenting that \"We took the approach that we were going to kill that damned prince!\". Les Clark, another member of the Nine Old Men, would serve as the sequence director of the elaborate opening scene where crowds of the citizens in the kingdom arrive at the palace for the presentation of Princess Aurora.\n\nThe animation style moved away from the Rococo of \"Cinderella\" and also does not simply draw on fashion and female beauty standards of the time and draws upon distinctive visual combination of Medieval art imagery and Art Deco design which makes for a lush and nuanced visual experience.\nKay Neilsen–whose sketches were the basis for \"Night on Bald Mountain\" in \"Fantasia\"–was the first to produce styling sketches for the film in 1952. The artistic style originated when John Hench observed the famed unicorn tapestries at the Cloisters located at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. When Hench returned to the Disney studios, he brought reproductions of the tapestries and showed them to Walt Disney, who replied, \"Yeah, we could use that style for \"Sleeping Beauty\".\"\n\nEyvind Earle joined Walt Disney Productions in 1951 first employed as an assistant background painter for \"Peter Pan\" before being promoted as a full-fledged background painter in the Goofy cartoon, \"For Whom the Bulls Toil\" and the color stylist of the Academy Award-winning short, \"Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom\". For \"Sleeping Beauty\", Earle said he \"felt totally free to put my own style\" into the paintings he based on Hench's drawings stating \"Where his trees might have curved, I straightened them out…. I took a Hench and took the same subject, and the composition he had, and just turned in into my style.\" Furthermore, Earle found inspiration in Italian Renaissance utilizing works from Albrecht Dürer, Pieter Bruegel, Nicolaas van Eyck, Sandro Botticelli, as well as Persian art and Japanese prints. When Geronimi became the supervising director, Earle and Geronimi entered furious creative differences. Geronimi commented that he felt Earle's paintings \"lacked the mood in a lot of things. All that beautiful detail in the trees, the bark, and all that, that's all well and good, but who the hell's going to look at that? The backgrounds became more important than the animation. He'd made them more like Christmas cards.\" Earle left the Disney studios in March 1958, before \"Sleeping Beauty\" was completed, to take a job at John Sutherland Productions. As a result, Geronimi had Earle's background paintings softened and diluted from their distinctive medieval texture.\n\nBefore the animation process began, a live-action reference version was filmed with live actors in costume serving as models for the animators in which Walt Disney insisted on because he wanted the characters to appear \"as real as possible, near flesh-and-blood.\" However, Milt Kahl objected to this method, calling it \"a crutch, a stifling of the creative effort. Anyone worth his salt in this business ought to \"know\" how people move.\" Helene Stanley was the live action reference for Princess Aurora. The only known surviving footage of Stanley as Aurora's live-action reference is a clip from the television program \"Disneyland\", which consists of the artists sketching her dancing with the woodland animals. Stanley previously provided live-action references for \"Cinderella\" and later for Anita from \"101 Dalmatians\", and portrayed Polly Crockett for the TV series \"Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier\".\n\nThe role of Prince Phillip was modeled by Ed Kemmer, who had played Commander Buzz Corry on television's \"Space Patrol\" five years before \"Sleeping Beauty\" was released. For the final battle sequence, Kemmer was photographed on a wooden buck. The live-action model for Maleficent was Eleanor Audley, who also voiced the villain. Dancer Jane Fowler also was a live-action reference for Maleficent. Among the actresses who performed in reference footage for this film were Spring Byington and Frances Bavier.\n\nBecause of the artistic depth of Earle's backgrounds, it was decided for the characters to be stylized so they could appropriately match the backgrounds. While the layout artists and animators were impressed with Earles's paintings, they eventually grew depressed at working with a style that many of them regarded as too cold, too flat, and too modernist for a fairy tale. Nevertheless, Walt insisted on the visual design claiming that the inspirational art he commissioned in the past had homogenized the animators. Frank Thomas would complain to Ken Peterson, head of the animation department, of Earles's \"very rigid design\" because of the inhibiting effect on the animators that was less problematic than working with Mary Blair's designs, in which Peterson would respond that the design style was Walt's decision, and that, like it or not, they had to use it. Because of this, Thomas developed a red blotch on his face and had to visit the doctor each week to have it attended to. Production designer Ken Anderson also complained: \"I had to fight myself to make myself draw that way.\" Another character animator on Aurora claimed their unit was so cautious about the drawings that the clean-up animators produced one drawing a day, which translated into one second of screen time per month.\n\nMeanwhile, Tom Oreb was tasked as character stylist that would not only inhabit the style of the backgrounds, but also fit with the contemporary UPA style. Likewise with Earle's background styling, the animators complained that the character designs were too rigid to animate. For Maleficent, Marc Davis drew from Czechoslovakian religious paintings and used \"the red and black drapery in the back that looked like flames that I thought would be great to use. I took the idea of the collar partly from a bat, and the horns looked like a devil.\" However, in an act of artistic compromise, Earle, with final approval on the character designs, requested the change to lavender as red would come off too strong, in which Davis agreed to. In addition, Davis served as directing animator over the title character with the character's figure and features based on those of Audrey Hepburn as well as her voice actress, Mary Costa.\n\nVeteran animators Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston were assigned as directing animators over the three good fairies: Flora, Fauna and Merryweather. Walt Disney urged for the fairies to be more homogeneous, which Thomas and Johnston objected to, with Thomas stating they \"thought 'that's not going to be any fun'. So we started figuring the other way and worked on how we could develop them into special personalities.\" John Lounsbery would animate the \"Skumps\" sequence between Kings Hubert and Stefan. Chuck Jones, known for his work as an animation director with Warner Bros. Cartoons, was employed on the film for four months during its early conceptual stages when Warner Bros. Cartoons was closed when it was anticipated that 3-D film would replace animation as a box office draw. Following the failure of 3-D, and the reversal of Warner's decision, Jones returned to the other studio. His work on \"Sleeping Beauty\", which he spent four months on, remained uncredited. Ironically, during his early years at Warner Bros., Jones was a heavy user of Disney-style animation until Tex Avery got Warner out of the Disney style. Another notable animator who worked on the film for part of its production was Don Bluth, who worked as an assistant animator to John Lounsberry, Bluth would leave after two years but eventually came back in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1952, Mary Costa was invited to a dinner party where she sang \"When I Fall in Love\" at the then-named Los Angeles Conservatory of Music. Following the performance, she was approached by Walter Schumann who told her, \"I don't want to shock you, but I've been looking (for Aurora) for three years, and I want to set up an audition. Would you do it?\" Costa accepted the offer, and at her audition in the recording booth with George Bruns, she was asked to sing and do a bird call, which she did initially in her Southern accent until she was advised to do an English accent. The next day, she was informed by Walt Disney that she landed the role. Eleanor Audley initially turned down the choice role of Maleficent as she was battling tuberculosis at the time, but reconsidered.\n\nIn April 1952, \"Billboard\" reported that Jack Lawrence and Sammy Fain had signed to compose the score. Walter Schumann was originally slated to be the film composer, but left the project because of creative differences with Walt Disney. George Bruns was recommended to replace Schumannn by animator Ward Kimball. Because of a musicians' strike in 1957, the musical score was recorded in Berlin, Germany.\n\nTrack list:\n\nThe \"\" album includes \"Once Upon a Dream\" on the green disc, and \"I Wonder\" on the purple disc. Additionally, \"Disney's Greatest Hits\" includes \"Once Upon a Dream\" on the blue disc. The 1973 LP compilation \"50 Happy Years of Disney Favorites\" (Disneyland, STER-3513) includes \"Once Upon a Dream\" as the seventh track on Side IV, as well as a track titled \"Blue Bird – I Wonder\" labeled as being from this film with authorship by Hibler, Sears, and Bruns (same set, Side II, track 4).\n\nAlthough Bruns took much credit for the score, he derived most of his work from the themes and melodies in Tchaikovsky's ballet \"Sleeping Beauty\".\nYma Sumac covered \"I Wonder\" for Stay Awake in 1988. \nNo Secrets performed a cover version of \"Once Upon a Dream\" on the album \"Disneymania 2\", which appears as a music video on the 2003 DVD. More recently, Emily Osment sang a remake of \"Once Upon a Dream\", released on the Disney Channel on September 12, 2008, and included on the Platinum Edition DVD and Blu-ray Disc.\n\nIn the 2012 album \"Disney – Koe no Oujisama\", which features various Japanese voice actors covering Disney songs, \"Once Upon a Dream\" was covered by Toshiyuki Morikawa.\n\nIn anticipation of the 2014 film \"Maleficent\", a cover version sung by Lana Del Rey was released by Disney on January 26. The song is considerably darker and more dramatic than the 1959 version, given the new film's focus on the villain Maleficent. The song was debuted in a trailer for the film shown as a commercial break during the 2014 Grammy Awards, and was released for free on Google Play for a limited time.\n\nDisney's distribution arm, Buena Vista Distribution, originally released \"Sleeping Beauty\" to theaters in both standard 35mm prints and large-format 70mm prints. The Super Technirama 70 prints were equipped with six-track stereophonic sound; some CinemaScope-compatible 35mm Technirama prints were released in four-track stereo, and others had monaural soundtracks. On the initial run, \"Sleeping Beauty\" was paired with the short musical/documentary film \"Grand Canyon\" which won an Academy Award.\n\nDuring its original release in January 1959, \"Sleeping Beauty\" grossed approximately $5.3 million in theater rentals (the distributor's share of the box office gross). \"Sleeping Beauty's\" production costs, which totaled $6 million, made it the most expensive Disney film up to that point, and over twice as expensive as each of the preceding three Disney animated features: \"Alice in Wonderland\", \"Peter Pan\", and \"Lady and the Tramp\". The high production costs of \"Sleeping Beauty\", coupled with the underperformance of much of the rest of Disney's 1959–1960 release slate, resulted in the company posting its first annual loss in a decade for fiscal year 1960, and there were massive lay-offs throughout the animation department.\n\nLike \"Alice in Wonderland\" (1951), which was not initially successful either, \"Sleeping Beauty\" was never re-released theatrically in Walt Disney's lifetime. However, it had many re-releases in theaters over the decades. The film was re-released theatrically in 1970, where it was released on standard 35mm film. The release garnered $3.8 million. It was re-released in 1979 in 70mm 6 channel stereo, as well as in 35 mm stereo and mono, 1986, and 1995. It was originally going to be re-released in 1993 (as was advertised on the 1992 VHS release of \"Beauty and the Beast\") but it was cancelled and pushed forward two years later to 1995. \"Sleeping Beauty\"s successful reissues have made it the second most successful film released in 1959, second to \"Ben-Hur\", with a lifetime gross of $51.6 million. When adjusted for ticket price inflation, the domestic total gross comes out to $623.56 million, placing it in the top 40 of films.\n\nFrom July 9 to August 13, 2012, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences organized \"The Last 70MM Film Festival\" at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater, where the Academy, its members, and the Hollywood industry acknowledged the importance, beauty, and majesty of the 70mm film format and how its image and quality is superior to that of digital film. The Academy selected the following films, which were shot on 70mm, to be screened to make a statement about it, as well as to gain a new appreciation for familiar films in a way it hadn't before: \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\", \"Sleeping Beauty\", \"Grand Prix\", \"The Sound of Music\", \"\", and \"Spartacus\", along with other short subject films on the 70mm format. A screening of the final remaining 70mm print of this film was included in the 70mm & Widescreen Film Festival at the Somerville Theatre, September 18, 2016.\n\nUpon its initial release, \"Sleeping Beauty\" received mixed to positive reviews from film critics. Bosley Crowther, writing in his review for \"The New York Times\", complimented that \"the colors are rich, the sounds are luscious and magic sparkles spurt charmingly from wands\", but criticized its familiarity with \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\". He further wrote that \"the princess looks so much like Snow White they could be a couple of Miss Rheingolds separated by three or four years. And she has the same magical rapport with the little creatures of the woods. The witch is the same slant-eyed Circe who worked her evil on Snow White. And the three good fairies could be maiden sisters of the misogynistic seven dwarfs.\" \"Variety\" praised the singing voices of Mary Costa and Bill Shirley and noted that \"some of the best parts of the picture are those dealing with the three good fairies, spoken and sung by Verna Felton, Barbara Jo Allen and Barbara Luddy.\" \"The New York Daily News\" described the film as \"enchanting\".\n\nNevertheless, the film has sustained a strong following and is today hailed as one of the best animated films ever made, thanks to its stylized designs by painter Eyvind Earle who also was the art director for the film, its lush music score, the character of Maleficent (whose popularity led her to be the flagship villain for the Disney Villains franchise), and its large-format 70mm widescreen and stereophonic sound presentation. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that the film received an 91% approval rating with an average rating of 8.2/10 based on 38 reviews. Its consensus states that \"This Disney dreamscape contains moments of grandeur, with its lush colors, magical air, one of the most menacing villains in the Disney canon.\" Carrie R. Wheadon of Common Sense Media gave the film five out of five stars, writing, \"Disney classic is delightful but sometimes scary\".\n\nAcademy Awards\n\nGrammy Awards\n\nYoung Artist Award\n\nOther honors\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\n\"Sleeping Beauty\" was released on VHS, Betamax, and Laserdisc on October 14, 1986 in the Classics collection, becoming the first Disney Classics video to be digitally processed in Hi-Fi stereo. During its 1986 VHS release, it sold over a million copies. The release went into moratorium on March 31, 1988.\n\nThe film underwent a digital restoration in 1997, and that version was released to both VHS and Laserdisc in widescreen as part of the Masterpiece Collection. The 1997 VHS edition also came with a special commemorative booklet included, with brief facts on the making of the movie.\n\nIn 2003, the restored \"Sleeping Beauty\" was released to DVD in a 2-disc \"Special Edition\" which included both a widescreen version (formatted at 2.35:1) and a pan and scan version as well. Its DVD supplements included the making-of featurette from the 1997 VHS, \"Grand Canyon\", the \"Life of Tchaikovsky\" segment of \"The Peter Tchaikovsky Story\" from the Walt Disney anthology television series, a virtual gallery of concept art, layout and background designs, three trailers, and audio commentary from Mary Costa, Eyvind Earle, and Ollie Johnston.\n\nA Platinum Edition release of \"Sleeping Beauty\", as a 2-disc DVD and Blu-ray, was released on October 7, 2008 in the US, making \"Sleeping Beauty\" the first entry in the Platinum Edition line to be released in high definition video. This release is based upon the 2007 restoration of \"Sleeping Beauty\" from the original Technicolor negatives (interpositives several generations removed from the original negative were used for other home video releases). The new restoration features the film in its full negative aspect ratio of 2.55:1, wider than both the prints shown at the film's original limited Technirama engagements in 2.20:1 and the CinemaScope-compatible reduction prints for general release at 2.35:1. The Blu-ray set features BD-Live, an online feature, and the extras include a virtual castle and multi-player games. The Blu-ray release also includes disc 1 of the DVD version of the film in addition to the two Blu-rays. The DVD includes a music video with a remake of the Disney Classic \"Once Upon A Dream\" sung by Emily Osment; and featuring Daniel Romer as Prince Philip. The DVD was released on October 27, 2008 in the UK. The Blu-ray release is the first ever released on the Blu-ray format of any Disney feature produced by Walt Disney himself. The film was released on a Diamond Edition Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital HD on October 7, 2014, after six years since its first time on Blu-ray.\n\nAurora is one of the seven Princesses of Heart in the popular Square Enix game \"Kingdom Hearts\" (although her appearances are brief), and Maleficent is a villain in all three \"Kingdom Hearts\" games, and as a brief ally at the third game's climax. The good fairies appear in \"Kingdom Hearts II\", giving Sora new clothes. Diablo appears in \"Kingdom Hearts II\" to resurrect his defeated mistress. The PSP game \"Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep\" features a world based on the movie, Enchanted Dominion, and characters who appear are Princess Aurora/Briar Rose, Maleficent, Maleficent's goons, the three faires and Prince Phillip, the latter serving as temporary party member for Aqua during her battle against Maleficent and her henchmen. Maleficent will return in \"Kingdom Hearts III\".\n\nAurora is also a playable character in the game \"Disney Princess\".\n\n\"Walt Disney's Sleeping Beauty Game\" (1958) is a Parker Brothers children's board game for two to four players based upon \"Sleeping Beauty\". The object of the game is to be the first player holding three different picture cards to reach the castle and the space marked \"The End\".\n\nThe Disney film retains the basics of Charles Perrault's 17th-century fairy tale about a princess cursed to sleep one hundred years, but adds three elderly fairies who protect the princess, a prince armed with a magic sword and shield, and other details. The Disney twists on the tale are incorporated into the game, and Disney's \"stunning graphics\" illustrate the game board. In addition to the board game, the film generated books, toys, and other juvenile merchandise.\n\nThe equipment consists of a center-seamed game board, four tokens in various colors, four spinners, four magic wands, and a deck of picture cards.\n\nThe first player moves the number of spaces along the track according to a dial spin. If the player lands on a pink star, his turn ends. If he lands on a yellow star, he draws a card and follows its instruction. If he draws a picture card, he retains it face down at his place. If a player spins a six, he is given the choice of moving six spaces or taking a magic wand. He may play the wand at any time during the game and in doing so draws two cards, following their instructions. A player must hold three different picture cards before entering the Path of Happiness. If he does not hold three picture cards, he continues around the Deep Sleep circle until he acquires the required three picture cards. Should a player land on a purple Maleficent space, that player returns one of his picture cards to the deck.\n\n\"Sleeping Beauty\" was made while Walt Disney was building Disneyland (hence the six-year production time). To help promote the film, Imagineers named the park's icon \"Sleeping Beauty Castle\" (it was originally to be Snow White's). An indoor walk-through exhibit was added to the empty castle interior in 1957, where guests could walk through the castle, up and over the castle entrance, viewing \"Story Moment\" dioramas of scenes from the film, which were improved with animated figurines in 1977. It closed shortly after the September 11, 2001 attacks, supposedly because the dark, unmonitored corridors were a risk. After being closed for seven years, the exhibit space underwent extensive refurbishment to restore the original 1957 displays, and reopened to guests on November 27, 2008. Accommodations were also made on the ground floor with a \"virtual\" version for disabled guests unable to navigate stairs. Hong Kong Disneyland opened in 2005, also with a Sleeping Beauty Castle, nearly replicating Disneyland's original design.\n\n\"Le Château de la Belle au Bois Dormant\" at Disneyland Paris is a variant of Sleeping Beauty Castle. The version found at Disneyland Paris is much more reminiscent of the film's artistic direction. The \"Château\" features an animatronic dragon, imagineered to look like Maleficent's dragon form, is found in the lower level dungeon – \"La Tanière du Dragon\". The building also contains \"La Galerie de la Belle au Bois Dormant\", a gallery of displays which illustrate the story of Sleeping Beauty in tapestries, stained glass windows and figures.\n\nPrincess Aurora (and, to a lesser extent, Prince Phillip, Fauna, Flora and Merryweather, Maleficent and her goons) makes regular appearances in the parks and parades.\n\nMaleficent is featured as one of the villains in the nighttime show \"Fantasmic!\" at Disneyland and Disney's Hollywood Studios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA scaled-down one act stage musical version of the film with the title \"Disney's Sleeping Beauty KIDS\" is often performed by schools and children's theaters. With book and additional lyrics by Marcy Heisler and Bryan Louiselle, the show is composed of twelve musical numbers, including the movie songs.\n\nIn Walt Disney Pictures' live action adaption \"Maleficent\", released in May 2014, Angelina Jolie plays the role of Maleficent and Elle Fanning plays Princess Aurora. The movie was directed by Robert Stromberg in his directorial debut, produced by Don Hahn and Joe Roth, and written by Linda Woolverton. A sequel to this film began production in May 2018.\n\n\n\n"}

The Star, along with Minerva and The Classic Theatre, were also one of the places where the first motion pictures in Bengal, made by Hira Lala Sen, were screened. This is a heritage site of Calcutta (Kolkata) that was destroyed in a fire and thereafter restored by the local municipal corporation. The restored Star Theatre maintains the heritage facade; the interiors are contemporary. The property is maintained by a private company. At present, it is primarily a cinema hall; plays are staged on about two days per month. However, during winter (December and January) plays are staged here much more frequently, of the order of ten days per month. The auditorium has excellent acoustics. Star Theatre is close to the junction of Grey Street (Aurobindo Saranee) and Cornwallis Street (Bidhan Saranee); the area near this junction is called Hatibagan (Elephant Park).

The best known of the treasure legends tied to the island is that of the Treasure of Lima: In 1820, with the army of José de San Martín approaching Lima, Viceroy José de la Serna entrusted the treasure from the city to British trader Captain William Thompson for safekeeping until the Spaniards could secure the country. Instead of waiting in the harbour as they were instructed, Thompson and his crew killed the Viceroy’s men and sailed to Cocos, where they buried the treasure. Shortly afterwards, they were apprehended by a Spanish warship.

{"id": "3287984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3287984", "title": "Wednesday Addams", "text": "Wednesday Addams\n\nWednesday Addams is a fictional character created by American cartoonist Charles Addams in his comic strip \"The Addams Family\". The character has also appeared in television and film, in both the live action and animated formats.\n\nIn Addams' cartoons, which first appeared in \"The New Yorker\", Wednesday and other members of the family had no names. When the characters were adapted to the 1964 television series, Charles Addams gave her the name \"Wednesday\", based on the well-known nursery rhyme line, \"Wednesday's child is full of woe.\" The idea for the name was supplied by the actress and poet Joan Blake, an acquaintance of Addams. She is the sister of Pugsley Addams (and, in the movie \"Addams Family Values\", also the sister of Pubert Addams), and she is the only daughter of Gomez and Morticia Addams.\n\nWednesday's most notable features are her pale skin and long, dark twin braids. She seldom shows emotion and is generally bitter. Wednesday usually wears a black dress with a white collar, black stockings and black shoes.\n\nIn the 1960s series, she is significantly more sweet-natured, although her favorite hobby is raising spiders; she is also a ballerina. Wednesday's favorite toy is her Marie Antoinette doll, which her brother guillotines (at her request). She is stated to be six years old in the television series' pilot episode. In one episode, she is shown to have several other headless dolls as well. She also paints pictures (including a picture of trees with human heads) and writes a poem dedicated to her favorite pet spider, Homer. Wednesday is deceptively strong; she is able to bring her father down with a judo hold.\n\nIn the 1991 film, she is depicted closer to the original cartoons. She shows sadistic tendencies and a dark personality, and is revealed to have a deep interest in the Bermuda Triangle and an admiration for an ancestor (Great Aunt Calpurnia Addams) who was burned as a witch in 1706. In the 1993 sequel, she was even darker: she buried a live cat, tried to kill her baby brother Pubert, set fire to Camp Chippewa and (possibly) scared fellow camper Joel to death.\n\nWednesday has a close kinship with the family's giant butler Lurch. In the TV series, her middle name is \"Friday\". In the Spanish version, her name is Miércoles (Wednesday in Spanish); in Latin America she is Merlina; in the Brazilian version she is Wandinha (little Wanda in Portuguese); in France her name is Mercredi (Wednesday in French) and in Italy her name is Mercoledì (Wednesday in Italian).\n\nIn the animated series and Canadian TV series \"The New Addams Family\" from the 1990s, Wednesday retains her appearance and her taste for darkness and torture.\n\nIn the Broadway musical \"\", she is 18 years old and has short hair rather than the long braids in her other appearances. Her darkness and sociopathic traits have been toned down, and she is in love with (and revealed to be engaged to) Lucas Beineke. In the musical Wednesday is older than Pugsley. \n\nIn the parody web series \"Adult Wednesday Addams\", Wednesday, as played by Melissa Hunter, recovers her dark, sociopathic and sadistic nature and her long braids, connecting with the events and the depiction of the movies and the original comic-book. This Wednesday deals with being an adult after moving out of her family home. The web series gained media attention with the third episode of Season 2 in which Wednesday punished a pair of catcallers. The Tee & Charles Addams Foundation, copyright owners of The Addams Family, flagged the series for copyright violation resulting in the series being pulled from YouTube. \n\n\nOver the years, Wednesday has been portrayed by a variety of actresses, on television, the movies, and stage:\n"}
{"id": "191021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=191021", "title": "William Kempe", "text": "William Kempe\n\nWilliam Kempe (died 1603), commonly referred to as Will Kemp, was an English actor and dancer specialising in comic roles and best known for having been one of the original players in early dramas by William Shakespeare. Roles associated with his name may include the great comic creation, Falstaff, and his contemporaries considered him the successor to the great clown of the previous generation, Richard Tarlton.\n\nKempe's success and influence was such that in December 1598 he was one of a core of five actor-shareholders in the Lord Chamberlain's Men alongside Shakespeare and Richard Burbage, but in a short time (possibly after a disagreement among the members of the troupe) he parted company with the group. Despite his fame as a performer and subsequent intent to continue his career, he appears to have died unregarded and in poverty circa 1603.\n\nIn a 1615 lawsuit brought by Thomasina (née Heminges) Ostler, widow of William Ostler, against her father, John Heminges, the recently deceased actor William Kempe was referred to as a gentleman (\"Willelmo Kempe nuper de Londonia generoso defuncto\"), and it has been suggested that he was a member of the Kempe family of Olantigh, a property north of Wye in Kent:\n\nKemp's parentage is unknown, though it has been conjectured that, despite his plebeian performance persona, he was linked in some way to the Kempes of Ollantighe, near Ashford in Kent, who were a wealthy Catholic dynasty. Sir Thomas Kempe (1517–1591) did indeed have a son named William; however, the claim that this William Kempe was the actor cannot be correct, since he was buried at Wye church on 27 March 1597 (Honneyman, 125–9; Bannerman, 3; private information, A. Findlay) . Nonetheless, this putative connection might help explain the otherwise surprising story—dramatized in the play The Travailes of the Three English Brothers (1607) by Day, Rowley, and Wilkins—that when William Kemp the actor was in Italy in 1601 he had an encounter with the celebrated traveller Sir Anthony Shirley: for Sir Anthony and his two equally famous brothers were related to the Ollantighe Kempes through their mother, who was Sir Thomas Kempe's daughter. Possibly, then, the actor had some tie of kinship to Ollantighe, at an outlying point on the family tree; or perhaps in recommending himself to Shirley he was just opportunistically taking advantage of the name he shared with Shirley's mother.\n\nKempe first enters the historical record as a performer with Leicester's Men at Leicester House in May 1585 and continued in this service after Leicester's departure for the Low Countries to take part in the Eighty Years' War. Leicester's nephew, Philip Sidney, sent letters home by way of a man he called \"Will, my Lord of Lester's jesting player\" and it is now generally accepted this was Kempe. Sidney complained in a letter to Francis Walsingham that \"Will\" had delivered the letters to Lady Leicester rather than Sidney's wife, Frances Walsingham. After a brief return to England, Kempe accompanied two other future Lord Chamberlain's Men, George Bryan and Thomas Pope, to Elsinore where he entertained Frederick II of Denmark.\n\nKempe's whereabouts in the later 1580s are not known, but that his fame as a performer was growing during this period is indicated by Thomas Nashe's \"An Almond for a Parrot\" (1590). Nashe dedicated this work to Kempe, calling him \"vicegerent general to the ghost of Dick Tarlton.\" Similarly, the title-page of the quarto of \"A Knack to Know a Knave\" advertises Kempe's \"merriments\". (Because title-pages were a means to draw attention to a book, the mention of Kempe suggests that he had become an attraction in his own right.) Critics have generally viewed the scene in which Kempe performs as rather flat (Collier, 97) and it is assumed that the scene provided a framework within which Kempe could improvise. Entries in the Stationers' Register indicate that three jigs (short comic plays) perhaps written by Kempe were published between 1591 and 1595. Two of these have survived.\n\nBy 1592 Kempe was one of Lord Strange's Men, listed in the Privy Council authorisation for that troupe to play seven miles out of London. In 1594, upon the dissolution of Strange's Men, Kempe, along with Burbage and Shakespeare, joined the Lord Chamberlain's Men and remained with that company until early 1599, when a still-unclear sequence of events removed him from the company. Although he had been a sharer in the plans to construct the Globe Theatre, he appeared in no productions in the new theatre, which was open by mid-1599, and evidence from Shakespeare's \"Henry V\", in which there is no promised continued role for Falstaff, and \"Hamlet\", containing its famous complaint at improvisational clowning (Act 3, Scene 2), indicates some of the circumstances in which Kempe may have been dropped. Kemp played his last role for Shakespeare in 1598.\n\nAfter his departure from the Chamberlain's Men in early 1599, Kempe continued to pursue his career as a performer. In February and March 1600, he undertook what he would later call his \"Nine Days Wonder\", in which he morris danced from London to Norwich (a distance of over a hundred miles) in a journey which took him nine days spread over several weeks, often amid cheering crowds. Later that year he published a description of the event to prove to doubters that it was true. However, his activities after this famous stunt are as obscure as his origins. On evidence from \"The Travels of the Three English Brothers\", he is assumed to have made another European tour, perhaps reaching Italy, but by 1601 he was borrowing money from Philip Henslowe and had joined Worcester's Men. The last undoubted mention of him occurs in Henslowe's diary in late 1602.\n\nParish records record the death of \"Kempe, a man\" in \"St. Saviour\", Southwark, late in 1603. While this is not necessarily the comedian, the record fits his departure from the documentary record.\n\nIn his time, Kempe was as famous for his stage jigs as for his acting in regular drama. The jig, a kind of rustic cousin to commedia dell'arte, featured as many as five performers in a partially improvised song-and-dance routine. Jigs had plots, often bawdy, but the emphasis was on dancing and physical comedy. Two of Kempe's jigs survive in English, and two more in German. Examples of the jigs may be seen in the manuscript collection of John Dowland (now in the Cambridge University Library). A famous 17th century jig called Kemp's Jig was named after Will Kempe and was published in the first book of John Playford's \"The English Dancing Master\" of 1651. The tune has received a number of modern renditions, including those by Jan Akkerman and Gryphon.\n\nAs an actor, Kempe is certainly associated with two roles: Dogberry in \"Much Ado About Nothing\" and Peter in \"Romeo and Juliet\". (In the quarto text of the latter, and in both quarto and First Folio text of the former, he is identified in speech prefixes and stage directions.) From these hints, a list of Kempe's parts has been deduced which, if conjectural, is not improbable: Costard in \"Love's Labours Lost\", Bottom in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", Lancelot Gobbo in \"The Merchant of Venice\", and Cob in Ben Jonson's \"Every Man in His Humour\". Falstaff is a more ambiguous case. Though Falstaff presents some features of an Elizabethan dramatic clown, his character is higher in class and more complex than the other roles with which Kempe is associated.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2008, comedian Tim FitzHigham re-enacted Kemp's Nine Day's Wonder by Morris dancing from London to Norwich, forming the basis of his play The Bard's Fool, performed at the Edinburgh Fringe.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "54561571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54561571", "title": "Women in Latin music", "text": "Women in Latin music\n\nWomen have made significant contributions to Latin music, a genre which predates Italian explorer Christopher Columbus' arrival in Latin America in 1492 and the Spanish colonization of the Americas. The earliest musicians were Native Americans, hundreds of ethnic groups across the continent, whose lyrics \"reflect conflict, beauty, pain, and loss that mark all human experience.\" Indigenous communities reserved music for women, who were given equal opportunities with men to teach, perform, sing, and dance. Ethnomusicologists have measured ceramic, animal-bone, and cane flutes from the Inca Empire which indicate a preference for women with a high vocal range. Women had equal social status, were trained, and received the same opportunities in music as men in indigenous communities until the arrival of Columbus in the late 15th century. European settlers brought patriarchal, machismo ideologies to the continent, replacing the idea of equality between men and women. They equated native music with \"savagery\" and European music with \"civilization\". Female musicians tended to be darker-skinned as a result of the slave trade (which increased the population of African slaves), and contemporary society denigrated music as a profession. Latin music became Africanized, with syncopated rhythms and call-and-response; European settlement introduced harmony and the Spanish décima song form.\n\nSince the pre-recording era of music, Latin music was male-dominated, and there are relatively few examples of female songwriters, music producers, record executives, and promoters. Women lacked access to musical training; music programs were nonexistent, and cultural norms discouraged female participation. Latin music had a primarily male presence; men discriminated against women, limiting them to singing or dancing and discouraging them from becoming instrumentalists, writers, composers, arrangers, and executives. Women artists in the sub-genres of Latin music, such as Selena, Jenni Rivera, Jennifer Lopez, Ivy Queen, Julieta Venegas, and Ely Guerra. have been credited with enhancing the genres' female presence; they have broken through barriers, reshaping Latin music and public perceptions of female sexuality, gender, and femininity. Women in salsa music are significantly underrepresented in the industry as very few women, with the exception of Celia Cruz, have been associated with the emergence of the genre; for example, in the British documentary \"Salsa: Latin Pop Music in the Cites\" (1985), Cruz is one of the only female singers who is mentioned.\n\nWomen Latin singers have a significant demographic imbalance on \"Billboard\" music charts compared with their male counterparts. As radio formats explore genres popularized and led by men, such as reggaeton and regional Mexican music, women on the \"Billboard\" Latin music charts are periodically absent. The last female singer with a number-one single was Sofia Reyes, whose collaborative \"Solo Yo\" ended a five-year drought on the Latin Pop Songs chart in 2016. A year earlier, on the 50-position Hot Latin Songs chart, 22 weeks passed without a song by a women. Reyes has expressed concern about the disparity between male and female performances at Latin music award shows, noting that 90 percent of the performers are male. Other female singers, such as Chiquis Rivera, have attributed the decline in visibility of women in Latin music to sexist radio programmers. Latin music executive Alexandra Lioutikoff believes that the decline is due to a lack of female collaboration. Latin music remains male-dominated, and the music industry has \"prejudiced practice\" limiting female recording artists.\n\nLatin American music is varied; it includes thirty countries, influenced by European, African, and Amerindian cultures. Latin music uses two European languages: Spanish and Portuguese, though modern-day widely distinguishes the genre as primarily sung or recorded in Spanish and to a lesser extent French and Italian. Although heterogeneous, Latin music commonly includes the Spanish décima song form, African syncopated rhythms and call-and-response, and European harmony.\n\nPre-modern Latin music refers to music made by Native Americans, hundreds of ethnic groups across the continent. The first inhabitants of Latin America settled 30,000 years before the arrival of Italian explorer Christopher Columbus at the peak of native cultural diversification into simple and complex societies. These societies included sedentary agricultural tribes and hunter gatherers, who sang prayers to a deity asking for prosperity with lyrics of \"conflict, beauty, pain, and loss that mark all human experience\" and music reflecting their understanding of the universe. They had \"intricate ways of explaining the relationships between the sound, social organization, time, and the sacred\", and their rituals included dramatized performances of mythology vocalizing their view of creation. The creation myth of the Keres people of Laguna Pueblo (present west-central New Mexico) describes \"the unformed cosmos as the domain of Tse che nako (Thought Woman or Spider Woman) who chants life into two sacred bundles that become the sisters Uretsete and Naosete (She Who Matters and She Who Remembers).\"\n\nIndigenous communities predating Columbus' arrival reserved music for women, although men were equally involved in dance. During the Inca Empire in the mid-14th century, women from royal families and selected \"acallas\" (chosen ones) were taught science, art, poetry, and music from \"wise elders\". The \"chosen ones\" were selected for their beauty and \"quality of their voices.\" There were six houses, one of which was called the \"taquiaclla\" (\"taqui\" means \"song\"), which housed girls aged nine to fifteen with \"gifted\" singing voices. The Andeans preferred young women with a high vocal range. Although no scripts or musical notation survive, archaeologists have uncovered a variety of ceramic, animal bone, and cane flutes. Ethnomusicologists who have measured the flutes have found their pitch compatible with a high vocal range. Women in these communities were well-treated, with equal opportunities to teach, perform, sing, and dance (as soloists, with other women, or in pairs with men). Female singers had a social status equal to men, receiving musical training and opportunities with their male counterparts.\n\nColumbus' arrival in 1492 and the Spanish colonization of the Americas brought patriarchy and machismo to the continent, overriding sexual equality. Early Spanish music described women as \"property and mistrusted [by men].\" In a song, \"Delgadina\", women are servants who must please their men \"no matter the cost.\" According to author Janet Sturman, the Iberian idea of machismo (in which a strong man is superior to others, including women) was held by the conquistadors. Europeans who settled in the New World associated native music with \"savagery\" and European music with \"civilization\". During the slave trade, musicians in Latin America primarily had a dark complexion. This was due to an increased population of African slaves and contemporary society's view of music as a profession. Most slaves arriving in Brazil were \"bi-musical\", and introduced their music to the country. Rural Quechua-speaking Bolivian farmers sang about European resistance in songs with Native American and European influences. Black Bolivians sang songs with lyrics reflecting a European influence, performed as Africanized European music.\n\nIn colonial Latin America, nuns wrote, directed, and performed music. They played a variety of instruments, including the clavichord, harp, flageolet, and flute. The nuns played in front of spectators, choirs, and high-ranking government officials. Musically-adept, underprivileged women were allowed to perform during the nuns' Christmas recital. Performances were often \"feminine acts\", such as sewing, embroidery, bakery, and selling \"special confections.\" For two hundred years in Latin America, the \"elite woman\" was educated in the arts; \"the rest\" were consigned to cooking, sewing, spinning, weaving, embroidery, and music. In 17th- and 18th-century Mexico City, music was often heard by visitors. The music emanated from cathedral choirs, indigenous dancers, or black musicians organized in the city. During the 17th century, Europeans and their descendants wrote and performed music at cathedrals in Mexico's cities which was repeated in song by blacks, mulattos, indigenous Mexicans, Asians, and ethnicities. In 1690, Mexican author Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz wrote secular and religious poetry, plays, philosophy, and theology. She often discussed topics ranging from mathematics to music with visitors, had no interest in marriage and wanted to pursue \"a life of the mind.\" Although her views were suppressed, de la Cruz defended women's rights in education.\n\nAt a 1691 celebration, European traveler Juan de Galde described his participation in dancing and singing and placing a scapular on two young women in Mexico. A Mexican singer named Reina performed for six hours, which made \"the event more enjoyable\". The \"wild\" celebration banned Jamaicans from entry. In 1697, Neapolitan chronicler Gemelli Carreri wrote during his trip off the coast of the Dominican Republic that he saw a canoe of musicians trying to outdo each other in singing and drawing attention to their \"perfection\". In 1799 Buenos Aires, privileged women were encouraged to educate themselves in the arts. The government required that women be taught to read and write, in addition to physical education and music.\n\nSince the arrival of European settlers, Latin music has been male-dominated. Musical training was nonexistent for women. Male predominance in the genre left \"power imbalances that acted as barriers to women's participation in Latin music.\" Despite this barrier, women have become successful. Under the authority of men, they were limited to roles as vocalists or dancers rather than instrumentalists, writers, composers, arrangers, and executives. According to musicologist Ilan Stavans, female roles were related to traditional norms; \"decent women\" cared for their children and remained at home, cleaning and cooking. Women's dance routines were a growing concern among female fans and performers. Female dancers, more closely scrutinized than males, were expected to follow \"normative gender expectations\" and exhibit \"appropriate behavior\". Although male dancers typically performed suggestively, women who danced similarly were accused of being \"loose\" or \"slack\".\n\nAccording to author Lise Waxer, Cuban trova singer María Teresa Vera is the \"great-grandmother of all Latin women singers\". \"Arroz Con Leche\" (\"Rice Pudding\"), which advises the listener to find a spouse who will take care of them, was criticized by feminist groups. Bolero lyrics have a central theme of women as the object of male desire, unrequited love, and abandonment, portraying women as \"physical absence and emotional distance, as ungrateful beings\" unequipped to love a man. Cuban singer La Lupe \"pushed the boundaries\" of bolero music, and was called the queen of Latin soul music. She toured the U.S. with bandleader Tito Puente, and was one of the most popular Latin performers of the 1960s. In her youth she dominated local singing competitions, which inspired her to pursue a career in music despite her parents' desire for her to become a teacher. After divorcing her first husband, La Lupe began a solo career and performed in Havana nightclubs. Her popularity grew, and she owned and operated a nightclub in Cuba which was seized by the Castro government. La Lupe emigrated to the United States, settled in New York in 1962 and began touring the country with other bolero and salsa performers. She released several salsa albums with \"devotional lyrics.\" Her concert requests began diminishing at the turn of the 1970s as her savings drained because of her second husband's failing health. She ended her professional career in a wheelchair at a final, 1985 concert with Puente to help pay her medical expenses. La Lupe, who devoted her remaining years to Christian music in the Bronx, died of cardiac arrest in February 1992. Cuban singers Rita Montaner and Celeste Mendoza were involved in the \"appropriation and rearticulation of rumba\", a genre popular before salsa.\nAs salsa music grew in popularity, Celia Cruz emerged during the 1950s and was known as the queen of the genre. Although Cruz was instrumental in popularizing and developing male-dominated salsa, few other women are associated with it. She was the only female singer featured in the British documentary, \"Salsa: Latin Pop Music in the Cities\" (1985), which noted the absence of women in the industry. According to the documentary, women were \"not trained in popular music and that women dared not improvise—\"sonear\" (closeness)—on stage\". Cruz crossed boundaries set by public expectations for music performed at nightclubs, but she was the exception who proved the rule. Opportunities for all-female salsa bands were nonexistent; gender discrimination flourished in the market, and women were seen as \"less competent than their male counterparts.\" In 1977 Cruz recorded \"Usted Abusó\", which gave a voice to battered women. The 1980s saw the emergence of salsa romántica, which was \"deemed as homogenized, depoliticized, and ultimately, feminized.\"\n\nDuring the 1990s women began playing a larger role in salsa music, increasing the genre's popularity, and female salsa singers broke \"the sexist boundaries of the [Latin] music industry\". Although women singers were becoming more popular, images of men were emphasized to the public more than those of women. La India, Corinne, Brenda K. Starr, Lissette Melendez, and Yolanda la Duke were instrumental in refining salsa in that decade, although all were managed by men. Their new salsa sound was influenced by African American music (hip-hop, R&B, gospel, jazz, and soul), which revolutionized traditional 1970s salsa. According to author Lise Waxer, a \"careful and attentive listening\" of their recordings indicated the \"female authority and influence—a female genealogy—of salsa music.\" Salsa's leading female singer was La India, who developed salsa romantica music during the 1990s and whose lyrics \"turn the tables\" on the male salsa narrative of women as objects of desire, \"cruel and evil or idealized and unattainable.\" In her most-popular song, \"Ese Hombre\" (originally recorded by Rocío Jurado), La India contradicts male stereotypes. The song's lyrics describe a man who is \"a fool/stupid and conceited/selfish and capricious\", reversing male \"discursive terrorism\" toward their female partners. La India has been compared to Celia Cruz as leaders in their respective eras, and to La Lupe in musical style: \"nasal style of singing, growls, and screams that evoke an androgynous style rather than a soft melodious tone.\"\n\nIn her Spanish-language debut, Gloria Estefan released \"Mi Tierra\" (1993). It was a commercial success, debuting atop the new US \"Billboard\" Top Latin Albums chart. Estefan has been described by her Latin pop contemporaries as performing pop ballads and soft rock. She has also ventured into salsa and merengue music, using salsa in her English-language compositions; \"Conga\" brought her to European clubs. The rural Cuban genre guajira offered a musical identity to Afro-Cubans; Albita Rodriguez became popular, and was named one of the top 100 personalities of the 20th century by \"Newsweek\" magazine. Most of her repertoire are love songs with \"openly erotic lyrics\" with hetero- and homosexual themes.\n\nThe duo of Monchy y Alexandra \"established bachata as a 'nice' music that could be listened to in the home by women and children.\" Women \"embraced [the] clean-up\"; the romantic bachata style, with emotive lyrics, expressed longing for a lost lover. In 1950s bachata music, women were accused of \"treachery or promiscuity or, in more humorous moments, referring to their sexuality and sexual organs with thinly veiled double entendres.\" The lyrics were rooted in an era where women in the workplace became more common, displacing men as breadwinners.\n\nIn 19th-century merengue music, a man \"won the love of woman\" by dancing. Modern merengue (a party genre) lyrics explored the \"vicissitudes of urban life [and] employed skillful wordplay and humorous double entendres about women and sex.\" Because of the genre's \"air of male-dominated sexuality\", Dominican men believed that making merengue music is \"no fitting occupation for women.\" According to Santo Domingans, listening to merengue music \"is only for men\" and a woman who enjoys the music is considered \"a crazy girl [and] a bad girl.\" During the 1970s, attitudes toward women and merengue music changed with the changing roles of women in Dominican society. All-female merengue bands emerged in the 1980s, beginning with Las Chicas Del Can in 1984. Participation in merengue increased in 1990, with women playing percussion and brass instruments formerly considered too difficult for women.\n\nFemale merengue bands were often formed by successful male merengue musicians, who \"often referred to them as the property of the [male musicians who formed them].\" The mainly-female merengue band Milly, Jocelyn y Los Vecinos formed after Las Chicas del Can. The group became popular, despite not setting out to challenge existing gender roles. Feminists have noted the \"limited values\" in merengue recordings by women, since most of their songs are written by men who \"do not resolutely challenge patriarchal attitudes.\" Olga Tañón was the most successful female merengue artist in the 1990s, and has been called the queen of merengue music. Tañón has been credited with popularizing merengue in Puerto Rico, a salsa-dominated market. Her 1994 album, \"Siente el Amor\", outsold her previous recordings: \"Mujer de Fuego\" (1993) and her platinum-certified debut studio album, \"Sola\" (1992).\n\nSince the beginning of radio women have been accepted as mariachi singers, often performing duets with men. The Mexican quintet Las Coronelas, formed by María Carlota Noriega during the 1940s, was the first mariachi all-female band. The first all-female ranchera band, Las Generales (formed by Elena Muñoz), consisted of wives and mothers of male professional mariachi musicians. The group was criticized by the public for playing in \"cantinas\" (bars), and their partners destroyed their instruments. Other all-female bands tried unsuccessfully to be pioneers. Four of the six-member Mariachi Estrella de Topeka and 110 others were killed in the 1981 Hyatt Regency walkway collapse. Rebecca Gonzales, who later joined the Los Angeles Uclatlan band, was the first female mariachi violinist. According to Gonzales, the other members of Uclatlan found it \"bizarre\" that a woman was playing with them and it took the group about a month to accept her. Gonzales was the first female mariachi musician to break through professionally. A role model for female mariachi hopefuls, she was inducted into the Mariachi Hall of Fame in Tucson, Arizona in 2004. Eva Ybarra mastered the accordion at a young age and began performing with her parents during the 1940s. The 1962 film \"El Mariachi Canta\" pokes fun at the rarity of female mariachi singers, with men cross-dressing as women.\n\nLinda Ronstadt debuted on the Latin-music scene with \"Canciones de Mi Padre\" (1987), credited with inspiring a mariachi renaissance in the United States. Other moderately-successful mariachi singers are educator and Mariachi Hall of Famer Laura Sobrino, Cindy Reifer, Marisa Orduno, trumpeter Cindy Shea, Patricia Martin, and Judith Kamel. In corrido, a ballad form consisting of four-line verses, women played supporting roles as mothers, wives \"or represented the subject of the protagonist's affections.\" Female soldiers in the Mexican Revolution were styled as \"corridistas\". Women were discouraged from playing and singing Tejano music due to Tejano patriarchy. Only a handful of female Tejano singers, including Chavela Ortiz, Lisa Lopez, Patsy Torres, Laura Canales, and Elsa Garcia, were successful in the genre before it became popular. Other female singers who were moderately successful during the Tejano golden age were Shelly Lares, Stefani Montiel, Mary Lee Ochoa, and Stephanie Lynn. \n\nAt the turn of the decade, Tejano music was the fastest-growing music genre in the United States. The American singer Selena dominated Tejano music, bringing it mainstream success. During her early career, she was often turned down by music venues because of her age and her fronting of a Tejano band. Selena's father, Abraham Quintanilla, Jr. was told that she would not be successful because she was a woman. She was the first female Tejano singer to receive gold and platinum certifications, the first female Tejano singer to receive a Grammy Award for Best Mexican American Album, the first Tejano singer to top the US \"Billboard\" Top Latin Albums chart, and the first female to outsell male Tejano singers. After Selena's 1995 murder, Tejano music waned in popularity. Selena's popularity increased after her death, and she is the only Tejano singer with constant appearances on the US \"Billboard\" 200. Her posthumously-released album, \"Dreaming of You\" (1995), was the first recording by a Hispanic singer to debut atop the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. Selena's music explored love, pain, strength and passion, and \"Billboard\" called her the best-selling Latin artist of the 1990s. Latin music entered the mainstream market in the late 1990s, believed by music critics to be due to the death of Selena and the emergence of Ricky Martin, Christina Aguilera, Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony, with greater commercial success and worldwide recognition than ever before.\n\nAs Tejano music declined in popularity, norteño music was pioneered by Lydia Mendoza and Alicia Villareal. Although Ilan Stavans found it challenging to describe Mexican singer Jenni Rivera as a feminist, he found that her recordings sparked debate in the Latino community about women's roles. Debuting on the music scene in 1994, Rivera's music \"addresses the lives of men and women of humble backgrounds\". She was commercially successful as a vocalist in the regional Mexican music scene and its subgenres, banda, conjunto (small band) and Tejano, before her 2012 death in a plane crash. Mexican singer Lila Downs debuted on the Latin-music scene with her album, \"Ofrenda\", in 1994. Downs, a prolific innovator, popularized Latin folk music in recordings blending folk instrumentals with Oaxaca references.\n\nAna Bárbara is the leading female in grupera, a regional Mexican folk genre, and Jennifer Peña was called \"one of Latin music's most promising female singers\" by \"Billboard\" magazine. The mid-2000s decline of women in regional Mexican music slowed, with greater representation by Graciela Beltran, Yolanda Perez, Los Horóscopos de Durango, Diana Reyes, and Jenni Rivera.\n\nAs hip-hop and rap became popular in the United States during the 1990s, Latin singers began emulating them. Men dominated the Latin urban scene; women were objectified, seen as accessories indicating male status. Unlike the hip-hop and rap music scenes, their Latin equivalents did not formulate a female role model; female Latina urban singers failed to attain commercial success. During the popularity of Latin freestyle (also called freestyle music or Latin hip-hop) in the 1980s, record companies began signing \"attractive young women with little musical talent using the same production style for all of them, weakening rather than strengthening the style.\" Many Hispanic freestyle singers tried to downplay their Latino identity after radio programmers discriminated against records by Hispanic performers. Lisa Velez changed her name to Lisa Lisa, and became one of the first commercially successful freestyle musicians. Latin hip-hop singer Roja (one half of Rima Roja en Venus) expressed the difficulty of performing (in a male-dominated genre) a song which \"insults based on having sex with the opponent's mother, sister, aunt; or calling each other by the names of women's sexual organs. It was bizarre: they were managing to totally objectify women, and at the same time make us invisible.\" According to Roja, in her early career as a rap freestyler men tried to \"shut [her] up\". Other female hip-hop singers, such as Argentinian MC Rebeca Lane and Ecuadorian Audry Funk, concur. Argentinian Actitud María Marta, a hip-hop group formed in prison, has been called a pioneer and has inspired other female hip-hop singers. \nReggaeton dancers (to music exemplifying sexual desire) have received a negative public reception of their sexually-suggestive routines, with most public outcry about this type of dance focusing on female morality. Reggaeton singer Ivy Queen addressed concerns in her 2003 single, \"Yo Quiero Bailar\", which confronts sexual accessibility; dancing suggestively with a man does not necessarily mean that she wants to sleep with him. Recording Reggaeton Women called Ivy Queen \"the spokeswoman for females in reggaeton\" after her 2005 debut album, and she remains the only woman visible in the genre. Reggaeton has been criticized for the roles women play. Recordings often reflect lyrics and dance routines suggesting doggy style sex, exemplifying machismo behavior and hypermasculinity. Most reggaeton songs \"[circumscribe women] to dancing and fulfilling male sexual desire\", which \"eliminates almost all possibility of action and translates their presence into a prize or trophy that men exhibit, dominate, and manipulate.\" In Ivy Queen's song, \"Chika Ideal\", the singer introduces her female friend to \"the dance floor to satisfy her man's fantasies and answer (with her body) each time he wants to call her.\" In reggaeton music videos, women often act out or \"beg for sexual action\" from male musicians. In Residente's music video for \"Chulin Culin Chunfly\", women wore costumes and played police officers, bartenders, and servers. Before reggaeton became popular, Cuban singer Pedro Calvo invited preteens and middle-aged women onstage and began to \"[go] down on them\". Sexuality among young women in Cuba has been viewed as \"normative learning behavior\" descended from the Afro-Cuban Palo religion, where men and women dance closely before \"the man goes behind the women in a picaresque way\" and emulates a \"gesture of appreciation\". Cover images of reggaeton records often feature women who are \"voluptuous, provocative, and scantily clad.\"\n\nSelena's music influenced Jennifer Lopez, who played the singer in her 1997 biographical film and debuted in the Latin music market with salsa singer Marc Anthony on the 1999 single \"No Me Ames\". Lopez remained in the American pop market through the early 2000s and returned to Latin music with her Spanish-language debut, \"Como Ama Una Mujer\", in 2006. The album was a commercial success, debuting in the top ten of the \"Billboard\" 200 and joining the handful of Hispanic artists with an album in the chart's top ten. Mexican actress and singer Thalía debuted on the Latin music scene during the early 1990s. In mid-decade the singer became commercially successful, with her album \"En Éxtasis\" (1995) certified platinum. She contributed to three tracks for the 1997 soundtrack of Fox Animation Studios' \"Anastasia\". Thalía's lyrics explore \"women or men in a narcissistic, neoliberal, first-world context but do not make sense in the general context of Latin American ordinary life\" attributed to other female performers, such as the Mexican singer Paulina Rubio and the Spanish singer Belinda. Thalía and Rubio have been called \"young, blonde, and thin\", wearing \"fashionable\" clothing, whose \"dull\" lyrics assume the role of a \"seductive, sexy, young woman who wants a macho-man at heart.\" According to musicologists Jacqueline Eyring Bixler and Laurietz Seda, Thalía and Rubio's music does not address \"mature and/or working-class women\".\nShakira's major-label debut, \"Pies Descalzos\" (1995), was the singer's \"breakthrough album\" in the Latin-music market and yielded the hit single \"Estoy Aquí\". She had a Latin pop rock sound, influenced by Middle Eastern and Latin American music. Shakira continued her career with the Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock Album-nominated \"Dónde Están los Ladrones?\" (1998), and joined Gloria Estefan and her husband, Emilio, to produce her first English-language album; it yielded \"Suerte\", which brought her mainstream success. Formed in 2006 in Argentina, the Kumbia Queers have recorded cumbia and Latin pop tracks with \"ironic and witty articulations of desire\".\n\nIn Spain, Lola Flores is hailed as the queen of flamenco music and Rocío Jurado is considered \"one of the purest voices of all time\" in the country. Music executive Lynn Santiago, who represented Yolandita Monge, Lissette Melendez, and Vikki Carr during the 1980s, said in a \"Billboard\" interview that she wanted \"to represent only a few artists in order to give them individual attention.\" Latin pop musicians from Puerto Rico, such as Lucecita Benítez and Monge, had male promoters who wanted to \"bring local performers\" by \"offering a big fiesta for the people [of Puerto Rico].\" Other Latin pop musicians popular in Puerto Rico during the 1980s include Conchita Alonso, Maggy, Lunna \"Cheo\" Feliciano, Sophy Hernandez, and the Argentine duo Pimpinela. In mainstream pop, female musicians Mariah Carey, Debelah Morgan, Jessica Simpson, Celine Dion, Carole King, Tina Arena, Gloria Gaynor, Alexia, Jennifer Rush, Lara Fabian, Madonna, Laura Pausini, Beyoncé, Selena Gomez, Demi Lovato, Azealia Banks, Ariana Grande, and Toni Braxton often record Spanish-language versions of their songs.\n\nAfter winning the inaugural Festival of Latin Song in Puerto Rico in 1969, Lucecita Benítez \"single-handedly put Puerto Rico on the map.\" Her winning song, \"Génesis\", expressed \"extreme male melancholy\"; author Licia Fiol-Matta called Benitez a \"masculine female\" whose delivery \"unexpectedly delivered this affect home.\" Throughout her career, Benítez performed and recorded compositions atypical of Puerto Rican music; nonconforming to gender roles, they did not address heterosexual desire. She survived several silencing attempts by those who disliked her music. Women remain a minority in Puerto Rican music, although singers Myrta Silva, Ruth Fernandez, Ernestina Reyes, and La Calandria have achieved moderate success.\n\nThe 1989 single \"Virginidad Sacudida\" by Mexican hardcore punk band Secta Suicida Siglo explores sexual repression among women, challenged heterosexism in Latin music, and opposed refraining from premarital sex for fear of being called a prostitute. Colombian singer Andrea Echeverri's music \"underlines the hybrid nature of Latin American culture\"; called the most-important female rock en español interpreter, she \"incorporates [her music with] the past rather than refusing it or mocking it.\" Echeverri is the lead singer of Aterciopelados, the only female-led rock en español band. She pursues a feminist agenda with her music, which has made her popular in the \"most revolutionary and controversial musical genres in Latin America.\" The singer grew up encouraged by her mother to sing boleros, ballads, and rancheras. She decided to continue her education in the arts, returning to music during the 1980s. Echeverri joined Delia y Los Aminoácidos in the 1990s; influenced by punk and hardcore music, the band's name was later changed to the Aterciopelados. Because of Echeverri's interest the band's repertoire focused on women's issues, with lyrics about women's relationships with men, and performed songs exploring domestic abuse, denouncing misogyny and \"overdramatized passionate love\", and examining Latin America's ideology and history of traditional love. As her popularity grew, Echeverri became a feminist icon and released an underground recording: \"Con el Corazón en la Mano\" (1993). The album, intended as a demo, reached the top ten in Colombia and piqued the interest of BMG Music Group and MTV. The band followed with \"El Dorado\" (1995) and went to London to produce \"La Pipa de la Paz\" (1996), which was certified gold in Colombia and received Aterciopelados' first nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Latin Alternative Music Album.\nAlthough some female Latin singers have explored a range of feminist topics, including sexism, domestic abuse, and \"reclaiming women's sexuality through their music\", others (such as Julieta Venegas) have refrained from labeling themselves as feminists. Venegas said in a 2004 interview that her music has a \"feminine point of view\" and does not delve into feminism. Chilean folklorist Violeta Parra recorded songs about failed heterosexual relationships, emphasizing men's incapability to commit to a woman. Called the \"bad girl\" of Latin pop and the queen of Latin American rock music, Alejandra Guzmán has attained \"tabloid notoriety for her flesh-baring displays on stage and for a series of controversial moves and wrong turns in her personal life\" but has been credited with breaking barriers in Latin music for women. Her parents, Enrique Guzmán and Silvia Pinal, often recorded and performed music together and were considered the Mexican Sonny and Cher.\n\nIn Portuguese music, Amália Rodrigues is considered the \"best-known and most famous\" \"fadista\" by author Paul Buck; Rodrigues' lyrics were written by \"the most celebrated poets and writers of the day.\" The singer was instrumental in popularizing fado, \"attract[ing] attention around the world.\" Ana Moura has emerged in modern fado with \"transcendent singing [which] personifies [fado music]\" and lyrics reflecting \"lost love, separation, and longing.\" Fado, a traditional folk genre popular in Lisbon, was once a male enclave. Female singers such as Mariza, Mísia, Mafalda Arnauth, Dulce Pontes, Cristina Branco, Joana Amendoeira, Raquel Tavares, Yolanda Soares and Kátia Guerreiro have reinvigorated modern fado. In Portuguese folk, Teresa Salgueiro's \"rich and enchanting\" vocals have been praised. Other Portuguese female singers (Felipa Pais, Marta Dias, Sofia Varela, Anabella, Bevinda, Sara Tavares, Cesaria Evora, Maria João, Marisa Monte, and Lura) have attained moderate success in the country. Cristina Pato, Xiradela, Leilia, Ialma, and Donicelas \"represent the rediscovery of the importance of female singers in Galician traditional music.\" Ugia Pedreira, the Galician lead singer of Marful, \"mixes traditional Galician song with new jazz arrangements [and] harmonies.\"\n\nDaniela Mercury is one of the \"best-known Brazilian female singers\". During the 1950s, some female singers in Brazil were called prostitutes and risked being labeled \"promiscuous or masculine ... [or] lesbians\". According to authors Oliver Marshall, Dilwyn Jenkins and David Cleary, the country has \"a strong tradition of producing excellent female singers\". They list Elis Regina, Gal Costa, Marisa Monte, Silvia Torres, Belô Velloso, and Fernanda Porto as examples of the sizable roster of women in Brazilian music.\n\nAlthough women have been credited with reshaping Latin music and public perceptions of sexuality, gender, and feminism, the Latin music industry remains male-dominated. American musicologist Ilan Stavans credits Selena, Jenni Rivera, Jennifer Lopez, Ivy Queen, Julieta Venegas, and Ely Guerra for the visibility of women in Latin music. NPR named Maluca, Bomba Estereo, La Lupe, Gloria Trevi, Chavela Vargas, Tita Merello, as \"\"las mostras\", fierce women of Latin music.\" \"Billboard\" magazine named Selena as a \"role model to Latinas everywhere\", and \"Latina\" magazine named Gloria Estefan as \"a role model for women across the globe.\" According to \"Latina\", singers Rita Moreno, Selena, Gloria Estefan, Celia Cruz, Shakira, and Jennifer Lopez \"changed the world\" with their work, achieved \"more and [gave] more.\" With Selena, Jenni Rivera has been credited with the visibility of women in regional Mexican music with the \"very large population of Mexican American women in the United States [with whom they] could identify\". In Tejano music, Selena's popularity has helped \"open the doors\" to other female singers. Because of the singer's influence, women in Tejano music emerged \"as a significant [demographic]\" in the genre during the 1990s and major record labels began increasing their female representation. After Selena, women were \"a significant part of [the Tejano and regional Mexican music] industry.\" Her \"Dreaming of You\" (1995) album topped the \"Billboard\" 200 chart, the first Hispanic artist and the first woman to do so. At the turn of the 21st century, Thalía, Paulina Rubio, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira, and Pilar Montenegro were the most popular female Latin pop singers. Graciela Beltran, Jennifer Pena, Ana Gabriel, and Paquita la del Barrio were the most popular female singers in their respective regional-Mexican genres, but female singers remain \"rare\" in regional Mexican music. \"People en Espanol\" named singers Lucero, Chiquis Rivera, and Jennifer Lopez in its 2017 list of the top 25 most-powerful Latina women. \"Billboard\" released a list of the top 100 music executives, which included Maria Fernandez (senior vice president operations and CFO of Latin Iberia-Sony Music Entertainment) and Rocio Guerrero (global head of Latin content programming for Spotify).\n\nAlthough women in mariachi music are perceived to be widely accepted, contemporary female singers in the genre have found it an \"unwelcoming environment for females.\" According to the Duranguense group Los Horóscopos de Durango, in 21st-century regional Mexican music it is \"hard for women to actually be respected, to be taken into consideration, to be given the time to show [their] talent.\" The group has found the genre a \"struggle\" because of male dominance. In 2017, Univision broadcast the reality television competition show \"La Reina de la Canción\" (\"Queen of Song\"), in which participants with \"the best voices, compelling stories, and a desire to become a superstar\" compete to become the next star of regional Mexican music. \"Billboard\" executive director of Latin content and programming Leila Cobo wrote that the public perception of regional Mexican music is a group of men dressed as cowboys. In the 2004 and 2005 year-end charts, only one female in the genre reached the top twenty; in 2006, there were three. That year, three singles by women topped the Hot Latin Songs chart: Shakira's collaborative single with Wyclef Jean, \"Hips Don't Lie\"; Paulina Rubio's \"Ni Una Sola Palabra\", and Anais' \"Lo Que Son Las Cosas\". In 2008, there were no number-one singles by a woman on the Latin music charts. Early in 2009 Jennifer Lopez ended the drought with \"Qué Hiciste\" (number one for a week), followed by Gloria Estefan's \"No Llores\" and Fanny Lu's \"Y Si Te Digo\". In August 2009 three women (Shakira, Paulina Rubio, and Nelly Furtado) made the top ten of the Hot Latin Songs chart, a \"rare occurrence\". According to industry observers, women on the charts are \"cyclical, as every couple of years a burst of estrogen appears on the typically testosterone-dominated Latin charts.\"\nWomen finalists at the 2016 \"Billboard\" Latin Music Awards were outnumbered by men, which was described by the magazine as a \"continuing [challenge] facing female artists in Latin music.\" For 2017 International Women's Day and Women's History Month, the music streaming service Spotify curated a playlist of women in Latin music. The playlist included music from Selena, Celia Cruz, and Natalia Lafourcade. An April 2016 \"Billboard\" report noted the absence of women from the magazine's music charts. The report found that the last female soloist topped the US Hot Latin Songs chart four years earlier: Shakira, with Maná (a male rock en español group), singing \"Mi Verdad\". In 2012 seven women had number-ones on the Top Latin Albums chart, compared with 33 men. \"Billboard\" executive Leila Cobo found that three of the seven women were veterans (Gloria Trevi, Thalía, and Ednita Nazario), and another three were deceased (Selena, Jenni Rivera, and Natalie Cole. Leslie Grace was the youngest female singer to reach number one on the Latin Airplay chart when she was 17 years old, and Alexandra Lioutikoff was the first woman executive vice-president at Universal Music Publishing Group's Latin division. Asked why the visibility of women in Latin music has declined, Chiquis Rivera suggested that radio programmers are to blame for their \"\"machista\" culture.\" According to Lioutikoff, women (unlike their male counterparts) \"rarely collaborate\". In its report, \"Billboard\" compiled a list of the top five women with the most number-ones on the Hot Latin Songs; Gloria Estefan led the list with 15, Shakira had 10, Selena seven, Ana Gabriel six, and Paulina Rubio five. The magazine found women \"underrepresented on the Latin-music-focused \"Billboard\" charts\", with Rubio the last female number-one with \"Me Gustas Todo\" on February 11, 2012. A discrepancy existed between the Top Latin Albums and the \"Billboard\" 200 charts; seven women topped the Latin Albums chart, compared to 21 on the \"Billboard\" 200.\n\nWomen remain a minority in Puerto Rican music. According to Licia Fiol-Matta, the music industry has a \"prejudiced practice of limiting the number of women recording artists\" and women singers \"did not sell records since women did not buy records.\" In July 2017, Alejandra Guzmán and Gloria Trevi were the first female collaboration in the 24-year history of the Top Latin Albums chart to debut atop the chart. In 2016, Mexican pop singer Sofia Reyes was the first female lead singer with a number-one single in five years. Her collaboration with Prince Royce on \"Solo Yo\" was the first number-one single on the Latin Pop Songs chart by a woman since Jennifer Lopez' \"Ven A Bailar\" (2011) with Pitbull. Eight women have topped the Latin Pop Songs chart as featured acts, duos or groups with female leads: \"Solo Yo\" (Sofia Reyes with Prince Royce, April 23, 2016); \"Mi Verdad\" (Maná, featuring Shakira, April 4, 2015); \"Corre!\" (Jesse & Joy, March 31, 2012); \"Dutty Love\" (Don Omar with Natti Natasha, March 24, 2012), \"Fuiste Tu\" (Ricardo Arjona with Gaby Moreno, March 10, 2012); \"Give Me Everything\" (Pitbull with Ne-Yo, Afrojack and Nayer, July 23, 2011), and \"Ven A Bailar\" (Jennifer Lopez with Pitbull, June 18, 2011). Amaya Mendizabal of \"Billboard\" called the decline of women on the Latin music charts \"an ongoing trend.\" In 2015, 22 weeks passed without a female-led single on the 50-position Hot Latin Songs chart. According to Mendizabal, the absence of women on the Latin music charts is \"partly attributed to the steady popularity of reggaeton and regional Mexican music, which is often led by male acts.\" Mendizabal wrote that \"traditional pop songs\" rarely top the Hot Latin Songs chart; four pop songs did so in the previous three years, most by men. Sofia Reyes has expressed concern about the lack of women performers at Latin-music awards shows, telling Jeff Benjamin of Fuse TV that 90 percent of awards-show performers are men.\n\nIn July 2017, Spanish writer Daniela Bose noted the absence of women in Spanish music charts in comparison with those of France and Italy; culturally similar to Spain, women were more successful in the latter countries. Bose analyzed the Spanish Albums and Singles Charts, finding that the only Spanish singers who placed in the top 50 were Malú, Vanesa Martin, Sweet California, India Martinez, and the Spanish folk music singers Mónica Naranjo and Isabel Pantoja. When Bose expanded her search to the next 50 positions, she found only non-Spanish singers. She concluded that listeners had replaced Spanish and Latin pop music with reggaeton and trap music, genres performed by men with lyrics belittling women \"as meat\". Bose found a subtext in the songs encouraging female infidelity for sexual reasons, alluding to a non-committed relationship. According to Bose, music \"is not one of those 'secure' professions [for those who] seek stability\"; she found women absent from prominent positions held by men, such as heading a record label, producing concerts, and audio engineering; in these fields, with higher pay and power, women lack \"decision-making process[es] that set the path for [the Latin music] industry.\" She ended her report by urging the music industry to avoid gender imbalances in their markets: \"What dazzles is the beauty of the final work, regardless of who creates it.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29803015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29803015", "title": "Woodwrae Stone", "text": "Woodwrae Stone\n\nThe Woodwrae Stone (alternatively the Woodwray Stone) is a Class II Pictish Stone (c. 8th or 9th century) that was found in 1819 when the foundations of the old castle at Woodwrae, Angus, Scotland were cleared. It had been reused as a floor slab in the kitchen of the castle. Following its removal from the castle, it was donated to the collection of Sir Walter Scott at Abbotsford House. It is now on display at the Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.\n\nWoodwrae castle occupied a position north of Aberlemno, Angus , now occupied by Woodwrae farm. The stone was used as a floor slab at the castle and was removed in 1819 to the collection of Sir Walter Scott at Abbotsford House where it resided until it was donated to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland in 1924.\n\nThe stone is a cross-slab high and wide, tapering to at the top, and is thick. The slab is carved on both faces in relief and, as it bears Pictish symbols, it falls into John Romilly Allen and Joseph Anderson's classification system as a class II stone.\n\nThe cross face formerly bore a lobed cross, which has been deliberately erased, although the borders, decorated with interlaced knotwork, keywork and divergent spiral work remain. Also remaining intact are the fantastic creatures in the four quadrants surrounding the cross, including a beast with human legs dangling from its mouth, a feature that exists on other Pictish cross slabs, including the Dunfallandy Stone, as well as Irish High crosses.\n\nThe reverse face has suffered considerable mutilation. It is divided into three sections. The upper section bears a horseman, a Pictish double disc symbol and a step symbol. The lower two thirds of the face holds a second horseman and a variety of other animals, including a bull.\n\nWoodwrae castle was located approximately north of Aberlemno, Angus. This close proximity, and the similarity with the Class II slabs at Aberlemno has long been noted and it has been suggested that the stone originated there. Historian Ross Trench-Jellicoe has postulated, based on similarity of design and execution, an Aberlemno School of Pictish Sculpture, originating from Iona. Stones in the Aberlemno School include Aberlemno 2 (the Kirkyard Stone), Aberlemno 3, Menmuir 1, Kirriemuir 1 and Monifieth 2. To this list, Lloyd Laing has added the stones of Eassie, Rossie Priory, Glamis 1 and Glamis 2.\n"}
