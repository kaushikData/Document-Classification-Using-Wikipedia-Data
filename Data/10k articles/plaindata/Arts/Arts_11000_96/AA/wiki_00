The Standing Committee on Patents and the Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights should solicit views from member countries and the public on elements of such a treaty».\n\nA shared discussion platform on A2K issues is the mailing list of that name, which was initiated around discussion of the Geneva declaration.\nA draft \"A2K treaty\" was later produced. The proposed treaty is intended to ease the transfer of knowledge to developing nations, and to secure the viability of open innovation systems all over the world.\n\nAccess to knowledge and science is protected by Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The article balances the right of access with a right to protection of moral and material interests:\nArticle 27\nEveryone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits.\n\nEveryone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author.\n\nA2K academics argue that “material interests” are not simply equivalent to current intellectual property provisions, not least because these rights are saleable and transferable, and therefore not “inalienable”. The right to access is ultimately the more important part of the right. Current levels of IP protection seem out of balance with Article 27, according to A2K theorists:\n\n... in a very real sense, rights delayed are rights denied. Had access to oral rehydration therapy and second-generation vaccine technologies been delayed for twenty years ... three million children would have died. Even for less life- and-death technologies, a twenty-year delay works an immense limitation on enjoyment of the right. For cultural works, the situation is even worse; protection lasts longer than a human lifetime.\n\nCP Tech (now Knowledge Ecology International) say: \"the A2K (Access to Knowledge) movement takes concerns with copyright law and other regulations that affect knowledge and places them within an understandable social need and policy platform: access to knowledge goods.\"\n\nMany different groups refer to the A2K movement. Consumers International is particularly prominent, running a dedicated domain, and defines the movement as:\n\nthe umbrella term for a movement that aims to create more equitable public access to the products of human culture and learning. The ultimate objective of the movement is to create a world in which educational and cultural works are accessible to all, and in which consumers and creators alike participate in a vibrant ecosystem of innovation and creativity.\nThese goals are of interest to a broad coalition of consumer groups, NGOs, activists, Internet users and others. For many of them, coming to grips with the issues involved in the A2K movement can be daunting. These issues, including copyright and patent law reform, open content licensing, and communications rights, often involve legal and technological concepts that even specialists find difficult.\n\n\n\n"}

He made famous portraits of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama.\n\nHe was one of the first Tibetan artists to study at a Chinese art college.\n\nHe was a student of the Tibetan scholar and artist Gendün Chöphel.\n\nAs a teenager, he became a monk at Drepung Monastery and study traditional Tibetan thangka painting. He left Drepung when he accompanied the Dalai Lama to Beijing in 1954.\n\nThere, he studied traditional Chinese painting and Western painting techniques under the guidance of the Chinese teacher Li Zhongjin.\n\nWhen he came back in Lhasa in 1956, he was commissioned to paint in the Tagtu Mingyur Podrang new palace recently completed in the Norbulingka. His murals merged a traditional Tibetan style with a modern one. The innovation he introduced was that his portraits were easily recognisable.\n\nThe Choekyi Gyaltsen, 10th Panchen Lama, later asked Amdo Jampa a portrait, which he also realised in realist style.\n\nAmdo Jampa travelled to India in the 1980s. He performed paintings for religious buildings for the Dalai Lama in Dharamshala.\n\nHe returned to Lhasa, Tibet. According to Drangchar, a Tibetan magazine, he occupied the official positions of Chairman of the Tibet Fine Arts Association and Chief Research Officer of the Central Executive Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Museum of Cultural Artefacts. He opened an art school in Shol village, before the Potala Palace.\n\nAmdo Jampa's paintings spread in Tibet and influenced Tibetan contemporary painting. \nHence, before 1996 when the Chinese ban on Dalai Lama pictures, many monasteries had such a picture in the style of Amdo Jampa's famous painting of the Dalai Lama.\n\nAccording to Gonkar Gyatso, a Tibetan artist from Lhasa now in the UK, Amdo Jampa is the most important Tibetan modern artist. He was trained in the 1950s at thangka painting and he was the only one to perform original works different from traditional painting and had the support of the 14th Dalai Lama for his creative work. His paintings were partly influenced by painters such as Vittore Carpaccio.\n\nFor Jamyang Norbu, Amdo Jampa was influenced by Gendun Choephel who travelled in India and knew Indian Buddhist and Hindu art as well as European art, as seen in his nudes and dancers. Like other Tibetan artists, Amdo Jampa did not produce anything during the Cultural Revolution years.\n\nEven at an old age, Amdo Jampa walked every day around Lhasa, performing a \"kora\". He was survived by his wife, 2 daughters and 2 sons.\n\n"}

Founded in 1943 by Aileen Osborn Webb, the council today hosts national craft shows and conferences, publishes a bi-monthly magazine called \"American Craft\" and a quarterly journal called \"American Craft Inquiry\", maintains an extensive awards program, and is home to a comprehensive library and archives.\n\nIn 1939, philanthropist and social advocate Aileen Osborn Webb formed the Handcraft Cooperative League of America, an affiliation of craft groups organized to develop markets in metropolitan areas for rural craftsmen. The same year, the American Handcraft Council is formed in Delaware by Anne Morgan, a friend and neighbor of Webb. In 1940, Webb's League opens a cooperative retail venue called America House at 7 East 54th Street in Manhattan. In 1941, they publish a first, untitled issue of what would later become the magazine \"Craft Horizons\". In 1942, Anne Morgan's American Handcraft Council and Aileen Osborn Webb's Handcraft Cooperative League of America merge into a single organization, the American Craftsmen's Cooperative Council, Inc. In 1943, the merged organizations initiate the American Craftsmen's Educational Council, and are granted a provisional charter from the Board of Regents of the Education Department of New York. \nFor the next decade, the Council maintained their New York retail venue, initiated exhibitions featuring practicing craft artists (including \"Designer Craftsmen USA\", which was hosted by the Brooklyn Museum, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the San Francisco Museum of Art), and hosted national competitions such as \"Young Americans\" for craftspeople under 30. In 1955, the American Craftsmen's Education Council shortened its name to the American Craftsmen's Council and the acronym ACC fell into use. \nIn 1956, the Council opened the Museum of Contemporary Crafts, now the Museum of Arts and Design, in a brownstone purchased by Webb at 29 West 53rd Street in New York City. The museum's inaugural exhibition \"Craftsmanship in a Changing World\" featured 314 objects by 180 craftspeople from 19 states. The new building also housed the offices for \"Craft Horizons\" and the council's first formal library space. The Council launched its first national conference and began publishing a newsletter, \"Outlook\", in 1957. In 1959, the Council divests in the retail space America House, which relocates to a brownstone purchased by Webb until closing 1971. In 1960, \"Craft Horizons\" is officially incorporated into the Council and subscribers are automatically enrolled as members. For the next decade, the council continues to host conferences, present and tour exhibitions through the Museum of Contemporary Crafts, and expand educational and awards programs.\n\nIn 1966, ACC held its first regional craft fair in Stowe, Vermont, a precursor to the annual shows the Council continues to present in Baltimore, Atlanta, Saint Paul, and San Francisco. In 1969, one year after celebrating its 25th anniversary, the American Craftsmen's Council changed its name to the American Crafts Council.\n\nThe 1970s bring many significant changes to ACC, including its first cohort of Fellows, elected in 1975. Over 200 craft artists, scholars, and philanthropists have now been honored through induction into the Council's College of Fellows. While continuing to host shows and conferences, the Council relocates in 1978 to 22 West 55th Street and in 1979 the Museum of Contemporary Crafts reopens as the American Craft Museum at 44 West 53rd Street. The same year, \"Craft Horizons\" is renamed \"American Craft\" and founder Aileen Osborn Webb dies at age 87.\n\nAnother series of relocations take place throughout the 1980s, and in 1990 the American Craft Museum becomes independent. At the Council's new, larger space at 72 Spring Street, the library has space to expand throughout the 1990s, taking on significant donations from the estate of glass artist Robert Sowers and from Ed Rossbach and Mildred Constantine. Efforts to develop a computer database for the library began in 1988, and the Council officially launches its website in 1999. In 2001, the library's catalog becomes accessible online.\n\nIn the 2000s, the Council renames and restructures its awards program and begins hosting \"convenings,\" small-scale gatherings of key stakeholders in the field of craft meant to encourage peer-to-peer conversation. In 2010, ACC relocates from New York City to Minneapolis, MN, establishing an office and library in the historic Grain Belt Brewery building at 1224 Marshall Street NE. Not long after the relocation, the Council launches a new website that includes information for both \"American Craft\" magazine and the Council itself. In 2015, ACC launches several programs to highlight and serve emerging artists; Hip Pop, a shows initiative that provides a pathway for emerging artists to successfully take part in ACC shows, and Emerging Voices, an awards program that honors top emerging artist and scholars.\n\n"}

{"id": "21960928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21960928", "title": "Festival book", "text": "Festival book\n\nFestival books (, ) are books, often illustrated, that commemorate a notable event such as a royal entry, coronation or wedding. Funerals were also commemorated in similar fashion. The genre thrived in Renaissance and early modern Europe, where rulers utilized the form to both document and embellish displays of wealth and power.\nLarge numbers were produced, often surviving in very few copies; the largest collection, in the British Library, has over 2000 examples. Originally manuscripts, often illustrated, compiled for prince or city, with the arrival of print they were frequently published, varying in form from short pamphlets describing the order of events, and perhaps recording speeches, to lavish books illustrated with woodcuts or engravings showing the various tableaux, often including a fold-out panorama of the procession, curling to and fro across the page. The pamphlets were ephemera; a printed description of two leaves describing the entry of Ferdinand II of Aragon into Valladolid, 1513, survives in a single copy (at Harvard) because it was bound with another text. A lost description of the ceremonious reception given by Louis XII to Ferdinand at Savona (June 1507) is only known from a purchase receipt of Ferdinand Columbus.\n\nThese \"livrets\" are not always to be trusted as literal records; some were compiled beforehand from the plans, and others after the event from fading memories. The authors or artists engaged in producing the books had by no means always seen the entry themselves. Roy Strong finds that they are \"an idealization of an event, often quite distant from its reality as experienced by the average onlooker. One of the objects of such publications was to reinforce by means of word and image the central ideas that motivated those who conceived the programme.\" Philip II of Spain's ceremonial entry into Antwerp in 1549 was all but called off because of torrential rain, but the book shows it as it should have been. Thomas Dekker, the playwright and author of the book on \"The Magnificent Entertainment\" for James I of England is refreshingly frank:\n\nThe Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian I, went a step further, creating enormous virtual triumphs that existed solely in the form of print. The \"Triumphs of Maximilian\" (begun in 1512 and unfinished at Maximilian's death in 1519) contains over 130 large woodcuts by Albrecht Dürer and other artists, showing a huge procession (still in open country) culminating in the Emperor himself, mounted on a huge car. \"The Triumphal Arch\" (1515), the largest print ever made, at 3.57 x 2.95 metres when the 192 sheets are assembled, was produced in an edition of seven hundred copies for distribution to friendly cities and princes. It was intended to be hand-coloured and then pasted to a wall. Traditional tableau themes, including a large genealogy, and many figures of Virtues, are complemented by scenes of Maximilian's life and military victories. Maximilian was wary of entries in person, having been locked up by his loyal subjects in Bruges in 1488 for eleven weeks, until he could pay the bills from his stay.\n\nAn early meeting between the festival book with travel literature is the account of the visit in 1530 of the future Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, then King of Hungary and Bohemia, to Constantinople.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was educated in his home city of Ghent where he attended high school and university, earning a Ph.D from the Faculty of Arts in 1883, and a degree in law three years later. He then traveled to Germany and Paris to continue his studies, returning to Ghent in 1889 to take up a teaching position the University of Ghent in a variety of subjects such as logic and law.\n\nAfter visiting the 1902 Bruges exhibition of Netherlandish art (\"Exposition de tableaux flamands des XIVe, XVe et XVIe siècles\") he published an independent critical catalogue highlighting the large number of mistakes in the official catalogue which had used attributions and descriptions from the owners. He went on to become a leading scholar in the field. He wrote a separate introduction to the catalogue in which he speculated about the painters' identities (\"De l’identité de certains maîtres anonymes\"), followed by publications about Pieter Bruegel the Elder and Jan Provoost. He was the first art historian to suggest that Robert Campin was in the fact the painter known as the Master of Flemalle and to identify Roger van der Weyden as an apprentice to Campin.\n\nIn 1911 he studied and published a study of the Turin-Milan Hours suggesting a number of miniatures were painted by Hubert and Jan van Eyck, an assertion which continues to be a contentious issue among art historians.\nHulin became active in the art community, sat on committees and associations, and was a consulting editor to \"The Burlington Magazine\". He continued in his teaching position at Ghent University, however, when in 1930 the university became a Flemish speaking institution, he retired soon after. He continued to write, publishing a biography of Roger van der Weyden in 1938. Along with Max Friedländer, who also visited the 1902 Bruges exhibition and wrote a review, Hulin became a leading scholar in the field of Netherlandish art.\n\nHe died unmarried and without children in 1945.\n"}

A handscroll usually measures up to several meters in length and around 25–40 cm in height. Handscrolls are generally viewed starting from the right end. This kind of scroll is intended to be read or viewed flat on a table, in sections. The format thus allows for the depiction of a continuous narrative or journey.\n\nThe handscroll format originated with ancient Chinese text documents. From the Spring and Autumn period (770-481 BCE) through the Han dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE), bamboo or wooden slips were bound together and used to write texts on. During the Eastern Han period (25-220), the use of paper and silk in the handscroll format became more common. The handscroll was the one of the main formats for texts up until the Tang dynasty (618-907). Since the Three Kingdoms (220–280), the handscroll became a standard format for paintings. New styles were developed over time.\n\nA handscroll has a backing of protective and decorative silk (包首) usually bearing a small title label (題籤) on it. In Chinese art, the handscroll usually consists of a frontispiece (引首) at the beginning (right side), the artwork (畫心) itself in the middle, and a colophon section (拖尾) at the end for various inscriptions. The beginning of the scroll, where the frontispiece was located, is known as the \"heaven\" (天頭). Vertical strips (隔水) are sometimes used to separate the different sections. Most handscrolls contain only one painting, although several short paintings can also be mounted on the scroll. At the beginning of the scroll is a wooden stave (天杆), which serves as a support.

It came immediately after High Renaissance and was largely the product of Italian influences. Francis I and his daughter-in-law, Catherine de' Medici, had imported to France a number Italian artists of Raphael's or Michelangelo's school; the Frenchmen who followed them in working in the Mannerist idiom. Besides the work of Italians in France, many Frenchman picked up Italianisms while studying art in Italy during the middle of the century. The Henry II style, though named after Henry II of France, in fact lasted from about 1530 until 1590 under five French monarchs, their mistresses and their queens. \n\nThe most lasting products of the Henry II style were architectural. First Rosso Fiorentino and then Francesco Primaticcio and Sebastiano Serlio served Henry II as court artisans, constructing his gallery and the Aile de la Belle Cheminée (1568). The French architect Pierre Lescot and the sculptor Jean Goujon rebuilt the Palais du Louvre around the now famous square court. The Château d'Anet, commissioned by Diane de Poitiers, mistress of Henry II, was designed by Philibert Delorme, who studied in Rome. The very mannerist château housed a statue of Diana by Benvenuto Cellini, who was working in France. In 1564 Delorme began work on the Tuileries, the most outstanding Parisian \"palais\" of the Henry II style. It too exhibited a mannerist treatment of classical themes, for which Delorm had developed his own \"French order\" of columns. \nJean Bullant, another architect who studied in Rome, also produced designs that combined classical \"themes\" in a mannerist structure. The Château d'Écouen and the Château de Chantilly, both for Anne de Montmorency, exemplify the Henry II-style château, which was proliferating among the nobility. A very thorough catalogue of engravings of sixteenth-century French architecture was produced by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau the Elder under the title \"Les plus excellents bastiments de France\" (between 1576 and 1579, in two volumes). Much of the buildings so engraved have been destroyed (like the Tuileries) or significantly altered (like Écouen), so that Cerceau's reproductions are the best guide to the Henry II style. \nIn painting, like in architecture, the French were influenced by Italian mannerism and many Italian painters and sculptors were active members of the First School of Fontainebleau, which in turn produced an active and talented crop of native painters and sculptors, such as Germain Pilon and Juste de Juste. By the end of the century the Henry II style, a Gallicised form of Italian mannerism, had been replaced by a more consistent classicism, with hints of the coming Baroque. Its immediately successor in French art historiography is the Henry IV style.\n\n"}

It was first published anonymously in Venice, by the end of 1720. Virtually every aspect of \"opera seria\" and its social environment is mercilessly criticized by Marcello: the artificiality of plots, the stereotyped format of music, the extravagant scenography and machinery, the inability and venality of composers and poets, the vanity and vulgarity of singers, the avidity of impresarios, the ineptitude of musicians.\nThe full title reads \"THE FASHIONABLE THEATER – OR – safe and easy METHOD for correctly composing and performing Italian OPERAS in the modern style, – In which – useful and necessary Advice is given to Librettists, Composers, Musicians of both sexes, Impresarios, Performers, Engineers, and Scene Painters, comic Characters, Tailors, Pages, Dancers, Prompters, Copyists, Protectors, and MOTHERS of female Virtuoso singers, & other People belonging to Theater.\" In fact, \"Il teatro alla moda\" is written as a series of chapters where advice is ironically given to the various people involved in operatic productions, in order to meet \"the modern customs\" and bizarre requirements of such theatrical events.\n\nBesides the title, the frontispiece contains several allusions to well-known protagonists of the Venetian theater of the time. For instance, the publisher's name \"Aldiviva Licante\" refers, by means of anagrams, both to Antonio Vivaldi, then very famous as an opera composer, and to the singer Caterina Canteli.\n\nThe text of \"Il teatro alla moda\" displays several striking features. To begin with, it shows a degree of vacillation in attitude toward its subject — perhaps resulting from Marcello's personal ambivalence regarding operatic music, as both a critic and a composer. For example, the dedicatory is by \"the author of the book to its composer.\" In addition, it exhibits a number of surrealistic elements, which reach a climax in the last chapter, \"The Raffle\" (presumably organized by the mother of a young female singer), where the prizes include \"a full dress of modern poet in fever-colored tree bark, wrapped with metaphors, translations, hyperboles\" as well as \"the pen that wrote \"Il teatro alla moda\".\" The printing accompanies these peculiarities with a chaotic use of italic and normal typography and of capital fonts.\n\n\"To the Poets – In the first place, the \"modern\" Poet should not have read and should never read the ancient Authors, \"Latin\" or \"Greek\". And this is because the ancient \"Greeks\" or \"Latins\" have never read the \"moderns\".\"\n\n\"To the Music Composers – The \"modern\" Music Composer should possess no knowledge about the \"Rules\" of good composition, except for some principle of universal practice... He should not understand the \"numeric Musical Proportions\", nor the optimal effect of \"contrary Motions\", or the \"bad Relation\" of \"Tritones\" and \"augmented Intervals\".\"\n\"To the Singers – It is not necessary that the VIRTUOSO can \"read\", or \"write\", or have a \"good pronunciation of vowels, and of single and double Consonants, or understand the sense of Words\", etc., but it is better if he mistakes \"Senses, Letters, Syllables\", etc., in order to perform \"Ornaments, Trills, Appoggiature, very long Cadences\", etc. etc. etc.\"\n\n\"To the Mothers of Female Singers – When the \"Girls\" have an audition with the Impresario, \"they\" (the mothers) \"will move the mouth with them\", will \"prompt\" them the usual \"Ornaments\" and \"Trills\" and, asked about the age of the \"Virtuosa\", will cut down at least \"ten years\".\"\n\n"}

Thanks to the efforts of Henryk Struve, in 1877-80 a twelve-volume edition of Kremer's collected works was published in Warsaw. No other Polish philosopher contemporary of Kremer's could boast such a publication.\n\nKremer's most important achievement in psychology was the systematic division of psychic phenomena into the conscious and the unconscious, and the treatment of anthropology as a science which probes the mutual relations between these two.

{"id": "3344431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3344431", "title": "Lois Weber", "text": "Lois Weber\n\nLois Weber (June 13, 1879 – November 13, 1939) was an American silent film actress, screenwriter, producer, and director. She is identified in some historical references as \"the most important female director the American film industry has known\", and among “the most important and prolific film directors in the era of silent films\". Film historian Anthony Slide has also asserted, \"Along with D.W. Griffith, Weber was the American cinema's first genuine auteur, a filmmaker involved in all aspects of production and one who utilized the motion picture to put across her own ideas and philosophies.\"\n\nWeber produced an \"oeuvre\", which Jennifer Parchesky argues is comparable to Griffith's in both quantity and quality, and brought to the screen her concerns for humanity and social justice in an estimated 200 to 400 films, of which as few as twenty have been preserved, and has been credited by IMDb with directing 135 films, writing 114, and acting in 100. Weber was \"one of the first directors to come to the attention of the censors in Hollywood's early years\".\n\nWeber has been credited as pioneering the use of the split screen technique to show simultaneous action in her 1913 film \"Suspense\". In collaboration with her first husband, Phillips Smalley, in 1913 Weber was \"one of the first directors to experiment with sound\", making the first sound films in the United States, and was also the first American woman to direct a full-length feature film when she and Smalley directed \"The Merchant of Venice\" in 1914, and in 1917 the first woman director to own her own film studio.\n\nDuring the war years, Weber \"achieved tremendous success by combining a canny commercial sense with a rare vision of cinema as a moral tool\". At her zenith, \"few men, before or since, have retained such absolute control over the films they have directed – and certainly no women directors have achieved the all-embracing, powerful status once held by Lois Weber.\" By 1920, Weber was considered the \"premier woman director of the screen and author and producer of the biggest money making features in the history of the film business\".\n\nAmong Weber's notable films are: the controversial \"Hypocrites\", which featured the first full-frontal female nude scene in 1915; the 1916 film \"Where Are My Children?\", which discussed abortion and birth control, and was added to the National Film Registry in 1993; her adaptation of Edgar Rice Burrough's \"Tarzan of the Apes\" novel for the very first Tarzan of the Apes film in 1918; and what is often considered her masterpiece, \"The Blot\" in 1921.\n\nWeber is credited with discovering, mentoring, or making stars of several women actors, including Mary MacLaren, Mildred Harris, Claire Windsor, Esther Ralston, Billie Dove, Ella Hall, Cleo Ridgely, and Anita Stewart, and discovered and inspired screenwriter Frances Marion. For her contribution to the motion picture industry, on February 8, 1960, Weber was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nFlorence Lois Weber was born on June 13, 1879 in Allegheny City, Pennsylvania (since 1907 Pittsburgh's Northside neighborhood), the second of three children of Mary Matilda \"Tillie\" Snaman (born Mathilda Schneeman in March 1854 in Reserve Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania; died 1935 in Miami, Florida) and George Weber (born June 1855; died about 1910), an upholster and decorator, who had spent several years in missionary street work, and the younger sister of Elizabeth \"Bessie\" Snaman Weber Jay (born April 9, 1877 in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania; died February 26, 1966 in Florida) and older sister of Ethel Weber Howland (born July 3, 1887 in Pennsylvania), who later appeared in two of Florence's films in 1916, and married assistant director Louis A. \"Lou\" Howland.\n\nThe Webers were a devout middle class Christian family of Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.\n\nWeber was considered a child prodigy, and an excellent pianist. As a girl, music was her passion, and her most treasured possession was a baby grand piano. Weber left home and lived in poverty while working as a street-corner evangelist and social activist for two years with the evangelical Church Army Workers, an organization similar to the Salvation Army, preaching and singing hymns on street-corners and singing and playing the organ in rescue missions in red-light districts in Pittsburgh and New York, until the Church Army Workers disbanded in 1900.\n\nIn June 1900, Weber was almost 21 and was living with her parents and two sisters at 1717 Fremont Street, Allegheny, Pennsylvania, where she was a music student. By April 1903, Weber was performing as a soprano singer and pianist. She toured the United States as a concert pianist with renowned harpist Mrs Apt Thomas until her final performance in Charleston, South Carolina a year later. After an unfortunate incident when a piano key broke during a recital, Weber retired from the concert stage, having lost her nerve to play in public. Weber describes the incident that precipitated her retirement: \"Just as I started to play a black key came off in my hand. I kept forgetting that the key was not there, and reaching for it. The incident broke my nerve. I could not finish and I never appeared on the concert stage again. It is my belief that when that key came off in my hand, a certain phase of my development came to an end.\"\n\nFrustrated by the futility of one-on-one conversions, and following the advice of an uncle in Chicago, Weber decided to take up acting about 1904, and moved to New York City, where she took some singing lessons. Weber later explained her motivation: \"As I was convinced the theatrical profession needed a missionary, he suggested that the best way to reach them was to become one of them so I went on the stage filled with a great desire to convert my fellowman\".\n\nFor five years Weber was a repertory and stock actress. After short stint as a soubrette in the farce comedy \"Zig-Zag\" for a Chicago-based touring company, Weber resigned as it \"proved too superficial for her altruistic aims\". In 1904, Weber joined the road company of \"Why Girls Leave Home\", where she became \"a musical comedy \"prima donna\" and melodrama heroine\". Weber received \"promising reviews\" for her performance, for example, \"The Boston Globe\" wrote of her in September 1904 that she \"sang two very pretty songs very effectively and won considerable applause\".\n\nThe troupe's leading man and manager was Wendell Phillips Smalley (1865–1939), a grandson of Oliver Wendell Holmes, and the elder son of \"New York Tribune\" war and foreign correspondent George Washburn Smalley (1833–1916) and Phoebe Garnaut Phillips (1841–1923), the adopted daughter of abolitionist Wendell Phillips.\n\nSmalley, who had attended Balliol College, Oxford and was a graduate of Harvard University, had been a lawyer in New York for seven years, and a stage actor who made his professional stage debut in August 1901 in Manhattan. He had appeared in productions of Harrison Grey Fiske, Minnie Maddern Fiske, and Raymond Hitchcock. After a brief acquaintance, just before her 25th birthday, Weber and Smalley, aged 38, married on April 29, 1904 in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nAfter initially touring separately from her husband, and then accompanying him on his tours, about 1906 Weber left her career in the theater and became a homemaker in New York. During this period Weber wrote freelance moving picture scenarios.\n\nIn 1908, Weber was hired by American Gaumont Chronophones, which produced \"phonoscènes\", initially as a singer of songs recorded for the chronophone. Both Herbert Blaché and his wife, Alice Guy, later claimed to have given Weber her start in the movie industry.\n\nAt the end of the 1908 theatrical season, Smalley joined Weber at Gaumont. Soon Weber was writing scripts, and in 1908 Weber began directing English language \"phonoscènes\" at the Gaumont Studio in Flushing, New York. In 1915 Weber directed and starred in a film she had written called \"Hypocrites\". In 1910, Weber and Smalley decided to pursue a career in the infant motion picture industry. For the next five years, they worked and were credited as The Smalleys (but where typically Weber received sole writing credit) on dozens of shorts and features for small production companies like Gaumont, the New York Motion Picture Co., Reliance Studio, the Rex Motion Picture Company, and Bosworth, where Weber wrote scenarios and subtitles, acted, directed, designed sets and costumes, edited films, and even developed negatives. Weber took two years off her birth date when she signed her first movie contract.\n\nWeber and Smalley had a daughter, Phoebe, named after Smalley's mother, who was born on October 29, 1910, but died in infancy.\n\nBy 1911, Weber and Smalley were working for William Swanson's Rex Motion Picture Company, which was based at 573–579 11th Avenue, New York City. While at Rex, Weber gained her reputation as \"a serious social uplifter and as the leading partner in the Weber-Smalley unit.\" In 1911, Weber acted in and directed her first silent short film, \"A Heroine of '76\", sharing the directorial duties with Smalley and Edwin S. Porter. At the time of Rex's merger with five other studios to form the Universal Film Manufacturing Company on April 30, 1912, Weber and Smalley were the \"prima facie heads of Rex\", and had relocated to Los Angeles.\n\nRex continued as a subsidiary of Universal, with Weber and Smalley running it, making one two-reel film each week, until they left Rex in September 1912. Carl Laemmle startled the film industry with his use of and advocacy for women directors and producers, including Weber, Ida May Park and Cleo Madison. In the autumn of 1913, shortly after the incorporation of Universal City, Weber was elected its first mayor in a close contest that required a recount, and Laura Oakley as police chief. At the time, Universal's publicity department claimed Universal City was \"the only municipality in the world that possesses an entire outfit of women officials\".\nIn March 1913, Weber starred in the first English language version of Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\", which was produced for the New York Motional Picture Co., directed by Smalley, from an adaptation by Weber, and starred Wallace Reid as Dorian Gray.\n\nIn 1913, Weber and Smalley collaborated in directing a ten-minute thriller, \"Suspense\", based on the play \"Au Telephone\" by André de Lorde, which had been filmed in 1908 as \"Heard over the 'Phone\" by Edwin S. Porter. Adapted by Weber, it used multiple images and mirror shots to tell of a woman (Weber) threatened by a burglar (Douglas Gerrard).\n\nWeber is credited with pioneering the use of the split screen technique to show simultaneous action in this film, but the \"oft-mentioned triptych shots had already been used in the Danish \"The White Slave Trade\" films (\"Den hvide slavehandel\") (1910), also for telephone conversations.\" According to Tom Gunning, \"No film made before WWI shows a stronger command of film style than Suspense [which] outdoes even Griffith for emotionally involved filmmaking\". \"Suspense\" was released on July 6, 1913.\n\nIn late 1913, Weber and Smalley made \"The Jew's Christmas\", a three-reel silent film that dramatizes the conflict between traditional Jewish values and American customs and values, illustrating the challenges of cultural assimilation, especially the generational conflict over interfaith marriage and the second generation's abandonment of the faith and customs of their ancestors. In \"the earliest portrayal of a rabbi in an American film\", \"The Jew's Christmas\" told the story of an orthodox rabbi (Smalley) who ostracizes his daughter (Weber) for marrying a gentile, but is reconciled twelve years later on Christmas Eve when he meets an impoverished small child, who turns out to be his granddaughter. Endeavoring to combat racial discrimination and antisemitism, the film aims to show that love is stronger than any religious ties, and that \"the tie of blood overbears the pride and prejudice of religion\". In its assertion of \"Melting-pot idealism\" by its approval of intermarriage between people of different religions, the film was considered controversial at the time of its release. on December 18, 1913.\n\nIn 1914, a year in which she directed 27 movies, Weber became \"one of the first directors to come to the attention of the censors\". That year, Weber co-directed an adaptation of Shakespeare's \"The Merchant of Venice\" with Smalley, who also played Shylock. making her the first American woman to direct a feature-length film in the United States, and the first person who \"directed the first feature-length Shakespearean comedy\". In February 1914, Universal released the four-reel Rex silent film which was also adapted by Weber and Smalley, and was also produced, directed, and starred Weber as Portia, and Smalley as Shylock. The film featured Douglas Gerrard, Rupert Julian, and Jeanie MacPherson, who would play a major role in cinema as Cecil B. DeMille's favorite screenwriter.\n\nA \"prominent rabbi in Chicago strongly objected on the grounds that the play 'more than any other book, more than any other influence in the history of the world, is responsible for the world-wide prejudice against the Jews'\", but the film was praised at the time as \"a supreme adaptation of Shakespeare\". Robert Hamilton Ball considered the film \"careful, respectful, dignified, but lacking in passion and poetry\", which he attributes to the difficulty it had satisfying the censor, and because the film was a special release rather than a release on the regular programme, exhibitors had to pay extra for it, which may have contributed to its swift demise. \"The Merchant of Venice\" is now considered a lost film.\n\nOne film that illustrates the paradoxical nature of Weber's role and films was her 1914 film \"The Spider and Her Web\", where she advocates both modesty and maternalism. In this film, Weber plays \"The Spider\", a vamp living the \"ultra-modern high life\" who seduces and ruins intellectual men until frightened into adopting an orphan baby, which results in the salvation of the lead character through motherhood.\n\nAs Universal was reluctant to make feature-length films, in the summer of 1914 Weber was persuaded to move to the Bosworth company by Julia Crawford Ivers, the first woman general manager of a film studio, to take over the production duties from Hobart Bosworth on a $50,000 a year contract, making her \"the best known, most respected and highest-paid\" of the dozen or so women directors in Hollywood at that time.\n\nIn 1914, Bertha Smith estimated Weber's audience at five to six million a week. In fact, by 1915 Weber was as famous as D.W. Griffith and Cecil B. de Mille. While at Bosworth, Weber and Smalley made six features and one short, \"The Traitor\".\n\n\"Energized by evangelistic zeal and social conscience\", from early in her career Weber saw movies as \"a vehicle for evangelism\", and \"an opportunity to preach to the masses\", and to encourage her audience to be involved in progressive causes.\n\nIn a 1914 interview Weber declared: \"In moving pictures I have found my life's work. I find at once an outlet for my emotions and my ideals. I can preach to my heart's content, and with the opportunity to write the play, act the leading role, and direct the entire production, if my message fails to reach someone, I can blame only myself.\" As many of Weber's films focused on a moral topic, she \"was often mistaken as a Christian fundamentalist, but she was more of a libertarian, opposing censorship and the death penalty and championing birth control. The need for a strong, loving and nurturing home was clearly promoted as well and if there was a single maxim that underlay each film it was that selfishness and egocentricity erode the individual and community\".\n\nAlthough not a practicing Christian Scientist, Weber attended the Christian Science church regularly, according to Adela Rogers St. Johns, and, in at least two of her films, \"Jewel\" (1915) and its remake, \"A Chapter in Her Life\" (1923), Christian Science plays a prominent role. Weber's impeccable reputation and \"impressive middle-class credentials\" allowed her considerable artistic freedom in her presentation of controversial issues.\n\nIn 1914, Weber made her first major feature, a controversial version of \"Hypocrites\", a four-reel allegorical drama shot at Universal City which she wrote, directed and produced, addressing social themes and moral lessons considered daring for the time. \"Hypocrites\" included the first film full-frontal female nudity, inspired by Jules Joseph Lefebvre's 1870 allegorical painting \"La Vérité\", with truth portrayed in the ghostly figure of the Naked Truth, literally shown by an unidentified nude woman (Margaret Edwards).\n\nMargaret Sinclair Edwards (born 1877, New York City – died January 14, 1929, New York City), known on the stage as \"Daisy Sinclair\", appeared with the theatrical companies of Edward Harrigan, Eddie Foy, and Gus Edwards, among others. Her husband, John Edwards, an invalid, died the same year she did (1929). She appeared as Marguerite Edwards in \"A Physical Culture Romance\" in 1914, and in Weber's \"Sunshine Molly\" in 1915. Although the nudity was tastefully done (it was passed by the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures after a two-month delay), it was still banned in Ohio; caused riots in New York; and James Michael Curley, the mayor of Boston, demanded that every frame displaying the naked figure of Truth be hand-painted to clothe the then unidentified actress.\n\n\"Hypocrites\" was released finally by Bosworth on January 15, 1915, and premiered at Manhattan's prestigious Longacre Theatre, and was \"celebrated as a cultural, artistic, and moral landmark for the film industry\", and \"praised for its use of multiple exposures and complex film editing\". While its negative cost was $18,000, it earned $119,000 in sales in the United States alone and made Weber \"a household name\". In a 1917 interview, Weber denied the film was indecent and defended the film: \"Hypocrites is not a slap at any church or creed – it is a slap at hypocrites, and its effectiveness is shown by the outcry amongst those it hits hardest, to have the film stopped\".\n\nIn April 1915, Weber and Smalley left Bosworth when the founder left the company due to ill health. After being promised they could make feature-length films by Carl Laemmle, they returned to Universal Pictures. Weber's first movie for Universal was \"Scandal\", in which both Weber and Smalley starred, that featured the consequences of gossip mongering.\n\nIn 1916, Weber directed 10 feature-length films for release by Universal, nine of which she also wrote, and she also became Universal Studios' highest-paid director, earning $5,000 a week, and \"enjoyed complete freedom in overseeing most stages of the film-making process – choice of stories and actors, writing of scripts (which she invariably did herself), as well as direction\". Universal head Carl Laemmle, \"who was known more for his frugality and cunning business sense than philanthropy\", said of Weber: \"I would trust Miss Weber with any sum of money that she needed to make any picture that she wanted to make. I would be sure that she would bring it back.\"\n\nIn 1916, Weber explained her philosophy of directing films: \"I'll never be convinced that the general public does not want serious entertainment rather than frivolous\", and \"A real director should be absolute. He (or she in this case) alone knows the effects he wants to produce, and he alone should have authority in the arrangement, cutting, titling or anything else that may seem necessary to do to the finished product. What other artist has his work interfered with by someone else?... We ought to realize that the work of a picture director, worthy of a name, is creative\".\n\n In February 1916, Weber and Smalley were transferred to Universal's Bluebird Photoplays brand, where they made a dozen features, including \"The Dumb Girl of Portici\" (also known as \"Pavlowa\"), adapted by Weber from Daniel Auber's 1828 opera \"La muette de Portici\", Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova's only screen appearance, which was directed to Pavlova's satisfaction by Weber. The film also starred Rupert Julian as Masaniello. Released to popular acclaim, it premiered on April 3, 1916 at the Globe Theatre in Manhattan.\n\nHoping to \"become the editorial page of the studio\", and to \"provoke a middle-class sense of responsibility for those less fortunate than themselves, and to stimulate moral reforms\", Weber specialized in making films that stressed both high quality and moral rectitude, including films of the \"burning social and moral issues of the day\", among them such controversial themes as abortion, eugenics, and birth control in \"Where Are My Children?\" (1916), influenced by the trial of Charles Stielow, an innocent man who was almost executed, opposition to capital punishment based on circumstantial evidence in \" The People vs. John Doe\"; and alcoholism and opium addiction in \"Hop, the Devil's Brew\", which were all successful at the box office, but, while embraced by reformers in the film industry, \"drew the ire of the conservatives\". Despite the predominance of strong women in her films, in 1916 Weber disassociated herself from the women's suffrage movement.\n\nIn \"Where Are My Children?\" (working title: \"The Illborn\"), which was released on April 16, 1916, Weber advocates social purity, birth control, and eugenics to prevent the \"deterioration of the race\" and the \"proliferation of the lower classes\", and makes \"an indirect case for birth control or perhaps even for legalized, and safe, abortions\". The film starred Tyrone Power, Sr. and his then-wife Helen Riaume; future star Mary MacLaren made her debut. It also makes use of several trick photography scenes, with an emphasis on multiple exposures to convey information or emotions visually. As a recurring motif, every time a character becomes pregnant, a child's face is double exposed over their shoulder.\n\nIn March 1916, the National Board of Review expressed disapproval of the film for showings to mixed audiences, but later approved it for adult showings. It was banned in Pennsylvania on the grounds that it \"tended to debase or corrupt morals\", but Universal won a case in Brooklyn, New York in 1916 to show the film after the district attorney filed suit against the theater manager and the Universal exchange president. Controversy, the threat of censorship, and the banning of \"Where Are My Children?\" in some locations helped fuel the box office success of the film, estimated to have grossed in excess of $3 million, in an era where ticket prices were less than 50c each, and \"rocketed Weber's name to larger audiences, bigger box-office returns, and an even higher annual income\". The film spread Weber's fame internationally. For example, Kevin Brownlow indicates that this film attracted 30,000 in Preston, Lancashire, 40,000 in Bradford, Yorkshire, and 100,000 in two weeks in Sydney. In 2000, the Library of Congress Motion Picture Conservation Center copyrighted a preservation print reconstructed from several incomplete prints.\n\n\"Shoes\", a \"sociological\" film released in June 1916 that Weber directed for the Bluebird Photoplays, was based on the 1912 novel \"A New Conscience and an Ancient Evil\" by noted social reformer Jane Addams and depicts the struggles of working class women for consumer goods and upward mobility and their dubious sexual activities, including prostitution. Starring Mary Maclaren as Eva Meyer, a poverty-stricken shopgirl who supports her family of five, who needs to replace her only pair of shoes, and is so desperate that she sells her virginity for a new pair, it proved to be the most booked Bluebird production of 1916. A version restored digitally from three extant fragments by EYE Film Institute Netherlands, made its debut in North America in July 2011.\n\nA scene from the restored \"Shoes\" showing architect John B. Parkinson's 1910 design for Pershing Square in Downtown Los Angeles has been used by the grassroots Pershing Square Restoration Society in promoting their campaign to restore the historic park.\n\nAfter another significant censorship battle, and a vigorous publicity campaign by Universal, on May 13, 1917, Universal released \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\", \"one of the most forceful films ever made in support of legalizing birth control\", a follow-up to the previous year's top money-maker for Universal, \"Where Are My Children?\" Directed by Weber and Smalley based on their original script, it starred Smalley and Weber, in her last screen appearance, as a doctor's wife arrested and imprisoned for illegally disseminating family planning information. Influenced by the recent trial and imprisonment of pioneer birth control advocate Margaret Sanger, the film drew explicitly on her headline-generating activism.\n\nThe film was released only weeks after Sanger's own film, \"Birth Control\", was banned under a 1915 ruling of the United States Supreme Court that films \"did not constitute free speech\", and the ruling of the New York Court of Appeals that a film on family planning may be censored \"in the interest of morality, decency, and public safety and welfare\". Sensitive to the opinions of local communities, and hoping to avoid powerful censorship boards in the northeast and midwest, \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\" was distributed primarily in the southern and western regions of the United States, with the result that it did not attain the record-breaking attendance set by \"Where Are My Children?\" the previous year. When \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\" opened at Clune's Auditorium in Los Angeles in June 1917, Weber appeared on stage, bitterly denouncing attempts to alter or suppress her film. While \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\" is now lost, the surviving script and accompanying marketing materials make it clear that Weber mounted an unstinting argument in favor of \"voluntary motherhood\".\n\nIn June 1917 Weber became the first American female director to establish and run her own movie studio when she formed her own production company, Lois Weber Productions, with the financial assistance of Universal. She leased a self-contained estate, and had offices, dressing rooms, scenic and property rooms, and a shooting stage constructed. Smalley was made studio manager, and the Smalleys made their home on the studio lot at 1550 N. Sierra Bonita Avenue.\n\nAccording to film historian Shelley Stamp, while Weber and Smalley were often co-credited as directors, it was \"the wife who clearly had the artistic vision to drive the business partnership forward\". By this time, Weber's \"idealized collaborative marriage\" with Smalley had begun to show signs of deterioration, which was accelerated by the increased focus of critics and journalists on Weber as the dominant filmmaker, at the expense of Smalley, after 1916, and Weber increasingly took credit for her contributions after 1917. However, as early as 1913, some saw Weber as the \"fertile brain\" in the partnership, with Smalley seen as an indolent womanizer \"who chased every woman on the lot\", which resulted in arguments and shouting matches.\n\nWeber consciously resisted the industry's movement toward assembly line-style studio film making. \"By concentrating on only one production at a time, and mobilizing her entire work force around that effort, Weber aimed for quality film making rather than efficient bookkeeping\". Weber's independence allowed her to shoot her films in sequence, as she preferred (rather than out of order to suit production schedules). William D. Routt indicates that \"Lois Weber Productions were a good investment, cost-effective. The company made movies cheaply: in later years at least shooting on location even for interiors, using a small cast, working fast. Its somewhat sensational topics and titles guaranteed at least a modest box office return, and at times may have done much better than that.\"\n\nKaren Ward Mahar attributes the success of Weber's films of the 1910s to their representation of \"the generational conflict of the era\" between the traditional view of women and that of the freedoms of the emerging \"New Woman and the emergent consumer culture\". Mahar argues that \"Weber's life was an expression of this generational divide: she was a stage performer and a Church Army Worker, a filmmaker and a middle-class matron, a childless advocate of birth control who 'radiates domesticity'\". While Weber was clearly a New Woman by virtue of her career, she was also publicly identified as the wife and collaborator of her first husband.\n\nShelley Stamp argues that Weber's \"image was instrumental in defining both her particular place in film-making practices, and women's roles within early Hollywood generally\", and that her \"wifely, bourgeois persona, relatively conservative and staid, mirrored the film industry's idealized conception of its new customers: white, married, middle-class women perceived to be arbiters of taste in their communities\". While Weber's beliefs reflected modern values, as did her career as a filmmaker that was atypical for women of her era, she had \"internalized much of what the Victorians deemed proper behavior for women\", and there are \"strong elements of the Victorian code of womanhood in her films\". The Smalleys exemplified and promoted the Victorian ideal of marriage as companionship and a partnership.\n\nIn 1917, Weber was the only woman granted membership in the Motion Picture Directors Association, and from 1917 Weber was active in supporting the newly established Hollywood Studio Club, a residence for struggling would-be starlets. After the United States entered World War I, Weber served on the board of the Motion Picture War Service Association, headed by D. W. Griffith and including Mack Sennett, Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Cecil B. DeMille, and William Desmond Taylor. The Association raised funds for the construction of a thousand-bed hospital.\n\nIn 1918, the Fox Film Corporation hired Weber to direct \"Queen of the Seas\", in which Annette Kellerman swam and dove naked. However, she was replaced eventually by John G. Adolfi. In September 1918, Weber broke her left arm in two places when she fell in Barker Brothers, a downtown Los Angeles store, forcing her to be hospitalized in the California Hospital. Weber's arm was still causing her trouble seven months later.\n\nDespite continuing to work at Universal, and renting out her studio to other independent producers, including Marshall Neilan, Weber found it difficult to pay the bills and to find the capital to finance her own productions. By December 1918, Weber had left Universal, and signed a contract with Louis B. Mayer to direct Anita Stewart for $3,500 a week. In a letter to Weber, Mayer proclaimed: \"My unchanging policy will be great star, great director, great play, great cast. You are authorized to get these without stint or limit. Spare nothing, neither expense, time, or effort. Results only are what I'm after.\" Weber made two films with Stewart as the lead: \"A Midnight Romance\" and \"Mary Regan\", both released in 1919 to mixed reviews.\n\nNeeding finances, in July 1919 Weber signed a contract with Famous Players-Lasky to direct five films to be distributed through Paramount-Artcraft for $50,000 each, plus one-third of the profits, and guaranteed first-run bookings in Paramount theaters. By January 1920, Smalley and Weber purchased a two-level home at 1917 N. Ivar Avenue, Hollywood, later the home of Preston Sturges in the 1940s.\n\nIn October 1920, Weber purchased the studio facilities at 4634 Santa Monica Boulevard in Los Angeles, near Sunset Boulevard, which she had been leasing for the previous three years.\n\nBy February 1921, Weber was at the zenith of her career, and regarded \"as fearless in the production of her pictures as she once was in her struggle for a living, and her indubitable position is that of one of the best directors of the screen\", One newspaper wrote, \"Lois Weber is not only the foremost woman director-she's the whole works\", and attributed her success to having \"a feminine touch lacking in most man-made films\". In an effort to protect the American film industry, by 1921 Weber advocated the prohibition of the importation of all European films into the United States. In May 1921, Weber anticipated the possibility of both color and \"three-dimensional films\".\n\nFollowing \"the cinematic rumination on modern marriage begun by Cecil B. DeMille\", and like other post-war filmmakers, Weber turned her attention toward marriage and domestic life to honor her deal with Famous Players-Lasky with such melodramas as \"To Please One Woman\", \"What's Worth While?\" \"Too Wise Wives\", and \"What Do Men Want?\" However, as the United States entered the Jazz Age in the 1920s, Weber, came to be seen as passé, in part because of her \"propensity for didacticism\", but also because her \"values became increasingly archaic; her moralising, propagandistic tone was unsuited to the era of the 'flapper' girl and a hedonism that seemed all the more urgent\".\n\nBy this time her \"morally upright films bored modern audiences\", her crusading was unwanted, and her views were considered \"quaint\". Her fall from favor was also due to her inability or unwillingness to adapt to changing audience tastes, and \"her refusal to feature big-name stars or to glamorize consumerist excess in her films.\"\n\nAfter an advance screening in February 1921, Paramount executives decided not to distribute the fourth film in their arrangement with Weber, \"What Do Men Want?\" a domestic melodrama about a philandering husband and a faithful wife (Claire Windsor), and to cancel their arrangement with Weber to distribute her films.\n\nAfter making 13 films, by April 1921, Lois Weber Productions collapsed, and Weber was forced to release all her contracted staff, with the exception of two novice actors. While she would direct a few other movies, effectively her career as a Hollywood director was over.\n\nAfter reading the articles \"Impoverished College Teaching\" and \"Boycotting the Ministry\" in the April 30, 1921 issue of \"Literary Digest\" about the underpayment of educators and clergy, Weber, with scenarist Marion Orth, crafted a melodramatic narrative to bring the issue to life in \"The Blot\". Starring Claire Windsor and Louis Calhern, \"The Blot\", was her masterpiece, her most successful film from this period, and probably Weber's best-known film today. The film \"rejects the values of capitalist America that measures the value of people in wealth and property\" by depicting the compromises and choices impoverished women are forced to make to achieve social mobility and financial security. It \"condemns capitalistic materialism and linked consumerism with sexual exploitation\", and addresses class, money, and ethnicity, \"Weber's basically Christian ethos shines clearly through this plot: the text disapproves of both the new consumerist immigrant class, and the old aristocratic one\". Despite xenophobic assumptions, Weber advocates learning, asceticism, and service to the needy.\n\nAccording to film historian Kevin Brownlow, in \"The Blot\" \"Weber's technique is reminiscent of that of William C. deMille, with its quietness, in its use of detail, and its emphasis on naturalism. Weber used the same method of direction, too, filming in continuity.\" To tell with maximum realism this story of a college professor's family – hardworking but with only a meager income – Weber filmed in real houses, using a special lighting rig, and gave supporting roles to non-actors. To emphasize this film was a woman-centered narrative, in a \"radical departure from Hollywood practice\", Weber used point-of-view cutting from the perspective of the professor's wife. Weber also used extreme close-ups and an ambiguous ending, that Richard Combs describes \"The Blot\" as \"so un-Griffithian as to seem almost modernistically open-ended\", while others see it as almost surreal, declaring it \"the \"Los Olvidados\" of the literally down at heel middle class\".\n\nDue to the collapse of her distribution deal with Paramount, Weber was forced to distribute \"The Blot\" through the F.B. Warren Corporation, a newly formed small independent company that would also distribute a film each by Canadian women producers Nell Shipman and May Tully, later in 1921. \"The Blot\" was released on September 4, 1921, but was not well-received critically and did little box office, and vanished after its run. After \"The Blot\", Weber's films did not make money at the box office. For decades, \"The Blot\" was considered a lost film, until it was rediscovered by the American Film Institute in 1975, and was reconstituted and restored by Robert Gitt of the UCLA Film & Television Archive in 1986 from an incomplete negative and an incomplete print. \"The Blot\" was then produced for video by Kevin Brownlow and David Gill of Photoplay Productions, and released on home video and DVD.\n\nAs part of the deal to distribute \"The Blot\", F.B. Warren also released \"What Do Men Want?\" After the film's premiere at Manhattan's Lyric Theatre on November 13, 1921, \"The New York Times\", while praising Weber for her casting and the technical aspects of the film, and also the performance of Claire Windsor, dismissed the film as a \"simplified sermon\" that provided \"pat answers\" which ignored \"the real facts of life\", which it considers \"incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial\".\n\nSoon after the New York city premiere of \"The Blot\", and in an attempt to salvage their troubled marriage, Weber and Smalley sailed for Europe, with Weber's sister and brother-in-law, Ethel and Louis A. Howland. They ultimately traveled for six months through Europe, Egypt, China, and India. In late December 1921, they were in Rome, with plans to travel to the Orient.\n\nWeber and Smalley returned to the United States on April 7, 1922. On June 24, 1922, Weber obtained a divorce secretly from Smalley, who was described as both alcoholic and abusive, but kept him as a friend and companion. Their divorce was made public on January 12, 1923 by the \"Los Angeles Examiner\".\n\nUpon her return to Hollywood, Weber found an \"'industry in transition', evident in the fact that Erich von Stroheim was out of favor, D. W. Griffith was gradually more marginalized, and Rex Ingram, like von Stroheim, could not adapt to production changes demanded by the consolidated studios.\" As Shelley Stamp explains: \"In an age of studio conglomeration and vertical integration, few independents could survive, a reality that hit women particularly hard: both Alice Guy-Blaché and Nell Shipman closed their production companies during this period as well. Will Hays, newly installed at the MPPDA, was also beginning to assert greater control over studio releases.\"\n\nIn November 1922, Weber returned to Universal, where she directed \"A Chapter in Her Life\", based on the 1903 novel \"Jewel: A Chapter in her Life\" by Clara Louise Burnham, and a remake of a 1915 film called \"Jewel\", which she had directed previously with Smalley. \"A Chapter in Her Life\" was part of \"a slate of literary adaptations Universal released that year, headlined by Lon Chaney's \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" and marketed under the tag line \"Great Pictures made from Great Books with Great Exploitation Tieups.\" The film starring Claude Gillingwater was released on September 17, 1923.\n\nHowever, according to Stamp, \"Without a chain of theaters under its control, like emerging studio giants MGM and Paramount, Universal now occupied a significantly different market position than it had during the height of Weber’s career there in the mid- 1910s. With the bulk of urban, first-run theaters closed to Universal, the studio now relied on independent theaters mainly located in small towns and rural areas. Nor was the studio home to the female directing talent it had once been—Weber was now on her own.\" Consequently, Universal's trade ads made a clear pitch to small-town exhibitors, offering them \"quality\" pictures at reasonable prices, providing access to first-run pictures many studios reserved for their large urban venues. \"A Chapter in Her Life\" is available on home video and DVD from Nostalgia.\n\nWhile Weber was praised for her direction in \"A Chapter in Her Life\", \"critics felt the film's subject matter—a young girl whose love and faith transform the troubled adults in her life – was ultimately out of step with the times. \"Film Daily\" dubbed the material 'old fashioned', with other critics objecting to the film's 'Pollyanna' themes.\" Weber subsequently left Universal, vowing not to produce any films for a while, intending to write plays and a novel instead. She traveled to Europe again and spent time at the Colorado summer home of her friend, novelist Margaretta Tuttle, who had written the novel \"Feet of Clay\", later made into a 1924 film by Cecil B. deMille, saying she would remain on vacation until the censors \"came to their senses\".\n\nAt the time, Weber complained of both the control exerted by consolidated studios, as well as the ever more strenuous censorship of the Hays Code: \"I have received many offers, but in each case I'm hampered with too many conditions. ... The producers select the stories, select the cast, tell you how much you can pay for a picture and how long you can have to make it in. All this could be borne. But when they tell you that they also will cut your picture, that is too much.\"\n\nThe trade journal \"Film Mercury\" declared that \"it would be interesting to know why [Weber] has made no films in the past year or so,\" noting that \"it is almost a crime for such wonderful director material to be lying idle while third-raters flood the screen with junk.\" After suffering a nervous collapse in 1923, Weber made no movies until 1925. During this period, when Weber ostensibly \"retired from public life\", it was rumored that Weber had attempted suicide and had entered a mental facility to treat her mental depression.\n\nBy the end of January 1925, Weber announced her engagement to Captain Harry Gantz (born in Deadwood, South Dakota on September 4, 1887; died August 11, 1949 in Cairns, Queensland, Australia), a retired army officer who had served as a second lieutenant in the Philippine Constabulary from 1907–11, then as a second lieutenant in company C of the 23rd Infantry from 1912 to 1915.\n\nIn October 1914, Weber transferred from the 23rd Infantry to the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps, and became a pioneer aviator during the Pancho Villa Expedition, making him an early bird of aviation. On September 1, 1915, Gantz married Beatrice Wooster Miller. At the time of his engagement to Weber, Gantz was a wealthy orange rancher and the owner of the 140 acre El Dorado Ranch, in Fullerton, California. Gantz is credited with bringing Weber \"out of a retirement which was more nearly a despondent withdrawal from public life\". However, Anthony Slide indicates that Gantz was \"something of an opportunist, who persuaded Weber to marry him — and co-incidentally let him manage her considerable fortune.\"\n\nIn January 1925, Weber returned once again to Universal, hired by Carl Laemmle to take charge of all story development for a $5 million production initiative based around the adaptation of popular novels. Universal released one major big budget film each year, including \"The Hunchback of Notre-Dame\" (1923) and \"The Phantom of the Opera\" (1925), both starring Lon Chaney, Sr.. After two unsuccessful previews, in 1925 Weber and Maurice Pivar were assigned to re-edit \"The Phantom of the Opera\" before its ultimate release in September 1925. Another novel which Universal decided to film was \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", for which Weber completed an adaptation for a film to be directed in 1926 by Harry A. Pollard, who had starred as Uncle Tom in a 1913 version, and was, by 1923, Universal's leading director, with nine consecutive hits.\n\nIn 1926, Weber signed a new distribution deal with Universal, making her \"one of the highest paid women in the business\". One of her first \"comeback\" movies was \"The Marriage Clause\", which Weber adapted from the short story \"Technic\" by Dana Burnet in \"The Saturday Evening Post\" of May 16, 1925. It starred Francis X. Bushman and brought contract player Billie Dove to international prominence. It was released on September 12, 1926.\n\nBy June 1926, Weber was signed to direct \"Sensation Seekers\", a romantic drama based on Ernest Pascal's novel \"Egypt\", that also starred Billie Dove. However, just before her wedding, Weber replaced Pollard as director of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", as he had been hospitalized in Manhattan with blood poisoning and a shattered jaw caused by the \"maltreatment\" of a tooth infection by a New York dentist. Weber ceased work on \"Sensation Seekers\" and was willing to interrupt her honeymoon to travel to Louisiana to direct the location scenes for \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\".\n\nOn June 15, the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported Gantz had obtained a license to marry Weber. On June 30, 1926, a justice of the peace married the couple in a ceremony at Enchanted Hill, the home of screenwriter Frances Marion in Santa Ana, California. At their wedding, Weber reduced her age by nine years to 38 to match her new husband. In 1927, Smalley married music teacher Phyllis Lorraine Ephlin.\n\nAfter five months during which his life was in serious jeopardy, and six jaw operations, Pollard emerged from hospital, \"disfigured for life, but undaunted, ready once more to resume his megaphone\", Weber was no longer required for \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\". Weber returned to direct \"Sensation Seekers\", which was released on March 20, 1927.\n\nIn November 1926, Weber joined United Artists to direct a comedy film called \"Topsy and Eva\" based on a popular play of that name written by Catherine Chisholm Cushing, featuring the Duncan Sisters in blackface.\n\nWeber had adapted from the original novel when she was attached to the Universal version of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\". She attempted to make another serious adaptation, but the studio decided that it should be a comedy rather than a drama. After some shooting by Weber, she thought some of the scenes to be shot were insulting to African Americans, including such \"racist humor as a stork dropping a black baby into a trash can\". \"Topsy and Eva\" was reassigned to Del Lord to direct, with some additional scenes by D.W. Griffith.\n\nBy 1927, Weber advised young women to avoid filmmaking careers. In 1927 De Mille Pictures signed Weber to direct her final silent movie, \"The Angel of Broadway\", which featured Leatrice Joy, and released on October 3, 1927.\n\nHowever, the advent of sound technology and the demise of silent movies, coupled with some negative reviews and poor box office receipts, ended her comeback in 1927. For example, \"Variety\" believed \"The Angel of Broadway\" its sentimentality would appeal to the masses, but not to sophisticated urban audiences: \"For New York this title is a dud, but in the hinterland it may well be esteemed box office. Pathe has, in fact, a very good commercial property for the territory west of Hoboken\".\n\nBy February 1927, Weber owned and operated Lois Weber's Garden Village at 4633 Santa Monica Boulevard in Los Angeles. In the late 1920s, Weber and Gantz sub-divided the El Rancho Ranch, creating the upscale \"Brookdale Heights\", now at West Brookfield Place, Fullerton, with the 300–400 residential lots advertised for $1,500 to $3,000 each, and houses priced at $8,000 to $9,000 each. On another part of their acreage, the Gantzes built a Spanish-style residence with a tower retreat for Weber at 225 W. Union Street.\n\nWhen Weber was asked in April 1928 when she might direct again, she replied, \"When I find a producer who thinks I have intelligence enough to be let alone and go ahead with my own unit.\" Five years elapsed before Weber got the opportunity again. While Weber and Gantz appeared to be enjoying domestic harmony in March 1930, soon after Weber was separated from Gantz and was living with her mother and nephew in Los Angeles. In 1931, Gantz sold the El Dorado ranch to C. Stanley Chapman, the son of Charles C. Chapman. By 1932, Weber was still separated from Gantz and was managing an apartment building in Fullerton, California.\n\nIn February 1932, Universal released a condensed version of \"Shoes\" called \"The Unshod Maiden\", complete with satirical narration.\n\nThrough the intervention of Frances Marion, by early June 1932 Weber was hired by United Artists as a script doctor, to work on \"Cynara\" with Marion.\n\nIn February 1933, Universal signed Weber to scout for new talent and to direct screen tests. Within weeks, Weber had interviewed 250 girls and young women from dramatic schools.\n\nIn 1933, Universal offered Weber another directing contract, assigning her to Edna Ferber's \"Glamour\", but she was removed from the project abruptly and it was transferred to a reluctant William Wyler.\n\nWeber and Gantz spent five weeks on location in Kauai, Hawaii from August 24, 1933, as she had been hired by the Seven Seas Corporation to direct Virginia Cherrill, then the fiancée of Cary Grant, and Mona Maris in \"Cane Fire\", a tale of racial prejudice and miscegenation on a Hawaiian sugar plantation. Made on a low budget on the plantations of the Kekaha Sugar Company and the Waimea Sugar Company and at Alexander McBryde's Lawai Kai estate, it was the first film shot on the island of Kauai, and was released as \"White Heat\" by the Pinnacle Production Company on June 15, 1934, to limited \"commercial and critical success\", with Weber quoted as saying at the time that the film \"was not a hit but will not lose any money\".\n\n\"White Heat\" proved to be her final film, and her only talkie. It was first shown on television on Friday, June 21, 1940 on NBC's station W2XBS, but is now considered a lost film.\n\nWeber and Gantz divorced about 1935.\n\nIn November 1939, Weber was admitted to Good Samaritan Hospital in critical condition, suffering from a stomach ailment that had afflicted her for years. Almost two weeks later, she died on Monday, November 13, 1939, destitute, from a bleeding ulcer. She was 60 years old. Her younger sister, Ethel Howland, and friends, Frances Marion and Veda Terry, were at her bedside.\n\nHer death was largely overlooked, with her \"Variety\" obituary only two brief paragraphs long, and a brief mention in the \"Los Angeles Examiner\". Gossip columnist Hedda Hopper contributed a more substantial tribute in \"The Los Angeles Times\".\n\nOn Friday, November 17, 1939, more than 300 people attended Weber's funeral, which was paid for by Frances Marion. After the funeral, Weber was cremated at the Los Angeles Crematory and the location of her remains are unknown.\n\nWeber wrote a memoir, \"The End of the Circle\", which was to have been published shortly before her death, but ultimately was not, despite the efforts of her sister, Ethel Howland, and was later stolen in the 1970s. For her contribution to the motion picture industry, on February 8, 1960, Weber was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6518 Hollywood Blvd.\n\nThe Buffalo Dreams Fantastic Film Festival gives out the Lois Weber Award in her honor since 2017.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1707613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1707613", "title": "Lord Chamberlain's Office", "text": "Lord Chamberlain's Office\n\nThe Lord Chamberlain's Office is a department within the British Royal Household. It is concerned with matters such as protocol, state visits, investitures, garden parties, the State Opening of Parliament, royal weddings and funerals. For example, in April 2005 it organised the wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla Parker Bowles. It is also responsible for authorising use of the Royal Arms.\n\nAs the Lord Chamberlain is a part-time position the day-to-day work of the Office is conducted by the Comptroller of the Lord Chamberlain's Office.\n\n\nThe Lord Chamberlain's Office had a more significant role in British society prior to 1968, as it was the official censor for virtually all theatre performed in Britain. Commercial theatre owners were generally satisfied by the safety this arrangement gave them; so long as they presented only licensed plays they were effectively immune from prosecution for any offence a play might cause. There were campaigns by playwrights, however, in opposition to the Lord Chamberlain's censorship, such as those involving J. M. Barrie in 1909 and 1911. Some plays were not licensed in the 1930s, during the period of appeasement, because they were critical of the German Nazi regime and it was feared that allowing certain plays to be performed might alienate what was still thought of as a friendly government. Lord Cromer, then Lord Chamberlain, regularly consulted the Foreign Office and sometimes, the German Embassy. In the latter case, the submissions were intended to be read by a \"friendly German\".\n\nBy the 1960s, there were many playwrights and producers who wished to produce controversial works such as \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\". Theatre companies such as the Royal Court Theatre came into open conflict with the Lord Chamberlain's Office. Sometimes they would resort to such measures as declaring themselves private clubs for the performance of certain plays. The Lord Chamberlain's Office technically had jurisdiction over private performances, but had generally avoided getting involved with bona-fide private clubs. The various activist groups did not actually come up with solid legal loopholes, but the publicity they generated eventually resulted in the abolition of the role of official censor in the Theatres Act 1968.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21159524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21159524", "title": "Marinko Sudac Collection", "text": "Marinko Sudac Collection\n\nThe Marinko Sudac Collection, based in Zagreb, Croatia, has been created with a clear collecting strategy based on the region of Central and Eastern Europe, additionally spanning from the Baltic area to the Black Sea. The guiding principle of the Collection is systematic exploration, researching, and promotion of the avant-garde practices which have been marginalized, forbidden, and at times completely negated due to the historical, social and political circumstances. In this context, the Marinko Sudac Collection gives the most complete and comprehensive overview on the art of this region. The Collection starts at 1909, and it show the continuity from the first Avant-Gardes, through neo-avant-garde and New Artistic Practices, ending with the fall of the Berlin Wall. The global uniqueness of the Marinko Sudac Collection is also seen in the kind of media it contains. It contains not only traditional artworks, such as paintings, sculptures, and photographs, but it gives equal importance to documentary and archival material. Great importance is put on these almost forgotten media, which enable research of specific phenomena, artists and the socio-political situation which affected this type of art. The Collection contains a great number of museological units, and it treats the documentary and archival material on the same level as traditional artworks. By examining the units contained in the Marinko Sudac Collection, one can read not only the art scene or the art production of a certain artist, but the full status of the society, the socio-political atmosphere of the region in which this art was created in.\n\nThis Collection is not merely a process of gathering artworks, but a contextualisation of the art of region in the global history of art and an effort of putting it on its deserved place in history. The aim of the Marinko Sudac Collection is to preserve the cultural heritage of the Central and Eastern European region from globalisation, by maintaining it in a contextual unity. The end goal is to place the Collection in an architectural, physical building of the Museum of Avant-Garde, in which this art will be valorised, museologically processed, open to researchers and experts, and presented to the public. A part of the works from the Marinko Sudac Collection is available in digital form on an innovative platform of the Virtual Museum of Avant-Garde (www.avantgarde-museum.com/en), which unites the work of the Virtual Museum of the Avant-Garde, the Marinko Sudac Collection, and the Institute for the Research of the Avant-Garde, with a goal to form a central database for the researching of the phenomena of the Avant-Garde.\n\nAlongside more than 80 already accomplished successful collaborations with museum institutions and independently organized exhibition in great museum centres such as Tate Modern, London; Ludwig Museum, Budapest, Haus der Kunst, Munich; ZKM, Karlsruhe, Deutsches Filmmuseum Frankfurt, Museum of Modern Art, Warsaw, Museum of Contemporary Art, Zagreb... or exhibition of the Collection in unofficial places such as Marshall Josip Broz Tito's boat \"Seagull\" (\"At Standstill\" exhibition, Rijeka, 2011), Marinko Sudac is also an editor of numerous publications – art monographs, exhibition catalogues and collections of texts, and an author of a successful artist residence project \"Artist on Vacation,\" held annually since 2012, which hosted over 50 of the leading world artists which continue the tradition of the Avant-Garde.\n\nThe Collection's interest extends from the Baltic area to the Black Sea, with particular emphasis on Central and Eastern Europe. The collector's strategy is directed towards systematic exploration, research, and promotion of Avant-Garde practices that have been marginalized, forbidden, and at times completely rejected, due to historical, social and political circumstances. In this respect, the Collection is, in relation to already existing European art collections, regionally cohesive, and presents an inexhaustible resource for the research of Avant-Garde art and a dynamic platform for the exchange of knowledge on the phenomenon of Avant-Garde. This can be seen in numerous topical and retrospective exhibitions, organized events, followed by connected detailed publications or studies, articles in professional journals, some published in the framework of research projects and collaborations with numerous important institutions, experts, theoreticians, art historians, and artists from the entire world.\n\nThe Virtual Museum of Avant-Garde, based on the Marinko Sudac Collection, was created in 2009. It presents the digital database of the Collection through which you can see the overview of Avant-Garde art in the countries of former Yugoslavia structured according to authors, artworks, time periods, and geographical areas, as well as links and influences of the artists with cultural happenings and artistic centres in the region and the world. The website, beside the high-quality digitized artworks, contains biographies and bibliographies, alongside the connection of the artists with other artists, art institutions and cultural forums, as well as selected publications.\n\nThe online database show only a small part of the Collection. Speedy digitization of the material is crucial to accomplish the Museum's main aim, which is to make it a centre for information on the regional Avant-Garde practices.\n\nThe Virtual Museum of Avant-Garde is a free online platform to research all forms of Avant-Garde art of Eastern and Central Europe, to show connection with the rest of the world, to be a place for free thought and making realisations on the relevant cultural phenomena of Avant-Garde thought and artistic doing, to be a space for creating and publishing expert materials and research on the phenomena of the Avant-Garde. In its work, the Virtual Museum of Avant-Garde managed to become a meeting point of experts and intellectuals from the region and the artists, as well as interested public who can, in one place, find many information on the Avant-Garde movement in this area.\n\nThe international Board is made up of leading theoreticians and art historians: Lutz Becker, Jerko Denegri, Živko Grozdanić, Matko Meštrović, Želimir Koščević, Irina Subotić, Feđa Vukić, and Laszlo Beke. The director is Branko Franceschi.\n\nSince its beginning, the Marinko Sudac Collection has been open to collaboration with various institutions. Through the years, the works from the Collection have been exhibited both locally and internationally.\n\nThe Collection has been recognised as a good partner and the growing interest in different types of collaborations (exhibitions, conferences, projects, movies, publications) shows the quality of the Collections and its open character.\n\n\nList of collaborations with instititutions (loans of works from the Marinko Sudac Collection)\n\n\n\nAs part of its activities, the interconnected institutions of the Museum of Avant-Garde, Marinko Sudac Collection, and the Institute for the Research of the Avant-Garde publish various types of publications – artist monographies, exhibition catalogues etc.\n\nThe aim of these publishing projects is to present relevant artists, artist groups, artistic movements and developments of the former Yugoslavia region, as well as of Eastern and Central Europe. By presenting them through publications, the aim is to provide them with better international recognition and valorisations, so they could be placed in their rightful position in the global art scene.\n\n\n\n\nThe Institute for the Research of the Avant-Garde was created in 2010 as part of the project which has as its goal to research, preserve, present and popularize regional historical Avant-Gardes. The Institute brings together the work of the Virtual Museum of Avant-Garde and the Marinko Sudac Collection. The Institute for the Research of the Avant-Garde's task is to create the work and development strategy of the Museum of Avant-Garde, make projects which promote Avant-Garde art and publish materials on the topic.\n\nSince 2012, the Artist on Vacation project has gathered, hosted and presented to the public a number of internationally prestigious artists who belong to the period of historical Avant-gardes, as well as artists who continue the practice of radical art and further develop its aesthetics. In the summer months, Poreč becomes a vacation spot for international artists. In collaboration with Valamar Riviera d.d., the Institute for the Research of Avant-Garde and Marinko Sudac Collection invite artists to spend a week at an exclusive hotel and vacation on the beautiful Istrian peninsula.\n\nThe project was created by Marinko Sudac as an extension of the activities of the Museum of Avant-Garde, the Institute for the Research of Avant-Garde and Marinko Sudac Collection. It complements the Collection's mission, and gives affirmation to the artists in the social, cultural and artistic contexts. The mission of the Artists on Vacation project is to show the various legacies of the original Avant-Garde movement that have developed in different countries and contexts.\n\nThe entire driving force behind our project is to present the participating artists to the Croatian public. The project is an effort to connect all the activities that aim to bring together the historical Avant-Gardes and present them to the public in a direct way, outside of an institutional environment. Artists get an opportunity to meet other artists, but also theorists, art historians, and museum professionals. This exchange of ideas and influences brings about personal and artistic developments and paves way to new collaborations and projects. Every year, there is an exclusive one day exhibition organized during the Project.\n\nEach year, at the end of the Project, an exhibition of works created during the Artist on Vacation project, as well as a presentation of the participating artists is organized at the Museum of Contemporary Art Zagreb. A catalogue of a year's project is produced. The catalogue contains all the information about the project, the participating artists, their stay at Poreč, their works etc.\n\nEvery year, there is an exclusive one day exhibition organized during the Project.\n\nIn 2012: Attila Csernik (Serbia), Era Milivojević (Serbia), Radomir Damnjanović Damnjan (Italy), Ilija Šoškić (Italy), Ivan Kožarić (Croatia), János Sugár (Hungary), Vlado Martek (Croatia), Sándor Pinczehelyi (Hungary), Bálint Szombathy (Hungary), Romelo Pervolovici (Romania), Željko Kipke (Croatia).\n\nIn 2013: Željko Kipke (Croatia), Dan Perjovschi (Romania), Rudolf Sikora (Slovakia), Zdzisław Sosnowski (Poland), Blue Noses – Alexandr Shaburov and Vyacheslav Mizin (Russia), Oleg Kulik (Russia), Eric Andersen (Denmark), Marko Pogačnik (Slovenia), Živko Grozdanić (Serbia), Bálint Szombathy (Hungary), Ben Patterson (USA).\n\nIn 2014: Dragomir Ugren (Serbia), Gergelj Urkom (Serbia), Ulay (Germany), Era Milivojević (Serbia), Andraž Šalamun (Slovenia), David Nez (USA), Jiří Valoch (Czech Republic), Sven Stilinović (Croatia), Igor Grubić (Croatia).\n\nIn 2015: Verbumprogram (Serbia), Autopsia (Czech Republic), Teresa Tyszkiewicz (France), Ewa Partum (Poland), Przemysław Kwiek (Poland), Guia Rigvava (Austria), Jan Steklik (Czech Republic), Michail Grobman (Israel), Vadim Fiskin (Slovenia), Deimantas Narkevičius (Lithuania), Miloš Šejn (Czech Republic), Srečo Dragan (Slovenia), Milan Adamčiak (Slovakia).\n\nIn 2016: István Nádler (Hungary), Katalin Ladik (Hungary), Raša Todosijević (Serbia), Lev Nussberg (Russia), Philip Corner (USA), Rudolf Sikora (Slovakia), Slobodan Šijan (Serbia), Jarosław Kozłowski (Poland),Vladimir Gudac (Croatia)\n\nIn 2017: Ken Friedman (USA / Sweden), Miroslav Pavlović (Serbia), Zoran Todorović (Serbia), Andrien Sina (France), Nikola Džafo (Serbia), Tanja Ostojić (Serbia / Germany), Koji Kamoji (Japan / Poland), Józef Robakowski (Poland), Jusuf Hadžifejzović (Bosnia and Hercegovina), Boris Buden (Croatia)\n\nDocumentary film \"Artist on Vacation\" follows the activities of 11 world-renowned artists who have gathered in a luxurious Adriatic resort for a one-month vacation.

The NESW name makes a symbolic reference to the cardinal directions in allusion to the idea of boundless exploration.\n\nThe North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop was founded in 2002, with sculptors Mark Bellows, Andrew French, and Ryan McCourt as the resident artists. In its first year, the NESW produced four exhibitions in four different venues: \"\"Front Room Sculpture\" at Harcourt House; \"North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop\" at Global Visions Film Festival; \"Desperate Measures\" with The Works Society; and \"Big Things\"\" at the Royal Alberta Museum.\n\nSculptures by the North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop artists appeared in another 2002 Harcourt House exhibition: \"Edmonton Sculpture: The Next Generation\", an Edmonton sculpture survey show curated by Canadian artist, curator and critic Terry Fenton. In his accompanying essay, Fenton singles out the NESW artists:\n\n\"Andrew French, Mark Bellows, and Ryan McCourt share a studio, giving them the double advantage of being removed from the student environment while retaining continued access to one another for stimulation and criticism. This does not amount to their charting a common course. If anything, the shared studio has confirmed them in separate directions: the hothouse atmosphere appears to have stimulated both invention and individuality. Their work seems to be getting closer to the source of their inspiration, French's into the occupation of space by brute force, Bellows into a poetry of volume, McCourt into elegant profiles\".\nThe success of the North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop's first Big Things exhibition would lead to three more presentations in the series: Big Things 2 in 2003, Big Things 3 in 2004, and Big Things 4 in 2006. In 2005, in celebration of Alberta's centennial year, and the Museum's new Royal Charter from Queen Elizabeth II, the North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop presented the Alberta Centennial Sculpture Exhibition at the newly named Royal Alberta Museum.\n\nMark Bellows left the studio in 2005, while Robert Willms joined the NESW that same year. In 2007, the North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop moved into a large new facility, with 2100 square feet working space, concrete floors, 20-foot ceilings, and a 2,800-square-foot yard. As the Royal Alberta Museum grounds were unavailable to the group that year, the NESW exhibited \"New Directions,\" a show of smaller works, at the Stollery Gallery in Edmonton.\nUpon touring the North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop in 2008, Edmonton arts writer Amy Fung called the studio \"\"essentially an artist’s wet dream in our space-deprived city.\" In her view, the NESW was \"certainly more impressive in size and facilities than existing local ARCs and arts initiatives such as ArtsHabitat\"\". In 2008, the North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop presented \"AUTOGRAPH: Sculpture and Drawing by Rob Willms\", the inaugural exhibition in Common Sense, their new gallery space; and \"Peter Hide @ The RAM,\" an exhibition of major works by Hide on the Royal Alberta Museum's outdoor sculpture patio.\n\nAccording to a 2012 Edmonton Journal profile on the NESW, their ground level studio at 10546 - 115th street has 2100 square feet of concrete floor space, 20-foot-high ceilings, and a ten-foot by fourteen-foot sliding door that leads to a 2800-square-foot storage yard. Resident sculptors in 2012 include Ryan McCourt, Mark Bellows, Andrew French, Stephen Pardy and Robert Willms. From 2008 to 2012, the NESW gallery Common Sense held twenty-nine exhibitions of artists from around the world working in a variety of media. The North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop formerly ran a widely read blog called Studiosavant, which discussed the Edmonton art scene.\n"}
{"id": "24812261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24812261", "title": "Oration on the Dignity of Man", "text": "Oration on the Dignity of Man\n\nThe Oration on the Dignity of Man (\"De hominis dignitate\") is a famous public discourse composed in 1486 by Pico della Mirandola, an Italian scholar and philosopher of the Renaissance. It remained unpublished until 1496. The \"Pico Project,\" a collaboration between University of Bologna, Italy, and Brown University, United States, dedicated to the \"Oration\", and others have called it the \"Manifesto of the Renaissance\".\n\nPico, who belonged to the family that had long dwelt in the Castle of Mirandola, left his share of the ancestral principality to his two brothers to devote himself wholly to study. In his fourteenth year, 1477, he went to Bologna accompanied by his mother to study canon law and fit himself for the ecclesiastical career. Following his mother's death in 1478, Pico in 1479 requested from the Marquess of Mantua a free passage to Ferrara, where he would devote himself to the study of philosophy and theology. He spent the following seven years variously in Ferrara, Padua, Florence and Paris, studying Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Syriac, and Arabic at the chief universities of Italy and France.\n\nPico's \"Oration\" attempted to remap the human landscape to center all attention on human capacity and human perspective. Arriving in a place near Florence, he taught the amazing capacity of human achievement. \"Pico himself had a massive intellect and studied everything there was to be studied in the university curriculum of the Renaissance; the \"Oration\" in part is meant to be a preface to a massive compendium of all the intellectual achievements of humanity, a compendium that never appeared because of Pico's early death.\"\n\nPico della Mirandola intended to speak in front of an invited audience of scholars and clerics of the dignity of the liberal arts and about the glory of angels. Of these angels he spoke of three divisions in particular: the Seraphim, Cherubim, and Thrones. These are the highest three choirs in the angel hierarchy, each one embodying a different virtue. The Seraphim represent charity, and in order to obtain the status of Seraphim, Mirandola declares that one must \"burn with love for the Creator\". The Cherubim represent intelligence. This status is obtained through contemplation and meditation. Finally, Thrones represent justice, and this is obtained by being just in ruling over \"inferior things\". Of these three, the Thrones is the lowest, Cherubim the middle, and Seraphim the highest. In this speech, Mirandola emphasizes the Cherubim and that by embodying the values of the Cherub, one can be equally prepared for \"the fire of the Seraphim and the judgement of the Thrones\". This deviation into the hierarchy of angels makes sense when Pico della Mirandola makes his point that a philosopher \"is a creature of Heaven and not of earth\" because they are capable of obtaining any one of the statuses.\n\nIn the \"Oration\", Pico justified the importance of the human quest for knowledge within a Neoplatonic framework. He writes that after God had created all creatures, He conceived of the desire for another sentient being who would appreciate all His works, but there was no longer any room in the chain of being; all the possible slots from angels to worms had been filled. So, God created man such that he had no specific slot in the chain. Instead, men were capable of learning from and imitating any existing creature. When man philosophizes, he ascends the chain of being towards the angels, and communion with God. When he fails to exercise his intellect, he vegetates. Pico did not fail to notice that this system made philosophers like himself among the most dignified human creatures.\n\nThe idea that men could ascend the chain of being through the exercise of their intellectual capacities was a profound endorsement of the dignity of human existence in this earthly life. The root of this dignity lay in his assertion that only human beings could change themselves through their own free will, whereas all other changes in nature were the result of some outside force acting on whatever it is that undergoes change. He observed from history that philosophies and institutions were always in change, making man's capacity for self-transformation the only constant. Coupled with his belief that all of creation constitutes a symbolic reflection of the divinity of God, Pico's philosophies had a profound influence on the arts, helping to elevate writers and painters from their medieval role as mere artisans to the Renaissance ideal of the artist as genius.\n\nThe \"Oration\" also served as an introduction to Pico's 900 theses, which he believed to provide a complete and sufficient basis for the discovery of all knowledge, and hence a model for mankind's ascent of the chain of being. The 900 Theses are a good example of humanist syncretism, because Pico combined Platonism, Neoplatonism, Aristotelianism, Hermeticism and Kabbalah. They also included 72 theses describing what Pico believed to be a complete system of physics. Pico also argued in this oration that his youth should not discredit any of the content of his 900 theses (he was in his twenties).\n\nPico had \"cosmic ambitions\": in his letters and early texts, he hinted that debate of the 900 theses (the first printed book ever universally banned by the Church) might trigger Christ's Second Coming and the end of the world.. Innocent VIII condemned the theses in general but declared the author to be free from censure. This was written in August 5, 1487 but it was not issued until the following December. In a letter to Lorenzo dated August 27, 1489, Pico affirms among other things some of his thesis refer purely to profane matters and were never intended for general reading, but for private debate among the learned.\n\nIn the \"Oration\" he writes that \"human vocation is a mystical vocation that has to be realized following a three stage way, which comprehends necessarily moral transformation, intellectual research and final perfection in the identity with the absolute reality. This paradigm is universal, because it can be retraced in every tradition.\"\n\nHere Pico explains why he chose to become a philosopher. A paraphrase of paragraph 24:\nThese are the reasons why I decided to study philosophy. And I'm not going to explain them to anyone except those who condemn philosophy. Philosophy is not something to be used scornfully or as insult, but for honor and glory. People are beginning to think wrongly in that philosophy should only be studied by very few, if any at all, as if it is something of little worth. We have reduced philosophy to only being useful when being used for profit. I say these things with regret and indignation for the philosophers who say it should not be pursued because it has no value, thus disqualifying themselves as philosophers. Since they are in it for their own personal gain, they miss the truth for its own sake. I'm going to say, not to brag, but I've never philosophized except for the sake of philosophy, and have never desired it for my own cultivation. I have been able to lose myself in philosophy and not be influenced by others who try to pull me away from it. Philosophy has taught me to rely on my own convictions rather than on the judgments of others and to concern myself less with whether I am well thought of than whether what I do or say is evil.\n\nPico was prevented from holding his Oration. It was penned as the opening speech for a public disputation of his 900 theses, planned for early 1487, but Pope Innocent VIII suspended the event and instead set up a commission to examine the theses for heresy. A presentation of the full text in English in front of a live audience read by Sebastian Michael took place at TU Wien (University of Technology Vienna) as part of the opening event of the first Sophistication Conference organised by the Department for Architecture Theory and Philosophy of Technics on 7 December 2017. \n\n"}

On crosses the pendilia may include the letters alpha and omega, and on votive offerings, which were often designed to be hung over altars and where pendilia are at their largest and most spectacular, they may spell out whole words (see illustration).\n\nThe term is commonly used in coin collecting. Pendilia are depicted on coins as jewels or pearls hanging from the sides of the crown, and occur frequently on coins of Byzantine emperors. The pendilia which hung from the Emperors' crowns began with Marcian. Although the years saw the styles of crown change, the pendilia remained, at least through Manuel II Palaiologos.

{"id": "54677717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54677717", "title": "Perseus and Andromeda (Titian)", "text": "Perseus and Andromeda (Titian)\n\nPerseus and Andromeda is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Titian, now in the Wallace Collection in London. It was painted in 1554–56 as part of a series of mythological paintings called \"poesie\" (\"poetry\") intended for King Philip II of Spain. The paintings took subjects from the Roman poet Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\", in this case Book IV, lines 663–752, and all featured female nudes.\n\nThe painting is in oils on canvas, and measures 175 x 189.5 cm. It was probably one already described as \"damaged\" in 1605, and has suffered subsequent damages, as well as apparently being cut down along all the sides. Scientific imaging techniques show an unusually large number of changes as the composition evolved.\n\nThe painting shows the hero Perseus flying through the air in combat to kill the sea monster who has come to kill Andromeda, who has been chained to a cliff by the sea shore for him. Perseus has already attacked and wounded the monster on the shoulder.\n\nThe painting is well-travelled; painted in Venice, it was delivered in modern Belgium, then went to Spain, Italy, England, and France before returning to England.\n\nIn Greek mythology, the kingdom of Ethiopia was ruled by the beautiful but vain queen, Cassiope; she maintained that her beauty, and that of her daughter Andromeda, was superior to that of the sea nymphs, who were the daughters of Poseidon, the god of the sea. When the nymphs became aware of her claims, they protested to their father, who retaliated by calling up a Cetus or sea monster to ravage the coastline of Ethiopia placing Cassiope's kingdom at risk. On the advice of Jupiter Ammon, the Queen, together with her husband Cepheus, decided to sacrifice her daughter Andromeda to the monster. Perseus, flying back from his killing of the gorgon Medusa, kills the monster and rescues Andromeda, whom he then marries.\n\nTitian follows Ovid fairly closely, although it is likely that his Latin was poor, and he mainly relied on somewhat simplified versions in Italian, of which there was a choice. This may explain some of the differences to the Latin original, although Titian may well just have interpreted the story freely. In Ovid Andromeda's parents are nearby; here they are probably on the shore opposite, by a city. Andromeda stands amid seashells and coral. Coral is mentioned by Ovid, but as being formed from Medusa's locks at a later stage in the story. Ovid describes Andromeda as looking like a statue, and having been crying; Titian's depiction matches both. Perseus had been given his curved sword by Mercury, and his shield by Minerva. Like Mercury, he wears winged boots, and also a winged helmet.\n\nVarious visual sources have been suggested, both from the rather crude woodcut illustrations of various editions of Ovid, and specific classical reliefs, as well as a well-known drawing by Michelangelo of the \"Risen Christ\" (British Museum). The book illustrations \"all show Perseus wearing a winged helmet like Mercury, for which there is no textual justification, and carrying a small baroque parade shield, features which Titian may later have remembered.\"\n\nThe first two of the \"poesie\" series were \"Danaë\" and \"Venus and Adonis\", delivered in 1553 and late 1554 respectively. Both of these were repetitions with variations of compositions Titian had already painted in the previous decade for the Farnese family in Rome. In a letter from Titian to Philip accompanying the \"Venus and Adonis\", he noted that the pair offered contrasting poses, and promised \"another different view\" in both \"Perseus and Andromeda\" and a \"Jason and Medea\" he intended to produce. These were to be the first original compositions in the series for Philip, but there is no trace of the \"Jason and Medea\", which was presumably abandoned. Instead \"The Rape of Europa\" is designed as a companion to \"Perseus and Andromeda\".\n\nThe composition of Perseus and Andromeda developed through several stages, which can be traced through x-rays and infra-red reflectography, and a surviving drawing. Some of the earlier elements can still be seen to the naked eye on close examination of the painting. At first Andromeda was on the right, in a fairly similar pose, but leaning from left to right as in the final picture. The arm to the left was raised above her head in a similar fashion, but the other arm more or less horizontal, and the head presumably looking to the centre. There is a drawing by Anthony van Dyck from his Italian sketchbook (now Chatsworth House) recording such a figure, probably copying a lost drawing by Titian, a rarity by this stage in his career.\nWhen Andromeda was moved to the left of the painting her pose was different from the final painting, more similar to the original one when she was on the right. There were several different positions, some taken no further than underdrawing, for Perseus' limbs, sword and shield. The monster originally rose higher out of the water.\n\nIn a dissident view, Rearick sees the Wallace collection canvas as a second version, the original being the one delivered to Philip in 1556, and now lost, with Andromeda on the right. He sees a painting by Paolo Veronese in Rennes as a paraphrase of this version.\n\nA few years later, probably by 1558, Titian painted for Philip's aunt Mary of Hungary a \"St Margaret and the Dragon\" (now Prado) which, with the removal of Perseus, more clothes, and a cross carried by Saint Margaret, shows much the same situation, with a cliff, the sea, and a city across a bay.\n\nPhilip received the painting at Ghent in the Spanish Netherlands in September 1556. In 1574 Titian had still not been paid, according to a list he sent Philip's secretary and favourite Antonio Pérez. It appears to have left the Spanish royal collection before Philip's death in 1598 (the only \"poesie\" to do so), but was replaced by a careful copy, now in Gerona, Spain. It may have been given to Pérez, as other important paintings were. This would have been before his drastic fall from favour in 1579.\n\nAlternatively it may have been given to the family of the court sculptors Leone Leoni and his son Pompeo, also given paintings by Philip. The Leoni family may have bought it when the collections of Pérez were dispersed. There are records of paintings of the subject in the collections of Pérez in 1585–86 (described as \"grande\" or large), of Leon Bautista Leoni on his death in 1605 (\"a damaged Andromeda by Titian\") and of his father Pompeo Leoni on his death in 1608 (described as large, and by Titian). All of these may refer to this painting, but this is not certain.\n\nThe painting was certainly in the collection of Anthony van Dyck, who may have acquired it from the Leoni family, who were based in Milan, during his years in Italy from 1621 to 1627. It was listed among his paintings on his death in London in 1641, and bought in 1646 by one of van Dyck's best customers, Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland, together with Titian's \"Portrait of the Vendramin Family\" (now National Gallery). Northumberland paid £200 for the pair, and a further £80 in 1656. However, it does not seem to have been owned by Northumberland for long, and was in France by 1654, and possibly by 1649. In 1654 it was in the Paris house of the politician Louis Phélypeaux, seigneur de La Vrillière, where it remained until 1717, sold with the house in 1705.\n\nIt then joined the famous Orleans Collection of Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, Regent of France, to be re-united with four others of Titian's \"poesie\", and two other versions by Titian of \"Venus and Adonis\". By this time only Philip's versions of that and \"Danaë\" remained in the Spanish royal collection, and are now in the Prado. Like most of the rest of the Orleans Italian paintings, it moved to London where the collection was dispersed after the French Revolution in a complicated series of transactions, in some of which it was wrongly described as formerly in the collection of Charles I of England. In 1798 it was valued at 700 guineas but failed to sell, selling for 310 gn. in 1800, and £362 in 1815. This was much less than the £2,500 gn the Duke of Bridgewater, one of the syndicate handling the sales, paid for each of \"Diana and Actaeon\" and \"Diana and Callisto\", other \"poesie\".\n\nThe 1815 sale was the last time the painting came to the market. It was bought by the Earl of Yarmouth, from 1822 Francis Seymour-Conway, 3rd Marquess of Hertford, father of the 4th Marquess, the main collector forming the Wallace Collection. The 3rd Marquess contributed relatively few pictures to the Wallace Collection, and those were mostly portraits.\n\nThe painting was initially not regarded as one of the stars of the collection. Between 1842 and about 1854 it was stored in the Pantechnicon repository in London, before moving to Hertford House, now home of the Wallace Collection, where it has remained. An 1870 inventory records it in the \"Lumber Room\" there, described as by Domenichino, and Ingamells notes disapprovingly that \"between 1876 and 1897 [it] hung unglazed over a bath in Sir Richard Wallace's dressing room\", before being correctly identified and rescued from the steam.\n\nThe painting was not copied by Titian or his workshop, as the first two \"poesie\" were, but later copies exist. When Philip II gave the painting away, a copy was made for the Spanish royal collection, which in 1882 was sent to the museum in Gerona, Spain. The Hermitage Museum has a copy that probably once belonged to Prince Eugene of Savoy. The Musée Ingres in Montauban, France has a 17th-century copy once in the Palace of Versailles, where it was recorded in 1683.\n\nAn engraving by the Venetian Ferrando Bertelli probably dates to the 1550s and is a close rendering, though extending the composition on all sides except the left, possibly reflecting the original size of the painting, which has been cut down to an unknown extent. Giovanni Battista Fontana (1524–1587) produced two prints, one dated 1564 and not very similar, the other closer to the Titian and undated. Neither are exactly reproductions. Illustrations to Ovid from the late 16th century on often adopt aspects, or the general layout of the painting, without being copies. The many paintings of the subject in later centuries tended to follow Titian's reduction of the subject to the two main figures and the monster, although not copying his composition. The subject became especially popular in the 19th century.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2569394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2569394", "title": "Quartering (heraldry)", "text": "Quartering (heraldry)\n\nQuartering in is a method of joining several different coats of arms together in one shield by dividing the shield into equal parts and placing different coats of arms in each division.\n\nHowever, in most traditions there is no limit on the number of divisions allowed, and the records of the College of Arms include a shield of 323 quarterings for the family of Lloyd of Stockton. These 323 quarterings include numerous repeated attributed arms assigned to Welsh chieftains from the 9th century or earlier.\n\nAnother example of a shield of many quarterings is the coat of arms of the Powys-Lybbe family, which contains 64 quarterings. Different rules apply in Scottish heraldry, and may well apply in other jurisdictions like Canada and South Africa.\n\nThe arms of the Queen of the United Kingdom are arms of dominion, which join together the arms of the ex-kingdoms now part of her kingdom. However, the vast majority of quarterly coats of arms display arms which are claimed by descent: in other words, they join together coats of arms of the ancestors of the bearer of the arms.\n\nStrict rules apply, both as to what arms may be displayed by way of quarterings, and the order in which they may be displayed. Men and women are always entitled to display the arms of their paternal line but are not usually entitled to display by way of quartering the arms of families from whom there is descent only through a female line (for example, the arms of a mother or grandmother or great-grandmother). An exception is made, however, if the female who breaks the male line of descent is a heraldic heiress—a woman who has no brothers, or whose brothers have died without issue. Such a woman is entitled to transmit her father's arms to her own children, who add them as a quartering. If her father was himself entitled to one or more quarterings, these will pass to his daughters' children as quarterings as well. Quarterings are displayed in the order in which they are acquired by a family by marriage, starting with those acquired by the earliest marriage to bring in quarterings. It is permissible to omit quarterings, but if a quartering was brought in by a later quartering, it is essential to show the whole chain of quarterings leading to the quartering displayed, or else to omit the chain altogether.\n\nThe larger the number of quarterings, the smaller the space available for each coat of arms, so that most families entitled to many quarterings make a selection of those they ordinarily use. The Duke of Norfolk, for example, uses only four quarterings, although he is entitled to many more. In Scotland in some cases the plain unquartered coat is the more prized, as entitlement to its use can indicate who is chief of the name and arms and holds the headship of a clan. For example, Flora Fraser, Lady Saltoun of Abernethy has arms as chief of Fraser—the plain coat of 'azure, three fraises argent'—and a 'private' quartered coat. The Powys-Lybbe family appear, likewise, to usually use only the quarterings of Powys and Lybbe. However these are not true quarterings as the arms were changed in 1907 to be an impartible design of the two arms; the personal arms are precisely this design, with no quarterings despite its appearance. (If this were a quartering the following would apply: when only two different coats of arms are shown, each one is repeated twice in order to fill up the minimum number of four quarterings on such a display.) Prior to the 1907 change, the family did quarter their arms with Lybbe but with the Powys arms in the top left quarter as these were the family arms; the new design has Lybbe in the top left as Lybbe is the last part of the name.\n\n"}

{"id": "38332122", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38332122", "title": "Russian Symphony Orchestra Society", "text": "Russian Symphony Orchestra Society\n\nThe Russian Symphony Orchestra Society (also known simply as the Russian Symphony Orchestra) was founded in in New York City by Modest Altschuler, and functioned for fifteen years.\n\nOscar Levant described the orchestra as having constituted \"a school for concertmasters\"; among its members were Frederic Fradkin (concertmaster of the Boston Symphony), Maximilian Pilzer (concertmaster of the New York Philharmonic), Ilya Skolnik (concertmaster of the Detroit Symphony), and Louis Edlin (concertmaster of the National Orchestral Association). Film music conductors Nikolai Sokoloff, Nathaniel Shilkret and Nat Finston were also Russian Symphony Orchestra alumni, as was trumpeter Harry Glantz. The orchestra also formed the backbone of the New Music Society of America, founded in December 1905.\n\nThey performed the New York premieres of numerous pieces by Sergei Rachmaninoff, Igor Stravinsky and Alexander Scriabin, including Stravinsky's first symphony (the Symphony in E-flat) and \"The Firebird\".\n\nThe orchestra's debut public performance was at Cooper Union Hall on January 7, 1904, and, according to Leonard Slatkin, featured works by Mikhail Glinka, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Henryk Wieniawski, and the American premiere of Rachmaninoff's \"The Rock\". However, the \"New York Times\" of January 3, 1904 lists the program as consisting of the Overture from Glinka's \"Ruslan and Lyudmila\", a baritone aria from Borodin's \"Prince Igor\", an \"intermezzo\" from Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov, a Russian dance by Eduard Nápravník and the symphonic suite \"Scheherazade\" by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov; The \"Times\" of January 24 that same year mentions their second concert as including Wieniawski's \"Souvenir de Moscou\" and reviewing a later concert in the series mentions a performance of \"'The Cliff' by Rachmaninoff,\" presumably the same piece as \"The Rock\".\n\nFor the 1904–1905 season, the orchestra, now expanded to 85 musicians, performed six concerts at Carnegie Hall, featuring a works by a broad range of Russian composers, including a violin concerto by Julius Conus. The \"Times\" summarized the season as \"resplendent with novelties,\" and praised their \"enthusiasm\" and the \"absorbing interest\" of their selected material, but was critical of the technical quality of their performances, particularly in comparison with their initial series of concerts at Cooper Union. That season, they were the first to use a celesta in concert performance in the United States. Among many Russian pieces given their American premieres that season was Rimsky-Korsakov's \"The Tale of Tsar Saltan\"; the fourth concert of the season consisted entirely of works that had never before been presented in New York: Vasily Kalinnikov's first symphony, Anton Arensky's suite \"Silhouettes\", and excerpts from Modest Mussorgsky's opera \"Khovanshchina\".\n\nThe next year, their six Saturday night concerts at Carnegie Hall were supplemented by three \"popular price\" concerts there on Sunday afternoons. The orchestra formed a relationship with Vasily Safonov. Rachmininoff was engaged as a guest conductor and piano soloist for concerts of his music performed on April 7–8, 1906, and Safonov's former pupil, pianist Joseph Lhévinne, was brought over to make his American debut; both were in their early thirties at the time, as was composer Vasily Zolotarev, whose \"Rhapsodie Hébraïque\" was also performed that season at Safonov's suggestion. \"Rhapsodie hébraïque\", presented on the last two days of 1905, was based on secular Jewish melodies that the \"Times\" characterized as \"the musical equivalent of Yiddish.\" Pianist Raoul Pugno also participated in the season as a soloist, playing Rachmaninoff's second piano concerto. Now expanded to 90 musicians, the orchestra was becoming an increasingly professional affair with, as the \"Times\" put it, \"soloists of the first rank.\"\n\nAnother of those soloists was Giuseppe Campanari, a baritone associated with the Metropolitan Opera. The chaos of the Revolution of 1905 prevented sending scores from Russia for the orchestra to accompany Campanari on arias from Tchaikovsky's \"Iolanta\" and \"Queen of Spades\" (\"Pique Dame\"), and the performances were almost canceled. The only known copy of even the texts of the arias that could readily be found in New York was a German translation. The situation was finally rescued by \"a little music store on Canal Street\" which had held the relevant scores in stock, unsold for about a decade after they had been purchased from a Russian tenor in need of cash.\n\nPianist Josef Lhévinne likewise had an extremely difficult time escaping the turmoil of revolution in Moscow to come to New York to play with the Russian Symphony and others, facing danger from both the revolutionists and the government. Although his troubles were compounded by an injury to a finger, his January 27, 1906 performance featured Anton Rubinstein's Fifth Concerto, and drew a very favorably review from the \"Times\".\nIn late December 1905, Altschuler and others announced the formation of the New Music Society of America, soliciting \"serious new work\" from American composers, with the Russian Symphony functioning as the group's orchestra. A first Carnegie Hall concert originally scheduled for February 19 apparently never occurred, because the \"New York Times\" refers to a March 10 concert as the group's first; another concert took place April 2, 1906. The most prominent pieces at that first concert Edward MacDowell's \"Indian Suite\" and \"Second Concerto\" (hardly \"new\": although only in his forties, MacDowell was already in his final illness at the time); the orchestra also performed Henry F. Gilbert's \"Salammbô's Invocation to Tänith\" and Arthur Shepard's \"Overture Joyeuse\". The second concert featured violinist Maud Powell as a soloist; works included George Whitefield Chadwick's \"Melpomene\" overture, the premiere of a violin concerto by Henry Holden Huss, and premieres of pieces by David Stanley Smith and Frederick Converse.\n\nThat season, the March 17, 1906 concert featured the first American performance of the young Reinhold Glière's \"Symphony No 1 in E-flat major, Op. 8\" (composed 1900) as well as American premieres of pieces by César Cui a Cossack dance by Alexander Serov, who had died 35 years earlier in an era when Russian music had little currency in America, and 'a new concerto for violin, by Mlinarski,\" presumably the \"Concerto in D minor\" (composed c. 1897) by the Polish composer Emil Młynarski. However, the unrest in Russia at that time prevented Rachmaninoff from visiting America, scuttling his planned April 7 performance. Instead, violinist and composer Émile Sauret was featured, performing Antonín Dvořák's \"Violin Concerto in A Minor\". The same concert included two pieces by composer Anton Arensky, who had died on February 25.\n\nBy the end of the 1906 season, the Russian Symphony Orchestra was an established part of the New York music scene. In all, the \"New York Times\" counted six New York premieres by the Russian Symphony Orchestra as such in 1906, and three more by the New Music Society. On May 25, the Society announced that Altschuler would be retained as Director for three more years, with Russian Ambassador Baron Roman Rosen continuing as honorary president. Looking forward to the 1906-1907 musical season, the \"Times\" counted them among the city's major orchestras, along with the New York Philharmonic, New York Symphony Orchestra, Peoples' Symphony Concerts, and Sam Franko's American Symphony.\n\nThe 1906-7 season saw an appearance by pianist and composer Alexander Scriabin under the baton of his (and Altschuler's) conservatory teacher Vasily Safonov. An anonymous \"New York Times\" review praised Scriabin's playing, while finding him immature as a composer. The same reviewer panned Alexander Glazunov's \"Third Symphony\", which had its American premiere on this occasion: \"[W]hat Russian music the conductor's of the more cosmopolitan orchestras have left for the Russians to put down on their programmes as given 'for the first time' may have been rejected rather than overlooked.\" Apparently undaunted by that criticism, the orchestra announced two days later that its concert of January 17 would feature American premieres of Rachmaninoff's \"Spring\" cantata and Jean Sibelius's \"Karelia\" overture, though apparently Rimsky-Korsakov's \"Antar\" was substituted for the Rachmininoff. \"The Times\" doubled down in its criticism: \"[M]any of the things by the Russian composers that we do not know seem upon presentation hardly worth knowing. … \"Antar\" … is no symphony by any recognized definition of the term… This would be nothing against the music if it could win acceptance for itself as music, which it did not last evening.\" While continuing its skepticism toward recent Russian music, the \"Times\" had high praise for soloist Fannie Bloomfield Zeisler's February 7, 1907 performance of Anton Rubenstein's already well-known D Minor Concerto (No. 4), though suggesting that the orchestra \"show[ed] a lack of rehearsal with the pianist.\" The fifth of six concerts that season on February 28, featuring a return by pianist Josef Lhévinne, consisted entirely of Russian pieces performed for the first time in America, although they were not recent works. The orchestral introduction of Mussorgsky's \"The Fair at Sorochyntsi\" and Rubinstein's \"Caprice Russe\" were both by composers who had died before the turn of the century. Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov's \"Iveria Suite\" (1896) and Alexander Scriabin's \"First Symphony\" (completed 1900), while also not particularly recent, were at least by then-living composers, and Scriabin was present for the occasion.\n\nThat summer, Altschuler traveled to Europe to engage soloists for the 1907-1908 season, which began with a special concert November 10 at their largest venue to date: accompanying violinist Jan Kubelik at the New York Hippodrome. (A similar performance was given the following year, March 15, 1908.) Four days later they began their regular season at Carnegie Hall with Russian ambassador Baron Rosen in attendance, and with a program consisting largely of American premieres of Russian pieces: Alexander Glazunov's \"Symphony No. 8\", composed roughly two years earlier; arrangements of Russian folk songs by Glazunov, Anatoly Lyadov, and Rimsky-Korsakov; and Mussorgsky's \"Great Gate of Kiev\". The program also featured the American debut of young Russian violinist Lea Luboshutz (listed at the time as \"Laya Luboshiz\"), who received eight curtain calls for her solo on Tchaikovsky's \"Violin Concerto\". She was not the only notable female soloist to play with the orchestra that season: on February 13, 1908, cellist May Muklé performed Karl Davydov's \"Cello Concerto No. 2 in A minor\".\n\n1908 also brought unprecedented recognition from Russia itself. The tsar granted the Order of Saint Stanislaus to orchestra president Frank Seymour Hastings in recognition of his promotion of Russian music in America.\n\nFor 1908-1909, the orchestra reduced its Carnegie Hall season from six performances to four, and began taking on other performance opportunities. At Carnegie Hall, they continued to present notable soloists: the debut of Mischa Elman (19 years old at the time), a return by Josef Lhévinne, and also an appearance by Alexander Petschnikoff. After a November 16, 1908 tryout in New Haven, Connecticut, on February 11, 1909, they collaborated with the Ben Greet Players on a Carnegie Hall performance of Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" incorporating Mendelssohn's incidental music, a performance that was repeated at Lake George on August 30 and at Carnegie Hall on New Year's Day 1910. These performances constituted the first time Mendelssohn's music was performed in conjunction with the play in the United States. The two groups collaborated further, including a 1910 production of Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\" and a series of performances in the 1910-1911 season which repeated these pieces and added \"As You Like It\", \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\", \"Macbeth\", and \"Sakuntala\".\n\nBesides a broader variety of New York performances, the orchestra toured extensively. Although they had already toured in December 1907, when the \"New York Times\" mentions them traveling to \"Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Madison, Wis. and other cities,\" bringing along pianists Ernest Hutcheson and Ernest Schelling, their 1908 touring plans extended as far as the West Coast. Their tours could involve large numbers of performances. For example, a newspaper from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania shows the orchestra performing four separate concerts (at 2 p.m., 4 p.m., 7:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m.) on a single Wednesday in September 1911. The programs were each entirely different, and the music ranged from Beethoven through Richard Wagner, Verdi and Puccini to Sibelius and Scriabin.\n\nThe orchestra began the 1910s with a premiere of a different sort. After a January 1 Carnegie Hall reprise of their \"Midsummer Night\" collaboration with Ben Greet, on January 20 their second performance of the new decade introduced dancer Maud Allan to the New York audience. Although American-born, Allan had begun her dancing career in England and Europe, and this was her first American appearance. Like Isadora Duncan and Loie Fuller, Allan choreographed for herself, using existing classical pieces. On this occasion she danced a piece on Ancient Greek themes, using music from Anton Rubenstein, Mendelssohn, Chopin, and Grieg. The performance alternated Allan's dances with straight orchestral performances. A concert a week later featured Rachmaninoff as a guest conductor for the American premiere of his \"Isle of the Dead\" and as a soloist on his \"Piano Concerto No. 2\". Further performances with Allan followed, with the dancer performing her signature \"Visions of Salomé\", among other pieces. On April 4, the orchestra played a benefit for Russian immigrants at the Waldorf-Astoria, featuring several musical soloists as well as ballet dancers Anna Pavlova and Mikhail Mordkin.\n\nThe 1910-1911 season featured five Carnegie Hall concerts interspersed with numerous out-of-town shows and followed by a 20-week national tour. Their New York season began November 17 with a concert that included a very different interpretation of Rachmaninoff's \"Symphony No. 2\", which they had premiered in 1901 and which had meanwhile become a \"celebrated\" and much-played work. After discussions with the composer, Altschuler had sped up the tempi and his reading of the piece had \"radically changed\". The concert also featured two American premieres of pieces by Anatoly Lyadov—\"Kikimora\" and \"Volshebnoye ozero (The Enchanted Lake)\", both written in 1909—Tchaikovsky's \"1812 Overture\", and several songs sung by German baritone Alexander Heinemann. The December 1 concert featured the U.S. debut of Canadian-born violinist Kathleen Parlow; the \"New York Times\" reviewer described her performance of Tchaikovsky's \"Violin Concerto\" as a \"remarkable achievement\" and praised her \"unexpected authority\", and would have equally high praise for her \"consummate technical accuracy…beauty of tone…spirit…[and]fire\" when she returned to play Henryk Wieniawski's \"Violin Concerto No. 2\" the following February 2. The concert was also the American premier of Stravinsky's \"Feu d'artifice\" (\"Fireworks\"). who had grown up largely in San Francisco and had become a professional musician in Europe. Starting four days later, they provided accompaniment for two-week run of Maeterlinck's tragedy \"Mary Magdalene\" at The New Theatre. This was the world premiere of that play, and the first U.S. performance of any Maeterlinck play.\n\nA January 19, 1911 concert featured German-Polish pianist and composer Xaver Scharwenka as the soloist on his own \"Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat minor\", as well as the American premiere of the Introduction and Wedding Procession from Rimsky-Korsakov's opera \"The Golden Cockerel\"; the concert also featured Rimsky-Korsakov's \"Christmas Eve Suite\" and the American premiere of a waltz that Tchaikovsky had written for \"The Nutcracker\" but omitted from the final version, and closed with Tchaikovsky's \"Marche Slave\". The February 2 concert featured the American premiere of Robert Kajanus' \"Finnish Rhapsody\", a return of Rachmaninoff's \"The Rock\" (which they had played in their second concert ever), and the return of violinist Kathleen Parlow performing the abovementioned Wieniawski concerto.\n\n"}

The audience listens to the story with certain expectations, which are either simply not met or met in some entirely unexpected manner. A lengthy shaggy dog story derives its humour from the fact that the joke-teller held the attention of the listeners for a long time (such jokes can take five minutes or more to tell) for no reason at all, as the end resolution is essentially meaningless.

The story builds up, repeatedly emphasizing how shaggy the dog is. At the climax of the story, someone in the story reacts with, \"That dog's not so shaggy.\" The expectations of the audience that have been built up by the presentation of the story, that the story will end with a punchline, are thus disappointed. Ted Cohen gives the following example of this story:\n\nHowever, authorities disagree as to whether this particular story is the archetype after which the category is named. Eric Partridge, for example, provides a very different story, as do William and Mary Morris in \"The Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins\".\n\nAccording to Partridge and the Morrises, the archetypical shaggy dog story involves an advertisement placed in the \"Times\" announcing a search for a shaggy dog. In the Partridge story, an aristocratic family living in Park Lane is searching for a lost dog, and an American answers the advertisement with a shaggy dog that he has found and personally brought across the Atlantic, only to be received by the butler at the end of the story who takes one look at the dog and shuts the door in his face, saying, \"But not so shaggy as \"that\", sir!\" In the Morris story, the advertiser is organizing a competition to find the shaggiest dog in the world, and after a lengthy exposition of the search for such a dog, a winner is presented to the aristocratic instigator of the competition, who says, \"I don't think he's so shaggy.\"\n\nA typical shaggy dog story occurs in Mark Twain's book about his travels west, \"Roughing It\". Twain's friends encourage him to go find a man called Jim Blaine when he is properly drunk, and ask him to tell \"the stirring story about his grandfather's old ram.\" Twain, encouraged by his friends who have already heard the story, finally finds Blaine, an old silver miner, who sets out to tell Twain and his friends the tale. Blaine starts out with the ram (\"There never was a bullier old ram than what he was\"), and goes on for four more mostly dull but occasionally hilarious unparagraphed pages.\n\nAlong the way, Blaine tells many stories, each of which connects back to the one before by some tenuous thread, and none of which has to do with the old ram. Among these stories are: a tale of boiled missionaries; of a lady who borrows a false eye, a peg leg, and the wig of a coffin-salesman's wife; and a final tale of a man who gets caught in machinery at a carpet factory and whose \"widder bought the piece of carpet that had his remains wove in ...\" As Blaine tells the story of the carpet man's funeral, he begins to fall asleep, and Twain, looking around, sees his friends \"suffocating with suppressed laughter.\" They now inform him that \"at a certain stage of intoxication, no human power could keep [Blaine] from setting out, with impressive unction, to tell about a wonderful adventure which he had once had with his grandfather's old ram — and the mention of the ram in the first sentence was as far as any man had heard him get, concerning it.\"\n\nIn the collection of stories by Isaac Asimov titled \"Buy Jupiter and Other Stories\", is a story titled \"Shah Guido G.\" In his background notes, Asimov identifies the tale as a shaggy dog story, and explains that the title is a play on \"shaggy dog\".\n\n\nComedians Buddy Hackett and Norm Macdonald are famous for telling shaggy dog stories.\n\n\n"}

The altarpiece was painted for the Church of SS. Annunziata in the Italian town of Ascoli Piceno, in the region of Marche, to celebrate the self-government granted to the town in 1482 by Pope Sixtus IV. The painting was removed to the Pinacoteca di Brera in Milan in 1811, but passed to Auguste-Louis de Sivry in 1820, and had reached England by the mid-19th century. It has been housed in the National Gallery in London since it was donated by Henry Labouchere, 1st Baron Taunton in 1864.\n\nThe light ray from the heaven represents Mary's impregnation by the Holy Spirit. The closed passage into the depth at the left and the flask of pure water in Mary's bedroom conventionally refer to Mary's virginity. The winged angel Gabriel is depicted with Saint Emidius, the patron saint of Ascoli Piceno carrying a model of that town. The apple in the foreground represents the forbidden fruit and associated fall of man. The cucumber symbolizes the promise of resurrection and redemption. The peacock symbolizes associated immortality, because it was believed that its flesh never decayed. An oriental carpet adorns the loggia on the first floor of the Mary's house.\n\nThe bottom portion of the painting features the coats of arms of Pope Sixtus IV and the local bishop, Prospero Caffarelli. The Latin words \"libertas ecclesiastica\" (church liberty) refer to the self-government of Ascoli Piceno under the general oversight of the Catholic Church. In fringe theories, the halo of the Holy Spirit on the painting is sometimes interpreted as an UFO. According to historian Massimo Polidoro who says what you are actually seeing is \"a vortex of angels in the clouds, another frequent representation of God in Medieval and Renaissance sacred works of art\". Painters at this time used \"symbolic meanings that were anything but random.\" Polidoro calls the UFO explanation, \"reinterpreting with the eyes of twenty-first-century Europeans the product of other cultures\". \n"}

{"id": "401353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=401353", "title": "The Theatre", "text": "The Theatre\n\nThe Theatre was an Elizabethan playhouse in Shoreditch (in Curtain Road, part of the modern London Borough of Hackney), just outside the City of London. It was the second permanent theatre ever built in England, after the Red Lion, and the first successful one. Built by actor-manager James Burbage, near the family home in Holywell Street, The Theatre is considered the first theatre built in London for the sole purpose of theatrical productions. The Theatre's history includes a number of important acting troupes including the Lord Chamberlain's Men, which employed Shakespeare as actor and playwright. After a dispute with the landlord, the theatre was dismantled and the timbers used in the construction of the Globe Theatre on Bankside.\n\nThe Mayor and Corporation of London banned plays in 1572 as a measure against the plague, not wanting to attract crowds of strangers. In 1575 they formally expelled all players from the city. This prompted the construction of playhouses outside the jurisdiction of London, in the liberties of Halliwell/Holywell in Shoreditch and later the Clink, and at Newington Butts near the established entertainment district of St. George's Fields in rural Surrey. The Theatre was constructed in 1576 by James Burbage in partnership with his brother-in-law, one John Brayne, (the owner of the Red Lion) on property that had originally been the grounds of the dissolved Halliwell Priory (or Holywell). Brayne had advanced Burbage the money needed to build The Theatre, and in return, Brayne received a portion of the profits and owned some of the property (Burbage married Brayne's daughter Ellen in 1575). The Theatre was in Shoreditch, beyond the northern boundary of the City of London and outside the jurisdiction of civil authorities, who were often opposed to the theatre. This area in the \"suburbs of sin\" was notorious for licentious behaviour, brothels and gaming houses. A year later the Curtain Theatre was built nearby, making the area London's first theatrical and entertainment district. \"When Burbage and Brayne mortgaged The Theatre, Brayne had just recently resolved another fight with one of his brothers-in-law over a different mortgage\" Brayne and Burbage had never written a contract, which eventually led to many quarrels concerning who spent what on getting The Theatre started. \n\nThroughout the building of The Theatre, Burbage and Brayne continually became indebted to each other. To fix this they constructed schemes to keep the building of The Theatre going. John Hind was one of the creditors for the construction of The Theatre, however, almost nothing else is known about him except that there was also a contract between him and Burbage/Brayne which entailed that he arrange players for them. One of their schemes was to put on plays in The Theatre while it was still being built, to raise money for further construction.\n\nAlthough Burbage's son later claimed the Theatre as the first permanent playhouse in the London conurbation, it may not have been the first permanent theatre to serve Londoners. The Newington Butts playhouse may have been built as early as 1575, certainly actor Jerome Savage renewed a lease on the site on 25 March 1576, three weeks before Burbage's lease in Shoreditch. Newington Butts was clearly established by Lady Day 1577, and Wickham \"et al.\" interpret the available documents as saying that Savage was adapting an existing building constructed by Richard Hicks rather than building from scratch.\n\nThe design of The Theatre was possibly adapted from the inn-yards that had served as playing spaces for actors and/or bear baiting pits. The building was a polygonal wooden building with three galleries surrounding an open yard. From one side of the polygon extended a thrust stage. The Theatre is said to have cost £700 to construct, which is a considerable sum for the age.\n\nThe open yard in front of the stage was cobbled and provided standing room for those who paid a penny. For another penny, the attendees were allowed into the galleries where they could either stand or, for a third penny, procure a stool. One of the galleries, though sources do not state which, was divided into small compartments that could be used by the wealthy and aristocrats. The playhouse was a timber building with a tile roof; other materials used to construct the Theatre were brick, sand, lime, lead, and iron. Owing to a lack of paperwork not much is truly known about the Theatre’s appearance, but it has been described as an \"amphitheater\".\n\nThe Theatre opened in the autumn of 1576, possibly as a venue for Leicester's Men, the acting company of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester of which James Burbage was a member. In the 1580s the Admiral's Men, of which James Burbage's son, Richard was a member, took up residence. After a disagreement between the company and young Burbage, most of the company left for the Rose Theatre which was under the management of Philip Henslowe.\n\nIn 1594, Richard Burbage became the leading actor of the Lord Chamberlain's Men which performed at The Theatre until 1597. Poet, playwright and actor William Shakespeare was also in the employ of the company and some of his early plays had their première at The Theatre. \"At Christmas 1594 [Richard] was summoned with two other members of his company, William Kempe and William Shakespeare, to act before the queen at Greenwich Palace... Numerous performances before Queen Elizabeth followed, and Shakespeare doubtless often accompanied Burbage on many subsequent professional visits to one or other of the royal palaces.\" Richard's most noted role is—which holds close to his namesake — his part as Richard in Shakespeare's Richard III. After the Burbages stripped The Theatre of its materials to erect The Globe, many of Shakespeare's plays were performed at the famous theatre in the summer and the Blackfriars house, another of the Burbage's theatres, was used as a winter playhouse.\n\nTowards the end of 1596, problems arose with the property's landlord, Giles Allen. Consequently, in 1597, the Lord Chamberlain's Men were forced to stop playing at The Theatre and moved to the nearby Curtain. The lease had been granted to Richard Burbage and his brother Cuthbert Burbage upon the death of their father. The lease that the late James Burbage had obtained from Allen in 1576 was to last only twenty years, but when that day did come, in 1596, Allen \"stipulated that the playhouse should only be applied to theatrical purposes for another five years. This stipulation was contested by Burbage, and he and his sons began a harassing lawsuit with Allen. But before the dispute had gone very far Burbage died (in the spring of 1597) and the suit was continued by his sons Richard and Cuthbert.\" The sight of the deserted Theatre prompted these lines from a minor satirist of the day:\n<poem>...But see yonder,\nOne like the unfrequented Theatre\nWalks in dark silence and vast solitude.</poem>\n\nBrayne's widow, Margaret Brayne, and former business partner, Robert Myles, filed a lawsuit against the Burbages after Brayne's death in 1586. When Brayne passed the Burbages halted their payments to Margaret for their debt. When they filed lawsuit, Margaret and Robert showed up at The Theatre demanding half of everything inside of it—in disagreement, Richard Burbage physically assaulted Robert Myles, and Robert and Margaret left empty handed. However, this was not the end as Myles attempted to bring down the Burbages in another two lawsuits, which both ended in failure. \"The old disputes of the Theatre were overtaken by the new litigation of the Alleyns-the original owners, when the Burbages dismantled the Theatre and rebuilt it as the Globe.\" At the time of Margaret Brayne's death there were still lawsuits that had not been settled, and in her last will and testament she left all of her prospective winnings to Robert Myles.\n\nThough Giles Allen was the landlord John Hyde legally owned the lease to the Theatre and would return the lease to Richard and Cuthbert Burbage and Margaret Brayne for the sum of £30. Cuthbert then went to Walter Cope, a trusted business man, and had Cope ask Hyde if Cuthbert could outright pay for the lease and own it himself. Cuthbert paid and outright owned the lease now, ultimately squeezing Margaret Brayne out of the business. They justified this by stating that now that the lease was in Cuthbert’s name and no longer in James’ name John Brayne had no dealings with the Theatre and therefore neither did Margaret Brayne.\n\nThis state of affairs forced the Burbage brothers to take drastic action to save their investment. In defiance of the landlord and with the help of their friend and financial backer William Smith, chief carpenter Peter Street and ten or twelve workmen, they dismantled the theatre on the night of 28 December 1598 and moved the structure piecemeal to Street's yard near to Bridewell. With the onset of more favourable weather in the following spring, the material was ferried over the Thames to reconstruct it as The Globe. Giles Allen then sued Peter Street in January 1599 for trespassing on the property of the Theatre, stating that Street had no right to dismantle the Theatre and move the supplies. He also attempted to sue Cuthbert and Richard Burbage for trespassing.\n\nIn August 2008 archaeologists from the Museum of London excavating in New Inn Broadway, Shoreditch, announced they had found the foundation of a polygonal structure they believed to be the remains of the north-eastern corner of The Theatre. The Theatre and Shakespeare's involvement with it are commemorated by two plaques on 86–90 Curtain Road, the building at the corner with New Inn Yard currently occupied by a Foxtons office. \n\n\nBerry, Herbert. \"John Brayne and his other brother-in-law.\" Shakespeare Studies (2002): 93+.

The building has served as an event and meeting space since 1979, when it was purchased by the San Francisco Women's Center. The building is shielded from rising real estate costs in the Mission district because that group has owned the building since 1995. The four-story building rents to multiple tenants and serves over 20,000 women a year.\n\nThe structure was built in 1910 and was originally known as Turn Hall because it was part of the Turnverein exercise movement. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018.\n\nThe San Francisco Women's Center began in 1973. By 1974, it hired its first full-time employee and had moved into a small storefront office. In 1976, its difficulty in locating a venue for the national conference on Violence Against Women it was organizing with other women's groups led it to search for a permanent space. Through 1978 and 1979, it raised funds to put down an initial $10,000 deposit, and then a $115,000 first payment towards the $535,000 purchase price of the building at 3543 18th Street. \n\nTracy Gary, one of the organizers of the Violence Against Women conference, and co-founder of the Women's Building, along with co-founder Marya Grambs and Women's Building staff member Carmen Vázquez, were interviewed in 1982 by Julia Randall for KPFA for the building's 3rd birthday. The women discuss the difficulties of the early years and how the building was being used in 1982. Roma Guy and her partner Diane were also two of the Women's Building's co-founders.\n\nIn the first year of operation, the Women's Building was targeted by two attacks: an arson fire that caused $50,000 worth of damage, and a pipe bomb set off on the front steps of the building.\n\nIn 1997, the Women's Building underwent a major renovation prompted by mandatory seismic retrofitting. In the course of that effort, it evicted the Dovre Club, a bar that had been in the corner of the building on 18th and Lapidge Streets since 1979. The original owner of that bar had an oral agreement with the Women's Center that the bar could stay in place during his lifetime; after his death in 1997, the bar made an effort to stay in place but ultimately relocated.\n\nPainted by seven women artists including, Juana Alicia, Miranda Bergman, Edythe Boone, Susan Kelk Cervantes (cofounder of Precita Eyes Muralists Association), Meera Desai, Yvonne Littleton and Irene Perez along with their helpers and volunteers in 1994, the mural titled \"MaestraPeace\" covers both the outside of The Women's Building as well as the interior entrance hall and stairway. It features images of feminine icons from history and fiction, and the names of more than 600 women written in calligraphy. According to the San Francisco Women's Center, \"This spectacular mural is a culmination of a multi-cultural, multi-generation collaboration of seven women artists, and a colorful work of art that sings to our community.\" \n\nMany of the original artists returned to the building for an update in 2000, an expansion to the inside of the building in 2010, and a major $130,000 restoration in 2012. That last restoration included a treatment process designed to preserve the colors of the mural for another 100 years.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13878013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13878013", "title": "Verisimilitude (fiction)", "text": "Verisimilitude (fiction)\n\nVerisimilitude is the \"lifelikeness\" or believability of a work of fiction. The word comes from meaning truth and \"similis\" meaning similar. Language philosopher Steve Neale distinguishes between two types: cultural verisimilitude, meaning plausibility of the fictional work within the cultural and/or historical context of the real world, outside of the work; and generic verisimilitude, meaning plausibility of a fictional work within the bounds of its own genre (so that, for example, characters regularly singing about their feelings is a believable action within the fictional universe of a musical).\n\nVerisimilitude has its roots in both the Platonic and Aristotelian dramatic theory of mimesis, the imitation or representation of nature. For a piece of art to hold significance or persuasion for an audience, according to Plato and Aristotle, it must have grounding in reality.\n\nThis idea laid the foundation for the evolution of mimesis into verisimilitude in the Middle Ages particularly in Italian heroic poetry. During this time more attention was invested in pinning down fiction with theory. This shift manifested itself in increased focus on unity in heroic poetry. No matter how fictionalized the language of a poem might be, through verisimilitude, poets had the ability to present their works in a way that could still be believed in the real world. Verisimilitude at this time also became connected to another Aristotelian dramatic principle, decorum: the realistic union of style and subject. Poetic language of characters in a work of fiction as a result had to be appropriate in terms of the age, gender or race of the character.\n\nThis classical notion of verisimilitude focused on the role of the reader in his/her engagement in the fictional work of art. The goal of the novel therefore, as it became a more popular form of verisimilitude, was to instruct and offer a pleasurable experience to the reader. The novel had to facilitate the reader's willingness to suspend his/her disbelief, a phrase used originally by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Verisimilitude became the means to accomplish this mindset. To promote the willing suspension of disbelief, a fictional text needed to have credibility. Anything physically possible in the worldview of the reader or humanity's experience was defined as credible. Through verisimilitude then, the reader was able to glean truth even in fiction because it would reflect realistic aspects of human life.\n\nThe idea that credibility, and in turn verisimilitude, rested on the reader's sense of the world encountered opposition because of the dilemma it created: every reader and every person does not have the same knowledge of the world. This kind of theory suggests that the novel consisted of distinct parts. The way novelists avoided this dilemma initially was by adding a preface to the work of fiction stating its credibility or by including more references to known history within the text of the fiction. \n\nAs more criticism on the novel surfaced, the inclusion of a preface or a scattering of some historical references was not enough to engage the reader. French theorist Pierre Nicolas Desmolets' notion that the author should obscure the fiction or art of the novel to avoid destroying illusion: the made up attributes of the text. The novel before was perceived as a work of distinct parts. Now the novel was not thought of in terms of separate parts, but rather as a work as a whole. The novel was a total illusion of life within itself. It was a closed fictional world that could establish its own rules and laws. Verisimilitude then became deeply rooted in structure. The focus of credibility did not rest solely on the external world of the reader; the novel's credibility then could be seen in terms of the novel's own internal logic. \n\nThe focus of verisimilitude was no longer concerned with the reader. The focus shifted to the novel itself. Verisimilitude was a technical problem to resolve within the context of the novel's fictional world. Detail centered on the creation of a logical cause web in the text that then could reinforce the overarching structural logic of the plot.\n\nDuring the rise of the postmodern novel, some critics suggested that truth or significance lies beyond verisimilitude and that only by complete non-discursive freedom to encounter a novel could meaning truly be discovered. Verisimilitude, they argued, was not the first aspect of the text a reader experiences. The reader instead first tries to observe if the novel works as an intelligible narrative. The lens of verisimilitude is applied only after the reader establishes if the novel makes sense or not.\n\nThe reader can understand the novel as art but not necessarily as a cultural construction. The novel should challenge the construction of reality. In this sense, it was possible for art to precede reality. Reality had to catch up to the text rather than text staying present to reality. A boundary existed establishing that text does not belong to a current time or situation. In the postmodern context, verisimilitude was less of a concern for the novelist according to some critics.\n\n"}
{"id": "372478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=372478", "title": "Video game industry", "text": "Video game industry\n\nThe video game industry is the economic sector involved in the development, marketing, and monetization of video games. It encompasses dozens of job disciplines and its component parts employ thousands of people worldwide.\n\nThe computer and video game industry has grown from focused markets to mainstream. They took in about US$9.5 billion in the US in 2007, 11.7 billion in 2008, and 25.1 billion in 2010 (ESA annual report).\n\nModern personal computers owe many advancements and innovations to the game industry: sound cards, graphics cards and 3D graphic accelerators, faster CPUs, and dedicated co-processors like PhysX are a few of the more notable improvements.\n\nSound cards were developed for addition of digital-quality sound to games and only later improved for music and audiophiles. Early on, graphics cards were developed for more colors. Later, graphic cards were developed for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and games; GUIs drove the need for high resolution, and games began using 3D acceleration. They also are one of the only pieces of hardware to allow multiple hookups (such as with SLI or CrossFire graphics cards). CD- and DVD-ROMs were developed for mass distribution of media in general; however the ability to store more information on cheap easily distributable media was instrumental in driving their ever-higher speeds.\n\nBen Sawyer of Digitalmill observes that the game industry value chain is made up of six connected and distinctive layers:\n\nThe game industry employs those experienced in other traditional businesses, but some have experience tailored to the game industry. Some of the disciplines specific to the game industry include: game programmer, game designer, level designer, game producer, game artist and game tester. Most of these professionals are employed by video game developers or video game publishers. However, many hobbyists also produce computer games and sell them commercially. Game developers and publishers sometimes employ those with extensive or long-term experience within the modding communities.\n\nPrior to the 1970s, there was no significant commercial aspect of the video game industry, but many advances in computing would set the stage for the birth of the industry.\n\nMany early publicly-available interactive computer-based game machines used or other mechanisms to mimic a display; while technically not \"video games\", they had elements of interactivity between the player and the machine. Some examples of these included the 1940 \"Nimatron\", an electromagentic relay-based Nim-playing device designed by Edward Condon and built by Westinghouse Electric for the New York World's Fair, \"Bertie the Brain\", an arcade game of tic-tac-toe, built by Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition, and Nimrod created by engineering firm Ferranti for the 1951 Festival of Britain,\n\nThe development of cathode ray tube—the core technology behind televisions—created several of the first true video games. In 1947 Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann filed a patent for a \"cathode ray tube amusement device\". Their game, which uses a cathode ray tube hooked to an oscilloscope display, challenges players to fire a gun at target.\n\nBetween the 1950s and 1960s, with mainframe computers becoming available to campus colleges, students and others started to develop games that could be played at terminals that accessed the mainframe. One of the first known examples is \"Spacewar!\", developed by Harvard and MIT employees Martin Graetz, Steve Russell, and Wayne Wiitanen. The introduction of easy-to-program languages like BASIC for mainframes allowed for more simplistic games to be developed.\n\nIn 1971, the arcade game, \"Computer Space was released.\" The following year, Atari, Inc. released the first commercially successful video game, \"Pong\", the original arcade version of which sold over 19,000 arcade cabinets. That same year saw the introduction of video games to the home market with the release of the early video game console, the Magnavox Odyssey. However, both the arcade and home markets would be dominated by \"Pong\" clones, which flooded the market and led to the video game crash of 1977. The crash eventually came to an end with the success of Taito's \"Space Invaders\", released in 1978, sparking a renaissance for the video game industry and paving the way for the golden age of video arcade games. The game's success inspired arcade machines to become prevalent in mainstream locations such as shopping malls, traditional storefronts, restaurants and convenience stores during the golden age. \"Space Invaders\" would go on to sell over 360,000 arcade cabinets worldwide, and by 1982, generate a revenue of $2 billion in quarters, equivalent to $4.6 billion in 2011.\n\nSoon after, \"Space Invaders\" was licensed for the Atari VCS (later known as Atari 2600), becoming the first \"killer app\" and quadrupling the console's sales. The success of the Atari 2600 in turn revived the home video game market during the second generation of consoles, up until the North American video game crash of 1983. By the end of the 1970s, the personal computer game industry began forming from a hobby culture.\n\nThe early 1980s saw the golden age of video arcade games reach its zenith. The total sales of arcade video game machines in North America increased significantly during this period, from $50 million in 1978 to $900 million by 1981, with the arcade video game industry's revenue in North America tripling to $2.8 billion in 1980. By 1981, the arcade video game industry was generating an annual revenue of $5 billion in North America, equivalent to $12.3 billion in 2011. In 1982, the arcade video game industry reached its peak, generating $8 billion in quarters, equivalent to over $18.5 billion in 2011, surpassing the annual gross revenue of both pop music ($4 billion) and Hollywood films ($3 billion) combined at that time. This was also nearly twice as much revenue as the $3.8 billion generated by the home video game industry that same year; both the arcade and home markets combined add up to a total revenue of $11.8 billion for the video game industry in 1982, equivalent to over $27.3 billion in 2011. The arcade video game industry would continue to generate an annual revenue of $5 billion in quarters through to 1985. The most successful game of this era was Namco's \"Pac-Man\", released in 1980, which would go on to sell over 350,000 cabinets, and within a year, generate a revenue of more than $1 billion in quarters; in total, \"Pac-Man\" is estimated to have grossed over 10 billion quarters ($2.5 billion) during the 20th century, equivalent to over $3.4 billion in 2011.\n\nThe early part of the decade saw the rise of 8-bit home computing, and home-made games, especially in Europe (with the ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64) and Asia (with the NEC PC-88 and MSX). This time also saw the rise of video game journalism, which was later expanded to include covermounted cassettes and CDs.\nIn 1983, the North American industry crashed due to the production of too many badly developed games (quantity over quality), resulting in the fall of the North American industry. The industry would eventually be revitalized by the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System, which resulted in the home console market being dominated by Japanese companies such as Nintendo, while a professional European computer game industry also began taking shape with companies such as Ocean Software and Gremlin Interactive. The latter part of the decade saw the rise of the Game Boy handheld system. In 1987, Nintendo lost a legal challenge against Blockbuster Entertainment, which enabled games rentals in the same way as movies.\n\nThe 1990s saw advancements in game related technology. Among the significant advancements were:\n\nAside from technology, in the early part of the decade, licensed games became more popular, as did video game sequels.\n\nThe video game industry generated worldwide sales of $19.8 billion in 1993 (equivalent to $31 billion in 2011), $20.8 billion in 1994 (equivalent to $32 billion in 2011), and an estimated $30 billion in 1998 (equivalent to $41.5 billion in 2011). In the United States alone, in 1994, arcades were generating $7 billion in quarters (equivalent to $11 billion in 2011) while home console game sales were generating revenues of $6 billion (equivalent to $9 billion in 2011). Combined, this was nearly two and a half times the $5 billion revenue generated by movies in the United States at the time.\n\nIn 2000s, the video game industry is a juggernaut of development; profit still drives technological advancement which is then used by other industry sectors. Technologies such as Smartphones, virtual reality and augmented reality are major drivers for game hardware and gameplay development. Though maturing, the video game industry was still very volatile, with third-party video game developers quickly cropping up, and just as quickly, going out of business. Nevertheless, many casual games and indie games were developed and become popular and successful, such as \"Braid\" and \"Limbo\". Game development for mobile phones (such as iOS and Android devices) and social networking sites emerged. For example, a Facebook game developer, Zynga, has raised in excess of $300 million.\n\nThough not the main driving force, indie games continue to have a significant impact on the industry, with sales of some of these titles such as \"Spelunky\", \"Fez\", \"Don't Starve\", \"Castle Crashers\", and \"Minecraft\", exceeding millions of dollars and over a million users. The 2010s have seen a larger shift to casual and mobile gaming; in 2016, the mobile gaming market is estimated to have taken $38 billion in revenues, compared to $6 billion for the console market and $33 billion for personal computing gaming. Games centered on virtual reality and augmented reality equipment also arose during this decade. As of 2014, newer game companies arose that vertically integrate live operations and publishing such as crowdfunding and other direct-to-consumer efforts, rather than relying on a traditional publishers, and some of these have grown to substantial size. Spurred by some initial events in the late 2000s, eSports centered around professional players in organized competitions and leagues for prize money, grew greatly over this decade, drawing hundreds of millions of viewers and reaching nearly $500 million in revenue by 2016 and expected to break $1 billion by 2019.\n\nEarly on, development costs were minimal, and video games could be quite profitable. Games developed by a single programmer, or by a small team of programmers and artists, could sell hundreds of thousands of copies each. Many of these games only took a few months to create, so developers could release multiple titles per year. Thus, publishers could often be generous with benefits, such as royalties on the games sold. Many early game publishers started from this economic climate, such as Origin Systems, Sierra Entertainment, Capcom, Activision and Electronic Arts.\n\nAs computing and graphics power increased, so too did the size of development teams, as larger staffs were needed to address the ever-increasing technical and design complexities. The larger teams consist of programmers, artists, game designers, and producers. Their salaries can range anywhere from $50,000 to $120,000 generating large labor costs for firms producing videogames which can often take between one and three years to develop. Now budgets typically reach millions of dollars despite the growing popularity of middleware and pre-built game engines. In addition to growing development costs, marketing budgets have grown dramatically, sometimes consisting of two to three times of the cost of development.\n\nThe game development team has to select a profitable and suitable method to sell or earn money from the finished game. Traditionally, the game monetization method is to sell hard copies in retail store. Now some developers are turning to alternative production and distribution methods, such as online distribution, to reduce costs and increase revenue.\n\nToday, the video game industry has a major impact on the economy through the sales of major systems and games such as \"\", which took in over $650 USD million of sales in the game's first five days and which set a five-day global record for a movie, book or videogame. The game's income was more than the opening weekend of \"Spider-Man 3\" and the previous title holder for a video game \"Halo 3\". Many individuals have also benefited from the economic success of video games including the former chairman of Nintendo and Japan's third richest man: Hiroshi Yamauchi. Today the global video game market is valued at over $93 billion.\n\nThe industry wide adoption of high-definition graphics during the seventh generation of consoles greatly increased development teams' sizes and reduced the number of high-budget, high-quality titles under development. In 2013 Richard Hilleman of Electronic Arts estimated that only 25 developers were working on such titles for the eighth console generation, compared to 125 at the same point in the seventh generation-console cycle seven or eight years earlier.\n\nThe games industry's shift from brick and mortar retail to digital downloads led to a severe sales decline at video game retailers such as GameStop, following other media retailers superseded by Internet delivery, such as Blockbuster, Tower Records, and Virgin Megastores. GameStop diversified its services by purchasing chains that repair wireless devices and expanding its trade-in program through which customers trade used games for credit towards new games. The company began to produce its own merchandise and games. In Britain, the games retailer Game revamped its stores so customers would spend time playing games there. It built a gaming arena for events and tournaments. The shift to digital marketplaces, especially for smartphones, led to an influx of inexpensive and disposable titles, as well as lower engagement among gamers who otherwise purchased new games from retail. Customers also shifted away from the tradition of buying games on their first day of release.\n\nPublishers often funded trade-in deals to encourage consumers to purchase new games. Trade-in customers at the Australia retailer Game would purchase twice the games per year as non-trade-in customers. The sale of pre-owned games kept retailers in business, and composed about a third of Game's revenue. Retailers also saved on the UK's value-added tax, which only taxed the retailer's profit on pre-owned games, rather than the full sale on regular games. The former trade-in retail executives behind the trade-in price comparison site Trade In Detectives estimated that the United Kingdom's trade-in industry was about a third of the size of its new games business. They figured that sites such as eBay, which convert used games into cash, compose about a quarter of the UK's trade-in market, but do not keep the credit within the industry. While consumers might appear to receive better offers on these sites, they also take about 15 percent of the selling price in fees. Alternatively, some retailers will match the trade-in values offered by their competitors. Microsoft's original plan for the Xbox One attempted to translate trade-in deals for the digital marketplace, with a database of product licenses that shops would be able to resell with publisher permission, though the plan was poorly received or poorly sold.\n\nVideo game industry practices are similar to those of other entertainment industries (e.g., the music recording industry), but the video game industry in particular has been accused of treating its development talent poorly. This promotes independent development, as developers leave to form new companies and projects. In some notable cases, these new companies grow large and impersonal, having adopted the business practices of their forebears, and ultimately perpetuate the cycle.\n\nHowever, unlike the music industry, where modern technology has allowed a fully professional product to be created extremely inexpensively by an independent musician, modern games require increasing amounts of manpower and equipment. This dynamic makes publishers, who fund the developers, much more important than in the music industry.\n\nIn the video game industry, it is common for developers to leave their current studio and start their own. A particularly famous case is the \"original\" independent developer Activision, founded by former Atari developers. Activision grew to become the world's second largest game publisher. In the mean time, many of the original developers left to work on other projects. For example, founder Alan Miller left Activision to start another video game development company, Accolade (now Atari née Infogrames).\n\nActivision was popular among developers for giving them credit in the packaging and title screens for their games, while Atari disallowed this practice. As the video game industry took off in the mid-1980s, many developers faced the more distressing problem of working with fly-by-night or unscrupulous publishers that would either fold unexpectedly or run off with the game profits.\n\nThe industry claims software piracy to be a big problem, and take measures to counter this. \nDigital rights management have proved to be the most unpopular with gamers, as a measure to counter piracy.\nThe most popular and effective strategy to counter piracy is to change the business model to Freemium, where gamers pay for their in-game needs or service. Strong server-side security is required for this, to properly distinguish authentic transactions from hacked (faked) transactions.\n\nOn various Internet forums, some gamers have expressed disapproval of publishers having creative control since publishers are more apt to follow short-term market trends rather than invest in risky but potentially lucrative ideas. On the other hand, publishers may know better than developers what consumers want. The relationship between video game developers and publishers parallels the relationship between recording artists and record labels in many ways. But unlike the music industry, which has seen flat or declining sales in the early 2000s, the video game industry continues to grow. Also, personal computers have made the independent development of music almost effortless, while the gap between an independent game developer and the product of a fully financed one grows larger.\n\nIn the computer games industry, it is easier to create a startup, resulting in many successful companies. The console games industry is a more closed one, and a game developer must have up to three licenses from the console manufacturer:\n\nIn addition, the developer must usually buy development systems from the console manufacturer in order to even develop a game for consideration, as well as obtain concept approval for the game from the console manufacturer. Therefore, the developer normally has to have a publishing deal in place before starting development on a game project, but in order to secure a publishing deal, the developer must have a track record of console development, something which few startups will have.\n\nAn alternative method for publishing video games is to self-publish using the shareware or open source model over the Internet.\n\nGaming conventions are an important showcase of the industry. The major annual gaming conventions include gamescom in Cologne (Germany), the E3 in Los Angeles (USA), the Penny Arcade Expo, and .\n\nAs with other forms of media, video games have often been released in different world regions at different times. The practice has been used where localization is not done in parallel with the rest of development or where the game must be encoded differently, as in PAL vs. NTSC. It has also been used to provide price discrimination in different markets or to focus limited marketing resources. Developers may also stagger digital releases so as not to overwhelm the servers hosting the game.\n\nInternational video game revenue is estimated to be $81.5B in 2014. This is more than double the revenue of the international film industry in 2013. In 2015, it was estimated at .\n\nThe largest nations by estimated video game revenues in 2016 are China ($24.4B), the United States ($23.5B) and Japan ($12.4B). The largest regions in 2015 were Asia-Pacific ($43.1B), North America ($23.8B), and Western Europe ($15.6B).\n\nGaming conventions are an important showcase of the industry. The annual gamescom in Cologne (Germany) is a major expo for video games. The E3 in Los Angeles (USA) is also of global importance, but is an event for industry insiders only.\n\nOther notable conventions and trade fairs include Tokyo Game Show (Japan), Brasil Game Show (Brazil), EB Games Expo (Australia), KRI (Russia), ChinaJoy (China) and the annual Game Developers Conference. Some publishers, developers and technology producers also have their own regular conventions, with BlizzCon, QuakeCon, Nvision and the X shows being prominent examples.\n\nVideo gaming is still in its infancy throughout the African continent, but due to the continent's young population and increasing technological literacy, the sector is growing rapidly. African countries such as South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya have been making rapid advances in mobile game development, both within their country and internationally, but due to limited funding and a market over-crowded with western games, success has thus far been minimal.\n\nCanada has the third largest video game industry in terms of employment numbers. The video game industry has also been booming in Montreal since 1997, coinciding with the opening of Ubisoft Montreal. Recently, the city has attracted world leading game developers and publishers studios such as Ubisoft, EA, Eidos Interactive, Artificial Mind and Movement, BioWare, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and Strategy First, mainly because video games jobs have been heavily subsidized by the provincial government. Every year, this industry generates billions of dollars and thousands of jobs in the Montreal area. Vancouver has also developed a particularly large cluster of video game developers, the largest of which, Electronic Arts, employs over two thousand people. The \"Assassin's Creed\" series, along with the \"Tom Clancy\" series have all been produced in Canada and have achieved worldwide success. For consumers, the largest video games convention in Canada is the Enthusiast Gaming Live Expo (EGLX).\n\nChina is the largest country by game revenue, and has a gaming public that exceeds the population of the entire United States. It is home to Asia Game Show, the largest game convention in the world by attendance. In 2014, the Xbox One became the first new game console sold since China's ban on consoles in 2000.\n\nGermany has the largest video games market in Europe, with revenues of $4.1 billion forecast for 2017. The annual gamescom in Cologne is Europe's largest gaming expo.\n\nOne of the earliest internationally successful video game companies was Gütersloh-based Rainbow Arts (founded in 1984) who were responsible for publishing the popular \"Turrican\" series of games. The Anno series and The Settlers series are globally popular strategy game franchises since the 1990s. The Gothic series, and Risen are established RPG franchises. The X series by Egosoft is the best-selling space simulation. The FIFA Manager series was also developed in Germany. The German action game (2012) was successful in the markets and received largely positive reviews. One of the most famed titles to come out of Germany is \"Far Cry\" (2004) by Frankfurt-based Crytek, who also produced the topseller \"Crysis\" and its sequels later.\n\nOther well-known current and former developers from Germany include Ascaron, Blue Byte, Deck13, Phenomic, Piranha Bytes, Radon, Related, Spellbound and Yager Development. Publishers include Deep Silver (Koch Media), dtp entertainment, Kalypso and Nintendo Europe. Bigpoint Games, Gameforge, Goodgame Studios and Wooga are among the world's leading browser game and social network game developers/distributors.\n\nThe Japanese video game industry is markedly different from the industry in North America, Europe and Australia.\nJapanese companies have created some of the largest and most lucrative titles ever made, such as the \"Mario\", \"Final Fantasy\", \"Metal Gear\", \"Pokémon\" and \"Resident Evil\" series of games.\nIn recent years, consoles and arcade games have both been overtaken by downloadable free-to-play games on the PC and mobile platforms.\n\nThe UK industry is the third largest in the World in terms of developer success and sales of hardware and software by country alone but fourth behind Canada in terms of people employed. The size of the UK game industry is comparable to its film or music industries. In recent years some of the studios have become defunct or been purchased by larger companies such as \"LittleBigPlanet\" developer, Media Molecule and Codemasters. The country is home to some of the world's most successful video game franchises, such as \"Tomb Raider\", \"Grand Theft Auto\", \"Fable\", \"\" and \"Total War\".\n\nThe country also went without tax relief until March 21, 2012 when the British government changed its mind on tax relief for UK developers, which without, meant most of the talented development within the UK may move overseas for more profit, along with parents of certain video game developers which would pay for having games developed in the UK. The industry trade body TIGA estimates that it will increase the games development sector's contribution to UK GDP by £283 million, generate £172 million in new and protected tax receipts to HM Treasury, and could cost just £96 million over five years. Before the tax relief was introduced there was a fear that the UK games industry could fall behind other leading game industries around the world such as France and Canada, of which Canada overtook the UK in terms of job numbers in the industry in 2010.\n\nThe United States has the largest video games presence in the world in terms of total industry employees. In 2004, the U.S. game industry as a whole was worth US$10.3 billion. U.S. gaming revenue is forecast to reach $23.5 billion in 2017, making it the second largest market behind China.\n\nMagnavox is credited for releasing the first video game console, the Odyssey. Activision was the first developer to create independent/third-party video games. Once the fastest-growing American company, Atari crashed in spectacular fashion, resulting in the North American video game crash of 1983. This resulted in the domination of the Japanese video game industry worldwide throughout the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThe U.S. is home to major game development companies such as Activision Blizzard (\"Call of Duty\", \"World of Warcraft\"), Electronic Arts (\"FIFA\", \"Battlefield\", \"Mass Effect\"), and Take-Two Interactive (Civilization, \"NBA 2K\" series, \"Grand Theft Auto\"). ZeniMax Media (\"Doom\", \"Fallout\", \"The Elder Scrolls\") is the world's largest privately held video game company. Niantic (\"Ingress\", \"Pokémon Go\") is a notable mobile game developer.\n\nValve Corporation operates Steam, the largest computer gaming platform, with an active user base (~125 million) that rivals the combined user bases of the current console generation (~150 million). While not specifically focused on games, the largest mobile gaming platforms are operated by Google (Google Play), and Apple Inc. (App Store), with the majority of mobile revenue coming from Asia. Microsoft operates Xbox, the only major game console hardware franchise not controlled by a Japanese company. Sony established Sony Interactive Entertainment in Silicon Valley to run PlayStation, the world's largest and longest-running video game console franchise.\n\nIntel and Nvidia are the largest makers of PC graphics chips. Advanced Micro Devices has become the most important console processor vendor, with all three of the eighth generation home consoles using AMD GPUs, and two of them use AMD CPUs. Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony were not aware that they were all using AMD processors until all their consoles were announced, underscoring the secrecy found within the game industry. Notable game engine developers include Epic Games (Unreal Engine) and Unity Technologies (Unity).\n\nThe West Coast is home to important video game conventions, such as Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), one of the largest video game industry-only events in the world, and Penny Arcade Expo (PAX West), the largest public video game convention in North America. The West Coast is also home to many of the major American video game industry companies, particularly the regions of Los Angeles, San Francisco Bay Area, and Seattle. Major game development regions outside of the West Coast include the Northeast and Texas.\n\nOver 150 million Americans play video games, with an average age of 35 and a gender breakdown of 59 percent male and 41 percent female. American gamers are more likely to vote than non-gamers, feel that the economy is the most important political issue, and lean conservative.\n\nSeveral important game development personalities were born in or moved to the United States. Notable developers include Ralph H. Baer (Magnavox Odyssey, the \"Father of Video Games\"), Jonathan Blow (\"Braid\"), John D. Carmack (\"Doom\", \"Quake\"), and Alexey Pajitnov (\"Tetris\"). Mario is named after Mario Segale, a former landlord of Nintendo of America. Some right-wing and left-wing activists, including Jack Thompson and Anita Sarkeesian, have met extreme resistance from the gaming public in response to the perceived politicizing of their art form.\n\nThe United States recognizes eSports players as professional athletes. Major League Gaming has eSports arenas and studios across the nation. Robert Morris University has a League of Legends varsity team, whose members are eligible for scholarships.\n\nPlayers become fourth-party developers, allowing for more open source models of game design, development and engineering. Players also create modifications (mods), which in some cases become just as popular as the original game for which they were created. An example of this is the game \"Counter-Strike\", which began as a mod of the video game \"Half-Life\" and eventually became a very successful, published game in its own right.\n\nWhile this \"community of modifiers\" may only add up to approximately 1% of a particular game's user base, the number of those involved will grow as more games offer modifying opportunities (such as, by releasing source code) and the video user base swells. According to Ben Sawyer, as many as 600,000 established online game community developers existed as of 2012. This effectively added a new component to the game industry value chain and if it continues to mature, it will integrate itself into the overall industry.\n\nThe industry has seen a shift towards games with multiplayer facilities. A larger percentage of games on all types of platforms include some type of competitive online multiplayer capability.\n\nIn addition, the industry is experiencing further significant change driven by convergence, with technology and player comfort being the two primary reasons for this wave of industry convergence. Video games and related content can now be accessed and played on a variety of media, including: cable television, dedicated consoles, handheld devices and smartphones, through social networking sites or through an ISP, through a game developer's website, and online through a game console and/or home or office personal computer. In fact, 12% of U.S. households already make regular use of game consoles for accessing video content provided by online services such as Hulu and Netflix. In 2012, for the first time, entertainment usage passed multiplayer game usage on Xbox, meaning that users spent more time with online video and music services and applications than playing multiplayer games. This rapid type of industry convergence has caused the distinction between video game console and personal computers to disappear. A game console with high-speed microprocessors attached to a television set is, for all intents and purposes, a computer and monitor.\n\nAs this distinction has been diminished, players' willingness to play and access content on different platforms has increased. The growing video gamer demographic accounts for this trend, as former president of the Entertainment Software Association Douglas Lowenstein explained at the 10th E3 expo, \"Looking ahead, a child born in 1995, E3's inaugural year, will be 19 years old in 2014. And according to Census Bureau data, by the year 2020, there will be 174 million Americans between the ages of 5 and 44. That's 174 million Americans who will have grown up with PlayStations, Xboxes, and GameCubes from their early childhood and teenage years...What this means is that the average gamer will be both older and, given their lifetime familiarity with playing interactive games, more sophisticated and discriminating about the games they play.\"\n\nEvidence of the increasing player willingness to play video games across a variety of media and different platforms can be seen in the rise of casual gaming on smartphones, tablets, and social networking sites as 92% of all smartphone and tablet owners play games at least once a week, 45% play daily, and industry estimates predict that, by 2016, one-third of all global mobile gaming revenue will come from tablets alone. Apple's App Store alone has more than 90,000 game apps, a growth of 1,400% since it went online. In addition, game revenues for iOS and Android mobile devices now exceed those of both Nintendo and Sony handheld gaming systems combined.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "399747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=399747", "title": "William-Adolphe Bouguereau", "text": "William-Adolphe Bouguereau\n\nWilliam-Adolphe Bouguereau (; 30 November 1825 – 19 August 1905) was a French academic painter. In his realistic genre paintings he used mythological themes, making modern interpretations of classical subjects, with an emphasis on the female human body. During his life he enjoyed significant popularity in France and the United States, was given numerous official honors, and received top prices for his work. As the quintessential salon painter of his generation, he was reviled by the Impressionist avant-garde. By the early twentieth century, Bouguereau and his art fell out of favor with the public, due in part to changing tastes. In the 1980s, a revival of interest in figure painting led to a rediscovery of Bouguereau and his work. Throughout the course of his life, Bouguereau executed 822 known finished paintings, although the whereabouts of many are still unknown.\n\nWilliam-Adolphe Bouguereau was born in La Rochelle, France, on 30 November 1825, into a family of wine and olive oil merchants. The son of Théodore Bouguereau (born 1800) and Marie Bonnin (1804), known as Adeline, William was brought up a Catholic. He had an older brother, Alfred, and a younger sister, Marie (known as Hanna), who died when she was seven. The family moved to Saint-Martin-de-Ré in 1832. Another sibling was born in 1834, Kitty. At 12 the boy went to Mortagne to stay with his uncle Eugène, a priest, and developed a love of nature, religion and literature. In 1839 he was sent to study the priesthood at a Catholic college in Pons. Here he was taught to draw and paint by Louis Sage who had studied under Ingres. William reluctantly left his studies to return to his family, now residing in Bordeaux. Here the boy met a local artist, Charles Marionneau, and commenced at the Municipal School of Drawing and Painting in November, 1841. William also worked as a shop assistant, hand-colouring lithographs and making small paintings that were reproduced using chromolithography. He was soon the best pupil in his class and decided to become an artist in Paris. To fund the move, he sold portraits – 33 oils in three months. All were unsigned and only one has been traced. He arrived in Paris aged 20 in March 1846.\nBouguereau became a student at the École des Beaux-Arts. To supplement his formal training in drawing, he attended anatomical dissections and studied historical costumes and archeology. He was admitted to the studio of François-Édouard Picot, where he studied painting in the academic style. \"Dante and Virgil in Hell\" (1850) was an early example of his great, Neo-Classical works. Academic painting placed the highest status on historical and mythological subjects and Bouguereau won the coveted Prix de Rome at age 26 in 1850, with his \"Zenobia Found by Shepherds on the Banks of the Araxes\". His reward was a three-year residence at the Villa Medici in Rome, Italy, where in addition to formal lessons he was able to study first-hand the Renaissance artists and their masterpieces, as well as Greek, Etruscan, and Roman antiquities. He also studied classical literature, which influenced his subject choice for the rest of his career.\n\nIn April 1848 the young artist entered the Prix de Rome contest. Soon after work began there were riots in Paris and Bouguereau enrolled in the National Guard. After an unsuccessful attempt to win the prize, he entered again in 1849. Following 106 days of competition he again failed to win. His third attempt commenced in April 1850 and five months later he heard he had won a joint first prize. Along with other category winners, William set off for Rome in December and finally arrived at the Villa Medici in January 1851. He explored the city, making sketches and watercolours as he went. He walked to Naples and on to Capri, Amalfi and Pompeii. Still based in Rome and working hard on course work there were more explorations of Italy in 1852. Although the artist bore a strong admiration for all traditional art, he particularly revered Greek sculpture, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Michelangelo, Titian, Rubens and Delacroix. In April 1854 he left Rome and returned to La Rochelle.\n\nBouguereau, painting within the traditional academic style, exhibited at the annual exhibitions of the Paris Salon for his entire working life. An early reviewer stated, \"M. Bouguereau has a natural instinct and knowledge of contour. The eurythmie of the human body preoccupies him, and in recalling the happy results which, in this genre, the ancients and the artists of the sixteenth century arrived at, one can only congratulate M. Bouguereau in attempting to follow in their footsteps ... Raphael was inspired by the ancients ... and no one accused him of not being original.\"\n\nRaphael was a favourite of Bouguereau and he took this review as a high compliment. He had fulfilled one of the requirements of the Prix de Rome by completing an old-master copy of Raphael's \"The Triumph of Galatea\". In many of his works, he followed the same classical approach to composition, form, and subject matter. Bouguereau's graceful portraits of women were considered very charming, partly because he could beautify a sitter while also retaining her likeness.\n\nAlthough Bouguereau spent most of his life in Paris, he returned to La Rochelle again and again throughout his professional life. He was revered in the town of his birth, and undertook decorating commissions from local citizens. From the early 1870s William and his family spent every summer in La Rochelle. In 1882 he decided that rather than rent, he would purchase a house, as well as local farm buildings. By August 1882 the family's permanent summer base was on the rue Verdière. The artist would commence several paintings here and complete them in his Paris studio. He died in the town of his birth.\nBouguereau flourished after his Villa Medici residence. In 1854–55 he decorated a pavilion at the grand house of a cousin in Angoulins, including four large paintings of figures depicting the seasons. He was happy to undertake other commissions to pay off the debts accrued in Italy and to help his penniless mother. He decorated a mansion with nine large paintings of allegorical figures. In 1856 the Ministry of State for Fine Arts commissioned him to paint \"Emperor Napoleon III Visiting the Victims of the Tarascon Flood\". There were decorations for the chapel at Saint-Clotilde. On July 12, 1859 he was bestowed the Légion d'honneur. By this time William was turning away from history painting and lengthy commissions to work on more personal paintings, with realistic and rustic themes.\n\nBy the late 1850s, he had made strong connections with art dealers, particularly Paul Durand-Ruel (later the champion of the Impressionists), who helped clients buy paintings from artists who exhibited at the Salons. Thanks to Paul Durand-Ruel, Bouguereau met Hugues Merle, who later often was compared to Bouguereau. The Salons annually drew over 300,000 people, providing valuable exposure to exhibited artists. Bouguereau's fame extended to England by the 1860s. Three paintings were shown at the 1863 Salon and \"Holy Family\" was sold to Napoleon III, who presented it to his wife the Empress Eugénie, who hung it in her Tuileries apartment.\n\n\"Bather\" (1864), a shocking nude, was submitted to an exhibition in Ghent, Belgium. It was a spectacular success and purchased by the museum at great expense. At this time, William took on decorative work at the Grand Théâtre, Bordeaux, which lasted four years. In 1875, with assistants, he began work on a La Rochelle chapel ceiling, producing six paintings on copper over the next six years. Once installed in the city in summer 1875 he began \"Pietà\", one of his greatest religious paintings and shown at the 1876 Salon, in tribute to his son Georges. At the behest of William III of the Netherlands, Bouguereau went to the palace of Loo in May 1876. The king admired the artist and they spent intimate times together. In May 1878 the Paris Universal Exhibition opened to showcase French work. Bouguereau found and borrowed twelve of his paintings from their owners, including new work \"The Nymphaeum\".\nBouguereau was a staunch traditionalist whose genre paintings and mythological themes were modern interpretations of Classical subjects, both pagan and Christian, with a concentration on the naked female form. The idealized world of his paintings brought to life goddesses, nymphs, bathers, shepherdesses, and madonnas in a way that appealed to wealthy art patrons of the era.\n\nBouguereau employed traditional methods of working up a painting, including detailed pencil studies and oil sketches, and his careful method resulted in a pleasing and accurate rendering of the human form. His painting of skin, hands, and feet was particularly admired. He also used some of the religious and erotic symbolism of the Old Masters, such as the \"broken pitcher\" which connoted lost innocence.\n\nBouguereau received many commissions to decorate private houses and public buildings, and, early on, this added to his prestige and fame. As was typical of such commissions, Bouguereau would sometimes paint in his own style, and at other times conform to an existing group style. He also made reductions of his public paintings for sale to patrons, of which \"The Annunciation\" (1888) is an example. He was also a successful portrait painter and many of his paintings of wealthy patrons remain in private hands.\n\nFrom the 1860s, Bouguereau was closely associated with the Académie Julian where he gave lessons and advice to art students, male and female, from around the world. During several decades he taught drawing and painting to hundreds, if not thousands, of students. Many of them managed to establish artistic careers in their own countries, sometimes following his academic style, and in other cases, rebelling against it, like Henri Matisse. He married his most famous pupil, Elizabeth Jane Gardner, after the death of his first wife.\n\nBouguereau received many honors from the Academy: he became a Life Member in 1876; received the Grand Medal of Honour in 1885; was appointed Commander of the Legion of Honor in 1885; and was made Grand Officier of the Legion of Honour in 1905. He began to teach drawing at the Académie Julian in 1875, a co-ed art institution independent of the École des Beaux-Arts, with no entrance exams and nominal fees.\n\nIn 1856, William began living with one of his models, Nelly Monchablon, a 19-year-old from Lisle-en-Rigault. Living together out of wedlock, the pair kept their liaison a secret. Their first child, Henriette, was born in April 1857. Georges was born January 1859. A third child, Jeanne, was born 25 December 1861. The couple married quietly (for many assumed they were already wed) on 24 May 1866. Eight days later, Jeanne died from tuberculosis. In mourning, the couple went to La Rochelle, and Bouguereau made a painting of her in 1868. A fourth child, Adolphe (known as Paul), was born in October 1868. Aged 15, Georges' health suffered, and his mother took him away from the bad air of Paris. He died, however, on June 19, 1875. Nelly had a fifth child in 1876, Maurice, but her health was declining and the doctors suspected that she had contracted tuberculosis. His wife died on 3 April 1877, and baby Maurice died two months later.\n\nThe artist planned to marry Elizabeth Jane Gardner, a pupil whom he had known for ten years, but his mother was opposed to the idea. Soon after Nelly's death, she made William swear he would not remarry within her lifetime. After his mother's death, and after a nineteen-year engagement, William and Elizabeth married in Paris in June 1896. His wife continued to work as his private secretary and helped to organize the household staff. Tragically, his son Paul contracted tuberculosis in early 1899 and he, William, and his stepmother, went to Menton in the south. When the stay prolonged, William found a room in which to paint. Paul died at his father's house in April 1900 aged 32. William had outlived four of his five children. Elizabeth was with William to the end. She died in Paris in January 1922.\n\nWhen William arrived in Paris in March 1846 he resided at the Hotel Corneille at 5 rue Corneille. In 1855, after his stay in Rome, he lived at 27 rue de Fleurus, and the following year rented a fourth-floor studio at 3 rue Carnot near his apartment. In the year of his marriage to Nelly, 1866, he bought a vast plot of land on the rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs and an architect was commissioned to design a grand house with a top-floor studio. The family was installed in 1868, together with five servants and with his mother, Adeline, visiting daily. Bouguereau spent the rest of his life here and at La Rochelle.\n\nBouguereau was an assiduous painter, often completing twenty or more easel paintings in a single year. Even during the twilight years of his life, he would rise at dawn to work on his paintings six days a week and would continue painting until nightfall. Throughout the course of his lifetime, he is known to have painted at least 822 paintings. Many of these paintings have been lost. Near the end of his life he described his love of his art: \"Each day I go to my studio full of joy; in the evening when obliged to stop because of darkness I can scarcely wait for the next morning to come ... if I cannot give myself to my dear painting I am miserable.\"\n\nIn the spring of 1905, Bouguereau's house and studio in Paris were burgled. On 19 August 19, 1905, Bouguereau died in La Rochelle at the age of 79 from heart disease. There was an outpouring of grief in the town of his birth. After a Mass at the cathedral, his body was placed on a train to Paris for a second ceremony. Bouguereau was laid to rest with Nelly and his children at the family vault at Montparnasse Cemetery.\n\nIn his own time, Bouguereau was considered to be one of the greatest painters in the world by the academic art community, and simultaneously he was reviled by the avant-garde. He also gained wide fame in Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, and in the United States, and commanded high prices. His works often sold within days of completion. Some were viewed by international collectors and bought before work had even finished.\n\nBouguereau’s career was close to a direct ascent with hardly a setback. To many, he epitomized taste and refinement, and a respect for tradition. To others, he was a competent technician stuck in the past. Degas and his associates used the term \"Bouguereauté\" in a derogatory manner to describe any artistic style reliant on \"slick and artificial surfaces\", also known as a licked finish. In an 1872 letter, Degas wrote that he strove to emulate Bouguereau's ordered and productive working style, although with Degas' famous trenchant wit, and the aesthetic tendencies of the Impressionists, it is possible the statement was meant to be ironic. Paul Gauguin loathed him, rating him a round zero in \"Racontars de Rapin\" and later describing in \"Avant et après (Intimate Journals)\" the single occasion when Bouguereau made him smile on coming across a couple of his paintings in an Arles' brothel, \"where they belonged\".\n\nBouguereau's works were eagerly bought by American millionaires who considered him the most important French artist of that time. But even during his lifetime there was critical dissent in assessing his work; the art historian Richard Muther wrote in 1894 that Bouguereau was a man \"destitute of artistic feeling but possessing a cultured taste [who] reveals... in his feeble mawkishness, the fatal decline of the old schools of convention.\" In 1926, American art historian Frank Jewett Mather criticized the commercial intent of Bouguereau's work, writing that the artist \"multiplied vague, pink effigies of nymphs, occasionally draped them, when they became saints and madonnas, painted on the great scale that dominates an exhibition, and has had his reward. I am convinced that the nude of Bouguereau was prearranged to meet the ideals of a New York stockbroker of the black walnut generation.\" Bouguereau confessed in 1891 that the direction of his mature work was largely a response to the marketplace: \"What do you expect, you have to follow public taste, and the public only buys what it likes. That's why, with time, I changed my way of painting.\"\n\nAfter 1920, Bouguereau fell into disrepute, due in part to changing tastes. Comparing his work to that of his Realist and Impressionist contemporaries, Kenneth Clark faulted Bouguereau's painting for \"lubricity\", and characterized such Salon art as superficial, employing the \"convention of smoothed-out form and waxen surface.\"\n\nIn 1974, the New York Cultural Center staged a show of Bouguereau's work partly as a curiosity, although curator Robert Isaacson had his eye on the long-term rehabilitation of Bouguereau's legacy and reputation. In 1984, the Borghi Gallery hosted a commercial show of 23 oil paintings and one drawing. In the same year a major exhibition was organized by the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts in Canada. The exhibition opened at the Musée du Petit-Palais, in Paris, traveled to The Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, and concluded in Montréal. More recently, resurgence in the artist's popularity has been promoted by American collector Fred Ross, who owns a number of paintings by Bouguereau and features him on his website at Art Renewal Center.\n\nSince 1975 prices for Bouguereau's works have climbed steadily, with major paintings selling at high prices: $1,500,000 in 1998 for \"\", $2,600,000 in 1999 for \"\" and \"Charity\" at auction in May 2000 for $3,500,000. Bouguereau's works are in many public collections.\n\n\"Notre Dame des Anges\" (\"Our Lady of the Angels\") was last shown publicly in the United States at the World's Columbian Exhibition in Chicago in 1893. In 2002 it was donated to the Daughters of Mary Mother of Our Savior, an order of nuns affiliated with Clarence Kelly's Traditionalist Catholic Society of St. Pius V. In 2009 the nuns sold it to an art dealer for $450,000, who was able to sell it for more than $2 million. Kelly was subsequently found guilty by an Albany, New York jury of defaming the dealer in remarks made in a television interview.\nSources on his full name are contradictory: it is sometimes given as \"William-Adolphe Bouguereau\" (composed name), \"William Adolphe Bouguereau\" (usual and civil-only names according to the French tradition), while in other occasions it appears as \"Adolphe William Bouguereau\" (with Adolphe as the usual name). However, the artist used to sign his works simply as William Bouguereau (hinting \"William\" was his given name, whatever the order), or more precisely as \"W.Bouguereau.date\" (French alphabet) and later as \"W-BOVGVEREAV-date\" (Latin alphabet).\n\n\nIn Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novel \"The Sign of the Four\" (1890), the character Mr Sholto remarks, \"there cannot be the least question about the Bouguereau. I am partial to the modern French school.\"\n\n\n\n"}
