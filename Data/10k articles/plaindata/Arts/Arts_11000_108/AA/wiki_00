{"id": "6139311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6139311", "title": "1 euro coin", "text": "1 euro coin\n\nThe 1-euro coin (€1) is a euro coin with a value of one euro (€1). It is made of two alloys: the inner part of cupronickel, the outer part of nickel brass. All coins have a common reverse side and country-specific national sides. The coin has been used since 2002, with the present common side design dating from 2007.\n\nAs of July 2015, there were approximately 6.7 billion one-euro coins in circulation, constituting 26.4% of all circulated euro coins by value and 5.9% by quantity.\n\nThe coin dates from 2002, when euro coins and banknotes were introduced in the twelve-member Eurozone and its related territories. The common side was designed by Luc Luycx, a Belgian artist who won a Europe-wide competition to design the new coins. The design of the one and two euro coins was intended to show the European Union (EU) as a whole with the then 15 countries more closely joined together than on the 10- to 50-cent coins (the 1- to 5-cent coins showed the EU as one, though intending to show its place in the world).\n\nThere were then 15 versions of the national sides (eurozone + Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican who could mint their own) and in each case there was a national competition to decide the design, which had to comply with uniform specifications, such as the requirement to include twelve stars (see euro coins). National designs were not allowed to change until the end of 2008, unless a monarch (whose portrait usually appears on the coins) died or abdicated. This happened in Monaco and the Vatican City, resulting in three new designs in circulation (the Vatican had an interim \"sede vacante\" design until the new Pope was elected). National designs have seen some changes, as they are now required to include the name of the issuing country: previously neither Finland nor Belgium showed this. , Austria, Germany and Greece are obliged to change their designs due this requirement in the future.\n\nAs the EU's membership has since expanded in 2004 and 2007, with further expansions envisaged, the common face of all euro coins of values of 10 cents and above were redesigned in 2007 to show a new map. This map showed Europe, not just the EU, as one continuous landmass; however Cyprus was moved west as the map cut off after the Bosphorus (which was seen as excluding Turkey for political reasons). The 2007 redesign coincided with the first enlargement of the eurozone in that year, with the entry of Slovenia. Hence, the Slovenian design was added to the designs in circulation. Since then designs for Cyprus, Malta, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have been added as each of these states joined the eurozone. Andorra began minting its own designs in 2014 after winning the right to do so.\n\nThe coins are composed of two alloys. The inner circle is composed of three layers (copper-nickel, nickel, copper-nickel) and the outer ring of nickel brass, giving the coin a two-colour appearance. The coin has a diameter of 23.25 mm, thickness 2.33 mm and a mass of 7.5 grams. The coins' edges consist of alternating segments: three smooth, three finely ribbed. The coins have been used from 2002, though some are dated 1999, which is the year the euro was created as a currency, but not put into general circulation.\n\nThe reverse (used from 2007 onwards) was designed by Luc Luycx and displays a map of Europe, not including Iceland and cutting off, in a semicircle, at the Bosphorus, north through the middle of Ukraine, then Russia and through northern Scandinavia. Cyprus is located further west than it should be and Malta is shown disproportionately large so that it appears on the map. The map has numerous indentations giving an appearance of geography rather than a flat design. Six fine lines cut across the map except where there is landmass and have a star at each end—reflecting the twelve stars on the flag of Europe. Across the map is the word EURO, and a large number 1 appears to the left hand side of the coin. The designer's initials, LL, appear next to Cyprus.\n\nLuc Luycx designed the original coin, which was much the same except that the design was only of the then 15 members in their entirety and showing borders and no geographic features. The map was less detailed and the lines the stars were upon cut through where there would be landmass in eastern Europe if it were shown.\n\nThe obverse side of the coin depends on the issuing country. All have to include twelve stars (in most cases a circle around the edge), the engraver's initials and the year of issue. New designs also have to include the name or initials of the issuing country. The side cannot repeat the denomination of the coin unless the issuing country uses an alphabet other than Latin (currently, Greece is the only such country, hence \"1 ΕΥΡΩ\" is engraved upon its coin. Austria is currently in breach of the revised rules, but has so far not announced plans to remove \"1 EURO\" from its coin).\n\nAustria, Germany and Greece will at some point need to update their designs to comply with guidelines stating they must include the issuing state's name or initial, and not repeat the denomination of the coin.\n\nIn addition, there are several EU states that have not yet adopted the euro, some of them have already agreed upon their coin designs; however, it is not know exactly when they will adopt the currency, and hence these are not yet minted. See enlargement of the Eurozone for expected entry dates of these countries.\n\nOne-euro coins have been produced every year in Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands and Spain. In Austria, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Luxemburg, Portugal, San Marino and the Vatican City no €1 coins were minted dated 1999, 2000 and 2001. In Monaco, no €1 coins were minted in 1999, 2000, 2005, 2008 and 2010. Malta did not issue €1 coins in 2009. Slovenia and Slovakia have produced coins every year since their respective entries to the eurozone.\n\nProof €1 coins are minted by the majority, but not all, of the eurozone states.\n\nOne of the most valuable planned issues of a €1 coin was by Vatican City in 2002, which may sell for several hundred euros. However, the French mint marks were mistakenly not placed on some 2007 Monaco coins which are hence worth more than €200 to collectors.\n\nPP means the proof-condition coins.\nNumbers means if more than one coin was minted in that year in that condition by the country. In Germany, there are five mint marks, so they mint ten types of coins in every year. In Greece, there were coins in 2002 which were minted in Finland with S mint mark. In the Vatican, there were coins minted with John Paul II's effigy, and with \"Sede Vacante\" image in 2005.\n\nThere are several error 1-euro coins: Italian types from 2002 without mintmarks; Portuguese coins, also from 2002 with another type of edging (29 stripes instead of 28) and from 2008 with the first type of the common side, officially used until 2007; and the famous Monegasque coin from 2007 without mint marks.\n\n"}

The research titled \"Management and Visualisation of Non-linear History of Polygonal 3D Models\" was supervised by Prof Anthony Steed and Prof Niloy Mitra, and funded by EPSRC and Arup Foresight. Over the years, 3D Repo won a large number of awards and was involved in many high-profile public as well as private construction projects including London Olympic Stadium, Wood Wharf, Crossrail and Smart Motorways. 3D Repo also provides R&D and VR capability to large construction companies such as Balfour Beatty and Skanska. The lead investor behind the company is an early stage venture capital fund Sussex Place Ventures owned by London Business School. 3D Repo is an organizational member of British Computer Society, the Chartered Institute for IT. In 2015, 3D Repo was named one of top 20 tech innovators in the UK.\n\n3D Repo version control system—still in its early stages of doctoral research—was originally demonstrated at the joint SIGGRAPH and Web3D conference in Los Angeles, United States in August 2012 featuring the King's Cross Station Redevelopment project by Arup. Later that year, 3D Repo attended an invited lecture at German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) in Saarbrücken, Germany which led to a collaboration and development of the first REST API for the system. The front-end visualization was programmed in XML3D and was featured at Web3D 2013 in San Sebastián, Spain. The main scientific advancement was the introduction of externalized web 3D resources in various encodings that enabled interactivity and prevented web browsers from becoming unresponsive while loading very large 3D models over the Internet. SIGGRAPH Asia 2012 in Singapore also introduced a native Android application and the very first 3D differencing tool \"Interactive 3D Diff\". Subsequent collaboration with Prof Niloy Mitra at University College London led to the development of a reverse engineering system \"3D Timeline\" presented at Eurographics 2014 in Strasbourg, France. Unlike Interactive 3D Diff which required prior correspondence information, i.e. matching object-level identifiers between revisions, 3D Timeline reverse engineered the relationships and changes between 3D components over multiple revisions without prior correspondence.\n\nBased on the potential commercial impact of 3D Repo, the project was awarded VEIV Advance Scholarship in order to devise a business plan. This was nominated for the Royal Academy of Engineering ERA Foundation Entrepreneurs Award in December 2013. A commercial company was registered in April 2014 following the award of an Innovate UK Smart grant which also helped to secure initial angel funding. In the second half of 2014, the project was seconded to Balfour Beatty via the Breakthrough Information Technology Exchange programme applying the new technology to the London Olympic Stadium Transformation project. This led to the development and application of Virtual reality for health and safety training on the M5 Smart Motorway in the UK which was nominated for British Construction Industry Awards in 2017.\n\nIn 2015, 3D Repo was also invited to join the third cohort of Cognicity Challenge by Canary Wharf Group. The challenge consisted of an intensive twelve-week incubation programme designed to identify and solve construction problems faced by Canary Wharf in collaboration with Intel. The resulting Building Information Modeling platform 3drepo.io won the \"Virtual Design and Construction\" category, a £50,000 cash prize and a paid pilot deploying the solution to the Wood Wharf development. This enabled design coordination and federation of large 3D models via modern WebGL-enabled web browsers. The inner workings of the platform utilizing the X3DOM renderer developed in collaboration with Fraunhofer Institute were presented at the 20th anniversary Web3D conference in Heraklion, Greece. The platform was subsequently expanded with experimental streaming capability using glTF data format developed in collaboration with University College London. Further advanced cloud security provisions were developed in collaboration with British Telecom\n\nIn 2017, 3D Repo unveiled version 2.0 based on the Unity game engine. This technological interconnection received the Best Paper Award at Web3D 2017 in Brisbane, Australia.\n"}
{"id": "438953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=438953", "title": "4′33″", "text": "4′33″\n\n4′33″ (pronounced \"Four minutes, thirty-three seconds\" or just \"Four thirty-three\")<ref name=\"Solomon 1998/2002\">Solomon 1998/2002.</ref> is a three-movement composition by American experimental composer John Cage (1912–1992). It was composed in 1952, for any instrument or combination of instruments, and the score instructs the performer(s) not to play their instrument(s) during the entire duration of the piece throughout the three movements. The piece consists of the sounds of the environment that the listeners hear while it is performed, although it is commonly perceived as \"four minutes thirty-three seconds of silence\". The title of the piece refers to the total length in minutes and seconds of a given performance, \"4′33″\" being the total length of the first public performance.\n\nConceived around 1947–48, while the composer was working on \"Sonatas and Interludes\", \"4′33″\" became for Cage the epitome of his idea that any sounds may constitute music. It was also a reflection of the influence of Zen Buddhism, which Cage studied since the late 1940s. In a 1982 interview, and on numerous other occasions, Cage stated that \"4′33″\" was, in his opinion, his most important work. \"The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\" describes \"4′33″\" as Cage's \"most famous and controversial creation\".\n\nSilence played a major role in several of Cage's works composed before \"4′33″\". The \"Duet for Two Flutes\" (1934), composed when Cage was 22, opens with silence, and silence was an important structural element in some of the \"Sonatas and Interludes\" (1946–48), \"Music of Changes\" (1951) and \"Two Pastorales\" (1951). The \"Concerto for prepared piano and orchestra\" (1951) closes with an extended silence, and \"Waiting\" (1952), a piano piece composed just a few months before \"4′33″\", consists of long silences framing a single, short ostinato pattern. Furthermore, in his songs \"The Wonderful Widow of Eighteen Springs\" (1942) and \"A Flower\" (1950) Cage directs the pianist to play a closed instrument, which may be understood as a metaphor of silence.\n\nThe first time Cage mentioned the idea of a piece composed entirely of silence was during a 1947 (or 1948) lecture at Vassar College, \"A Composer's Confessions\". Cage told the audience that he had \"several new desires\", one of which was\nto compose a piece of uninterrupted silence and sell it to Muzak Co. It will be three or four-and-a-half minutes long—those being the standard lengths of \"canned\" music and its title will be \"Silent Prayer\". It will open with a single idea which I will attempt to make as seductive as the color and shape and fragrance of a flower. The ending will approach imperceptibility.\nAt the time, however, Cage felt that such a piece would be \"incomprehensible in the Western context,\" and was reluctant to write it down: \"I didn't wish it to appear, even to me, as something easy to do or as a joke. I wanted to mean it utterly and be able to live with it.\" Painter Alfred Leslie recalls Cage presenting a \"one-minute-of-silence talk\" in front of a window during the late 1940s, while visiting Studio 35 at New York University.\n\nIn 1951, Cage visited the anechoic chamber at Harvard University. An anechoic chamber is a room designed in such a way that the walls, ceiling and floor absorb all sounds made in the room, rather than reflecting them as echoes. Such a chamber is also externally sound-proofed. Cage entered the chamber expecting to hear silence, but he wrote later, \"I heard two sounds, one high and one low. When I described them to the engineer in charge, he informed me that the high one was my nervous system in operation, the low one my blood in circulation.\" Cage had gone to a place where he expected total silence, and yet heard sound. \"Until I die there will be sounds. And they will continue following my death. One need not fear about the future of music.\" The realization as he saw it of the impossibility of silence led to the composition of \"4′33″\".\n\nAnother cited influence for this piece came from the field of the visual arts. Cage's friend and sometimes colleague Robert Rauschenberg had produced, in 1951, a series of white paintings, seemingly \"blank\" canvases (though painted with white house paint) that in fact change according to varying light conditions in the rooms in which they were hung, the shadows of people in the room and so on. This inspired Cage to use a similar idea, as he later stated, \"Actually what pushed me into it was not guts but the example of Robert Rauschenberg. His white paintings [...] when I saw those, I said, 'Oh yes, I must. Otherwise I'm lagging, otherwise music is lagging'.\" In an introduction to an article called On Robert Rauschenberg, Artist, and His Works, John Cage writes \"To Whom It May Concern: The white paintings came first; my silent piece came later.\"\n\nCompositions that, like \"4′33″\", include no sounds produced by the performer, were conceived by a number of composers and writers before Cage. Examples include the following:\n\nThe musicologist Richard Taruskin has argued that \"4′33″\" is an example of automatism. Since the Romantic Era composers have been striving to produce music that could be separated from any social connections, transcending the boundaries of time and space. In automatism, composers wish to completely remove both the composers and the artist from the process of creation. This is motivated by the belief that what we think of as \"self-expression\" is really just an infusion of the art with the social standards that we have been subjected to since birth. Therefore, the only way to achieve truth is to remove the artist from the process of creation. Cage achieves that by employing chance (e.g., use of the \"I Ching\", or tossing coins) to make compositional decisions. In \"4′33″\", neither artist nor composer has any impact on the piece, so that Cage has no way of controlling what ambient sounds will be heard by the audience.\n\nThe premiere of the three-movement \"4′33″\" was given by David Tudor on August 29, 1952, in Maverick Concert Hall, Woodstock, New York, as part of a recital of contemporary piano music. The audience saw him sit at the piano and, to mark the beginning of the piece, close the keyboard lid. Some time later he opened it briefly, to mark the end of the first movement. This process was repeated for the second and third movements.\n\nThe piece remains controversial to this day, and is seen as challenging the very definition of music.\n\nIn defining noise music and its value, Paul Hegarty in \"Noise/Music: A History\" (2007) contends that Cage's \"4′33″\" represents the beginning of noise music proper. For Hegarty, noise music, as with \"4′33″\", is that music made up of incidental sounds that represent perfectly the tension between \"desirable\" sound (properly played musical notes) and undesirable \"noise\" that make up all noise music.\n\n\"4′33″\" challenges, or rather exploits to a radical extent, the social regiments of the modern concert life etiquette, experimenting on unsuspecting concert-goers to prove an important point. First, the choice of a prestigious venue and the social status of the composer and the performers automatically heightens audience's expectations for the piece. As a result, the listener is more focused, giving Cage's \"4′33″\" the same amount of attention (or perhaps even more) as if it were Beethoven's Ninth. Thus, even before the performance, the reception of the work is already predetermined by the social setup of the concert. Furthermore, the audience's behavior is limited by the rules and regulation of the concert hall; they will quietly sit and listen to 4′33” of ambient noise. It is not easy to get a large group of people to listen to ambient noise for nearly five minutes, unless they are regulated by the concert hall etiquette.\n\nThe second point made by \"4′33″\" concerns duration. According to Cage, duration is the essential building block of all of music. This distinction is motivated by the fact that duration is the only element shared by both silence and sound. As a result, the underlying structure of any musical piece consists of an organized sequence of \"time buckets\". They could be filled with either sounds, silence or noise; where neither of these elements is absolutely necessary for completeness. In the spirit of his teacher Schoenberg, Cage managed to emancipate the silence and the noise to make it an acceptable or perhaps even integral part of his music composition. \"4′33″\" serves as a radical and extreme illustration of this concept, asking that if the time buckets are the only necessary parts of the musical composition, then what stops the composer from filling them with no intentional sounds?\n\nThe third point is that the work of music is defined not only by its content but also by the behavior it elicits from the audience. In the case of Stravinsky's \"Rite of Spring\", this would consist of widespread dissatisfaction leading up to violent riots. In Cage's \"4′33″\", the audience felt cheated by having to listen to no composed sounds from the performer. Nevertheless, in \"4′33″\" the audience contributed the bulk of the musical material of the piece. Since the piece consists of exclusively ambient noise, the audience's behavior, their whispers and movements, are essential elements that fill the above-mentioned time buckets.\n\nIn a 2013 TED Talk, philosophy professor Julian Dodd argues that \"4′33″\" is witty conceptual art, but does not meet the criteria for it to count as music, instead challenging the listener to question what the nature of music is. In a 2013 TED Talk, psychologist Paul Bloom puts forward \"4′33″\" as one example to show that knowing about the origin of something influences our opinion about it as \"that silence is different from other forms of silence\".\n\nSeveral versions of the score exist: There are four known later versions, one of which is in the New York Public Library.\n\nThere is some discrepancy between the lengths of individual movements of the premiere performance, specified in different versions of the score. The Woodstock printed program specifies the lengths 30″, 2′23″ and 1′40″, as does the Kremen manuscript, and presumably the original manuscript had the same indications. However, in the \"First Tacet Edition\" Cage writes that at the premiere the timings were 33″, 2′40″ and 1′20″. In the \"Second Tacet Edition\" he adds that after the premier a copy has been made for Irwin Kremen, in which the lengths of the movements were 30″, 2′23″ and 1′40″. The causes of this discrepancy are not currently understood, the original manuscript being still lost.\n\nIn 1962, Cage wrote 0′00″, which is also referred to as 4′33″ No. 2. The directions originally consisted of one sentence: \"In a situation provided with maximum amplification, perform a disciplined action.\" At the first performance Cage had to write that sentence.\n\nThe second performance added four new qualifications to the directions: \"the performer should allow any interruptions of the action, the action should fulfill an obligation to others, the same action should not be used in more than one performance, and should not be the performance of a musical composition.\"\n\nIn late 1989, three years before his death, Cage revisited the idea of \"4′33″\" one last time. He composed \"One\", the full title of which is \"One = 4′33″ (0′00″) + \". As in all number pieces, \"One\" refers to the number of performers required. The score instructs the performer to build a sound system in the concert hall, so that \"the whole hall is on the edge of feedback, without actually feeding back.\" The content of the piece is the electronically amplified sound of the hall and the audience.\n\n\"4′33″\" has been recorded on several occasions: Frank Zappa recorded it as part of \"A Chance Operation: The John Cage Tribute\", on the Koch label, 1993; in 2002, James Tenney performed \"4′33″\" at Rudolf Schindler's historic Kings Road House in celebration of the work's 50th anniversary.\n\nSeveral performances of \"4′33″\" including a \"techno remix\" by New Waver were broadcast on Australian radio station ABC Classic FM, as part of a program exploring \"sonic responses\" to Cage's work. The Swedish electronic band Covenant concluded their 2000 album \"United States of Mind\" with a rendition of \"4′33″\" entitled \"You Can Make Your Own Music\".\n\nOn January 16, 2004, at the Barbican Centre in London, the BBC Symphony Orchestra gave the UK's first orchestral performance of this work. The performance was broadcast live on BBC Radio 3, and one of the main challenges was that the station's emergency backup systems are designed to switch on and play music whenever apparent silence (dead air) lasting longer than a preset duration is detected. They had to be switched off for this performance.\n\nA tongue-in-cheek version was recorded by the staff of the UK \"Guardian\" newspaper on January 16, 2004.\n\nIn 2004, the work was voted to be number 40 in the ABC radio's Classic 100 piano countdown.\n\nA silence of four minutes and thirty-three seconds appears as the penultimate track of the 2009 Living Colour album The Chair in the Doorway.\n\nOn December 5, 2010, an international simultaneous performance of Cage's \"4′33″\" took place involving over 200 performers, amateur and professional musicians, and artists. The global orchestra, conducted live by Bob Dickinson, former member of post-punk group Magazine, via video link, performed the piece in support of the Cage Against The Machine campaign to bring \"4′33″\" to Christmas number 1 in 2010. A second performance took place on December 12, 2010.\n\nOn November 17, 2015, \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" uploaded a video of this piece being performed by a cat, showing that its performer isn't required to be human.\n\nIn the week leading up to Christmas 2010, a Facebook page was created to encourage people in the UK to buy a new rendition of \"4′33″\" in the hope that it would prevent the winner of the seventh series of \"The X Factor\" from topping the UK Singles Chart and achieving the Christmas number one. The page was inspired by an earlier campaign in which a Facebook page set up by Jon and Tracey Morter prompted people to buy \"Killing in the Name\" by American rap metal protest group Rage Against the Machine in the week before Christmas 2009, and has therefore been dubbed \"Cage Against the Machine\". The creators of the Facebook page hoped that reaching number one would help to promote the piece and \"make December 25 'a silent night'.\" , the Facebook page has over 65,000 likes.\n\nThe campaign received support from several celebrities. It first came into prominence after it was mentioned by British science writer Ben Goldacre on his Twitter profile. Within two weeks, British newspaper \"The Sun\" reported that the Facebook page had been backed by more than 3,000 members. One of several similar campaigns, the Facebook page was called \"the only effort this year with a hope of [reaching Number One]\" by \"The Guardian\" journalist Tom Ewing in September. XFM DJ Eddy Temple-Morris also voiced his support on his blog, as did Luke Bainbridge. This version of Cage's work failed to make number 1, but charted at number 21 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\n\n\n\nAudio\n\nApp\n"}
{"id": "8448301", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8448301", "title": "A Family Thing", "text": "A Family Thing\n\nA Family Thing is a 1996 film starring Robert Duvall, James Earl Jones and Irma P. Hall. It was written by Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson and directed by Richard Pearce.\n\nThe film is a drama about a Scotch-Irish American Southerner (Duvall) named Earl Pilcher, whose late mother makes a shocking revelation in a letter that is given to him after her death. She reveals that Earl's biological mother was a Black American maid named Willa Mae, who was raped by Earl's (white) father and that she died while giving birth to Earl. His adoptive mother's dying wish is that he go to Chicago to meet his half-brother, Raymond Murdock (Jones). \n\nEarl initially takes the unexpected news of his mixed parentage badly, tearfully challenging his father to confirm the facts in the letter. Old and feeble, his father refuses to discuss the letter, but admits it is true. As a result, Earl packs up his clothes and takes off for Chicago to find his brother. \n\nHe meets Ray at city hall (where Ray works as a police officer) and Ray, although he really wants nothing to do with Earl, agrees to meet him for lunch at a diner. \n\nDuring lunch, Ray reveals that he knew all along that he had a half white brother and that he hates Earl's father (and Earl too by association) because he feels Earl's birth is what killed his mother. He says in so many words that he doesn't want or need a brother, and they go their separate ways. But when Earl leaves and drives off in his truck he encounters four black Chicago street toughs who rear end his truck. When Earl gets out to survey the (minimal) damage, he, being a trusting Southern \"good ol' boy\", leaves his keys in the ignition. The toughs beat him up and steal his truck and his wallet. He walks around in a daze and ends up in a hospital. The hospital staff finds Ray's information in Earl's pocket and calls Ray. He comes reluctantly, and the doctor tells him that Earl may have a concussion and needs to take it easy for a couple of days; no traveling is allowed. She also tells him that the hospital is full, so he will have to take Earl home to recuperate. \n\nAt Ray's home, Earl meets Aunt T (Hall), a kind and generous elderly woman who is blind. Aunt T. is Willa Mae's sister, and thus, Earl's aunt. \n\nEarl also meets Ray's son, Virgil (Beach), a surly and hostile city bus driver who doesn't appreciate a white southerner sleeping in his bed. At first, Earl's stay at the Murdoch residence is rocky. \n\nRay explains that Earl is an old war buddy whose life he saved, but Virgil is skeptical. During a grocery shopping excursion with Earl, Aunt T reveals that she knows who Earl really is.\n\nIn a powerful scene, Aunt T scolds Ray and Virgil for not welcoming a member of their family, no matter how different he is. Earl overhears the discussion and leaves Ray's house, walking unknowingly into a bad part of town.\n\nRay gives in to Aunt T's wish that he welcome Earl into their home, and he quickly locates him on a nearby street. Earl obstinately refuses to come back with Ray, knowing he is not wanted. The two argue, ending up in an awkward wrestling match, and Earl uses the word \"nigger\" to punctuate his disdain for Ray, seeing too late that he has gone too far. Angry at Earl's callous words, Ray tells Earl to stay away from him, and he heads back home.\n\nMeanwhile, Earl wanders Chicago and gets drunk at a Chicago bar, where he is tossed out for bothering a black couple. He ends up sleeping under a bridge. The next day, Ray has cooled down and, again on Aunt T.'s wishes, manages to find Earl, who apologizes for his words and rude behavior. The two begin to settle their differences. \n\nWhen Virgil's estranged wife (played by Regina Taylor) and their two daughters visit, Earl learns that Virgil had a promising career in football that was shattered by an injury in college. Virgil cannot cope with the missed opportunities caused by his injury, and, the resulting bitterness has hurt his relationship with his family.\n\nRay and Earl bond together more as they find similarities between them. Both served in the military (Earl as a firefighter in the United States Navy, and Ray in the U.S. Marines) during the Korean War, where they received lifelong scars.\n\nRay reveals that as a child, he once threw a rock at Earl that could have blinded him, because of Ray's hatred towards Earl's father.\n\nLater on, in a bar, Earl takes Virgil aside and explains to him that by dwelling on the loss of his football career, he isn't devoting himself to his wife and children in the way he should. Both of them begin to have a grudging respect for the other.\n\nOnce Earl is ready to go home, and the police unexpectedly find his truck operational (it was shot up in a bank robbery), Aunt T. sits Earl and Ray down to tell them the dramatic tale of the night Earl was born and Willa Mae died.\n\nAccording to Aunt T., Willa Mae knew she was likely to die and Earl's life was saved only by the quick action of his adoptive mother, Carrie, who brought a white doctor to the shack where Willa Mae and Ray lived to help with the delivery.\n\nAunt T speculates that Carrie and Willa Mae agreed that Earl, who was born with white-appearing features, should be raised by Carrie and his biological father. Aunt T. gives Earl a picture of Willa Mae which he keeps near. Earl begins to accept his new family with pride, and he convinces Ray to return to their Arkansas hometown to find their mother's grave.

It houses one of the largest and most important print rooms in the world with approximately 65,000 drawings and approximately 1 million old master prints, as well as more modern graphic works, photographs and architectural drawings. Apart from the graphics collection the museum has recently acquired on permanent loan two significant collections of Impressionist and early 20th-century art, some of which will be on permanent display. The museum also houses temporary exhibitions.\n\nThe Albertina was erected on one of the last remaining sections of the fortifications of Vienna, the Augustinian Bastion. Originally, the Hofbauamt (Court Construction Office), which had been built in the second half of the 17th century, stood in that location. In 1744 it was refurbished by the director of the Hofbauamt, Emanuel Teles Count Silva-Tarouca, to become his palace; it was therefore also known as \"Palais Taroucca\". The building was later taken over by Duke Albert of Saxen-Teschen who used it as his residence. He later brought his graphics collection there from Brussels, where he had acted as the governor of the Habsburg Netherlands. He had the building extended by Louis Montoyer. Since then, the palace has immediately bordered the Hofburg. The collection was expanded by Albert's successors.\n\nThe collection was created by Duke Albert with the Genoese count Giacomo Durazzo, the Austrian ambassador in Venice. In 1776 the count presented nearly 1,000 pieces of art to the duke and his wife Maria Christina (Maria Theresa's daughter). Count Durazzo, who was the brother of Marcello Durazzo, the Doge of Genoa – \"wanted to create a collection for posterity that served higher purposes than all others: education and the power of morality should distinguish his collection...\" \nIn the 1820s Archduke Charles, Duke Albert and Maria Christina's foster son, initiated further modifications to the building by Joseph Kornhäusel, which affected mostly its interior decoration. After Archduke Charles, his son Archduke Albrecht then Albrecht's nephew Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen lived in the building.\n\nIn early 1919, ownership of both the building and the collection passed from the Habsburgs to the newly founded Republic of Austria. In 1920 the collection of prints and drawings was united with the collection of the former imperial court library. The name Albertina was established in 1921. \n\nIn March 1945, the Albertina was heavily damaged by Allied bomb attacks. The building was rebuilt in the years after the war and was completely refurbished and modernized from 1998 to 2003. Modifications of the exterior entrance sequence, including a signature roof by Hans Hollein were completed 2008, when also the graphics collection finally reopened.\n\n"}

{"id": "192011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=192011", "title": "Artist's proof", "text": "Artist's proof\n\nAn artist's proof is, at least in theory, an impression of a print taken in the printmaking process to see the current printing state of a plate while the plate (or stone, or woodblock) is being worked on by the artist. A proof may show a clearly incomplete image, often called a \"working proof\" or \"trial impression\", but in modern practice is usually used to describe an impression of the finished work that is identical to the numbered copies. There can also be \"printer's proofs\" which are taken for the printer to see how the image is printing, or are final impressions the printer is allowed to keep; but normally the term \"artist's proof\" would cover both cases.\n\nArtist's proofs are not included in the count of a limited edition, and sometimes the number of artist's proofs, which belong to the artist, can be twenty or more. By convention, the artist is not supposed to sell these at once.\n\nThe term \"proof\" is generally, but not consistently, applied only to prints from the late eighteenth-century onwards, beginning with the English mezzotinters, who began the practice of issuing small editions of proofs for collectors, often before the \"lettering\" or inscription below the image was added. The practices of signing or numbering impressions in the main edition had not begun, and in the absence of this, it is normally only when the image is clearly different from the final form that the term proof has any meaning.\n\nIn old master prints, a proof will be described as belonging to a different state of the print. States are numbered I, II, III etc., in the sequence they were produced, which can normally be determined.\n\nFor example, Rembrandt, who had his own printing-press and printed at least the earliest copies of his etchings himself, was a great taker of proofs, but these are normally described as different states - his record was nine for one etching, although this involved returning to an older print he had sold many copies of, and largely reworking it.\n\nBut the term proof can be used in the case of a clear working proof of an old master print, like the two impressions of Albrecht Dürer's \"Adam and Eve\" (1504, British Museum and Albertina, Vienna) which show the figures largely finished but the background with only the main outlines lightly done.\n\nArt historians, curators, and collectors view working proofs as especially desirable because of their rarity, the insight they may give into the progress of the work, and because they may well have belonged to the artist. Especially in the case of dead artists, they can be the only evidence of the artist's incremental development of an image, something not usually available with drawings, paintings, or sculpture. Some lithographs may be hand signed in the border and labeled \"Epreuve D'Artiste\", which means Artist's Proof, which also increases its value.\n\nCollectors also usually prefer final artist's proofs even when they are identical to the main edition; if nothing else the print may have been presented to a friend by the artist. Prints are generally sold as limited editions, with a print being cheaper than a drawing or painting because the artist/gallery makes more money by selling multiples. An artist's proof has special value because of its extra rarity and its possible differences from the \"standard\" print, factors that are often reflected in its price.\n\nSince many printmaking processes require expensive equipment, most artists choose to work with specialist printers. The print shop provides technicians skilled in the process; the artist provides the art. It is customary in these cases to pay the technicians with a signed artist's proof, in addition to his wages. The print shop will also retain a proof, normally signed off as \"bon à tirer\" (\"good for printing\" in French) to use as a control example against which the other impressions are compared. This has resulted in some very impressive collections of prints owned by printmakers themselves.\n\nAn artist's proof is also known as a \"comp\" or \"complimentary\" if given to printers.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13051327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13051327", "title": "Associated American Artists", "text": "Associated American Artists\n\nAssociated American Artists (AAA) was an art gallery in New York City that was established in 1934 and ceased operation in 2000. The gallery marketed art to the middle and upper-middle classes, first in the form of affordable prints and later in home furnishings and accessories, and played a significant role in the growth of art as an industry.\n\nAssociated American Artists was begun by Reeves Lewenthal. Lewenthal's first job was as a reporter for the \"Chicago Tribune\" but he quickly expanded into artists' agent, working as a publicist for British artist Douglas Chandor. By the 1930s Lewenthal had a clientele of 35 groups including the National Academy of Design and the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design. Realizing the limited possibilities in selling high-priced art to high-class dealers, and the correspondingly huge potential in marketing affordable art to the much larger middle classes, he left his public relations work to try his hand at this new business model.\n\nPrints being relatively cheap to produce, Lewenthal decided to focus on that medium. Before the 1930s, fine-art prints were usually limited editions which sold for $10–$50. During the Great Depression the Federal Art Project had resulted in hundreds of thousands of prints, but these were distributed free (mostly to schools) thus the artists made no profits from print sales. Lewenthal's idea was to combine quality, affordability, and profit. In 1934 he met with several well-known American artists, including Thomas Hart Benton, and proposed hiring them to produce lithographs which he would then sell to middle-class buyers for $5 apiece plus $2 per frame, paying the artist $200 per edition. At the same time, corporations began hiring famous artists to work on advertising campaigns – Dole Pineapple, for example, hired artist Georgia O'Keeffe to \"create pictorial links between pineapple juice and tropical romance\". This convergence of art, business, and consumerism was the perfect environment for Lewenthal's new Associated American Artists enterprise.\n\nWhen Lewenthal commissioned his first lithographs in 1934, the American economy was still limping towards recovery from the Depression; high-priced art was an impossible luxury for most people and the old galleries that had always supported artists were finding it difficult to broker their work. AAA was thus \"an agent of economic salvation\" for numerous American artists including Peggy Bacon, Aaron Bohrod, John Steuart Curry, Luigi Lucioni, and Grant Wood, despite the fact that signing with AAA usually meant being fired from their higher-end gallery.\n\nBy the fall of 1934 Lewenthal had contracts with fifty department stores to carry his \"signed originals by America's great artists.\" \n\nLewenthal marketed his prints as educational resources, as a patriotic choice, and as \"art for the people\" rather than \"art for the wealthy.\" In January 1935 AAA issued its first mail-order print catalogue; mail-order print sales will continue for the next forty-nine years. He also placed advertisements in magazines such as \"Time\" and \"Reader's Digest\", and by promoting print collecting in terms of upward mobility—in the same way as buying Listerine (\"The Dentifrice of the Rich,\" according to one ad campaign), owning modern art raised one's life socially. AAA's success led them to open a 30,000-square-foot gallery at 711 Fifth Avenue in 1939 where they featured paintings and sculpture. In 1944, AAA had 107 artists under contract and sold 62,374 lithographs, for a net income of $1 million per month.\n\nIn addition to its mainstream marketing strategy, AAA chose art and artists with populist appeal. Representational and regional art made up the bulk of their lines; particularly popular were the works of Benton, Curry and Wood. These artists avoided gritty realism and created positive images of an idealized, strong, capable America, a viewpoint which accorded well with the political environment of the New Deal and was in some senses therapeutic for the anxiety and weakness pervasive during and just after the Depression. Typical of this was Benton's \"Plowing It Under\", released shortly after the federal government arranged the plowing under of millions of acres previously devoted to cotton production in order to increase farm revenue; Benton's work reassured the public that the government was working in the best interests of the people.\n\nThe Regionalists by and large were in favor of businesses and advertising using their works, believing that fine art could raise the consciousness of business. They did not fully realize how art figured into corporate branding and advertising in the minds of corporate planners, or consider that their art might be used to inspire confidence in a product. They were soon to learn. Benton's original works for R.J. Reynolds' Lucky Strikes, for example, showed black sharecroppers at work, but corporate headquarters were not interested in \"Negroes doing what looked like old-time slave work.\" They demanded pictures that showed not realism but idealism, leading Benton to complain that \"Every time a patron dictates to an artist what is to be done, he doesn't get any art, he just gets a poor commercial job.\" Increasingly, rather than deal with AAA and its artists, companies built in-house art departments that could produce art in the Regionalist style. This appropriation of the regionalist/representational style culminated in the propaganda posters of World War II.\n\nThe increasing association of regionalist and representational art with commercialism and advertising (and in some eyes, with fascism) contributed to its decreasing popularity and to the rise of abstract and surrealist art after World War II. When AAA opened galleries in Chicago and Beverly Hills, it stocked them with modern works by American and—a first for AAA—European artists. (When Lewenthal offered Jackson Pollock an art-for-business commission like those he had offered his artists in 1934, Pollock turned him down.) In its press releases and articles AAA talked about exploring \"new frontiers,\" \"new trends\" -- and made no mention of the $5 mail-order line and the artists who had helped it succeed twenty years earlier. Thomas Hart Benton resigned from AAA in 1946.\n\nAAA continued to find new ways to sell art, however, branching out into Stonelain porcelain, fabric, and housewares such as ashtrays, playing cards, and lamp shades as vehicles for work in abstract and other modern styles. By the mid-1950s, Lewenthal was quoted as saying, \"Today's artist is a designer, not an Ivory Tower tenant. His is a field of practical creativity and every American room can become a showcase for his genius.\". Now, rather than bringing modern art to the masses, AAA was bringing mass consumer commodities into the world of art.\n\nAAA was a victim of its own success in some ways. Having been so successful, it was adopted as a model by other companies that began to compete with AAA—marketing fabric, for example, as \"etching by the yard\" or commissioning artists to do designs for lines of china or wallpaper. Steubenville China marketed its \"American Modern\" line of place settings as \"art translated into dinnerware.\" In 1958 Lewenthal took over management of Rust Craft Greeting Cards, handling all AAA's decorative arts lines, while Sylvan Cole took responsibility for the New York gallery and the fine art market.\n\nIn a strange reversal of its \"market to the masses\" philosophy, many early AAA prints which sold originally for $5 go to art collectors for thousands of dollars today.\n\n\n\n"}

As pointed out by Eco (1993), Gaelic was thus argued to be the only instance of a language that overcame the confusion of tongues, being the first language that was created after the fall of the tower by the seventy-two wise men of the school of Fenius, choosing all that was best in each language to implement in Irish. Calder notes (p. xxxii) that the poetic list of the \"72 races\" was taken from a poem by Luccreth moccu Chiara.\n\nThe \"Auraicept\" is one of the three main sources of the manuscript tradition about Ogham, the others being \"In Lebor Ogaim\" and \"De dúilib feda na forfed\". A copy of \"In Lebor Ogaim\" immediately precedes the \"Auraincept\" in the Book of Ballymote, but instead of the \"Bríatharogam Con Culainn\" given in other copies, there follows a variety of other \"secret\" modes of ogham. The Younger Futhark are also included, as\" ogam lochlannach\" \"ogham of the Norsemen\".\n\nSimilar to the argument of the precedence of the Gaelic language, the \"Auraicept\" claims that Fenius Farsaidh discovered four alphabets, the Hebrew, Greek and Latin ones, and finally the ogham, and that the ogham is the most perfected because it was discovered last. The text is the origin of the tradition that the ogham letters were named after trees, but it gives as an alternative possibility that the letters are named for the 25 members of Fenius' school.\n\nIn the translation of Calder (1917),\n\nIn the translation of McManus:\n\n\n"}

The film, a joint Russian-Ukrainian production, was released in both countries on April 2, 2015; its international premiere took place two weeks later at the Beijing International Film Festival.\n\nHistorically speaking, the movie revolves around the events of the siege of Odessa and the siege of Sevastopol.\n\nThe film is directed by Sergey Mokritskiy and stars Yulia Peresild as Pavlichenko. In addition to Beijing, where Peresild was awarded Best Actress award, the film has also appeared at Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe film opens and closes with post-war scenes from the perspective of Eleanor Roosevelt (Joan Blackham) as she visits the protagonist Lyudmila Pavlichenko (Yulia Peresild) during the former first lady's 1957 trip to the Soviet Union. Pavlichenko's story is told through flashbacks to 1942 when Pavlichenko toured the United States with Roosevelt, and further flashbacks to Pavlichenko's experiences in the Soviet Union. After the German invasion of the USSR, university student Pavlichenko becomes a sniper in the 25th Rifle Division. She fights in the Battle of Odessa and, eventually, the defense of Sevastopol. After 309 confirmed kills, she is sent to the United States to campaign for American support. Eleanor Roosevelt invites her to the White House, and the two become friends.\n\nIn 1941, Lyudmila is a student who has just gotten into university; to celebrate, she goes to a shooting range with her friends including a classmate named Masha, doing exceptionally well despite never have shot before. At home, her father shows no pride in her, having desired a son who could become a soldier. In a twist of events, her perfect shooting results at the range eventually result in the military contacting her for a sharpshooting program, as Germany has just invaded the Soviet Union. Though a doctor courting her, Boris, tells her she should stay with him, she rejects what she perceives as cowardice and leaves to fight on the Eastern Front.\n\nDuring training, Lyudmila is shown as an excellent sniper, and eventually is partnered with a grizzled veteran named Makarov, who she falls in love with. He doesn't return her affections, however, and explains that he had lost his wife and family when the Germans invaded. She is also reunited with Masha, who is now a nurse engaged with a young pilot. During battle defending the city of Odessa, she is injured and Makarov drags her to safety to a local hospital, where Boris has volunteered as a military doctor. After awakening, Lyudmila manages to get Boris to sign her papers so that she can return to the frontlines, but finds out that Makarov has died in battle and the Soviets are retreating to Sevastopol.\n\nShe is paired with another superior, Leonid, and begins to show signs of trauma, showing signs of cruelty by shooting enemy soldiers to wound them and watch them suffer, rather than kill them instantly. Thus, their relationship starts off rough, but they eventually develop a close romance. Masha invites them to her wedding, but at the wedding reveals that her fiance had died, leaving her alone. This leads Lyudmila to tell Leonid privately that she wants a son.\n\nWhile on patrol in a field, Leonid steps on a mine that triggers a flare. Immediately, artillery shells begin to pummel the field, and Leonid shelters her from them with his body. Lyudmila again wakes up in a hospital, where Boris tells her Leonid has died. Though in a broken state, she is ordered to kill a top enemy sniper for propaganda purposes. The duel takes all of a day, and, tired of waiting, Lyudmila steps out of cover, exposing herself completely. She is shot, but manages to pinpoint the enemy sniper's location and kills him.\n\nBoris eventually is able to pull her away from battle. As the city is being evacuated, Boris carries a traumatized Lyudmila to a submarine that is evacuating the city. As panicked civilians attempt to board evacuating ships, Lyudmila realizes that Boris isn't coming with her, as he gave her his ticket. A voiceover by Eleanor Roosevelt reveals that Boris, Masha, and countless civilians and soldiers died defending the city from the Germans.\n\nRoosevelt later visits Lyudmila after the war, where she is now a mother. They attend the opera together, with Lyudmila's son.\n\nThe filming began in 2012 after the first archive material devoted to Pavlichenko was examined. Serhiy Mokrytskyi, who is better known as a cinematographer, served as director; after his arrival, the plot was altered to more closely match Pavlichenko's life. During production, there was concern of the growing political tension between Russia and Ukraine.\nHowever, the film was successfully released in both countries on the same day, in each country's own respective language.\n\nThe movie grossed RUB 435,468,256 ($8,702,274) in the Russian box office against a budget of RUB 124,000,000 and hence was a commercial success.\n\n"}

The film follows the wives from their introduction to the polygamous lifestyle to the emotional hardships and jealousies to their struggle for empowerment and equal rights.\n\n\"Bitter Honey\" was directed by Robert Lemelson, an anthropologist and filmmaker with a doctorate from UCLA. Lemelson had originally been researching the 1998 mass rapes perpetrated during the economic crisis and the fall of the Suharto regime. Realizing that these acts were only one piece of the larger puzzle of gender inequality in Indonesia, Lemelson shifted his focus to domestic violence and particularly how it coincided with polygamous kinship forms. The film’s title refers to a regional play on words, as the local term for co-wife (\"madu\") also translates to “honey.”\n\nThe film was shot over a period of seven years. Lemelson used this longitudinal approach to gain the trust of his subjects, saying, “We returned over and over so that people could see we weren’t just there to get data and never return.”\n\nThe film is presented in thematic chapters, with each new section introduced by a traditional Wayang Kulit shadow-puppet performance about the issues surrounding polygamous unions. The filmmakers commissioned this performance for use in the film. In earlier cuts of “Bitter Honey”, the film had focused on the husbands in these polygamous arrangements, but Lemelson quickly realized that the more compelling story arose from examining how these marriages are experienced by the co-wives.\n\nThe film follows the lives of three polygamous families living in Bali, Indonesia, where polygynous unions make up about 10% of households. The first is the family of Sadra, a fair trade craftsman with two wives and eight children living in separate compounds. Sadra’s main narrative thread concerns generational cycles of violence and his abusive relationship with his first wife and mother, and its effect on his children. At one point in the narrative, Sadra’s first wife requests the help of his boss and a local human rights lawyer to stage an intervention confronting Sadra about his abusive behavior. \nThe second family is that of local thug and cockfight organizer, Darma. His five wives each describe how they were “tricked or badgered” into accepting a polygamous marriage and their efforts to come to terms with it. Darma frequently seeks sexual relationships outside of his marital bonds, including with sex workers—putting himself and his wives at risk of STD infection. Consisting of ten wives, the third family profiled is that of Sang Putu Tuaji, a powerful elderly man who was the leader of a local anti-communist militia.\n\nThe film opened in limited theatrical release in the United States on October 3, 2014.\n\nCritical reception was mixed to positive, with reviewers praising the film for its objective illumination of cultural issues in relation to gender status in Indonesia. Many reviewers praised the film for its potential as an educational tool within Bali as well as in Western classrooms. Critics of the film believed it to be too narrow in its focus. Dennis Harvey of Variety wrote, “Intriguing enough in what it shows, \"Bitter Honey\" nonetheless frustrates for what it doesn’t.”\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an overall 67% positive approval rating based on 9 reviews, and a rating average of 5.8 out of 10. On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 62 out of 100, based on 6 reviews, indicating “generally favorable reviews.”\n\n"}

As of December 2013, CH2M had approximately 26,000 employees and 2013 revenues totaled $5.88 billion.\n\nThe firm was employee owned, with an internal stock market that operated buy/sell events quarterly. CH2M HILL announced a global rebrand on 13 April 2015, adopting the nickname CH2M while retaining CH2M HILL Companies Ltd. as the firm's legal name. \n\nIn December 2017, it was announced that CH2M had been acquired by Jacobs Engineering Group, a Dallas Engineering firm, reportedly for $3.3 Billion. \n\nCH2M was founded in 1946 in Corvallis, Oregon, by Oregon State University civil engineering professor Fred Merryfield and three of his students: Holly Cornell, James Howland and Thomas Burke Hayes (the firm was named after the founders, with Howland and Hayes making up the H2 portion). Cornell, Howland, and Hayes were all graduates of Oregon State University.\n\nThe company became CH2M Hill, after a merger in 1971 with Clair A. Hill and Associates of Redding, California. The firm remained headquartered in Oregon until 1980, when a decision was made to relocate to Colorado, a more central location in the United States.\n\nOn August 2, 2017, CH2M agreed to be purchased by Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. in a US$2.85 billion cash and stock deal. Shareholders approved the deal in December 2017, and the completion of the acquisition was announced on 18 December.\n\nThe company operates in multiple business units, among the operating divisions, Water, Energy & Facilities; Government, Environment & Infrastructure; and International. Business groups served include: Water; Transportation; Operations and Maintenance; Government Facilities and Infrastructure; Nuclear; Environmental; Energy and Chemicals; Power; and Industrial and Advanced Technology.\n\nThe company developed, maintains and publishes its own method for managing projects for clients, called the CH2M Hill Project Delivery System, which may be found at popular internet book retailers. As a firm specializing in project management, CH2M Hill has been associated in several large, complex projects around the world. In 2005, a CH2M Hill joint venture known as Kaiser Hill decommissioned and closed a former nuclear weapons facility at the Rocky Flats site in Colorado (former Rocky Flats Plant).\n\nIn Singapore, the company was part of a joint venture to replace the country's sanitary services infrastructure. The new Singapore Deep Tunnel System was designed to improve reliability, ease, and economy of operation, and to help handle Singapore's increasing waterfront utilization. CH2M Hill assisted in reconstruction efforts along the US Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nIts main assignments included providing temporary housing, debris removal, and other services. Other large projects include a $660 million gas fired power plant in Australia, in conjunction with General Electric, and an $11.7 billion project to relocate American military bases in Korea.\n\nIn August 2007, the Panama Canal Authority selected CH2M Hill to manage the $5.25 billion Panama Canal expansion project, which will add new locks to the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the canal and allow Post Panamax ships passage through the canal for the first time. In 2009, a CH2M Hill consortium was named program partner to oversee construction of the Crossrail project to expand London's transit system.\n\nOn August 30, 2006, as part of joint venture CLM, CH2M Hill was a supplier for the London 2012 Olympics. The other two members of the venture are project management service provider Mace Group and Laing O'Rourke, the largest privately owned construction firm in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe company manages projects for the clients, taking into account the environmental footprint, aiming to use sustainable technology. The firm reduced its own internal environmental footprint in 2011.\n\nIn 2008, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) contracted a CH2M Hill company, CH2M Hill Plateau Remediation Company, LLC (CHPRC), to manage deconstruction and remediation of the Central Plateau on the Hanford Nuclear Site in eastern Washington, one of the world's largest environmental cleanup projects. The project focused on shrinking the environmental footprint of the Hanford Site from a area (large enough to fit the city of Los Angeles) to or less.\n\nMore importantly, the project will reduce legacy infrastructure costs on site by more than $25 million per year starting in 2015. Using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding, CHPRC sped up cleanup of the site over two years, reducing the site footprint 25 percent, employing an additional 1,350 people in the process.\n\nWhen ARRA funded work concludes in September 2012, the site footprint was targeted to shrink to a total of , roughly half its previous size. Without ARRA funding, however, the scope of DOE contracted work at Hanford will be reduced. The company also announced that its workforce would reduce by up to 1,350 workers later that year through a combination of voluntary and involuntary separations.\n\nIn February 2012, the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee appointed the company to manage the delivery of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.\n\nCH2M HILL are the developers of Flood Modeller Pro, an industry leading flood risk modelling and real time flood forecasting suite of software.\n\nKey acquisitions include Black, Crow & Eidsness (a southeast engineering firm in the United States) in 1977, Gore & Storrie (a Canadian water and wastewater engineering firm) in 1995, Gee & Jensen (a Ports and Harbor firm based in Florida) in August 2002, DeMil International (a weapons destruction firm based in the United States) in 2002, EHS Consultants Ltd (a consulting firm based in Hong Kong), Lockwood Greene, the oldest continuously operating professional services firm in the United States in December 2003, and BBS Corporation (an environmental engineering firm based in Ohio) in October 2005.\n\nOn September 7, 2007, CH2M HILL finalized the purchase of most of the components of VECO, an Alaska based firm specialising in services to the oil, gas, and energy sector that had become embroiled in the Alaska political corruption probe. In December 2007, CH2M Hill acquired Trigon EPC. In March 2008, CH2M Hill acquired Texas based Goldston Engineering, a company specialising in marine and coastal transportation engineering services.\n\nIn July 2011, CH2M Hill finalised the acquisition of Booz Allen Hamilton's State & Local Government Transportation Consulting (S&L Transportation) business. In September 2011, CH2M Hill announced that it intended to acquire the share capital of Halcrow Group Limited, a engineering consultancy based in the United Kingdom that operates worldwide. The acquisition for £124m was completed on November 10, 2011. In 2014, CH2M Hill acquired TERA Environmental Consultants of Calgary, Alberta.\n\nIn December 2017, Jacobs Engineering announced that it had acquired CH2M. The acquisition was supported by 96% of CH2M employee shareholders. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "5365334", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5365334", "title": "Catastrophe (drama)", "text": "Catastrophe (drama)\n\nIn drama, particularly the tragedies of classical antiquity, the catastrophe is the final resolution in a poem or narrative plot, which unravels the intrigue and brings the piece to a close. In comedies, this may be a marriage between main characters; in tragedies, it may be the death of one or more main characters. It is the final part of a play, following the protasis, epitasis, and catastasis.\n\nThe catastrophe is either simple or complex, for which also the fable and action are denominated. In a simple catastrophe, there is no change in the state of the main characters, nor any discovery or unravelling; the plot being only a mere passage out of agitation, to quiet and repose. This catastrophe is rather accommodated to the nature of the epic poem, than of the tragedy. \n\nIn a complex catastrophe, the main character undergoes a change of fortune, sometimes by means of a discovery, and sometimes without. The qualifications of this change are that it be probable and necessary: in order to be probable, it must be the natural result or effect of the foregoing actions, \"i.e.\" it must spring from the subject itself, or take its rise from the incidents, and not be introduced merely to serve a turn.\n\nThe \"discovery\" in a complex catastrophe must have the same qualifications as the catastrophe itself, of which it is a principal part: it must be both probable and necessary. To be probable, it must spring out of the subject itself; not affected by means of marks or tokens, rings, bracelets, or by a mere recollection, as is frequently done both in ancient and modern times. To be necessary, it must never leave the characters it concerns in the same sentiments they had before, but still produce either love or hatred, etc. Sometimes, the change consists in the discovery, sometimes it follows at a distance, and sometimes results immediately from it; the last was used, for example, in \"Oedipus Rex\".\n\nAmong critics, it has long been debated whether the catastrophe should always end happily, and favorably on the side of virtue, or not; \"i.e.\" whether virtue is always to be rewarded, and vice punished, in the catastrophe. Aristotle, for example, preferred a shocking catastrophe, rather than a happy one; in that regard, the moving of terror and pity, which is the aim of tragedy, is better effected by the former than the latter.\n\nRené Le Bossu, a 17th-century French critic, divides the catastrophe, at least with regards to epics, into the unravelling, or \"denouement\", and the finishing, or \"achievement\"; the latter of which he makes the result of the former, and to consist in the hero's passage out of a state of trouble and agitation, to rest and quiet. This period is but a point, without extent or duration; in which it differs from the former, which comprehends everything after the plot is laid. He adds, that there are several unravellings in a piece, each interconnected. The \"finishing\" is the end of the last unravelling.\n\nIn the twentieth century, J.R.R. Tolkien distinguished between what he called the \"catastrophe\" and the \"eucatastrophe\". The eucatastrophe is a classical catastrophe with an unexpected positive outcome for the protagonist. This term was coined to distance itself from the vernacular use of the word 'catastrophe' to signify disaster (which gave the term negative connotations in everyday usage).\n\n"}

Peignot et Fils) was a French typographic foundry, established in 1898 and closed down between 1919 and 1923 after a merger to become Deberny & Peignot foundry. Led by Georges Peignot (1872–1915), G. Peignot & Fils was a prestigious French typographic foundry, an \"elite house\", according to Louis Barthou, former French Prime Minister.\n\nG. Peignot et Fils is founded in 1898 in Paris, after absorption of the Veuve Routier et Peignot foundry (established in 1867), itself heir of the foundry \"Veuve Routier\" (established in 1865) and foundry of Pierre Leclerc (established in 1842).\n\nIn 1842, Pierre Leclerc, a craftsman, creates a fixed spaces foundry (hand-set metal type to achieve letter-spacing) in Paris. \"He can be considered as the genuine creator of the fixed spaces industry\", says the magazine \"La fonderie typographique\" in 1899. These fixed spaces between words and lines, margins, etc., require great precision. He invents a new process, instead of cutting fixed spaces, pouring them into molds, which increases accuracy. In 1856, after his death, the company management is entrusted to a friend of his widow, Clémentine Dupont de Vieux Pont (wife Peignot, 1815-1897). She then settles beside her his son, Gustave Peignot (1839-1899), engineer of Arts et Métiers school.\n\nIn 1865, the foundry of Pierre Leclerc is sold by auction to Peignot. The new company is called \"Veuve Routier\" (\"Widow Routier\"), which is the name of the lessor having made possible the purchase by Gustave Peignot. In 1867, Gustave Peignot and the lessor merge in a company which takes the name of \"Veuve Routier et Peignot.\"\n\nIn 1869 the company moved to Boulevard de Montrouge (now boulevard Edgar-Quinet), at no. 66-68, where a building is constructed (upstairs for the family, ground for the plant). In 1875, the debt to the Veuve Routier is cleared, and Gustave Peignot becomes sole owner of the company and the building.\nFrom 1875 to 1898, Gustave Peignot continues to make great profits with fixed spaces production, not amputated this time by refunds to the Veuve Routier. \"In this lead will Thou find gold\", used to say his mother. At this time, Gustave Peignot becomes first President of the Chambre syndicale des maîtres fondeurs typographes (trade association of type foundry masters). He marries Marie Laporte, and is a father of 8 children.\n\nIn 1898, Gustave Peignot distributes to his children an equal parts of stocks and appoints Georges Peignot, his second son, as co-manager. The company's name changes for \"G. Peignot & Fils\" (\"G. Peignot & Sons\"). He dies in 1899.\n\nGeorges Peignot continues the production of fixed spaces, causing significant growth in sales, and launches studies for new typefaces. The quality of fonts puts foundry G. Peignot et Fils at the forefront. In 12 years, Georges Peignot creates many typefaces: Grasset, Auriol, Cochin, Garamond-Peignot, Bellery-Desfontaines, Naudin, Guy-Arnoux. He also publishes a \"Specimen\", great typefaces catalog (still highly sought, 600 pages, 2 volumes).\n\nIn 1904, to address growth of sales, G. Peignot et Fils built a new plant at the corner of Cabanis and Ferrus streets. In 1911-1912, Georges Peignot sends in South America his two young brothers, Lucien and Rémy, looking for distributors. The company is at its peak.\n\nBut war brakes out in 1914. Volunteer for the front, Adjudant Georges Peignot is killed by a bullet to the forehead at the head of his section, Sept. 28, 1915, near Givenchy. His four brothers also die.\n\nThe legacy of Georges Peignot is taken hostage by infighting: in 1919, his own mother, Marie Laporte-Peignot, requires its children or their widows the payment of a substantial sum (1 million of French francs, equivalent of USD [2015] 1,4 million) in the form of a capital increase to its competitor Deberny (founded by Balzac in 1826), owned by Charles Tuleu (heir of Alexandre de Berny and husband of Jane Peignot-Tuleu). In 1923, G. Peignot et Fils foundry disappears, victim of the merger between Deberny foundry (2.6 million, including the 1 million Peignot subsidy) and G. Peignot & Fils foundry (4.1 million). The new company's name relegates Peignot's name in background: the new entity is indeed called \"Deberny et Peignot\" and commonly called \"Deberny\". Against all logic (the manager is usually chosen by the majority shareholder), the manager of the small Deberny foundry, Robert Girard, under whom the old foundry Deberny had collapsed, takes the reins of the new entity.\n\nIn 1922, the Commission de l’enseignement et des beaux-arts (governmental \"Commission for education and fine arts\") suggests honoring the story of Peignot: it transports the awls of the foundry in the building of the Imprimerie nationale (Government printing office), near Gutenberg street in Paris. And it proposes that the continuation of this street would be baptized \"rue des Quatre-Frères-Peignot\" (\"Four-brothers-Peignot street\") in memory of Georges, André, Lucien and Rémy who died between September, 1914 and June, 1916, snatched by the World War I.\n\nG.

The film concentrated on Ellsworth \"Bumpy\" Johnson (Laurence Fishburne), Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth), and Lucky Luciano (Andy García).\n\nAfter being paroled from Sing Sing, Bumpy Johnson (Laurence Fishburne) returns to Harlem to resume his old life. He is welcomed back by his cousin, Illinois Gordon (Chi McBride) as well as Stephanie \"Madame Queen\" St. Clair (Cicely Tyson), the monarch reigning over the numbers racket in Harlem. The psychopathic Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth), a Mafia associate who reports to mob boss Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano (Andy Garcia) runs the numbers rackets in downtown New York. His gang has been crowding into Harlem, terrorizing residents to only play the numbers with his operation.\n\nWhile hanging on the stoop one afternoon with Illinois and his girlfriend Mary, Bumpy meets one of Mary's friends, Francine (Vanessa Williams). She and Illinois talk trash to each other, with her disapproving of the 'numbers' rackets Illinois is involved in and him defending it as the only way to make ends meet in the Depression. Bumpy introduces himself to her and is obviously interested. They meet again in a nightclub and dance together. Bumpy walks Francine home and they debate the effect of gambling in Harlem on its citizens. At her door, she says that he could do anything he wanted. He responds that he has written some poetry and then recites a poem to her, about her beautiful eyes.\n\nDutch Schultz asks to partner with the Queen, who declines the offer, as she disapproves of the violent tactics Schultz uses to terrorize her customers. Later a hit is ordered by Dutch on the Queen; however Whispers (Paul Benjamin) and Bumpy repel the attackers. Using his friendship with corrupt Captain Foley (Richard Bradford), of the New York City Police Department, Schultz arranges for the Queen to be arrested, and the Queen asks Johnson to take charge of the business during her incarceration. The Queen instructs Johnson to avoid bloodshed, but Schultz's men grow increasingly violent.\n\nBumpy and Dutch start a devastating war with each other. In one of Dutch's attempts on Bumpy's life, Dutch employs two big hit men. They break into Bumpy's home, killing two of his bodyguards and making their way up to the bedroom, where Bumpy and Francine are. They attack Bumpy and Francine in the bathroom. One of them is killed and the scene culminates in Francine having to shoot the other just as he is about to kill Bumpy. They hold each other on the floor of the bathroom, covered in blood. More and more people are killed, including the sixteen-year-old Tyrone, who begged Bumpy to let him become a numbers runner for him.\n\nOne afternoon, Bumpy and Francine are having a banana split in his favorite ice cream parlor. Bumpy notices in the nick of time that the split has almonds on it, which he never orders. Francine is already to dig in when Bumpy stops her. Suddenly, the tension mounts, Bumpy's men rush all the regular citizens out of the parlor and pull down the shades. After questioning the terrified owner, Bumpy finds out that it was the new boy, Jimmie, who made the split, which has been poisoned. Bumpy invites him over to the table where he asks him to eat the split. The kid makes all kinds of excuses and is also terrified. After more threatening, he confesses it was one of Bumpy's closest men, Vallie, who set Bumpy up. Bumpy sends Francine out of the parlor and forces the kid to eat the poisoned ice cream. Bumpy, Illinois, Whispers and two other of his men take Vallie to a private pool hall and question Vallie about the set-up. Vallie weeps, confessing it was all for the money and begs for his life. Bumpy notices a nice ring on Vallie's finger and asks him if he bought it with the money, which Vallie vehemently denies. Eventually, everyone walks out except Whispers, who cuts Vallie's throat with a straight razor.\n\nBumpy and his gang show up at the Cotton Club in downtown New York. This is in Dutch's territory and does not allow black people in except as entertainers. Dutch is holding court. The place goes silent as Bumpy tells Dutch that he knows all about his operation and if Dutch doesn't shut it down, Bumpy will do it for him. Dutch mentions Vallie and Bumpy replies that Vallie won't be able to comment anymore but left a souvenir for Dutch. He puts a handkerchief on the table that contains a bloody finger, with a fancy ring on it. It nearly comes to a shoot-out, with cooler heads holding Dutch. Bumpy and his gang leave. When Dutch continues terrorizing uptown Harlem, Bumpy engages an explosives expert to rig a bomb. He and Illinois manage to infiltrate one of Dutch's liquor warehouses as delivery boys and just manage to get away before the whole building explodes.\n\nIn the meantime, Dutch and his men have broken into Mary's house (Illinois' girlfriend). Dutch hits and threatens her, asking her where Illinois is. One of his right hand men, Bub (Clarence Williams III) says she doesn't know anything and he doesn't have to do this. Dutch tells him to toughen up. After blowing up the warehouse, Illinois makes his way back to Mary's to find her dead.\n\nBumpy arrives home where Francine tells him that she is leaving him. He is enraged and starts throwing the fancy dresses and jewels that he bought at her. She yells that she didn't want any of them and that she doesn't know him anymore, that he is no longer the good man with whom she had fallen in love.\n\nDevastated by Mary's death, Illinois gets drunk and tells Bumpy that he's changed, that he is as bad as Dutch now. They have it out; Illinois says he's finished with Bumpy and staggers out. As he's walking down the street, Captain Foley and Bub Hewlett (Clarence Williams III) see him, kidnap him and chain him up in a machinery room. Foley beats him and wants to torture him for information. Hewlett says Illinois isn't going to talk and wants him let go. He leaves but Foley kills him using a corkscrew. Eager to end the war between each faction, Luciano decides to try and make the Schultz and Johnson come to an agreement, although neither wants to compromise.\n\nLater that evening, word comes to the Johnson house that Illinois has been found murdered. Johnson and his gang go to the warehouse where Illinois was killed and find him hanging by a chain on the outside wall, one of the 'numbers' tickets in his mouth and a suitcase with \"No More Secrets\" written across it attached to him. A local witness tells them that he saw a man with Captain's bars with Illinois shortly before his murder. Bumpy immediately knows who it is and gets his revenge on Foley by cutting his throat after finding him in a room with a prostitute. As Bumpy is leaving, he sees Bub Hewlett and asks if he had a hand in Illinois's murder. He denies any involvement so Bumpy spares him and tells him that he now owes him.\nBumpy has a meeting with Bub and tells him that it's not in his best interest to continue working for Dutch. Bumpy later contacts Luciano and tells him that he wants to compromise. Luciano agrees to the terms and they devise a plan to kill Dutch. Cecil, Luciano's driver, appears to betray Luciano and Bumpy by telling Dutch what they are planning. Cecil, however, is being paid by Bumpy to do so. Believing he now has the upper hand, Dutch plans the murder of Luciano and Bumpy but fails to do so. Luciano and Bumpy's plan is revealed when Lulu (Ed O'Ross) (Dutch's right-hand man) follows Dutch into the restroom and shoots him three times. Dutch walks out of the restroom and down the stairs, sits down at a table and drops dead. Lulu walks outside, gets in Luciano's car and asks to be paid but instead, an associate of Luciano's shoots him dead and dumps his body on the sidewalk.\nThe last scene shows Bumpy asking Bub if those involved have been paid, with Bub saying yes. With the Queen back in business, Johnson tells Bub that he has some unfinished business and Bub says he's going to go get some sleep. The two shake hands and part company. Bumpy then walks across the street and enters the church to briefly pay his final respects to Illinois. The gospel choir sings \"Amazing Grace\" while he walks down the aisle, exchanging looks with Francine and Madame Queen. When he arrives at the coffin, he goes down on his knees with tears in his eyes, then turns and walks out. He takes off his hat and turns his face up to the pouring rain, letting it run down his face.\n\n\nA soundtrack containing hip hop and R&B music was released on August 12, 1997 by Interscope Records. It peaked at #94 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and #23 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 45% based on 20 reviews.\n\nCritic Roger Ebert noted that \"the film is being marketed as a violent action picture, and in a sense, it is\" and that director Bill Duke having made \"a historical drama as much as a thriller, and his characters reflect a time when Harlem seemed poised on the brink of better things, and the despair of the postwar years was not easily seen on its prosperous streets.\"\n\n\n"}

It came into force in 1993. The Act provides exclusive rights for the creator of the integrated circuit topography and remedies to deter infringement. The exclusive right is transferable. To receive the exclusive right to an integrated circuit topography the topography must be registered at the Canadian Intellectual Property Office. Between 1993 and 1999 there were about 38 registrations under the Act.\n\nIntegrated Circuit Topographies (ICT) are electronic integrated circuits or IC products that are configured and interconnected.

Because products containing these circuits are often exported outside Canada, Canada has reciprocal agreements with other countries that also protect the design for ten years.\n\nSources:\nEntrepreneurship: Creating a Venture \nBy: Lori Cranson and Madeline Dennis\n\n"}
{"id": "344423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=344423", "title": "Jewish symbolism", "text": "Jewish symbolism\n\nThe Hebrew word for symbol is \"ot\", which, in early Judaism, denoted not only a sign, but also a visible religious token of the relation between God and man.\n\nThe Shabbat, according to Ezekiel 20:12 is God's sign (\"ot\") between Him and His people. It states, \"Moreover also I gave them my shabbats, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them.\" The Shabbat was instituted on the seventh day of creation for all mankind, and God did three things as our example in Genesis 2:1-3... 1) He rested from all work, 2) He blessed the Shabbat, and 3) God sanctified the seventh day, which means He set it apart for only Holy use. The ten commandments in Exodus 20:8-12 explain further that, \"six days shall you labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Shabbat of the Lord your God, in that day you shall do no work\".\n\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, while the Israelites were living in the Sinai for forty years, they built a Tabernacle ( translit: \"mishkan\", \"Place of [Divine] dwelling\"); this was viewed as the abode of the Shekhinah (the presence of YHWH) on Earth, and the place where the priests could minister to God on behalf of the nation of Israel.\n\nThe Hebrew for priest is \"Kohen\"; the \"Kohanim\" (plural) mediated between God and man by offering sacrifices, and by other services in the Temple. The leader of them the \"Kohen Gadol\", the high priest.\n\nThe vestments of the high priest were interpreted in three ways. The explanation of Philo is as follows (\"Vita Mosis,\" iii. 209): His upper garment was the symbol of the ether, while the blossoms represented the earth, the pomegranates typified running water, and the bells denoted the music of the water. The ephod corresponded to heaven, and the stones on both shoulders to the two hemispheres, one above and the other below the earth. The six names on each of the stones were the six signs of the zodiac, which were denoted also by the twelve names on the breastplate. The miter was the sign of the crown, which exalted the high priest above all earthly kings.\n\nJosephus' explanation is this: The coat was the symbol of the earth, the upper garment emblemized heaven, while the bells and pomegranates represented thunder and lightning. The ephod typified the four elements, and the interwoven gold denoted the glory of God. The breastplate was in the center of the ephod, as the earth formed the center of the universe; the girdle symbolized the ocean, the stones on the shoulders the sun and moon, and the jewels in the breastplate the twelve signs of the zodiac, while the miter was a token of heaven.\n\nThe Jerusalem Talmud and Midrash \"Leviticus Rabbah\" (x.) give the following interpretation: The coat symbolized atonement for murder or for the sin of wearing mixed garments, and the undergarment typified atonement for unchastity. The miter denoted atonement for pride, and the belt for theft or trickery. The breastplate represented atonement for any perversion of the Law, the ephod for idolatry, and the robe for slander.\n\nThe number three was the symbol of holiness and love. The Holy of Holies occupied one-third, and the Holy Place two-thirds, of the entire Temple. The tapestries were ten times three ells in length, and there were three vessels each for the altar of burnt offering, the altar of incense, and the Ark. The candlestick had twice three arms (besides the shaft, which also held a lamp), and each arm had three knobs. The blessing of the priest consisted of three sections, and in the invocation of God the word \"holy\" was repeated thrice.\n\nThe symbolism of the number four was based on the contemplation of the quaternity as found in the universe, which included both heaven and earth The number four connoted heaven as the throne of God.\n\nThe Holy of Holies was in the form of a cube, and the Holy Place was a double cube in length. All the vessels of the Temple in Jerusalem (except the candlestick) were rectangular. According to Ezekiel i. 26-28, the number four symbolized the divine revelation, while in the view of Philo it was the number of complete harmony.\n\nThe number five typified semicompletion. The dimensions of the curtain of the Holy of Holies were four ells by five; the altar in the court covered a surface of five square ells; and there were five pillars at the entrance to the Tabernacle.\n\nThe number six symbolizes imperfection.\n\nThe number seven was the general symbol for all association with God, and was the favorite religious number of Judaism, typifying the covenant of holiness and sanctification, and also all that was holy and sanctifying in purpose. The candlestick had seven lamps, and the acts of atonement and purification were accompanied by a sevenfold sprinkling. The establishment of the Sabbath, the Sabbatical year, and the year of jubilee was based on the number seven, as were the periods of purification and of mourning.\nThe number 7 is the Divine number of completion.\n\nThe number eight symbolizes new beginnings. According to Kaballah in the Zohar the number eight signifies this because the eighth day was the first day after creation when God returned to work; the week began again.\n\nThe number ten symbolized absolute completeness. The court to the Tabernacle was ten times ten ells long, and five times ten ells wide, and in the Holy of Holies the Ten Commandments were preserved.\n\nThe number twelve, being the product of three and four, typified the union of the people with God. On the table were twelve loaves of show-bread, and the breastplate of the priest contained twelve precious stones as emblems of the twelve tribes of Israel, which camped round about the Sanctuary.\n\nThe number thirteen symbolizes the principles of faith and God's mercy.\n\nThe number eighteen is considered significant because the Hebrew word for \"life\" is חי (\"chai\"), which has a numerical value of 18.\n\nThe number twenty six symbolizes God's name.\n\nGold was the symbol of the divine or celestial light, the glory of God. Silver was the emblem of moral innocence and of holiness. Brass symbolized hardness, strength, and firmness. Brass was a substitute for gold, and iron for silver.\n\nSalt was declared to be necessary in every meal-offering, in which it takes the place of the blood in the animal sacrifices. In the Talmud salt symbolizes the Torah, for as the world cannot exist without salt, so it can not endure without the Torah.\n\nThe Israelites used an indigo-colored dye called \"tekhelet\"; this dye was likely made from snail \"murex trunculus\". This dye was very important in both Jewish and non-Jewish cultures of this time, and was used by royalty and the upper-class in dyeing their clothing, sheets, curtains, etc. This dye is known as Tyrian purple.\n\nIn the Torah the Israelites are commanded to dye one of the threads of their tallit (prayer shawl) with tekhelet; when they look at this dye they will think of the blue sky, and of the God above them in Heaven. Tekhelet corresponds to the color of the divine revelation (Midrash Numbers Rabbah xv.) Blue in Judaism has thus had an important significance throughout the history of Jewish culture up to the present. Blue was also associated with the ten commandments. When Moses and the elders went up the mount Sinai, they saw God standing on a Sapphire pavement (Blue) and the tables of the law were made of THE stone (i.e. Sapphire) and thus the blue on their garments was to be a permanent reminder of the law of God.\n\n\"Argaman\" was the symbol of power, and of glory, so that Alexander Balas robed Jonathan in purple, which was especially used to designate royal dignity.\n\n\"Tola'at\" and \"shani\" (\"scarlet,\" \"crimson\") symbolized blood, and thus frequently typified life, although this color often designated sin, as well as joy and happiness.\n\nPurification from sin was also symbolized by purple.\n\n\"Shesh\" (white) was the symbol of physical and intellectual purity, being the true color of light, without any modification. White also symbolizes death. In some cases, it can also symbolize life.\n\nYellow has an association with an anti-Semitic forced identification mark (see Yellow badge).\n\nThe Torah delineates three pilgrimage festivals, Passover, Shavuot (The Feasts of Weeks) and Sukkot (Tabernacles). Each of these was tied to the agricultural cycle of the Israelites, and was also given a theological symbolism.\n\nPassover celebrated the rebirth of nature, and symbolized the origin of the Jewish people.\n\nThe eating of bitter herbs symbolized the miseries of the Egyptian bondage. In the evenings four cups of wine were drunk, to symbolize the four world-kingdoms. People eating during the Passover meal reclined, in the style of free rich aristocrats, to represent their liberation from slavery.\n\nA discussion of the meaning of Shavuot (the Feast of Weeks) and of Sukkot, the Feast of Tabernacles, is found in the entries on those subjects.\n\nA discussion of symbolism inherent in Rosh Hashanah (The New Year) and Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement) is found in the entries on those subjects. The Day of Atonement was considered the most holy day of the entire year, and was regarded as the symbol of the complete atonement of the people and of their absolution from their sins committed against God.\n\nJeremiah beheld an almond-tree as a token of the speedy fulfillment of the word of God.\n\nAmos saw a basket of summer fruit as a symbol of the approaching end of Israel.\n\nAhijah the Shilonite tore Jeroboam's mantle into twelve pieces, to typify the division of the kingdom of Israel, and Zedekiah made horns of iron to encourage Ahab to engage in war with Ramoth-gilead. King Joash, at the command of the prophet Elisha, shot arrows from the open window into the air, to symbolize the destruction of his enemies.\n\nIsaiah walked naked and barefoot to show how the Egyptians and Ethiopians would be treated when taken captive by the Assyrians, while Jeremiah wore a yoke upon his neck to induce the nations to submit to the King of Assyria.\n\nEzekiel was commanded to inscribe the names of certain tribes upon separate pieces of wood, to show that God would reunite those tribes.\n\nSome common themes appear on many Jewish tombstones. Two hands with outspread fingers indicated that the dead man was descended from priestly stock (\"Kohanim\") who blessed the people in this fashion, and a jug was carved on the tombstones of the Levites as an emblem of those who washed the priest's hands before he pronounced the blessing.\n\nSome gravestones show a tree with branches either outspread or broken off, symbolizing the death of a young man or an old man respectively; or they have a cluster of grapes as an emblem of Israel.\n\nThe Star of David (\"Magen David\") occurs frequently.\n\nSometimes figures symbolized the name of the deceased, as the figure of a lion for Loeb, a wolf for Benjamin, and a rose for the name Bluma/Blume.\n\nThe influence of Judaism upon Christian symbolism as early as the 2nd and 3rd centuries A.D., is apparent both in painting and in sculpture, the most frequent motives being those that occur in the Mishnah as formulas for prayer on fast-days. The prayer beginning with the words \"Mi she-'anah,\" which was included in the selihah at an early date, was adopted in the Christian ritual as the litany \"Libera domine.\" This litany was figuratively used in a certain sequence as a symbol, for the sacrifice of Isaac was regarded as a symbol of the crucifixion of Jesus, since the early religions, and the act of sacrifice emblemized the death on the cross.\n\nAbraham was represented as the symbol of the power of faith and Isaac as the sacrificed redeemer. The ascension of Elijah was believed to typify the ascension of Jesus Christ, who was regarded by Christian symbolism as an analogue to Elijah, although this ascension was also taken as a type of the general resurrection from the dead. Job sitting among the ashes was the symbol of patience and of the power of resistance of the flesh; and Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah in the fiery furnace typified steadfastness in persecution and faith in the aid of God. Christian sarcophagi contained artistic representations of the fall of man, Noah and the ark, scenes from the life of Moses in three variations, Joshua, David, and Daniel.\n\nZion is a Biblical term that refers to Jerusalem, and is the source for the modern term Zionism.\n\n\n"}

At the beginning of 1985, to avoid conscription, he enrolled at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg for a Fine Arts degree. \nIn 1988, Kendell Geers was one of 143 young men who publicly refused to serve in the South African Defence Force and faced either a life in exile or six years' imprisonment in a civilian jail. In 1989 he left South Africa and lived for a brief period in exile in the United Kingdom and New York where he worked as an assistant to artist Richard Prince. \n\nIt was only after Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners' release from prison, that Geers could return from exile to Johannesburg without fear of being imprisoned. In 1990, he returned to Johannesburg where he worked as an artist, and art critic, curator and performance artist. The first work of art he created back on South African soil was \"Bloody Hell\", a ritual washing of his white Afrikaaner Boer body with his own fresh blood. \n\nRejecting everything his family and his community stood for, in 1993 he changed his name to Kendell Geers and his date of birth to May 1968 as a political act, reclaiming his identity.\n\nHe moved to Brussels in 2003.\n\nSometimes described as a political artist, Kendell Geers is known best for using a variety of colors and materials that signal danger such as sirens, broken glass, and barbed wire in an attempt to examine power structures, social injustices, and establishment values. Geers has worked with different media ranging from objects to large scale installation, neon works, performances and video.\nGeers also uses words as a means to explore the coding and reinterpretation of language and its meaning and to communicate with his audience.\n\nHis work had heavily political elements from 1988 to 2000, during which time Geers, explored the moral and ethical contradictions of the apartheid system through his practice. He developed a visual vocabulary characterized by provocation as well as humor by using found objects such as barbed wire or glass shards. By appropriating historical events and ideas, he focused on questions of relationship between individual and society. It was in this context that Geers changed his date of birth to May 1968, the start of the student and civil revolution, and joined every political party in the period before South Africa’s first democratic elections, from the extreme right-wing to the Communist party. In this way, he expressed his doubts about the fetishization of party politics.\n\nHe participated in the Venice Biennale in 1993, the first time since the anti-Apartheid boycotts that South African artists had been invited.\n\nFrom 1999 until 2004, Geers worked as the curator and art consult for Gencor which was later bought out by BHP Billiton. The collection focused on artists and works of art that were central to the Anti-Apartheid Movement spirit. In 1997 Geers edited and published \"Contemporary South African Art,\" with essays by Okwui Enwezor, Olu Oguibe, and others.\n\nInitiated by his move to Brussels in 2000, his later European period is characterized by a more poetic aesthetic. Here, Geers transferred his incendiary practice into a post-colonial and increasingly global context, suggesting more universal themes like terrorism, spirituality, and mortality. As such, the artist’s life and work can be said to constitute a living archive composed of political events, photographs, letters, and literary texts that serve as a source of inspiration and represent a continuation of his oeuvre.\n\nIn January 2013 a Geers retrospective called \"1988-2012\" opened at the Haus der Kunst in Munich. \nThe exhibition divided his life and work into two decade-long periods, the first political phase until 2000, and the later more poetic phase.\n\nIn 2011 Geers wrote a Manifesto in which through a series of statements, he explores the link between political and natural revolutions, mourns the loss of our talent for revolution and the underlying causes, and gives us clues on how to remember our inner selves to live a more true life.\n\nTogether with musician Patrick Codenys (Front 242) Kendell Geers formed the Belgium Audio-Visual group \"thefucKINGFUCKS\" in 2007. The project grew out of the now defunct \"Red Snyper\" collaboration between Geers and Codenys.\n\nHe has exhibited globally since 1993 and participated in numerous exhibitions including Documenta, the Carnegie International, Havana Biennial, Istanbul Biennial, Kwang Ju Biennial, Taipei Biennial, Gwangju Biennale, Lyon Biennial, Glasstress at the Venice Biennale, as well as presented solo exhibitions in the CCA Cincinnati, Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst Gent, Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art, Aspen Art Museum, MOCA in Rome, Migros Museum, Palais de Tokyo, the CAC in Lyon and Haus der Kunst in Munich.

Associated with the new generation of l'École de Rouen Pinchon executed this work in a Post-Impressionist style with a subdued Fauve or Neo-Impressionist palette of golden yellows and incandescent blues. The dynamic image of the train in Pinchon's painting is an homage to the emerging industrialized world.\n\nThe work was exhibited in April 1905 at the Galerie Legrip in Rouen (see photograph), and again at the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen; inauguration 13 November 1909. In the collection of at the time, \"Le Pont aux Anglais, soleil couchant\" was purchased by the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen in 1909 where it currently forms part of the permanent collection.\n\n\"Le Pont aux Anglais, soleil couchant\" is an oil painting on canvas in a horizontal format with dimensions 54 x 73 cm (21.25 by 28.75 in), signed \"R Pinchon\" lower left. The composition painted en plein air (sur le motif, in the open air), is dominated by the Pont aux Anglais, Rouen, with receding perspective tending towards the right side of the canvas. A locomotive and train cars pass over the bridge leaving a trail of steam in the direction of the receding perspective, carrying the eye towards the right, where below, a boat passes carrying two people a short distance from Le Pont aux Anglais. The rhythmic arches of the bridge and the speeding train create a sense of dynamism and modernity not often found in Post-Impressionist works. The colors Pinchon has chosen to depict this late afternoon scene are both warm and cool. The golden yellow highlights generated by the setting sun, off the canvas to the left, are juxtaposed against the grays, blues, violets and greens of the background hillside, the bridge and its massive base pillars, the poplar trees and the River Seine in the foreground.\n\nThe first railway station of Rouen was built on the left bank in 1843. The government authorized the continuation of the line to Le Havre and Dieppe the same year. It was therefore decided to build a bridge to the end of the Brouilly island (now connected to the Lacroix island), leading to the tunnel under the Côte Sainte-Catherine. The bridge, located in the Rouen metropolitan area, linking Paris and Le Havre, was named the \"English Bridge\" because many workers who built it were of English nationality. It is also called the Viaduc d'Eauplet, after the neighborhood where it is located.\n\nThe bridge originally consisted of wooden arches resting on piles of masonry. It was located a little further downstream than the existing bridge. It was inaugurated in 1847. A few months after its inauguration, in 1848, two arches on the side of the left bank were set on fire during a riot. It was then rebuilt. In 1856 the wooden arches were replaced by cast iron. This is the bridge that Pinchon painted. These arches proved fragile and it was decided to build a new bridge in 1912. Despite its destruction during the Second World War, the bridge completed and operational in 1914 is still used today.\n\nRobert Antoine Pinchon's first solo exhibition in Paris took place on 15–25 March 1909 at the Galerie des Artistes Modernes run by Chaine and Simonson, with thirty works listed in the catalogue. The show resulted in both sales and press coverage. This was followed by another show at the Galerie Legrip in Rouen on 30 June. A few months later, on 13 November, the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen, opened a show with fifty-two paintings: three by Claude Monet, nine by Alfred Sisley, three by Armand Guillaumin, one by Auguste Renoir, thirteen by Albert Lebourg, five by Joseph Delattre, two by Charles Frechon and four by Robert Antoine Pinchon (now almost twenty-three years old); \"Péniches dans la brume, Vue pris du Mont-Garan, Effet de neige\", and \"Le Pont aux Anglais, soleil couchant\".\n\nIn 1909 Pinchon, Pierre Dumont, Pierre Hodé and Eugène Tirvert founded the Société Normande de Peinture Moderne, attracting the participation of Georges Braque, Henri Matisse, Raoul Dufy, Maurice de Vlaminck, André Derain, Albert Marquet, Othon Friesz, Francis Picabia and Roger de La Fresnaye. The same year, four paintings by Pinchon entered the collection of the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen.\n\n"}

The letters depicted spell out a phrase or a name, usually that of the patron who commissioned the work. The paintings were done with watercolor on Manila paper.

In 2006, Gene Luen Yang's graphic novel \"American Born Chinese\", originally published as a webcomic on Modern Tales, was the first graphic novel to be nominated for a National Book Award. Don Hertzfeldt's animated film based on his webcomics, \"Everything Will Be OK\", won the 2007 Sundance Film Festival Jury Award in Short Filmmaking, a prize rarely bestowed on an animated film.\n\nWebcomic artists have also won comic awards from organizations that generally honor print comics, such as the Ignatz Awards and Eisner Awards, and there are awards, such as the Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards, which are given only to webcomics. \n\nFrom 2001 until 2008, the Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards were given out, with voting rights granted only to online cartoonists. Because of the large number of categories, such as \"Best Art\", \"Best Writing\", \"Best Gag Comic\" and \"Best Newcomer\", only the winners of the main category \"Best Comic\" are listed here. The following articles provide complete listings of all nominees and winners in each year:\n\nIn 2009 and 2010, users of internet forum The Webcomic List held an amateur award ceremony, where winners of its various categories were selected through a panel of judges. The ceremony itself was presented in the form of a webcomic, allowing it to spoof televised award shows as well as exhibit sample portions of the awardees.\n\nThe Eagle Award is a series of awards for comic book titles and creators. They are awarded by UK fan voting for work produced during the previous year. The awards featured a \"favourite web-based comic\" category from 2001 until its discontinuation in 2012.\n\nThe Will Eisner Comic Industry Award, commonly shortened to the Eisner Award, is a prize given for creative achievement in American comic books. In 2003, Justine Shaw's \"Nowhere Girl\" received a nomination for an Eisner award in the \"best new series\" category, while Shaw was nominated for \"talent deserving of wider recognition\", making her the first webcomic artist to be nominated for an Eisner. \"Paste Magazine\" noted in 2016 that the Eisner's conflation of \"digital comic\" and \"webcomic\" may cause independent works to be overshadowed by online services such as Marvel Unlimited and DC Comics' \"Digital First\". In 2017, it was split into \"Best Digital Comic\" and \"Best Webcomic\".\n\nThe Harvey Awards, named for writer-artist Harvey Kurtzman (1924-1993) and coordinated by the publisher Fantagraphics, are given for achievement in comic books. The Harveys were created as part of a successor to the Kirby Awards which were discontinued after 1987.\n\nFollowing the revamp in 2018 after the awards moved to New York Comic Con, the \"Best Online Comics Work\" has been renamed \"Digital Book of the Year\".\n\nThe Ignatz Awards are intended to recognize outstanding achievements in comics and cartooning by small press creators or creator-owned projects published by larger publishers. They have been awarded each year since 1997, but skipped a year in 2001 due to the show's cancellation after the September 11, 2001 attacks.

The abbey played an important role in the religious, political and religious life of the Prince-Bishopric of Liège, especially around the year 1000. In addition to its founder St Landelin, 4 other saints are said \"of Lobbes\".\n\nThe early history of Lobbes Abbey is known in relative detail because fortunately, and unlike with most abbeys, the ancient annals survived. The monastery was founded by Saint Landelin around 650. Landelin was a young man from a well-to-do family in Bapaume, who lived a sinful life as the head of a band of brigands. After repenting, he founded a monastery at the place where he had committed his sins, at the shores of the river Sambre. The number of monks at the new monastery increased rapidly and the founder grew tired of his duties as an abbot, so in 680 he resigned from his post and dedicated the rest of his life to the worship of God.\n\nLandelin was succeeded by Ursmar (Saint Ursmarus) who devoted himself to preaching Christianity among the largely pagan Franks. The fame of Saint Ursmarus and his successors Ermin of Lobbes, Abel of Reims and Theodulph of Lobbes, made Lobbes the most important monastery in Belgium of the time. Under Anson, the 6th abbot (776-800), the abbey school rose to great fame. \n\nIn 864 Hucbert, brother-in-law of Lothair II of Lotharingia, became lay abbot. Through his decadent lifestyle he almost brought the monastery to destitution. His successor, Franco, was both abbot of Lobbes and bishop of Liège, a situation that continued until 960. The abbey basically became a fief of the Bishop of Liège, although ecclesiastically it was situated in the bishopric of Cambrai. \n\nIn 954 the abbey was raided and burned during the Hungarian invasions of Europe.\n\nUnder the abbots Folcuin (965-990), Heriger of Lobbes (990-1007) and Hugo (1033–1053), the abbey and the school once again attained a great reputation.\n\nAfter this period the fame of the abbey gradually declined, until the monastic revival originating from the Bursfelde Congregation brought fresh life in the 15th century. In 1569 Lobbes, St. Vaast's Abbey in Arras, and several other abbeys, were combined to form the \"Benedictine Congregation of Exempt Monasteries of Flanders\".\n\nIn 1794, the last abbot, Vulgise de Vignron, and 43 monks were expelled from the monastery by French revolutionary troops. Under the law of 2 September 1796 the abbey was dissolved. Most of the monastic buildings, including the abbey church of Saint Peter, were destroyed. The former burial church of Saint Ursmarus survived as a parish church. A few other minor buildings were later incorporated into a railway station.\n\nThe church of Saint Ursmarus is one of the oldest churches in Belgium. The oldest parts date from Carolingian or Ottonian times. The choir and crypt are Romanesque and stand out by their simplicity. The crypt contains the tombs of Saint Ursmarus and Saint Erminus, as well as tombstones from other abbots. The westwork tower is a typical example of Mosan architecture. The pointed spire was added in the 19th century.\n\nFrom 1865 until 1870 the church was restored by the architect Eugène Carpentier, who basically rebuilt large sections of the church and removed all traces of earlier situations.\n\nToday the Abbey library stored a copy of \"Lobbes Bible\" completed in 1084 AD and a digitized copy is available on line at IRHT (see Lobbes Bible).\n\n"}

This tradition flourished in Latin schools in continental Europe from the mid-17th century until the introduction of publishers bindings after about 1830. Books continued to be given as prizes at academic ceremonies, but the only distinguishing feature are typically special inscriptions and/or bookplates.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the tradition of special prize bindings persisted until the mid-20th century with the demise of traditional hand binding. Most titles consist of classical works in the humanities published in unbound print runs for this purpose. Schools would contract with a local bindery to prepare prize editions stamped or embossed with the logo of the school. The editions are often made to resemble the fine bindings of the 18th century and are prized by booksellers for their classical appearance. They are often mistaken as ex-school library books but can be distinguished by a prize inscription, lack of call number, and general higher quality of the binding.\n\n"}
{"id": "22417121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22417121", "title": "Rabelais and His World", "text": "Rabelais and His World\n\nRabelais and His World (Russian: Творчество Франсуа Рабле и народная культура средневековья и Ренессанса, \"Tvorčestvo Fransua Rable i narodnaja kul'tura srednevekov'ja i Renessansa\"; 1965) is a scholarly work which is considered one of Mikhail Bakhtin's most important texts and now a classic of Renaissance studies. In the work Bakhtin explores \"Gargantua and Pantagruel\" by the French Renaissance writer François Rabelais.\n\nBakhtin argues that for centuries Rabelais’s book has been misunderstood. Bakhtin attempts to redress this and clarify Rabelais's intentions through two methods: recovery of sections of \"Gargantua and Pantagruel\" that were previously either ignored or suppressed, and analysis of the Renaissance social system in order to discover the balance between language that was permitted and language that was not. Through this analysis, Bakhtin pinpoints two important subtexts: \"carnival\" (carnivalesque) which Bakhtin describes as a social institution, and \"grotesque realism,\" which is defined as a literary mode. \n\nThus, in \"Rabelais and His World\" Bakhtin studies the interaction between the social and the literary, as well as the meaning of the body. As written, \"Rabelais and His World\" not only examines the openness of \"Gargantua and Pantagruel\", it also serves as an example of such openness.\n\nBakhtin completed his book on Rabelais (titled \"Rabelais in the History of Realism\") in 1940. After several attempts to get the book published fell through, it was submitted as a dissertation for the Candidate of Sciences degree at the Gorky Institute of World Literature in Moscow. At the dissertation's defense in 1946, all three official opponents were in favor of awarding Bakhtin a higher doctoral degree: the Doctor of Sciences, and their motion was accepted with a narrow majority vote. However, following an assault on the institute published in the press at the time, and after six years of repeated revisions and deliberations, USSR's VAK decided Bakhtin would only receive the Candidate of Sciences degree (roughly equivalent to a research doctorate). The book was eventually published in Russian in 1965, under the title \"Rabelais and Folk Culture of the Middle Ages and Renaissance\". Its 1968 English translation by Hélène Iswolsky was given the title, \"Rabelais and His World\".\n\nFor Bakhtin, \"carnival\" is associated with the collectivity. Those attending a carnival do not merely constitute a crowd; rather the people are seen as a\nwhole, organized in a way that defies socioeconomic and political organization. According to Bakhtin, “[A]ll were considered equal during carnival. Here, in the town square, a special form of free and familiar contact reigned among people who were usually divided by the barriers of caste, property, profession, and age”. The carnival atmosphere holds the lower strata of life most important, as opposed to higher functions (thought, speech, soul) which were usually held dear in the signifying order. At carnival time, the unique sense of time and space causes individuals to feel they are a part of the collectivity, at which point they cease to be themselves. It is at this point that, through costume and mask, an individual exchanges bodies and is renewed. At the same time there arises a heightened awareness of one’s sensual, material, bodily unity and community.\n\nBakhtin’s notion of \"carnival\" is connected with that of the \"grotesque\". In the carnival, usual social hierarchies and proprieties are upended; emphasis is placed on the body in its open dimension, in its connection to the life of the community. This emphasis on the material dimension which links humans, rather than on the differences and separations between them, allows for the consciousness of the historical dimension of human life: for every death, there is a birth, a renewal of the human spirit. This process allows for progress.<br>\nIn the grotesque body, emphasis is placed on the open, the penetrative, and the \"lower stratum.\" The open (the mouth, the anus, the vagina, etc.) and the penetrative (the nose, the penis, etc.) allow exchange between the body and the world (mostly through sex, eating, and drinking), but also to produce degrading material (curses, urine, feces, etc.). The lower stratum (belly, womb, etc.) is the place where renewal happens, where new life is forged, thus connecting degradation to renewal. The grotesque body is one of excess, rebellious to authority and austerity. <br>\nDue to its inscription in time and its emphasis on bodily changes (through eating, evacuation, and sex), the \"grotesque\" has been interpreted by some critics as a dimension of the body that permits to perceive the historicity of man: it is in this reading used as a measuring device.\n\nBakhtin opens this work with a quotation from Alexander Herzen: \"It would be extremely interesting to write the history of laughter\".\n\nOne of the primary expressions of the ancient world's conceptions of laughter is the text that survives in the form of apocryphal letters of Hippocrates about Democritus (Hippocratic Corpus, \"Epistles\" 10–21). The laughter of Democritus had a philosophical character, being directed at the life of man and at all the vain fears and hopes related to the gods and to life after death. Democritus here made of his laughter a complete conception of the world, a certain spiritual premise of the man who has attained maturity and has awakened. Hippocrates finally perfectly agreed with him.\n\n"}

{"id": "44136736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44136736", "title": "Research-based design", "text": "Research-based design\n\nThe research-based design process is a research process proposed by Teemu Leinonen inspired by design theories. It is strongly oriented towards the building of prototypes and it emphasizes creative solutions, exploration of various ideas and design concepts, continuous testing and redesign of the design solutions. This method is also influenced by the Scandinavian participatory design approach. Therefore, most of the activities take place in a close dialogue with the community that is expected to use the tools designed.\n\nThe process can be divided into four major phases, although they all happen concurrently and side-by-side. At different times of the research, researchers are asked to put more effort into different phases. The continuous iteration, however, asks researchers to keep all the phases alive all the time: contextual inquiry, participatory design, product design, prototype as hypothesis.\n\nContextual inquiry refers to the exploration of the socio-cultural context of the design. The aim is to understand the environment, situation, and culture where the design takes place. The results of the contextual inquiry are better understanding of the context by recognizing in it possible challenges and design opportunities. In this phase, design researchers use rapid ethnographic methods, such as participatory observation, note-taking, sketching, informal conversations, and interviews. At the same time as the field work, the design researchers are doing a focused review of the literature, benchmarking existing solutions, and analyzing trends in the area in order to develop insights into the design challenges.\n\nThroughout the contextual inquiry design researchers start to develop some preliminary design ideas, which would be validated during the next stage—participatory design—in workshops with different stakeholders. The participatory design sessions tend to take place with small groups of 4 to 6 participants. A common practice is to present the results as scenarios made by the design researchers containing challenges and design opportunities. In the workshop, the participants are invited to come up with design solutions to the challenges and to bring to the discussion new challenges and solutions.\n\nSince one of the main features of the research-based design is its participatory nature, the user's involvement is an integral part of the process. In this regard, participatory design workshops are organized during the different stages in order to validate initial ideas and discuss the prototypes at different stage of development.\n\nThe results of the participatory design are analyzed in a design studio by the design researchers who use the feedback to redefine the design problems and redesign the prototypes. By keeping a distance from the stakeholders, in the product design phase the design researchers will get a chance to analyze the results of the participatory design, categorize them, use specific design language related to implementation of the prototypes, and finally make design decisions.\n\nUltimately, the prototypes are developed to be functional on a level that they can be tested with real people in their everyday situations. The prototypes are still considered to be a hypothesis, prototypes as hypothesis, because they are expected to be part of the solutions for the challenges defined and redefined during the research. It remains to the stakeholders to decide whether they support the assertions made by the design researchers.\n\nResearch-based design is not to be confused with design-based research. In research-based design, which builds on art and design tradition, the focus is on the artifacts, the end-results of the design. The way the artifacts are, the affordances and features they have or do not have, form an important part of the research argumentation. As such, research-based design as a methodological approach includes research, design, and design interventions that are all intertwined.\n"}

It made the Idea of Progress a central concern of Enlightenment thought. He argued that expanding knowledge in the natural and social sciences would lead to an ever more just world of individual freedom, material affluence, and moral compassion. He argued for three general propositions: that the past revealed an order that could be understood in terms of the progressive development of human capabilities, showing that humanity's \"present state, and those through which it has passed, are a necessary constitution of the moral composition of humankind\"; that the progress of the natural sciences must be followed by progress in the moral and political sciences \"no less certain, no less secure from political revolutions\"; that social evils are the result of ignorance and error rather than an inevitable consequence of human nature.\n\nCondorcet's writings were a key contribution to the French Enlightenment, particularly his work on the Idea of Progress. Condorcet believed that through the use of our senses and communication with others, knowledge could be compared and contrasted as a way of analyzing our systems of belief and understanding through 10 epochs (stages). None of Condorcet's writings refer to a belief in a religion or a god who intervenes in human affairs. Condorcet instead frequently had written of his faith in humanity itself and its ability to progress with the help of philosophers such as Aristotle. Through this accumulation and sharing of knowledge he believed it was possible for any man to comprehend all the known facts of the natural world. The enlightenment of the natural world spurred the desire for enlightenment of the social and political world. Condorcet believed that there was no definition of the perfect human existence and thus believed that the progression of the human race would inevitably continue throughout the course of our existence. He envisioned man as continually progressing toward a perfectly utopian society. However, he stressed that for this to be a possibility man must unify regardless of race, religion, culture or gender.\n\nHere is a quote from the 1795 English edition of his book: \n\n"}

It is a variant of the earlier \"slogorn\", which was an Anglicisation of the Scottish Gaelic \"sluagh-ghairm\" (\"sluagh\" \"army\", \"host\" + \"gairm\" \"cry\"). Slogans are used in heraldry, most notably in Scottish heraldry. In Scottish heraldry slogans are used as mottoes, or secondary mottoes. Slogans usually appear above the crest on a coat of arms, though sometimes they appear as a secondary motto beneath the shield. There may be several possible origins for mottoes used in heraldry, however slogans are considered to have originated from battle cries or war cries. There are several notable heraldic mottoes which are thought to originate from a war cries. For example, the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom contains the motto \"DIEU ET MON DROIT\" (\"God and my right\") which has been thought to originated as a war cry. As has the motto \"MONTJOYE SAINT-DENIS\" which appeared on the former French coat of arms (this motto is refers to the \"oriflamme\", the royal standard of the kings of France, which was kept in the Basilique Saint-Denis). Several mottoes found in Irish heraldry, which end in \"a boo\", are also thought to have originated as war cries. Examples of such Irish mottoes are \"CROM A BOO\" of the Fitzgerald earls of Leinster; and \"SHANET A BOO\" of the Fitzgerald earls of Desmond.\n\nNot all slogans are actually authentic war cries though. Many slogans pertaining to Scottish clan chiefs have been registered relatively recently at the Court of the Lord Lyon. Sometimes slogans are merely a name, such as \"A HOME A HOME A HOME\" of the Homes, others refer to a rallying point for the clan, like \"CRUACHAN\" of the Campbells, some slogans refer to a prominent clansman like the Maclean \"Fear eile airson Eachuinn\" (\"Another for Hector\"). In at least one case, a patron saint is used as a slogan, as in \"St Bennet and Set On\" of the Setons. The arms of Grant use two slogans (or mottoes): \"CRAIG ELACHAIDH\" (which appears above the crest), and \"STANDFAST\" (which appears beneath on a scroll beneath the shield). Sometimes a clan chief's slogan appears on his crest badge and in consequence on the crest badges worn by his clan members. In some cases the chief's slogan also appears on his standard, guidon and pinsel.\n\n"}

During its existence from 1985 to 2002, it was routinely criticized for its severity (often labeled \"draconian\") and its effects on the local music scene and industry. After several unsuccessful attempts to repeal it through lobbying and later court action, it was finally repealed and replaced with the All-ages Dance Ordinance.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1985, teen dances were unregulated in Seattle. Activities at underage clubs were attracting the attention of the public and a club called The Monastery was particularly notorious for allegations of sexual abuse, child prostitution, and drug and alcohol use. The Monastery was run by George Freeman and was ostensibly a non-profit church of the Universal Life Church, whose dance events were \"religious services\". During daytime hours it was a youth center that attracted runaways and homeless youth. The Teen Dance Ordinance (TDO) was conceived and passed the City Council on July 29, 1985 to stop abuses at underage clubs. It was amended in 1988. Key among its provisions were:\n\n\nWith these requirements, teen dances outside of schools were virtually banned in the city, as no promoter would undertake the costs involved. For a city the size of Seattle, shows that would only allow 15- to 20-year-olds could not draw a large enough crowd for the event to break even. In addition to the $1 million insurance bond, hiring off-duty officers was a huge expense. The non-profit exemption meant the ordinance did not apply to the Monastery; it was closed using pre-existing civil abatement laws. In the 15 years of the ordinance, almost no one applied for a promoter's license for youth events, and no one has been prosecuted with it.\n\nWhile the ordinance only regulated \"dances,\" the distinction between a concert and a dance was not outlined by law, and the police were accused of defining a dance so liberally that the dancing done in the audience of a concert was enough to qualify the entire event as a \"dance.\" All-ages concerts were thus subject to being shut down by police who were vigilant in making sure promoters did not skirt the law. As a result, some nationally touring acts refused to do shows in Seattle because they insisted on all-ages audiences. With Seattle becoming an epicenter for alternative rock and the grunge scene in the early 90's, teens had to go to neighboring cities to attend concerts and dances.\n\nProponents of the TDO said that the ordinance ensured the safety of underage patrons and discouraged gatherings where youth consumed drugs and alcohol. They also invoked the memory of the Monastery, where they said adults preyed upon vulnerable kids susceptible to offers of drugs or quick cash. Excluding adults from underage youth would, in their eyes, create a \"bubble of safety.\"\n\nThe repeal of the ordinance was a key goal of JAMPAC, a musicians' and promoters' political action committee founded by Krist Novoselic of Nirvana. Since its founding in 1995, the group lobbied the City Council to repeal the TDO.\n\nThe ordinance was a focal point for a vocal young activist community in Seattle, notably those consolidated as The All Ages Music Organization, and later by the Music and Youth Task Force, which allowed for youth and public officials to meet regularly to find resolution to conflicting points of view.\n\nA new ordinance proposed to replace the TDO was passed by the City Council in 2000, however it was quickly vetoed by Mayor Paul Schell. The veto caused JAMPAC to launch a suit against the City of Seattle, claiming that the TDO's virtual outlawing of dance infringed on the First Amendment right to free expression. A judge however ruled for the City on JAMPAC's suit in May 2002, claiming there was no infringement on the First Amendment and that the matter is a political one for the Council to decide, not the courts. Nevertheless, during the course of the suit, Schell was voted out of office (in the aftermath of the disastrous WTO meetings of 1999) and the new mayor Greg Nickels, a proponent of the bill, resubmitted the ordinance to the Council. The new All-ages Dance Ordinance, written by members of the Music and Youth Task Force, was passed on August 12, 2002, replacing the TDO.\n\nThe new provisions of the All-Ages Dance Ordinance (AADO) eased on restrictions to accommodate new youth events. They include:\n\nThe new rules, while more liberal than before, still disappointed many activists who pushed for the TDO's repeal. They viewed the new ordinance as only moderate changes to the rules and not liberal enough to actually encourage all ages shows. Proponents of the TDO also criticize the new AADO, saying the new all-ages events are now ignored by the police, and that the new law is confusing and ignored by unlicensed promoters. Raves have also been points of criticism; they have now been classified as \"concerts\" and are outside the scope of the ordinance while frequent use of MDMA by attendees have been reported.\n\nIn March 2006, in the aftermath of the Capitol Hill massacre where a gunman shot several partygoers after a rave, \"The Seattle Times\" editorialized against the new dance rules and called for the city's all-ages dance rules to be \"thoroughly re-examined and re-tooled.\" Local community leaders however have so-far ignored such pleas, noting that the incident was the work of a deranged gunman whose intent to kill could not be stopped with new city laws.\n\n\n"}

Brooks argued that meaning in poetry is irreducible, because \"a true poem is a simulacrum of reality...an experience rather than any mere statement about experience or any mere abstraction from experience.\" Brooks emphasized structure, tension, balance, and irony over meaning, statement, and subject matter. He relied on comparisons with non-verbal arts in order to shift discussion away from summarizable content:\nThe essential structure of a poem (as distinguished from the rational or logical structure of the 'statement' which we abstract from it) resembles that of architecture or painting: it is a pattern of resolved stresses. Or, to move closer still to poetry by considering the temporal arts, the structure of a poem resembles that of a ballet or musical composition. It is a pattern of resolutions and balances and harmonizations, developed through a temporal scheme.\nProper criticism responds with suppleness and delicacy to such patterns, rather than paraphrasing their propositional content.\n\nCentral to \"The Heresy of Paraphrase\" was a vigorous critique of conventional distinctions between form and content:\nThe structure meant is certainly not 'form' in the conventional sense in which we think of form as a kind of envelope which 'contains' the 'content.' The structure obviously is everywhere conditioned by the nature of the material which goes into the poem. The nature of the material sets the problem to be solved, and the solution is the ordering of the material...The relationship between the intellectual and the non-intellectual elements in a poem is actually far more intimate than the conventional accounts would represent it to be: the relationship is not that of an idea 'wrapped in emotion' or a 'prose-sense decorated by sensuous imagery.\n\nThough Brooks applied this theory to his reading of poetry from many periods, subsequent literary scholars have suggested that the doctrine was shaped by the aesthetics of modernist literature. They point out that the New Criticism emerged at the peak of T. S. Eliot's influence as both poet and critic. Archibald Macleish's \"Ars Poetica\" (written eleven years before \"\") is often cited as prefiguring Brooks' doctrine:\nA poem should be palpable and mute\nAs a globed fruit\n\nDumb\nAs old medallions to the thumb\n\nSilent as the sleeve-worn stone\nOf casement ledges where the moss has grown –\n\nA poem should be wordless\nAs the flight of birds\n\nA poem should be motionless in time\nAs the moon climbs\n\nLeaving, as the moon releases\nTwig by twig the night-entangled trees,\n\nLeaving, as the moon behind the winter leaves,\nMemory by memory the mind –\n\nA poem should be motionless in time\nAs the moon climbs\n\nA poem should be equal to:\nNot true\n\nFor all the history of grief\nAn empty doorway and a maple leaf\n\nFor love\nThe leaning grasses and two lights above the sea –\n\nA poem should not mean\nBut be. \n\nThough many of the aesthetic assumptions of the New Criticism are now challenged or dismissed, the \"heresy of paraphrase\" is still commonly used to refer to reductive or utilitarian approaches to poetry.\n"}

Old Norse means \"wand carrier\" or \"carrier of a magic staff\", and it continues Proto-Germanic , which is derived from a word for \"wand\" (Old Norse ). \"Vala\", on the other hand, is a literary form based on .\n\nAnother name for the is (plenty of knowing) indicating she knew , and . A practitioner of is known as a \"-woman\" or a \"-man\".\n\nA or \"-woman\" (with an Old English cognate, ) is a specialised ; a \"seer, one who sees\", from the Old Norse word or referring to prophesying and which is cognate with the present English word \"spy\", continuing Proto-Germanic and the Proto-Indo-European root *\"\" (to see, to observe) and consequently related to Latin (\"I see\") and Sanskrit and (, \"to see\").\n\nVǫlur practiced seiðr, spá and galdr, practices which encompassed shamanism, sorcery, prophecy and other forms of indigenous magic associated with women. Seiðr in particular had connotations of \"ergi\" (unmanliness), a serious offense in Norse society.\n\nHistorical and mythological depictions of vǫlur show that they were held in high esteem and believed to possess such powers that even the father of the gods, Odin himself, consulted a vǫlva to learn what the future had in store for the gods. Such an account is preserved in the \"Völuspá\", which roughly translates to \"Prophecy of the Vǫlva\". In addition to the unnamed seeress (possibly identical with Heiðr) in the \"Vǫluspá\", other examples of vǫlur in Norse literature include Gróa in \"Svipdagsmál\", Þórbjǫrgr in the \"Saga of Erik the Red\" and Huld in \"Ynglinga saga\".\n\nThe vǫlur were not considered to be harmless. The goddess who was most skilled in magic was Freyja, and she was not only a goddess of love, but also a warlike divinity who caused screams of anguish, blood and death, and what Freyja performed in Asgard, the world of the gods, the vǫlur tried to perform in Midgard, the world of men. The weapon of the vǫlva was not the spear, the axe or the sword, but instead they were held to influence battles with different means, and one of them was the wand, (see the section wands and weaving, below).\n\nThe earliest descriptions of Germanic prophetesses appear in Roman accounts about the Cimbri, whose priestesses were aged women dressed in white. They sacrificed the prisoners of war and sprinkled their blood in order to prophesy coming events.\n\nIn his \"Commentarii de Bello Gallico\" (1, 50) Julius Caesar writes in the course of clashes with Germanic tribesmen under Ariovistus (58 BCE):\nTacitus also writes about prophetesses among the Germanic peoples in his \"Histories\" 4, 61 - notably a certain Veleda: \"by ancient usage the Germans attributed to many of their women prophetic powers and, as the superstition grew in strength, even actual divinity.\"\n\nJordanes relates in his \"Getica\" (XXIV:121) of Gothic \"haliurunnas\", witches who were driven into exile by King Filimer when the Goths had settled in Oium (Ukraine). The name is possibly a corruption of a Gothic \"Halju-runnos\", meaning \"hell-runners\" or \"runners to the realm of the dead\". These witches were condemned to seek refuge far away and, according to this account, engendered the Huns.\n\nThe Lombard historian Paul the Deacon, who died in Southern Italy in the 790s, wrote on how his people once had departed from southern Scandinavia. He tells of a conflict between the early Lombards and the Vandals. The latter turned to one Godan (presumably Odin), while Gambara, the mother of the two Lombard chieftains Ibor and Aio, turned to Godan's spouse Frea (presumably Freyja/Frigg). Frea helped Gambara play a trick on Odin and thanks to the Gambara's good relations with the goddess, her people won the battle.\n\nA detailed eyewitness account of a human sacrifice by what may have been a vǫlva was given by Ahmad ibn Fadlan as part of his account of a diplomatic mission to Volga Bulgaria in 921. In his description of the funeral of a Scandinavian chieftain, a slave girl volunteers to die with her master. After ten days of festivities, she is stabbed to death by an old woman (a sort of priestess who is referred to as \"Angel of Death\") and burnt together with the deceased in his boat (see Oseberg Ship).\n\nIn Norse society, a vǫlva was an elderly woman who had released herself from the strong family bonds that normally surrounded women in Norse clans. She travelled the land, usually followed by a retinue of young people, and she was summoned in times of crisis. She had immense authority and she charged well for her services.\n\nIn addition, many aristocratic Viking women wanted to serve Freyja and represent her in Midgard. They married Viking warlords who had Odin as a role model, and they settled in great halls that were earthly representations of Valhalla. In these halls there were magnificent feasts with ritualized meals, and the visiting chieftains can be likened with the einherjar, the fallen warriors who fought bravely and were served drinks by Valkyries. However, the duties of the mistresses were not limited to serving mead to visiting guests, but they were also expected to take part in warfare by manipulating weaving tools magically when their spouses were out in battle. Scholars no longer believe that these women waited passively at home, and there is evidence for their magic activities both in archaeological finds and in Old Norse sources, such as the \"Darraðarljóð\".\n\nIt is difficult to draw a line between the aristocratic lady and the wandering vǫlva, but Old Norse sources present the vǫlva as more professional and she went from estate to estate selling her spiritual services. The vǫlva had greater authority than the aristocratic lady, but both were ultimately dependent on the benevolence of the warlord that they served. When they had been attached to a warlord, their authority depended on their personal competence and credibility.\n\nIn \"Flateyjarbók\", toward the end of \"Norna-Gests þáttr\", Norna-Gest states that \"spákonur traveled around the country-side and fore-told the fates of men.\"\n\nIn Landnámabók, a Volva named \"Þuríðr Sundafyllir\" gained the epithet of \"filler of inlets\" during a famine in Iceland, when she used her magic powers to fill the fjords with fish.\n\n\"The Saga of Eric the Red\" relates that the settlers in Greenland c. 1000 were suffering a time of starvation. In order to prepare for the future, the \"vǫlva Þórbjǫrgr lítilvǫlva\" (\"the little vǫlva\") was summoned. Before her arrival the whole household was thoroughly cleaned and prepared. The high seat, which was otherwise reserved for the master and his wife, was furnished with down pillows.\n\nThe vǫlva appeared in the evening, dressed in a foot-length blue or black cloak decked with gems to the hem. In her hand she wielded a wand, the symbolic distaff (\"seiðstafr\"), which was adorned with brass and decked with gems on the knob. In the saga of Örvar-Oddr, the seiðkona also wears a blue or black cloak and carries a distaff (a wand which allegedly has the power of causing forgetfulness in one who is tapped three times on the cheek by it). The colour of the cloak may be less significant than the fact that it was intended to signify the otherness of the seiðkona.\n\nThe \"Saga of Eric the Red\" further relates that around her neck she wore a necklace of glass pearls, and on her head she wore a headpiece of black lamb trimmed with white cat skin. Around her waist she wore a belt of amadou from which hung a large pouch, where she hid the tools that she used during the seiðr. On her feet she wore shoes of calfskin and the shoelaces had brass knobs in the ends, and on her hands she wore gloves of cat skin, which were white and fluffy inside.\n\nAs the vǫlva entered the room, she was hailed with reverence by the household, and then she was led to the high seat, where she was provided with dishes prepared only for her. She had a porridge made of goat milk and a dish made of hearts from all the kinds of animals at the homestead. She ate the dishes with a brass spoon and a knife whose point was broken off.\n\nThe vǫlva was to sleep at the farm during the night and the next day was reserved for her dance. In order to dance the seiðr, she needed special tools. First, she positioned herself on a special elevated platform and a group of young women sat down around her. The girls sang special songs intended to summon the powers that the vǫlva wished to communicate with. The session was a success because the vǫlva was permitted to see far into the future and the famine was averted.\n\nIn the prologue of the \"Prose Edda\", related by a vǫlva, the origin of Thor's wife Sif is detailed, where she is said to be a \"spákona\". Snorri contextually correlates Sif with the oracular seeress Sibyl on this basis.\n\nScandinavian archaeologists have discovered wands in about 40 female graves, and they have usually been discovered in rich graves with valuable grave offerings which shows that the vǫlvas belonged to the highest level of society.\n\nOne example is a grave in Fyrkat, Denmark which turned out to be the richest grave in the area. She had been buried in a wagon from which the wheels had been removed. She had been plainly clad in what was probably only a long dress. Around her toes, she had toe rings, which suggests that she was buried without shoes or only in sandals so that the rings showed. At her head, she had a Gotlandic buckle which may have been used as a box, and she also owned objects from Finland and Russia. At her feet, she had a box which contained her magic tools, comprising a pellet from an owl as well as small bones from birds and mammals, and in a pouch she had the seeds of Hyoscyamus niger (\"henbane\"). If such seeds are thrown into a fire, they produce a hallucinogenic smoke which causes a sense of flying. In the grave there was also a small silver amulet that represented a chair made from a stump. When such small silver chairs are discovered in graves, they always belong to a woman, and it is possible that they represented objects such as the platform where the vǫlva performed her rituals and Hlidskjalf from which Odin watched across the world.\n\nAnother notable grave was the Oseberg Ship in Norway that revealed two women who had received a sumptuous burial. One of the women was most likely a high-ranking lady who knew how to practice seiðr as she had been buried with a wand of wood. In the grave, there were also four cannabis seeds, which probably had been in the pillows that supported the corpses. Additional cannabis seeds were discovered in a small leather pouch.\n\nAround the ninth century, a vǫlva was buried with considerable splendour in Hagebyhöga in Östergötland, Sweden. In addition to being buried with her wand, she had received great riches which included horses, a wagon and an Arabian bronze pitcher. There was also a silver pendant which represents a woman with a broad necklace around her neck. This kind of necklace was only worn by the most prominent women during the Iron Age and some have interpreted it as Freyja's necklace, Brísingamen. The pendant may represent Freyja herself, the most prominent vǫlva of them all.\n\nIn Birka, a vǫlva and a warrior were once buried together. Above them, a spear was positioned in order to dedicate the dead couple to Odin. They had probably served Freyja and Odin, two deities of war, and he had done so with his spear and she with her wand.\n\nIn theory, invisible fetters and bonds could be controlled from a loom, and if a lady loosened a knot in the woof, she could liberate the leg of her hero. But if she tied a knot, she could stop the enemy from moving. The men may have fought on the battle field in sweat and blood, but in a spiritual way, their women took part. It is not by coincidence that archaeologists find weaving tools and weapons side by side.\n\nA distaff possessed magical powers, and in the world of the gods, the Norns twined the threads of fate. In \"Helgakviða Hundingsbana I\", norns arrive at the birth of Helgi Hundingsbane and twined his fate as a hero, and it is possible that these Norns were not divine beings but vǫlur. Many of the wands that have been excavated have a basket-like shape in the top, and they are very similar to distaffs used for spinning linen. One theory for the origin of the word seiðr is \"thread spun with a distaff\", and according to this theory, practicing magic was to send out spiritual threads. Since the Norsemen believed that the Norns controlled people's fate by spinning, it is very likely that they considered individual fates to be controllable with the same method.\n\nIt is not a coincidence that women are called \"peace-weavers\" in \"Beowulf\", and since Freyja had started the first war, it was on the part of the vǫlva to decide when to start wars by practicing magic. This is probably why Harald Bluetooth, who was at war with the Holy Roman Emperor apparently kept a vǫlva at Fyrkat.\n\nThe Wife's Lament could be a poem about a peace-weaver.\n\nToday, it is generally accepted among scholars that fertility was essential in Viking society, and the most famous find that testifies to such rites is a small phallic statuette that was found in Rällinge in Sweden in the early 20th century. The appearance of this statuette indicates that it was related to fertility rites and it is usually interpreted as Freyja's brother Freyr. Adam of Bremen tells of the phallic statue of Freyr in the Temple at Uppsala and of the ribald songs that were sung during the rituals. In \"Völsa þáttr\", there is an account on how a horse's penis was worshipped by a pagan family, an account that has connections with an old Indo-Aryan sacrificial rite.\n\nSome wands that have been excavated cannot be associated with distaffs, but instead appear to represent a phallus, and moreover the use of magic had close associations with sexuality in Old Norse society. In the \"Lokasenna\", due to his interest in seiðr, Loki is depicted accusing Odin of being \"ergi\", which suggests that he could be perceived as unmanly, cowardly and accepting the 'female' role in sexual intercourse. As early as 1902, an anonymous German scholar (he did not dare publish in his own name) wrote on how seiðr was connected with sex. He argued that the wand was an obvious phallic symbol and why magic should otherwise be considered taboo for men. It was possible that the magic practices included sexual rites. As early as 1920, it was noted that the name of the male magic practitioner Ragnvald Rettilbein referred to such practices, as \"rettilbein\" means \"straight member\".\n\nThe vǫlur were known for their art of seduction, which was one of the reasons why they were considered dangerous. One of the stanzas in \"Hávamál\" warns against sexual intercourse with a woman who is skilled in magic, because the one who does so runs the risk of being caught in a magic bond and also risks getting ill. Freyja, who is the mistress of seiðr, has a free sexual life that gives her a bad reputation in certain myths.\n\nOne of the methods for seducing men may have been the use of drugs. In Fyrkat, the grave of a vǫlva revealed the use of henbane, a drug which not only produces hallucinations but can also be a powerful aphrodisiac. If Freyja was the goddess of love in Asgard, the vǫlva was her counterpart in Midgard.\n\nThe vǫlur could also employ drums during their sessions as in Sami shamanism. All vǫlur were not surrounded by the same retinue and preparations as Þórbjǫrgr, but she could also perform the seiðr alone, which was called \"útiseta\" (literally, \"sitting out\"). This practice appears to have involved meditation or introspection, possibly for the purpose of divination. Blain (2001) sees it as an aspect of seiðr reminiscent of shamanism. The term is derived from a 13th-century Law of Iceland, which outlawed \"útiseta at vekja trǫll upp ok fremja heiðni\" \"sitting out to wake up trolls and practicing heathenry\". Although the theoretical legal punishment for this offense was death, nobody was convicted under it until a minor witch craze reached Iceland in the 17th century. Keyser (1854) describes it as \"a peculiar kind of sorcery [...] in which the magician sat out at night under the open sky [...] especially to inquire into the future\".\n\nDuring the Christianization of Norway, King Olaf Trygvasson had seidmen tied up and thrown on a skerry at ebb. Men who practiced sorcery or magic were not received with the same respect but killed like animals and tortured to death because they were dealing with a practice that was held to be in the domain of women. This offense was considered \"ergi\", \"unmanliness, sexually perverse\". The \"Heimskringla\" relates that Ragnvaldr Rettilbein, one of Harald Fairhair's sons by the Sami woman Snæfrid was a seiðmaðr. The king had him burnt to death inside a house with a large group of fellow male practitioners.\n\nIn \"Lokasenna\", Loki taunts Odin for having practiced magic on Samsø, something which was considered \"ergi\".\n\nIncreasing conversions to Christianity began to displace the Norse religion, leading to the disappearance of the vǫlur; aided by Church and civil laws enacted against them, as in this Anglo-Saxon Canon law:\n\nThey were persecuted and killed in the course of Christianization, which also led to an extreme polarization of the role of females in Germanic society.\n\nResurgence of the traditions of the vǫlur are apparent in Europe and the United States within Heathen reconstructionism and the Christian community.\n\nThe term Spaewife was used as the title for several fictional works: Robert Louis Stevenson's poem \"The Spaewife\"; John Galt's historical romance \"The Spaewife: A Tale of the Scottish Chronicles\"; and John Boyce's \"The Spaewife, or, The Queen's Secret\" (under the pen-name Paul Peppergrass).\n\nFrancis Melville describes a spae-wife as a type of elf in \"The Book of Faeries\".\nNo taller than a human finger, fairy spae wives are usually dressed in the clothes of a peasant. However, when properly summoned, the attire changes from common to magnificent: blue cloak with a gem-lined collar and black lambskin hood lined with catskin, calfskin boots, and catskin gloves. Like human spae wives, they can also predict the future, through runes, tea leaves and signs generated by natural phenomena, and are good healers. They are said to be descended from the erectors of the standing stones.\n\n\n"}
