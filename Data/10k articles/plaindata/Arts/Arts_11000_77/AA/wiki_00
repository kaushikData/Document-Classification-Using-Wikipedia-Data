{"id": "1921444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1921444", "title": "Affective fallacy", "text": "Affective fallacy\n\nAffective fallacy is a term from literary criticism used to refer to the supposed error of judging or evaluating a text on the basis of its emotional effects on a reader. The term was coined by W.K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley in 1949 as a principle of New Criticism which is often paired with their study of \"The Intentional Fallacy\". \n\nThe concept of affective fallacy is an answer to the idea of impressionistic criticism, which argues that the reader's response to a poem is the ultimate indication of its value. It is the antithesis of affective criticism, which is the practice of evaluating the effect that a literary work has on its reader or audience. The concept was presented after the authors had presented their paper on \"The Intentional Fallacy\".\n\nFirst defined in an article published in \"The Sewanee Review\" in 1949, the concept of an affective fallacy was most clearly articulated in \"The Verbal Icon\", Wimsatt's collection of essays published in 1954. Wimsatt used the term to refer to all forms of criticism that understood a text's effect upon the reader to be the primary route to analyzing the importance and success of that text. This definition of the fallacy, if strictly followed, touches on or wholly includes nearly all of the major modes of literary criticism, from Ovid's \"docere delictendo\" (to teach by delighting), Aristotle's catharsis, and Longinus's concept of \"transport\" to late-nineteenth century belles-lettres and the contemporary Chicago Critics. For Wimsatt, the fallacy led to a number of potential errors, most of them related to emotional relativism. A view of literature based on its putative emotional effects will always be vulnerable to mystification and subjectivity; Wimsatt singles out the belletristic tradition exemplified by critics such as Arthur Quiller-Couch and George Saintsbury as an instance of a type of criticism that relies on subjective impressions and is thus unrepeatable and unreliable.\n\nFor Wimsatt, as for all the New Critics, such impressionistic approaches pose both practical and theoretical problems. In practical terms, it makes reliable comparisons of different critics difficult, if not irrelevant. In this light, the affective fallacy ran afoul of the New Critics' desire to place literary criticism on a more objective and principled basis. On the theoretical plane, the critical approach denoted as affective fallacy was fundamentally unsound because it denied the iconicity of the literary text. New Critical theorists stressed the unique nature of poetic language, and they asserted that—in view of this uniqueness—the role of the critic is to study and elucidate the thematic and stylistic \"language\" of each text on its own terms, without primary reference to an outside context, whether of history, biography, or reader-response.\n\nIn practice, Wimsatt and the other New Critics were less stringent in their application of the theory than in their theoretical pronouncements. Wimsatt admitted the appropriateness of commenting on emotional effects as an entry into a text, as long as those effects were not made the focus of analysis.\n\nAs with many concepts of New Criticism, the concept of the affective fallacy was both controversial and, though widely influential, never accepted wholly by any great number of critics.\n\nThe first critiques of the concept came, naturally enough, from those academic schools against whom the New Critics were ranged in the 1940s and 1950s, principally the historical scholars and the remaining belletristic critics. Early commentary deplored the use of the word \"fallacy\" itself, which seemed to many critics unduly combative. More sympathetic critics, while still objecting to Wimsatt's tone, accepted as valuable and necessary his attempt to place criticism on a more objective basis.\n\nHowever, the extremism of Wimsatt's approach was ultimately judged untenable by a number of critics. Just as New Historicism repudiated the New Critics' rejection of historical context, so reader-response criticism arose partly from dissatisfaction with the concept of the text as icon. Reader-response critics denied that a text could have a quantifiable significance outside its being read and experienced by particular readers at particular moments. These critics rejected the idea of text as icon, focusing instead on the ramifications of the interaction between text and reader.\n\nWhile the term remains current as a warning against unsophisticated use of emotional response in analyzing texts, the theory underlying the term has been thoroughly eclipsed by more recent developments in criticism.\n\n\"The Affective Fallacy is a confusion between the poem and its results (what it is and what it does), a special case of epistemological skepticism [ ... which ...] begins by trying to derive the standard of criticism from the psychological effects of the poem and ends in impressionism and relativism [with the result that] the poem itself, as an object of specifically critical judgment, tends to disappear.\" \n\n\"The report of some readers ... that a poem or story induces in them vivid images, intense feelings, or heightened consciousness, is neither anything which can be refuted nor anything which it is possible for the objective critic to take into account.\" \n\nWimsatt and Beardsley on an ideal, objective criticism: \"It will not talk of tears, prickles or other physiological symptoms, of feeling angry, joyful, hot, cold, or intense, or of vaguer states of emotional disturbance, but of shades of distinction and relation between objects of emotion.\"\n\n\"The critic is not a contributor to statistical countable reports about the poem, but a teacher or explicator of meanings. His readers, if they are alert, will not be content to take what he says as testimony, but will scrutinize it as teaching.\"\n\n"}

She is the subject of the sculpture Alison Lapper Pregnant, which was on display in Trafalgar Square until late 2007. She and her son Parys feature in the ongoing BBC docuseries \"Child of Our Time.\n\nAlison Lapper was born without arms and with shortened legs, a condition called phocomelia. She was institutionalized in her infancy, and is still distant from her relatives.\n\nWhen she was fitted with artificial limbs, she experienced them only as an attempt to make her look less disconcerting instead of actually helping her. So she abandoned them and learned to live without external aids.\n\nAt the age of 19, Lapper left Chailey Heritage School and moved to London. She acquired a driving licence and a flat. Lapper studied in The Faculty of Arts and Architecture at the University of Brighton and graduated with a first class honours degree in Fine Art in 1994.\n\nLapper uses photography, digital imaging, and painting to, as she says, question physical normality and beauty, using herself as a subject. She is a member of the Association of Mouth and Foot Painting Artists of the World (AMFPA), having joined as a student member and receiving a full membership after her college graduation. One particular influence is the sculpture Venus de Milo, due to the physical similarities between the idealized classical female statue and Lapper's own body. She has taken part in various British exhibitions, including in the Royal Festival Hall. In May 2003, Lapper was awarded an MBE for her services for art.\n\nAfter she had given birth to her son Parys in 2000, she created an installation of photographs of herself with him. Lapper and her son have featured on the ongoing BBC television documentary \"Child of Our Time\". In 2006, she published her book \"My Life in My Hands\".\n\nShe posed for Marc Quinn for the sculpture \"Alison Lapper Pregnant\". Initially she refused to pose for Quinn. Lapper's hesitation was regarding the way in which Quinn depicted disability. She wanted to be sure the depiction was not of pity. Quinn expressed how statues where their limbs had fallen off were highly regarded and cherished. His intentions were to create art involving bodies born this way. When Quinn phoned a few months after the initial call, Lapper informed him she was now seven months pregnant. His reply was, \"That's even better!\" In November 1999, Lapper went to Quinn's studio to have the cast made.\n\nThe sculpture is made of Carrara marble. It occupied the fourth plinth in London's Trafalgar Square between September 2005 and late 2007. and a large replica featured in the 2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony.\n\nIn May 2003, Lapper was awarded MBE for services to art.\n\nIn July 2014, Lapper was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Brighton.\n\n"}

It was founded in 2013 by artist Alan J Lawson and Jacob Burda. The focal point of activities is an annual four day symposium. The symposium 'draws together participants from academia, the arts and business' and they have been held on the themes of 'home', 'representation', 'the self-portrait', 'ephemera' and 'landscape'. Previous guests have included the philosopher Sir Roger Scruton, the novelist Ian McEwan, the poet John Burnside, film maker Luc Jacquet and the art historian Andrew Graham-Dixon. Symposiums have been held in Switzerland, Scotland, and Italy.\n\nThe Fellowship aims to create a “dialogue between the disciplines” by having people 'talk and share ideas in a respectful spirit that makes a refreshing and uplifting contrast to the frenetic, angry tone of much contemporary discourse.' It has been described as being 'the antidote to too much time spent on social media in the digital age.' In addition to the annual symposium, the Fellowship provides ongoing financial support for young playwrights, writers and artists. In 2015 The Alpine Fellowship endowed the ‘Alpine Fellows’ programme at NYU ensuring financial support for students pursuing interdisciplinary research at the Graduate Level at NYU. The Fellowship is above all committed to supporting those who want to help us better understand and appreciate each other through cultural means. \n\nIn 2014 the Fellowship discussed the theme of 'representation' with contributions from the realms of academia, music and the visual arts. Philosophers emphasized the difficulties and dangers inherent in the subjectivist approach that regards the world as the 'mere' representation of the subject. Since 2015 the annual symposium has been held at the Fondazione Giorgio Cini, on the island of San Giorgio, Venice. The 2015 symposium convened over the theme 'authorittrato - self-expression in the age of instant communication'. Participants tried to trace the historical developments that occurred since Albrecht Dürer's self-portrait in 1500 to today's 'selfie-culture'. In 2016 the Fellowship convened on the topic of ‘Ephemera’ and the nature of time. Philosophers Luciano Floridi and Mark Wrathall spoke to underline the way our self-understanding is inextricably bound up with our understanding of time. In 2017 the Fellowship discussed the theme of 'landscape'. Amongst other things, virtual reality pioneer Nonny de la Pena gave a talk on 'virtual landscapes' that stirred much debate.\n\nThe Alpine Fellowship offers a number of cash prizes in support of the arts. These include a £3000 Writing Prize, a £3000 visual arts prize and an opportunity to produce and perform a play.\n\nThe Fellowship accepts and welcomes applications from people over the age of 18. It explicitly encourages people from all nationalities and cultural backgrounds to apply.\n\n"}

It is connected to Byres Road by a short linking lane beside Hillhead subway station and is noted for its bars, restaurants and a licensed cinema.\nThe Lane was not always the focus of West End cafe society. By the early 1970s, it was a run-down area of small residential and empty commercial properties. However, in 1976, the cost to renew the lease on the cramped property in Ruthven Lane that housed the Ubiquitous Chip restaurant forced the owner to look for new premises. 'The Chip', as it is locally known, moved to its current location in a derelict property that had been the stables for a funeral undertaker. The move was a gamble for the owner, Ronnie Clydesdale, since the Lane was a backwater to the thriving Byres Rd but in 1977 the Glasgow Subway closed for a major refurbishment. This forced several small businesses to relocate from Byres Rd and the then-famous Grosvenor Cafe followed The Chip into Ashton Lane.\n\nOther bars and restaurants were opened: the Cul-de-Sac creperie in the former Barr and Stroud factory and Bar Brel in the old coachhouse that had been used latterly as a landscape gardener's yard but was, in 1910, the chauffeur’s house and garage for Dr Marion Gilchrist’s 'prim dark green Wolseley landaulette'. Dr Gilchrist (1864-1952) was, in 1894, the first woman to graduate in medicine in Scotland.\n\nThe Grosvenor Picture Theatre was built on site of Henderson’s Cab and Funeral Office in Byres Road and Ashton Lane. The cinema opened on 3 May 1921 with 'Helen of the Four Gates' and 'Eastwards Ho' and the performances were accompanied by the theatre’s own orchestra and organist. The building was designed by architects Gardner & Glen and had a distinctive terracotta façade. The original entrance faced Byres Road and the upper level housed a Café and American Soda Fountain and, by 1929, a waiting room. The original cinema seated around 1,350 people, but in the 1970s it underwent considerable reconstruction. The entrance was moved from Byres Rd to Ashton Lane, and the old entrance became Bonham's Wine Bar (the railing in the original foyer is retained in the upstairs bar). After falling into disrepair, the cinema closed 30 June 2002, but was relaunched in October 2003 after a multimillion-pound refurbishment. This created two screens on the ground floor, a bar and restaurant in the former neglected roof space and a new cafe/bar on Ashton Lane. The cinema now has two screens, each seating a hundred people and shows a mix of blockbuster and art-house movies. \n\nToday, bars and restaurants occupy most of the premises in Ashton Lane. The Famous Grosvenor Cafe and the now internationally renowned 'Chip' remain a defining feature. Some like Jinty McGuintys Irish Bar have been there a while too, almost 25 years.\n\nAshton Lane continues north as Cresswell Lane, where the variety of bars and restaurants is supplemented by a gallery of small specialist shops. The Lane and its surroundings might then be regarded as Glasgow's equivalent of Dublin's Temple Bar area or Edinburgh's Rose Street. While still popular with local residents and students, it is now firmly established on the Glasgow tourist trail.\n"}

This hand-application had to be repeated for each sheet of paper that was printed.\n\nThe best-known examples of bokashi are in the 19th-century \"ukiyo-e\" works of Hokusai and Hiroshige, in which the fading of Prussian blue dyes in skies and water create an illusion of depth.

Book art has existed for thousands of years, and can be seen in Egyptian papyri, Chinese, Japanese and Korean scrolls and books, Mesoamerican codices, and in one form or another, through all human history. In an interview within Cathy Courtney's book \"Speaking of Book Art,\" book artist Helen Douglas discusses her knowledge of \"livres d' artiste\" and twentieth-century Russian books as examples of book art from previous generations. Later in the interview Douglas continues to write about the genre of Book Art stating that \"...you can talk about a \"painting\" and \"sculpture\" you should be able to talk about \"book\".\" The term \"Book Arts\" refers to the creative and craft disciplines used to produce book art, such as printing, printmaking, papermaking, typography and bookbinding. As a field of contemporary art, Book Art has seen an explosive growth since the 1960s.\n\nSince the 1980s many college Book Art programs have evolved, including MFA programs at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa and a MFA in Book Art and Creative Writing Mills College in Oakland, CA.

It is the sequel to the family comedy film \"Cheaper by the Dozen\" (2003). Shawn Levy, the director of the first film, did not return as director for this one, which was instead directed by Adam Shankman (\"The Pacifier\"). Levy was a producer of it and made an appearance as a hospital intern in it. Steve Martin, Bonnie Hunt, Hilary Duff, Piper Perabo, Alyson Stoner, and Tom Welling reprise their roles as members of the twelve-child Baker family. Eugene Levy co-stars as the patriarch of a rival family of eight children. Carmen Electra portrays his wife.\n\nTwo years after Tom Baker resigned from his head coaching position, his family begins to undergo many changes, beginning with Lorraine and her desire to study in New York. Their oldest daughter, Nora, is now married to Bud McNulty and heavily pregnant with their first child. They intend to move to Houston because of his new job promotion.\n\nFeeling the family is breaking apart as the children grow up and move away, Tom persuades them to take one last family vacation all together at Lake Winnetka. Tom's old rival, Jimmy Murtaugh, and his large family (with \"only\" eight kids) are also there for the summer. He constantly flaunts his wealth and success to Tom, as well as the accomplishments of his children, often suggesting to Tom that his are less successful because of his parenting style. They get into many incidents, several of which are accidental: Mark Baker, along with Kenny Murtaugh, crashes into a tennis court with a golf cart, Sarah Baker is caught shoplifting in a gift shop, and Mark accidentally sets off a backpack of fireworks, causing widespread panic, especially when it is thrown into a boat, igniting its engine and causing it to explode.\n\nJimmy again starts the topic that Tom needs to use a firmer hand on his kids. He is angered by this, and they decide to settle the matter at the Annual Labor Day Family Cup. He trains the kids for days, not realizing they are miserable. Sarah and Elliot Murtaugh watch \"Ice Age\" together, but are spied on by their fathers, which ultimately results in them getting into an argument and humiliating their children. Upon returning home, Sarah is furious and refuses to compete for Tom in the Cup. Everyone, including Kate, is angry with him, not only for spying on Sarah, but also for ruining the entire trip through his competitiveness with the Murtaughs.\n\nThe next morning, Tom goes to the Cup to compete with Nigel and Kyle (the only two still willing to go). However, after discovering an old \"Team Baker\" flag, Kate and the rest of the kids show up, showing they forgive him and are willing to compete. After the events, however, the Bakers and the Murtaughs are tied for first; a tiebreaking canoe race is announced, in which every family member must compete. During it, Nora goes into labor; the Murtaughs want to help, but Jimmy, sensing the opportunity to defeat Tom once and for all, initially refuses to do so. Eventually, his family convince him that he should help the Bakers, and the Bakers and the Murtaughs work together to get Nora to the hospital. Bud, Lorraine, and Kate go with her in the delivery room, while Tom, Jimmy, Sarina, and the rest of the kids stay in the waiting room. While talking to Jimmy, Tom realizes that he has to let his kids grow, but wherever they go, they will always be with him, and he will always be with them. Nora then gives birth to a baby boy who she and Bud name Tom in honor of his grandfather, who has shown them \"there is no way to be a perfect parent, but a million ways to be a really good one.\" Bud announces that they have bought \"The Big House\", the vacation home that the Bakers have been renting. Nora, Bud, and baby Tom leave for Houston a few days later while the Bakers continue their vacation at Lake Winnetka.\n\n\n\nReview aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes ranked \"Cheaper by the Dozen 2\" 98th in the 100 worst reviewed films of the 2000s, with a rating of 6% based on 93 reviews of the film. The site's consensus reads \" A sequel to a remake, \"Cheaper 2\" wastes its solid cast in scenes of over-the-top, predictable humor\". On Metacritic, it has a score of 34 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".\n\n\"Chicago Sun-Times\" critic Roger Ebert, gave the film one of its rare positive reviews, awarding it 3/4 stars and stating \"As I watched this sequel, a certain good feeling began to make itself known. Yes, the movie is unnecessary. However, it is unnecessary at a higher level of warmth and humor than the recent remake \"Yours, Mine, and Ours\".\" Ebert also highly praised Alyson Stoner's performance, favorably comparing the then-twelve year old actress to Reese Witherspoon.\n\nCalling the overall film \"bland\", \"Variety\"'s Justin Chang agreed with Ebert on Stoner, calling her \"an endearingly vulnerable standout\" and deeming her subplot to be \"the most engaging\" in it. Chang was also kind to Steve Martin, Bonnie Hunt and Eugene Levy, deeming the veteran actors did the best with what was given to them. Marrit Ingman of the \"Austin Chronicle\" conceded that it had a good message, and agreed that Hunt was \"marvelous and down-to-earth\" but ultimately felt that \"the rest of the movie is as funny as mildew\", found that \"the product placement is particularly egregious\" and thought that Hilary Duff looked \"as tanned and raw as buffalo jerky\". Andrea Gronvall was also horrified by Duff's appearance while writing for the \"Chicago Reader\", calling her \"haggard\" and \"flat-out scary\", and overall felt that there was \"a discernible lack of enthusiasm from almost everyone involved\", however singling out Carmen Electra for being \"the most winning performer of the bunch\".\n\nThe film received two Razzie Award nominations including Worst Actress (Hilary Duff) and Worst Supporting Actor (Eugene Levy).\n\nThe film grossed $9,309,387 million opening weekend, finishing in 4th place at the box office. By the end of its run, \"Cheaper by the Dozen 2\" grossed $82,571,173 domestically and $46,610,657 internationally, totaling $129,181,830 worldwide. It is one of only twelve feature films to be released in over 3,000 theaters and still improve on its box office performance in its second weekend, increasing 55.6% from $9,309,387 to $14,486,519.\n\nThe DVD was released on May 23, 2006. The Blu-ray was released on January 5, 2010. The DVD is two-sided and side B has an inside look previews of \"Flicka\" and \"Aquamarine\".\n\n"}
{"id": "10791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10791", "title": "Cinema of China", "text": "Cinema of China\n\nThe cinema of China is one of three distinct historical threads of Chinese-language cinema together with the cinema of Hong Kong and the cinema of Taiwan.\n\nCinema was introduced in China in 1896 and the first Chinese film, \"The Battle of Dingjunshan\", was made in 1905, with the film industry being centered on Shanghai in the first decades. The first sound film, \"Sing-Song Girl Red Peony\", using the sound-on-disc technology, was made in 1931. The 1930s, considered the first \"golden period\" of Chinese cinema, saw the advent of the Leftist cinematic movement and the dispute between Nationalists and Communists was reflected in the films produced. After the Japanese invasion of China and the occupation of Shanghai, the industry in the city was severely curtailed, with filmmakers moving to Hong Kong, Chongqing and other places, starting a \"Solitary Island\" period in Shanghai, referring to the city's foreign concessions, with the remaining filmmakers working there. \"Princess Iron Fan\" (1941), the first Chinese animated feature film, was released at the end of this period. It influenced wartime Japanese animation and later Osamu Tezuka. After being completely engulfed by the occupation in 1941, and until the end of the war in 1945, the film industry in the city was under Japanese control.\n\nAfter the end of the war, a second golden age took place, with production in Shanghai resuming, with films such as \"Spring in a Small Town\" (1948), named the best Chinese-language film at the 24th Hong Kong Film Awards. After the communist revolution in 1949, previous and some foreign films were banned in 1951, and movie attendance increased sharply. During the Cultural Revolution, the film industry was severely restricted, coming almost to a standstill from 1967 to 1972. The industry flourished following the end of the Cultural Revolution, including the \"scar dramas\" of the 1980s, such as \"Evening Rain\" (1980), \"Legend of Tianyun Mountain\" (1980) and \"Hibiscus Town\" (1986), depicting the emotional traumas left by the period. Starting in the mid to late 1980s, with films such as \"One and Eight\" (1983) and \"Yellow Earth\" (1984), the rise of the Fifth Generation brought increased popularity to Chinese cinema abroad, especially among Western arthouse audiences, with films like \"Red Sorghum\" (1987), \"The Story of Qiu Ju\" (1992) and \"Farewell My Concubine\" (1993) winning major international awards. The movement partially ended after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. The post-1990 period saw the rise of the Sixth Generation and post-Sixth Generation, both mostly making films outside the main Chinese film system and played mostly on the international film festival circuit.\n\nFollowing the international commercial success of films such as \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" (2000) and \"Hero\" (2002), the number of co-productions in Chinese-language cinema has increased and there has been a movement of Chinese-language cinema into a domain of large scale international influence. After \"The Dream Factory\" (1997) demonstrated the viability of the commercial model, and with the growth of the Chinese box office in the new millennium, Chinese films have broken box office records and, as of January 2017, 5 of the top 10 highest-grossing films in China are domestic productions. \"Lost in Thailand\" (2012) was the first Chinese film to reach at the Chinese box office, \"Monster Hunt\" (2015) was the first to reach , \"The Mermaid\" (2016) was the first to and \"Wolf Warrior 2\" (2017) is currently the highest-grossing film in China.\n\nChina is the home of the largest movie & drama production complex and film studios in the world, the Oriental Movie Metropolis and Hengdian World Studios, and in 2010 it had the third largest film industry by number of feature films produced annually. In 2012 the country became the second-largest market in the world by box office receipts. In 2016, the gross box office in China was (). The country has the largest number of screens in the world since 2016, and is expected to become the largest theatrical market by 2019. China has also become a major hub of business for Hollywood studios.\n\nIn November 2016, China passed a film law banning content deemed harmful to the “dignity, honor and interests” of the People’s Republic and encouraging the promotion of “socialist core values\", approved by the National People’s Congress Standing Committee.\n\nMotion pictures were introduced to China in 1896. The first recorded screening of a motion picture in China occurred in Shanghai on August 11, 1896, as an \"act\" on a variety bill. The first Chinese film, a recording of the Peking opera, \"The Battle of Dingjunshan\", was made in November 1905 in Beijing. For the next decade the production companies were mainly foreign-owned, and the domestic film industry was centered on Shanghai, a thriving entrepot and the largest city in the Far East. In 1913, the first independent Chinese screenplay, \"The Difficult Couple\", was filmed in Shanghai by Zheng Zhengqiu and Zhang Shichuan. Zhang Shichuan then set up the first Chinese-owned film production company in 1916. The first truly successful home-grown feature film was \"Yan Ruisheng\" () released in 1921. During the 1920s film technicians from the United States trained Chinese technicians in Shanghai, and American influence continued to be felt there for the next two decades.\n\nIt was during this period that some of the more important production companies first came into being, notably Mingxing (\"Star\") and the Shaw brothers' Tianyi (\"Unique\"). Mingxing, founded by Zheng Zhengqiu and Zhang Shichuan in 1922, initially focused on comic shorts, including the oldest surviving complete Chinese film, \"Laborer's Love\" (1922). This soon shifted, however, to feature-length films and family dramas including \"Orphan Rescues Grandfather\" (1923). Meanwhile, Tianyi shifted their model towards folklore dramas, and also pushed into foreign markets; their film \"White Snake\" (1926) proved a typical example of their success in the Chinese communities of Southeast Asia. In 1931, the first Chinese sound film \"Sing-Song Girl Red Peony\" was made, the product of a cooperation between the Mingxing Film Company's image production and Pathé Frères's sound technology. However, the sound was disc-recorded, and the first sound-on-film talkie made in China was either \"Spring on Stage\" (歌場春色) by Tianyi, or \"Clear Sky After Storm\" by Great China Studio and Jinan Studio.\n\nHowever, the first truly important Chinese films were produced beginning in the 1930s, with the advent of the \"progressive\" or \"left-wing\" movement, like Cheng Bugao's \"Spring Silkworms\" (1933), Wu Yonggang's \"The Goddess\" (1934), and Sun Yu's \"The Big Road\" (1935). These films were noted for their emphasis on class struggle and external threats (i.e. Japanese aggression), as well as on their focus on common people, such as a family of silk farmers in \"Spring Silkworms\" and a prostitute in \"The Goddess\". In part due to the success of these kinds of films, this post-1930 era is now often referred to as the first \"golden period\" of Chinese cinema. The Leftist cinematic movement often revolved around the Western-influenced Shanghai, where filmmakers portrayed the struggling lower class of an overpopulated city.\n\nThree production companies dominated the market in the early to mid- 1930s: the newly formed Lianhua (\"United China\"), the older and larger Mingxing and Tianyi. Both Mingxing and Lianhua leaned left (Lianhua's management perhaps more so), while Tianyi continued to make less socially conscious fare.\n\nThe period also produced the first big Chinese movie stars, such as Hu Die, Ruan Lingyu, Li Lili, Chen Yanyan, Zhou Xuan, Zhao Dan and Jin Yan. Other major films of the period include \"Love and Duty\" (1931), \"Little Toys\" (1933), \"New Women\" (1934), \"Song of the Fishermen\" (1934), \"Plunder of Peach and Plum\" (1934), \"Crossroads\" (1937), and \"Street Angel\" (1937). Throughout the 1930s, the Nationalists and the Communists struggled for power and control over the major studios; their influence can be seen in the films the studios produced during this period.\n\nThe Japanese invasion of China in 1937, in particular the Battle of Shanghai, ended this golden run in Chinese cinema. All production companies except Xinhua Film Company (\"New China\") closed shop, and many of the filmmakers fled Shanghai, relocating to Hong Kong, the wartime Nationalist capital Chongqing, and elsewhere. The Shanghai film industry, though severely curtailed, did not stop however, thus leading to the \"Solitary Island\" period (also known as the \"Sole Island\" or \"Orphan Island\"), with Shanghai's foreign concessions serving as an \"island\" of production in the \"sea\" of Japanese-occupied territory. It was during this period that artists and directors who remained in the city had to walk a fine line between staying true to their leftist and nationalist beliefs and Japanese pressures. Director Bu Wancang's \"Mulan Joins the Army\" (1939), with its story of a young Chinese peasant fighting against a foreign invasion, was a particularly good example of Shanghai's continued film-production in the midst of war. This period ended when Japan declared war on the Western allies on December 7, 1941; the solitary island was finally engulfed by the sea of the Japanese occupation. With the Shanghai industry firmly in Japanese control, films like the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere-promoting \"Eternity\" (1943) were produced. At the end of World War II, one of the most controversial Japanese-authorized company, Manchukuo Film Association, would be separated and integrated into Chinese cinema.\n\nThe film industry continued to develop after 1945. Production in Shanghai once again resumed as a new crop of studios took the place that Lianhua and Mingxing had occupied in the previous decade. In 1946, Cai Chusheng returned to Shanghai to revive the Lianhua name as the \"Lianhua Film Society.\" This in turn became Kunlun Studios which would go on to become one of the most important studios of the era, putting out the classics \"The Spring River Flows East\" (1947), \"Myriad of Lights\" (1948), \"Crows and Sparrows\" (1949) and \"San Mao, The Little Vagabond\" (1949).\nMany of these films showed the disillusionment with the oppressive rule of Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Party. \"The Spring River Flows East\", a three-hour-long two-parter directed by Cai Chusheng and Zheng Junli, was a particularly strong success. Its depiction of the struggles of ordinary Chinese during the Second Sino-Japanese war, replete with biting social and political commentary, struck a chord with audiences of the time.\n\nMeanwhile, companies like the Wenhua Film Company (\"Culture Films\"), moved away from the leftist tradition and explored the evolution and development of other dramatic genres. Wenhua treated postwar problems in universalistic and humanistic ways, avoiding the family narrative and melodramatic formulae. Excellent examples of Wenhua's fare are its first two postwar features, \"Unending Emotions\" (1947) and \"Fake Bride, Phony Bridegroom\" (1947). Another memorable Wenhua film is \"Long Live the Missus\" (1947), like \"Unending Emotions\" with an original screenplay by writer Eileen Chang. Wenhua's romantic drama \"Spring in a Small Town\" (1948), a film by director Fei Mu shortly prior to the revolution, is often regarded by Chinese film critics as one of the most important films in the history of Chinese cinema, with it being named by the Hong Kong Film Awards in 2004 as the greatest Chinese-language film ever made. Ironically, it was precisely its artistic quality and apparent lack of \"political grounding\" that led to its labeling by the Communists as rightist or reactionary, and the film was quickly forgotten by those on the mainland following the Communist victory in China in 1949. However, with the China Film Archive's re-opening after the Cultural Revolution, a new print was struck from the original negative, allowing \"Spring of the Small Town\" to find a new and admiring audience and to influence an entire new generation of filmmakers. Indeed, an acclaimed remake was made in 2002 by Tian Zhuangzhuang. \"Remorse at Death\" (1948), by the same director, was the first Chinese color film.\n\nWith the communist revolution in China in 1949, the government saw motion pictures as an important mass production art form and tool for propaganda. Starting from 1951, pre-1949 Chinese films, Hollywood and Hong Kong productions were banned as the Communist Party of China sought to tighten control over mass media, producing instead movies centering on peasants, soldiers and workers, such as \"Bridge\" (1949) and \"The White Haired Girl\" (1950). One of the production bases in the middle of all the transition was the Changchun Film Studio.\n\nThe private studios in Shanghai, including Kunming, Wenhua, Guotai and Datong, were encouraged to make new films from 1949 to 1951. They made approximately 47 films during this period, but soon ran into trouble, owing to the furore over the Kunlun-produced drama \"The Life of Wu Xun\" (1950), directed by Sun Yu and starring veteran Zhao Dan. The feature was accused in an anonymous article in \"People's Daily\" in May 1951 of spreading feudal ideas. After the article was revealed to be penned by Mao Zedong, the film was banned, a Film Steering Committee was formed to \"re-educate\" the film industry and within two years, these private studios were all incorporated into the state-run Shanghai Film Studio.\n\nThe Communist regime solved the problem of a lack of film theaters by building mobile projection units which could tour the remote regions of China, ensuring that even the poorest could have access to films. By 1965 there were around 20,393 such units. The number of movie-viewers hence increased sharply, partly bolstered by the fact that film tickets were given out to work units and attendance was compulsory, with admissions rising from 47 million in 1949 to 4.15 billion in 1959. In the 17 years between the founding of the People's Republic of China and the Cultural Revolution, 603 feature films and 8,342 reels of documentaries and newsreels were produced, sponsored mostly as Communist propaganda by the government. For example, in \"Guerrilla on the Railroad\" (铁道游击队), dated 1956, the Chinese Communist Party was depicted as the primary resistance force against the Japanese in the war against invasion. Chinese filmmakers were sent to Moscow to study the Soviet socialist realism style of filmmaking. In 1956, the Beijing Film Academy was opened. One important film of this era is \"This Life of Mine\" (1950), directed by Shi Hu, which follows an old beggar reflecting on his past life as a policeman working for the various regimes since 1911. The first widescreen Chinese film was produced in 1960. Animated films using a variety of folk arts, such as papercuts, shadow plays, puppetry, and traditional paintings, also were very popular for entertaining and educating children. The most famous of these, the classic \"Havoc in Heaven\" (two parts, 1961, 4), was made by Wan Laiming of the Wan Brothers and won Outstanding Film award at the London International Film Festival.\n\nThe thawing of censorship in 1956–57 (known as the Hundred Flowers Campaign) and the early 1960s led to more indigenous Chinese films being made which were less reliant on their Soviet counterparts. During this campaign the sharpest criticisms came from the satirical comedies of Lü Ban. \"Before the New Director Arrives\" exposes the hierarchical relationships occurring between the cadres, while his next film, \"The Unfinished Comedy\" (1957), was labelled as a \"poisonous weed\" during the Anti-Rightist Movement and Lü banned was from directing for life.\"The Unfinished Comedy\" was only screened after Mao's death. Other noteworthy films produced during this period were adaptations of literary classics, such as Sang Hu's \"The New Year's Sacrifice\" (1956; adapted from a Lu Xun story) and Shui Hua's \"The Lin Family Shop\" (1959; adapted from a Mao Dun story). The most prominent filmmaker of this era was Xie Jin, whose three films in particular, \"Woman Basketball Player No. 5\" (1957), \"The Red Detachment of Women\" (1961) and \"Two Stage Sisters\" (1964), exemplify China's increased expertise at filmmaking during this time. Films made during this period are polished and exhibit high production value and elaborate sets. While Beijing and Shanghai remained the main centers of production, between 1957–60 the government built regional studios in Guangzhou, Xi'an and Chengdu to encourage representations of ethnic minorities in films. Chinese cinema began to directly address the issue of such ethnic minorities during the late 1950s and early 1960s, in films like \"Five Golden Flowers\" (1959), \"Third Sister Liu\" (1960), \"Serfs\" (1963), \"Ashima\" (1964).\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, the film industry was severely restricted. Almost all previous films were banned, and only a few new ones were produced, the so-called \"revolutionary model operas\". The most notable of these was a ballet version of the revolutionary opera \"The Red Detachment of Women\", directed by Pan Wenzhan and Fu Jie in 1970. Feature film production came almost to a standstill in the early years from 1967 to 1972. Movie production revived after 1972 under the strict jurisdiction of the Gang of Four until 1976, when they were overthrown. The few films that were produced during this period, such as 1975's \"Breaking with Old Ideas\", were highly regulated in terms of plot and characterization.\n\nIn the years immediately following the Cultural Revolution, the film industry again flourished as a medium of popular entertainment. Production rose steadily, from 19 features in 1977 to 125 in 1986. Domestically produced films played to large audiences, and tickets for foreign film festivals sold quickly. The industry tried to revive crowds by making more innovative and \"exploratory\" films like their counterparts in the West.\n\nIn the 1980s the film industry fell on hard times, faced with the dual problems of competition from other forms of entertainment and concern on the part of the authorities that many of the popular thriller and martial arts films were socially unacceptable. In January 1986 the film industry was transferred from the Ministry of Culture to the newly formed Ministry of Radio, Cinema, and Television to bring it under \"stricter control and management\" and to \"strengthen supervision over production.\"\n\nThe end of the Cultural Revolution brought the release of \"scar dramas\", which depicted the emotional traumas left by this period. The best-known of these is probably Xie Jin's \"Hibiscus Town\" (1986), although they could be seen as late as the 1990s with Tian Zhuangzhuang's \"The Blue Kite\" (1993). In the 1980s, open criticism of certain past Communist Party policies was encouraged by Deng Xiaoping as a way to reveal the excesses of the Cultural Revolution and the earlier Anti-Rightist Campaign, also helping to legitimize Deng's new policies of \"reform and opening up.\" For instance, the Best Picture prize in the inaugural 1981 Golden Rooster Awards was given to two \"scar dramas\", \"Evening Rain\" (Wu Yonggang, Wu Yigong, 1980) and \"Legend of Tianyun Mountain\" (Xie Jin, 1980).\n\nMany scar dramas were made by members of the Fourth Generation whose own careers or lives had suffered during the events in question, while younger, Fifth Generation directors such as Tian tended to focus on less controversial subjects of the immediate present or the distant past. Official enthusiasm for scar dramas waned by the 1990s when younger filmmakers began to confront negative aspects of the Mao era. \"The Blue Kite\", though sharing a similar subject as the earlier scar dramas, was more realistic in style, and was made only through obfuscating its real script. Shown abroad, it was banned from release in mainland China, while Tian himself was banned from making any films for nearly a decade afterward. After the events of June 4, 1989 in Tiananmen Square, few if any scar dramas were released domestically in mainland China.\n\nBeginning in the mid-late 1980s, the rise of the so-called Fifth Generation of Chinese filmmakers brought increased popularity of Chinese cinema abroad. Most of the filmmakers who made up the Fifth Generation had graduated from the Beijing Film Academy in 1982 and included Zhang Yimou, Tian Zhuangzhuang, Chen Kaige, Zhang Junzhao and others. These graduates constituted the first group of filmmakers to graduate since the Cultural Revolution and they soon jettisoned traditional methods of storytelling and opted for a more free and unorthodox approach. After the so-called scar literature in fiction had paved the way for frank discussion, Zhang Junzhao's \"One and Eight\" (1983) and Chen Kaige's \"Yellow Earth\" (1984) in particular were taken to mark the beginnings of the Fifth Generation. The most famous of the Fifth Generation directors, Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou, went on to produce celebrated works such as \"King of the Children\" (1987), \"Ju Dou\" (1989), \"Farewell My Concubine\" (1993) and \"Raise the Red Lantern\" (1991), which were not only acclaimed by Chinese cinema-goers but by the Western arthouse audience. Tian Zhuangzhuang's films, though less well known by Western viewers, were well noted by directors such as Martin Scorsese. It was during this period that Chinese cinema began reaping the rewards of international attention, including the 1988 Golden Bear for \"Red Sorghum\", the 1992 Golden Lion for \"The Story of Qiu Ju\", the 1993 Palme d'Or for \"Farewell My Concubine\", and three Best Foreign Language Film nominations from the Academy Awards. All these award-winning films starred actress Gong Li, who became the Fifth Generation's most recognizable star, especially to international audiences.\n\nDiverse in style and subject, the Fifth Generation directors' films ranged from black comedy (Huang Jianxin's \"The Black Cannon Incident\", 1985) to the esoteric (Chen Kaige's \"Life on a String\", 1991), but they share a common rejection of the socialist-realist tradition worked by earlier Chinese filmmakers in the Communist era. Other notable Fifth Generation directors include Wu Ziniu, Hu Mei, Li Shaohong and Zhou Xiaowen. Fifth Generation filmmakers reacted against the ideological purity of Cultural Revolution cinema. By relocating to regional studios, they began to explore the actuality of local culture in a somewhat documentary fashion. Instead of stories depicting heroic military struggles, the films were built out of the drama of ordinary people's daily lives. They also retained political edge, but aimed at exploring issues rather than recycling approved policy. While Cultural Revolution films used character, the younger directors favored psychological depth along the lines of European cinema. They adopted complex plots, ambiguous symbolism, and evocative imagery. Some of their bolder works with political overtones were banned by Chinese authorities.\n\nThese films came with a new style of shooting as well, directors utilized extensive color and long shots. As a result of the new films being so intricate, the films were for more educated audiences than anything. The new style was profitable for some and helped filmmakers to make strides in the business. It allowed directors to get away from reality and show their artistic sense.\n\nThe Fourth Generation also returned to prominence. Given their label after the rise of the Fifth Generation, these were directors whose careers were stalled by the Cultural Revolution and who were professionally trained prior to 1966. Wu Tianming, in particular, made outstanding contributions by helping to finance major Fifth Generation directors under the auspices of the Xi'an Film Studio (which he took over in 1983), while continuing to make films like \"Old Well\" (1986) and \"The King of Masks\" (1996).\n\nThe Fifth Generation movement ended in part after the 1989 Tiananmen Incident, although its major directors continued to produce notable works. Several of its filmmakers went into self-imposed exile: Wu Tianming moved to the United States (but later returned), Huang Jianxin left for Australia, while many others went into television-related works.\n\nIn 1987, the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television issued a statement encouraging the making of movies which emphasizes \"the main melody\" (主旋律) to \"invigorate national spirit and national pride\". These \"main melody\" films (主旋律电影), still produced regularly nowadays, try to emulate the commercial mainstream by the use of Hollywood-style music and special effects.\nThey are often subsidized by the state and have free access to government and military personnel. August 1st Film Studio, the film and TV production arm of the People's Liberation Army, is a studio which produces \"main melody\" cinema. \"Main melody\" films, which often depict past military engagements or are biopics of first-generation CCP leaders, have won several Best Picture prizes at the Golden Rooster Awards. Some of the more famous \"main melody\" dramas include the ten-hour epic \"Decisive Engagement\" (大决战, 1991), directed by Cai Jiawei, Yang Guangyuan and Wei Lian; \"The Opium War\" (1997), directed by Xie Jin; and \"The Founding of a Republic\" (2009), directed by Han Sanping and Fifth Generation director Huang Jianxin.\n\nThe post-1990 era has seen what some observers term the \"return of the amateur filmmaker\" as state censorship policies after the Tiananmen Square demonstrations produced an edgy underground film movement loosely referred to as the Sixth Generation. Owing to the lack of state funding and backing, these films were shot quickly and cheaply, using materials like 16 mm film and digital video and mostly non-professional actors and actresses, producing a documentary feel, often with long takes, hand-held cameras, and ambient sound; more akin to Italian neorealism and cinéma vérité than the often lush, far more considered productions of the Fifth Generation. Unlike the Fifth Generation, the Sixth Generation brings a more individualistic, anti-romantic life-view and pays far closer attention to contemporary urban life, especially as affected by disorientation, rebellion and dissatisfaction with China's contemporary social tensions. Many were made with an extremely low budget (an example is Jia Zhangke, who shoots on digital video, and formerly on 16 mm; Wang Xiaoshuai's \"The Days\" (1993) were made for US$10,000). The title and subjects of many of these films reflect the Sixth Generation's concerns. The Sixth Generation takes an interest in marginalized individuals and the less represented fringes of society. For example, Zhang Yuan's hand-held \"Beijing Bastards\" (1993) focuses on youth punk subculture, featuring artists like Cui Jian, Dou Wei and He Yong frowned upon by many state authorities, while Jia Zhangke's debut film \"Xiao Wu\" (1997) concerns a provincial pickpocket.\n\nAs the Sixth Generation gained international exposure, many subsequent movies were joint ventures and projects with international backers, but remained quite resolutely low-key and low budget. Jia's \"Platform\" (2000) was funded in part by Takeshi Kitano's production house, while his \"Still Life\" was shot on HD video. \"Still Life\" was a surprise addition and Golden Lion winner of the 2006 Venice International Film Festival. \"Still Life\", which concerns provincial workers around the Three Gorges region, sharply contrasts with the works of Fifth Generation Chinese directors like Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige who were at the time producing \"House of Flying Daggers\" (2004) and \"The Promise\" (2005). It featured no star of international renown and was acted mostly by non-professionals.\n\nMany Sixth Generation films have highlighted the negative attributes of China's entry into the modern capitalist market. Li Yang's \"Blind Shaft\" (2003) for example, is an account of two murderous con-men in the unregulated and notoriously dangerous mining industry of northern China. (Li refused the tag of Sixth Generation, although admitted he was not Fifth Generation). While Jia Zhangke's \"The World\" (2004) emphasizes the emptiness of globalization in the backdrop of an internationally themed amusement park.\n\nSome of the more prolific Sixth Generation directors to have emerged are Wang Xiaoshuai (\"The Days\", \"Beijing Bicycle\"), Zhang Yuan (\"Beijing Bastards\", \"East Palace West Palace\"), Jia Zhangke (\"Xiao Wu\", \"Unknown Pleasures\", \"Platform\", \"The World\"), He Jianjun (\"Postman\") and Lou Ye (\"Suzhou River\", \"Summer Palace\"). One young director who does not share most of the concerns of the Sixth Generation is Lu Chuan (\"\", 2004; \"City of Life and Death\", 2010).\n\nThere is a growing number of independent post-Sixth Generation filmmakers making films with extremely low budgets and using digital equipment. They are the so-called dGeneration (for digital). These films, like those from Sixth Generation filmmakers, are mostly made outside the Chinese film system and are shown mostly on the international film festival circuit. Ying Liang and Jian Yi are two of these dGeneration filmmakers. Ying's \"Taking Father Home\" (2005) and \"The Other Half\" (2006) are both representative of the dGeneration trends of feature film. Liu Jiayin made two dGeneration feature films, \"Oxhide\" (2004) and \"Oxhide II\" (2010), blurring the line between documentary and narrative film. \"Oxhide\", made by Liu when she was a film student, frames herself and her parents in their claustrophobic Beijing apartment in a narrative praised by critics.\n\nTwo decades of reform and commercialization have brought dramatic social changes in mainland China, reflected not only in fiction film but in a growing documentary movement. Wu Wenguang's 70-minute \"\" (1990) is now seen as one of the first works of this \"New Documentary Movement\" (NDM) in China. \"Bumming\", made between 1988 and 1990, contains interviews with five young artists eking out a living in Beijing, subject to state authorized tasks. Shot using a camcorder, the documentary ends with four of the artists moving abroad after the 1989 Tiananmen Protests. \"Dance with the Farm Workers\" (2001) is another documentary by Wu.\n\nAnother internationally acclaimed documentary is Wang Bing's nine-hour tale of deindustrialization \"\" (2003). Wang's subsequent documentaries, \"\" (2007), \"Crude Oil\" (2008), \"Man with no name\" (2009), \"Three Sisters\" (2012) and \"Feng ai\" (2013), cemented his reputation as a leading documentarist of the movement.\n\nLi Hong, the first woman in the NDM, in \"Out of Phoenix Bridge\" (1997) relates the story of four young women, who moving from rural areas to the big cities like millions of other men and women, have come to Beijing to make a living.\n\nThe New Documentary Movement in recent times has overlapped with the dGeneration filmmaking, with most documentaries being shot cheaply and independently in the digital format. Xu Xin's \"Karamay\" (2010), Zhao Liang's Behemoth, Huang Weikai's \"Disorder\" (2009), Zhao Dayong's \"Ghost Town\" (2009), Du Haibing's \"1428\" (2009), Xu Tong's \"Fortune Teller\" (2010) and Li Ning’s \"Tape\" (2010) were all shot in digital format. All had made their impact in the international documentary scene and the use of digital format allows for works of vaster lengths.\n\nWith China's liberalization in the late 1970s and its opening up to foreign markets, commercial considerations have made its impact in post-1980s filmmaking. Traditionally arthouse movies screened seldom make enough to break even. An example is Fifth Generation director Tian Zhuangzhuang's \"The Horse Thief\" (1986), a narrative film with minimal dialog on a Tibetan horse thief. The film, showcasing exotic landscapes, was well received by Chinese and some Western arthouse audiences, but did poorly at the box office.\nTian's later \"The Warrior and the Wolf\" (2010) was a similar commercial failure. Prior to these, there were examples of successful commercial films in the post-liberalization period. One was the romance film \"Romance on the Lu Mountain\" (1980), which was a success with older Chinese. The film broke the Guinness Book of Records as the longest-running film on a first run. Jet Li's cinematic debut \"Shaolin Temple\" (1982) was an instant hit at home and abroad (in Japan and the Southeast Asia, for example). Another successful commercial film was \"Murder in 405\" (405谋杀案, 1980), a murder thriller.\n\nFeng Xiaogang's \"The Dream Factory\" (1997) was heralded as a turning point in Chinese movie industry, a \"hesui pian\" (Chinese New Year-screened film) which demonstrated the viability of the commercial model in China's socialist market society. Feng has become the most successful commercial director in the post-1997 era. Almost all his films made high returns domestically while he used ethnic Chinese co-stars like Rosamund Kwan, Jacqueline Wu, Rene Liu and Shu Qi to boost his films' appeal.\n\nIn the decade following 2010, owing to the influx of Hollywood films (though the number screened each year is curtailed), Chinese domestic cinema faces mounting challenges. The industry is growing and domestic films are starting to achieve the box office impact of major Hollywood blockbusters. However, not all domestic films are successful financially. In January 2010 James Cameron's \"Avatar\" was pulled out from non-3D theaters for Hu Mei's biopic \"Confucius\", but this move led to a backlash on Hu's film. Zhang Yang's 2005 \"Sunflower\" also made little money, but his earlier, low-budget \"Spicy Love Soup\" (1997) grossed ten times its budget of ¥3 million. Likewise, the 2006 \"Crazy Stone\", a sleeper hit, was made for just 3 million HKD/US$400,000. In 2009–11, Feng's \"Aftershock\" (2009) and Jiang Wen's \"Let the Bullets Fly\" (2010) became China's highest grossing domestic films, with \"Aftershock\" earning ¥670 million (US$105 million) and \"Let the Bullets Fly\" ¥674 million (US$110 million). \"Lost in Thailand\" (2012) became the first Chinese film to reach ¥1 billion at the Chinese box office and \"Monster Hunt\" (2015) became the first to reach . As of November 2015, 5 of the top 10 highest-grossing films in China are domestic productions. On February 8, 2016, the Chinese box office set a new single-day gross record, with , beating the previous record of on July 18, 2015. Also on February 2016, \"The Mermaid\", directed by Stephen Chow, became the highest-grossing film in China, overtaking \"Monster Hunt\". It is also the first film to reach .\n\nHe Ping is a director of mostly Western-like films set in Chinese locale. His \"Swordsmen in Double Flag Town\" (1991) and \"Sun Valley\" (1995) explore narratives set in the sparse terrain of West China near the Gobi Desert. His historical drama \"Red Firecracker, Green Firecracker\" (1994) won a myriad of prizes home and abroad.\n\nRecent cinema has seen Chinese cinematographers direct some acclaimed films. Other than Zhang Yimou, Lü Yue made \"Mr. Zhao\" (1998), a black comedy film well received abroad. Gu Changwei's minimalist epic \"Peacock\" (2005), about a quiet, ordinary Chinese family with three very different siblings in the post-Cultural Revolution era, took home the Silver Bear prize for 2005 Berlin International Film Festival. Hou Yong is another cinematographer who made films (\"Jasmine Women\", 2004) and TV series. There are actors who straddle the dual roles of acting and directing. Xu Jinglei, a popular Chinese actress, has made six movies to date. Her second film \"Letter from an Unknown Woman\" (2004) landed her the San Sebastián International Film Festival Best Director award. Another popular actress and director is Zhao Wei, whose directorial debut \"So Young\" (2013) was a huge box office and critical success.\n\nThe most highly regarded Chinese actor-director is undoubtedly Jiang Wen, who has directed several critically acclaimed movies while following on his acting career. His directorial debut, \"In the Heat of the Sun\" (1994) was the first PRC film to win Best Picture at the Golden Horse Film Awards held in Taiwan. His other films, like \"Devils on the Doorstep\" (2000, Cannes Grand Prix) and \"Let the Bullets Fly\" (2010), were similarly well received. By the early 2011, \"Let the Bullets Fly\" had become the highest grossing domestic film in China's history.\n\nSince the late 1980s and progressively in the 2000s, Chinese films have enjoyed considerable box office success abroad. Formerly viewed only by cineastes, its global appeal mounted after the international box office and critical success of Ang Lee's period martial arts film \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" which won Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2000. This multi-national production increased its appeal by featuring stars from all parts of the Chinese-speaking world. It provided an introduction to Chinese cinema (and especially the wuxia genre) for many and increased the popularity of many earlier Chinese films. To date \"Crouching Tiger\" remains the most commercially successful foreign-language film in U.S. history.\n\nSimilarly, in 2002, Zhang Yimou's \"Hero\" was another international box office success. Its cast featured famous actors from the Mainland China and Hong Kong who were also known to some extent in the West, including Jet Li, Zhang Ziyi, Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung Chiu-Wai. Despite criticisms by some that these two films pander somewhat to Western tastes, \"Hero\" was a phenomenal success in most of Asia and topped the U.S. box office for two weeks, making enough in the U.S. alone to cover the production costs.\n\nOther films such as \"Farewell My Concubine\", \"2046\", \"Suzhou River\", \"The Road Home\" and \"House of Flying Daggers\" were critically acclaimed around the world. The Hengdian World Studios can be seen as the \"Chinese Hollywood\", with a total area of up to 330 ha. and 13 shooting bases, including a 1:1 copy of the Forbidden City.\n\nThe successes of \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" and \"Hero\" make it difficult to demarcate the boundary between \"Mainland Chinese\" cinema and a more international-based \"Chinese-language cinema\". \"Crouching Tiger\", for example, was directed by a Taiwan-born American director (Ang Lee) who works often in Hollywood. Its pan-Chinese leads include Mainland Chinese (Zhang Ziyi), Hong Kong (Chow Yun-Fat), Taiwan (Chang Chen) and Malaysian (Michelle Yeoh) actors and actresses; the film was co-produced by an array of Chinese, American, Hong Kong, and Taiwan film companies. Likewise, Lee's Chinese-language \"Lust, Caution\" (2007) drew a crew and cast from Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and includes an orchestral score by French composer Alexandre Desplat. This merging of people, resources and expertise from the three regions and the broader East Asia and the world, marks the movement of Chinese-language cinema into a domain of large scale international influence. Other examples of films in this mold include \"The Promise\" (2005), \"The Banquet\" (2006), \"Fearless\" (2006), \"The Warlords\" (2007), \"Bodyguards and Assassins\" (2009) and \"Red Cliff\" (2008-9). The ease with which ethnic Chinese actresses and actors straddle the mainland and Hong Kong has significantly increased the number of co-productions in Chinese-language cinema. Many of these films also feature South Korean or Japanese actors to appeal to their East Asian neighbours. Some artistes originating from the mainland, like Hu Jun, Zhang Ziyi, Tang Wei and Zhou Xun, obtained Hong Kong residency under the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme and have acted in many Hong Kong productions.\n\nIn 2010, Chinese cinema was the third largest film industry by number of feature films produced annually. In 2013, China's gross box office was ¥21.8 billion (US$3.6 billion), the second-largest film market in the world by box office receipts. In January 2013, \"Lost in Thailand\" (2012) became the first Chinese film to reach ¥1 billion at the box office. As of May 2013, 7 of the top 10 highest-grossing films in China were domestic productions. As of 2014, around half of all tickets are sold online, with the largest ticket selling sites being Maoyan.com (82 million), Gewara.com (45 million) and Wepiao.com (28 million). In 2014, Chinese films earned ¥1.87 billion outside China. By December 2013 there were 17,000 screens in the country. By January 6, 2014, there were 18,195 screens in the country. Greater China has around 251 IMAX theaters. There were 299 cinema chains (252 rural, 47 urban), 5,813 movie theaters and 24,317 screens in the country in 2014.\n\nThe country added about 8,035 screens in 2015 (at an average of 22 new screens per day, increasing its total by about 40% to around 31,627 screens, which is about 7,373 shy of the number of screens in the United States. Chinese films accounted for 61.48% of ticket sales in 2015 (up from 54% last year) with more than 60% of ticket sales being made online. Average ticket price was down about 2.5% to $5.36 in 2015. It also witnessed 51.08% increase in admissions, with 1.26 billion people buying tickets to the cinema in 2015. Chinese films grossed overseas in 2015. During the week of the 2016 Chinese New Year, the country set a new record for the highest box office gross during one week in one territory with , overtaking the previous record of of December 26, 2015 to January 1, 2016 in the United States and Canada. Chinese films grossed () in foreign markets in 2016.\n\nAs of April 2015, the largest Chinese film company by worth was Alibaba Pictures (US$8.77 billion). Other large companies include Huayi Brothers Media (US$7.9 billion), Enlight Media (US$5.98 billion) and Bona Film Group (US$542 million). The biggest distributors by market share in 2014 were: China Film Group (32.8%), Huaxia Film (22.89%), Enlight Pictures (7.75%), Bona Film Group (5.99%), Wanda Media (5.2%), Le Vision Pictures (4.1%), Huayi Brothers (2.26%), United Exhibitor Partners (2%), Heng Ye Film Distribution (1.77%) and Beijing Anshi Yingna Entertainment (1.52%). The biggest cinema chains in 2014 by box office gross were: Wanda Cinema Line (), China Film Stellar (393.35 million), Dadi Theater Circuit (378.17 million), Shanghai United Circuit (355.07 million), Guangzhou Jinyi Zhujiang (335.39 million), China Film South Cinema Circuit (318.71 million), Zhejiang Time Cinema (190.53 million), China Film Group Digital Cinema Line (177.42 million), Hengdian Cinema Line (170.15 million) and Beijing New Film Association (163.09 million).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Benjamin and his brothers had emigrated from Germany and opened a dry-goods store in Indiana.\n\nAfter graduating from The Baltimore Women's College, now known as Goucher College, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1907, Clara moved to New York City and went into journalism, writing for various popular magazines and devoting time to study the stage. She married Albert Berwanger with whom she had a daughter, Frances Berwanger in 1909. When she began to write, Frances would change her name to Beranger.\n\nUsing the pseudonym of Charles S. Beranger, her first screen employment was as a freelancer, writing for the Edison, Vitagraph and Kalem companies, to whom she furnished many originals as well as continuities. Her success attracted some attention and she was appointed as a staff writer for the Fox Corporation. She wrote several scripts for the popular child star Baby Marie Osborne as well as a much-praised adaptation of \"A Tale of Two Cities\". Beranger also wrote \"The Interloper\" for Kitty Gordon, \"The Bluffer\" for June Elvidge and \"The Mirror\" for Marjorie Rambeau, though many of these films are considered lost. With Forrest Halsey, Beranger wrote the stage play, \"His Chinese Wife\", which received good reviews and became one of the successes of the 1919–1920 season.\n\nIn 1921, Clara took Frances, then twelve, and migrated to Hollywood to write for motion pictures, where she signed a long contract with Cecil B. DeMille's Famous Players-Lasky; the outfit with whom she is most associated. She wrote or contributed to more than 24 DeMille productions, and produced both \"Come Out of the Kitchen\" and \"Girls\" for Marguerite Clark; \"Sadie Love\" and \"\" for Billie Burke; \"Judy of Rogue's Harbor\" for Mary Miles Minter; \"The Fear Market\" for Alice Brady; \"The Cost\" for Violet Heming; \"Half an Hour\" for Dorothy Dalton; \"Civilian Clothes\" for Thomas Meighan, \"Notoriety\" for Bebe Daniels, and the classic \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" for John Barrymore.\n\nFrom an interview with Louella Parson in 1922:\n\nI will be out in California when Mr. DeMille begins operations. Under my old contract I furnished eight continuities a year; now that I work only for William DeMille I only write four. That gives me an opportunity to see my work through from the story to the screen. It makes it possible for me to go over my script scene by scene with the producer, so he can make the picture with almost no changes. In the old days I had to keep my nose to the grindstone continually so as to finish the eight pictures in time for the different directors for whom I was writing.\n\nIn 1921 Beranger met her future husband William DeMille and work on the adaptation of \"Miss Lulu Bett\", the Pulitzer Prize-winning play about a young woman who discovers that she’s married to a man who is already married. Not as famous today as Cecil, and though most of his silents have been lost, William is still considered one of the silents' most respected directors. \"Miss Lulu Bett\" shows a delicate touch in the telling of an impoverished spinster's misfortunes in a small town.\n\nWilliam had other affairs including Lorna Moon who had borne him a son out of wedlock, and with another screenwriter, Olga Printzlau; but he genuinely fell in love with Clara who had tolerated it all. In June 1926, William to the surprise of his wife, announced that he wanted a divorce. Anna refused him and took their daughters, Agnes and Margaret, to Europe for a long trip. When the family returned, William announced that he had given up Beranger and would try again with his wife, but this arrangement only lasted about a year. Anna never recovered from the divorce, and took the children to live in New York permanently. William DeMille (50) and Clara Beranger (42) would be married in Albuquerque, New Mexico on August 14, 1928 in the drawing room aboard \"The Chief\", a transcontinental special train. William de Mille states that Beranger wrote all of his screen plays from 1921 - 1928. He writes in his book, \"Hollywood Saga\" ; \"In April, 1928, I had just finished ‘Tenth Avenue,’ my forty - fifth product ion and was working on ‘Craig’s Wife’ with Clara Beranger , who had written the screen plays of all my pictures for seven years and continued to do so even after our marriage.\" .\n\nAfter marrying into the DeMille dynasty, Beranger would continue to write, including \"Craig's Wife\" (1928) for Irene Rich and \"This Mad World\" (1930) for Kay Johnson. William would lose everything in the Depression and unhappily rely on Beranger to support him, until Beranger asked Cecil DeMille to employ him to write scenarios.\n\nBaranger would retire from writing pictures in 1934, though she remained a frequent contributor to magazines such as Liberty and Good Housekeeping, and writer of inspirational books. Beranger's largest impact would be as one of the original faculty of USC School of Cinematic Arts which had begun in 1929 as a collaboration between the University of Southern California and Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Also among the original faculty were actors Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, directors D.W. Griffith and Ernst Lubitsch, and producers Irving Thalberg and Darryl Zanuck. Cecil would endow the Drama Department, to which William would be appointed as Director, at last allowing him to exploit his education and skills as a teacher and director.\n\nBeranger was a large proponent of the idea that Hollywood had a responsibility to teach the next generation of artists, and would write a much-used text \"Writing for the Screen\" in 1950 and continue to lecture on screenwriting for the rest of her life. She suffered a heart attack and died in 1956.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25099429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25099429", "title": "Counter-Maniera", "text": "Counter-Maniera\n\nCounter-\"Maniera\" or Counter-Mannerism (variously capitalized and part-italicized) is a term in art history for a trend identified by some art historians in 16th-century Italian painting that forms a sub-category or phase of Mannerism, the dominant movement in Italian art between about 1530 and 1590. Counter-\"Maniera\" or Counter-Mannerism reacted against the artificiality of the second generation of Mannerist painters in the second half of the 16th century. It was in part due to artists wishing to follow the vague prescriptions for clarity and simplicity in art issued by the Council of Trent in its final session in 1563, and represented a rejection of the distortions and artificiality of high Mannerist style, and a partial return to the classicism and balance of High Renaissance art, with \"clarity in formal order and legibility in content\". \n\nThe term was devised by the art historian Sydney Joseph Freedberg (1914–1997), and has gained a good degree of acceptance, although it is by no means universally adopted by other art historians. Counter-Maniera was one of the four phases of 16th-century Italian painting defined by Freedberg in his \"Painting in Italy, 1500–1600\", first published in 1971 and long the standard textbook on the period, as: \"First \"Maniera\", High \"Maniera\", Counter-\"Maniera\" and Late \"Maniera\"\". The styles did not neatly succeed each other but existed side by side for much of the time, with High \"Maniera\" remaining the dominant style during the main period of Counter-\"Maniera\" in the third quarter of the 16th century. In many cases Counter-Mannerism was a development of an artist's style in mid or late career, or a style used for some works, especially religious commissions, while other works by the same artist continued to use a high \"maniera\" style. \n\nFreedberg's contemporary Federico Zeri had in 1957 introduced or revived his own term \"arte sacra\" (\"sacred art\") for pre-Baroque Counter-Reformation style in Roman painting, overlapping to a large degree with Freedberg's Counter-Maniera, though rather wider in both the dates and styles included. The use of the term Counter-\"Maniera\" may be in decline, as impatience with such \"style labels\" grows among art historians. In 2000 Marcia B. Hall, a leading art historian of the period and mentee of Freedberg, was criticised by a reviewer of her \"After Raphael: Painting in Central Italy in the Sixteenth Century\" for her \"fundamental flaw\" in continuing to use this and other terms, despite an apologetic \"Note on style labels\" at the beginning of the book and a promise to keep their use to a minimum.\n\nThe definition of Mannerism itself is notoriously complex, and that of Counter-Mannerism, which to a considerable extent is defined negatively or reductively against it, is no less so. Many parts of Italy, led by Venice and other northern centres, were on the periphery of both the High Renaissance and the Mannerist reaction, and reached what might be called a Counter-Mannerist style merely by continuing to develop regional Renaissance styles, and accepting moderate doses of \"maniera\" influence. The term is most often applied to painters in Florence and Rome who reacted against the prevailing style in these centres of full-blooded \"maniera\", without a fundamental rejection of its underlying principles. In proposing the term Freedberg compares it with terms such as \"counterpart\" and \"counterpoint\", explaining that he intends \"implying parallelism and relation between two terms at the same time as their opposition\". \n\nCharacteristics of the \"maniera\" often retained in counter-\"maniera\" works, though in moderation, are an idealized and abstracted treatment of the content, absence of naturalism, an avoidance of the expression of emotion, and many of the formal characteristics noted by Friedländer, such as the arrangement of figures on the same plane at the front of the picture space, which they nearly fill. Elements of the \"maniera\" that are removed include the impulse to push to the extreme, the willingness to sacrifice everything for a graceful effect, playfulness and wit, and the readiness to let the details and ambience of a painting crowd out or submerge the supposed main figures, that must be hunted out by the learned viewer. The style restores a decorum suitable for religious works, and removes distractions from the central religious figures. In its latest phase, from about 1585, the need for popular appeal appears to have been recognized by artists and commissioners in the church, leading to some relaxation of the austerity of earlier periods, and sometimes to sentimentality. \n\nThe term counter-\"maniera\" is not usually applied to the more radical Bolognese reaction of the Carraccis from the 1580s, although this represented a more effective rejection of Mannerist artificiality. For Freedberg this was \"a new and un-Maniera attitude to art\"; elsewhere he cautions against confusing Counter-\"Maniera\" with \"anti-Maniera\", apparently reflecting \"Anti-Mannerism\", the term used by Walter Friedländer for the \"palpable break in the stylistic development of Italian painting\" that occurred \"sometime around 1590\". The use of the term has not been extended to Northern Mannerism.\n\nDeciding what characterizes a work in Counter-Mannerist style may not be straightforward; in the single brief passage mentioning the term in John Shearman's \"Mannerism\" (1967), he picks Santi di Tito's \"Vision of St Thomas Aquinas\" (1593, illustrated here, as in both books) as an example of it, but Freedberg excludes Santo's classicising naturalism from the style, though noting his similarities to it. Shearman's other main example of Counter-Mannerism is Federigo Barocci, who Freedberg also excludes from his definition.\n\nMany painters looked to revive the styles of Raphael, Andrea del Sarto and other High Renaissance masters, or drew inspiration from the Venetian masters of the High Renaissance. The example of Michelangelo's late work was important for many artists. The Florentine biographer and critic Raffaello Borghini, author of \"Il Riposo della Pitura e della Scultura\" published in 1584, has been proposed as a theorist, rather late into the course of the trend, but his work is little known. The artists of Counter-Mannerism remain relatively unknown, and often hard to see outside Italy, as much of their work was religious and remains in the churches for which it was commissioned, or Italian museums. It was mostly ignored in the hunt by picture dealers in the 18th and 19th centuries. Freedberg says frankly: \"Boredom is a requisite of the Roman Counter-Maniera style, invading even the art of the few painters whose inspiration may be too considerable and too authentic to be sealed off wholly\".\n\nFreedberg cautions against treating the style as simply a reflection of the decrees of Trent, which were a last minute and little-discussed addition, based on a French draft, to the final session in 1563, well after the style had begun to show itself. He describes the decrees as \"a codifying and official sanction of a temper that had come to be conspicuous in Roman culture\".\n\nIt should also be noted that Freedberg, like the majority of art historians dealing with the period—even today—tended to view mid-to-late sixteenth-century and early seventeenth-century Italian art history through the singular pro-Roman Bolognese lens of Gian Pietro Bellori's \"Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects\" - meaning Freedburg may have had little time for any alternative historical narrative that did not support a \"pro-Bolognese\" artistic account of Counter-\"Maniera\" reform.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3573342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3573342", "title": "Craigmillar Festival Society", "text": "Craigmillar Festival Society\n\nThe Craigmillar Festival Society (CFS) was a Community Arts organisation that existed in the Craigmillar area of Edinburgh, Scotland from 1962 to 2002. It is regarded as important contributor to the Community Arts Movement. Starting in 1967, many of its productions involved Craigmillar Castle.\n\nThe Craigmillar Festival Committee was established in 1962, when a mothers group at Peffermill Primary School, south-east side of Edinburgh, created a Festival to celebrate local talent with the aid of then local councillor Jack Kane.\n\nBy 1962, Craigmillar was suffering from all the social ills of 20th century urban living and decay. The crunch came when the school’s reply to a request for music lessons for her son from local mother Helen Crummy was … \"it takes us all our time to teach these children the 3Rs far less music.\" Biting their tongues the frustrated mothers in Peffermill School Mothers Club responded by knocking on doors, pulling out local talent and staging a People’s Festival of music, drama, and the arts. The Festival was an instant success which brought joy, colour and fun to a drab and grey environment.\n\nThe festival married fun with passion for intensive political action. This led to politicians working not just for, but WITH, the local people. Combining culture with satirical criticism, the people wrote and produced their own community musicals and historical productions, basing them on the area’s multitude of social concerns and issues.\n\nIn 1970 the Craigmillar Festival Committee gained official recognition, charitable status and changed its name to the Craigmillar Festival Society (CFS). By 1976 the Society was employing 600 people and involving 1500 volunteers. That year, 17000 people either took part or attended the annual festival. By this time, it had received a major anti-poverty research grant from The European Community.\n\nA prime example of what the CFS did in the community was through the tireless work of the Bingham neighbourhood worker Claire Elder. In 1970, she persuaded some neighbours to go dressed as a gypsy tribe to the Mediaeval Fayre. Later calling themselves the Bingham Belles, they formed a drama and music group and became stars of the Festival's Old Tyme Musical Hall. Entertaining in and beyond Craigmillar, they successfully campaigned to obtain much needed amenities for Bingham, including their own community centre and youth facilities.\n\nSeveral CFS workers AND volunteers who came from AND lived in the community went on to become teachers and trainers of the CFS ethic in their later lives with other organisations and even government quangoes. But they were first and foremost at the heart of the CFS activities in the community.\n\nThe CFS created and developed many concepts including Communiversity, Arts As The Catalyst, Creative Shared Government, Neighbourhood Workers Scheme and the hugely influential planning document \"The Comprehensive Plan for Action\" where Art and culture were the catalyst in all aspects of regeneration.\n\nOne of the CFS founders, Helen Crummy created an MBE in 1973 (later awarded an honorary doctorate), produced a book called \"Let The People Sing\" that provides an account of the background and development of the CFS.\n\nMany artists, politicians and researchers came to Craigmillar, either to see or become involved in the community activities. Each of these have taken the seed and rooted it worldwide, from The Easterhouse Festival Society, Notting Hill Carnival and also in the work of Neil Cameron and Reg Bolton in Australia. Craigmillar Festival Society helped create many things, amongst them; The Mermaid Sculpture by Pedro Silva; The Gentle Giant Sculpture by Jimmy Boyle; The Bill Douglas Trilogy, in particular \"My Childhood\" (funded by British Film Institute).\n\nThe Craigmillar Festival Society was the recognised leader in the production of The Community Musical theatre productions, where professional actors worked very closely with local people. In effect, since 1962, local people came together and produced well over 100 productions. From 1973's first Community Musical \"The Time Machine\", 1974's \"Castle, Cooncil & Curse, 1975's \"Time and Motion Man\", 1976's \"Willie Wynn\", 1977's Culture Vultures\" and 1978's \"Oh Gentle Giant\", to the 1980s with \"Shoo\", \"For A' That & A' That\", \"Dampbusters\" and \"Watch It\", the 1990s and \"Fit For Heroes\", \"Kicking Up A Stink\" and \"In Your Dreams\" and the more recent \"Grease Niddrie Style\". All included songs such as \"Craigmillar Now\", \"When People Play Their Part\", \"Arled Bairn\", \"Candy Barrie\" and \"He Promised Me\".\n\nMany local people who began performing in Community productions went on to become successful professional performers, Alice Henderson and Johnni Stanton, who went on to form their own companies, but most notably, Faye Milligan (The Steamie), and James (Micky) MacPherson, whose company Plum Films won a BAFTA award. Both returned to Craigmillar and directed local productions.\n\nCraigmillar was at the forefront of the Golden Age of artistic expansion in Edinburgh in the early 70s and helped to create several lasting institutions, among them, Theatre Workshop Edinburgh.\n\nIt also has links with Professor Eric Trist and The Tavistock Institute, Billy Connolly, Richard Demarco, Anne Lorne Gillies, Joan Bakewell, Michael Marra and Bill Paterson.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Society’s work began to be noticed from both near and far with distinguished commentators making reference to it.\n\n\nIt has also been compared to The Peckham Experiment and Bromley by Bow Centre and The Healthy Living Centre concept. In recent years The Bromley by Bow Centre has taken up The Communiversity concept to develop its education programme.\n\nBy 2002 after a public investigation into alleged improper use of funding, funding was cut off and the remaining CFS projects were made independent organizations. Although the original CFS organization is now defunct, its spirit lives on within the community and it continues to attract attention through the \"Arts As A Catalyst\" Exhibition at The City Arts Centre, Edinburgh in 2004 and an award-winning documentary, which won The Saltire Award at The Edinburgh International Film Festival in 2005.\nThe local arts scene is also kept alive by two community organisations currently existing within the community, Craigmillar Community Arts, who provide a variety of arts based projects at Craigmillar Arts Centre on Newcraighall Road and the Greater Craigmillar Archives who are devoted to recording and preserving a physical and digital record of the Craigmillar community through the years.\n\n\n"}

In 1993, closed this branch of activities, leaving a large building in a state of abandonment. \n\nA few years after, a group of artists, intrigued by this big empty space, decided to turn a room into a rehearsal place. Step-by-step, other artists wished to enjoy different spaces to create, to rehearse. The new owner of the building gave its agreement for necessary rearrangements and renovations.\n\nNowadays, the factory disposes of of space, dedicated to creation and diffusion. The building aesthetics of Polymer are typical Soviet industrial style. Concrete production facilities were transferred over time to incorporate new space for living, artistic use and events, with the old flair and keeping its authenticity. The conservation of the old factory's name, \"Polymer\", perpetuates the memory of this historic past.\n\nPolymer, it is nowadays:\n\nA traditional letterpress print shop was also installed in the building; it's kept alive through realisation of posters for different organizations and animation of workshops for different publics.\n\nGradually, Polymer became a place for residencies and diffusion with multiple spaces, where live together about 30 artists and organizations, working on diverse artistic fields. \nConstituted as a non profit organization, Polymer works as a platform, as a venue for different events and activities, offering thus a new space for alternative culture in Tallinn. Public events take place every week, involving artist in residency and guest artist also, from Tallinn, Estonia and Europe.\n\nEvery year in August, Polymer organizes its own festival, \"Culture Factory Festival\"; during 2 weeks, artists of the house open their studios and hang their art out to take some fresh air, and artists and a multitude of events from diverse universes take possession of the place: exhibition openings, concerts, film screenings, dance performances. Important is involving the audience in action through the workshops during the festival.\n\nPolymer is an organization involved in local life and open to outwards contacts.

It is one of a large group of similar rhymes in which the child who is pointed to by the chanter on the last syllable is either \"chosen\" or \"counted out\". The rhyme has existed in various forms since well before 1820. and is common in many languages with similar-sounding nonsense syllables.\n\nSince many similar counting rhymes existed earlier, it is difficult to ascertain this rhyme's exact original.\n\nA common modern version is:\n\nThere are many common variations, such as replacing tiger with \"piggy\", \"tinker\", \"tigger\", a two-syllable name, etc.; and changing the verb in the third line to \"screams\", \"wiggles\", \"squeals\" or another verb.\n\nSometimes additional lines are added at the end of the rhyme to draw out or manipulate the selection process or make it seem less predetermined, such as:\n\nOr alternatively:\n\nOccasionally the line copies 'Ip dip':\n\nThe first record of a similar rhyme, called the \"Hana, man,\" is from about 1815, when children in New York City are said to have repeated the rhyme:\n\nHenry Carrington Bolton discovered this version to be in the US, Ireland and Scotland in the 1880s but was unknown in England until later in the century. Bolton also found a similar rhyme in German:\n\nVariations of this rhyme, with the nonsense/counting first line have been collected since the 1820s, such as this Scottish one:\n\nMore recognizable as a variation, which even includes the 'toe' and 'olla' from Kipling's version, is:\nThis was one of many variants of \"counting out rhymes\" collected by Bolton in 1888.\n\nA Cornish version collected in 1882 runs:\n\nIt is worth noting that the opening to this counting rhyme, \"ena mena\", is almost identical to the Greek for \"one by one\" (\"ena m'ena\").\n\nOne theory about the origins of the rhyme is that it is descended from Old English or Welsh counting, similar to the old Shepherd's count \"Yan Tan Tethera\" or the Cornish \"Eena, mena, mona, mite\".\n\nAnother possibility is that British colonials returning from the Sub-Continent introduced a doggerel version of an Indian children's rhyme used in the game of carom billiards:\n\nThe rhyme inspired the song \"Eena Meena Deeka\" in the 1957 Bollywood film Aasha.\n\nAnother possible origin is from a Swahili poem brought to the Americas by enslaved Africans: \"Iino ya mmiini maiini mo\".\n\nMost likely the origin is a centuries-old, possibly Old Saxon diviner rhyme, as was shown in 1957 by the Dutch philologist dr. Jan Naarding, supported by prof. dr. Klaas Heeroma at the Nedersaksisch Instituut (Low Saxon Institute) at the University of Groningen. They published their findings in an article called \"Een oud wichellied en zijn verwanten\" (An old diviner rhyme and its relatives). In part I of the article Naarding explains, why the counting rhyme he found in \"Twents-Achterhoeks woordenboek\" (1948), a dictionary by G.H. Wanink, stands close to an early mediaeval or even older archetype. That same version was recorded in 1904 in Goor in Twente by Nynke van Hichtum:\n\nNaarding calls its origin 'a heathen priest song, that begs the highest goddess for an oracle while divining, an oracle that may decide about life and death of a human'. The first lines can be translated as 'foremother of mankind, give me a sign, I take the cut off pieces of a branch (= the rune wands).\"\nThis explanation was revived and extended in 2016 by Goaitsen van der Vliet, founder of the Twentse Taalbank (Twents Language Bank). The last line of the rhyme (in the Netherlands degenerated to 'iet wiet waait weg') can be translated as 'I weigh it up' (in Dutch 'ik wik en weeg').\n\nSome American versions of this rhyme use the word \"nigger\" instead of \"tiger\":\n\nThis version was similar to that reported by Henry Carrington Bolton as the most common version among American schoolchildren in 1888. It was used in the chorus of Bert Fitzgibbon's 1906 song \"Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Mo\":\n\nIt was also used by Rudyard Kipling in his \"A Counting-Out Song\", from \"Land and Sea Tales for Scouts and Guides\", published in 1935. This may have helped popularise this version in the United Kingdom where it seems to have replaced all earlier versions until the late twentieth century.\n\nIona and Peter Opie pointed out in \"The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes\" that the word \"nigger\" was common in American folk-lore, but unknown in any English traditional rhyme or proverb. This, combined with evidence of various other versions of the rhyme in the British Isles pre-dating this post-slavery version, would seem to suggest that it originated in North America, although the apparently American word \"\" was first recorded in written form in England in the fourteenth century, whereas according to the Oxford English Dictionary the words \"Niger\" or \"'nigger\" were first recorded in England in the sixteenth century with their current disparaging meaning. The 'olla' and 'toe' are found as nonsense words in some nineteenth century versions of the rhyme, and it could possibly be that the original 'Where do all the Frenchmen Go?' (probably originating during one of the periods of Anglo-French warfare) was later on replaced by the earlier version in the United States, using some of the nonsense words.\n\nThere are considerable variations in the lyrics of the rhyme, including from early twentieth century in the United States of America:\n\nDuring the Second World War, an AP dispatch from Atlanta, Georgia reported: \"Atlanta children were heard reciting this wartime rhyme: \nA distinct version of the rhyme in the United Kingdom, collected in the 1950s & 1960s, is:\n\nVersions collected in New Zealand in 2002 include:\n\nIn Latin America the children play a game to choose or discard players, or to draw a winner/loser, singing:\n\nAnother Latin American Version:\n\nIn 1935, Billie Holiday sang this Johnny Mercer, Matty Malnecka version:\n\n\nThere are many scenes in books, films, plays, cartoons and video games in which a variant of \"Eeny meeny ...\" is used by a character who is making a choice, either for serious or comic effect. Notably, the rhyme has been used by killers to choose victims in the 1994 films \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Natural Born Killers\", the 2003 film \"Elephant\", and the sixth-season finale of the AMC television series \"The Walking Dead\". In \"Let the Tiger Go\", a documentary on tiger conservation released on YouTube in 2017, the poem is read by Alan Rabinowitz in advocacy for ending the poaching of tigers for their body parts. The very title of the documentary is implied to be an allusion to the poem.\n\nOther uses of the phrase in popular culture include:\n\nThe vinyl release of Radiohead's album \"OK Computer\" (1997) uses the words \"eeny meeny miny moe\" (rather than letter or numbers) on the labels of Sides A, B, C and D respectively.\n\nEenie Meenie Records is a Los Angeles-based music record label.\n\nThe names of many songs include some or all of the phrase, including:\nThe title of Chester Himes's novel \"If He Hollers Let Him Go\" (1945) refers to the rhyme.\n\nIn Salman Rushdie's \"The Moor's Last Sigh\" (1995), the leading character and his three sisters are nicknamed Ina, Minnie, Mynah and Moor.\n\nRex Stout wrote a 1962 Nero Wolfe novella titled \"Eeny Meeny Murder Mo\".\n\nIn the 1930s, animation producer Walter Lantz introduced the cartoon characters Meany, Miny, and Moe (later Meeny, Miney and Mo). First appearing in Oswald Rabbit cartoons, then in their own series.\n\nThe 1933 Looney Tunes cartoon \"Bosko's Picture Show\" parodies MGM as \"TNT pictures\", whose logo is a roaring and burping lion with the motto \"Eenie Meanie Minie Moe\" in the place of MGM's \"Ars Gratia Artis\".\n\nThe rhyme appears towards the end of 1949 British black comedy, \"Kind Hearts and Coronets\". The use of the word \"nigger\" was censored for the American market, being replaced by \"sailor\".\n"}
{"id": "13331624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13331624", "title": "Eyelash curler", "text": "Eyelash curler\n\nAn eyelash curler is a hand-operated mechanical device for curling eyelashes for cosmetic purposes. Usually only the upper eyelashes are curled. \n\nThere were different patents of this invention between 1923 and 1940. The first known patent for the eyelash curler states that it was filed by Charles Stickel and William McDonell from Rochester, New York. However, William Joseph Beldue is recognized as one the first inventors while he was working in Kurlash Co., in Rochester, NY. William Beldue and his Kurlash Company held patents in Canada, the United States and Great Britain for the eyelash curler and improvements to it.\n\nIn the 1930s and in 1940s, at the top of the make up fashion, these curlers were very popular and not expensive. The eyelash curler was patented April 7, 1931 and the images drawn in the patent application look very much the same as the eyelash curlers seen on the market today. Originally named Rodal, the brand smartly changed the product’s name to Kurlash. \n\nEyelash curlers are usually made of metal, and often have rubber pads where the curlers make contact with the lashes. The general design of these devices remains the same from 1940s. Manufacturers include ForteBellezza, Shiseido and Shu Uemura.\n\nThe two most common types of eyelash curlers are heated curlers and traditional eyelash curlers. Heated eyelash curlers deliver a more intense curl that lasts longer. However a simpler step to add to an eye makeup routine includes a more traditional, unheated eyelash curler. An unheated curler that is curved for the natural shape of an individual's eye includes a plentiful enough pad to press against eyelashes. Before using, an unheated curler can be heated for a short time with a hair dryer, but not to the extent to burn the delicate skin above the eyes. Self-heating, battery-operated units are available.\n\nFor traditional eyelash curlers, start by holding the curler like a pair of scissors and opening it completely. Keep your eyes open and bring the tool towards your upper lashes. Place your lashes in between the top and padded base, stopping as close to the root of your eyelashes as possible without pinching skin. For the first round of curling, keep your tool upright by the roots of your lashes. Check that all of your lashes are inside the curler.\n\nTo avoid a sharp bend and to create a natural curled look, gently release the curler and move it up the lash, away from the lid, by one or two millimeters, and again clamp the lashes for five to 10 seconds. Gently release the curler and repeat the process one or two more times, moving the curler up the lashes, closer to the end of the lashes each time. Continue avoiding a sharp bend by moving the curler slightly up the lashes away from the roots for another clamp. Lastly, wiggle the curler up towards the tip of your lashes and close down softly with the same pulsating pressure to complete the curl. An easy trick is to start with the lash curler at the base of your lashes and then do a slow blink. The pressure of the blink helps curl your lashes as they move through the curler.\n\nIf you're using a clamp-style heated curler, start crimping at the base of your lashes and then slowly ease the curler toward the ends. One swoop - from the base to upwards takes around 10 to 15 seconds, gently holding in certain areas to set the curl. It is the combination of heat and holding the position that creates the style of curl. Take time to bend the lashes back and push back to create the curl you want. Move slowly and experiment with the angles at which you hold it.\n\nIn order to create the effects of a heated eyelash curler with only the accessibility of a traditional one, a user can warm it up with a hair dryer. To get the best results, it is recommended to use it directly after warming up with a hair dryer because it lasts longer. When using heated eyelash curlers, it is very important to be cautious of the temperature the curler is heated to. To avoid the risk of burning the eyelid with the hot metal curlers, many companies have introduced plastic based curlers. Some companies are looking into introducing self-heated curlers to control the temperature and completely eliminate the risk of a burn.\n\nTo begin, warm up the curler and then curl the eyelashes for 10 to 15 seconds. Continue curling them until you have the desired shape. Next, apply more coats of mascara and curl the eyelashes once more for the final look. Repeat the application of mascara and curling of the lashes until the desired length is reached. Due to varying eyelash length, some users may need to apply mascara and curl the eyelashes multiple times.\nAn eyelash curler is a good makeup kit tool because it gives the illusion of bigger and brighter eyes and helps lengthen the eyelashes. When it is applied using different tactics such going heavier on the outer corner eyelashes, it gives a different and well-defined shape to the eyes. It is easy to use without professional training and is not very expensive to purchase. Additionally, it is not a very big tool, so it can be comfortably placed in the makeup bag.\n\nA heated eyelash curler makes the curling process easier and an eyelash curl to last significantly longer. The heated element of the curler saves time and unnecessary pressure for a user, creating an easily curl without the need to hold the clamp down for long periods of time. Alongside this, the majority of heated curlers are wand-like, which means there's nothing pulling or pinching at your eyes. If a user has fragile lashes or lashes that are falling out, a heated eyelash curler will lift up eyelashes for a gentle curl without applying any force whatsoever. Heated eyelash curlers also tame and even out eyelashes that stick out in different directions, creating a flawless look for a user. \nAmong many advantages, there are some disadvantages to the eyelash curler. If not used with care, pulling on the eyelashes while curling can lead to weakening of the roots. Many people can damage their eyelashes by holding down the clamp on their lashes for increased lengths of time, leading to their lashes either being pulled out or falling out due to the stress of continuous clamping. This may result in the eyelashes becoming weak and eventually lead to shedding which can be very bad for an eye because they protect the eye from wind and dust and don’t grow back quickly.If not used carefully, eyelash curlers can lead to accidents where a user pinches the eyelid. Depending on the amount of pressure they apply, this can cause a serious injury to the eye. Similarly, when used warm, an eyelash curler, especially those made of metal, can cause serious burns to the eyelid. Also, some heated eyelash curlers require batteries to run, which will require maintenance to run in terms of replacement on time for smooth functioning.\n\n"}

Osmond Carr, was an English composer who wrote the music for several Victorian burlesques before turning to the new genere of Edwardian musical comedy, and also composing some comic operas. He often worked with the lyricist Adrian Ross, and several of his pieces were created for the producer George Edwardes.\n\nCarr was born in Bradford, Yorkshire, England. His parents were George Saxton Carr, a schoolmaster and Margaret Durden Carr, née Painter. He attended New College, Oxford, and Downing College, Cambridge, receiving a B.A. degree in 1883 and apparently returning to Oxford to receive a music degree there in 1884. He continued his studies at Trinity College, Cambridge, earning a Cambridge M.A. and B.Mus. in 1886 and gained a doctorate in music at Oxford in 1891.\nCarr's first produced work (with lyricist Adrian Ross) was the burlesque \"Faddimir, or the Triumph of Orthodoxy\" at the Vaudeville Theatre in London in 1889, which gained the attention of producer George Edwardes. Edwardes began to commission songs from Carr and Ross, including a song for his next Gaiety Theatre burlesque \"Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué\". They next wrote the score for a burlesque of \"Joan of Arc, or, The merry maid of Orleans\" (1891), and then the songs for what many historians consider the first British musical comedy, \"In Town\" (1892). Carr also composed another burlesque that year, \"Blue Eyed Susan\", for the Prince of Wales Theatre. Carr next composed two successful musicals for producer Fred Harris: \"Morocco Bound\" (1893), a model for the music-hall-influenced \"variety musicals\" to come, and \"Go-Bang\" (1894), both with lyrics by Ross.\n\n1n 1894, Edwardes engaged Carr to write the music for \"His Excellency\", a comic opera with a libretto by W. S. Gilbert. This was a moderate success and enjoyed international productions. Carr's musicals in the late 1890s, included \"Billy\" (1895), \"My Girl\" (1896 with Ross), \"Biarritz\" (1896 with Ross and Jerome K Jerome), a vehicle for Little Tich called \"Lord Tom Noddy\" (1896, with George Dance), \"Thrillby\" (1897) and \"The Maid of Athens\" (1897, produced by Carr). All were unsuccessful, although a number of individual songs from these musicals became popular, and some toured the British provinces.\n\nCarr's post-1900 pieces included \"The Southern Belle\" (1901), \"The Rose of the Riviera\" (1903), \"Miss Mischief\" (1904) and \"The Scottish Bluebells\" (1906), all of which had at least a provincial success, but he never regained his early popularity. Carr also wrote many separate songs and some instrumental pieces. He also produced the score for a ballet produced at the Empire Theatre in 1907 called \"Sir Roger de Coverley\".\n\nHe retired to the country in 1916 but almost immediately died of a heart attack in Uxbridge, Middlesex, England, at the age of 58.\n\n\n"}

FriendsWithYou’s mission coincides with their motto \"Magic, Luck, and Friendship.\"\n\nThe collaborative began by creating soft sculptures as a means to spread more accessible art like plush and wood toys, as well as immersive art installations, fine art works including sculpture and painting, and are best known for their public art spectacles such as large-scale art installations, playgrounds, and performance pieces. They have described the creation of their art as a healing process intended to increase relatability and connection to each other and the world around them. To date, they have become internationally recognized with public exhibits and artworks in Europe, Asia, Australia, and The Americas.\n\nFriendsWithYou Fine Art has been exhibited and/or included in the permanent collections of Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA), the Indianapolis Museum of Art (IMA), Haus der Kulturen der Welt Museum Berlin, and Galerie Emmanuel Perrotin among others.\nIn October 2006, the German art press Die Gestalten Verlag published a FriendsWithYou monograph titled \"Friends With You Have Powers!\"\n\nFriendsWithYou have explained that their art is meant to \"activate the social interaction of people as exploded and refracted by the Internet and elaborate new modes of interpersonal relationships.\"\nThey use play as an artistic means to foster these relationships. Many FriendsWithYou works look like toys because they are meant for play as a means of interactive unstructured free association. FWY hopes that \"through their artwork, the buried, neglected urges and yearnings that a seasoned art viewer may not expect to have activated; playfulness, laughter and inquisitiveness are triggered, with an end result of feeling connected.\"\n\nFWY inverts the practice and usage of religious traditions, symbols, and spiritual practices through play to open a connection to the divine.\n\nConceptually, FriendsWithYou’s experiential artwork is in conversation with Relational Aesthetics and the work of Jeff Koons, Takashi Murakami, and Damien Hirst. The collective has been compared to Takashi Murakami for their \"superflat\" approach to art.\n\nInner Vision in Between was featured at the MCLEMOI Gallery in Sydney, Australia from February 15 to April 11, 2013. The exhibition themes ran from the playful to the spiritual. It was also described as a minimal, peaceful, stoic and occasionally foreboding journey from one chapter to another.\n\nIn The Beginning, featured at the Colette in Paris from August 29 to September 24, 2011. It consisted of bronze sculptures, a series of prints, including two exclusive edition prints solely for Colette, an animation video piece and limited run products, in addition to limited edition inflatable Malfi heads and Rainbow Mr. TTT bop bags.\n\n'Happy Rainbow, installed at the Tuen Mun Town Plaza, in Hong Kong from July 22 to September 2, 2012 was a colorful interactive bounce house which also featured fiberglass, plush and resin sculpture installations. FWY designed the installation as a modern shrine which also embodies their themes of play and spirituality. \"FWY hopes to evoke a spiritual connectivity that will enlighten all visitors. Each piece in the exhibition is charged with so much color and power that it brings great harmony to all who look upon it,\" the group wrote.\n\nMuch like Murakami, Arturo Herrera, Yayoi Kusama, and others FWY take a spiritual and serene approach to form and figure in the :) exhibition. The artists consider these works to be part of the “service art” movement, allowing for the viewer to easily understand their message and not be categorized as “pretentious art”. FWY feels art is for everyone and can aid in connecting humankind.\n\nInner Space, The Secrets of the Unknown featured bright wooden sculptures, introspective metal beings and FriendsWithYou's signature inflatable artwork. The installation ran at The Hole NYC annex in Miami from December 1, 2011 to January 28, 2012. FWY explained that “the pieces on display are figurative self reflective treasures, levitating in a space continuum, revealing something otherwise inaccessible.\"\n\nBuilding Blocks, featured at Art Basel in Miami from December 2, 2010 to January 8, 2011, featured FriendsWithYou's trademark playful inflatables as well as prints. The installation consisted of paintings created over the course of a decade. The paintings were meant to be flat extensions of FriendsWithYou's existing sculptural, graphical and experiential installation works and were created to allow or encourage viewers to project their own emotions onto.. The pieces were presented alongside the series of paintings, FWY exhibited select sculptural pieces, meant to illustrate the progression between their installation and the “portraiture.”\nRainbow City was an interactive installation containing minimalist inflatable forms from 8' to 50' borrowing their aesthetics from toy-like geometries and designs. Originally commissioned in 2010 by the Luminato Arts Foundation in Toronto, Canada, Rainbow City was then exhibited at Art Basel Miami 2010 presented by Paper Magazine, Pharrell Williams, and Aol. About 20,000 people visited the installation and were able to participate by bouncing about inside the inflatable structures and wandering in and around the surreal landscape. On June 6, 2010 to open section 2 of the High Line in New York City, a collection of 40 air-filled sculptures filled 16,000 square feet of outdoor space in Chelsea. It was FWY's first large scale interactive installation in New York City. According to the artists, Rainbow City was created to allow the viewer to reinterpret spirituality. The large totems represented self-reflective portraits, in line with FWY’s goal of evoking visitors to see their emotions and own self within the sculptural pieces. Visitors were encouraged to come and “be in awe of these large, reduced shaped and simple totems,” stated Arturo Sandoval III. By evoking play through very simple form, FriendsWithYou feels an almost religious scenario of connectivity is created in this interactive installation.\n\nThe Fun House, described as \"a giant, anthropomorphic bounce house intended to help unleash the visitors’ inner brats and in doing so, take advantage of the healing power of fun,\" was originally commissioned by 944 magazine and the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas in 2008. It grew as the installation traveled around the world. As a part of Art Basel Miami 2008 FriendsWithYou was the main featured artist at the Scope Art Fair. Their Fun House installation (December 3rd to December 7th) featured a large bounce house with a smiling face design, filled with inflatable balls, a bounce house, a romper room, restaurant, and a FWY store and fine art gallery. It was also installed at the Welt Museum in Berlin from March 19th to May 3rd, 2009. and the Nada Art Fair, New York.\n\nDream Maker was an installation of rotating spherical objects with faces similar to a miniature solar system. It was up at the Indianapolis Museum of Art from May 2, 2008 to November 9, 2008.\n\nRainbow Valley is a playground designed by FriendsWithYou located at the Aventura Mall in Miami. It was commissioned as a part of the mall’s “Turnberry for the Arts” program, which was founded to help promote the arts by “displaying world class artwork created by both celebrated contemporary artists and talented local artists in Aventura and the surrounding Miami area.” Other artists in the collection include: Daniel Arsham, Louise Bourgeois, Julian Opie, Tom Otterness, Gary Hume, Lawrence Weiner and Jorge Pardo It opened on December 21, 2006 and was their first permanent installation. The playground has rainbow bridges, slides, a control center, crawl-in mountains in bright colors and the entire area is foam-covered. The installation was meant to foster creativity in children through its interactivity though a storyline of a small mountain, who loses his family, on a search for other mountains to play with. \"The playground will guide children through Peeko, the baby mountain, and his adventure with Cloudy, his new found friend, to the magical Rainbow Valley.\" Wired described it as \"a warped Mario Bros. level\"\n\nCloud City opened in 2005 at the MOCA warehouse during the annual Art Basel in Miami. It was set up as an interactive playground composed of geometric shapes such inflatable spheres, padded 10 foot cones on casters, and pillowed cylinders. The oversized geometric forms and colors invited participation on the part of the viewers in Cloud City, \"an adventurous dream world playground designed to reinvigorate audiences with childlike energy and optimism.\" Several of the objects replicated the facial design of their character The boy. The central figure in this installation, The boy is an archetype that embodies youth and naïve creation.). With the start of Cloud City FriendsWithYou also released a CD music album of the same name featuring music artists such as PonPoko, Phoenicia, Otto VaN Shirach, and Sam.\n\nCloudy is a video installation that launched exclusively on \"'Pharrell Williams'\"'s \"'i am OTHER'\" \"'YouTube'\" channel. \"Cloudy\" is a short by artists Samuel Borkson and Arturo Sandoval III. The animated piece is an exploration into the clouds; a sweet, visual soundscape that takes the viewer through a personal journey into the sky. It invites viewers to follow a cast of clouds and raindrops through an entrancing adventure. FriendsWithYou explores animism, giving the main cast of characters a soul. The purpose of the piece is to transcend the viewer to a peaceful and joyous state. Clouds singing and performing their duties in a joyful manner show us that everything in our world has a role and a purpose.\n\nSkywalkers Parade was commissioned by Scion and was a collaboration with other artists such as Ara Peterson, Misaki Kawai, MumbleBoy, Paper Rad, David Choe, and DEVILROBOTS. It consisted of a number of balloons sizing from 5 feet to 60 feet and premiered on December 7, 2006 during Art Basel Miami. FWY conceived the Skywalkers Parade as “a collaborative way to tell a beautiful story through an enchanted parade in the sky.\n\nGet Lucky was an installation located in the Miami based art space The Box which ran from August 28th to September 25th, 2004. It featured six different altars, with a focus on pyramid, conical, or triangular shapes, covering different aspects of human life and death. The Fur Liaison was a furry monster character who accompanied guests around the installation. The Installation aimed to be an \"adventure into a modern ritual that empowers us to realize the significant effect we can pose on the world and a chance to alter it to a more balanced state to achieve happiness.\" (It also was featured at the Merry Karnowsky Gallery in Los Angeles November 20, 2004 from January 15, 2005.)\n\nOther installations include Sweet Dreams at the de la Cruz Collection in Wynwood, Florida from October 21 to October 23, 2011; Wish Come True at Soovac, in Minneapolis, Minnesota from September 28 to October 27, 2007; We Are Friends at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis on September 16, 2007 and Power Pond at the Museum of Contemporary Art in North Miami from January 28, 2006 to January 20, 2008.\n\n\nFriendsWithYou refers to its toy-like characters as \"friends.\"\n\nThe friends include:\n\nAs one of their first projects, FWY created a soft sculptural toy line using their friends characters that was intended to empower collectors with interactive \"pseudo-amulets\" at an accessible price. Each toy or soft sculpture is produced in a small edition, typically not re-released, and given a persona described in a booklet-style tag affixed to it.\n\nFriendsWithYou's past works are the basis of \"True and the Rainbow Kingdom\", an animated series produced by Guru Studio for Netflix. The duo (together with Pharrell Williams' I Am Other, and Home Plate Entertainment) have participated in the development and production of the series.\n"}

Film is banned in Australia and Germany.\n\nUnable to bring in anymore money for Leroy, her abusive pimp, the pregnant Rose tries to run away in the middle of the night, but is caught by Leroy. Using a clothes hanger, Leroy performs an impromptu abortion on Rose, unintentionally killing her in the process. Leroy disposes of Rose's baby in a dumpster, where its cries attract the attention of a homeless man, who raises the disfigured child as \"Hanger\".\n\nOn his eighteenth birthday, the vagrant sends Hanger off to live with John, his biological father, who the man had earlier met at a junkyard. John informs Hanger that he has gotten him a job at the junkyard, and that he will be working there and living with Russell, an acquaintance with Down syndrome. As he drives away with Hanger, John runs over the homeless man (who was defecating in his tent) and joyously tells his long-lost son \"Welcome to the rest of your life!\" John gives Hanger a picture of Rose, and picks up a prostitute for him to have sex with, but upon seeing Hanger's mutilated face, the woman goes into hysterics, so John crushes her head in his truck door.\n\nWhile Hanger is watching pornography with Russell in their home, a Jehovah's Witness visits, and Hanger mauls and partially eats her while being cheered on by Russell. Later, John drops by, and reveals to Hanger that he has a plan to get revenge on Leroy for what he did to Rose. On his way out, John is approached by Foxy White, Leroy's girlfriend, who offers to help John kill Leroy. John turns down Foxy's offer, but says he will make Leroy suffer \"a little extra\" if Foxy watches over Hanger.\n\nWhile Hanger is at work, John is captured by Leroy and a prostitute named Trashy, who disfigure him with a blow torch, and a hanger. Foxy finds John and tries to release him, but Leroy walks in on this, and shoots Foxy in the head. As that occurs, Russell and Hanger are drugged by Phil, a co-worker, who rapes them while wearing a Santa suit; at one point, Phil inserts his penis into Hanger's leaking colostomy. Russell and Hanger get their revenge on Phil at the junkyard, knocking him out, and placing him under a pile of garbage. Russell goes home and drinks tea made from used tampons, but after getting a call from Hanger, Russell goes to the junkyard, and finds Nicole (the owner's daughter) unconscious in her office, Hanger having knocked her out with Phil's drugs.\n\nRussell takes Nicole's tampon, and she is later found by Leroy, who rapes her while she is unconscious, and threatens her into luring away Russell so Leroy can be alone with Hanger. Once he is in Nicole's office, Russell is seemingly killed by Leroy, who chokes him with one of Nicole's tampons. Outside, Hanger stomps Phil's head in, and is confronted by Leroy, but John (who was left for dead, but recovered and killed Trashy by shoving a douche up her nose) appears and calls Leroy out. Leroy and John fatally shoot each other, and a distraught Hanger runs off with the hysterical Nicole.\n\n\"Hanger\" was released Direct-to-Video by Breaking Glass Pictures on Nov 17, 2009.\n\nFilm Bizarro found \"Hanger\" to be \"a great entertaining trash-fest that has come the closest to being a true throwback to grindhouse cinema that any movie has so far\" despite the ending feeling erratic and anticlimactic. A three and a half was awarded by Severed Cinema, which wrote that \"\"Hanger\" is as entertaining as it is repulsive\" and \"the film is a fun campy horror comedy\". Independent Flicks commended the camerawork, editing, gore, and Dan Ellis's performance, but gave a four and half out of seven after deeming the film \"a bit too bizarre\" and \"something of a let down\" due to the \"cartoonish style\" that lessened its impact. \n\nA three out of five was awarded by Digital Retribution, which stated \"\"Hanger\" is hard to rate because it sets out to offend and will probably do so for virtually everyone, but that doesn't make it good\" and \"I found \"Hanger's\" padding and surrealism distracting and a bit boring\". The film was called \"Nicholson's nastiest piece of work yet\" by The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre, which deemed it \"worthless\" and one of the most \"vile\" films the website has covered. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "1784687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1784687", "title": "Heer Ranjha", "text": "Heer Ranjha\n\nHeer Ranjha is one of several popular tragic romances of Punjab. The others are \"Mirza Sahiba\" and \"Sohni Mahiwal\". There are several poetic narrations of the story, the most famous being 'Heer' by Waris Shah written in 1766. It tells the story of the love of Heer and her lover Ranjha.\n\n\"Heer Ranjha\" was written by Waris Shah. Some historians say that the story was the original work of Shah, written after he had fallen in love with a girl named Bhag Bhari. Others say that Heer and Ranjha were real personalities who lived under the Lodi dynasty and that Waris Shah later utilised these personalities for his story. Shah states that the story has a deeper meaning, referring to the unrelenting quest that man has towards God.\n\nRag Heer Ranjha. The invocation at the beginning, in one version:\n\nHeer is an extremely beautiful woman, born into a wealthy family of the Sial tribe in Jhang which is now Punjab, Pakistan. Ranjha (whose first name is Dheedo; Ranjha is the surname,his caste is Ranjha[Jatt]), a Jat of the Ranjha tribe, is the youngest of four brothers and lives in the village of Takht Hazara by the river Chenab. Being his father's favorite son, unlike his brothers who had to toil in the lands, he led a life of ease, playing the flute ('Wanjhli'/'Bansuri'). After a quarrel with his brothers over land, Ranjha leaves home. In Waris Shah's version of the epic, it is said that Ranjha left his home because his brothers' wives refused to give him food. Eventually he arrives in Heer's village and falls in love with her. Heer's father offers Ranjha a job herding his cattle. Heer becomes mesmerised by the way Ranjha plays his flute and eventually falls in love with him. They meet each other secretly for many years until they are caught by Heer's jealous uncle, Kaido, and her parents Chuchak and Malki. Heer is forced by her family and the local priest or 'Maulvi' to marry another man named Saida Khera.\n\nRanjha is heartbroken. He wanders the countryside alone, until eventually he meets a Shaiva Jogi (ascetic). After meeting Gorakhnath, the founder of the \"Kanphata\" (pierced ear) sect of jogis at Tilla Jogian (the 'Hill of Ascetics', located 50 miles north of the historic town of Bhera, Sargodha District, Punjab), Ranjha becomes a jogi himself, piercing his ears and renouncing the material world. While reciting the name of the Lord, he wanders all over Punjab, eventually finding the village where Heer now lives.\n\nThe two return to Heer's village, where Heer's parents agree to their marriage - though some versions of the story state that the parent's agreement is only a deception. On the wedding day, Kaido poisons her food so that the wedding will not take place, in order to punish the girl for her behaviour. Hearing this news, Ranjha rushes to aid Heer, but is too late, as she has already eaten the poison and has died. Brokenhearted once again, Ranjha eats the remaining poisoned \"Laddu\" (sweet) which Heer has eaten and dies by her side.\n\nHeer and Ranjha are buried in Heer's hometown, Jhang. Love-smitten couples and others often pay visits to their mausoleum.\nBecause its plot involves a romance opposed by family members and ends with the two lovers dying, the story is often compared to the Shakespeare play \"Romeo and Juliet\".\n\nThe epic poem has been made into several feature films between 1928 and 2013.\n\nIn 2013, the television serial \"Heer Ranjha\", directed by Shahid Zahoor and produced by Yousuf Salahuddin, aired on PTV Home.\n\nThe British musician Panjabi MC references the tale of Heer and Ranjha in his 2003 song \"Jogi\". It has been sung by various Pakistani singers, including the classical/traditional artist Ghulam Ali.\n\nThe tale is mentioned in popular Bollywood songs such as \"Ranjha\" by Rupesh Kumar Ram from the movie \"Queen\" ,\"Ranjha Ranjha\" by Rekha Bhardwaj and Javed Ali from the movie \"Raavan\" and \"Dariya\" from the movie \"Baar Baar Dekho\".\n\nThe names of Heer and Ranjha have been referred in the song lyrics of \"One Love: The Taj Anthem\" by A.R.Rahman.\n\nAlam Lohar is renowned for reciting Heer in various styles and one of the first international folk singers to bring this story in a song format.\n\nOne of the songs of \"Jab Tak Hain Jaan\" (a film starring Shahrukh Khan,Katrina Kaif) has been named \"Heer\".\n\n\n"}

They collaborated in 1819–1820 on the book \"Visionary Heads\", written by Varley and illustrated by Blake. He was the elder brother of a family of artists: Cornelius Varley, William Fleetwood Varley, and Elizabeth, who married the painter William Mulready.\n\nJohn Varley was born at the \"Old Blue Post Tavern\", Hackney, on 17 August 1778. His father, Richard Varley, born at Epworth in Lincolnshire, had settled in London after the death of his first wife in Yorkshire. His parents discouraged his leanings towards art, and placed him under a silversmith. But on their death he was for a brief time employed by a portrait painter in Holborn and then, at the age of 15 or 16, he became a pupil of Joseph Charles Barrow (fl. 1789–1802) who had an evening drawing school twice a week at 12 Furnival's Inn Court, Holborn. It was Barrow who took Varley on a sketching tour to Peterborough from which he emerged as a professional painter. In 1798 he exhibited a highly regarded sketch of Peterborough Cathedral at the Royal Academy and became a regular exhibitor at the RA until the foundation of the \"Old Watercolour Society\" in 1805.\n\nIn 1799 he visited North Wales, and in its wild mountain scenery found the subjects best suited to his brush. He returned to the same district in 1800, and again in 1802, and the impressions then received powerfully influenced the whole course of his art.\n\nAs one of the founders of the OWS, Varley exhibited largely there over 700 drawings. He also became a highly successful drawing master with pupils including Copley Fielding, David Cox, John Linnell and William Turner (artist) of Oxford. Despite his success, his growing family meant he was constantly in financial difficulties, \"since he was both a hopeless businessman and by temperament something of a Micawber\". (Mallalieu). Varley was particularly skilled at the laying of flat washes of watercolour which suited the placid, contemplative mood that he often sought to evoke.\n\nVarley published \"A Treatise on the Principles of Landscape Drawing\", 1816–21 and \"A Practical Treatise on the Art of Drawing in Perspective\". He also wrote an astrological text (with illustrations) entitled \"A Treatise on Zodiacal Physiognomy\" in 1828.\n\nHe is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery.\n\nAccording to the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" Eleventh Edition, \"Varley's landscapes are graceful and solemn in feeling, and simple and broad in treatment, being worked with a full brush and pure fresh transparent tints, usually without any admixture of body-colour. Though his works are rather mannered and conventional, they are well considered and excellent in composition. Some of his earlier water-colours, including his \"Views of the Thames,\" were painted upon the spot, and possess greater individuality than his later productions, which are mainly compositions of mountain and lake scenery, produced without direct reference to nature.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16743", "title": "Karl Marx", "text": "Karl Marx\n\nKarl Marx (; 5 May 1818 – 14 March 1883) was a German philosopher, economist, historian, sociologist, political theorist, journalist and socialist revolutionary.\n\nBorn in Trier, Germany, to a Jewish middle-class family, Marx studied law and philosophy at university. Due to his political publications, Marx became stateless and lived in exile in London for decades, where he continued to develop his thought in collaboration with German thinker Friedrich Engels and publish his writings, researching in the reading room of the British Museum. His best-known titles are the 1848 pamphlet, \"The Communist Manifesto\", and the three-volume \"\". His political and philosophical thought had enormous influence on subsequent intellectual, economic and political history and his name has been used as an adjective, a noun and a school of social theory.\n\nMarx's theories about society, economics and politics—collectively understood as Marxism—hold that human societies develop through class struggle. In capitalism, this manifests itself in the conflict between the ruling classes (known as the bourgeoisie) that control the means of production and the working classes (known as the proletariat) that enable these means by selling their labour power in return for wages. Employing a critical approach known as historical materialism, Marx predicted that, like previous socio-economic systems, capitalism produced internal tensions which would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system: socialism. For Marx, class antagonisms under capitalism, owing in part to its instability and crisis-prone nature, would eventuate the working class' development of class consciousness, leading to their conquest of political power and eventually the establishment of a classless, communist society constituted by a free association of producers. Marx actively pressed for its implementation, arguing that the working class should carry out organised revolutionary action to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic emancipation.\n\nMarx has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history, and his work has been both lauded and criticised. His work in economics laid the basis for much of the current understanding of labour and its relation to capital, and subsequent economic thought. Many intellectuals, labour unions, artists and political parties worldwide have been influenced by Marx's work, with many modifying or adapting his ideas. Marx is typically cited as one of the principal architects of modern social science.\n\nMarx was born on 5 May 1818 to Heinrich Marx (1777–1838) and Henriette Pressburg (1788–1863). He was born at Brückengasse 664 in Trier, a town then part of the Kingdom of Prussia's Province of the Lower Rhine. Marx was ethnically Jewish. His maternal grandfather was a Dutch rabbi, while his paternal line had supplied Trier's rabbis since 1723, a role taken by his grandfather Meier Halevi Marx. His father, as a child known as Herschel, was the first in the line to receive a secular education. He became a lawyer and lived a relatively wealthy and middle-class existence, with his family owning a number of Moselle vineyards. Prior to his son's birth, and after the abrogation of Jewish emancipation in the Rhineland, Herschel converted from Judaism to join the state Evangelical Church of Prussia, taking on the German forename Heinrich over the Yiddish Herschel. Marx was a third cousin once removed of German Romantic poet Heinrich Heine, also born to a German Jewish family in the Rhineland, with whom he became a frequent correspondent in later life.\n\nLargely non-religious, Heinrich was a man of the Enlightenment, interested in the ideas of the philosophers Immanuel Kant and Voltaire. A classical liberal, he took part in agitation for a constitution and reforms in Prussia, at that time being an absolute monarchy. In 1815, Heinrich Marx began working as an attorney and in 1819 moved his family to a ten-room property near the Porta Nigra. His wife, Henriette Pressburg, was a Dutch Jewish woman from a prosperous business family that later founded the company Philips Electronics. Her sister Sophie Pressburg (1797–1854) married Lion Philips (1794–1866) and was the grandmother of both Gerard and Anton Philips and great-grandmother to Frits Philips. Lion Philips was a wealthy Dutch tobacco manufacturer and industrialist, upon whom Karl and Jenny Marx would later often come to rely for loans while they were exiled in London.\n\nLittle is known of Marx's childhood. The third of nine children, he became the eldest son when his brother Moritz died in 1819. Young Marx and his surviving siblings, Sophie, Hermann, Henriette, Louise, Emilie and Caroline, were baptised into the Lutheran Church in August 1824 and their mother in November 1825. Young Marx was privately educated by his father until 1830, when he entered Trier High School, whose headmaster, Hugo Wyttenbach, was a friend of his father. By employing many liberal humanists as teachers, Wyttenbach incurred the anger of the local conservative government. Subsequently, police raided the school in 1832 and discovered that literature espousing political liberalism was being distributed among the students. Considering the distribution of such material a seditious act, the authorities instituted reforms and replaced several staff during Marx's attendance.\n\nIn October 1835 at the age of 17, Marx travelled to the University of Bonn wishing to study philosophy and literature, but his father insisted on law as a more practical field. Due to a condition referred to as a \"weak chest\", Marx was excused from military duty when he turned 18. While at the University at Bonn, Marx joined the Poets' Club, a group containing political radicals that were monitored by the police. Marx also joined the Trier Tavern Club drinking society (\"Landsmannschaft der Treveraner\"), at one point serving as club co-president. Additionally, Marx was involved in certain disputes, some of which became serious: in August 1836 he took part in a duel with a member of the university's Borussian Korps. Although his grades in the first term were good, they soon deteriorated, leading his father to force a transfer to the more serious and academic University of Berlin.\n\nSpending summer and autumn 1836 in Trier, Marx became more serious about his studies and his life. He became engaged to Jenny von Westphalen, an educated baroness of the Prussian ruling class who had known Marx since childhood. As she had broken off her engagement with a young aristocrat to be with Marx, their relationship was socially controversial owing to the differences between their religious and class origins, but Marx befriended her father Ludwig von Westphalen (a liberal aristocrat) and later dedicated his doctoral thesis to him. Seven years after their engagement, on 19 June 1843 they got married in a Protestant church in Kreuznach.\n\nIn October 1836, Marx arrived in Berlin, matriculating in the university's faculty of law and renting a room in the Mittelstrasse. During the first term, Marx attended lectures of Eduard Gans who represented the progressive Hegelian standpoint, elaborated on rational development in history by emphasizing particularly its libertarian aspects, and the importance of social question, and lectures of Karl von Savigny who represented the Historical School of Law. Although studying law, he was fascinated by philosophy and looked for a way to combine the two, believing that \"without philosophy nothing could be accomplished\". Marx became interested in the recently deceased German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel, whose ideas were then widely debated among European philosophical circles. During a convalescence in Stralau, he joined the Doctor's Club (\"Doktorklub\"), a student group which discussed Hegelian ideas and through them became involved with a group of radical thinkers known as the Young Hegelians in 1837. They gathered around Ludwig Feuerbach and Bruno Bauer, with Marx developing a particularly close friendship with Adolf Rutenberg. Like Marx, the Young Hegelians were critical of Hegel's metaphysical assumptions, but adopted his dialectical method in order to criticise established society, politics and religion from a leftist perspective. Marx's father died in May 1838, resulting in a diminished income for the family. Marx had been emotionally close to his father and treasured his memory after his death.\n\nBy 1837, Marx was writing both fiction and non-fiction, having completed a short novel, \"Scorpion and Felix\", a drama, \"Oulanem\", as well as a number of love poems dedicated to Jenny von Westphalen, though none of this early work was published during his lifetime. Marx soon abandoned fiction for other pursuits, including the study of both English and Italian, art history and the translation of Latin classics. He began co-operating with Bruno Bauer on editing Hegel's \"Philosophy of Religion\" in 1840. Marx was also engaged in writing his doctoral thesis, \"The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature\", which he completed in 1841. It was described as \"a daring and original piece of work in which Marx set out to show that theology must yield to the superior wisdom of philosophy\". The essay was controversial, particularly among the conservative professors at the University of Berlin. Marx decided instead to submit his thesis to the more liberal University of Jena, whose faculty awarded him his PhD in April 1841. As Marx and Bauer were both atheists, in March 1841 they began plans for a journal entitled \"Archiv des Atheismus\" (\"Atheistic Archives\"), but it never came to fruition. In July, Marx and Bauer took a trip to Bonn from Berlin. There they scandalised their class by getting drunk, laughing in church and galloping through the streets on donkeys.\n\nMarx was considering an academic career, but this path was barred by the government's growing opposition to classical liberalism and the Young Hegelians. Marx moved to Cologne in 1842, where he became a journalist, writing for the radical newspaper \"Rheinische Zeitung\" (\"Rhineland News\"), expressing his early views on socialism and his developing interest in economics. Marx criticised both right-wing European governments as well as figures in the liberal and socialist movements whom he thought ineffective or counter-productive. The newspaper attracted the attention of the Prussian government censors, who checked every issue for seditious material before printing, as Marx lamented: \"Our newspaper has to be presented to the police to be sniffed at, and if the police nose smells anything un-Christian or un-Prussian, the newspaper is not allowed to appear\". After the \"Rheinische Zeitung\" published an article strongly criticising the Russian monarchy, Tsar Nicholas I requested it be banned and Prussia's government complied in 1843.\n\nIn 1843, Marx became co-editor of a new, radical leftist Parisian newspaper, the \"Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher\" (\"German-French Annals\"), then being set up by the German socialist Arnold Ruge to bring together German and French radicals and thus Marx and his wife moved to Paris in October 1843. Initially living with Ruge and his wife communally at 23 Rue Vaneau, they found the living conditions difficult, so moved out following the birth of their daughter Jenny in 1844. Although intended to attract writers from both France and the German states, the \"Jahrbücher\" was dominated by the latter and the only non-German writer was the exiled Russian anarchist collectivist Mikhail Bakunin. Marx contributed two essays to the paper, \"Introduction to a Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right\" and \"On the Jewish Question\", the latter introducing his belief that the proletariat were a revolutionary force and marking his embrace of communism. Only one issue was published, but it was relatively successful, largely owing to the inclusion of Heinrich Heine's satirical odes on King Ludwig of Bavaria, leading the German states to ban it and seize imported copies (Ruge nevertheless refused to fund the publication of further issues and his friendship with Marx broke down). After the paper's collapse, Marx began writing for the only uncensored German-language radical newspaper left, \"Vorwärts!\" (\"Forward!\"). Based in Paris, the paper was connected to the League of the Just, a utopian socialist secret society of workers and artisans. Marx attended some of their meetings, but did not join. In \"Vorwärts!\", Marx refined his views on socialism based upon Hegelian and Feuerbachian ideas of dialectical materialism, at the same time criticising liberals and other socialists operating in Europe.\n\nOn 28 August 1844, Marx met the German socialist Friedrich Engels at the Café de la Régence, beginning a lifelong friendship. Engels showed Marx his recently published \"The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844\", convincing Marx that the working class would be the agent and instrument of the final revolution in history. Soon, Marx and Engels were collaborating on a criticism of the philosophical ideas of Marx's former friend, Bruno Bauer. This work was published in 1845 as \"The Holy Family\". Although critical of Bauer, Marx was increasingly influenced by the ideas of the Young Hegelians Max Stirner and Ludwig Feuerbach, but eventually Marx and Engels abandoned Feuerbachian materialism as well.\n\nDuring the time that he lived at 38 Rue Vanneau in Paris (from October 1843 until January 1845), Marx engaged in an intensive study of political economy (Adam Smith, David Ricardo, James Mill, \"etc.\")\",\" the French socialists (especially Claude Henri St. Simon and Charles Fourier) and the history of France. The study of political economy is a study that Marx would pursue for the rest of his life and would result in his major economic workthe three-volume series called \"Capital\". Marxism is based in large part on three influences: Hegel's dialectics, French utopian socialism and English economics. Together with his earlier study of Hegel's dialectics, the studying that Marx did during this time in Paris meant that all major components of \"Marxism\" were in place by the autumn of 1844. Marx was constantly being pulled away from his study of political economynot only by the usual daily demands of the time, but additionally by editing a radical newspaper and later by organising and directing the efforts of a political party during years of potentially revolutionary popular uprisings of the citizenry. Still Marx was always drawn back to his economic studies: he sought \"to understand the inner workings of capitalism\".\n\nAn outline of \"Marxism\" had definitely formed in the mind of Karl Marx by late 1844. Indeed, many features of the Marxist view of the world's political economy had been worked out in great detail, but Marx needed to write down all of the details of his economic world view to further clarify the new economic theory in his own mind. Accordingly, Marx wrote \"The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts\". These manuscripts covered numerous topics, detailing Marx's concept of alienated labour. However, by the spring of 1845 his continued study of political economy, capital and capitalism had led Marx to the belief that the new political economic theory that he was espousing—scientific socialism—needed to be built on the base of a thoroughly developed materialistic view of the world.\n\nThe \"Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844\" had been written between April and August 1844, but soon Marx recognised that the \"Manuscripts\" had been influenced by some inconsistent ideas of Ludwig Feuerbach. Accordingly, Marx recognised the need to break with Feuerbach's philosophy in favour of historical materialism, thus a year later (in April 1845) after moving from Paris to Brussels, Marx wrote his eleven \"Theses on Feuerbach\". The \"Theses on Feuerbach\" are best known for Thesis 11, which states that \"philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways, the point is to change it\". This work contains Marx's criticism of materialism (for being contemplative), idealism (for reducing practice to theory) overall, criticising philosophy for putting abstract reality above the physical world. It thus introduced the first glimpse at Marx's historical materialism, an argument that the world is changed not by ideas but by actual, physical, material activity and practice. In 1845, after receiving a request from the Prussian king, the French government shut down \"Vorwärts!\", with the interior minister, François Guizot, expelling Marx from France. At this point, Marx moved from Paris to Brussels, where Marx hoped to once again continue his study of capitalism and political economy.\n\nUnable either to stay in France or to move to Germany, Marx decided to emigrate to Brussels in Belgium in February 1845. However, to stay in Belgium he had to pledge not to publish anything on the subject of contemporary politics. In Brussels, Marx associated with other exiled socialists from across Europe, including Moses Hess, Karl Heinzen and Joseph Weydemeyer. In April 1845, Engels moved from Barmen in Germany to Brussels to join Marx and the growing cadre of members of the League of the Just now seeking home in Brussels. Later, Mary Burns, Engels' long-time companion, left Manchester, England to join Engels in Brussels.\n\nIn mid-July 1845, Marx and Engels left Brussels for England to visit the leaders of the Chartists, a socialist movement in Britain. This was Marx's first trip to England and Engels was an ideal guide for the trip. Engels had already spent two years living in Manchester from November 1842 to August 1844. Not only did Engels already know the English language, he had also developed a close relationship with many Chartist leaders. Indeed, Engels was serving as a reporter for many Chartist and socialist English newspapers. Marx used the trip as an opportunity to examine the economic resources available for study in various libraries in London and Manchester.\n\nIn collaboration with Engels, Marx also set about writing a book which is often seen as his best treatment of the concept of historical materialism, \"The German Ideology\". In this work, Marx broke with Ludwig Feuerbach, Bruno Bauer, Max Stirner and the rest of the Young Hegelians, while he also broke with Karl Grun and other \"true socialists\" whose philosophies were still based in part on \"idealism\". In \"German Ideology\", Marx and Engels finally completed their philosophy, which was based solely on materialism as the sole motor force in history. \"German Ideology\" is written in a humorously satirical form, but even this satirical form did not save the work from censorship. Like so many other early writings of his, \"German Ideology\" would not be published in Marx's lifetime and would be published only in 1932.\n\nAfter completing \"German Ideology\", Marx turned to a work that was intended to clarify his own position regarding \"the theory and tactics\" of a truly \"revolutionary proletarian movement\" operating from the standpoint of a truly \"scientific materialist\" philosophy. This work was intended to draw a distinction between the utopian socialists and Marx's own scientific socialist philosophy. Whereas the utopians believed that people must be persuaded one person at a time to join the socialist movement, the way a person must be persuaded to adopt any different belief, Marx knew that people would tend on most occasions to act in accordance with their own economic interests, thus appealing to an entire class (the working class in this case) with a broad appeal to the class's best material interest would be the best way to mobilise the broad mass of that class to make a revolution and change society. This was the intent of the new book that Marx was planning, but to get the manuscript past the government censors he called the book \"The Poverty of Philosophy\" (1847) and offered it as a response to the \"petty bourgeois philosophy\" of the French anarchist socialist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon as expressed in his book \"The Philosophy of Poverty\" (1840).\n\nThese books laid the foundation for Marx and Engels's most famous work, a political pamphlet that has since come to be commonly known as \"The Communist Manifesto\". While residing in Brussels in 1846, Marx continued his association with the secret radical organisation League of the Just. As noted above, Marx thought the League to be just the sort of radical organisation that was needed to spur the working class of Europe toward the mass movement that would bring about a working class revolution. However, to organise the working class into a mass movement the League had to cease its \"secret\" or \"underground\" orientation and operate in the open as a political party. Members of the League eventually became persuaded in this regard. Accordingly, in June 1847 the League was reorganised by its membership into a new open \"above ground\" political society that appealed directly to the working classes. This new open political society was called the Communist League. Both Marx and Engels participated in drawing up the programme and organisational principles of the new Communist League.\n\nIn late 1847, Marx and Engels began writing what was to become their most famous work — a programme of action for the Communist League. Written jointly by Marx and Engels from December 1847 to January 1848, \"The Communist Manifesto\" was first published on 21 February 1848. \"The Communist Manifesto\" laid out the beliefs of the new Communist League. No longer a secret society, the Communist League wanted to make aims and intentions clear to the general public rather than hiding its beliefs as the League of the Just had been doing. The opening lines of the pamphlet set forth the principal basis of Marxism: \"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles\". It goes on to examine the antagonisms that Marx claimed were arising in the clashes of interest between the bourgeoisie (the wealthy capitalist class) and the proletariat (the industrial working class). Proceeding on from this, the \"Manifesto\" presents the argument for why the Communist League, as opposed to other socialist and liberal political parties and groups at the time, was truly acting in the interests of the proletariat to overthrow capitalist society and to replace it with socialism.\n\nLater that year, Europe experienced a series of protests, rebellions and often violent upheavals that became known as the Revolutions of 1848. In France, a revolution led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the French Second Republic. Marx was supportive of such activity and having recently received a substantial inheritance from his father (withheld by his uncle Lionel Philips since his father's death in 1838) of either 6,000 or 5,000 francs he allegedly used a third of it to arm Belgian workers who were planning revolutionary action. Although the veracity of these allegations is disputed, the Belgian Ministry of Justice accused Marx of it, subsequently arresting him and he was forced to flee back to France, where with a new republican government in power he believed that he would be safe.\n\nTemporarily settling down in Paris, Marx transferred the Communist League executive headquarters to the city and also set up a German Workers' Club with various German socialists living there. Hoping to see the revolution spread to Germany, in 1848 Marx moved back to Cologne where he began issuing a handbill entitled the \"Demands of the Communist Party in Germany\", in which he argued for only four of the ten points of the \"Communist Manifesto\", believing that in Germany at that time the bourgeoisie must overthrow the feudal monarchy and aristocracy before the proletariat could overthrow the bourgeoisie. On 1 June, Marx started publication of a daily newspaper, the \"Neue Rheinische Zeitung\", which he helped to finance through his recent inheritance from his father. Designed to put forward news from across Europe with his own Marxist interpretation of events, the newspaper featured Marx as a primary writer and the dominant editorial influence. Despite contributions by fellow members of the Communist League, according to Friedrich Engels it remained \"a simple dictatorship by Marx\".\n\nWhilst editor of the paper, Marx and the other revolutionary socialists were regularly harassed by the police and Marx was brought to trial on several occasions, facing various allegations including insulting the Chief Public Prosecutor, committing a press misdemeanor and inciting armed rebellion through tax boycotting, although each time he was acquitted. Meanwhile, the democratic parliament in Prussia collapsed and the king, Frederick William IV, introduced a new cabinet of his reactionary supporters, who implemented counter-revolutionary measures to expunge leftist and other revolutionary elements from the country. Consequently, the \"Neue Rheinische Zeitung\" was soon suppressed and Marx was ordered to leave the country on 16 May. Marx returned to Paris, which was then under the grip of both a reactionary counter-revolution and a cholera epidemic and was soon expelled by the city authorities, who considered him a political threat. With his wife Jenny expecting their fourth child and not able to move back to Germany or Belgium, in August 1849 he sought refuge in London.\n\nMarx moved to London in early June 1849 and would remain based in the city for the rest of his life. The headquarters of the Communist League also moved to London. However, in the winter of 1849–1850 a split within the ranks of the Communist League occurred when a faction within it led by August Willich and Karl Schapper began agitating for an immediate uprising. Willich and Schapper believed that once the Communist League had initiated the uprising, the entire working class from across Europe would rise \"spontaneously\" to join it, thus creating revolution across Europe. Marx and Engels protested that such an unplanned uprising on the part of the Communist League was \"adventuristic\" and would be suicide for the Communist League. Such an uprising as that recommended by the Schapper/Willich group would easily be crushed by the police and the armed forces of the reactionary governments of Europe. Marx maintained that this would spell doom for the Communist League itself, arguing that changes in society are not achieved overnight through the efforts and will power of a handful of men. They are instead brought about through a scientific analysis of economic conditions of society and by moving toward revolution through different stages of social development. In the present stage of development (\"circa\" 1850), following the defeat of the uprisings across Europe in 1848 he felt that the Communist League should encourage the working class to unite with progressive elements of the rising bourgeoisie to defeat the feudal aristocracy on issues involving demands for governmental reforms, such as a constitutional republic with freely elected assemblies and universal (male) suffrage. In other words, the working class must join with bourgeois and democratic forces to bring about the successful conclusion of the bourgeois revolution before stressing the working class agenda and a working class revolution.\n\nAfter a long struggle which threatened to ruin the Communist League, Marx's opinion prevailed and eventually the Willich/Schapper group left the Communist League. Meanwhile, Marx also became heavily involved with the socialist German Workers' Educational Society. The Society held their meetings in Great Windmill Street, Soho, central London's entertainment district. This organisation was also racked by an internal struggle between its members, some of whom followed Marx while others followed the Schapper/Willich faction. The issues in this internal split were the same issues raised in the internal split within the Communist League, but Marx lost the fight with the Schapper/Willich faction within the German Workers' Educational Society and on 17 September 1850 resigned from the Society.\n\nIn the early period in London, Marx committed himself almost exclusively to revolutionary activities, such that his family endured extreme poverty. His main source of income was Engels, whose own source was his wealthy industrialist father. In Prussia as editor of his own newspaper, and contributor to others ideologically aligned, Marx could reach his audience, the working classes. In London, without finances to run a newspaper themselves, he and Engels turned to international journalism. At one stage they were being published by six newspapers from England, the United States, Prussia, Austria and South Africa. Marx's principal earnings came from his work as European correspondent, from 1852 to 1862, for the \"New-York Daily Tribune\", and from also producing articles for more \"bourgeois\" newspapers. Marx had his articles translated from German by , until his proficiency in English had become adequate.\n\nThe \"New-York Daily Tribune\" had been founded in April 1841 by Horace Greeley. Its editorial board contained progressive bourgeois journalists and publishers, among them George Ripley and the journalist Charles Dana, who was editor-in-chief. Dana, a fourierist and an abolitionist, was Marx's contact. \n\nThe \"Tribune\" was a vehicle for Marx to reach a transatlantic public to make a \"hidden war\" to Henry Charles Carey. The journal had wide working-class appeal from its foundation; at two cents, it was inexpensive; and, with about 50,000 copies per issue, its circulation was the widest in the United States. Its editorial ethos was progressive and its anti-slavery stance reflected Greeley's. Marx's first article for the paper, on the British parliamentary elections, was published on 21 August 1852.\n\nOn 21 March 1857 Dana informed Marx that, due to the economic recession, only one article a week would be paid for, published or not; the others would be paid for only if published. Marx had sent his articles on Tuesdays and Fridays, but, that October, the \"Tribune\" discharged all its correspondents in Europe except Marx and B. Taylor, and reduced Marx to a weekly article. Between September and November 1860, only five were published. After a six-month interval, Marx resumed contributions in September 1861 until March 1862, when Dana wrote to inform him that there was no longer space in the \"Tribune\" for reports from London, due to American domestic affairs.\nIn 1868, Dana set up a rival newspaper, the \"New York Sun\", at which he was editor-in-chief.\n\nIn April 1857, Dana invited Marx to contribute articles, mainly on military history, to the \"New American Cyclopedia\", an idea of George Ripley, Dana's friend and literary editor of the \"Tribune\". In all, 67 Marx-Engels articles were published, of which 51 written by Engels, although Marx did some research for them in the British Museum.\n\nBy the late 1850s, American popular interest in European affairs waned and Marx's articles turned to topics such as the \"slavery crisis\" and the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, in the \"War Between the States\".\nBetween December 1851 and March 1852, Marx worked on his theoretical work about the French Revolution of 1848, titled \"The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon\". In this he explored concepts in historical materialism, class struggle, dictatorship of the proletariat, and victory of the proletariat over the bourgeois state.\n\nThe 1850s and 1860s may be said to mark a philosophical boundary distinguishing the young Marx's Hegelian idealism and the more mature Marx's scientific ideology associated with structural Marxism; however, not all scholars accept this distinction. For Marx and Engels, their experience of the Revolutions of 1848 to 1849 were formative in the development of their theory of economics and historical progression. After the \"failures\" of 1848, the revolutionary impetus appeared spent and not to be renewed without an economic recession. Contention arose between Marx and his fellow communists, whom he denounced as \"adventurists\". Marx deemed it fanciful to propose that \"will power\" could be sufficient to create the revolutionary conditions when in reality the economic component was the necessary requisite.\n\nRecession in the United States' economy in 1852 gave Marx and Engels grounds for optimism for revolutionary activity. Yet, this economy was seen as too immature for a capitalist revolution. Open territories on America's western frontier dissipated the forces of social unrest. Moreover, any economic crisis arising in the United States would not lead to revolutionary contagion of the older economies of individual European nations, which were closed systems bounded by their national borders. When the so-called \"Panic of 1857\" in the United States spread globally, it broke all economic theory models, and was the first truly global economic crisis.\n\nFinancial necessity had forced Marx to abandon economic studies in 1844 and give thirteen years to working on other projects. He had always sought to return to economics.\n\nMarx continued to write articles for the \"New York Daily Tribune\" as long as he was sure that the \"Tribune's\" editorial policy was still progressive. However, the departure of Charles Dana from the paper in late 1861 and the resultant change in the editorial board brought about a new editorial policy. No longer was the \"Tribune\" to be a strong abolitionist paper dedicated to a complete Union victory. The new editorial board supported an immediate peace between the Union and the Confederacy in the Civil War in the United States with slavery left intact in the Confederacy. Marx strongly disagreed with this new political position and in 1863 was forced to withdraw as a writer for the \"Tribune.\"\n\nIn 1864, Marx became involved in the International Workingmen's Association (also known as the First International), to whose General Council he was elected at its inception in 1864. In that organisation, Marx was involved in the struggle against the anarchist wing centred on Mikhail Bakunin (1814–1876). Although Marx won this contest, the transfer of the seat of the General Council from London to New York in 1872, which Marx supported, led to the decline of the International. The most important political event during the existence of the International was the Paris Commune of 1871, when the citizens of Paris rebelled against their government and held the city for two months. In response to the bloody suppression of this rebellion, Marx wrote one of his most famous pamphlets, \"The Civil War in France\", a defence of the Commune.\n\nGiven the repeated failures and frustrations of workers' revolutions and movements, Marx also sought to understand capitalism and spent a great deal of time in the reading room of the British Museum studying and reflecting on the works of political economists and on economic data. By 1857, Marx had accumulated over 800 pages of notes and short essays on capital, landed property, wage labour, the state and foreign trade and the world market, though this work did not appear in print until 1939 under the title \"\"Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy\"\".\n\nFinally in 1859, Marx published \"A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy\", his first serious economic work. This work was intended merely as a preview of his three-volume \"Das Kapital\" (English title: \"Capital: Critique of Political Economy\"), which he intended to publish at a later date. In \"A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy\", Marx expands on the labour theory of value advocated by David Ricardo. The work was enthusiastically received, and the edition sold out quickly.\n\nThe successful sales of \"A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy\" stimulated Marx in the early 1860s to finish work on the three large volumes that would compose his major life's work—\"Das Kapital\" and the \"Theories of Surplus Value\", which discussed the theoreticians of political economy, particularly Adam Smith and David Ricardo. \"Theories of Surplus Value\" is often referred to as the fourth volume of \"Das Kapital\" and constitutes one of the first comprehensive treatises on the history of economic thought. In 1867, the first volume of \"Das Kapital\" was published, a work which analysed the capitalist process of production. Here Marx elaborated his labour theory of value, which had been influenced by Thomas Hodgskin. Marx acknowledged Hodgskin's \"admirable work\" \"Labour Defended against the Claims of Capital\" at more than one point in \"Capital.\" Indeed, Marx quoted Hodgskin as recognising the alienation of labour that occurred under modern capitalist production. No longer was there any \"natural reward of individual labour. Each labourer produces only some part of a whole, and each part having no value or utility of itself, there is nothing on which the labourer can seize, and say: 'This is my product, this will I keep to myself'\". In this first volume of \"Capital\", Marx outlined his conception of surplus value and exploitation, which he argued would ultimately lead to a falling rate of profit and the collapse of industrial capitalism. Demand for a Russian language edition of \"Capital\" soon led to the printing of 3,000 copies of the book in the Russian language, which was published on 27 March 1872. By the autumn of 1871, the entire first edition of the German language edition of \"Capital\" had been sold out and a second edition was published.\n\nVolumes II and III of \"Capital\" remained mere manuscripts upon which Marx continued to work for the rest of his life. Both volumes were published by Engels after Marx's death. Volume II of \"Capital\" was prepared and published by Engels in July 1893 under the name \"Capital II: The Process of Circulation of Capital\". Volume III of \"Capital\" was published a year later in October 1894 under the name \"Capital III: The Process of Capitalist Production as a Whole\". \"Theories of Surplus Value\" derived from the sprawling \"Economic Manuscripts of 1861-1863\", a \"second\" draft for \"Capital\", the latter spanning volumes 30-34 of the \"Collected Works of Marx and Engels\". Specifically, \"Theories of Surplus Value\" runs from the latter part of the \"Collected Works' \" thirtieth volume through the end of their thirty-second volume; meanwhile, the larger \"Economic Manuscripts of 1861-1863\" run from the start of the \"Collected Works' \" thirtieth volume through the first half of their thirty-fourth volume. The latter half of the Collected Works' thirty-fourth volume consists of the surviving fragments of the \"Economic Manuscripts of 1863-1864\", which represented a \"third\" draft for Capital, and a large portion of which is included as an appendix to the Penguin edition of \"Capital\", volume I. A German language abridged edition of \"Theories of Surplus Value\" was published in 1905 and in 1910. This abridged edition was translated into English and published in 1951 in London, but the complete unabridged edition of \"Theories of Surplus Value\" was published as the \"fourth volume\" of \"Capital\" in 1963 and 1971 in Moscow.\n\nDuring the last decade of his life, Marx's health declined and he became incapable of the sustained effort that had characterised his previous work. He did manage to comment substantially on contemporary politics, particularly in Germany and Russia. His \"Critique of the Gotha Programme\" opposed the tendency of his followers Wilhelm Liebknecht and August Bebel to compromise with the state socialism of Ferdinand Lassalle in the interests of a united socialist party. This work is also notable for another famous Marx quote: \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his need\".\n\nIn a letter to Vera Zasulich dated 8 March 1881, Marx contemplated the possibility of Russia's bypassing the capitalist stage of development and building communism on the basis of the common ownership of land characteristic of the village \"mir\". While admitting that Russia's rural \"commune is the fulcrum of social regeneration in Russia\", Marx also warned that in order for the mir to operate as a means for moving straight to the socialist stage without a preceding capitalist stage it \"would first be necessary to eliminate the deleterious influences which are assailing it (the rural commune) from all sides\". Given the elimination of these pernicious influences, Marx allowed that \"normal conditions of spontaneous development\" of the rural commune could exist. However, in the same letter to Vera Zasulich he points out that \"at the core of the capitalist system ... lies the complete separation of the producer from the means of production\". In one of the drafts of this letter, Marx reveals his growing passion for anthropology, motivated by his belief that future communism would be a return on a higher level to the communism of our prehistoric past. He wrote that \"the historical trend of our age is the fatal crisis which capitalist production has undergone in the European and American countries where it has reached its highest peak, a crisis that will end in its destruction, in the return of modern society to a higher form of the most archaic type—collective production and appropriation\". He added that \"the vitality of primitive communities was incomparably greater than that of Semitic, Greek, Roman, \"etc\". societies, and, a fortiori, that of modern capitalist societies\". Before he died, Marx asked Engels to write up these ideas, which were published in 1884 under the title \"The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State\".\n\nMarx and von Westphalen had seven children together, but partly owing to the poor conditions in which they lived whilst in London, only three survived to adulthood. The children were: Jenny Caroline (m. Longuet; 1844–1883); Jenny Laura (m. Lafargue; 1845–1911); Edgar (1847–1855); Henry Edward Guy (\"Guido\"; 1849–1850); Jenny Eveline Frances (\"Franziska\"; 1851–1852); Jenny Julia Eleanor (1855–1898) and one more who died before being named (July 1857). There are allegations that Marx also fathered a son, Freddy, out of wedlock by his housekeeper, Helene Demuth.\n\nMarx frequently used pseudonyms, often when renting a house or flat, apparently to make it harder for the authorities to track him down. While in Paris, he used that of \"Monsieur Ramboz\", whilst in London he signed off his letters as \"A. Williams\". His friends referred to him as \"Moor\", owing to his dark complexion and black curly hair, while he encouraged his children to call him \"Old Nick\" and \"Charley\". He also bestowed nicknames and pseudonyms on his friends and family as well, referring to Friedrich Engels as \"General\", his housekeeper Helene as \"Lenchen\" or \"Nym\", while one of his daughters, Jennychen, was referred to as \"Qui Qui, Emperor of China\" and another, Laura, was known as \"Kakadou\" or \"the Hottentot\".\n\nMarx was afflicted by poor health (what he himself described as \"the wretchedness of existence\") and various authors have sought to describe and explain it. His biographer Werner Blumenberg attributed it to liver and gall problems which Marx had in 1849 and from which he was never afterwards free, exacerbated by an unsuitable lifestyle. The attacks often came with headaches, eye inflammation, neuralgia in the head and rheumatic pains. A serious nervous disorder appeared in 1877 and protracted insomnia was a consequence, which Marx fought with narcotics. The illness was aggravated by excessive nocturnal work and faulty diet. Marx was fond of highly seasoned dishes, smoked fish, caviare, pickled cucumbers, \"none of which are good for liver patients\", but he also liked wine and liqueurs and smoked an enormous amount \"and since he had no money, it was usually bad-quality cigars\". From 1863, Marx complained a lot about boils: \"These are very frequent with liver patients and may be due to the same causes\". The abscesses were so bad that Marx could neither sit nor work upright. According to Blumenberg, Marx's irritability is often found in liver patients:\n\nThe illness emphasised certain traits in his character. He argued cuttingly, his biting satire did not shrink at insults, and his expressions could be rude and cruel. Though in general Marx had a blind faith in his closest friends, nevertheless he himself complained that he was sometimes too mistrustful and unjust even to them. His verdicts, not only about enemies but even about friends, were sometimes so harsh that even less sensitive people would take offence… There must have been few whom he did not criticize like this… not even Engels was an exception.\n\nAccording to Princeton historian J.E. Seigel, in his late teens Marx may have had pneumonia or pleurisy, the effects of which led to his being exempted from Prussian military service. In later life whilst working on \"Capital\" (which he never completed), Marx suffered from a trio of afflictions. A liver ailment, probably hereditary, was aggravated by overwork, bad diet and lack of sleep. Inflammation of the eyes was induced by too much work at night. A third affliction, eruption of carbuncles or boils, \"was probably brought on by general physical debility to which the various features of Marx's style of life — alcohol, tobacco, poor diet, and failure to sleep — all contributed. Engels often exhorted Marx to alter this dangerous regime\". In Professor Siegel's thesis, what lay behind this punishing sacrifice of his health may have been guilt about self-involvement and egoism, originally induced in Karl Marx by his father.\n\nIn 2007, a retrodiagnosis of Marx's skin disease was made by dermatologist Sam Shuster of Newcastle University and for Shuster the most probable explanation was that Marx suffered not from liver problems, but from hidradenitis suppurativa, a recurring infective condition arising from blockage of apocrine ducts opening into hair follicles. This condition, which was not described in the English medical literature until 1933 (hence would not have been known to Marx's physicians), can produce joint pain (which could be misdiagnosed as rheumatic disorder) and painful eye conditions. To arrive at his retrodiagnosis, Shuster considered the primary material: the Marx correspondence published in the 50 volumes of the \"Marx/Engels Collected Works\". There, \"although the skin lesions were called 'furuncules', 'boils' and 'carbuncles' by Marx, his wife and his physicians, they were too persistent, recurrent, destructive and site-specific for that diagnosis\". The sites of the persistent 'carbuncles' were noted repeatedly in the armpits, groins, perianal, genital (penis and scrotum) and suprapubic regions and inner thighs, \"favoured sites of hidradenitis suppurativa\". Professor Shuster claimed the diagnosis \"can now be made definitively\".\n\nShuster went on to consider the potential psychosocial effects of the disease, noting that the skin is an organ of communication and that hidradenitis suppurativa produces much psychological distress, including loathing and disgust and depression of self-image, mood and well-being, feelings for which Shuster found \"much evidence\" in the Marx correspondence. Professor Shuster went on to ask himself whether the mental effects of the disease affected Marx's work and even helped him to develop his theory of alienation.\n\nFollowing the death of his wife Jenny in December 1881, Marx developed a catarrh that kept him in ill health for the last 15 months of his life. It eventually brought on the bronchitis and pleurisy that killed him in London on 14 March 1883 (age 64), dying a stateless person. Family and friends in London buried his body in Highgate Cemetery (East), London, on 17 March 1883 in an area reserved for agnostics and atheists (George Eliot's grave is nearby). There were between nine and eleven mourners at his funeral.\n\nSeveral of his closest friends spoke at his funeral, including Wilhelm Liebknecht and Friedrich Engels. Engels' speech included the passage: \n\nMarx's surviving daughters Eleanor and Laura, as well as Charles Longuet and Paul Lafargue, Marx's two French socialist sons-in-law, were also in attendance. He had been predeceased by his wife and his eldest daughter, the latter dying a few months earlier in January 1883. Liebknecht, a founder and leader of the German Social Democratic Party, gave a speech in German and Longuet, a prominent figure in the French working-class movement, made a short statement in French. Two telegrams from workers' parties in France and Spain were also read out. Together with Engels's speech, this constituted the entire programme of the funeral. Non-relatives attending the funeral included three communist associates of Marx: Friedrich Lessner, imprisoned for three years after the Cologne communist trial of 1852; G. Lochner, whom Engels described as \"an old member of the Communist League\"; and Carl Schorlemmer, a professor of chemistry in Manchester, a member of the Royal Society and a communist activist involved in the 1848 Baden revolution. Another attendee of the funeral was Ray Lankester, a British zoologist who would later become a prominent academic.\n\nUpon his own death in 1895, Engels left Marx's two surviving daughters a \"significant portion\" of his considerable estate (valued in 2011 at US$4.8m).\n\nMarx and his family were reburied on a new site nearby in November 1954. The tomb at the new site, unveiled on 14 March 1956, bears the carved message: \"Workers of All Lands Unite\", the final line of \"The Communist Manifesto\"; and, from the 11th \"Thesis on Feuerbach\" (as edited by Engels), \"The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various waysthe point however is to change it\". The Communist Party of Great Britain had the monument with a portrait bust by Laurence Bradshaw erected and Marx's original tomb had only humble adornment. In 1970, there was an unsuccessful attempt to destroy the monument using a homemade bomb.\n\nThe Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm remarked: \"One cannot say Marx died a failure\" because although he had not achieved a large following of disciples in Britain, his writings had already begun to make an impact on the leftist movements in Germany and Russia. Within 25 years of his death, the continental European socialist parties that acknowledged Marx's influence on their politics were each gaining between 15 and 47 per cent in those countries with representative democratic elections.\n\nMarx's thought demonstrates influences from many thinkers including, but not limited to:\n\nMarx's view of history, which came to be called historical materialism (controversially adapted as the philosophy of dialectical materialism by Engels and Lenin), certainly shows the influence of Hegel's claim that one should view reality (and history) dialectically. However, Hegel had thought in idealist terms, putting ideas in the forefront, whereas Marx sought to rewrite dialectics in materialist terms, arguing for the primacy of matter over idea. Where Hegel saw the \"spirit\" as driving history, Marx saw this as an unnecessary mystification, obscuring the reality of humanity and its physical actions shaping the world. He wrote that Hegelianism stood the movement of reality on its head, and that one needed to set it upon its feet. Despite his dislike of mystical terms, Marx used Gothic language in several of his works: in \"The Communist Manifesto\" he proclaims \"A spectre is haunting Europe—the spectre of communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre\", and in \"The Capital\" he refers to capital as \"necromancy that surrounds the products of labour\".\n\nThough inspired by French socialist and sociological thought, Marx criticised utopian socialists, arguing that their favoured small-scale socialistic communities would be bound to marginalisation and poverty and that only a large-scale change in the economic system can bring about real change.\n\nThe other important contributions to Marx's revision of Hegelianism came from Engels's book, \"The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844\", which led Marx to conceive of the historical dialectic in terms of class conflict and to see the modern working class as the most progressive force for revolution, as well as from the social democrat Friedrich Wilhelm Schulz, who in \"Die Bewegung der Produktion\" described the movement of society as \"flowing from the contradiction between the forces of production and the mode of production.\"\n\nMarx believed that he could study history and society scientifically and discern tendencies of history and the resulting outcome of social conflicts. Some followers of Marx therefore concluded that a communist revolution would inevitably occur. However, Marx famously asserted in the eleventh of his \"Theses on Feuerbach\" that \"philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point however is to change it\" and he clearly dedicated himself to trying to alter the world.\n\nMarx's polemic with other thinkers often occurred through critique and thus he has been called \"the first great user of critical method in social sciences\". He criticised speculative philosophy, equating metaphysics with ideology. By adopting this approach, Marx attempted to separate key findings from ideological biases. This set him apart from many contemporary philosophers.\n\nLike Tocqueville, who described a faceless and bureaucratic despotism with no identifiable despot, Marx also broke with classical thinkers who spoke of a single tyrant and with Montesquieu, who discussed the nature of the single despot. Instead, Marx set out to analyse \"the despotism of capital\". Fundamentally, Marx assumed that human history involves transforming human nature, which encompasses both human beings and material objects. Humans recognise that they possess both actual and potential selves. For both Marx and Hegel, self-development begins with an experience of internal alienation stemming from this recognition, followed by a realisation that the actual self, as a subjective agent, renders its potential counterpart an object to be apprehended. Marx further argues that by moulding nature in desired ways the subject takes the object as its own and thus permits the individual to be actualised as fully human. For Marx, the human nature—, or species-being—exists as a function of human labour. Fundamental to Marx's idea of meaningful labour is the proposition that in order for a subject to come to terms with its alienated object it must first exert influence upon literal, material objects in the subject's world. Marx acknowledges that Hegel \"grasps the nature of work and comprehends objective man, authentic because actual, as the result of his \", but characterises Hegelian self-development as unduly \"spiritual\" and abstract. Marx thus departs from Hegel by insisting that \"the fact that man is a corporeal, actual, sentient, objective being with natural capacities means that he has actual, sensuous objects for his nature as objects of his life-expression, or that he can only express his life in actual sensuous objects\". Consequently, Marx revises Hegelian \"work\" into material \"labour\" and in the context of human capacity to transform nature the term \"labour power\".\n\nMarx had a special concern with how people relate to their own labour power. He wrote extensively about this in terms of the problem of alienation. As with the dialectic, Marx began with a Hegelian notion of alienation but developed a more materialist conception. Capitalism mediates social relationships of production (such as among workers or between workers and capitalists) through commodities, including labour, that are bought and sold on the market. For Marx, the possibility that one may give up ownership of one's own labour—one's capacity to transform the world—is tantamount to being alienated from one's own nature and it is a spiritual loss. Marx described this loss as commodity fetishism, in which the things that people produce, commodities, appear to have a life and movement of their own to which humans and their behaviour merely adapt.\n\nCommodity fetishism provides an example of what Engels called \"false consciousness\", which relates closely to the understanding of ideology. By \"ideology\", Marx and Engels meant ideas that reflect the interests of a particular class at a particular time in history, but which contemporaries see as universal and eternal. Marx and Engels's point was not only that such beliefs are at best half-truths, as they serve an important political function. Put another way, the control that one class exercises over the means of production includes not only the production of food or manufactured goods, but also the production of ideas (this provides one possible explanation for why members of a subordinate class may hold ideas contrary to their own interests). An example of this sort of analysis is Marx's understanding of religion, summed up in a passage from the preface to his 1843 \"Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right\": \n\nWhereas his Gymnasium senior thesis at the argued that religion had as its primary social aim the promotion of solidarity, here Marx sees the social function of religion in terms of highlighting/preserving political and economic \"status quo\" and inequality.\n\nMarx was an outspoken opponent of child labour, saying that British industries \"could but live by sucking blood, and children’s blood too\", and that U.S. capital was financed by the \"capitalized blood of children\".\n\nMarx's thoughts on labour were related to the primacy he gave to the economic relation in determining the society's past, present and future (see also economic determinism). Accumulation of capital shapes the social system. For Marx, social change was about conflict between opposing interests, driven in the background by economic forces. This became the inspiration for the body of works known as the conflict theory. In his evolutionary model of history, he argued that human history began with free, productive and creative work that was over time coerced and dehumanised, a trend most apparent under capitalism. Marx noted that this was not an intentional process, rather no individual or even state can go against the forces of economy.\n\nThe organisation of society depends on means of production. The means of production are all things required to produce material goods, such as land, natural resources and technology but not human labor. The relations of production are the social relationships people enter into as they acquire and use the means of production. Together, these compose the mode of production and Marx distinguished historical eras in terms of modes of production. Marx differentiated between base and superstructure, where the base (or substructure) is the economic system and superstructure is the cultural and political system. Marx regarded this mismatch between economic base and social superstructure as a major source of social disruption and conflict.\n\nDespite Marx's stress on critique of capitalism and discussion of the new communist society that should replace it, his explicit critique is guarded, as he saw it as an improved society compared to the past ones (slavery and feudalism). Marx never clearly discusses issues of morality and justice, but scholars agree that his work contained implicit discussion of those concepts.\nMarx's view of capitalism was two-sided. On one hand, in the 19th century's deepest critique of the dehumanising aspects of this system he noted that defining features of capitalism include alienation, exploitation and recurring, cyclical depressions leading to mass unemployment. On the other hand, he characterized capitalism as \"revolutionising, industrialising and universalising qualities of development, growth and progressivity\" (by which Marx meant industrialisation, urbanisation, technological progress, increased productivity and growth, rationality and scientific revolution) that are responsible for progress. Marx considered the capitalist class to be one of the most revolutionary in history because it constantly improved the means of production, more so than any other class in history and was responsible for the overthrow of feudalism. Capitalism can stimulate considerable growth because the capitalist has an incentive to reinvest profits in new technologies and capital equipment.\n\nAccording to Marx, capitalists take advantage of the difference between the labour market and the market for whatever commodity the capitalist can produce. Marx observed that in practically every successful industry, input unit-costs are lower than output unit-prices. Marx called the difference \"surplus value\" and argued that it was based on surplus labour, the difference between what it costs to keep workers alive and what they can produce. Although Marx describes capitalists as vampires sucking worker's blood, he notes that drawing profit is \"by no means an injustice\" and that capitalists cannot go against the system. The problem is the \"cancerous cell\" of capital, understood not as property or equipment, but the relations between workers and owners—the economic system in general.\n\nAt the same time, Marx stressed that capitalism was unstable and prone to periodic crises. He suggested that over time capitalists would invest more and more in new technologies and less and less in labour. Since Marx believed that profit derived from surplus value appropriated from labour, he concluded that the rate of profit would fall as the economy grows. Marx believed that increasingly severe crises would punctuate this cycle of growth and collapse. Moreover, he believed that in the long-term, this process would enrich and empower the capitalist class and impoverish the proletariat. In section one of \"The Communist Manifesto\", Marx describes feudalism, capitalism and the role internal social contradictions play in the historical process:\n\nMarx believed that those structural contradictions within capitalism necessitate its end, giving way to socialism, or a post-capitalistic, communist society:\nThanks to various processes overseen by capitalism, such as urbanisation, the working class, the proletariat, should grow in numbers and develop class consciousness, in time realising that they can and must change the system. Marx believed that if the proletariat were to seize the means of production, they would encourage social relations that would benefit everyone equally, abolishing exploiting class and introduce a system of production less vulnerable to cyclical crises. Marx argued in \"The German Ideology\" that capitalism will end through the organised actions of an international working class: \n\nIn this new society, the alienation would end and humans would be free to act without being bound by the labour market. It would be a democratic society, enfranchising the entire population. In such a utopian world, there would also be little need for a state, whose goal was previously to enforce the alienation. Marx theorised that between capitalism and the establishment of a socialist/communist system, would exist a period of dictatorship of the proletariat—where the working class holds political power and forcibly socialises the means of production. As he wrote in his \"Critique of the Gotha Program\", \"between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat\". While he allowed for the possibility of peaceful transition in some countries with strong democratic institutional structures (such as Britain, the United States and the Netherlands), he suggested that in other countries in which workers cannot \"attain their goal by peaceful means\" the \"lever of our revolution must be force\".\n\nMarx viewed Russia as the main counter-revolutionary threat to European revolutions. During the Crimean War, Marx backed the Ottoman Empire and its allies Britain and France against Russia. He was absolutely opposed to Pan-Slavism, viewing it as an instrument of Russian foreign policy. Marx had considered the Slavic nations except Poles as 'counter-revolutionary'. Marx and Engels published in the \"Neue Rheinische Zeitung\" in February 1849:\n\nMarx and Engels sympathised with the Narodnik revolutionaries of the 1860s and 1870s. When the Russian revolutionaries assassinated Tsar Alexander II of Russia, Marx expressed the hope that the assassination foreshadowed ‘the formation of a Russian commune’. Marx supported the Polish uprisings against tsarist Russia. He said in a speech in London in 1867:\n\nMarx supported the cause of Irish independence. In 1867, he wrote Engels: \"I used to think the separation of Ireland from England impossible. I now think it inevitable. The English working class will never accomplish anything until it has got rid of Ireland. ... English reaction in England had its roots ... in the subjugation of Ireland.\"\n\nMarx spent some time in French Algeria, which had been invaded and made a French colony in 1830, and had opportunity to observe life in colonial North Africa. He wrote about the colonial justice system, in which \"a form of torture has been used (and this happens ‘regularly’) to extract confessions from the Arabs; naturally it is done (like the English in India) by the ‘police’; the judge is supposed to know nothing at all about it.\" Marx was surprised by the arrogance of many European settlers in Algiers and wrote in a letter: \"when a European colonist dwells among the ‘lesser breeds,’ either as a settler or even on business, he generally regards himself as even more inviolable than handsome William I [a Prussian king]. Still, when it comes to bare-faced arrogance and presumptuousness vis-à-vis the ‘lesser breeds,’ the British and Dutch outdo the French.\" \n\nAccording to the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\": \"Marx’s analysis of colonialism as a progressive force bringing modernization to a backward feudal society sounds like a transparent rationalization for foreign domination. His account of British domination, however, reflects the same ambivalence that he shows towards capitalism in Europe. In both cases, Marx recognizes the immense suffering brought about during the transition from feudal to bourgeois society while insisting that the transition is both necessary and ultimately progressive. He argues that the penetration of foreign commerce will cause a social revolution in India.\" \n\nMarx discussed British colonial rule in India in the \"New York Herald Tribune\" in June 1853: \n\nMarx's ideas have had a profound impact on world politics and intellectual thought. Followers of Marx have often debated amongst themselves over how to interpret Marx's writings and apply his concepts to the modern world. The legacy of Marx's thought has become contested between numerous tendencies, each of which sees itself as Marx's most accurate interpreter. In the political realm, these tendencies include Leninism, Marxism–Leninism, Trotskyism, Maoism, Luxemburgism and libertarian Marxism. Various currents have also developed in academic Marxism, often under influence of other views, resulting in structuralist Marxism, historical Marxism, phenomenological Marxism, analytical Marxism and Hegelian Marxism.\n\nFrom an academic perspective, Marx's work contributed to the birth of modern sociology. He has been cited as one of the 19th century's three masters of the \"school of suspicion\" alongside Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud and as one of the three principal architects of modern social science along with Émile Durkheim and Max Weber. In contrast to other philosophers, Marx offered theories that could often be tested with the scientific method. Both Marx and Auguste Comte set out to develop scientifically justified ideologies in the wake of European secularisation and new developments in the philosophies of history and science. Working in the Hegelian tradition, Marx rejected Comtean sociological positivism in attempt to develop a \"science of society\". Karl Löwith considered Marx and Søren Kierkegaard to be the two greatest Hegelian philosophical successors. In modern sociological theory, Marxist sociology is recognised as one of the main classical perspectives. Isaiah Berlin considers Marx the true founder of modern sociology \"in so far as anyone can claim the title\". Beyond social science, he has also had a lasting legacy in philosophy, literature, the arts and the humanities.\n\nSocial theorists of the 20th and 21st centuries have pursued two main strategies in response to Marx. One move has been to reduce it to its analytical core, known as analytical Marxism. Another, more common, move has been to dilute the explanatory claims of Marx's social theory and emphasise the \"relative autonomy\" of aspects of social and economic life not directly related to Marx's central narrative of interaction between the development of the \"forces of production\" and the succession of \"modes of production\". Such has been for example the neo-Marxist theorising adopted by historians inspired by Marx's social theory, such as E. P. Thompson and Eric Hobsbawm. It has also been a line of thinking pursued by thinkers and activists like Antonio Gramsci who have sought to understand the opportunities and the difficulties of transformative political practice, seen in the light of Marxist social theory. Marx's ideas would also have a profound influence on subsequent artists and art history, with avant-garde movements across literature, visual art, music, film and theater.\n\nPolitically, Marx's legacy is more complex. Throughout the 20th century, revolutions in dozens of countries labelled themselves \"Marxist\"most notably the Russian Revolution, which led to the founding of the Soviet Union. Major world leaders including Vladimir Lenin, Mao Zedong, Fidel Castro, Salvador Allende, Josip Broz Tito, Kwame Nkrumah, Jawaharlal Nehru, Nelson Mandela, Xi Jinping, Jean-Claude Juncker and Thomas Sankara all cited Marx as an influence. Beyond where Marxist revolutions took place, Marx's ideas informed political parties worldwide. In countries associated with some Marxist claims have led political opponents to blame Marx for millions of deaths, but the fidelity of these varied revolutionaries, leaders and parties to Marx's work is highly contested and rejected by many Marxists. It is now common to distinguish between the legacy and influence of Marx specifically and the legacy and influence of those who shaped his ideas for political purposes.\n\nTwo centuries after his birth Marx remains both controversial and relevant, as the unveiling of a 4.5m statue of him (given by China, sculpted by Wu Weishan) in his birthplace of Trier, Germany in 2018 demonstrates. In 2017 a feature film, \"The Young Karl Marx\", featuring Marx, his wife Jenny Marx, and his collaborator Friedrich Engels, among other revolutionaries and intellectuals prior to the revolutions of 1848 received good reviews both for its historical accuracy and its brio in treating the intellectual life. \n\nIn May 2018, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker attended the event in Karl Marx's hometown of Trier, Germany, at which a statue of Marx, donated by the Chinese government, was unveiled. Juncker defended Marx, saying that \"Karl Marx was a philosopher, who thought into the future, had creative aspirations, and today he stands for things, which is he not responsible for and which he didn't cause, because many of the things he wrote down were redrafted into the opposite.\"\n\nThere are many other postage stamps; at least 22 countries issued postage stamps in his honor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The painting was begun in 1534 for the funerary chapel of Francesco Tagliaferri in Parma, but remained incomplete on Parmigianino's death in 1540. Ferdinando de' Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany, purchased it in 1698 and it has been on display at the Uffizi since 1948.\n\nThe painting depicts the Virgin Mary seated on a high pedestal in luxurious robes, holding a rather large baby Jesus on her lap. \nSix angels crowded together on the Madonna's right adore the Christ-child. \n\nIn the lower right-hand corner of the painting is an enigmatic scene, with a row of marble columns and the emaciated figure of St. Jerome. A depiction of St. Jerome was required by the commissioner because of the saint's connection with the adoration of the Virgin Mary. \n\nThe painting is popularly called \"Madonna of the Long Neck\" because \"the painter, in his eagerness to make the Holy Virgin look graceful and elegant, has given her a neck like that of a swan.\" On the unusual arrangement of figures, Austrian-British art historian E. H. Gombrich writes:\n\nParmigianino has distorted nature for his own artistic purposes, creating a typical Mannerist figura serpentinata. Jesus is also extremely large for a baby, and he lies precariously on Mary's lap as if about to fall at any moment. The Madonna herself is of hardly human proportions—she is almost twice the size of the angels to her right. Her right foot rests on cushions that appear to be only a few inches away from the picture plane, but the foot itself seems to project beyond it, and is thus on \"our\" side of the canvas, breaking the conventions of a framed picture. Her slender hands and long fingers have also led the Italian medical scientist Vito Franco of the University of Palermo to diagnose that Parmigianino's model had the genetic disorder Marfan syndrome affecting her connective tissue.\n\nFollowing a recent restoration of the painting, the unfinished face of an angel just below the Madonna's right elbow can be seen more clearly. Also the angel in the middle of the bottom row now looks at the vase held by the angel on his right, in which can be seen the faint image of a cross. Before the restoration this angel looked down at the Christ child. The changes made during the restoration likely reflect the original painting, which must have been altered at some time in its history. The angel who faces the viewer has a resemblance to Parmigianino's \"Antea\" portrait.\n"}

In 1933 it was claimed she was one of only five female film directors in the world.\n\nAt one stage they had offers to go to Hollywood. \"Fox Films offered to send us,\" said Phyllis McDonagh, \"But we were sensible girls. We sat down and talked and decided we would end up very small fish in a big pond. At home we had work and a reputation.\"\n\nPaulette McDangh was born on 11 June 1901 in Sydney and one of seven children born to Annie Jane (Anita) Amora and John Michael McDonagh.\n\nShe was educated at the Catholic Kincoppal School in Rose Bay, Sydney.\n\nShe collaborated alongside her sisters Isabel and Phyllis to create and produce films. They were business partners, working together in the Australian film industry during the 1920s and 1930s. Paulette, was the youngest, and known to be the writer and director of their films while Phyllis acted as publisher and promoter, and Isabel was the star actress. Growing up in a bohemian and wealthy family, their home was a lavish back drop for most of their films, filled with antique furniture and rich colors.\n\nTheir first silent film, \"Those Who Love\" (1926), was funded privately by their family. Paulette took over the position of directing the screenplay when creative differences with P.J. Ramster broke out. The sisters' risk taking attempt at film making paid off when the publication, \"Everyone's\", gave them a rave review, stating:\nThe result is a dazzling triumph and which is said to be the best Australian film that has yet graced the screen. A Sydney girl whose histrionic ability is remarkable. Her splendid performance ranks with some of the best characterizations ever given to the screen by the world’s greatest stars.\nIn the wake of the financial success of \"Those Who Love\", the McDonagh sisters followed up with further silent films including \"The Far Paradise\" (1928), and \"The Cheaters\" (1930).\n\n\"The Far Paradise\" was a box office hit and acclaimed for its fine art techniques that were influenced not just by Australian film, but also Hollywood melodrama and German expressionism.\n\nThe melodramatic influences allowed for overacting on Isabel’s part while Phyllis and Paulette were able to create longer screen time for her to perform on her own. Isabel acted as a more interesting heroine than was common in most films of its time. Paulette the director had Isabel acting in different situations such as breaking and entering, cracking safes, and even in the arms of a lover. During this time period it was outside of the norm to show a woman on screen performing such roles, but this gave their silent films depth and a following of a greater and more appreciative crowd.\n\nDespite their small budget, the sisters, and especially Paulette, were able to create society melodramas involving romance, sacrifice, and parental opposition.\n\nWhen Isabel and Phyllis retired from the film industry for various reasons, Paulette found it difficult to continue her work alone despite her efforts to persevere. In 1934 she took a job to work on a romantic epic based on the life of the Reverend John Flynn. With a budgetary shortfall and having no one to act or produce the film, Paulette was forced to drop the job.\n\nWith her film career ending, she continued to live with her younger siblings. Paulette died in Sydney on 30 August 1978.\n\n\n"}

When the Pleiades rise from the east with the sun, it means the cold and rainy season is coming, and thus one does well to prepare for the cold.\n\nIn the Bible, the Pleiades are mentioned as כימה (\"Khima\") three times, always in conjunction with Orion—Amos 5:8; Job 9:9; and Job 38:31. The first two verses are references about their creation, but the third (taken in the context of the following verses) may be more about their ongoing appearance in the night sky. In Job 38:31, the Lord is speaking directly to Job and challenges him, asking if he can bind the chains of the Pleiades—the implication being that Job cannot, but the Lord can. Talmud (Bavli, Berakhot, 58b) says that it has about 100 stars, understanding the word כימה as כמאה \"ke' me-ah,\" \"about one hundred\" in Hebrew.\n\nThey are known as kimah in Jewish culture.\n\nLike most other astronomical findings in the Talmud, rabbinic tradition claims to have gotten such knowledge from Moses when he descended down from Mount Sinai, and hence, from God Himself.\n\nRabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki (\"Rashi\", 1040-1105), suggested that there were even more stars within the Pleiades Cluster when he expanded on the Talmud's question, \"What is meant by Kimah?” which is understood by the modern Orthodox community to mean that there are more than a hundred stars. Therefore, Rashi was saying that the passage in the Talmud only mentioned the most important stars, this numbering to about a hundred, while leaving out the less important ones (which could be hundreds more).\n\nAmazingly, the Pleiades are at max, 500 light years away, and here were the rabbis, commenting on the number of stars where other cultures could only detect 6-7.\n\nIn Arabic the Pleiades are known as \"al-Thurayya\" الثريا, and mentioned in Islamic literature. Muhammad is noted to have counted twelve stars in the constellation as reported in Ibn Ishaq (this was in the time before telescopes when most could only see six).\nThe name was borrowed into Persian and Turkish as a female given name, and is in use throughout the Middle East (for example Princess Soraya of Iran and Thoraya Obaid). It is also the name of the Thuraya satellite phone system based in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nMuhammad made mention of the Pleiades. A Hadith recalled by Imam Bukhari, states:\n\n\"*The chapter talked about above is Chapter 62 - Surah Al-Jummah - from the Qur'an.\"\n\n\"**The verse quoted here is verse 3 from the aforementioned chapter.\"\n\nIn Turkish the Pleiades are known as \"Ülker\". According to the Middle Turkic lexicographer Kaşgarlı Mahmud, writing in the 11th century, \"ülker çerig\" refers to a military ambush (\"çerig\" meaning 'troops in battle formation'): \"The army is broken up into detachments posted in various places,\" and when one detachment falls back the others follow after it, and by this device \"(the enemy) is often routed.\" Thus \"ülker çerig\" literally means 'an army made up of a group of detachments', which forms an apt simile for a star cluster. Ülker is also a unisex given name, a surname and the name of a food company best known for its chocolates.\n\nIn the Persian language Pleiades is known as \"Parvin\". Parvin is also a very popular given name in Iran and neighbouring countries (for example Parvin E'tesami).\n\nThe word has acquired a meaning of \"multitude\", inspiring the name of the French literary movement La Pléiade and an earlier group of Alexandrian poets, the Alexandrian Pleiad.\n\nIn Greek mythology, the stars of Pleiades represented the Seven Sisters.\n\nTo the Vikings, the Pleiades were Freyja's hens, and their name in many old European languages such as Hungarian compares them to a hen with chicks.\n\nThe astrological Pleiades were described in \"Three Books of Occult Philosophy\" by Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa (Köln, 1533, but published manuscript as early as 1510).\n\nIn Western astrology they represent coping with sorrow and were considered a single one of the medieval fixed stars. As such, they are associated with quartz and fennel.\n\nIn esoteric astrology the seven solar systems revolve around Pleiades.\n\nTo the Bronze Age people of Europe, such as the Celts (and probably considerably earlier), the Pleiades were associated with mourning and with funerals, since at that time in history, on the cross-quarter day between the autumn equinox and the winter solstice (see Samhain, also Halloween or All Souls Day), which was a festival devoted to the remembrance of the dead, the cluster rose in the eastern sky as the sun's light faded in the evening. It was from this acronychal rising that the Pleiades became associated with tears and mourning. As a result of precession over the centuries, the Pleiades no longer marked the festival, but the association has nevertheless persisted, and may account for the significance of the Pleiades astrologically.\n\nIn Baltic languages the name for this constellation is Sietynas in Lithuanian and Sietiņš in Latvian which is derived from \"sietas\" meaning \"a sieve\". In Lithuanian folk songs this constellation is often personified as a benevolent brother who helps orphan girls to marry or walks soldiers along the fields. But in Lithuanian folk tales as well as Latvian folk songs this constellation is usually depicted as an inanimate object, a sieve which gets stolen by the devil from the thunder god or is used to conjure light rain by thunder's wife and children.\n\nIn Ukrainian traditional folklore the Pleiades are known as Стожари (Stozhary), Волосожари (Volosozhary), or Баби-Звізди (Baby-Zvizdy).\n\n'Stozhary' can be etymologically traced to \"стожарня\" (stozharnya) meaning a 'granary', 'storehouse for hay and crops', or can also be reduced to the root \"сто-жар\", (sto-zhar) meaning 'hundredfold glowing' or \"a hundred embers\".\n\n'Volosozhary' (the ones whose hair is glowing), or 'Baby-Zvizdy' (female-stars) refer to the female tribal deities. According to the legend, seven maids lived long ago. They used to dance the traditional round dances and sing the glorious songs to honor the gods. After their death the gods turned them into water nymphs, and, having taken them to the Heavens, settled them upon the seven stars, where they dance their round dances (symbolic for moving the time) to this day. (see article in Ukrainian Wikipedia)\n\nIn Ukraine this asterism was considered a female talisman until recent times.\n\nThe old name of the starcluster in Hungarian is \"Fiastyúk\", meaning 'a hen with chicks'. There is also a version of the story popularized by the song \"A Nap és Szép háza\" (House of Sun and Wind) of Hungarian folk metal band Dalriada speaking of a poor woman with seven sons who cursed her sons to turn into ravens after the sons wasted their only food. She failed to find them, but received a prophecy that an eighth brother could find the sons. Her eighth son thus went to look for his brothers, died and the brothers as ravens came to feast on his carcass, resulting in them dying as well and the eight of them getting a place in the sky as the Pleiades cluster. \n\nIt was common among the indigenous peoples of the Americas to measure keenness of vision by the number of stars the viewer could see in the Pleiades, a practice which was also used in historical Europe, especially in Greece.\n\nIn the ancient Andes, the Pleiades were associated with abundance, because they return to the Southern Hemisphere sky each year at harvest-time. In Quechua they are called \"Qullqa\" (storehouse).\n\nThe ancient Aztecs of Mexico and Central America based their calendar upon the Pleiades. Their year began when priests first remarked the asterism heliacal rising in the east, immediately before the sun's dawn light obliterated the view of the stars. Aztecs called the Pleiades Tianquiztli (meaning \"marketplace\").\n\nPaul Goble, Native American storyteller, tells a Blackfoot legend that he says is told by other tribes as well. In the story, the Pleiades are orphans (\"Lost Boys\") that were not cared for by the people, so they became stars. Sun Man is angered by the mistreatment of the children and punishes the people with a draught, causing the buffalo to disappear, until the dogs, the only friends of the orphans, intercede on behalf of the people. Because the buffalo are not available while the Lost Boys are in the skies, the cosmical setting of the Pleaides was an assembly signal for Blackfoot hunter to travel to their hunting grounds to conduct the large-scale hunts, culminating in slaughters at buffalo jumps, that characterized their culture.\n\nA Cherokee myth (similar to that of the Onondaga people) indicates that seven boys who would not do their ceremonial chores and wanted only to play, ran around and around the ceremonial ball court in a circle, and rose up into the sky. Only six of the boys made it to the sky; the seventh was caught by his mother and fell to the ground with such force that he sank into the ground. A pine tree grew over his resting place.\n\nA Cheyenne myth \"The Girl Who Married a Dog\", states that the group of seven stars known as the Pleiades originated from seven puppies which a Cheyenne chief's daughter gave birth to after mysteriously being visited by a dog in human form to whom she vowed \"Wherever you go, I go\".\n\nThe Hopi had a relatively limited star lore, but determined the passage of time for nighttime rituals in the winter by observing the Pleiades (\"Tsöösöqam\") and Orion through a kiva entrance hatch as they passed overhead. The Pleiades were depicted in a mural on one kiva wall.\n\nThe Lakota Tribe of North America had a legend that linked the origin of the Pleiades to Devils Tower. According to the Seris (of northwestern Mexico), these stars are seven women who are giving birth. The constellation is known as \"Cmaamc\", which is apparently an archaic plural of the noun \"cmaam\" \"woman\".\n\nThe Monache people tell of six wives who loved onions more than their husbands and now live happily in \"sky country\".\n\nThe early Monte Alto Culture, and others in Guatemala such as Ujuxte and Takalik Abaj, made their early observatories using the Pleiades and \"Eta Draconis\" as reference; they were called \"the seven sisters\", and thought to be their original land.\n\nA Nez Perce myth about this constellation mirrors the ancient Greek myths about the Lost Pleiades. In the Nez Perce version the Pleiades is also a group of sisters, however the story itself is somewhat different. One sister falls in love with a man and, following his death, is so absorbed by her own grief that she tells her sisters about him. They mock her and tell her how silly it is of her to feel sad for the human after his death, and she in return keeps her growing sadness to herself, eventually becoming so ashamed and miserable about her own feelings that she pulls the sky over her face like a veil, blocking herself from view. This myth explains why there are only six of the seven stars visible to the naked eye.\n\nThe Pleiades (\"dilγéhé\") play a major role in Navajo folklore and ritual. In the Navajo creation story, Upward-reachingway, \"dilγéhé\" was the first constellation placed in the sky by Black God. When Black God entered the hogan of creation, the Pleiades were on his ankle; he stamped his foot and they moved to his knee, then to his ankle, then to his shoulder, and finally to his left temple. The seven stars of \"dilγéhé\" are depicted on ceremonial masks of Black God, in sand paintings and on ceremonial gourd rattles.\n\nThe Onondaga people's version of the story has lazy children who prefer to dance over their daily chores ignoring the warnings of the Bright Shining Old Man.\n\nThe Skidi Pawnee consider the Pleiades to be seven brothers. They observed the seven brothers, as well as Corona Borealis, the Chiefs, through the smoke hole of Pawnee lodges to determine the time of night.\n\nThe Shasta people tell a story of the children of racoon killed by coyote avenging their father's death and then rising into the sky to form the Pleiades. The smallest star in the cluster is said to be coyote's youngest who aided the young racoons.\n\nAmong the Ban Raji people, who live in semi-nomadic settlements scattered throughout western Nepal and northern India, the Pleiades are called the \"Seven sisters-in-law and one brother-in-law\" (\"Hatai halyou daa salla\"). Ban Rajis note that when the Pleiades rises up over the mountain each night, they feel happy to see their ancient kin (Fortier 2008: in press). On a more practical note, Ban Rajis can tell that evening has arrived, indicating that it is about eight o'clock by local time standards when their star-kin rise above the Nepali mountains bordering the Kali River.\n\nIn Chinese constellations they are 昴 \"mao\", the \"Hairy Head\" of the white tiger of the West.\n\nIn Indian astrology the Pleiades were known as the nakshatra which in Sanskrit is translated as \"the cutters\". The Pleiades are called the \"star of fire,\" and their ruling deity is the fire god Agni. It is one of the most prominent of the nakshatra, and is associated with anger and stubbornness. Karthigai (கார்த்திகை) in Tamil refers to the six wives of the six rishi (sages), the seventh being Arundhati the wife of Vasistha which relates to the star Alcor in Ursa Major. The six stars in Pleiades correspond to six wives, while the faithful wife Arundhati stuck with Sage Vasistha in Ursa Major. The six wives fell in love with Agni, hence the name Pleiades (star of fire).\n\nIn the island of Java, the asterism is known in Javanese as \"Lintang Kartika\" or \"Gugus Kartika\" (\"Kartika cluster\"), a direct influence from the ancient Hindu Javanese. Influenced by Hinduism, the stars represent the seven princesses, which is represented in the court dance of Bedhaya Ketawang of the royal palaces of Surakarta. The dance is performed once per year, on the second day of the Javanese month of Ruwah (during May) and is performed by the nine females, relatives or wives of the Susuhunan (prince) of Surakarta before a private audience in the inner circle of the Sultanate family. Another name for Pleiades in Java is \"Wuluh\".\n\nIn northern Java, its rising marks the arrival of the \"mangsa kapitu\" (\"seventh season\"), which marks the beginning of rice planting season.\n\nIn Japan, the Pleiades are known as 昴 \"Subaru\" which means \"coming together\" or cluster in Japanese, and have given their name to the car manufacturer whose logo incorporates six stars to represent the five companies that merged into one. Subaru Telescope, located in Mauna Kea Observatory on Hawaii, is also named after the Pleiades.\n\nIn Thailand the Pleiades are known as (ดาวลูกไก่) or the \"Chick Stars\", from a Thai folk tale. The story tells that a poor elderly couple who lived in a forest had raised a family of chickens: a mother hen and her six (or alternately seven) chicks. One day a monk arrived at the couple's home during his Dhutanga journey. Worried that they had no suitable food to offer him, the elderly couple contemplated cooking the mother hen. The hen overheard the conversation, and rushed back to the coop to say farewell to her children. She told them to take care of themselves, and that her death would repay the kindness of the elderly couple, who had taken care of all of them for so long. As the mother hen's feathers were being burned over a fire, the chicks threw themselves into fire in order to die along with their mother. The deity, impressed by and in remembrance of their love, immortalized the seven chickens as the stars of the Pleiades. In tellings of the story in which there were only six chicks, the mother is included, but often includes only the seven chicks.\n\nDepending on the language group or clan, there are several Aboriginal stories regarding the origins of the Pleiades. Some Indigenous Australian peoples believed the Pleiades was a woman who had been nearly raped by Kidili, the man in the moon.\n\nIn a legend told by the Wurundjeri people of south-eastern Australia, the Pleiades were represented by the seven Karatgurk sisters. These women were the first to possess the secret of fire and each one carried live coals on the end of her digging stick. Although they refused to share these coals with anybody, they were ultimately tricked into giving up their secret by Crow, who subsequently brought fire to mankind. After this, the Karatgurk sisters were swept into the night sky. Their glowing fire sticks became the bright stars of the Pleiades cluster.\n\nAnother version, often painted by Gabriella Possum Nungurayyi as this is her dreaming (or creation story), daughter of the late Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri from the Central desert art movement of Papunya, depicts the story of seven Napaltjarri sisters being chased by a man named Jilbi Tjakamarra. He tried to practice love magic on one of the sisters but the sister did not want to be with him, and ran away from him together with her sisters. They sat down at Uluru to search for honey ants but when they saw Jilbi, they went to Kurlunyalimpa and with the spirits of Uluru, transformed into stars. Jilbi transforms himself into what is commonly known as the Morning Star in Orion's belt , thus continuing to chase the seven sisters across the sky.\n\nThere is an analogous holiday in Hawaiʻi known as Makahiki.\n\nOccurring June 20 – June 22, the winter solstice (\"Te Maruaroa o Takurua\") is seen by the New Zealand Māori as the middle of the winter season. It follows directly after the first sighting of \"Matariki\" (The Pleiades) and \"Puanga/Puaka\" (Rigel) in the dawn sky, an event which marked the beginning of the New Year and was said to be when the Sun turned from his northern journey with his winter-bride \"Takurua\" (Sirius) and began his journey back to his summer-bride \"Hine Raumati\".\n\nIn the Swahili language of East Africa they are called \"kilimia\" (Proto-Bantu *ki-dimida in Bantu areas E, F, G, J, L, and S) which comes from the verb \"-lima\" meaning \"dig\" or \"cultivate\" as their visibility was taken as a sign to prepare digging as the onset of the rain was near.\n\nIn the closely related Sesotho language of the Southern Africa's Basotho people the Pleiades are called \"Seleme se setshehadi\" (\"the female planter\"). Its disappearance in April (the 10th month) and the appearance of the star Achernar signals the beginning of the cold season. Like many other Southern African cultures, Basotho associate its visibility with agriculture and plenty.\n\nThe 19th century astronomer Johann Heinrich von Mädler proposed the Central Sun Hypothesis, according to which all stars revolve around the star Alcyone, in the Pleiades. Based on this hypothesis, the Jehovah's Witnesses religion taught until the 1950s that Alcyone was likely to be the site of the throne of God.\n\nIn Theosophy, it is believed the \"Seven Stars of the Pleiades\" focus the spiritual energy of the Seven Rays from the \"Galactic Logos\" to the \"Seven Stars of the Great Bear\", then to Sirius, then to the Sun, then to the god of Earth (Sanat Kumara) and finally through the seven Masters of the Seven Rays to us.\n\nIn Ufology some believers describe Nordic alien extraterrestrials (called Pleiadeans) as originating from this system.\n\nIn New Age lore, some believe that Sun and the Earth will pass through a Photon belt from the Pleiades, causing a cataclysm and/or initiating a spiritual transition (referred to variously as a \"shift in consciousness,\" the \"Great Shift,\" the \"Shift of the Ages\").\n\nBarbara Marciniak, author of \"Bringers of the Dawn\", is one of the authors who contributes to the New Age mythos of Pleiadian ET beings who are linked to human ancestry.\n\n"}

{"id": "17249385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17249385", "title": "Rock art of the Chumash people", "text": "Rock art of the Chumash people\n\nChumash rock art is a genre of paintings on caves, mountains, cliffs, or other living rock surfaces, created by the Chumash people of southern California. Pictographs and petroglyphs are common through interior California, the rock painting tradition thrived until the 19th century. Chumash rock art is considered to be some of the most elaborate rock art tradition in the region.\n\nThe Chumash are probably best known for the pictographs. Which were brightly colored paintings of humans, animals, and abstract circles. They were thought to be part of a religious ritual.\n\nThe Chumash lived in the present-day counties of Santa Barbara, Ventura, and San Luis Obispo in southern California for 14,000 years. They were a maritime, hunter-gatherer society whose livelihood was based on the sea. They developed excellent skills for catching fish, shellfish, and other marine mammals. Beyond fishing, however, they were also skilled in creating rock art. Hudson and Blackburn define rock art as \"an aesthetic, symbolic representation of significant concepts and entities that is painted on or carved into a rock surface.\" Rock art may have been created by shamans during vision quests, most commonly in the form of pictographs (paintings on rock), but sometimes petroglyphs (engravings on rock) as well. No one is absolutely certain about the meaning of the Chumash Rock art, but scholars generally agree that it is connected with religion and astronomy.\n\nChumash rock art is almost invariably found in caves or on cliffs in the mountains, although some small, portable painted rocks have been recorded by Campbell Grant. The rock art sites are always found near streams, springs, or some other source of permanent water. In his research of southern California rock art, Grant recorded numerous sites from different areas that were all close to a water source. He found twelve painted sites in the highest parts of the mountainous Chumash territory, the Ventureño area. The Ventura and Santa Clara Rivers and several coastal streams flow through this area. He also recorded forty-one painted rock art sites in the Cuyama Valley region (north of the Ventureño area), where the Sisquoc River flows between the San Rafael Mountains and the Sierra Madre Mountains. The most easily accessible example is at Painted Cave State Historic Park, which is located in canyons above Santa Barbara.\nPainted Rock is a free-standing rock on the Carrizo Plain near the Sierra Madre Mountains at the southern tip of the Great Central Valley. The interior alcove of the horseshoe-shaped rock features pictographs by Chumash, neighboring tribes, and non-Native Americans. \n\nThe Burro Flats Painted Cave petroglyphs are located in the Simi Hills in Ventura County. They are on the private land of Rocketdyne's Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL), which has protected them from public harm since 1947. The SSFL is closed and in the initial stage of a significant toxins and radionuclides site investigation and cleanup. Boeing, U.S. DOE, and NASA (current property owners and responsible parties) and the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) are responsible to protect Chumash and other historical elements during the extensive SSFL work.\n\nChumash traditional narratives in oral history say that religious specialists, known as \"'alchuklash\" created the rock art. Non-Chumash people call these practitioners medicine men or shamans. \nAccording to David Whitley, shamanism is \"a form of worship based on direct, personal interaction between a shaman (or medicine man) and the supernatural (or sacred realm and its spirits).\" In Chumash territory, the sites for the vision quests were usually located near the shaman's village. The Chumash considered caves, rocks, and water sources quite powerful, and the shamans saw them as a \"portal to the sacred realm...where they could enter the supernatural.\" The way a shaman interacted with the supernatural was by entering a hallucinogenic trance, or altered state of consciousness. In this altered state, brought on either by surprisingly potent native tobacco or jimsonweed, shamans received visions and supernatural power from spirit helpers often in the forms of dangerous and powerful animals like rattlesnakes and grizzly bears. Spirit helpers almost never took the form of an animal that was an important source of food, because it was 'taboo for a shaman to eat meat from the species of his helper.'\n\nChumash rock art depicts images like humans, animals, celestial bodies, and other (at times ambiguous) shapes and patterns. These depictions vary considerably and appear to be in no particular order or arrangement. The colors of the paintings vary as well, from red or black monochromes (different shades of a single color) to elaborate polychromes (many various colors). The Chumash made paint from a mixture of mineralized soil, stone mortar, and some kind of liquid binder like blood or oil from animals or mashed seeds. The addition of an oil binder helped to make the paint permanent and waterproof. Orange and red paint contained hematite or iron oxide, while yellow came from limonite, blue and green from copper or serpentine, white from kaolin clays or gypsum, and black from manganese or charcoal. Paint was applied with a person's finger or a brush. Grant organized the types of images depicted in the paintings into two categories: representational and abstract. Representational images include squares, circles and triangles, zigzags, crisscrosses, parallel lines, and pinwheels. Grant noted that in settled villages, abstract paintings were prominent, while the areas occupied by bands of hunting people reveal representational images.\n\nIn the early 20th century, non-Natives began studying California rock art, including a number of archaeologists, such as Julian Steward and Alfred Kroeber. Because of some commonly occurring symbols in paintings, it was believed that at least portions of the rock art depicted themes of fertility, water, and rain; however, the Native California Indians are very reluctant to talk to anyone about the rock art and some deny any knowledge of it altogether. The natives' hesitancy to discuss the art led archaeologists to believe that they had no idea of the origin of the pictographs. Kroeber recorded some of his thoughts on the origins of the rock art in 1925.\n\n\"The cave paintings of [Southern California]...represent a particular art, or local style or cult. This can be connected, in all probability, with the technological art of the Chumash. [An] association with...religion is also to be considered, although nothing positive is known in the matter. Many of the pictures may have been made by shamans; and it is quite possible that medicine men were not connected with the making of any.\"\n\nKroeber was unsure about what specific associations could be made between the paintings and the artists. Julian Steward researched California rock art as well, and in 1929 he deduced that the only way to understand the meanings of the petroglyphs and pictographs was to compare them with the art and symbolism of the different Indian groups and their respective culture areas. In his book \"Petroglyphs of California\", Steward wrote: \n\"It has frequently been stated that the petroglyphs and pictographs are meaningless figures made in idle moments by some primitive artist. The facts of distribution, however, show that this cannot be true. Since design elements and style are grouped in limited areas, the primitive artist must have made the inscriptions with something in mind. ... He executed, not random drawings, but figures similar to those made in other parts of the same area.\"\n\nAt Painted Cave, a circle enclosing five spokes surrounded by other circles–some spoked, some rayed–is thought to represent the solar eclipse of November 24, 1677. Pinwheel shapes, dots, and concentric circles are believed to be celestial bodies. Figures combining human and animal features represent states of transformation the \"'alchuklash\" experienced. Certain animals, such as rattlesnakes and frogs, are believed to represent spirit helpers.\n\nIn 2006, an arborglyph on an oak tree in the Santa Lucia Range in San Luis Obispo County was discovered to be Chumash art. The tree, locally known as the \"scorpion tree,\" was originally believed to have been the work of cowboys. However, archaeologists believe it to be the only known Native American arborglyph in the western United States. The work on the tree is theorized to be correlated to the movement of celestial bodies. If true, it would demonstrate that Chumash art was likely used as astronomical calendars.\n\nConcerning the age of the paintings, Grant says \"a radiocarbon test on pigment from a Santa Barbara area pictograph site showed that the sample was 'not over 2,000 years old.'\"\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18494716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18494716", "title": "San Baudelio de Berlanga", "text": "San Baudelio de Berlanga\n\nThe Hermitage of San Baudelio de Berlanga (\"Ermita de San Baudelio de Berlanga\") is an early 11th-century church at Caltojar in the province of Soria, Castile and León, Spain, 80 km south of Berlanga de Duero. It is an important example of Mozarabic architecture for its peculiarities, and was built in the 11th century, in what was then the frontier between Islamic and Christian lands. It is dedicated to Saint Baudilus or Baudel.\n\nThe construction of the hermitage is part of the period of the definitive consolidation of the Christian kingdoms throughout this area, which takes place around the year 1060, when the taking takes place, by Ferdinand I of León, of several towns including Berlanga.\n\nDeclared a national monument in 1917, The Hermitage of San Baudelio de Berlanga is thought to have been built to honor Saint Baudilus, or San Baudelio as he is known in Spanish. Saint Baudilus was a monk who lived during the second or third century in Nîmes and is mentioned in two twelfth-century documents.\n\nLegends about Saint Baudilus say that he earned the crown of martyrdom after preaching the gospel to local townspeople celebrating the birth of Jupiter, and that after his execution by decapitation with an axe, wells sprang up at the location of his death. It is unknown what direct connection San Baudelio had with this chapel made in his honor, if any, though the movement of the cult of San Baudelio into Spain was probably responsible for its creation. Saint Baudilus died in the late third or fourth century.\n\nA small adjoining cave is still accessible inside the southwestern wall of the sanctuary, where a hermit may have lived at one point, and locals still make pilgrimage to a freshwater spring near the church each year on May 20 (his feast day) to pay respects to Saint Baudilus, who also had miraculous cures named after him in earlier centuries. An axe and a palm tree are the symbols of his martyrdom, and the palm can be seen as a direct inspiration to the unique architecture of San Baudelio de Berlanga.\n\nIn the tenth century as the power of the Moors was diminishing in the North, it is probable that a hermit monk took refuge in the lonely cave in the Spanish countryside. His status could have drawn visitors with offerings and companionship, which may have been the catalyst for the building of the hermitage church. At the approximate time of the building of the chapel, local craftsmen, mostly from Castile, would have been Mozarabs. This would account for the heavy Mozarabic influence on the architecture. Also, San Baudelio closely correlates with a church pictured in the Codex Vigilanus (A. D. 976), approximating the construction of the hermitage to the late tenth or early eleventh century.\n\nOne of the most remarkable aspects is its pictorial decoration, as it is one of the important examples of Romanesque painting in Spain. Only a few remains of tempera painting remain, since the originals were torn and exported in 1926 to different museums of the United States. (Cincinnati Museum of Art, New York Cloisters Museum, Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the Indianapolis Museum of Art). Some are also in the Prado Museum, specifically six scenes. Of the paintings that came out to United States we have: The Dromedary, The healing of the blind and The resurrection of Lazarus, The Temptation of Christ, The three Marys before the tomb, The Holy Supper, The wedding of Cana, Entrance to Jerusalem and the Falconer. In 1957 the Spanish government exchanged some of these paintings for the Fuentidueña Apse of the Romanesque church of San Martín of the Castilian town of Fuentidueña, which today is preserved in the Metropolitan Museum of New York, the paintings thus acquired were deposited in the Prado Museum. Among those found in Spain we have: Hunt deer, Hare hunting, The warrior, The elephant, The bear and The hunter. In 1965 the works of restoration of the paintings that were still in the church and that had not been removed were carried out.\n\nNo records provide evidence of the construction of the church, but it is apparent that it belongs to the group of Mozarabic churches built throughout northern Spain during the tenth and eleventh centuries. San Baudelio sets itself apart from the rest of the architecture in the Castile region because it is an uncommon example of the Mozarabic style, rather than the much more numerous examples of Moorish influenced architecture from Andalusia, which are found farther west in León.\n\nThe lack of information on the church force it to be dated based on its architectural influences and construction, as well as through the paintings that once lined the interior of the small chapel.\n\nSan Baudelio de Berlanga is a relatively plain building on the outside, being mostly square with a small, nearly square apse adjoining its east side. The walls of the entire structure are made of rough native stone, and its exterior offers no decoration whatsoever. The interior, however, is very distinctive, and has been described as “The most Mohammedan church in the whole of Spain.”\n\nThe entrance to San Baudelio de Berlanga is a single horseshoe-arched door on the north wall of the building, which leads directly into the nave of the church. Upon entering the hermitage, visitors are greeted by a large circular pillar that rises to the vaults of the apse. From the top of the pillar project eight ribbed arches, which are supported at the four corners and middle of the walls of the church. These arches are horseshoe forms with corner ribs supported by small Moorish inspired squinches.\n\nSimilar to the palm tree, which symbolizes Saint Baudilus, it is not unlikely that this central column was designed by an architect to represent a palm tree, attribute of the Saint. Atop the pillar, in between the sprouting arches, is a small cavity, which is believed to be a place where treasures of the church or relics of its saint were once secured. The interior of this space is ribbed in Moorish style, with crisscrossing arches around a domed top, similar to the vaulted dome of the nearby hermitage of .\n\nAnother unusual feature of San Baudelio de Berlanga is its gallery, which spans the interior side of the west wall. This tribune is constructed of a double row of horseshoe arches, which support a choir area on the second floor, accessible by the stairs on the south wall. Projecting into the nave, and supported by the tribune, is a small oratory, which sits directly against the nave’s central pillar. This small chapel is barrel vaulted, and has a window on either of its sides. It is no larger than a pulpit.The apsidal chapel, which joins the main building on its eastern side, is accessible through another horseshoe arched doorway, and sits four steps higher than the floor of the nave. At its back wall is a small loophole shaped window, which until it was closed off, would have allowed morning light to enter the chapel. This room is also barrel vaulted, and almost identical in size and shape to the chapel of the hermitage of San Cruz at Maderuelo.\nOne other unique aspect of San Baudelio de Berlanga is its connection to a small cave that lies under the hill on which the church sits. Access to this cave is gained through a doorway under the tribune, against the south wall. This is the cave in which a hermit may have lived at one time, possibly before the construction of the church.\n\nThe only natural means of light in the church would have been through the open doorway on the North wall, a now closed up window also found on the North wall, or a small window on the West wall that was converted from a doorway, which would have been an alternate entrance into the oratory.\n\nElements of San Baudelio, like the double rows of pillars and arches, recall the stylistic elements of the Great Mosque of Cordova. The ribbed arches, squinches or niches beneath the arches, and the method of construction in the lantern are all apparently derived from areas like Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia in the Near East. It is important to note though, that not all the oriental aesthetics that occur in Spanish churches were introduced by the Moors. Many had already been introduced to Spain during Visigothic times through its commercial and ecclesiastical connections with the Near East. The use of rectangular frames around arches and intersecting ribbed vaults at San Baudelio was originally inspired by the extension of the mosque of Cordoba by Al-Hakam II, and it can also be seen in the church at San Millan de La Cogolla.\n\nThe hermitage housed many fine Romanesque frescoes from about 1125; most of these have been removed, but some have remained. Two sections, transferred to canvas, are now in the Indianapolis Museum of Art, showing the \"Entry of Christ into Jerusalem\" and the \"Wedding at Cana\". Other sections, including \"The Healing of the Blind Man and the Raising of Lazarus\" and \"The Temptation of Christ\" are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and in the Prado. The paintings were done by the Catalan Master of Tahull (Taüll in Catalan), whose best known works are in Sant Climent de Taüll and the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya in Barcelona, with two other painters. The scenes of the \"Life of Christ\" are unusual in Spanish painting at this period; these are in American museums, while smaller elements including scenes of hunting and falconry and decorative copies of textiles are in Madrid as well as New York. The frescoes include that of a camel and of a war elephant, which were inspired by Muslim motifs.\n\nOriginally every part of the church was covered with some kind of decoration. We can still see some of the remaining art work even though it has been eroded because of neglect or water seeping through the walls and loosening the plaster. Twenty-two compositions were removed from the church and brought to the United States and the Museo del Prado Madrid. Compared to other churches in Western Europe with painted interiors, San Baudelio is one of the best preserved from the Romanesque period. There are three main sections of decoration: the first two are narratives and secular motifs; the large compositions from the vaults and the walls from the main body of the building; these have been largely removed. The third group, too damaged to be removed, are left inside the small oratory of the tribune.\n\nUnder the lunette of the apse, there are two figures sitting under arches: St. Nicholas on the left of the window and Saint Baudilus at the right. We know it is Saint Baudilus because of the inscription BAVDILI(VS) even though some of the lower part of the image is missing. St. Nicholas is identified by the inscription (NICOL)AVS and under him the words IN D€I NOMINE can be seen. St. Nicholas is depicted sitting on a pillowed chair with a luminous cloud or a halo surrounding him. Some of his features include tonsured white hair and beard, an alb, a red mantle over the alb, and sandals. He is holding a crozier in his left hand and his right palm is raised outward. Both figures are placed against a striped background of what looks like faded teal green, pale red, forest green, yellow, and dark red. Under the window appears a long-legged, long necked bird, with a white body, and yellow and red wings. The ibis is painted against a dark red background, below it is inscribed: . . . E . . . AVLA DE(I).Around the seventeenth century the interior of the church was completely white washed due to the severe state of deterioration of the murals. But, a single piece was eventually found and transferred to canvas and it is still possible to identify the figure.\n\nThe north wall contains two scenes. They are separated by a tree, and the image on the right is better preserved. The image at the right of the tree appears to portray the meeting of Mary Magdalene and Jesus in the garden after the resurrection, it might also be the instance \"she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus,\" or \"Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father:\" (John 20:17) Mary Magdalene is depicted with a halo surrounding her, white headdress and tunic, and red mantle. Jesus is dressed in a long white tunic and brown mantle and carries a book in his left hand (presumably the bible.) Of the image at the left of the tree only a single female figure is preserved. Dressed in a long white tunic and orange mantle, the female shrinks backward in astonishment and observes a figure to the left. Of the figure on her left only a small piece of orange red cloth is preserved. There is nothing to indicate what scene it is other than the adjoining figures to the right of the tree; it might represent another encounter of the meeting of Jesus and Mary Magdalene in the garden.\n\nThe murals in the vaulting of the church are almost all gone. There are a few fragments left that contained scenes from the life of the Christ and the Virgin: The Adoration of the Magi, Adoration of the Shepherds, Circumcision, The flight into Egypt, and probably the Annunciation and Presentation in the Temple.\n\nOn the south wall are some scenes of Jesus’s miracles. One of these depicts him healing the blind man. Jesus, shown with short red hair and a beard, a large cross, and a halo surrounding him. He wears an orange tunic and a blue mantle. He touches the eyes of the blind man that kneels before him. The blind man is wearing a long white tunic, red hose, and has short dark hair. His blindness is symbolized by closed eyes.\n\nAlso appearing in the same space as the blind man is the Resurrection of Lazarus, one of the best preserved of the series. Lazarus, is shown wrapped up like a mummy and placed in a black sarcophagus. Two seemingly holy women lift one end of the cover. Jesus touches the body of Lazarus with a long staff, which turns into a cross, and he is joined by a beardless figure with red hair, possibly St. John, who is holding a green book in his left hand. Jesus is shown with a yellow-crossed nimbus, red hair, and pointed beard, and he wears an orange tunic with wide sleeves under a green mantle. The disciple at the left, also depicted with red hair, is wearing a long grey tunic and dark blue mantle. Both the women have halos and they wear pale green-orange headdresses that fall over the shoulders. The background is divided by wide stripes of dark blue, violet, red, and green.\n\nThe next miracle, the Marriage at Cana, takes up half the space on the left on the west wall. The composition is disrupted by a doorway and is sectioned by a column. Jesus, the bridegroom and bride are seated at the feast. The table is shown covered with a white cloth and has circular loaves of bread and bowls of fruit. Jesus, at the left, is holding a knife in his left hand and blesses with his right hand. As in the previous scene, Jesus is depicted with nimbus and dark red hair and beard, and is dressed in a long red tunic and dark blue mantle. The bearded bridegroom, who is holding a knife in his right hand and lifts his left hand in a gesture of speech, wears a tall hat, pale green tunic with an orange lining, brown mantle, light brown hose, and red sandals. The bride, who is seated at the right, is dressed in an orange headdress, a pale green robe with wide sleeves, and raises her right hand with her palm turned outward.The remaining piece of the west wall contains a portrayal of the Temptation of Christ in the Wilderness, and in this scene he appears twice. At the left he is shown at the moment when Satan states \"If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.\" The devil, depicted with long horns, wings, and a human body with claw feet, drops three large stones to the ground. Jesus, wearing a long orange tunic and dark blue mantle, holds up his left hand with palm outward in a sign of refusal. In the following scene Jesus is portrayed on a pinnacle of the temple. Here the devil is shown with human feet, wings, and a bearded animal-like head with long locks. Jesus is dressed as before and the temple is symbolized by a small building with circular windows and a gable roof. On the right, one of the angels who came to minister unto him speaks with a third demon, who appears to be half animal and half human. The body of the last devil is yellow and he has long hair and a pointed beard. The ugliness of the demons strike a sharp contrast to the poetic portrayal of the figure of Jesus.The sequence of Christ’s Passion starts at the north wall with Christ’s entrance into Jerusalem. Jerusalem is symbolized at the right by a structure with an open door. Above are crenelated walls with windows. Outside awaiting Christ are two boys in red and blue tunics holding olive branches in their hands. Jesus rides on the donkey side-saddle in eastern fashion, approaching from the left. He has a halo with a cross, red hair, and beard, a teal tunic and a dark blue mantle. With his right hand he blesses as he holds a palm branch in his left hand. A baby horse accompanies the donkey Jesus is riding. Behind him follow the Apostles. We can see seven full Apostles with Peter, who is depicted here with white hair and a beard, leading the group. The red-headed St. John follows him.The Last Supper fills the rest of the north wall. Jesus is seated behind a table with a white cloth in the center of the composition. Many of the disciples are depicted holding knives and raising their hands as if to ask “is it me Lord?” when Jesus says “One of you will betray me.” We see St. John at Jesus’s bosom and Judas in the front of the composition. The food they are eating seem to be loaves and fish with Judas touching the fish in a bowl. As is customary, St. Peter is featured with a white beard and balding. St. Paul is also portrayed with white hair and a pointed beard, even though he was not one of the original disciples.\n\nThe Crucifixion itself appears to be missing from the walls of San Baudelio so it may have eroded with time. Logically it should follow after The Last Supper. It may well be that the Crucifixion was on the east wall near the Roman soldiers, since the Bible does mention them near the cross at the time of the crucifixion.The next surviving scene depicts the visit by the women to the tomb of Jesus early on Sunday. Originally this scene was on the left side of the south wall of the nave but was removed and currently is in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. An angel with a green halo seems to be standing in front of the tomb itself so we do not see the stone rolled away as described in the bible. The guards stand, frightened, with bent knees, one covering his face as if to shield himself from the blinding light of the angel. At the very right of the composition, the three women approach wearing halos and holding large vases with ointment. An Angel is depicted wearing an orange headdress with a greenish mantle, as the three Maries approach from the right.It seems originally that all four walls of the nave had eight large compositions, containing the life and passion of the Christ. It is highly possible at least four scenes may have included the Journey to Emmaus, Doubting Thomas, the Descent of the Holy Spirit on the side walls of the apse. Ideally the series would have concluded with the image of the enthroned Savior of the Last Judgment. It would have probably been similar to the apse of Saint Martin de Fenouillar with the Savior surrounded by the twelve evangelists (including Paul) and the twenty-four elders of Revelation.\n\nOn the lower west wall of the Church is the scene of a wounded deer as it flees the hunter aiming at him with the loaded crossbow. The hunting of this animal is a subject very much in conformity with the iconography from ancient times and the Middle Ages. For the Romans, the deer had a symbolic character of abstaining of the evil of the world. In Christian culture, this icon represents the soul. The deer is also associated with Christ triumphing over the dragon, making it the metaphorical claim a hunt for souls.\n\nNext to the wounded deer on the right is a hunter riding a horse, helped by three dogs chasing hares, which end up trapped in the forest. The hare is a symbol in Christian iconography of the fragility of the soul and strong sexual desire or lust, which must be harassed and overcome.Continuing to the right on the north wall is a Falconer. Falconry was considered, both in Islam and the Christian Middle Ages as one of the noblest of hunting. The falconer, exhibiting his noble raptor, stands in a victorious posture like a knight triumphing, with the help of faith (the Falcon), over corrupt and evil animals like hares.\n\nLocated on the north tribune of the Church, is what looks to be a warrior carrying a spear and a shield. To the right of the warrior is what looks like an elephant. The symbol of humility, the elephant is associated with the figure of Christ, who became the smallest and most obedient of humans to prevent his own death. The elephant of San Baudelio carries on its back a castle, allegory of diseases and miseries that have to be borne in the course of earthly life and the weight of the sins of existence. Next to the elephant is a bear. The bear is sometimes associated with the sin of gluttony and the unknown of the caves he inhabits. Perhaps the warrior who shares the stage with him, can vanquish him.\n\nBehind the warrior on the opposite side of the tribune a camel is depicted, an exotic animal, well known in the ancient world for their roles in the war, transport and the circus. The camel is associated with Early Christian art along with the Magi and other biblical stories. Judging by this camel’s deformations, the artist of San Baudelio did not know what a camel looked like. To the left of the camel, vegetation appears as ornaments as well as textile patterns. They are arranged in circles, organized in rows, starting with the smaller ones. On the wall near the central pillar are two greyhounds. On the east wall at the start of the staircase there is a two faced bovine.\n\nThere is debate as to the origin of the paintings.\n\nIt is believed that the frescos were painted at the same time by two different painters. An older painter and a younger painter. The apse painted by the Master of Baudelio would have been painted first, after the entire mural scheme had been decided. Assembling the pictorial program required painters to collect images into sections within the church structure and into registers along the wall. Although at San Baudelio the registers were painted at the same time, certainly the lower zone would have been painted first. Perhaps living under the Muslim regime longer, accounts for the Moorish influence on the older painter’s use of Islamic themes. The younger painter might have been more versed in the Romanesque Christian iconography, possibly, because San Baudelio was in the wilderness between the Christian and Muslim border. Also, those of San Baudelio is similar to the fresco found in the found in The Church of The Vera Cruz De Maderuelo (Segovia).\n\n\n\n"}

From the architectonic point of view, it is beautiful: there was an altar with a painting of Saint James and some pilgrims on the way to the Sanctuary of Compostela; on the sides of the altar there were placed two statues of Saint James and Saint Andrew.\n\nAfter the 1866 laws on the suppression of religious Corporations, the church was confiscated and given to the town municipality, which used it as a Civic Library from 1875 to 1968 . \nToday (June 2018), after the last restoration works, it is the seat of the Ethnographic Museum of Musical Instruments \"Gaspare Cannone\".\n\nSince 1569 it hosted a Confraternity of Saint James of the Pilgrims, with the scope of assisting pilgrims, and the Confraternity of Saint Christopher, founded 40 years before, joined it; both of them had the running of a hospice for pilgrims which had to be founded.\n\nThe two confraternities had the privilege of “Fiera franca”, that is any tax exemption during the period of the feast, so the money saved, together with that one saved in the following years, was to be used for the assistance of pilgrims and the building of a hospice. As the periods were coincident for both Congregations, this provoked a quarrel between them and a fusion of the two institutions in one Confraternity, later elevated to a Company in 1619.\n\nIts brethren had a deep blue sackcloth, with mantles and hats, and they wore a red cross as emblem and a cane on their hands, like pilgrims. After the change to a Company occurred in 1619 (as affirms the historian Ignazio de Blasi), they probably wore \"a sackcloth and white visors, with the emblem of the cross ending like a sword, the characteristic insignia of the glorious Saint James, on the shoulders\" .\n\nIn 1642 they were renewed the privilege of \"Fiera franca\" and built, next to the church, a Hospice for pilgrims, working from 1649 to 1746, and that they had not completed in 1649 yet. These hospices were located in the town centres and carried out different activities, assisting poor or sick people, widows, orphans and foundlings, much more when the number of pilgrims on long distances decreased a lot.\n\nIn 1749 the Company did not run the hospice any longer, and probably it had been dissolved before; the Congregation of Charity, that administered its financial incomes, as they did not host pilgrims going to the Holy Land or to the various sanctuaries, assigned those financial returns to the poorhouse (Ricovero di Mendicità) which had to be founded using the patrimony inherited from the De Blasi Mangione.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12643716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12643716", "title": "Service innovation", "text": "Service innovation\n\nService innovation is used to refer to many things. These include but not limited to:\n\n\nThe Finnish research agency TEKES defines service innovation as \"a new or significantly improved service concept that is taken into practice. It can be for example a new customer interaction channel, a distribution system or a technological concept or a combination of them. A service innovation always includes replicable elements that can be identified and systematically reproduced in other cases or environments. The replicable element can be the service outcome or the service process as such or a part of them. A service innovation benefits both the service producer and customers and it improves its developer’s competitive edge. A service innovation is a service product or service process that is based on some technology or systematic method. In services however, the innovation does not necessarily relate to the novelty of the technology itself but the innovation often lies in the non-technological areas. Service innovations can for instance be new solutions in the customer interface, new distribution methods, novel application of technology in the service process, new forms of operation with the supply chain or new ways to organize and manage services.\"\n\nAnother definition proposed by Van Ark et al. (2003) states it as a \"new or considerably changed service concept, client interaction channel, service delivery system or technological concept that individually, but most likely in combination, leads to one or more (re)new(ed) service functions that are new to the firm and do change the service/good offered on the market and do require structurally new technological, human or organizational capabilities of the service organization.\" This definition covers the notions of technological and non-technological innovation. Non-technological innovations in services mainly arise from investment in intangible inputs.\n\nMany literatures on what makes for successful innovations of this kind comes from the New Service Development research field (e.g. Johne and Storey, 1998; Nijssen et al., 2006). Service design practitioners have also extensively discussed the features of effective service products and experiences. One of the key aspects of many service activities is the high involvement of the client/customer/user in the production of the final service. Without this co-production (i.e. interactivity of service production), the service would often not be created. This co-production, together with the intangibility of many service products, causes service innovation to often take forms rather different from those familiar through studies of innovation in manufacturing. Innovation researchers have, for this reason, stressed that much service innovation is hard to capture in traditional categories like product or process innovation. The co-production process, and the interactions between service provider and client, can also form the focus of innovation. A growing number of professional association have service sections that promote service innovation research, including INFORMS, ISSIP, and others.\n\nThus den Hertog (2000) who identifies four “dimensions” of service innovation, takes quite a different direction to much standard innovation theorizing.\n\nIn practice, the majority of service innovations will almost certainly involve various combinations of these four dimensions. For instance:\n\nAn elaboration of this model to suggest six dimensions of innovation was developed in the course of work on creative sectors, by Green, Miles and Rutter. As well as Technology and Production process, four dimensions were specified whose linkages are very strong in creative sectors like videogames, advertising and design: Cultural Product, Cultural Concept, Delivery and User Interface.\n\nThe service innovation literature is surprisingly poorly related to the literature on new product development, which has spawned a line of study on new service development. This often focuses on the managerially important issue of what makes for successful service innovation. See for example Johne and Storey (1998), who reviewed numerous New Service Development studies.\n\nIan Miles of the Manchester Institute of Innovation Research (MIoIR), The University of Manchester, is one of the scholars on the study of 'Service Innovation'. He coined the term in his 1993 article in the journal \"FUTURES\", (Vol. 25, No. 6, pp. 653–672,) . He listed a series of characteristic features of services, and associated these with particular types of innovation. Such innovations are often aimed at overcoming problems associated with service characteristics like the difficulty in demonstrating the service to the client, or the problems in storing and building up stocks of the service.\n\nAfter Miles (1993), numerous studies were made, one of the more recent studies that reaches similar conclusions was from a qualitative survey of service organizations by Candi (2007).) Note that the “product” related innovations below have a lot in common with new service development as discussed above. In the following list, features of services are linked to innovation strategies by the symbol »>.\n\nAdditionally, a number of more general tendencies in the innovation process in services have been noted. These include:\n\n\nThere have been many methods for service innovation design and one of these is Dominant Innovation methodology which is a systematic approach to discover the gaps of service value delivery through a scenario-based mapping. Dominant Innovation methodology is based on a visible/ and invisible matrix to map the growth gaps of product value and further develop an innovation ecosystem between evidence and supply sources. Design and service innovation have also been combined in the context of business acceleration using the Minimum Valuable Service model. The MVS is an open source methodology that integrates lean startup and Service Design and it has been largely adopted by startups and large organizations like Ge and Cisco in Silicon Valley.\n\nIn the traditional product-service system (PSS) business model, industries develop product with value-added service instead of single product itself, and provide their customers services that are needed. In this relationship, the market goal of manufacturers is not one-time product selling, but continuous profit from customers by total service solution, which can satisfy unmet customers’ needs. Most of PSS systems focus on ‘human-generated or human-related data’ instead of ‘machine-generated data or industrial data’, which may include machine controllers, sensors, manufacturing systems, etc. Early work using web-based product monitoring for remote product services including GM OnStar Telematics, Otis Remote Elevator Maintenance (REM), and GE Medical InSite during 1990s. Service innovation using web-based system was further developed for e-service applications. Recently, more advanced approaches using predictive analytics and cyber physical systems (CPS) can harvest large amounts of data of a variety of types to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations and other useful information from industrial and manufacturing systems and integrate with business automation software for improved productivity and innovation.\n\nIn recent years policy makers have begun to consider the potential for promoting services innovation as part of their economic development strategies. Such consideration has, in part, been driven by the growing contribution that services activities make to national and regional economies. It also reflects the emerging recognition that traditional policy measures such as R&D grants and technology transfer supports have been developed from a manufacturing perspective of the innovation process.\n\nThe European Commission and the OECD has been particularly active in seeking to generate reflection on services innovation and its policy implications. This has resulted in studies such as the OECD’s reports into knowledge intensive services, and the European Commission Expert Group report on services innovation – the report of the group, \"Fostering Innovation in Services\" as well as various TrendChart studies. The European Commission has also launched a number of Knowledge Intensive Services Platforms designed to act as laboratories for new public policies for services innovation. Few economic development agencies at the member state level, and fewer still at the regional level, have translated this new thinking on services innovation into policy action. Finland is an exception, where knowledge intensive business services have been a focus of much regional work (esp. the Uusimaa region).\n\nFinland has been active in thinking about the policy implications of services innovation. This has seen TEKES – the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation – launch the \"SERVE\" initiative, designed to support ‘Finnish companies and research organisations in the development of innovative service concepts that can be reproduced or replicated and where some technology or systematic method is applied .’ Germany has also undertaken initiatives for services R&D, and Canada and Norway have programs as well.\n\nIreland has been considering a services-focused innovation policy, with \"Forfás\" – its national policy and advisory board for enterprise, trade, science, technology and innovation – having undertaken a review of Ireland’s existing policy and support measures for innovation, and outlined options for a new policy and framework environment in support of service innovation activity.\n\nAt the regional level, limited information is available on how Europe’s regions are responding to the challenges presented by service innovation. [CM International] has recently published a European survey on services innovation and regional policy responses. The results of this suggest that very few regions in France, the UK and Ireland have an explicit focus on services and innovation. Many do, however, express a desire to address this issue in the coming future.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43106703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43106703", "title": "Signalism", "text": "Signalism\n\nSignalism ( / Signalizam; from: lat. Signum – \"sign, signal\") represents an international neo-avant-garde literal and art movement. It gathered wider support base both in former Yugoslavia and the world in the late 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s.\n\nThe beginning of Signalism dates back to 1959 when its founder and main theoretician Miroljub Todorović started with his linguistic experiments. His main belief was that there can be no significant leap forward in poetry without revolutionizing its main medium – the language.\n\nThe birth of Signalism in Serbian literature and culture, with its tendency to revolutionize other arts as well (visual, theater, comics, music and movies), came from the need to eliminate the spent models carried on by poetic and cultural traditions, as well as from the necessity to take on the challenges and spirit of the modern technological and electronic civilization. In its program (\"Manifesto\" and other guiding texts) as well as in its art pieces, Signalism made a clean break from the principles of neoromantism and late symbolism still governing Serbian literature. Its goal was set to radically change poetry both through content and form, and make it compatible with the contemporary times.\n\nRevolutionizing of the poetic language started with the introduction of the symbols, formulas and linguistic forms of the \"hard\" sciences (physics, biology, chemistry, mathematics, biochemistry and astronomy). Furthermore, the language was made visual by dispersing words and sentences into syllables and letters forming visually recognizable patterns, as well as by introducing non-verbal symbols into the text (drawings, photographs, graphs…) for the purpose of creating a collage of verbal and visual elements. This first phase of Signalism is often referred to as \"Scientism\", with the most prominent examples including the books \"Planeta\" (Planet, 1965) and \"Putovanje u Zvezdaliju\" (A trip to Starland, 1971) as well as poetry cycles \"Belančevina\" (Protein), \"Kiseonik\" (Oxygen), \"Ožilište\" (Nursery) and others in which the topics are Space, Time and Matter.\n\nIn their for decade long research and creative pursuit that followed, Signalists significantly expanded cognitive boundaries and genre profile of modern Serbian poetry. Signalist poetry can be divided into two main forms: verbal and non-verbal. Verbal poetry consists of scientist, aleatoric (random), stochastic, technological, phenomenological, slang and apeironistic poetry. Non-verbal poetry subtypes include visual, object, sound and gestual poetry.\n\nSignalism made significant advances in prose (experimental novel and short story). There is also a number of significant Signalist children literature accomplishments. In visual art strides are made in body art, mail art, performance and conceptual art.\n\nThree manifestos helped define Signalism as a neo-avant-garde movement that negates literal, artistic and cultural heritage, poetic and aesthetic conventions and canonical ways of creativity by insisting on creative experimentation – \"Manifesto of scientific poetry\" (1968), \"Signalist manifesto (Regulae poesis)\" (1969) and \"Signalism\" (1970).\n\nThe movement was significantly boosted by the international magazine \"Signal\", inaugurated in 1970. Nine issues of \"Signal\" appeared between 1970 and 1973, presenting a number of domestic and international artists, as well as printing bibliographical data about the avant-garde publications all around the world. From 1973 until 1995 magazine could not be published, mainly for financial reasons. From 1995 to 2004 another 21 issues of \"Signal\" appeared. The new release of \"Signal\" revitalized the Signalist movement and brought an army of young artists into the movement in 21st century.\n\nOn the work of Miroljub Todorović and Signalism movement that he had founded, three doctoral dissertations have been defended: Dr. Julian Kornhauser, Jagiellonian University in Kraków, Poland, 1980; Dr. Živan Živković, Faculty of Philology in Belgrade, 1991 and Dr. Milivoje Pavlović, University of Kosovska Mitrovica, 2002. Twenty monographs have also been published on the same subject.\n\n\nThree anthologies were also published in Serbia: \"Signalist poetry\" (1971), \"Concrete, visual and signalist poetry\" (1975), \"Mail-Art Mail-Poetry\" (1980), as well as several collections and almanacs.\n\nMany poets, writers and painters accepted the basic concepts of Signalism, further developing and spreading the ideas of this Serbian (Yugoslav) neo-avant-garde movement.\n\nBesides the founder of Signalism Miroljub Todorović (\"Kyberno\", 1970; \"The Pig is an Excellent Swimmer\", 1971; \"Bumpkin Shows Off\", slang poetry, 1974; \"Insect on the Temple\", 1978; \"Algol\", 1980, \"Textum\", 1981; \"Chinese Erotism\", 1983; \"Knock-Out\", 1984; \"I Mount Rocinante Again\", 1987; \"Water-Snake Drinks Water\", 1988; \"The Diary of Avant-Garde\", 1990; \"Electric Chair\", slang poetry, 1998; \"I’ve Just Opened my Mail\", 2000; \"It Walked Into my Ear\", slang stories, 2005; \"Blue Wind\", 2006; \"Slang Stories\", 2007;) important contributors to the theory and practice of Signalism include Marina Abramović, Vlada Stojiljković, Zvonimir Kostić Palanski, Slobodan Pavićević (\"Flowers’ Silicates\", 1973; \"Roadworks\", 1984), Milivoje Pavlović (\"White Book\", 1974; \"The World In Signals\", 1996), Zoran Popović, Ljubiša Jocić (\"Moonshine in Tetrapack\", 1975; \"What’s the Time\", 1976: \"Essays on Signalism\", 1994), Jaroslav Supek, Zvonko Sarić (\"Overcoat until the Dawn\", 2001; \"Soul Catcher\", 2003), Bogislav Marković (\"Altai Dust\", 2006), Ilija Bakić (\"Prenatal Life\", 1997; \"New Babylon\", 1998; \"Protoplasm\", 2003; \"The Autumn of Gatherers\", 2007; \"To be Continued\", 2009), Slobodan Škerović (\"Indigo\", 2005; \"All Colors of Arcturus\", 2006; \"Chimera or Borg\", 2008), Žarko Đurović (\"The World of Signalism\", 2002), Dušan Vidaković, Dobrivoje Jevtić, Dejan Bogojević, Andrej Tišma, Dobrica Kamperelić, Milivoj Anđelković, Zoran Stefanović and others.\n\nNumerous domestic and international critics and theoreticians hold Signalism in high regard:\n\nProf. Miloš Bandić: \"Signalism is – after Zenitism, Surrealism and the movement of social literature – the next and autochthonous literary and artistic movement in Serbian literature of 20th century. At the same time, in contemporary Yugoslav literature and culture, Signalism is confirmed as an exclusive modern dimension and a separate artistic form and production. Without it all would probably be poorer and who knows how deprived.\"\n\nOskar Davičo, famous writer: \"For the first time from the appearance of Surrealism in the twenties, we can joyfully confirm that with exploration of Miroljub Todorović, Serbian poetry can again catch up with the genuine worldwide avant-garde explorations.\"\n\nZoran Markuš, visual arts critic: \"Signalism is our parallel phenomena within the brackets of the most extreme avant-garde and that explains its international expansion, approval and importance in certain artistic and intellectual circles.\"\n\nDave Oz, Canadian multimedia artist: \"True essence of Signalism is that it expects appearance of planetary consciousness.\"\n\nGillo Dorfles, Italian arts theoretician: \"Signalism means a step forward, in relation to concrete poetry, visual poetry and the art of the sign.\"\n\nProf. Milivoje Pavlović: \"Thanks to Miroljub Todorović and the group that follows him, Signalism with its mainstream represents the arc which connects in a creative manner avant-garde aims from the period between wars with the contemporary epoch, bringing valuable innovations and connecting Serbian art with the modern world’s processes.\" (From the book \"The Keys of Signalist Poetics\")\n\n\n\n"}

She is known for writing the TV mini-series, \"Sally Hemings: An American Scandal\" (2000), which was the first time that the Jefferson-Hemings relationship had been explored on TV, and with Hemings portrayed as a fully realized woman. In 2001, Andrews was the first African American to win the Writers Guild of America award for Original Long Form, for her script for this mini-series. Andrews had earlier explored her interest in Hemings with a play, \"The Mistress of Monticello\", which was read at a workshop in Chicago in 1985.\n\nTina Yvonne Andrews was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. She attended New York University, where her major studies were in Drama.\n\nShe spent many years acting in such series as \"Days of Our Lives\", where she originated the role of Valerie Grant from 1975 to 1977. Her character was part of the first interracial romance shown on daytime television. She also acted in the influential TV mini-series, \"Roots\" (1977), as Aurelia, the girlfriend of the character Kunta Kinte.\n\nFrom this role, she met and became professional partners with Alex Haley, the author of the book on which it was based and the screenplay for the series. Haley hired Andrews to work with him on the miniseries \"Alex Haley's Great Men of African Descent\", which aired on PBS. Haley also mentored Andrews' literary work.\n\nAndrews is married to Stephen Gaines, an award-winning producer in theatre, and documentary filmmaker.\n\nTina Andrews had been long interested in the story of Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson. She wrote a play, \"The Mistress of Monticello\", which was produced in Chicago in 1985 to good notices. About ten years later, her play was brought to the notice of producer Craig Anderson, and he started working with Andrews on developing it as a script for TV. Her play was produced in staged readings at the Southampton Cultural Center in February 2013.\n\nAndrews ended up working on the Hemings project for nearly 16 years. She did research, both on Hemings, about whom little is known, and Jefferson. Craig Anderson had optioned the rights to historian Fawn McKay Brodie's 1974 biography of Jefferson, which had explored the possibility of the long-rumored relationship with Hemings. She concluded that they did have a liaison and children. While Andrews was working on her script, a DNA study in 1998 demonstrated a match between the male lines of descendants of Hemings and Jefferson, which shifted the consensus of major historians of Jefferson, such as Joseph Ellis. He announced that he believed that Jefferson had a long-term relationship with Hemings and fathered all her children. Andrews completed her script, and the team took it to production.\n\nIn 2000, CBS aired \"Sally Hemings: An American Scandal\". It was directed by Charles Haid and starred Carmen Ejogo as Hemings and Sam Neill as Jefferson.\n\nAs PBS noted of the mini-series in a \"Frontline\" program, \"Jefferson's Blood\" (2000), about the Jefferson-Hemings controversy, \"Though many quarreled with the portrayal of Hemings as unrealistically modern and heroic, no major historian challenged the series' premise that Hemings and Jefferson had a 38-year relationship that produced children.\"\n\nAndrews has also written screenplays, including the movie, \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\" (1998).\n\nFollowing the production of the mini-series in 2000, Andrews published the non-fiction book \"Sally Hemings: An American Scandal: The Struggle to Tell the Controversial Truth\" (2001). It recounts her work over 16 years to bring Hemings' story to a larger audience. The book was published by Malibu Press.\n\nShe wrote an essay for \"The First Time I Got Paid For It: Writers Tales From the Hollywood Trenches\" (2002).\n\n\n\nAndrews played Valerie Grant in the hit soap opera series \"Days of Our Lives\" from 1975 to 1977. She also played Angie Wheeler in \"The Sanford Arms\", in 1977, Aurelia in \"Roots\", and Valerie on \"Falcon Crest\" in 1983. She played Josie in the TV movie \"Born Innocent\" with Linda Blair. She has also made guest appearances as characters on many shows, including \"The Odd Couple\", \"Love Story\", \"Sanford and Son\", \"Good Times\" and \"The Brady Bunch\". She also performed in films such as \"Conrack\" and \"Carny\".\n\n"}

Underdrawing was used extensively by 15th century painters like Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden. These artists \"underdrew\" with a brush, using hatching strokes for shading, using water-based black paint, before underpainting and overpainting with oils. Cennino D'Andrea Cennini (14th century most likely) describes a different type of underdrawing, made with graded tones rather than hatching, for egg tempera.\n\nIn some cases, underdrawing can be clearly visualized using infrared reflectography because carbon black pigments absorb infrared light, whereas opaque pigments such as lead white are transparent with infrared light. Underdrawing in many works, for example, the Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington) or the Arnolfini Portrait, reveals that artists made alterations, sometimes radical ones, to their compositions.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10874393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10874393", "title": "Western painting", "text": "Western painting\n\nThe history of Western painting represents a continuous, though disrupted, tradition from antiquity until the present time. Until the mid-19th century it was primarily concerned with representational and Classical modes of production, after which time more modern, abstract and conceptual forms gained favor. \n\nInitially serving imperial, private, civic, and religious patronage, Western painting later found audiences in the aristocracy and the middle class. From the Middle Ages through the Renaissance painters worked for the church and a wealthy aristocracy. Beginning with the Baroque era artists received private commissions from a more educated and prosperous middle class. The idea of \"art for art's sake\" began to find expression in the work of the Romantic painters like Francisco de Goya, John Constable, and J. M. W. Turner. During the 19th century commercial galleries became established and continued to provide patronage in the 20th century.\n\nWestern painting reached its zenith in Europe during the Renaissance, in conjunction with the refinement of drawing, use of perspective, ambitious architecture, tapestry, stained glass, sculpture, and the period before and after the advent of the printing press. Following the depth of discovery and the complexity of innovations of the Renaissance, the rich heritage of Western painting continued from the Baroque period to Contemporary art.\n\nThe history of painting reaches back in time to artifacts from pre-historic artists, and spans all cultures. The oldest known paintings are at the Grotte Chauvet in France, claimed by some historians to be about 32,000 years old. They are engraved and painted using red ochre and black pigment and show horses, rhinoceros, lions, buffalo, mammoth, or humans often hunting. There are examples of cave paintings all over the world—in France, India, Spain, Portugal, China, Australia etc. There are many common themes throughout the different places that the paintings have been found; implying the universality of purpose and similarity of the impulses that might have inspired the artists to create the imagery. Various conjectures have been made as to the meaning these paintings had to the artists who made them. Prehistoric men may have painted animals to \"catch\" their soul or spirit in order to hunt them more easily, or the paintings may represent an animistic vision and homage to surrounding nature, or they may be the result of a basic need of expression that is innate to human beings, or they may be recordings of the life experiences of the artists and related stories from the members of their circle.\n\nAncient Egypt, a civilization with strong traditions of architecture and sculpture (both originally painted in bright colors), had many mural paintings in temples and buildings, and painted illustrations on papyrus manuscripts. Egyptian wall painting and decorative painting is often graphic, sometimes more symbolic than realistic. Egyptian painting depicts figures in bold outline and flat silhouette, in which symmetry is a constant characteristic. Egyptian painting has close connection with its written language—called Egyptian hieroglyphs. Painted symbols are found amongst the first forms of written language. The Egyptians also painted on linen, remnants of which survive today.\nAncient Egyptian paintings survived due to the extremely dry climate. The ancient Egyptians created paintings to make the afterlife of the deceased a pleasant place. The themes included journey through the afterworld or their protective deities introducing the dead to the gods of the underworld. Some examples of such paintings are paintings of the gods and goddesses Ra, Horus, Anubis, Nut, Osiris and Isis. Some tomb paintings show activities that the deceased were involved in when they were alive and wished to carry on doing for eternity. In the New Kingdom and later, the Book of the Dead was buried with the entombed person. It was considered important for an introduction to the afterlife.\n\nTo the north of Egypt was the Minoan civilization on the island of Crete. The wall paintings found in the palace of Knossos are similar to those of the Egyptians but much more free in style.\nAround 1100 BC, tribes from the north of Greece conquered Greece and its art took a new direction. The culture of ancient Greece is noteworthy for its outstanding contributions to the visual arts. Painting on pottery of ancient Greece and ceramics gives a particularly informative glimpse into the way society in ancient Greece functioned. Many fine examples of black-figure vase painting and red-figure vase painting still exist. Some famous Greek painters who worked on wood panels and are mentioned in texts are Apelles, Zeuxis and Parrhasius; however, with the single exception of the Pitsa panels, no examples of ancient Greek panel painting survive, only written descriptions by their contemporaries or later Romans. Zeuxis lived in the 5th century BC and was said to be the first to use sfumato. According to Pliny the Elder, the realism of his paintings was such that birds tried to eat the painted grapes. Apelles is described as the greatest painter of antiquity, and is noted for perfect technique in drawing, brilliant color, and modeling.\n\nRoman art was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting. However, Roman painting does have important unique characteristics. Surviving Roman paintings include wall paintings and frescoes, many from villas in Campania, in Southern Italy at sites such as Pompeii and Herculaneum. Such painting can be grouped into 4 main \"styles\" or periods and may contain the first examples of trompe-l'œil, pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape. Almost the only painted portraits surviving from the ancient world are a large number of coffin-portraits of bust form found in the Late Antique cemetery of Al-Fayum. Although these were neither of the best period nor the highest quality, they are impressive in themselves, and give an idea of the quality that the finest ancient work must have had. A very small number of miniatures from Late Antique illustrated books also survive, and a rather larger number of copies of them from the Early Medieval period.\n\nThe rise of Christianity imparted a different spirit and aim to painting styles. Byzantine art, once its style was established by the 6th century, placed great emphasis on retaining traditional iconography and style, and gradually evolved during the thousand years of the Byzantine Empire and the living traditions of Greek and Russian Orthodox icon-painting. Byzantine painting has a hieratic feeling and icons were and still are seen as a representation of divine revelation. There were many frescos, but fewer of these have survived than mosaics.\nByzantine art has been compared to contemporary abstraction, in its flatness and highly stylised depictions of figures and landscape. Some periods of Byzantine art, especially the so-called Macedonian art of around the 10th century, are more flexible in approach. Frescos of the Palaeologian Renaissance of the early 14th century survive in the Chora Church in Istanbul.\nIn post-Antique Catholic Europe the first distinctive artistic style to emerge that included painting was the Insular art of the British Isles, where the only surviving examples are miniatures in Illuminated manuscripts such as the Book of Kells. These are most famous for their abstract decoration, although figures, and sometimes scenes, were also depicted, especially in Evangelist portraits. Carolingian and Ottonian art also survives mostly in manuscripts, although some wall-painting remain, and more are documented. The art of this period combines Insular and \"barbarian\" influences with a strong Byzantine influence and an aspiration to recover classical monumentality and poise.\n\nWalls of Romanesque and Gothic churches were decorated with frescoes as well as sculpture and many of the few remaining murals have great intensity, and combine the decorative energy of Insular art with a new monumentality in the treatment of figures. Far more miniatures in Illuminated manuscripts survive from the period, showing the same characteristics, which continue into the Gothic period.\n\nPanel painting becomes more common during the Romanesque period, under the heavy influence of Byzantine icons. Towards the middle of the 13th century, Medieval art and Gothic painting became more realistic, with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in Italy with Cimabue and then his pupil Giotto. From Giotto on, the treatment of composition by the best painters also became much more free and innovative. They are considered to be the two great medieval masters of painting in western culture. Cimabue, within the Byzantine tradition, used a more realistic and dramatic approach to his art. His pupil, Giotto, took these innovations to a higher level which in turn set the foundations for the western painting tradition. Both artists were pioneers in the move towards naturalism.\n\nChurches were built with more and more windows and the use of colorful stained glass become a staple in decoration. One of the most famous examples of this is found in the cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris. By the 14th century Western societies were both richer and more cultivated and painters found new patrons in the nobility and even the bourgeoisie. Illuminated manuscripts took on a new character and slim, fashionably dressed court women were shown in their landscapes. This style soon became known as International Gothic style and was dominant from 1375–1425 with and tempera panel paintings and altarpieces gaining importance.\n\nThe Renaissance (French for 'rebirth'), a cultural movement roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th century, was driven by Renaissance humanism and the study of classical sources. In painting, in the 1420s and 1430s leading painters in Italy and the Low Countries separately developed new ways of painting which allowed the paintings to appear more realistic than in the works of established painters, whose style is referred to as International Gothic, or in some cases as Proto-Renaissance (mainly in Italy). This period, lasting until about 1495, became known as the Early Renaissance. \n\nIn the Flanders area of the Low Countries, following developments made in the illumination of manuscripts, especially by the Limbourg Brothers, who died in 1416, artists became fascinated by the tangible in the visible world and began representing objects in an extremely naturalistic way. The adoption of oil painting whose first use on panel paintings was traditionally, but erroneously, credited to Jan van Eyck, made possible a new verisimilitude in depicting this naturalism. The medium of oil paint was already present in the work of Melchior Broederlam (who died in 1409), but Robert Campin (previously known as the Master of Flémalle) and van Eyck brought its use to new heights and employed it to represent the naturalism for which they were aiming. With this new medium, the painters of this period were capable of creating richer colors with a deep intense tonality. The illusion of glowing light with a porcelain-like finish characterized Early Netherlandish painting and was a major difference to the matte surface of tempera paint used in Italy. \nUnlike the Italians, whose work drew heavily from the art of ancient Rome, the northerners retained a stylistic residue of the sculpture and illuminated manuscripts of the Middle Ages (especially its naturalism). Another important Netherlandish painter of this period was Rogier van der Weyden, a pupil of Campin, whose compositions stressed human emotion and drama, demonstrated for instance in his Descent from the Cross, which ranks among the most famous works of the 15th century and was the most influential Netherlandish painting of Christ's crucifixion. Other important artists were Hugo van der Goes (whose work was highly influential in Italy), Dieric Bouts (who was among the first northern painters to demonstrate the use of a single vanishing point), Petrus Christus, Hans Memling and Gerard David. Collectively, the advances in painting in Europe north of the Alps is known as the Northern Renaissance. \n\nIn Italian Renaissance painting, the art of Classical antiquity inspired a style of painting that emphasized the ideal. Masaccio is credited with making advances in linear perspective, the depiction of volume in his figures, and in portraying emotions on the faces of his figures in the 1420s. Then, artists such as Paolo Uccello, Fra Angelico, Piero della Francesca, Andrea Mantegna, Filippo Lippi, and Sandro Botticelli, in the Early Renaissance period lasting to about 1495, and then Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo Buonarroti, and Raphael during the High Renaissance from about 1495 to 1520, took painting to a higher level through the use of perspective, the study of human anatomy and proportion, and through their development of an unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques. A somewhat more naturalistic High Renaissance style emerged in Venice. Painters of the Venetian school, such as Giovanni Bellini, Giorgione, Titian, and Veronese, were less concerned with precision in their drawing than with the richness of color and unity of effect that could be achieved by a more spontaneous approach to painting. \n\nFlemish, Dutch and German painters of the Northern High Renaissance such as Albrecht Dürer, Lucas Cranach, Matthias Grünewald, and Hans Holbein the Younger had a different approach than their Italian counterparts, one that is more realistic and less idealized. Some northern painters, beginning with Dürer in the 1490s, traveled to Italy to see works of the Italian High Renaissance and they incorporated the features of the Italian art into their own to varying degrees.A generation later, the start of genre painting as a subject for large works began with Peter Aertsen and Pieter Bruegel. A later generation of Northern Renaissance painters who traveled to Rome and adopted much of the idealized approach of the Italian Renaissance became known as Romanists.\nRenaissance painting reflects the revolution of ideas and science (astronomy, geography) that occurred in this period, the Reformation, and the invention of the printing press. Printmaking became increasingly important, and practiced by many painters. Dürer, considered one of the greatest of printmakers, states that painters are not mere artisans but thinkers as well. With the development of easel painting in the Renaissance, painting gained independence from architecture. Easel paintings—movable pictures which could be hung easily on walls—became a popular alternative to paintings fixed to furniture, walls or other structures. Following centuries dominated by religious imagery, secular subject matter slowly returned to Western painting. Artists included visions of the world around them, or the products of their own imaginations in their paintings. Those who could afford the expense could become patrons and commission portraits of themselves or their family.\n\nThe High Renaissance in Italy gave rise to a stylized art known as Mannerism after 1520, although some painters, such as Titian and Paolo Veronese, continued painting in a High Renaissance style late into the century. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterized art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The calm Virgins of Raphael and serene expressions of Leonardo's subjects are replaced by the troubled expressions of Pontormo and the emotional intensity of El Greco. Restless and unstable compositions, often extreme or disjunctive effects of perspective, and stylized poses are characteristic of Italian Mannerists such as Tintoretto, Pontormo, and Bronzino, and appeared later in the work of Northern Mannerists such as Hendrick Goltzius, Bartholomeus Spranger, and Joachim Wtewael.\n\nBaroque painting is associated with the Baroque cultural movement, a movement often identified with Absolutism and the Counter Reformation or Catholic Revival; the existence of important Baroque painting in non-absolutist and Protestant states also, however, underscores its popularity, as the style spread throughout Western Europe.\n\nBaroque painting is characterized by great drama, rich, deep color, and intense light and dark shadows with the purpose of the art being to evoke emotion and passion instead of the calm rationality that had been prized during the Renaissance. The earliest Baroque painters included the Caracci brothers, Annibale and Agostino, in the last score of the 16th century, and Caravaggio in the last decade of the century. Caravaggio is recognized as one of the greatest Baroque painters and an heir of the humanist painting of the High Renaissance. His realistic approach to the human figure, painted directly from life and dramatically spotlit against a dark background, shocked his contemporaries and opened a new chapter in the history of painting. Baroque was the dominant style of painting beginning around 1600 and continuing throughout the 17th century. Among the greatest painters of the Baroque are Rubens, Velázquez, Rembrandt, Frans Hals, Johannes Vermeer, Le Nain, Jusepe de Ribera, Poussin, Tour, and Claude Lorraine, who focused on landscape painting. Poussin, Claude and La Tour, all French, adopted a \"classical\" Baroque style with less focus on emotion and greater attention to the outine of the figures in the painting than on colour. Most of these painters traveled to Italy as part of their training and would then take the Baroque style back to their homelands, although in some cases they remained in Italy for large portions of their career (Claude and Poussin). In Italy, the Baroque style is epitomized by religious and mythological paintings in the Grand Manner by artists such as the Carracci, Guido Reni, and Luca Giordano. Illusionistic church ceiling frescoes by Pietro da Cortona seemed to open to the sky.\nA much quieter type of Baroque emerged in the Dutch Republic, where easel paintings of everyday subjects were popular with middle-class collectors, and many painters became specialists in genre, others in landscape or seascape or still life. Vermeer, Gerard ter Borch, and Pieter de Hooch brought great technical refinement to the painting of domestic scenes, as did Willem Claesz. Heda to still life. In contrast, Rembrandt excelled in painting every type of subject, and developed an individual painterly style in which the chiaroscuro and dark backgrounds derived from Caravaggio and the Utrecht Caravaggists lose their theatrical quality. Dutch Baroque painting is often referred to as Dutch Golden Age Painting.\n\nDuring the 18th century, Rococo painting followed as a lighter extension of Baroque, often frivolous and erotic and using light pastel colours. Rococo developed first in the decorative arts and interior design in France. Louis XV's succession brought a change in the court artists and general artistic fashion. The 1730s represented the height of Rococo development in France exemplified by the works of Antoine Watteau and François Boucher. Rococo still maintained the Baroque taste for complex forms and intricate patterns, but by this point, it had begun to integrate a variety of diverse characteristics, including a taste for Oriental designs and asymmetric compositions.\n\nThe Rococo style spread with French artists and engraved publications. It was readily received in the Catholic parts of Germany, Bohemia, and Austria, where it was merged with the lively German Baroque traditions. German Rococo was applied with enthusiasm to churches and palaces, particularly in the south, while Frederician Rococo developed in the Kingdom of Prussia.\n\nThe French masters Watteau, Boucher and Fragonard represent the style, as do Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin who was considered by some as the best French painter of the 18th century – the \"Anti-Rococo\". Portraiture was an important component of painting in all countries, but especially in England, where the leaders were William Hogarth, in a blunt realist style, and Francis Hayman, Angelica Kauffman (who was Swiss), Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds in more flattering styles influenced by Anthony van Dyck. In France during the Rococo era Jean-Baptiste Greuze (the favorite painter of Denis Diderot), excelled in portraits and history paintings, and Maurice Quentin de La Tour and Élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun were highly accomplished portrait painters. La Tour specialized in pastel painting, which became a popular medium during this period.\n\nWilliam Hogarth helped develop a theoretical foundation for Rococo beauty. Though not intentionally referencing the movement, he argued in his \"Analysis of Beauty\" (1753) that the undulating lines and S-curves prominent in Rococo were the basis for grace and beauty in art or nature (unlike the straight line or the circle in Classicism). The beginning of the end for Rococo came in the early 1760s as figures like Voltaire and Jacques-François Blondel began to voice their criticism of the superficiality and degeneracy of the art. Blondel decried the \"ridiculous jumble of shells, dragons, reeds, palm-trees and plants\" in contemporary interiors.\n\nBy 1785, Rococo had passed out of fashion in France, replaced by the order and seriousness of Neoclassical artists such as Jacques-Louis David, whose imposing history paintings depicting both historical and contemporary events embodied the ideals of the French Revolution.\n\nAfter Rococo there arose in the late 18th century, in architecture, and then in painting severe neo-classicism, best represented by such artists as David and his heir Ingres. Ingres' work already contains much of the sensuality, but none of the spontaneity, that was to characterize Romanticism.\n\nBy the mid-19th century, painters became liberated from the demands of their patronage to only depict scenes from religion, mythology, portraiture or history. Art became more purely a means of personal expression in the work of painters like Francisco de Goya, John Constable, and J. M. W. Turner. Romantic painters turned landscape painting into a major genre, considered until then as a minor genre or as a decorative background for figure compositions.\nSome of the major painters of this period are Eugène Delacroix, Théodore Géricault, J. M. W. Turner, Caspar David Friedrich and John Constable. Francisco Goya's late work demonstrates the Romantic interest in the irrational, the work of Arnold Böcklin evokes mystery, the work of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in England combines assiduous devotion to nature with nostalgia for medieval culture, and the paintings of Aesthetic movement artist James Abbott McNeill Whistler evoke sophistication, decadence, and the philosophy of \"art for art's sake\". In the United States the Romantic tradition of landscape painting was known as the Hudson River School: exponents include Thomas Cole, Frederic Edwin Church, Albert Bierstadt, Thomas Moran, and John Frederick Kensett. Luminism was a movement in American landscape painting related to the Hudson River School.\n\nA major force in the turn towards Realism at mid-century was Gustave Courbet, whose unidealized paintings of common people offended viewers accustomed to the conventional subject matter and licked finish of academic art, but inspired many younger artists. The leading Barbizon School painter Jean-François Millet also painted landscapes and scenes of peasant life. Loosely associated with the Barbizon School was Camille Corot, who painted in both a romantic and a realistic vein; his work prefigures Impressionism, as did the paintings of Johan Jongkind and Eugène Boudin (who was one of the first French landscape painters to paint outdoors). Boudin was an important influence on the young Claude Monet, whom in 1857 he introduced to plein air painting.\n\nIn the latter third of the century Impressionists such as Édouard Manet, Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley, Berthe Morisot, Mary Cassatt, and Edgar Degas worked in a more direct approach than had previously been exhibited publicly. They eschewed allegory and narrative in favor of individualized responses to the modern world, sometimes painted with little or no preparatory study, relying on deftness of drawing and a highly chromatic palette. Monet, Pissarro, and Sisley used the landscape as their primary motif, the transience of light and weather playing a major role in their work. Following a practice that had become increasingly popular by mid-century, they often ventured into the countryside together to paint in the open air, but not for the traditional purpose of making sketches to be developed into carefully finished works in the studio. By painting in sunlight directly from nature, and making bold use of the vivid synthetic pigments that had become available since the beginning of the century, they developed a lighter and brighter manner of painting.\n\nManet, Degas, Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt concentrated primarily on the human subject. Both Manet and Degas reinterpreted classical figurative canons within contemporary situations; in Manet's case the re-imaginings met with hostile public reception. Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt turned to domestic life for inspiration, with Renoir focusing on the female nude. While Sisley most closely adhered to the original principals of the Impressionist perception of the landscape, Monet sought challenges in increasingly chromatic and changeable conditions, culminating in his series of monumental works of Water Lilies painted in Giverny.\n\nPost-Impressionists such as Paul Cézanne and the slightly younger Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, and Georges-Pierre Seurat led art to the edge of modernism. For Gauguin Impressionism gave way to a personal symbolism. Seurat transformed Impressionism's broken color into a scientific optical study, structured on frieze-like compositions. The painting technique he developed, called Divisionism, attracted many followers such as Paul Signac, and for a few years in the late 1880s Pissarro adopted some of his methods. Van Gogh's turbulent method of paint application, coupled with a sonorous use of color, predicted Expressionism and Fauvism, and Cézanne, desiring to unite classical composition with a revolutionary abstraction of natural forms, would come to be seen as a precursor of 20th-century art.\n\nThe spell of Impressionism was felt throughout the world, including in the United States, where it became integral to the painting of American Impressionists such as Childe Hassam, John Henry Twachtman, and Theodore Robinson. It also exerted influence on painters who were not primarily Impressionistic in theory, like the portrait and landscape painter John Singer Sargent. At the same time in America at the turn of the 20th century there existed a native and nearly insular realism, as richly embodied in the figurative work of Thomas Eakins, the Ashcan School, and the landscapes and seascapes of Winslow Homer, all of whose paintings were deeply invested in the solidity of natural forms. The visionary landscape, a motive largely dependent on the ambiguity of the nocturne, found its advocates in Albert Pinkham Ryder and Ralph Albert Blakelock.\n\nIn the late 19th century there also were several, rather dissimilar, groups of Symbolist painters whose works resonated with younger artists of the 20th century, especially with the Fauvists and the Surrealists. Among them were Gustave Moreau, Odilon Redon, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, Henri Fantin-Latour, Arnold Böcklin, Ferdinand Hodler, Edvard Munch, Félicien Rops, Jan Toorop, and Gustav Klimt, and the Russian Symbolists such as Mikhail Vrubel.\n\nSymbolist painters mined mythology and dream imagery for a visual language of the soul, seeking evocative paintings that brought to mind a static world of silence. The symbols used in Symbolism are not the familiar emblems of mainstream iconography but intensely personal, private, obscure and ambiguous references. More a philosophy than an actual style of art, the Symbolist painters influenced the contemporary Art Nouveau movement and Les Nabis. In their exploration of dreamlike subjects, symbolist painters are found across centuries and cultures, as they are still today; Bernard Delvaille has described René Magritte's surrealism as \"Symbolism plus Freud\".\n\nThe heritage of painters like Van Gogh, Cézanne, Gauguin, and Seurat was essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century Henri Matisse and several other young artists including the pre-cubist Georges Braque, André Derain, Raoul Dufy and Maurice de Vlaminck revolutionized the Paris art world with \"wild\", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called Fauvism. Henri Matisse's second version of \"The Dance\" signifies a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting. It reflects Matisse's incipient fascination with primitive art: the intense warm colors against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and hedonism. Pablo Picasso made his first cubist paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: cube, sphere and cone. With the painting \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\" (1907), Picasso created a new and radical picture depicting a brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of African tribal masks and his own Cubist inventions. Cubism was jointly developed from about 1908 through 1912 by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, whose \"Violin and Candlestick, Paris\" (1910) is shown here. The first clear manifestation of Cubism was practised by Braque, Picasso, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Fernand Léger, Henri Le Fauconnier, and Robert Delaunay. Juan Gris, Marcel Duchamp, Alexander Archipenko, Joseph Csaky and others soon joined. Synthetic cubism, practiced by Braque and Picasso, is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, collage elements, papier collé and a large variety of merged subject matter.\n\nThe Salon d'Automne of 1905 brought notoriety and attention to the works of Henri Matisse and Fauvism. The group gained their name after critic Louis Vauxcelles described their work with the phrase \"Donatello chez les fauves\" (\"Donatello among the wild beasts\"), contrasting the paintings with a Renaissance-type sculpture that shared the room with them. The jungle scene \"The Hungry Lion Throws Itself on the Antelope\" by Henri Rousseau (who was not a Fauve) hung near the works by Matisse and may have inspired the sarcastic term used in the press. Vauxcelles' comment was printed on 17 October 1905 in the daily newspaper \"Gil Blas\", and passed into popular usage.\n\nIn the first two decades of the 20th century and after cubism, several other important movements emerged; Futurism (Balla), Abstract art (Kandinsky) Der Blaue Reiter (Kandinsky and Franz Marc), Bauhaus (Kandinsky and Klee), Orphism, (Delaunay and Kupka), Synchromism (Russell), De Stijl (van Doesburg and Mondrian), Suprematism (Malevich), Constructivism (Tatlin), Dadaism (Duchamp, Picabia and Arp), and Surrealism (de Chirico, André Breton, Miró, Magritte, Dalí and Ernst). Modern painting influenced all the visual arts, from Modernist architecture and design, to avant-garde film, theatre and modern dance and became an experimental laboratory for the expression of visual experience, from photography and concrete poetry to advertising art and fashion.\n\nFauvism was a loose grouping of early 20th-century artists whose works emphasized painterly qualities, and the imaginative use of deep color over the representational values. The leaders of the movement were Henri Matisse and André Derain – friendly rivals of a sort, each with his own followers. Ultimately Matisse became the \"yang\" to Picasso's \"yin\" in the 20th century. Fauvist painters included Albert Marquet, Charles Camoin, Maurice de Vlaminck, Raoul Dufy, Othon Friesz, the Dutch painter Kees van Dongen, and Picasso's partner in Cubism, Georges Braque amongst others.\n\nFauvism had no concrete theories, and was short lived, beginning in 1905 and ending in 1907. They had only three exhibitions. Matisse was seen as the leader of the movement, due to his seniority in age and prior self-establishment in the academic art world. His 1905 portrait of Mme. Matisse, \"The Green Stripe\", caused a sensation in Paris when it was first exhibited. He said he wanted to create art to delight, and it can be said that his use of bright colors tries to maintain serenity of composition. In 1906 at the suggestion of his dealer Ambroise Vollard, André Derain went to London and produced a series of paintings including \"Charing Cross Bridge, London\" in the Fauvist style, paraphrasing the famous series by the Impressionist painter Claude Monet.\n\nBy 1907 Fauvism no longer was a shocking new movement, and Appolinaire said of Matisse in an article published in \"La Falange\", \"We are not here in the presence of an extravagant or an extremist undertaking: Matisse's art is eminently reasonable.\"\n\nDie Brücke was a group of German expressionist artists formed in Dresden in 1905. Founding members were Fritz Bleyl, Erich Heckel, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff. Later members included Max Pechstein and Otto Mueller. This seminal group had a major impact on the evolution of modern art in the 20th century and created the style of Expressionism.\n\nDer Blaue Reiter was a German movement lasting from 1911 to 1914, fundamental to Expressionism. Wassily Kandinsky, Franz Marc, August Macke, Alexej von Jawlensky, whose psychically expressive painting of the Russian dancer \"Portrait of Alexander Sakharoff\" (1909) is seen here, Marianne von Werefkin, Lyonel Feininger and others founded the Der Blaue Reiter group in response to the rejection of Kandinsky's painting \"Last Judgement\" from an exhibition. Der Blaue Reiter lacked a central artistic manifesto, but was centered around Kandinsky and Marc. Artists Gabriele Münter and Paul Klee were also involved. The name of the movement comes from a painting by Kandinsky created in 1903. For Kandinsky, \"blue\" is the color of spirituality: the darker the blue, the more it awakens human desire for the eternal.\n\n\"Expressionism\" and \"Symbolism\" are broad rubrics that involve several related movements in 20th-century painting that dominated much of the avant-garde art being made in Western, Eastern and Northern Europe. Expressionist works were painted largely between World War I and World War II, mostly in France, Germany, Norway, Russia, Belgium, and Austria. Fauvism, Die Brücke, and Der Blaue Reiter are three of the best known groups of Expressionist and Symbolist painters. Marc Chagall's painting \"I and the Village\" tells an autobiographical story that examines the relationship between the artist and his origins, with a lexicon of artistic Symbolism. Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele, Edvard Munch, Emil Nolde, Chaim Soutine, James Ensor, Oskar Kokoschka, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Max Beckmann, Franz Marc, Georges Rouault, Amedeo Modigliani, and some Americans abroad such as Marsden Hartley and Stuart Davis, were considered influential expressionist painters. Although Alberto Giacometti is primarily thought of as a Surrealist sculptor, he made intense expressionist paintings as well.\n\nAmerican painters during the period between World War I and World War II tended to go to Europe for recognition. Modernist artists like Marsden Hartley, Patrick Henry Bruce, Gerald Murphy and Stuart Davis created reputations abroad. While Patrick Henry Bruce created cubist related paintings in Europe, both Stuart Davis and Gerald Murphy made paintings that were early inspirations for American pop art and Marsden Hartley experimented with expressionism. During the 1920s photographer Alfred Stieglitz exhibited Georgia O'Keeffe, Arthur Dove, Alfred Henry Maurer, Charles Demuth, John Marin and other artists including European Masters Henri Matisse, Auguste Rodin, Henri Rousseau, Paul Cézanne, and Picasso, at his New York City gallery \"the 291\". In Europe masters like Henri Matisse and Pierre Bonnard continued developing their narrative styles independent of any movement.\n\nWassily Kandinsky is generally considered one of the first important painters of modern abstract art. As an early modernist, he theorized as did contemporary occultists and theosophists, that pure visual abstraction had corollary vibrations with sound and music. They posited that pure abstraction could express pure spirituality. His earliest abstractions were generally titled as the example in the \"Composition VII\", making connection to the work of the composers of music. Kandinsky included many of his theories about abstract art in his book \"Concerning the Spiritual in Art\". Other major pioneers of early abstraction include Swedish painter Hilma af Klint, Russian painter Kazimir Malevich, and Swiss painter Paul Klee. Robert Delaunay was a French artist who is associated with Orphism, (reminiscent of a link between pure abstraction and cubism). His key contributions to abstract painting refer to his bold use of color and his experimentation of both depth and tone.\n\nMarcel Duchamp came to international prominence in the wake of the New York City Armory Show in 1913 where his \"Nude Descending a Staircase\" became a cause célèbre. He subsequently created \"The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, Large Glass\". The \"Large Glass\" pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp (who was soon to renounce artmaking for chess) became closely associated with the Dada movement that began in neutral Zürich, Switzerland, during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design to advance its antiwar politic and rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works. Other artists associated with the Dada movement include Francis Picabia, Man Ray, Kurt Schwitters, Hannah Höch, Tristan Tzara, Hans Richter, Jean Arp, and Sophie Taeuber-Arp. Duchamp and several Dadaists are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nIn 1924 André Breton published the \"Surrealist Manifesto\". The Surrealist movement in painting became synonymous with the avant-garde and featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like \"Machine Turn Quickly\", Francis Picabia continued his involvement in the Dada movement through 1919 in Zürich and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in Surrealist art. Yves Tanguy, René Magritte and Salvador Dalí are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations of the imagination. During the 1920s André Masson's work was decisive in helping the young artist Joan Miró find his roots in Surrealist painting. Miró's \"The Tilled Field\" (1923–1924) verges on abstraction while suggesting a complex of objects and figures and arrangements of sexually active characters; it was Miró's first Surrealist masterpiece. Joan Miró, Jean Arp, André Masson, and Max Ernst were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.\n\nMax Ernst, whose 1920 painting \"Murdering Airplane\" is seen here, studied philosophy and psychology in Bonn and was interested in the alternative realities experienced by the insane. His paintings may have been inspired by the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud's study of the delusions of a paranoiac, Daniel Paul Schreber. Freud identified Schreber's fantasy of becoming a woman as a \"castration complex.\" The central image of two pairs of legs refers to Schreber's hermaphroditic desires. Ernst's inscription on the back of the painting reads: \"The picture is curious because of its symmetry. The two sexes balance one another.\"\n\nThroughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A Surrealist group developed in Britain and, according to Breton, their 1936 London International Surrealist Exhibition was a high-water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions. Surrealist groups in Japan, and especially in Latin America, the Caribbean and in Mexico produced innovative and original works. Other prominent surrealist artists include Giorgio de Chirico, Méret Oppenheim, Toyen, Grégoire Michonze, Roberto Matta, Kay Sage, Leonora Carrington, Dorothea Tanning, and Leonor Fini.\n\nDuring the 1920s and the 1930s and the Great Depression, the European art scene was characterized by Surrealism, late Cubism, the Bauhaus, De Stijl, Dada, Neue Sachlichkeit, and Expressionism; and was occupied by masterful modernist color painters like Henri Matisse and Pierre Bonnard.\n\nIn Germany Neue Sachlichkeit (\"New Objectivity\") emerged as Max Beckmann, Otto Dix, George Grosz and others politicized their paintings. The work of these artists grew out of expressionism, and was a response to the political tensions of the Weimar Republic, and was often sharply satirical.\n\nDuring the 1930s radical leftist politics characterized many of the artists connected to Surrealism, including Pablo Picasso. On 26 April 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, the Basque town of Gernika was the scene of the \"Bombing of Gernika\" by the Condor Legion of Nazi Germany's Luftwaffe. The Germans were attacking to support the efforts of Francisco Franco to overthrow the Basque Government and the Spanish Republican government. Pablo Picasso painted his mural sized \"Guernica\" to commemorate the horrors of the bombing.\n\n\"Guernica\" is an immense black-and-white, 3.5 metre (11 ft) tall and 7.8 metre (23 ft) wide mural painted in oil. The mural presents a scene of death, violence, brutality, suffering, and helplessness without portraying their immediate causes. The choice to paint in black and white invokes the immediacy of a newspaper photograph.\nThe painting was first exhibited in Paris in 1937, then Scandinavia and London, and in 1939 at Picasso's request the painting was sent to the United States in an extended loan (for safekeeping) at MoMA. Finally in accord with Picasso's wish to give the painting to the people of Spain as a gift, it was sent to Spain in 1981.\n\nFrom the Great Depression of the 1930s through the years of World War II, American art was characterized by Social Realism and American Scene Painting. Regionalism movements that contained both political and social commentary dominated the art world in the USA. Artists such as Ben Shahn, Thomas Hart Benton, Grant Wood, George Tooker, John Steuart Curry, Reginald Marsh, and others became prominent.\n\n\"American Gothic\" is a painting by Grant Wood from 1930. Portraying a pitchfork-holding farmer and a younger woman in front of a house of Carpenter Gothic style, it is one of the most familiar images in 20th-century American art. Art critics assumed it was satirical in intent; it was thought to be part of the trend towards increasingly critical depictions of rural America exemplified by Sherwood Anderson's \"1919 Winesburg, Ohio\", Sinclair Lewis' 1920 \"Main Street\", and Carl Van Vechten's \"The Tattooed Countess\" in literature. However, with the onset of the Great Depression, the painting came to be seen as a depiction of steadfast American pioneer spirit.\n\nA renaissance of the arts in Latin America included the Uruguayan painter Joaquín Torres García, the Mexican painter Rufino Tamayo, artists of the Mexican muralist movement such as Diego Rivera, David Siqueiros, José Orozco, Pedro Nel Gómez and Santiago Martinez Delgado, and the Symbolist painter Frida Kahlo. The muralists conveyed historic and political messages. Diego Rivera is perhaps best known by the public world for his 1933 mural, \"Man at the Crossroads\", in the lobby of the RCA Building at Rockefeller Center. When his patron Nelson Rockefeller discovered that the mural included a portrait of Lenin and other communist imagery, he fired Rivera, and the unfinished work was eventually destroyed by Rockefeller's staff.\n\nFrida Kahlo's works relate to Surrealism and to the Magic Realism movement in literature. Her works are often characterized by their stark portrayals of pain. Of her 143 paintings 55 are self-portraits, which frequently incorporate symbolic portrayals of her physical and psychological wounds.\n\nThe 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American abstract expressionism, a movement that combined lessons learned from European Modernists via great teachers in America like Hans Hofmann and John D. Graham. American artists benefited from the presence of Piet Mondrian, Fernand Léger, Max Ernst and the André Breton group, Pierre Matisse's gallery, and Peggy Guggenheim's gallery \"The Art of This Century\", as well as other factors.\nPost-Second World War American painting called Abstract expressionism included artists like Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Arshile Gorky, Mark Rothko, Hans Hofmann, Clyfford Still, Franz Kline, Adolph Gottlieb, Barnett Newman, Mark Tobey, James Brooks, Philip Guston, Robert Motherwell, Conrad Marca-Relli, Jack Tworkov, Esteban Vicente, William Baziotes, Richard Pousette-Dart, Ad Reinhardt, Hedda Sterne, Jimmy Ernst, Bradley Walker Tomlin, and Theodoros Stamos, among others. American Abstract expressionism got its name in 1946 from the art critic Robert Coates.\nAbstract expressionism, Action painting, and Color Field painting are synonymous with the New York School.\n\nTechnically Surrealism was an important predecessor for Abstract expressionism with its emphasis on spontaneous, automatic or subconscious creation. Jackson Pollock's dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of André Masson. Another important ear<nowiki>ly m</nowiki>anifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist Mark Tobey, especially his \"white writing\" canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the \"all over\" look of Pollock's drip paintings.\n\nAdditionally, Abstract expressionism has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, rather nihilistic. In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even applied to work which is not especially abstract nor expressionist. Pollock's energetic \"action paintings\", with their \"busy\" feel, are different both technically and aesthetically, to the violent and grotesque \"Women\" series of Willem de Kooning. Woman V is one of a series of six paintings made by de Kooning between 1950 and 1953 that depict a three-quarter-length female figure. He began the first of these paintings, Woman I, in June 1950, repeatedly changing and painting out the image until January or February 1952, when the painting was abandoned unfinished. The art historian Meyer Schapiro saw the painting in de Kooning's studio and encouraged the artist to persist. De Kooning's response was to begin three other paintings on the same theme; Woman II, Woman III, and Woman IV. During the summer of 1952, spent at East Hampton, de Kooning further explored the theme through drawings and pastels. He finished work on Woman I by November 1952, and probably the other three women pictures were concluded at much the same time. The \"Woman series\" are decidedly figurative paintings. Another important artist is Franz Kline, as demonstrated by his painting \"High Street\" (1950), who was labelled an action painter because of his seemingly spontaneous and intense style, focusing less, or not at all, on figures or imagery, but on the actual brush strokes and use of canvas.\n\nClyfford Still, Barnett Newman, Adolph Gottlieb, and the serenely shimmering blocks of color in Mark Rothko's work (which is not what would usually be called expressionist and which Rothko denied was abstract), are classified as abstract expressionists, albeit from what Clement Greenberg termed the Color field direction of abstract expressionism. Both Hans Hofmann and Robert Motherwell can be described as practitioners of action painting and Color field painting.\n\nDuring the 1950s \"Color Field painting\" initially referred to a particular type of abstract expressionism, especially the work of Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, Robert Motherwell and Adolph Gottlieb. It essentially involved abstract paintings with large, flat expanses of color that expressed the sensual, and visual feelings and properties of large areas of nuanced surface. Art critic Clement Greenberg perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from Action painting. The overall expanse and gestalt of the work of the early color field painters speaks of an almost religious experience, awestruck in the face of an expanding universe of sensuality, color and surface. During the early-to-mid-1960s \"Color Field painting\" came to refer to the styles of artists like Jules Olitski, Kenneth Noland, and Helen Frankenthaler, whose works were related to second-generation abstract expressionism, and to younger artists like Larry Zox, and Frank Stella – all moving in a new direction.\n\nDuring the 1930s through the 1960s as abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as abstract expressionism, Color Field painting, Post-painterly Abstraction, Op art, hard-edge painting, Minimal art, shaped canvas painting, and Lyrical Abstraction. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction allowing imagery to continue through various new contexts like the Bay Area Figurative Movement in the 1950s and new forms of expressionism from the 1940s through the 1960s. Throughout the 20th century many painters practiced Realism and used expressive imagery in landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects. They include artists as varied as Milton Avery, John D. Graham, Fairfield Porter, Edward Hopper, Andrew Wyeth, Balthus, Francis Bacon, Frank Auerbach, Lucian Freud, Leon Kossoff, Philip Pearlstein, Willem de Kooning, Arshile Gorky, Grace Hartigan, Robert De Niro, Sr., and Elaine de Kooning.\n\nIn Italy during this time, Giorgio Morandi was the foremost still-life painter, exploring a wide variety of approaches to depicting everyday bottles and kitchen implements.\nArshile Gorky's portrait of Willem de Kooning is an example of the evolution of abstract expressionism from the context of figure painting, cubism and surrealism. Along with his friends de Kooning and John D. Graham Gorky created bio-morphically shaped and abstracted figurative compositions that by the 1940s evolved into totally abstract paintings. Gorky's work seems to be a careful analysis of memory, emotion and shape, using line and color to express feeling and nature.\n\n\"Study after Velázquez's Portrait of Pope Innocent X\", 1953 is a painting by the Irish-born artist Francis Bacon and is an example of Post World War II European Expressionism. The work shows a distorted version of the Portrait of Innocent X painted by the Spanish artist Diego Velázquez in 1650. The work is one of a series of variants of the Velázquez painting which Bacon executed throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, over a total of forty-five works. When asked why he was compelled to revisit the subject so often, Bacon replied that he had nothing against the Popes, that he merely \"wanted an excuse to use these colours, and you can't give ordinary clothes that purple colour without getting into a sort of false fauve manner.\" The Pope in this version seethes with anger and aggression, and the dark colors give the image a grotesque and nightmarish appearance. The pleated curtains of the backdrop are rendered transparent, and seem to fall through the Pope's face.\n\nThe figurative work of Francis Bacon, Frida Kahlo, Edward Hopper, Lucian Freud, Andrew Wyeth and others served as a kind of alternative to abstract expressionism. \"Nighthawks\" (1942) is a realist painting by Edward Hopper that portrays people sitting in a downtown diner late at night. It is not only Hopper's most famous painting, but one of the most recognizable in American art. The urban street is empty outside the diner, and inside none of the three patrons is apparently looking or talking to the others but instead is lost in their own thoughts. This portrayal of modern urban life as empty or lonely is a common theme throughout Hopper's work. One of the most well-known images in 20th-century American art is Wyeth's tempera painting, \"Christina's World\", in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. It depicts a woman lying on the ground in a treeless, mostly tawny field, looking up at and crawling towards a gray house on the horizon; a barn and various other small outbuildings are adjacent to the house.\n\nAfter World War II the term School of Paris often referred to Tachisme, the European equivalent of American Abstract expressionism and those artists are also related to Cobra. Important proponents being Jean Dubuffet, Pierre Soulages, Nicolas de Staël, Hans Hartung, Serge Poliakoff, and Georges Mathieu, among several others. During the early 1950s Dubuffet (who was always a figurative artist) and de Staël abandoned abstraction, and returned to imagery via figuration and landscape. De Staël's return to representation (seascapes, footballers, jazz musicians, seagulls) during the early 1950s can be seen as an influential precedent for the American Bay Area Figurative Movement, as many of those abstract painters like Richard Diebenkorn, David Park, Elmer Bischoff, Wayne Thiebaud, Nathan Oliveira, Joan Brown and others made a similar move; returning to imagery during the mid-1950s. Much of de Staël's late work – in particular his abstract landscapes of the mid-1950s – predicts Color Field painting and Lyrical Abstraction of the 1960s and 1970s. Milton Avery as well through his use of color and his interest in seascape and landscape paintings connected with the Color field aspect of Abstract expressionism as manifested by Adolph Gottlieb and Mark Rothko as well as the lessons American painters took from the work of Henri Matisse.\n\nPop art in America was to a large degree initially inspired by the works of Jasper Johns, Larry Rivers, and Robert Rauschenberg, although the paintings of Gerald Murphy, Stuart Davis and Charles Demuth during the 1920s and 1930s foreshadow the style and subject matter of Pop art. \n\nIn New York City during the mid-1950s, Rauschenberg and Johns created works of art that at first seemed to be continuations of Abstract expressionist painting. Actually their works, and the work of Larry Rivers, were radical departures from abstract expressionism especially in the use of banal and literal imagery and the inclusion of mundane materials into their work. Johns' use of various images and objects like chairs, numbers, targets, beer cans and the American Flag; Rivers' paintings of subjects drawn from popular culture such as George Washington crossing the Delaware, and his inclusions of images from advertisements like the camel from Camel cigarettes; and Rauschenberg's surprising constructions using inclusions of objects and pictures taken from popular culture, hardware stores, junkyards, the city streets, and taxidermy, gave rise to a radical new movement in American art. Eventually by 1963 the movement came to be known worldwide as Pop art.\n\nPop art is exemplified by the artists Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, Wayne Thiebaud, James Rosenquist, Jim Dine, Tom Wesselmann and Roy Lichtenstein among others. Lichtenstein used oil and Magna paint in works such as \"Drowning Girl\" (1963; Museum of Modern Art, New York), which was appropriated from the lead story in DC Comics' \"Secret Hearts\" #83.) Thick outlines, bold colors and Ben-Day dots reproduce the appearance of commercial printing. Lichtenstein would say of his own work: Abstract Expressionists \"put things down on the canvas and responded to what they had done, to the color positions and sizes. My style looks completely different, but the nature of putting down lines pretty much is the same; mine just don't come out looking calligraphic, like Pollock's or Kline's.\" Pop art merges popular and mass culture with fine art, while injecting humor, irony, and recognizable imagery and content into the mix. In October 1962 the Sidney Janis Gallery mounted \"The New Realists\", the first major Pop art group exhibition in an uptown art gallery in New York City. The show sent shockwaves through the New York School and reverberated worldwide. \"Campbell's Soup Cans\" (sometimes referred to as \"32 Campbell's Soup Cans\") is the title of an Andy Warhol work of art that was produced in 1962. It consists of thirty-two canvases of equal size, each consisting of a painting of a Campbell's Soup can—one of each canned soup variety the company offered at the time. The individual paintings were produced with a semi-mechanised silkscreen process, using a non-painterly style. They helped usher in Pop art as a major art movement that relied on themes from popular culture.\n\nEarlier in England in 1956 the term \"Pop Art\" was used by Lawrence Alloway for paintings that celebrated consumerism of the post World War II era. This movement rejected Abstract expressionism and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior, in favor of art which depicted material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age. The early works of English artist David Hockney, such as \"A Bigger Splash\", and the works of Richard Hamilton, Peter Blake, and Eduardo Paolozzi, are considered seminal examples in the movement.\nIn New York's East Village 10th Street galleries artists were formulating an American version of Pop art. Claes Oldenburg had his storefront, and the Green Gallery on 57th Street began to show Tom Wesselmann and James Rosenquist. There is a connection between the radical works of Duchamp, and Man Ray, the rebellious Dadaists – with a sense of humor; and Pop Artists like Alex Katz, Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and the others.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s as abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as Color Field painting, Post painterly abstraction, Op art, hard-edge painting, Minimal art, shaped canvas painting, Lyrical Abstraction, and the continuation of Abstract expressionism. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction with Art brut, as seen in \"Court les rues,\" 1962, by Jean Dubuffet, Fluxus, Neo-Dada, New Realism, Photorealism, allowing imagery to re-emerge through various new contexts like Pop art, the Bay Area Figurative Movement (a prime example is Diebenkorn's \"Cityscape I,(Landscape No. 1)\" (1963), and later in the 1970s Neo-expressionism. The Bay Area Figurative Movement of whom David Park, Elmer Bischoff, Nathan Oliveira and Richard Diebenkorn whose painting \"Cityscape 1\" (1963) is a typical example, were influential members flourished during the 1950s and 1960s in California. Younger painters practiced the use of imagery in new and radical ways. Yves Klein, Arman, Martial Raysse, Christo, Niki de Saint Phalle, David Hockney, Alex Katz, Malcolm Morley, Ralph Goings, Audrey Flack, Richard Estes, Chuck Close, Susan Rothenberg, Eric Fischl, and Vija Celmins were a few who became prominent between the 1960s and the 1980s. Fairfield Porter was largely self-taught, and produced representational work in the midst of the Abstract Expressionist movement. His subjects were primarily landscapes, domestic interiors and portraits of family, friends and fellow artists.\n\nAlso during the 1960s and 1970s, there was a reaction against painting. Critics like Douglas Crimp viewed the work of artists like Ad Reinhardt, and declared the \"death of painting\". Artists began to practice new ways of making art. New movements gained prominence some of which are: Fluxus, Happening, Video art, Installation art Mail art, the situationists, Conceptual art, Postminimalism, Earth art, arte povera, performance art and body art among others.\n\nNeo-Dada is also a movement that started in the 1950s and 1960s and was related to Abstract expressionism only with imagery. This trend, in which manufactured items are combined with artist materials, is exemplified by the work of Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg. Rauschenberg's \"combines\" in the 1950s were forerunners of Pop Art and Installation art, and made use of the assemblage of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and commercial photography. Rauschenberg, Johns, Larry Rivers, John Chamberlain, Claes Oldenburg, George Segal, Jim Dine, and Edward Kienholz among others created new conventions of art-making; they made acceptable in serious contemporary art circles the radical inclusion of unlikely materials as parts of their works of art.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s abstract painting continued to develop in America through varied styles. Geometric abstraction, Op art, hard-edge painting, Color Field painting and minimal painting, were some interrelated directions for advanced abstract painting as well as some other new movements. Morris Louis was an important pioneer in advanced Colorfield painting, his work can serve as a bridge between Abstract expressionism, Colorfield painting, and Minimal Art. Two influential teachers, Josef Albers and Hans Hofmann, introduced a new generation of American artists to their advanced theories of color and space. Albers is best remembered for his work as a Geometric abstractionist painter and theorist. Most famous of all are the hundreds of paintings and prints that make up the series \"Homage to the Square\". In this rigorous series, begun in 1949, Albers explored chromatic interactions with flat colored squares arranged concentrically on the canvas. Albers' theories on art and education were formative for the next generation of artists. His own paintings form the foundation of both hard-edge painting and Op art.\n\nJosef Albers, Hans Hofmann, Ilya Bolotowsky, Burgoyne Diller, Victor Vasarely, Bridget Riley, Richard Anuszkiewicz, Frank Stella, Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland, Ellsworth Kelly, John McLaughlin, Barnett Newman, Larry Poons, Ronald Davis, John Hoyland, Larry Zox, Al Held, Mino Argento are artists closely associated with Geometric abstraction, Op art, Color Field painting, and in the case of Hofmann and Newman Abstract expressionism as well. Agnes Martin, Robert Mangold, Brice Marden, Jo Baer, Robert Ryman, Richard Tuttle, Neil Williams, David Novros, Paul Mogenson, are examples of artists associated with Minimalism and (exceptions of Martin, Baer and Marden) the use of the shaped canvas also during the period beginning in the early 1960s. Many Geometric abstract artists, minimalists, and Hard-edge painters elected to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the shaped canvas is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly abstract, formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or minimalist in character. The Bykert Gallery, and the Park Place Gallery were important showcases for Minimalism and shaped canvas painting in New York City during the 1960s.\n\nColor Field painting pointed toward a new direction in American painting, away from abstract expressionism. Related to Post-painterly abstraction, Suprematism, Abstract Expressionism, Hard-edge painting and Lyrical Abstraction, Color Field painting sought to rid art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like Clyfford Still, Mark Rothko, Hans Hofmann, Morris Louis, Jules Olitski, Kenneth Noland, Helen Frankenthaler, Larry Zox, and others painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. Certain artists made references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of modern art, artists wanted to present each painting as one cohesive, monolithic image. Gene Davis along with Kenneth Noland, Morris Louis and several others was a member of the Washington Color School painters who began to create Color Field paintings in Washington, D.C. during the 1950s and 1960s, \"Black, Grey, Beat\" is a large vertical stripe painting and typical of Gene Davis's work.\nFrank Stella, Kenneth Noland, Ellsworth Kelly, Barnett Newman, Ronald Davis, Neil Williams, Robert Mangold, Charles Hinman, Richard Tuttle, David Novros, and Al Loving are examples of artists associated with the use of the shaped canvas during the period beginning in the early 1960s.\n\nFrom 1960 Frank Stella produced paintings in aluminum and copper paint and his first works using shaped canvases (canvases in a shape other than the traditional rectangle or square), often being in L, N, U or T-shapes. These later developed into more elaborate designs, in the \"Irregular Polygon\" series (1967), for example. Later he began his \"Protractor Series\" (1971) of paintings, in which arcs, sometimes overlapping, within square borders are arranged side-by-side to produce full and half circles painted in rings of concentric color. \"Harran II,\" 1967, is an example of the \"Protractor Series\".\n\nThe Andre Emmerich Gallery, the Leo Castelli Gallery, the Richard Feigen Gallery, and the Park Place Gallery were important showcases for Color Field painting, shaped canvas painting and Lyrical Abstraction in New York City during the 1960s. There is a connection with post-painterly abstraction, which reacted against abstract expressionisms' mysticism, hyper-subjectivity, and emphasis on making the act of painting itself dramatically visible – as well as the solemn acceptance of the flat rectangle as an almost ritual prerequisite for serious painting. During the 1960s Color Field painting and Minimal art were often closely associated with each other. In actuality by the early 1970s both movements became decidedly diverse.\n\nLyrical Abstraction (the term being coined by Larry Aldrich, the founder of the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, Ridgefield Connecticut), encompassed what Aldrich said he saw in the studios of many artists at that time. It is also the name of an exhibition that originated in the Aldrich Museum and traveled to the Whitney Museum of American Art and other museums throughout the United States between 1969 and 1971. Lyrical Abstraction is a type of freewheeling abstract painting that emerged in the mid-1960s when abstract painters returned to various forms of painterly, pictorial, expressionism with a predominate focus on process, gestalt and repetitive compositional strategies in general. In contrast to Action Painting, where emphasis is on brushstrokes and high compositional drama, in Lyrical Abstraction—as exemplified by the 1971 Ronnie Landfield painting \"Garden of Delight\"—there is a sense of compositional randomness, relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility. Lyrical Abstraction in the late 1960s is characterized by the paintings of Dan Christensen, Ronnie Landfield, Peter Young and others, and along with the Fluxus movement and Postminimalism (a term first coined by Robert Pincus-Witten in the pages of Artforum in 1969) sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting and Minimalism by focusing on process, new materials and new ways of expression. Postminimalism often incorporating industrial materials, raw materials, fabrications, found objects, installation, serial repetition, and often with references to Dada and Surrealism is best exemplified in the sculptures of Eva Hesse. Lyrical Abstraction, Conceptual Art, Postminimalism, Earth Art, Video, Performance art, Installation art, along with the continuation of Fluxus, Abstract Expressionism, Color Field painting, Hard-edge painting, Minimal Art, Op art, Pop art, Photorealism and New Realism extended the boundaries of Contemporary Art in the mid-1960s through the 1970s.\n\nOne of the first artists specifically associated with Minimalism was Frank Stella, whose early \"stripe\" paintings were highlighted in the 1959 show, \"16 Americans\", organized by Dorothy Miller at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The widths of the stripes in Stella's stripe paintings were not entirely subjective, but were determined by the dimensions of the lumber used to construct the supportive chassis upon which the canvas was stretched. In the show catalog, Carl Andre noted, \"Art excludes the unnecessary. Frank Stella has found it necessary to paint stripes. There is nothing else in his painting.\" These reductive works were in sharp contrast to the energy-filled and apparently emotionally charged paintings of Willem de Kooning or Franz Kline and leaned more toward less gestural coloristic field paintings of Barnett Newman and Mark Rothko.\n\nArtists such as Larry Poons—whose work related to Op Art with his emphasis on dots, ovals and after-images bouncing across color fields—Kenneth Noland, Ralph Humphrey, Robert Motherwell and Robert Ryman had also begun to explore stripes, monochromatic and Hard-edge formats from the late 1950s through the 1960s.\n\nBecause of a tendency in Minimalism to exclude the pictorial, illusionistic and fictive in favor of the literal—as demonstrated by Robert Mangold, who understood the concept of the shape of the canvas and its relationship to \"objecthood\"—there was a movement away from painterly and toward sculptural concerns. Donald Judd had started as a painter, and ended as a creator of objects. His seminal essay, \"Specific Objects\" (published in Arts Yearbook 8, 1965), was a touchstone of theory for the formation of Minimalist aesthetics. In this essay, Judd found a starting point for a new territory for American art, and a simultaneous rejection of residual inherited European artistic values. He pointed to evidence of this development in the works of an array of artists active in New York at the time, including Jasper Johns, Dan Flavin and Lee Bontecou. Of \"preliminary\" importance for Judd was the work of George Earl Ortman , who had concretized and distilled painting's forms into blunt, tough, philosophically charged geometries. These Specific Objects inhabited a space not then comfortably classifiable as either painting or sculpture. That the categorical identity of such objects was itself in question, and that they avoided easy association with well-worn and over-familiar conventions, was a part of their value for Judd.\n\nIn a much more general sense, one might find European roots of Minimalism in the geometric abstractions painters in the Bauhaus, in the works of Piet Mondrian and other artists associated with the movement DeStijl, in Russian Constructivists and in the work of the Romanian sculptor Constantin Brâncuși. American painters such as Brice Marden and Cy Twombly show a clear European influence in their \"pure\" abstraction, minimalist painting of the 1960s. Ronald Davis polyurethane works from the late 1960s pay homage to the \"Broken Glass\" of Marcel Duchamp\".\nThis movement was heavily criticised by high modernist formalist art critics and historians. Some anxious critics thought Minimalist art represented a misunderstanding of the modern dialectic of painting and sculpture as defined by critic Clement Greenberg, arguably the dominant American critic of painting in the period leading up to the 1960s. The most notable critique of Minimalism was produced by Michael Fried, a Greenbergian critic, who objected to the work on the basis of its \"theatricality\". In \"Art and Objecthood\" (published in Artforum in June 1967) he declared that the Minimalist work of art, particularly Minimalist sculpture, was based on an engagement with the physicality of the spectator. He argued that work like Robert Morris's transformed the act of viewing into a type of spectacle, in which the artifice of the act observation and the viewer's participation in the work were unveiled. Fried saw this displacement of the viewer's experience from an aesthetic engagement within, to an event outside of the artwork as a failure of Minimal art.\n\nAd Reinhardt, actually an artist of the Abstract Expressionist generation, but one whose reductive all-black paintings seemed to anticipate minimalism, had this to say about the value of a reductive approach to art: \"The more stuff in it, the busier the work of art, the worse it is. More is less. Less is more. The eye is a menace to clear sight. The laying bare of oneself is obscene. Art begins with the getting rid of nature.\"\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s artists as powerful and influential as Adolph Gottlieb, Phillip Guston, Lee Krasner, Richard Diebenkorn, Elmer Bischoff, Agnes Martin, Sam Francis, Gene Davis, Joan Mitchell, Friedel Dzubas, and younger artists like Sam Gilliam, Sean Scully, Pat Steir, Elizabeth Murray, Walter Darby Bannard, Dan Christensen, Joan Snyder, Richard Tuttle, Ross Bleckner, Archie Rand, Susan Crile, and dozens of others produced vital and influential paintings.\n\nStill other important innovations in abstract painting took place during the 1960s and the 1970s characterized by Monochrome painting and Hard-edge painting inspired by Ad Reinhardt, Barnett Newman, Milton Resnick, and Ellsworth Kelly. Artists as diversified as Al Held, Larry Zox, Frank Stella, Larry Poons, Brice Marden and others explored the power of simplification. The convergence of Color Field painting, Minimal art, Hard-edge painting, Lyrical Abstraction, and Postminimalism blurred the distinction between movements that became more apparent in the 1980s and 1990s. The Neo-expressionism movement is related to earlier developments in Abstract expressionism, Neo-Dada, Lyrical Abstraction and Postminimal painting.\n\nIn the late 1960s the abstract expressionist painter Philip Guston helped to lead a transition from abstract expressionism to Neo-expressionism in painting, abandoning the so-called \"pure abstraction\" of abstract expressionism in favor of more cartoonish renderings of various personal symbols and objects. These works were inspirational to a new generation of painters interested in a revival of expressive imagery. His painting \"Painting, Smoking, Eating\" is an example of Guston's return to representation.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was also a return to painting that occurred almost simultaneously in Italy, Germany, France and Britain. These movements were called Transavantguardia, Neue Wilde, Figuration Libre, Neo-expressionism, the school of London, and in the late 80s the Stuckists respectively. These painting were characterized by large formats, free expressive mark making, figuration, myth and imagination. All work in this genre came to be labeled neo-expressionism.\n\nNeo-expressionism was a style of modern painting that became popular in the late 1970s and dominated the art market until the mid-1980s. It developed in Europe as a reaction against the conceptual and minimalistic art of the 1960s and 1970s. Neo-expressionists returned to portraying recognizable objects, such as the human body (although sometimes in a virtually abstract manner) in a rough and violently emotional way using vivid colors and banal color harmonies. The veteran painters Philip Guston, Frank Auerbach, Leon Kossoff, Gerhard Richter, A. R. Penck and Georg Baselitz, along with the slightly younger artists Damien Hirst, Anselm Kiefer, the Americans Eric Fischl, Susan Rothenberg, David Salle, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Julian Schnabel, and Keith Haring, the Italians Francesco Clemente, Mimmo Paladino, Sandro Chia, and Enzo Cucchi, and many others became known for working in this intense expressionist vein of painting. Critical reaction was divided. Some critics regarded it as driven by profit motivations by large commercial galleries.\n\nAnselm Kiefer is a leading figure in European Neo-expressionism. By the 1980s, Kiefer's themes widened from a focus on Germany's role in civilization to the fate of art and culture in general. His work became more sculptural and involves not only national identity and collective memory, but also occult symbolism, theology and mysticism. The theme of all the work is the trauma experienced by entire societies, and the continual rebirth and renewal in life.\nPainting still holds a respected position in contemporary art. Art is an open field no longer divided by the objective versus non-objective dichotomy. Artists can achieve critical success whether their images are representational or abstract. What has currency is content, exploring the boundaries of the medium, and a refusal to recapitulate the works of the past as an end goal.\n\nThroughout the 20th century and into the 21st century, with the advent of Modern and Postmodern art forms, distinctions between what is generally regarded as the fine arts and the low arts have started to fade, as contemporary high art continues to challenge these concepts by mixing with popular culture.\n\nMainstream painting has been rejected by artists of the postmodern era in favor of artistic pluralism. According to art critic Arthur Danto there is an \"anything goes\" attitude that prevails; an \"everything going on\", and consequently \"nothing going on\" syndrome; this creates an aesthetic traffic jam with no firm and clear direction and with every lane on the artistic superhighway filled to capacity.\n\n\nOn the effects of Gutenberg's printing\n\n"}
