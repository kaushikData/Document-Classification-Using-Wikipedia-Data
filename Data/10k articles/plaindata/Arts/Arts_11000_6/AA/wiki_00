{"id": "2489165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2489165", "title": "Apadana", "text": "Apadana\n\nApadana () is a large hypostyle hall, best said the great audience hall and portico at Persepolis and the palace of Susa. The Persepolis Apadana belongs to the oldest building phase of the city of Persepolis, the first half of the 6th century BC, as part of the original design by Darius the Great. Its construction completed by Xerxes I. Modern scholarships \"demonstrates the metaphorical nature of the Apadana reliefs as idealised social orders\".\n\nAs a word, \"apadƒÅna\" (Old Persianêé†êé±êé≠êé†êé¥, masc.) is used to designate a hypostyle hall, i.e., a palace or audience hall of stone construction with columns. The word is rendered in Elamite as \"ha-ha-da-na\" and in Babylonian \"ap-pa-da-an\" is etymologically ambiguous. It has been compared to the Sanskrit \"apadana\" ( ‡§Ü‡§™‡§æ‡§¶‡§®) which means 'to arrive at', and also to the Sanskrit \"apa-dhƒÅ\" ( ‡§Ö‡§™‡§ß‡§æ) which means \"a hide-out or concealment\", and the Greek \"apo-thƒìkƒì\" \"storehouse\". The word survived into later periods in Iran, as the Parthian 'pdn(y) or 'pdnk(y) \"palace\", and outside Iran it still survives in several languages as loan-words (including the Arabic \"fadan\", the Armenian \"aparan-k ø\" \"palace\".)\n\nMore precisely, however, this word is the direct ancestor of the medieval and modern architectural term, ayvan/aywan. The Old Persian term êé†êé±êé≠êé†êé¥, a-pad-an, standing for \"unprotected\", refers to the fact that the veranda-shaped structure is open to the outside elements on one of its four sides, and thus 'unprotected' / exposed to the natural elements. This is exactly what the Apadana palace has: open (columned) verandas on three sides‚Äîa unique feature among all palace buildings at Persepolis. The Parthian and Sasanian architects largely did away with the columns holding up the ceiling of the veranda, replacing them with a barrel vaulting, such as the famous Ayvan of Kisra at Ctesiphon. The later evolution of term into aywan in the post-Islamic architecture that evolved from the old \"apadana\", refers to both columned (such as the palace of Chehel Sotoun, Isfahan) or barrel vaulted (all the four-aywaned mosques). Like the old Apadana, the new aywans are also verandas: open to the natural elements on one side.\n\nAs a modern architectural and archaeological term, the word \"apadana\" is also used to refer to Urartian hypostyle halls, such as those excavated at Altintepe and Erebuni. These halls predate those from Persia, and it has been proposed that Urartu could be the stylistic origin of the later Persian hypostyle audience halls.\n\nThe Apadana was the largest building on the Terrace at Persepolis and was excavated by the German archaeologist Ernst Herzfeld and his assistant Friedrich Krefter, and Erich Schmidt, between 1931 and 1939. Important material relevant to the excavations are today housed in the archives of the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington, DC.\n\nIt was most likely the main hall of the kings. The columns reached 20m high and had complex capitals in the shape of bulls or lions. Here, the great king received the tribute from all the nations in the Achaemenid Empire, and gave presents in return.\n\nAccess to the hall is given by two monumental stairways, on the north and on the east. These are decorated by reliefs, showing delegates of the 23 subject nations of the Persian Empire paying tribute to Darius I, who is represented seated centrally. The various delegates are shown in great detail, giving insight into the costume and equipment of the various peoples of Persia in the 5th century BC. There are inscriptions in Old Persian and Elamite.\n\nThe Apadana at Persepolis has a surface of 1000 square metres; its roof was supported by 72 columns, each 24 metres tall. The entire hall was destroyed in 331 BC by the army of Alexander the Great. Stones from the columns were used as building material for nearby settlements. By the start of the 20th century, only 13 of these giant columns were still standing. The re-erecting of a complete, but fallen column in the 1970s, is now the 14th standing column of the Apadana.\n\nThe Apadana in Susa was‚Äîlike the city itself‚Äîlargely abandoned, and pillaged for building material.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9410290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9410290", "title": "Art in the Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation", "text": "Art in the Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation\n\nThe Protestant Reformation during the 16th century in Europe almost entirely rejected the existing tradition of Catholic art, and very often destroyed as much of it as it could reach. A new artistic tradition developed, producing far smaller quantities of art that followed Protestant agendas and diverged drastically from the southern European tradition and the humanist art produced during the High Renaissance. The Lutheran churches, as they developed, accepted a limited role for larger works of art in churches, and also encouraged prints and book illustrations. Calvinists remained steadfastly opposed to art in churches, and suspicious of small printed images of religious subjects, though generally fully accepting secular images in their homes. \n\nIn turn, the Catholic Counter-Reformation both reacted against and responded to Protestant criticisms of art in Roman Catholicism to produce a more stringent style of Catholic art. Protestant religious art both embraced Protestant values and assisted in the proliferation of Protestantism, but the amount of religious art produced in Protestant countries was hugely reduced. Artists in Protestant countries diversified into secular forms of art like history painting, landscape painting, portrait painting and still life.\n\nThe Protestant Reformation was a religious movement that occurred in Western Europe during the 16th century that resulted in a divide in Christianity between Roman Catholics and Protestants. This movement \"created a North-South split in Europe, where generally Northern countries became Protestant, while Southern countries remained Catholic.\"\n\nThe Reformation produced two main branches of Protestantism; one was the Evangelical Lutheran churches, which followed the teachings of Martin Luther, and the other the Reformed Churches, which followed the ideas of John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli. Out of these branches grew three main sects, the Lutheran tradition, as well as the Continental Reformed and Anglican traditions, the latter two following the Reformed (Calvinist) faith. Lutherans and Reformed Christians had different views regarding religious imagery.\n\nMartin Luther in Germany allowed and encouraged the display of a restricted range of religious imagery in churches, seeing the Evangelical Lutheran Church as a continuation of the \"ancient, apostolic church\". The use of images was one of the issues where Luther strongly opposed the more radical Andreas Karlstadt. For a few years Lutheran altarpieces like the \"Last Supper\" by the younger Cranach were produced in Germany, especially by Luther's friend Lucas Cranach, to replace Catholic ones, often containing portraits of leading reformers as the apostles or other protagonists, but retaining the traditional depiction of Jesus. As such, \"Lutheran worship became a complex ritual choreography set in a richly furnished church interior.\" Lutherans proudly employed the use of the crucifix as it highlighted their high view of the Theology of the Cross. Stories grew up of \"indestructible\" images of Luther, that had survived fires, by divine intervention. Thus, for Lutherans, \"the Reformation renewed rather than removed the religious image.\"\n\nOn the other hand there was a wave of iconoclasm, or the destruction of religious imagery. This began very early in the Reformation, when students in Erfurt destroyed a wooden altar in the Franciscan friary in December 1521. Later, Reformed Christianity showed consistent hostility to religious images, as idolatry, especially sculpture and large paintings. Book illustrations and prints were more acceptable, because they were smaller and more private. Reformed leaders, especially Huldrych Zwingli and John Calvin, actively eliminated imagery from churches within the control of their followers, and regarded the great majority of religious images as idolatrous. The destruction was often extremely divisive and traumatic within communities, an unmistakable physical manifestation, often imposed from above, that could not be ignored. It was just for this reason that reformers favoured a single dramatic \"coup\", and many premature acts in this line sharply increased subsequent hostility between Catholics and Calvinists in communities for it was generally at the level of the city, town or village that such actions occurred, except in England and Scotland. \n\nBut reformers often felt impelled by strong personal convictions, as shown by the case of Frau G√∂ldli, on which Zwingli was asked to advise. She was a Swiss lady who had once made a promise to Saint Apollinaris that if she recovered from an illness she would donate an image of the saint to a local convent, which she did. Later she turned Protestant, and feeling she must reverse what she now saw as a wrong action, she went to the convent church, removed the statue and burnt it. Prosecuted for blasphemy, she paid a small fine without complaint, but flatly refused to pay the additional sum the court ordered be paid to the convent to replace the statue, putting her at risk of serious penalties. Zwingli's letter advised trying to pay the nuns a larger sum on condition they did not replace the statue, but the eventual outcome is unknown. By the end of his life, after iconoclastic shows of force became a feature of the early phases of the French Wars of Religion, even Calvin became alarmed and criticised them, realizing that they had become counter-productive. \nSubjects prominent in Catholic art other than Jesus and events in the Bible, such as Mary and saints were given much less emphasis or disapproved of in Protestant theology. As a result, in much of northern Europe, the Church virtually ceased to commission figurative art, placing the dictation of content entirely in the hands of the artists and lay consumers. Calvinism even objected to non-religious funerary art, such as the heraldry and effigies beloved of the Renaissance rich. Where there was religious art, iconic images of Christ and scenes from the Passion became less frequent, as did portrayals of the saints and clergy. Narrative scenes from the Bible, especially as book illustrations and prints, and, later, moralistic depictions of modern life were preferred. Both Cranachs painted allegorical scenes setting out Lutheran doctrines, in particular a series on \"Law and Gospel\". Daniel Hisgen, a German Rococo painter of the 18th century in Upper Hesse, specialized in cycles of biblical paintings decorating the front of the gallery parapet in Lutheran churches with an upper gallery, a less prominent position that satisfied Lutheran scruples. Wooden organ cases were also often painted with similar scenes to those in Catholic churches.\n\nLutherans strongly defended their existing sacred art from a new wave of Calvinist-on-Lutheran iconoclasm in the second half of the century, as Calvinist rulers or city authorities attempted to impose their will on Lutheran populations in the \"Second Reformation\" of about 1560-1619. Against the Reformed, Lutherans exclaimed: \"You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return\". The Beeldenstorm, a large and very disorderly wave of Calvinist mob destruction of Catholic images and church fittings that spread through the Low Countries in the summer of 1566 was the largest outbreak of this sort, with drastic political repercussions. This campaign of Calvinist iconoclasm \"provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs\" in Germany and \"antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox\" in the Baltic region. Similar patterns to the German actions, but with the addition of encouragement and sometimes finance from the national government, were seen in Anglican England in the English Civil War and English Commonwealth in the next century, when more damage was done to art in medieval parish churches than during the English Reformation.\n\nA major theological difference between Protestantism and Catholicism is the question of transubstantiation, or the literal transformation of the Communion wafer and wine into the body and blood of Christ, though both Lutheran and Reformed Christians affirmed the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, the former as a sacramental union and the latter as a pneumatic presence. Protestant churches that were not participating in the iconoclasm often selected as altarpieces scenes depicting the Last Supper. This helped the worshippers to recall their theology behind the Eucharist, as opposed to Catholic churches, which often chose crucifixion scenes for their altarpieces to remind the worshippers that the sacrifice of Christ and the sacrifice of the Mass were one and the same, via the literal transformation of the Eucharist.\n\nThe Protestant Reformation also capitalized on the popularity of printmaking in northern Europe. Printmaking allowed images to be mass-produced and widely available to the public at low cost. This allowed for the widespread availability of visually persuasive imagery. The Protestant church was therefore able, as the Catholic Church had been doing since the early 15th century, to bring their theology to the people, and religious education was brought from the church into the homes of the common people, thereby forming a direct link between the worshippers and the divine.\n\nThere was also a violent propaganda war fought partly with popular prints by both sides; these were often highly scurrilous caricatures of the other side and their doctrines. On the Protestant side, portraits of the leading reformers were popular, and their likenesses sometimes represented the Apostles and other figures in Biblical scenes such as the Last Supper.\n\nAfter the early years of the reformation, artists in Protestant areas painted far fewer religious subjects for public display, although there was a conscious effort to develop a Protestant iconography of Bible illustration in book illustrations and prints. In the early Reformation artists, especially Cranach the Elder and Younger and Holbein, made paintings for churches showing the leaders of the reformation in ways very similar to Catholic saints. Later Protestant taste turned from the display in churches of religious scenes, although some continued to be displayed in homes. There was also a reaction against large images from classical mythology, the other manifestation of high style at the time. This brought about a style that was more directly related to accurately portraying the present times. The traditions of landscapes and genre paintings that would fully flower in the 17th century began during this period.\n\nPeter Bruegel (1525‚Äì1569) of Flanders is the great genre painter of his time, who worked for both Catholic and Protestant patrons. In most of his paintings, even when depicting religious scenes, most space is given to landscape or peasant life in 16th century Flanders. Bruegel‚Äôs \"Wedding Feast\", portrays a Flemish-peasant wedding dinner in a barn, which makes no reference to any religious, historical or classical events, and merely gives insight into the everyday life of the Flemish peasant. Another great painter of his age, Lucas van Leyden (1489‚Äì1533), is known mostly for his engravings, such as \"The Milkmaid\", which depicts peasants with milk cows. This engraving, from 1510, well before the Reformation, contains no reference to religion or classicism, although much of his other work features both.\nBruegel was also an accomplished landscape painter. Frequently Bruegel painted agricultural landscapes, such as \"Summer\" from his famous set of the seasons, where he shows peasants harvesting wheat in the country, with a few workers taking a lunch break under a nearby tree. This type of landscape painting, apparently void of religious or classical connotations, gave birth to a long line of northern European landscape artists, such as Jacob van Ruisdael.\n\nWith the great development of the engraving and printmaking market in Antwerp in the 16th century, the public was provided with accessible and affordable images. Many artists provided drawings to book and print publishers, including Bruegel. In 1555 Bruegel began working for \"The Four Winds\", a publishing house owned by Hieronymus Cock. \"The Four Winds\" provided the public with almost a thousand etchings and engravings over two decades. Between 1555 and 1563 Bruegel supplied Cock with almost 40 drawings, which were engraved for the Flemish public.\n\nThe courtly style of Northern Mannerism in the second half of the century has been seen as partly motivated by the desire of rulers in both the Holy Roman Empire and France to find a style of art that could appeal to members of the courtly elite on both sides of the religious divide. Thus religious controversy had the rather ironic effect of encouraging classical mythology in art, since though they might disapprove, even the most stern Calvinists could not credibly claim that 16th century mythological art really represented idolatry.\n\nDuring the Reformation a great divergence arose between the Catholic Church and the Protestant Reformers of the north regarding the content and style of art work. The Catholic Church viewed Protestantism and Reformed iconoclasm as a threat to the church and in response came together at the Council of Trent to institute some of their own reforms. The church felt that much religious art in Catholic countries (especially Italy) had lost its focus on religious subject-matter, and became too interested in material things and decorative qualities. The council came together periodically between 1545 and 1563. The reforms that resulted from this council are what set the basis for what is known as the Counter-Reformation.\n\nItalian painting after the 1520s, with the notable exception of the art of Venice, developed into Mannerism, a highly sophisticated style, striving for effect, that concerned many churchman as lacking appeal for the mass of the population. Church pressure to restrain religious imagery affected art from the 1530s and resulted in the decrees of the final session of the Council of Trent in 1563 including short and rather inexplicit passages concerning religious images, which were to have great impact on the development of Catholic art. Previous Catholic Church councils had rarely felt the need to pronounce on these matters, unlike Orthodox ones which have often ruled on specific types of images.\n\nStatements are often made along the lines of \"The decrees of the Council of Trent stipulated that art was to be direct and compelling in its narrative presentation, that it was to provide an accurate presentation of the biblical narrative or saint‚Äôs life, rather than adding incidental and imaginary moments, and that it was to encourage piety\", but in fact the actual decrees of the council were far less explicit than this, though all of these points were probably in line with their intentions. The very short passage dealing with art came only in the final session in 1563, as a last minute and little-discussed addition, based on a French draft. The decree confirmed the traditional doctrine that images only represented the person depicted, and that veneration to them was paid to the person themself, not the image, and further instructed that: ...every superstition shall be removed ... all lasciviousness be avoided; in such wise that figures shall not be painted or adorned with a beauty exciting to lust... there be nothing seen that is disorderly, or that is unbecomingly or confusedly arranged, nothing that is profane, nothing indecorous, seeing that holiness becometh the house of God.\n\nAnd that these things may be the more faithfully observed, the holy Synod ordains, that no one be allowed to place, or cause to be placed, any unusual image, in any place, or church, howsoever exempted, except that image have been approved of by the bishop ...\n\nThe number of decorative treatments of religious subjects declined sharply, as did \"unbecomingly or confusedly arranged\" Mannerist pieces, as a number of books, notably by the Flemish theologian Molanus, Saint Charles Borromeo and Cardinal Gabriele Paleotti, and instructions by local bishops, amplified the decrees, often going into minute detail on what was acceptable. Many traditional iconographies considered without adequate scriptural foundation were in effect prohibited, as was any inclusion of classical pagan elements in religious art, and almost all nudity, including that of the infant Jesus. According to the great medievalist √âmile M√¢le, this was \"the death of medieval art\".\n\nWhile Calvinists largely removed public art from religion and Reformed societies moved towards more \"secular\" forms of art which might be said to glorify God through the portrayal of the \"natural beauty of His creation and by depicting people who were created in His image\", Counter-Reformation Catholic church continued to encourage religious art, but insisted it was strictly religious in content, glorifying God and Catholic traditions, including the sacraments and the saints. Likewise, \"Lutheran places of worship contain images and sculptures not only of Christ but also of biblical and occasionally of other saints as well as prominent decorated pulpits due to the importance of preaching, stained glass, ornate furniture, magnificent examples of traditional and modern architecture, carved or otherwise embellished altar pieces, and liberal use of candles on the altar and elsewhere.\" The main difference between Lutheran and Roman Catholic places of worship was the presence of the tabernacle in the latter.\n\nSydney Joseph Freedberg, who invented the term \"Counter-Maniera\", cautions against connecting this more austere style in religious painting, which spread from Rome from about 1550, too directly with the decrees of Trent, as it pre-dates these by several years. He describes the decrees as \"a codifying and official sanction of a temper that had come to be conspicuous in Roman culture\".\n\nScipione Pulzone's (1550‚Äì1598) painting of the Lamentation which was commissioned for the Church of the Ges√π in 1589 is a \"Counter-Maniera\" work that gives a clear demonstration of what the holy council was striving for in the new style of religious art. With the focus of the painting giving direct attention to the crucifixion of Christ, it complies with the religious content of the council and shows the story of the passion while keeping Christ in the image of the ideal human.\nTen years after the Council of Trent's decree Paolo Veronese was summoned by the Inquisition to explain why his \"Last Supper\", a huge canvas for the refectory of a monastery, contained, in the words of the Inquisition: \"buffoons, drunken Germans, dwarfs and other such scurrilities\" as well as extravagant costumes and settings, in what is indeed a fantasy version of a Venetian patrician feast. Veronese was told that he must change his indecorous painting within a three-month period - in fact he just changed the title to \"The Feast in the House of Levi\", still an episode from the Gospels, but a less doctrinally central one, and no more was said. No doubt any Protestant authorities would have been equally disapproving. The pre-existing decline in \"donor portraits\" (those who had paid for an altarpiece or other painting being placed within the painting) was also accelerated; these become rare after the Council.\nFurther waves of \"Counter-Reformation art\" occurred when areas formerly Protestant were again brought under Catholic rule. The churches were normally empty of images, and such periods could represent a boom time for artists. The best known example is the new Spanish Netherlands (essentially modern Belgium), which had been the centre of Protestantism in the Netherlands but became (initially) exclusively Catholic after the Spanish drove the Protestants to the north, where they established the United Provinces. Rubens was one of a number of Flemish Baroque painters who received many commissions, and produced several of his best known works re-filling the empty churches. Several cities in France in the French wars of religion and in Germany, Bohemia and elsewhere in the Thirty Years War saw similar bursts of restocking.\n\nThe rather extreme pronouncement by a synod in Antwerp in 1610 that in future the central panels of altarpieces should only show New Testament scenes was certainly ignored in the cases of many paintings by Rubens and other Flemish artists (and in particular the Jesuits continued to commission altarpieces centred on their saints, but nonetheless New Testament subjects probably did increase. Altarpieces became larger and more easy to make out from a distance, and the large painted or gilded carved wooden altarpieces that were the pride of many northern late medieval cities were often replaced with paintings.\n\nSome subjects were given increased prominence to reflect Counter-Reformation emphases. The \"Repentance of Peter\", showing the end of the episode of the \"Denial of Peter\", was not often seen before the Counter-Reformation, when it became popular as an assertion of the sacrament of Confession against Protestant attacks. This followed an influential book by the Jesuit Cardinal Robert Bellarmine (1542‚Äì1621). The image typically shows Peter in tears, as a half-length portrait with no other figures, often with hands clasped as at right, and sometimes \"the cock\" in the background; it was often coupled with a repentant Mary Magdalen, another exemplar from Bellarmine's book.\n\nAs the Counter-Reformation grew stronger and the Catholic Church felt less threat from the Protestant Reformation, Rome once again began to assert its universality to other nations around the world. The religious order of the Jesuits or the Society of Jesus, sent missionaries to the Americas, parts of Africa, India and eastern Asia and used the arts as an effective means of articulating their message of the Catholic Church's dominance over the Christian faith. The Jesuits' impact was so profound during their missions of the time that today very similar styles of art from the Counter-Reformation period in Catholic Churches are found all over the world.\n\nDespite the differences in approaches to religious art, stylistic developments passed about as quickly across religious divisions as within the two \"blocs\". Artistically Rome remained in closer touch with the Netherlands than with Spain.\n\n\n\n"}

Schumacher notes that after 1984 deregulation German public television passed its climax and became marginalized. Newly established commercial stations, operating without the burden of societal legitimacy, focused solely on profitability. To establish and maintain viewer loyalty these stations would broadcast reality shows, sensational journalism, daily soap operas, infotainment programs, talk shows, game shows and soft pornography. \"Product placement series that unabashedly display\" branded products \"are the overt expression of a kind of television refunctionalized as a supermarket\", laments Schumacher.\n\nIn his article Schumacher mentions \"Amusing Ourselves to Death\" by an American cultural critic Neil Postman, who formulated the thesis of television programming as a derivative of advertising, creating \"a species of information that might properly be called disinformation‚Äîmisplaced, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing\".\n\nLike Postman, Schumacher notes that contemporary television advertisement often chooses to reinforce brand loyalty rather than promoting product. This reverse marketing approach is used by television broadcasters to advertise the stations themselves. Schumacher lists three specific principles: grabbing the viewers' attention, establishing emotional involvement with the audience, and maintaining the viewers' interest as the cornerstones to acquiring and maintaining market share. A commercial RTL station described such a building of viewers' loyalty in positive terms: \"RTL has discovered something entirely new for television. The viewer\".\n\nSchumacher argues that viewer loyalty is established primarily through the representation of familiar emotional situations and the everyday problems of the viewers, which means that private stations broadcast predominantly private affairs. Further development of this approach led to creation of reality TV shows, which generate new realities by intervening directly in the actual life of its participants. Such personalisation and dramatization of television precipitated the \"Fall of Public Man\", in words of Richard Sennett.\n\nThe strategy of creating viewer loyalty through emotional sensations is reflected in scandalous \"special news\" that \"favor sex and crime topics and employ highly affective commentary style, a clip aesthetic as well as a musical accompaniment borrowed\nfrom the crime film genre\". As an example, Schumacher mentions \"Real Personal\" talk show about human sexuality that was televised by NBC five times a week during 1990s. \"The title itself encapsulates the message of 'B-TV': real people and their 'real' problems are the focus here\", contemplates Schumacher.\n\nMentioning the highly successful entertainment programs of David Letterman and Jay Leno, Schumacher proclaims that a talk show host, seen daily on the television screen, becomes almost a part of the family. \"Spreading not only inanity, but also a sense of security\", the host \"provides a fixed portion of our daily routine\" along with a daily soap opera, daily infotainment show or a daily game show.\n\n\"Appeals to viewer emotions and the active participation of the consumer enhance the ability of 'B-TV' to exploit the market\", concludes Schumacher.\n\nThe concept of personalization and dramatization was not lost on the creators of BuzzFeed a quarter century later, when they got interested in why some internet videos become viral. \"It turned out that the valuable things did not spread, and the things that did spread were used by people as a proxy of conversation, as an extension of themselves\", says Ze Frank, president of BuzzFeed Motion Pictures.\n\n\"We looked at the things people share, and we came up with three categories that were interesting to us: first, people expressing a part of their identitity. The second is emotional gifting. The third is social information 'Hey, we were talking about this the other day'. The information is already known, it is not new, all it does it helps resurfacing a known entity inside of a social connection. ... How do you use it? If identity can be expressed with content, what kinds of identities you can come up with? ... And then you make a crapload of content ... Our studio makes almost a 100 pieces of short form videos a week. ... [In broadcast television] you have to capture as large audience as possible and program for this audience, because the number of attention slots is finite. This means that 'niche' becomes a pejorative, and many people are left out of media conversation and have no chance to say: 'oh, my god, this is totally me'. The new era [of Internet video] allows us to multiply across these different experiences\". This approach worked and brought BuzzFeed millions of views and shares. \n\nGoing forward, BuzzFeed realized that a shareable video carrying branded message can reach a wide audience for a fraction of advertising budget used for traditional advertising campaign. \"We are applying the same general strategy: what are the values the brand is trying to communicate, and how they fit with the nearest social values that we know are fundamental to the consumer. ... We had a campaign for new lightweight kitty litter. The national campaign shown on broadcast television had people throwing litter into each other. It was beautifully shot, but it did not align with a single social value I can think of. Throwing litter into each other has a zero chance of being used to connect to another human being. So we took a step back and made a video which is more about relationship with cats, and we used the same kind of general idea of voice-over, and the video did really well\".\n\nWhile Schumacher and Postman regret the prevalence of \"advertisement television\" with low informational and social value on commercial TV stations, BuzzFeed intentionally produce personalized videos with capacity for sharing. Unlike traditional television, where viewers consume the content passively, users of internet video platforms share the videos they identify with, multiplying the effect of an advertising campaign.\n\nErik Henriksen from The Portland Mercury used the term \"B-TV\" when he reviewed \"Stargate Atlantis\" television series to describe the kind of show that is not \"genuinely great\", but one that \"just works‚Äîalbeit in a vaguely embarrassing and silly way‚Äîat entertaining the audience, at stringing along the same characters from week to week, at churning out boilerplate plots that are nonetheless peppered with just enough originality and uniqueness to make them enjoyable and fun and distracting.\"\n"}
{"id": "1425026", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1425026", "title": "Balenciaga", "text": "Balenciaga\n\nBalenciaga () is a luxury fashion house founded in Spain by Crist√≥bal Balenciaga, a designer born in the Basque Country, Spain. The brand is now owned by the French multinational company Kering. Balenciaga had a reputation as a \"couturier\" of uncompromising standards and was referred to as \"the master of us all\" by Christian Dior. His bubble skirts and odd, feminine, yet \"modernistic silhouettes\" became the trademarks of the house.\n\nCrist√≥bal Balenciaga opened his first boutique in San Sebasti√°n, Spain, in 1917, which expanded to include branches in Madrid and Barcelona. The Spanish royal family and the aristocracy wore his designs, but when the Spanish Civil War forced him to close his stores, Balenciaga moved to Paris.\n\nBalenciaga opened his Paris couture house on Avenue George V in August \n1937, and his first fashion show featured designs heavily influenced by the Spanish Renaissance. Balenciaga's success in Paris was nearly immediate. In the period of two years, the French press lauded him as a revolutionary, and his designs were highly sought-after. Carmel Snow, the editor of \"Harper's Bazaar\" was an early champion of his designs.\n\nCustomers risked their safety to travel to Europe during World War II to see Balenciaga's clothing. During this period, he was noted for his \"square coat,\" with sleeves cut in a single piece with the yoke, and for his designs with black (or black and brown) lace over bright pink fabric.\n\nHowever, it was not until the post-war years that the full scale of the inventiveness of this highly original designer became evident. His lines became more linear and sleek, diverging from the hourglass shape popularized by Christian Dior's \"New Look\". The fluidity of his silhouettes enabled him to manipulate the relationship between his clothing and women's bodies. In 1951, he totally transformed the silhouette, broadening the shoulders and removing the waist. In 1955, he designed the tunic dress, which later developed into the chemise dress of 1958. Other contributions in the postwar era included the spherical balloon jacket (1953), the high-waisted baby doll dress (1957), the cocoon coat (1957), the balloon skirt (1957), and the sack dress (1957). In 1959, his work culminated in the Empire line, with high-waisted dresses and coats cut like kimonos. His manipulation of the waist, in particular, contributed to \"what is considered to be his most important contribution to the world of fashion: a new silhouette for women.\"\n\nIn the 1960s, Balenciaga was an innovator in his use of fabrics: he tended toward heavy fabrics, intricate embroidery, and bold materials. His trademarks included \"collars that stood away from the collarbone to give a swanlike appearance\" and shortened \"bracelet\" sleeves. His often spare, sculptural creations‚Äîincluding funnel-shape gowns of stiff duchess satin worn to acclaim by clients such as Pauline de Rothschild, Bunny Mellon, Marella Agnelli, Hope Portocarrero, Gloria Guinness, and Mona von Bismarck‚Äîwere considered masterworks of haute couture in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1960, he designed the wedding dress for Queen Fabiola of Belgium made of ivory duchess satin trimmed with white mink at the collar and the hips. Jackie Kennedy famously upset John F. Kennedy for buying Balenciaga's expensive creations while he was President because he feared that the American public might think the purchases too lavish. Her haute couture bills were eventually discreetly paid by her father-in-law, Joseph Kennedy.\n\nSeveral designers who worked for Balenciaga would go on to open their own successful couture houses, notably Oscar de la Renta (1949), Andre Courreges (1950), Emanuel Ungaro (1958), but his most famous and noted prot√©g√© was Hubert de Givenchy, who was the lone designer to side with Balenciaga against the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture Parisienne and also the press over the scheduling of his shows.\n\nIn 1957, Balenciaga famously decided to show his collection to the fashion press the day before the clothing retail delivery date, not the standard four weeks before the retail delivery date the fashion industry followed at the time. By keeping the press unaware of the design of his garments until the day before they were shipped to stores, he hoped to curtail ongoing piracy and copying of his designs. The press resisted, finding it nearly impossible to get his work into their print deadlines, but Balenciaga and protege Givenchy stood firm, seriously impacting their coverage and press of the era. His supporters would argue that rival Christian Dior would gain acclaim from copying Balenciaga's silhouettes and cuts, claiming them as his own original work; because Balenciaga was not interested in press coverage, the media, and consumers never knew.\n\nIn 1967, both designers reversed their decision and joined the traditional schedule.\n\nBalenciaga defiantly resisted the rules, guidelines, and bourgeoisie status of the Chambre syndicale de la haute couture parisienne, and, thus, was never a member. Although he is spoken of with immense reverence, technically, Balenciaga couture was never haute couture.\n\nCrist√≥bal Balenciaga closed his fashion house in 1968 and died in 1972. The house lay dormant until 1986.\n\nIn 1986, Jacques Bogart S.A. acquired the rights to Balenciaga, and opened a new ready-to-wear line, \"Le Dix\". The first collection was designed by Michel Goma in October 1987, who remained at the house for the next five years to mixed reviews. He was replaced in 1992 with Dutch designer Josephus Thimister who began the restoration of Balenciaga to an elite, high-fashion status. During Thimister's term, Nicolas Ghesqui√®re would join as a license designer, and eventually was promoted to head designer in 1997.\n\nIn 1992, for the Summer Olympic Games, House of Balenciaga designed the French team's clothes.\n\nBalenciaga is now owned by Kering, formerly known as PPR, and its womenswear and menswear was headed by Nicolas Ghesqui√®re. Ghesqui√®re, like Balenciaga, is a self-taught designer, and apprenticed to Jean-Paul Gaultier and Agnes B. The hip, fresh interpretation of Balenciaga classics, such as the semifitted jacket and the sack dress, caught the attention of the media as well as such celebrities as Madonna and Sin√©ad O'Connor.\n\nIn 2002, Balenciaga's star Nicolas Ghesquiere imitated the work of Kaisik Wong, a designer from San Francisco. Ghesquiere created a patchwork vest in his spring collection that resembled one that Wong designed in 1973. Ghesquiere admitted in an interview in Paris that he had copied the garment.\n\nThere was some conflict within the House of Balenciaga on Ghesquiere's designs, with the Gucci group saying that if Balenciaga didn't make any money within the year 2007, they would replace him. Ghesqui√®re's F/W 2005 line showed that the house was not only making money, but also attracted a number of celebrity customers including editor-in-chief at \"Vogue\" Anna Wintour.\n\nThe House of Balenciaga designed the dresses worn by Jennifer Connelly and Nicole Kidman to the 2006 Academy Awards, as well as the wedding gown Kidman wore when she married Keith Urban. Kylie Minogue also wore a Balenciaga dress for her \"Slow\" and \"Red Blooded Woman\" music videos and for her concert tour.\n\nToday, the brand is most famous for its line of motorcycle-inspired handbags, especially the popular \"Lariat\". Balenciaga has eight exclusive boutiques in the United States. One Balenciaga store is located on 22nd St in New York City, New York. A second store is located in Los Angeles, California, on Melrose Avenue. Recently, a third store opened at the South Coast Plaza, in Costa Mesa, California. This store is and includes coffin-like inset displays. The New York and Los Angeles boutiques carry both men's and women's ready-to-wear, while the South Coast Plaza boutique carries only women's clothing. A fourth, located in Las Vegas inside Caesars Palace, carries only accessories. An additional location on the Las Vegas Strip, in Crystals at CityCenter, sells accessories as well as women's ready-to-wear. The boutique at Ala Moana Center in Honolulu, offers men's and women's ready-to-wear and accessories. There is a store at the Bal Harbour shops in Bal Harbour, Florida. An eighth store is opening spring 2014 in Dallas, Texas, at the Highland Park Village to become the first boutique in Texas. The Highland Park Village boutique is opening next to Christian Dior and will carry men's and women's ready to wear and accessories. All of the boutiques employ spirited architecture, with white paneling, marble, and glass work as well as black leather seats and light green, black and navy carpets or white tiles, emphasizing the brand's lean toward avant-garde and the drama of fashion.\n\nBalenciaga's Fall/Winter 2007 show impressed \"Teen Vogue\" editor-in-chief Amy Astley so much that an entire recent spread in the magazine, titled \"Global Studies\" and shot in Beijing, was influenced by it. The line included skinny jodhpurs, tight, fitted blazers, beaded embellished scarves, and other multicultural mixes.\n\nBalenciaga is known for creating avant-garde structural pieces, straddling the edge of fashion and forecasting the future of women's ready-to-wear fashion. Vintage Balenciaga garments are very popular among influential fashion editors, Hollywood stars, and top models, and have been seen on Sienna Miller, Lara Bingle, Raquel Zimmerman, Caroline Trentini, Emmanuelle Alt, Tatiana Sorokko, Hilary Rhoda, Jennifer Garner, and Stephanie Seymour, among others. Balenciaga is also frequently worn by fashion icon and actress Chlo√´ Sevigny, who is also a muse of Nicolas Ghesquiere.\nOn 24 March 2011 at San Francisco's M. H. de Young Museum, House of Balenciaga celebrated the opening of Balenciaga and Spain, a 120-piece fashion retrospective of Crist√≥bal Balenciaga's career. The exhibition included many Balenciaga designs from the Museums' encyclopedic costume collection, which boasts impressive holdings of creations by the designer. \"You can't even measure it,\" said Rodarte designer Laura Mulleavy of Crist√≥bal Balenciaga's influence. The $2,500-a-ticket fund-raiser for the museum drew 350 guests, including Denise Hale, Marissa Mayer, Vanessa Getty, Victoria Traina, Vanessa Traina, Jamie Tisch, Gwyneth Paltrow, Orlando Bloom, Balthazar Getty, Maggie Rizer, Connie Nielsen, Maria Bello, and Mia Wasikowska.\n\nOn November 5, 2012, Balenciaga announced that it was parting with creative director Nicolas Ghesqui√®re, ending his 15-year tenure. The brand announced Alexander Wang its new creative director. Wang presented his first collection for the label on February 28, 2013 at Paris Fashion Week. In 2014, the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris set a trial date for the lawsuit between Balenciaga vs. Ghesqui√®re. Kering-owned Balenciaga claimed that Ghesqui√®re's comments in the magazine \"System\" had hurt the company's image. The highly publicized suit was mediated out of court.\n\nOn July 30, 2015, Balenciaga announced it was parting with creative director Alexander Wang after three years. The Spring/Summer 2016 show was his last, featuring white loungewear made from soft, natural fabrics. In early October, the brand announced Demna Gvasalia as its new creative director.\n\n\nOn January 29, 2014, the character Myrtle Snow cries \"Balenciaga!\" as her dying words on the season finale of FX television show \"\".\n\nThe brand is mentioned in the single \"New Americana\" by Halsey. Nicki Minaj references the brand in her first single from the album \"Pink Print\", \"Bed of Lies\": \"Balenciaga's on my boot with the python strap\". It is also mentioned in A$AP Rocky's song \"Fashion Killa\" and Tee Grizzley's \"F*** It Off\" with Chris Brown. Ghanaian rapper EL makes reference to the brand in his hit single \"Koko\"‚Äî\"See me rocking my Balenciaga for my God oo.\" The brand is also referenced to by Bronx rapper A Boogie wit da Hoodie in his song \"Not a Regular Person\" with the lyrics \"I'm done with these Balenciagas...\" Cheat Codes has a song called Balenciaga. In the single OKRA by rapper Tyler, the Creator, Balenciaga is referenced in the lyric \"F*** it travel bag Balenciaga 30, 000 just for luggage\"\n\nThe brand is mentioned in the single ‚ÄúP Secondiglian‚Äù by New Trap Neapolitan Singer Ge√¥lier.\n\n\"RuPaul's Drag Race\" contestant Elijah Kelly uses the brand as the last name of his drag persona, Mariah Paris Balenciaga.\n\nIn 2018, singer Ozuna released a single featuring Ele a el Dominio called \"Balenciaga\".\n\nIn Cardi B's hit single I Like It, the rapper references the brand in the line, \"I like those Balenciagas, the ones that look like socks.\" On the same song, featured artist J Balvin mentions the brand in Spanish: \"Mis tenis Balenciaga, me reciben en la entrada.\"\n\n6LACK and Offset also released a song called \"Balenciaga Challenge\" in his album \"East Atlanta Love Letter.\" \nOn April 25, 2018, a Chinese customer was allegedly assaulted by a group of other customers who refused to enter the Printemps Balenciaga store in Paris in an orderly fashion. The Chinese customer, who is an elderly lady, protested to the group of queue-jumping customers, who responded by allegedly shoving the Chinese customer. A skirmish broke out in front of the fashion house between the Chinese customer's son and the group of queue-jumping customers. Employees for the fashion house and department store security reacted quickly to contain the incident. Security guards apparently wearing Balenciaga uniform can be seen restraining the son of the Chinese customer. Employees for the fashion house were also heard insulting the Chinese customer and her son, who were ultimately removed from the premise.\n\nA viral video of the incident quickly swept through Chinese social media website Weibo, which enraged Chinese customers, and are calling for a boycott of the fashion house.\n\nOn April 27, 2018, two days after the incident, the House of Balenciaga issued a public notice and apology concerning the April 25, 2018, incident. The fashion house apparently suspended the management staff present during the incident and is working closely with Printemps store management to investigate the matter.\n\nUsers on social media are questioning the sincerity of the fashion house's public apology. \n\nThe hashtag #Boycott BalenciagaDiscriminatesChinese have been viewed 23 million times on Weibo as of Friday, April 27, 2018.\n\n"}

It is based on the DC Comics character of the same name, created by Tony Isabella and Trevor Von Eeden. It stars Cress Williams as the titular character alongside China Anne McClain, Nafessa Williams, Christine Adams, Marvin Jones III, Damon Gupton, and James Remar. The series sees the retired Black Lightning return to the hero life and its effects on his family life.\n\nDevelopment on the series began in September 2016 when Fox ordered a pilot production commitment for \"Black Lightning\". In February 2017, Fox passed on the series, with it being picked up by The CW with a new script for the pilot. The CW officially ordered the series in May 2017. The first season premiered on January 16, 2018, for a 13-episode run. On April 2, 2018, The CW renewed the show for a second season, which premiered on October 9, 2018.\n\nHigh school principal Jefferson Pierce, who retired from his superhero persona Black Lightning nine years ago after seeing the effects it had on his family, is forced to become a vigilante again when the rise of the local gang called the 100 leads to increased crime and corruption in his community of Freeland.\n\nIn season two, as Black Lightning continues his feud with the 100's leader Tobias Whale, he and his family deal with the arising anti-superhuman bigotry within their community after its metahuman members' existences are exposed.\n\n\nIn September 2016, after being in various stages of development, Warner Bros. Television began pitching \"Black Lightning\" to networks. The project was being developed by Mara Brock Akil and her husband, Salim Akil. They were partnered with Greg Berlanti, who was behind several DC Comics properties for the studio, eventually landing at Fox with a pilot production commitment. In February 2017, Fox opted not to go forward with the project, deciding that it was \"not a good fit into its already crowded genre drama space\". Warner Bros. Television presented the project to other networks, with The CW officially ordering a pilot for \"Black Lightning\". The CW also opted to discard the original pilot script, as it had been written for Fox, and shoot a short presentation instead. The CW officially ordered \"Black Lightning\" to series on May 10, 2017.\n\nOn April 2, 2018, The CW renewed the show for a second season, which premiered on October 9, 2018.\n\nSalim Akil stated that \"Black Lightning\" would not follow the villain of the week format or be a procedural, because he wanted to \"explore the characters, even the villains\".\n\nIn late February 2017, Cress Williams was cast as Jefferson Pierce / Black Lightning, followed a month later by the casting of China Anne McClain and Nafessa Williams as his daughters, Jennifer Pierce and Anissa Pierce, respectively, and Christine Adams was cast as Lynn Pierce, Jefferson's ex-wife. At the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con International, it was announced that James Remar and Damon Gupton had joined the cast as Pierce's friend Peter Gambi and detective inspector Henderson, respectively.

Netflix airs new episodes of Black Lightning weekly outside of the United States. \n\nThe first season was released on Blu-ray and DVD in Region 1 on June 26, 2018.\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season has received a 96% approval rating, with an average rating of 8.35/10, based on 48 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Black Lightning\" doesn't reinvent superhero TV, but it does give the genre a necessary jolt with real-world plots, scary new villains, and a star-making performance from Cress Williams.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 79 out of 100 based on 25 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nDaniel Fienberg, in a review for \"The Hollywood Reporter\", praised the series for being \"smart and relevant and full of an attitude that's all its own.\" Nafessa Williams's portrayal of Thunder has received praise for being the first representation of a black lesbian superhero on television.\n\nDespite airing on The CW and being created by Berlanti, Mark Pedowitz, president of The CW said in May 2017 that the series \"at this time, is not part of the Arrowverse. It is a separate situation.\" Berlanti had previously stated when the series was in development at Fox that it would not crossover with his other DC Comics television properties on The CW nor would it exist in the Arrowverse. However, Akil later stated that they were not ruling out eventual crossovers. In August 2017, Pedowitz added, \"If [the showrunners] wish to bring it in, that is their call. We had a long discussion with the studio, Mara, Salim, and myself. We were fine with them making it separate from the Arrowverse, they have a different point of view. If they end up wanting to go that way, that will be their decision.\" Salim Akil noted references in the first season to the Arrowverse heroes Vixen and Supergirl were a \"fun\" way \"to tease the fans\". He also further reiterated that the series existed on a separate Earth from the other Arrowverse series (like Earth-1 from \"The Flash\", \"Arrow\", and \"Legends of Tomorrow\" and Earth-38 from \"Supergirl\") and was hopeful that any future crossover would involve the heroes of the other series visiting the Earth that is associated with \"Black Lightning\".\n\n"}
{"id": "816196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=816196", "title": "Bradshaw rock paintings", "text": "Bradshaw rock paintings\n\nBradshaw rock paintings, Bradshaw rock art, Bradshaw figures or The Bradshaws, are terms used to describe one of the two major regional traditions of rock art found in the north-west Kimberley region of Western Australia. The identity of who painted these figures and the age of the art are contended within archaeology and amongst Australian rock art researchers. These aspects have been debated since the works were first discovered and recorded by pastoralist Joseph Bradshaw in 1891, after whom they were named. As the Kimberley is home to various Aboriginal language groups, the rock art is referred to and known by many different Aboriginal names, the most common of which are \"Gwion Gwion\" or \"Giro Giro.\" The art consists primarily of human figures ornamented with accessories such as bags, tassels and headdresses.\n\nRock art in the Kimberley region was first recorded by the explorer and future South Australian governor, Sir George Grey as early as 1838. This rock art is now known as Wandjina style art.\n\nWhile searching for suitable pastoral land in the then remote Roe River area in 1891, pastoralist Joseph Bradshaw discovered an unusual type of rock art on a sandstone escarpment. Bradshaw recognised that this style of painting was unique when compared to the Wandjina style. In a subsequent address to the Victorian branch of the Royal Geographical Society, he commented on the fine detail, the colours, such as brown, yellow and pale blue, and he compared it aesthetically to that of Ancient Egypt.\n\nAmerican archaeologist Daniel Sutherland Davidson briefly commented on Bradshaw's figures while undertaking a survey of Australian rock art that he would publish in 1936. Davidson noted that Bradshaw's encounter with this art was brief and lacked any Aboriginal interpretations; furthermore, as Bradshaw's sketches of the art were at this time the only visual evidence, Davidson argued that they could be inaccurate and possibly drawn from a Eurocentric bias. The rediscovery of the original mural after more than a century has shown that Bradshaw had a remarkable gift for reproduction without photography, and that Davidson's criticisms were unfounded in the absence of the original. Bradshaw's figures and their existence as an artistic tradition was questioned; articles and books on these works were not published until the 1950s.\nWith the growth of anthropological interest in Peninsula region, research in the coastal area brought with it an awareness of Aboriginal art and culture. However, attention to the Bradshaw art was sporadic. Several researchers who encountered the Bradshaw-type of paintings during expeditions to the region were members of the 1938 Frobenius Institute expedition. Agnes Schultz noted that unlike with Wandjina art, Aboriginal people showed little interest in the Bradshaw paintings, although they recognised them as depictions of bush spirits or \"D‚Äôimi.\"\n\nWhen pressed, the expedition's Aboriginal guide explained their creation:\nAnthropologist Robert Layton notes that researchers such as Ian Crawford, who worked in the region in 1969, and Patricia Vinnicombe, who work in the region in the 1980s, were both told similar creation stories regarding the Bradshaw-type art.\nSince 1980, more systematic work has been done in an effort to identify more Bradshaw rock art sites in the Kimberley.\n\nThe most notable has been the work undertaken by amateur archaeologist Grahame Walsh, who began work there in 1977 and returned to record and locate new sites up until his death in 2007. The results of this work produced a database of 1.5 million rock art images and recordings of 1,500 new rock art sites. He expanded his records by studying superimposition and style sequences of the paintings to establish a chronology that demonstrated that \"Bradshaw art\" is found early in the Kimberley rock art sequence. He proposed that the art dated to a period prior to the Pleistocene.\nMany of the ancient rock paintings maintain vivid colours because they have been colonised by bacteria and fungi, such as the black fungus, \"Chaetothyriales.\" The pigments originally applied may have initiated an ongoing, symbiotic relationship between black fungi and red bacteria.\n\nBased on stylistic characteristics, Walsh categorised two individual styles of ‚ÄòBradshaw paintings‚Äô, which he named ‚ÄòTassel‚Äô and ‚ÄòSash‚Äô for dominant clothing features. He also identified two variants, which he named ‚ÄòElegant Action figures‚Äô and ‚ÄòClothes Peg figures‚Äô.\n\nThe distribution and stylistic range of these paintings is quite distinctive, and contrasts with the Wandjina tradition. While more common in some areas, such as the sandstone regions of the west and central Kimberley, isolated examples have also been found in several scattered locations in the east, such as the Napier Ranges, and at the far eastern border of the Kimberley. The art is primarily painted where a suitable rock shelter is found; in contrast with Wandjina art, which has a limited distribution restricted to isolated sites. Unlike Wandjina, Bradshaw art is rarely found on ceilings, rather vertical rock surfaces are used, high up in escarpments in shallower rock shelters with small overhangs and with irregular rocky floors not suitable for occupation.\nThe Bradshaw paintings predominantly depict human silhouette figures that appear to be suspended in the air or in a dynamic style that suggests running, hunting or dancing. While gender is rarely portrayed in the paintings, limb, arm and shoulder muscles are often well defined in addition to stomach paunches. The question of gender representation in Bradshaw art was illuminated recently by the discovery that figures are depicted as if they are facing into the rock face. This perspective has been overlooked until now because of the Western bias toward images that ‚Äúface out‚Äù, but also because the ‚Äúfacing in‚Äù perspective is more evident in depictions with excellent delineation of body contours, such as the rare, Classic Realistic style, which is also earliest in superposition studies;). If one appreciates the ‚Äúfacing in‚Äù perspective, it becomes evident that the many attributions of ‚Äúpaunches‚Äô by are incorrect, both because they can now be seen to be located at the rear of these figures, but also because it is anatomically incorrect to attribute the belly to gluteal structures located more inferiorly. Furthermore, the figures are ornamented with a diversity of objects such as belts, headdresses, bags and tassels, while other material culture is sometimes depicted, such as boomerangs and wands. While Bradshaw initially described the colour of the art as having shades of pale blue and yellow, most figures have a deep purple-red hue, mulberry colour or a red to yellow-brown colour. However, Donaldson notes that there are rare examples of multi-coloured figures that retain some yellow and white pigment. The height of the art is variable; most are between 40 and 50¬†cm in length with some examples up to 2 metres in height.\n\nArtistically, Bradshaws are unusually advanced both in technique and style. Image processing has revealed that the outline of the Bradshaw figures are often painted first, then filled in. Engraving in the rock often follows the outlines of figures and may have served as a preliminary sketch which implies planning. Some faces of the figures are painted with anatomically correct features with enough detail to be considered portraits. Due to the fine detail and control found in the images, such as strands of hair painted in 1-2mm thicknesses, it has been suggested that feather quills may have been used as a technique to apply the paint to the rock walls; an imprint of a feather found at one site may support this possibility. No evidence has yet been found of any corrections or changes in composition during or after painting, while evidence of restoration have been found. In a detailed study of 66 Bradshaw panels, approximately 9% of the Bradshaw images have clearly been vandalized. Some were scratched with stones, some damaged by thrown stones, and some have been broken by hammering with large rocks.\n\nWith the exception of Elegant Action Figures which have been left undamaged for unknown reasons, all Bradshaw paintings exhibit possible vandalism, which may indicate ritual mutilation or defacing. Superpositioning of images, another form of vandalism, is common throughout the Kimberley.\n\nThe Bradshaws are not the regions' earliest paintings. The earlier art consists of crude animal drawings that are believed to be up to 40,000 years old. The Bradshaws have nothing in common with this earlier art and first appeared following the peak of the most recent Pleistocene glacial maximum, which is dated between 26,500 and 20,000 years ago.\n\nSince the mid-1990s, scientific dating methods have been used to determine the ages of the Bradshaw paintings. The methods have included, Accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dating (AMS) and Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL). This was used when mud wasp nests have been built over paintings, and it gives a minimum age rather than an actual age of the painting. The results of this have revealed some inconsistency with Walsh's chronology. Experimental OSL dates from a wasp nest overlaying a tassel Bradshaw figure has given a Pleistocene date of 17,500¬±1,800 years BP. The academic community generally accepts 5,000 BP for the end of the artistic style. If the date ranges are correct, this may demonstrate that the Bradshaw tradition was produced for many millennia. Geoarchaeologist, Alan Watchman posits that the red paint used on a tasselled Bradshaw image near the Drysdale River is \"likely to be only about 3,000 years old.\" Using the AMS results from accreted paint layers containing carbon associated with another figure, gives a date of 3,880 BP making Bradshaw art contemporaneous with, and no older than, Wanjina art. Around 15,000 years ago, the archaeological record shows that Aboriginals in the Kimberleys began using stone points in place of multi-barbed spears, but there is no record of this change of technology in the Bradshaw paintings. The most recent paintings still depict the use of multi-barbed spears.\n\nIn 2008, rock art depicting what is thought to be a Thylacoleo was discovered on the north-western coast of the Kimberley. This represented only the second example of megafauna depicted by the Indigenous inhabitants of Australia. The image has a \"clothes peg\" Bradshaw superimposed over the thorax, while a \"Tassel\" Bradshaw crosses the forearm of the animal. In 2009, a second image was found that depicts a thylacoleo interacting with an \"elegant action\" Bradshaw who is in the act of spearing or fending the animal off with a multibarbed spear. Much smaller and less detailed than the 2008 find, it may depict a thylacine however, the comparative size and morphology indicates a thylacoleo is more likely, a position supported by palaeontologists and archaeologists who have examined the image. As the Thylacoleo is believed to have become extinct 45,000‚Äì46,000 years ago, this suggests a similar age for the associated Bradshaw art. Archaeologist Kim Akerman however believes that the megafauna may have persisted later in wetter areas of the continent as suggested by Wells, and has suggested an age of 15,000 to 22,000 years for the paintings.\n\nRecent advances in dating methods may shed light on the age of the paintings and gain a more accurate result. Neuroscientist Jack Pettigrew has proposed dating the art by using DNA sequencing extracted from colonies of microorganisms which have replaced the pigment in some paintings.\n\nThe fossil record of climate and vegetation at the Last Glacial Maximum is sparse, but still clear enough to provide an overview. When the Kimberley region was first occupied circa 40,000 years ago, the region consisted of open tropical forests and woodlands. After around 10,000 years of stable climatic conditions, temperatures began cooling and winds became stronger, leading to the beginning of an ice-age. During the glacial maximum, 25,000 to 15,000 years ago, the sea level was some 140 metres below its present level, with the coastline extending 400 kilometres further to the north-west. Australia was connected to New Guinea, and the Kimberley was separated from Southeast Asia (\"Wallacea\") by a strait approximately 90¬†km wide. Rainfall decreased by 40% to 50% depending on region, while the lower CO2 levels (half pre-industrial levels) meant that vegetation required twice as much water to photosynthesize. The Kimberley region, including the adjacent exposed continental Sahul Shelf, was covered by vast grasslands, while woodlands and semi-arid scrub covered the shelf joining New Guinea to Australia. Southeast of the Kimberley, from the Gulf of Carpentaria to northern Tasmania the land, including the western and southern margins of the now exposed continental shelves, was covered by extreme deserts and sand dunes. It is believed that no more than 15% of Australia supported trees of any kind. While some tree cover remained in the south/east of Australia, the vegetation of the wetter coastal areas in this region was semi-arid savannah. Tasmania was covered primarily by cold steppe and alpine grasslands, with snow pines at lower altitudes. There is evidence that there may have been a significant reduction in Australian Aboriginal populations during this time. It appears there were scattered \"refugia\" in which the modern vegetation types and human populations were able to survive. With the end of the ice-age, the Kimberley region settled into a tropical monsoon climate until a major El Ni√±o‚ÄìSouthern Oscillation event in the mid Holocene caused the Australian summer monsoon rains to weaken or fail for some 1,500 years.\n\nThe discontinuity in artistic styles between the earlier Bradshaws and the current Wandjina has been attributed to the severe drought phase that followed the collapse of the wet season in 5,500 BP. The Bradshaw style art ended around this time, possibly within 500 years. The emergence of Wandjina art depicting cloud and rain spirits 3,800 to 4,000 years ago coincides with the end of the \"mega-drought\" and a return of the rain which gave the region its current climate. The research paper's lead author, Hamish McGowan, suggests further investigation into the resulting cultural collapse and the possibility that another ethnic group supplanted the Bradshaw artists. The chair in Kimberley rock art at the University of Western Australia, Peter Veth, has critiqued the research paper for claiming that simultaneous changes in climate patterns and art styles indicates the collapse of a culture. Veth suggests that a climate change coinciding with the change from Bradshaw to Wandjina art is coincidence, pointing out that the archaeology of the Kimberley does not show a break in occupation, and that stylistic changes in Aboriginal art have occurred elsewhere in Australia. Additionally, the migration of a new ethnic group into the area is unsupported by the linguistics.\n\nResearch undertaken in relation to Aboriginal knowledge has also increased. This has primarily been seen in Aboriginal names being applied to the Bradshaw paintings, reflecting the specific Aboriginal languages used in the areas where they are found. For example, the Ngarinyin name for the art is \"Gwion Gwion\". Other terms include \"giro giro\" used by Aboriginal people in the Napier, Broome Bay and Prince Regent River. Australian rock art researcher David Welch notes that these words are probably different regional accents of \"Kujon,\" the name of the bird found in the creation story originally heard by Schultz in 1938. Aboriginal people are also more open in telling foreigners stories regarding the images. These stories often relate to spirits who created dances which are still performed today and feature similar apparel found in the paintings, such as headdresses, boomerangs and string. \"Bradshaws (Gwion Gwion)\" are also depicted in contemporary art works produced for sale in the Kimberley; one notable \"Gwion Gwion\" artist is Kevin Waina.\n\nResearch concerning Bradshaw art is controversial and little consensus has been reached. Debate has primarily concerned Walsh's interpretations regarding the origins, dating and ethnicity of the Bradshaw artists, and his rejection of Aboriginal people as being their descendants. The implications of his interpretations generated considerable criticism beginning in the mid 1990s due to its continuing potential to undermine native title claims in the Kimberley. The ongoing disagreements regarding the age of the art and debate about whether it was created by non-Indigenous people makes Bradshaw rock art one of Australian archaeology's most contentious topics.\n\nAccording to Walsh, Bradshaw art was associated with a period he called the \"Erudite Epoch\", a time before Aboriginal people populated Australia. He suggested that the art may be the product of an ethnic group who had likely arrived in Australia from Indonesia, only to be displaced by the ancestors of present-day Aboriginal people. Walsh based this interpretation on the sophistication of Bradshaw art when compared to other art in the Kimberley region, such as the much later Wandjina styles.\nMedia coverage has at times emphasised his claims of mysterious races. Pettigrew suggests that the Bradshaw paintings depict people with ‚Äòpeppercorn curls‚Äô and small stature that characterise San groups; he speculates that African people travelled, shortly after the Toba eruption some 70,000 years ago, by reed boat across the Indian Ocean, provisioning themselves with the fruit of the baobab tree. The Australian archaeological community has generally not accepted such claims and believes that Bradshaw are indigenous works. For example, Dr Andree Rosenfeld argued that the aesthetics of the art did not support claims for a non-Aboriginal origin when comparison is made to the aesthetic value of contemporary Aboriginal art. The Australian Archaeological Association in a press release stated, \"No archaeological evidence exists which suggests that the early colonisation of Australia was by anyone other than the ancestors of contemporary Aboriginal people\", the release quoted Claire Smith: \"such interpretations are based on and encourage racist stereotypes\".\n\nAboriginal people also criticised Grahame Walsh, arguing that he failed to hear their explanations of the significance that the paintings had in their culture. Crawford records being told by an Aboriginal elder in 1969 that the Bradshaws were \"rubbish paintings\", a quote that Walsh would repeat continually in support of his own theory that the art was not of Aboriginal origin. In the local Indigenous English, \"rubbish\" is an adjective usually used to describe someone who is too old or too young to be active in the local culture. Another use is meaning something is \"not dangerous,\" for example, non-poisonous snakes are all considered to be \"rubbish\" while in contrast, poisonous snakes are all \"cheeky.\"\n\nScholars have generally rejected the idea that Bradshaw art was painted by anyone other than Aboriginal people. Statistical analysis undertaken by Michael Barry has concluded that the Bradshaw art shares no stylistic attributes with prehistoric figurative art overseas. Moreover, Barry argues that stylistically, Bradshaw art has more in common with art found elsewhere in Australia, such as figures painted in Arnhem Land. Some popular historians and amateur researchers have continued to suggest exotic origins for the Bradshaw rock paintings, although these interpretations are considered fringe by reviewers.\n\nIn many cases, Tassel and Sash figures appear to be involved in either dancing, ecstatic behaviour, or both which, according to a study by Michaelson \"et al.,\" may represent shamanistic rituals or creation ceremonies. Eucalyptus leaves (which can be used as a psychoactive drug) are commonly depicted with Tassel and Sash figures that appear to be in motion.\n\nMichaelson \"et al.\" cited studies by A. P. Elkin in which he argued that Aboriginal and Tibetan shamanism have markedly close similarities. He also noted that the worldwide pattern of shamanism suggests a common heritage that radiated outward from North Africa about 50,000 years ago; it may have originated as a woman's role which over time has been taken over by men. Aboriginal females in Australia have explicitly been recorded as saying that men had taken over roles they once performed in ceremonies. This is supported by many completely different languages having a similar word for female shamans (e.g., udaghan, udagan, utygan), while the term for male shamans is distinct in each language. Michaelson considered it significant that while few females are depicted in Bradshaw art, Tassel figures which appear to be leading ceremonies (the oldest art) clearly have breasts, in contrast to later art which depicts males in the leading roles. Pettigrew identifies elements of Bradshaw art with symbols used by Sandawe artists to convey their experience with hallucinogens, and others that seem to show hallucinatory elements. From this he infers that psilocybin-induced trances were a feature of both cultures.\n\nHowever, only a small number of researchers believe that shamanism has been part of the culture of Indigenous Australians. George Chaloupka, an expert on Indigenous Australian rock art, puts it bluntly, \"Shamaniacs rule the world at present...It's just another orthodoxy basking in its five minutes of sunshine.\" Grahame Walsh considered the idea of female shamans in the Bradshaw culture \"preposterous\". Pointing out that female Bradshaw images tend to have extremely prominent breasts, Walsh says that the smaller breasts identified by Michaelson are probably chest-band decorations.\n\nAerial fire-bombing and back burning by the Western Australian Department of Parks and Wildlife and the Department of Fire and Emergency Services since 2009 as part of the government's fire prevention strategy to aid the exploitation of oil and gas reserves has caused paint to peel from over 5,000 of the 8,742 known examples of Bradshaw art. A survey by archaeologist Lee Scott-Virtue has determined that up to 30 per cent of the rock art had been completely destroyed by fire.\n\n\n"}

The twelfth forms the mid-point of the novel. Each interrupted narrative then concludes. Reminiscent of David Mitchell's \"Cloud Atlas\", they form a mosaic, connected through a pattern of musical motifs, transposed scenes, and recurring characters. \"Calendar of Regrets\" is a narrative about narrativity itself, the human obsession with telling ourselves and our worlds over and over again in an attempt to stabilize a truth that, as Vladimir Nabokov once said, should only exist within quotation marks.\n\n\"Review of Contemporary Fiction\" wrote \"these stories explore the perplexity about ways of knowing and how knowledge is made manifest through storytelling,\" while \"Rain Taxi\" said Olsen's novel \"ultimately reminds us of the ways that art and narrative doggedly navigate that thin line between the drive for order and the deep-seated realization that the universe that greets us each morning has only increased its entropy.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "19163673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19163673", "title": "Cartographic generalization", "text": "Cartographic generalization\n\nCartographic generalization, or map generalization, is a method for deriving a smaller-scale map from a larger scale map or map data. Whether done manually by a cartographer or by a computer or set of algorithms, generalization seeks to abstract spatial information at a high level of detail to information that can be rendered on a map at a lower level of detail. For example, we might have the outlines of all of the thousands of buildings in a region, but we wish to make a map of the whole city no more than a few inches wide. Instead of throwing out the building information, or trying to render it all at once, we could generalize the data into some sort of outline of the urbanized area of the region.\n\nThe cartographer has license to adjust the content within their maps to create a suitable and useful map that conveys spatial information, while striking the right balance between the map's purpose and the precise detail of the subject being mapped. Well generalized maps are those that emphasize the most important map elements while still representing the world in the most faithful and recognizable way.\n\nThere are many cartographic techniques that may fall into the broad category of generalization. Here are brief descriptions of some of the more common methods:\n\nMap generalization is designed to reduce the complexities of the real world by strategically reducing ancillary and unnecessary details. One way that geospatial data can be reduced is through the selection process. The cartographer can select and retain certain elements that he/she deems the most necessary or appropriate. In this method, the most important elements stand out while lesser elements are left out entirely. For example, a directional map between two points may have lesser and un-traveled roadways omitted as not to confuse the map-reader. The selection of the most direct and uncomplicated route between the two points is the most important data, and the cartographer may choose to emphasize this.\n\nGeneralization is not a process that only removes and selects data, but also a process that simplifies or abstracts it as well. Simplification is a technique where the general shapes of features are retained, while eliminating unnecessary detail. Generally, smaller scale maps have more simplified features than larger scale maps. The Ramer‚ÄìDouglas‚ÄìPeucker algorithm is one of the earliest and still most common techniques for line simplification.\n\nSimplification can be achieved in different ways: by eliminating parts of and giving an area a more familiar shape, by removing unimportant points off a shape - usually performed by a software, by eliminating small features such as islands, or by smoothing \"rough\" features such as straightening curvy lines to highlight their trend.\n\nSimplification also takes on other roles when considering the role of combination. Overall data reduction techniques can also mean that in addition to generalizing elements of particular features, features can also be combined when their separation is irrelevant to the map focus. A mountain chain may be isolated into several smaller ridges and peaks with intermittent forest in the natural environment, but shown as a continuous chain on the map, as determined by scale. The map reader has to, again remember, that because of scale limitations combined elements are not concise depictions of natural or manmade features.\n\nSmoothing is also a process that the map maker can employ to reduce the angularity of line work. Smoothing is yet another way of simplifying the map features, but involves several other characteristics of generalization that lead into feature displacement and locational shifting. The purpose of smoothing is to exhibit linework in a much less complicated and a less visually jarring way. An example of smoothing would be for a jagged roadway, cut through a mountain, to be smoothed out so that the angular turns and transitions appear much more fluid and natural.\n\nEnhancement is also a method that can be employed by the cartographer to illuminate specific elements that aid in map reading. As many of the aforementioned generalizing methods focus on the reduction and omission of detail, the enhancement method concentrates on the addition of detail. Enhancement can be used to show the true character of the feature being represented and is often used by the cartographer to highlight specific details about his or her specific knowledge, that would otherwise be left out. An example includes enhancing the detail about specific river rapids so that the map reader may know the facets of traversing the most difficult sections beforehand. Enhancement can be a valuable tool in aiding the map reader to elements that carry significant weight to the map‚Äôs intent.\n\nDisplacement can be employed when 2 objects are so close to each other that they would overlap at smaller scales. A common place where this would occur is the cities Brazzaville and Kinshasa on either side of the Congo river in Africa. They are both the capital city of their country and on overview maps they would be displayed with a slightly larger symbol than other cities. Depending on the scale of the map the symbols would overlap. By displacing both of them away from the river (and away from their true location) the symbol overlap can be avoided. Another common case is when a road and a railroad run parallel to each other. this is mostly adopted using the azimuthal projection method.\n\nExaggeration is the selection of map symbols that make features appear larger than they really are to make them more visible, recognizable, or higher in the visual hierarchy. For example, in a small-scale map, highways, rivers, and railroads may be drawn as thick lines that would be miles wide if measured according to the scale. Exaggeration often necessitates a subsequent displacement operation because wide lines representing features located near each other will overlap.\n\nAggregation is the merger of multiple features into a new composite feature. The new feature is of a type different than the original individuals, because it conceptualizes the group. For example, a multitude of buildings can be turned into a single region representing an \"urban area.\"\n\nAs GIS developed from about the late 1960s onward, the need for automatic, algorithmic generalization techniques became clear. Ideally, agencies responsible for collecting and maintaining spatial data should try to keep only one canonical representation of a given feature, at the highest possible level of detail. That way there is only one record to update when that feature changes in the real world. From this large-scale data, it should ideally be possible, through automated generalization, to produce maps and other data products at any scale required. The alternative is to maintain separate databases each at the scale required for a given set of mapping projects, each of which requires attention when something changes in the real world.\n\nSeveral broad approaches to generalization were developed around this time:\n\n\nThere are far more small geographic features than large ones in the Earth's surface, or far more small things than large ones in maps. This notion of far more small things than large ones is also called spatial heterogeneity, which has been formulated as scaling law. Cartographic generalization or any mapping practices in general is essentially to retain the underlying scaling of numerous smallest, a very few largest, and some in between the smallest and largest. This mapping process can be efficiently and effectively achieved by head/tail breaks, a new classification scheme or visualization tool for data with a heavy tailed distribution. Scaling law is likely to replace T√∂pfer's radical law to be a universal law for various mapping practices. What underlies scaling law is something of paradigm shift from Euclidean geometry to fractal, from non-recursive thinking to recursive thinking.\n\nThe Baltimore Phenomenon is the tendency for a city (or other object) to be omitted from maps due to space constraints while smaller cities are included on the same map simply because space is available to display them. This phenomenon owes its name to the city of Baltimore, Maryland, which tends to be omitted on maps due to the presence of larger cities in close proximity within the Mid-Atlantic United States. As larger cities near Baltimore appear on maps, smaller and lesser known cities may also appear at the same scale simply because there is enough space for them on the map.\n\nAlthough the Baltimore Phenomenon occurs more frequently on automated mapping sites, it does not occur at every scale. Popular mapping sites like Google Maps, Bing Maps, OpenStreetMap, and Yahoo Maps will only begin displaying Baltimore at certain zoom levels: 5th, 6th, 7th, etc.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20177296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20177296", "title": "Characterization", "text": "Characterization\n\nCharacterization or characterisation is the representation of persons (or other beings or creatures) in narrative and dramatic works of art. This representation may include direct methods like the attribution of qualities in description or commentary, and indirect (or \"dramatic\") methods inviting readers to infer qualities from characters' actions, dialogue, or appearance. Such a personage is called a character. Character is a literary element.\n\nThe term \"characterization\" was introduced in the 19th century. Aristotle promoted the primacy of plot over characters, that is, a plot-driven narrative, arguing in his \"Poetics\" that tragedy \"is a representation, not of men, but of action and life.\" This view was reversed in the 19th century, when the primacy of the character, that is, a character-driven narrative, was affirmed first with the realist novel, and increasingly later with the influential development of psychology.\n\nThere are two ways an author can convey information about a character:\n\nCharacters in theater, television, and film differ from those in novels in that an actor may interpret the writer's description and dialogue in their own unique way to add new layers and depth to a character. This can be seen when critics compare, for example, the 'Lady Macbeths' or 'Heathcliffs' of different actors. Another major difference in drama is that it is not possible to 'go inside the character's head' in the way possible in a novel, meaning this method of character exposition is unavailable. Still another is that in drama, a character usually can be seen and heard and need not be described.\n\nThe psychologist Carl Jung identified twelve primary 'original patterns' of the human psyche. He believed that these reside in the collective subconscious of people across cultural and political boundaries. These twelve archetypes are often cited in fictional characters. 'Flat' characters may be considered so because they stick to a single archetype without deviating, whereas 'complex' or 'realistic' characters will combine several archetypes, with some being more dominant than others ‚Äì as people are in real life.\nJung's twelve archetypes are: the Innocent, the Orphan, the Hero, the Caregiver, the Explorer, the Rebel, the Lover, the Creator, the Jester, the Sage, the Magician, and the Ruler.\n\nA character's voice is his or her manner of speech. Different characters use different vocabularies and rhythms of speech. For example, some characters are talkative, others taciturn. The way a character speaks can be a powerful way of revealing the character‚Äôs personality. In theory, a reader should be able to identify which character is speaking simply from the way he or she talks. When a character voice has been created that is rich and distinctive, the writer can get away with omitting many speech attributions (tag lines). \n\nThe manner of a character‚Äôs speech is to literature what an actor‚Äôs appearance and costume are to cinema. In fiction, what a character says, as well as how he or she says it, makes a strong impression on the reader. Each character should have his or her distinctive voice. To differentiate characters in fiction, the writer must show them doing and saying things, but a character must be defined by more than one single topic of conversation or by the character‚Äôs accent. The character will have other interests or personality quirks as well. Although individual temperament is the largest determinant of what a character says, it is not the only one. The writer can make the characters‚Äô dialogue more realistic and interesting by considering several factors affecting how people speak: ethnicity, family background, region, gender, education, and circumstances. Words characterize by their diction, cadence, complexity, and attitude. Mannerisms and catch-phrases can help too. Considering the degree of formality in spoken language is also useful. Characters who spend a lot of their lives in a more formal setting often use a more formal language all the time, while others never do.\n\n\n\n"}

Cope and Stewardson established the firm in 1885, and were joined by John's brother Emlyn in 1887. It went on to become one of the most influential and prolific firms of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. They made formative additions to the campuses of Bryn Mawr College, Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Washington University in St. Louis. They also designed nine cottages and an administrative building at the Sleighton School, which showed their adaptability to other styles, because their buildings here were Colonial Revival with Federal influences. In 1912, the firm was succeeded by Stewardson and Page formed by Emlyn Stewardson and George Bispham Page.\n\nAlthough Walter Cope and John Stewardson were major exponents of the Collegiate Gothic style which swept campuses across the country in the latter part of the nineteenth century, they were equally adept at other styles. Their first important commission was the main YMCA for Richmond, Virginia (1885‚Äì87), designed in a Richardsonian Romanesque style.\n\nTheir earliest major Collegiate Gothic building was Radnor Hall at Bryn Mawr College (1886), where, ironically, they replaced Cope's mentor Addison Hutton as campus architects. Commissions shortly followed for buildings on the campuses of the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, and Washington University in St. Louis (serving as administrative buildings for the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair). Although these academic buildings were their hallmark, other projects included residential, commercial, institution, and industrial buildings.\n\nThe firm designed Philadelphia buildings for the Harrison brothers, heirs to an enormous sugar-refining fortune. The Charles Custis Harrison Building (1893‚Äì94) was a Richardsonian Romanesque office building at 10th and Market Streets. It was demolished in 1979 to build The Gallery at Market East, an urban shopping mall. Directly north of it was the Harrison Stores (1893‚Äì94), a block-long commercial building and warehouse. This burned in 1984 during a renovation, and was demolished. The Alfred Craven Harrison Building (1894‚Äì95) was a chateauesque hotel and office tower at the southwest corner of 15th and Market Streets, opposite Broad Street Station. Demolished in 1969, the site is now occupied by the Centre Square Building and Claes Oldenburg's \"Clothespin\".\n\nCharles Custis Harrison became provost of the University of Pennsylvania in 1894, and immediately removed Frank Furness as unofficial campus architect, replacing him with Cope & Stewardson. Under Harrison, the university embarked on the biggest building boom in its history, with Cope & Stewardson designing the mammoth Quadrangle dormitories and new buildings for the engineering school, medical school, dental school, veterinary school, law school, zoological labs and English department ‚Äì all clad in Collegiate Gothic. The firm also collaborated with architects Wilson Eyre and Frank Miles Day on the initial phases of the Arts & Crafts-style University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (1895‚Äì99).\n\nAs important as their contribution to the architecture of Philadelphia and its environs is the role which Cope & Stewardson played in architectural education. Great numbers of young apprentices and would-be architects passed their days of training in the office, making it a general stopping place for many architects who would later become famous in their own right. In 1923 the annual T-Square club exhibition catalog published a photograph of the Cope & Stewardson office from about 1899. Included in the number of partners and younger architects are: Walter Cope; John A. MacMahon; James O. Betelle (later of Newark, NJ); Emlyn Stewardson; S. A. Cloud; Wetherill P. Trout; Herbert C. Wise; James P. Jamieson; Eugene S. Powers; E. Perot Bissell; Louise Stavely; Charles H. Bauer (later in Newark, NJ); William Woodburn Potter; John Molitor, Camillo Porecca; and C. Wharton Churchman.\n\nIn 1860, Walter Cope was born in Philadelphia to Thomas P. Cope and Elizabeth Waln Stokes Cope. After graduating from the Germantown Friends School, he attended classes at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1883. In 1885 the firm of Cope & Stewardson was established.\n\nCope was a founding member of the T-Square Club in 1883 and later served as vice-president, secretary, treasurer, president, and as a member of the executive committee. He was also a Professor of Architecture at the University of Pennsylvania from 1892 to 1902. After teaching at Penn, he became a Professor at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. He died after suffering a stroke in 1902.\n\nCope was also part of the investigating committee appointed to study conditions governing the new State Capitol Building competition in 1901. From 1896 to 1898 he was chairman of the committee on the restoration of Independence Hall.\n\nJohn Stewardson, son of Thomas and Margaret Haines Stewardson, was born in 1858. His early education had been in private Christian schools in the Philadelphia area. He continued his studies at Adams Academy in Quincy, Massachusetts from 1873 to 1877. \nAfter graduation, he entered Harvard College, but left in 1878. He briefly continued his studies at the University of Pennsylvania and then joined the Atelier Pascal in Paris, France. In 1882 he returned to Philadelphia, working first in T. P. Chandler's office and then in the office of Frank Furness.\n\nIn 1884 he returned to Europe to travel through Italy and Belgium. A year later, he joined in personal practice with Walter Cope. They were joined in 1887 by John's younger brother Emlyn L. Stewardson, who had recently graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in civil engineering.\n\nIn 1892, Stewardson joined the University of Pennsylvania as staff lecturer in their new School of Architecture. He was also one of the founding members of the T-Square Club, serving in 1885 and 1891 as president of that organization. He also served as treasurer of the Philadelphia Chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) in 1886.\n\nHe is credited with the taste for English Gothic Revival which Cope & Stewardson used in their collegiate buildings. Talbot Hamlin, in his biographical description, for the Dictionary of American Biography notes that, following Stewardson's trip to England in 1894, the buildings at the University of Pennsylvania, which were on the boards at the time, changed from stone structures to brick with stone trim.\n\nStewardson died in 1896 after a skating accident on the Schuylkill River, where he had gone for an afternoon's outing with his friend, the architect Wilson Eyre. Following his funeral his fellow architects established a fund, now known as the prestigious Stewardson Fellowship, which is awarded annually to promising young architects from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to study architecture abroad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalter Cope designed more than a dozen residences in and around Darlington, Maryland.\n\n"}
{"id": "142910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=142910", "title": "Creativity", "text": "Creativity\n\nCreativity is a phenomenon whereby something new and somehow valuable is formed. The created item may be intangible (such as an idea, a scientific theory, a musical composition, or a joke) or a physical object (such as an invention, a literary work, or a painting).\n\nScholarly interest in creativity is found in a number of disciplines, primarily psychology, business studies, and cognitive science, but also education, technology, engineering, philosophy (particularly philosophy of science), theology, sociology, linguistics, and economics, covering the relations between creativity and general intelligence, personality type, mental and neurological processes, mental health, or artificial intelligence; the potential for fostering creativity through education and training; the fostering of creativity for national economic benefit, and the application of creative resources to improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning.\n\nThe lexeme in the English word \"creativity\" comes from the Latin term \"cre≈ç\" \"to create, make\": its derivational suffixes also come from Latin. The word \"create\" appeared in English as early as the 14th century, notably in Chaucer, to indicate divine creation (in The Parson's Tale). However, its modern meaning as an act of human creation did not emerge until after the Enlightenment.\n\nIn a summary of scientific research into creativity, Michael Mumford suggested: \"Over the course of the last decade, however, we seem to have reached a general agreement that creativity involves the production of novel, useful products\" (Mumford, 2003, p.¬†110), or, in Robert Sternberg's words, the production of \"something original and worthwhile\". Authors have diverged dramatically in their precise definitions beyond these general commonalities: Peter Meusburger reckons that over a hundred different analyses can be found in the literature. As an illustration, one definition given by Dr. E. Paul Torrance described it as \"a process of becoming sensitive to problems, deficiencies, gaps in knowledge, missing elements, disharmonies, and so on; identifying the difficulty; searching for solutions, making guesses, or formulating hypotheses about the deficiencies: testing and retesting these hypotheses and possibly modifying and retesting them; and finally communicating the results.\"\n\nTheories of creativity (particularly investigation of why some people are more creative than others) have focused on a variety of aspects. The dominant factors are usually identified as \"the four Ps\" ‚Äî process, product, person, and place (according to Mel Rhodes). A focus on \"process\" is shown in cognitive approaches that try to describe thought mechanisms and techniques for creative thinking. Theories invoking divergent rather than convergent thinking (such as Guilford), or those describing the staging of the creative process (such as Wallas) are primarily theories of creative process. A focus on creative \"product\" usually appears in attempts to measure creativity (psychometrics, see below) and in creative ideas framed as successful memes. The psychometric approach to creativity reveals that it also involves the ability to produce more.\nA focus on the nature of the creative \"person\" considers more general intellectual habits, such as openness, levels of ideation, autonomy, expertise, exploratory behavior, and so on. A focus on \"place\" considers the circumstances in which creativity flourishes, such as degrees of autonomy, access to resources, and the nature of gatekeepers. Creative lifestyles are characterized by nonconforming attitudes and behaviors as well as flexibility.\n\nMost ancient cultures, including thinkers of Ancient Greece, Ancient China, and Ancient India, lacked the concept of creativity, seeing art as a form of discovery and not creation. The ancient Greeks had no terms corresponding to \"to create\" or \"creator\" except for the expression \"poiein\" (\"to make\"), which only applied to \"poiesis\" (poetry) and to the \"poietes\" (poet, or \"maker\") who made it. Plato did not believe in art as a form of creation. Asked in \"The Republic\", \"Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?\", he answers, \"Certainly not, he merely imitates.\"\n\nIt is commonly argued that the notion of \"creativity\" originated in Western culture through Christianity, as a matter of divine inspiration. According to the historian Daniel J. Boorstin, \"the early Western conception of creativity was the Biblical story of creation given in the \"Genesis\".\" However, this is not creativity in the modern sense, which did not arise until the Renaissance. In the Judaeo-Christian tradition, creativity was the sole province of God; humans were not considered to have the ability to create something new except as an expression of God's work. A concept similar to that of Christianity existed in Greek culture, for instance, Muses were seen as mediating inspiration from the Gods. Romans and Greeks invoked the concept of an external creative \"daemon\" (Greek) or \"genius\" (Latin), linked to the sacred or the divine. However, none of these views are similar to the modern concept of creativity, and the individual was not seen as the cause of creation until the Renaissance. It was during the Renaissance that creativity was first seen, not as a conduit for the divine, but from the abilities of \"great men\".\n\nThe rejection of creativity in favor of discovery and the belief that individual creation was a conduit of the divine would dominate the West probably until the Renaissance and even later. The development of the modern concept of creativity begins in the Renaissance, when creation began to be perceived as having originated from the abilities of the individual, and not God. This could be attributed to the leading intellectual movement of the time, aptly named humanism, which developed an intensely human-centric outlook on the world, valuing the intellect and achievement of the individual. From this philosophy arose the Renaissance man (or polymath), an individual who embodies the principals of humanism in their ceaseless courtship with knowledge and creation. One of the most well-known and immensely accomplished examples is Leonardo da Vinci.\n\nHowever, this shift was gradual and would not become immediately apparent until the Enlightenment. By the 18th century and the Age of Enlightenment, mention of creativity (notably in aesthetics), linked with the concept of imagination, became more frequent. In the writing of Thomas Hobbes, imagination became a key element of human cognition; William Duff was one of the first to identify imagination as a quality of genius, typifying the separation being made between talent (productive, but breaking no new ground) and genius.\n\nAs a direct and independent topic of study, creativity effectively received no attention until the 19th century. Runco and Albert argue that creativity as the subject of proper study began seriously to emerge in the late 19th century with the increased interest in individual differences inspired by the arrival of Darwinism. In particular, they refer to the work of Francis Galton, who through his eugenicist outlook took a keen interest in the heritability of intelligence, with creativity taken as an aspect of genius.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, leading mathematicians and scientists such as Hermann von Helmholtz (1896) and Henri Poincar√© (1908) began to reflect on and publicly discuss their creative processes.\n\nThe insights of Poincar√© and von Helmholtz were built on in early accounts of the creative process by pioneering theorists such as Graham Wallas and Max Wertheimer. In his work \"Art of Thought\", published in 1926, Wallas presented one of the first models of the creative process. In the Wallas stage model, creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of 5 stages:\nWallas' model is often treated as four stages, with \"intimation\" seen as a sub-stage.\n\nWallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the evolutionary process, which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments. Simonton provides an updated perspective on this view in his book, \"Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity\".\n\nIn 1927, Alfred North Whitehead gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh, later published as \"Process and Reality.\" He is credited with having coined the term \"creativity\" to serve as the ultimate category of his metaphysical scheme: \"Whitehead actually coined the term ‚Äì our term, still the preferred currency of exchange among literature, science, and the arts. . . a term that quickly became so popular, so omnipresent, that its invention within living memory, and by Alfred North Whitehead of all people, quickly became occluded\".\n\nThe formal psychometric measurement of creativity, from the standpoint of orthodox psychological literature, is usually considered to have begun with J. P. Guilford's 1950 address to the American Psychological Association, which helped popularize the topic and focus attention on a scientific approach to conceptualizing creativity. (It should be noted that the London School of Psychology had instigated psychometric studies of creativity as early as 1927 with the work of H. L. Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination, but it did not have the same impact.) Statistical analysis led to the recognition of creativity (as measured) as a separate aspect of human cognition to IQ-type intelligence, into which it had previously been subsumed. Guilford's work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ, the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down.\n\nJames C. Kaufman and Beghetto introduced a \"four C\" model of creativity; \"mini-c\" (\"transformative learning\" involving \"personally meaningful interpretations of experiences, actions, and insights\"), \"little-c\" (everyday problem solving and creative expression), \"Pro-C\" (exhibited by people who are professionally or vocationally creative though not necessarily eminent) and \"Big-C\" (creativity considered great in the given field). This model was intended to help accommodate models and theories of creativity that stressed competence as an essential component and the historical transformation of a creative domain as the highest mark of creativity. It also, the authors argued, made a useful framework for analyzing creative processes in individuals.\n\nThe contrast of terms \"Big C\" and \"Little c\" has been widely used. Kozbelt, Beghetto and Runco use a little-c/Big-C model to review major theories of creativity. Margaret Boden distinguishes between h-creativity (historical) and p-creativity (personal).\n\nRobinson and Anna Craft have focused on creativity in a general population, particularly with respect to education. Craft makes a similar distinction between \"high\" and \"little c\" creativity. and cites Ken Robinson as referring to \"high\" and \"democratic\" creativity. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi has defined creativity in terms of those individuals judged to have made significant creative, perhaps domain-changing contributions. Simonton has analysed the career trajectories of eminent creative people in order to map patterns and predictors of creative productivity.\n\nThere has been much empirical study in psychology and cognitive science of the processes through which creativity occurs. Interpretation of the results of these studies has led to several possible explanations of the sources and methods of creativity.\n\nIncubation is a temporary break from creative problem solving that can result in insight. There has been some empirical research looking at whether, as the concept of \"incubation\" in Wallas' model implies, a period of interruption or rest from a problem may aid creative problem-solving. Ward lists various hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why incubation may aid creative problem-solving, and notes how some empirical evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that incubation aids creative problem-solving in that it enables \"forgetting\" of misleading clues. Absence of incubation may lead the problem solver to become fixated on inappropriate strategies of solving the problem. This work disputes the earlier hypothesis that creative solutions to problems arise mysteriously from the unconscious mind while the conscious mind is occupied on other tasks. \nThis earlier hypothesis is discussed in Csikszentmihalyi's five phase model of the creative process which describes incubation as a time that your unconscious takes over. This allows for unique connections to be made without your consciousness trying to make logical order out of the problem.\n\nJ. P. Guilford drew a distinction between convergent and divergent production (commonly renamed convergent and divergent thinking). Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single, correct solution to a problem, whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem. Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychology literature. Other researchers have occasionally used the terms \"flexible\" thinking or fluid intelligence, which are roughly similar to (but not synonymous with) creativity.\n\nIn 1992, Finke et al. proposed the \"Geneplore\" model, in which creativity takes place in two phases: a generative phase, where an individual constructs mental representations called preinventive structures, and an exploratory phase where those structures are used to come up with creative ideas. Some evidence shows that when people use their imagination to develop new ideas, those ideas are heavily structured in predictable ways by the properties of existing categories and concepts. Weisberg argued, by contrast, that creativity only involves ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordinary results.\n\nHelie and Sun recently proposed a unified framework for understanding creativity in problem solving, namely the Explicit‚ÄìImplicit Interaction (EII) theory of creativity. This new theory constitutes an attempt at providing a more unified explanation of relevant phenomena (in part by reinterpreting/integrating various fragmentary existing theories of incubation and insight).\n\nThe EII theory relies mainly on five basic principles, namely:\nA computational implementation of the theory was developed based on the CLARION cognitive architecture and used to simulate relevant human data. This work represents an initial step in the development of process-based theories of creativity encompassing incubation, insight, and various other related phenomena.\n\nIn \"The Act of Creation\", Arthur Koestler introduced the concept of \"bisociation\" ‚Äî that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference. This idea was later developed into conceptual blending. In the 1990s, various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with metaphor, analogy, and structure mapping have been converging, and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science, art and humor has emerged under the label conceptual blending.\n\nHoning theory, developed principally by psychologist Liane Gabora, posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing, self-mending nature of a worldview. The creative process is a way in which the individual hones (and re-hones) an integrated worldview. Honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process. When faced with a creatively demanding task, there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview. The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview, and the worldview changes through interaction with the task. This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete, at which point not only is the task conceived of differently, but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components, whether they be ideas, attitudes, or bits of knowledge.\n\nA central feature of honing theory is the notion of a potentiality state. Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly ‚Äòmutating‚Äô predefined possibilities, but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory. Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences, but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task. Thus the creative idea may feel ‚Äòhalf-baked‚Äô. It is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state, because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with.\n\nHoning theory is held to explain certain phenomena not dealt with by other theories of creativity, for example, how different works by the same creator are observed in studies to exhibit a recognizable style or 'voice' even through in different creative outlets. This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise, but it is predicted by honing theory, according to which personal style reflects the creator's uniquely structured worldview. Another example is in the environmental stimulus for creativity. Creativity is commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive, nurturing, trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization. However, research shows that creativity is also associated with childhood adversity, which would stimulate honing.\n\nIn everyday thought, people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think \"if only...\". Their counterfactual thinking is viewed as an example of everyday creative processes. It has been proposed that the creation of counterfactual alternatives to reality depends on similar cognitive processes to rational thought.\n\nThere was a \"creativity quotient\" developed similar to the intelligence quotient (IQ). It makes use of the results of divergent thinking tests (see below) by processing them further. It gives more weight to ideas that are radically different from other ideas in the response.\n\nJ. P. Guilford's group, which pioneered the modern psychometric study of creativity, constructed several tests to measure creativity in 1967:\n\nBuilding on Guilford's work, Torrance developed the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking in 1966. They involved simple tests of divergent thinking and other problem-solving skills, which were scored on:\n\nSuch tests, sometimes called \"Divergent Thinking (DT)\" tests have been both supported and criticized.<ref name=\"doi10.1080/10400419.2011.545713\"></ref>\n\nConsiderable progress has been made in automated scoring of divergent thinking tests using semantic approach. When compared to human raters, NLP techniques were shown to be reliable and valid in scoring the originality. The reported computer programs were able to achieve a correlation of 0.60 and 0.72 respectively to human graders.\n\nSemantic networks were also used to devise originality scores that yielded significant correlations with socio-personal measures. Most recently, an NSF-funded team of researchers led by James C. Kaufman and Mark A. Runco combined expertise in creativity research, natural language processing, computational linguistics, and statistical data analysis to devise a scalable system for computerized automated testing (SparcIt Creativity Index Testing system). This system enabled automated scoring of DT tests that is reliable, objective, and scalable, thus addressing most of the issues of DT tests that had been found and reported. The resultant computer system was able to achieve a correlation of 0.73 to human graders.\n\nSome researchers have taken a social-personality approach to the measurement of creativity. In these studies, personality traits such as independence of judgement, self-confidence, attraction to complexity, aesthetic orientation, and risk-taking are used as measures of the creativity of individuals. A meta-analysis by Gregory Feist showed that creative people tend to be \"more open to new experiences, less conventional and less conscientious, more self-confident, self-accepting, driven, ambitious, dominant, hostile, and impulsive.\" Openness, conscientiousness, self-acceptance, hostility, and impulsivity had the strongest effects of the traits listed. Within the framework of the Big Five model of personality, some consistent traits have emerged. Openness to experience has been shown to be consistently related to a whole host of different assessments of creativity. Among the other Big Five traits, research has demonstrated subtle differences between different domains of creativity. Compared to non-artists, artists tend to have higher levels of openness to experience and lower levels of conscientiousness, while scientists are more open to experience, conscientious, and higher in the confidence-dominance facets of extraversion compared to non-scientists.\n\nAn alternative are biographical methods. These methods use quantitative characteristics such as the number of publications, patents, or performances of a work. While this method was originally developed for highly creative personalities, today it is also available as self-report questionnaires supplemented with frequent, less outstanding creative behaviors such as writing a short story or creating your own recipes. For example, the Creative Achievement Questionnaire, a self-report test that measures creative achievement across 10 domains, was described in 2005 and shown to be reliable and valid when compared to other measures of creativity and to independent evaluation of creative output. Besides the English original, it was also used in a Chinese, French, and German-speaking version. It is the self-report questionnaire most frequently used in research.\n\nThe potential relationship between creativity and intelligence has been of interest since the late 1900s, when a multitude of influential studies ‚Äì from Getzels & Jackson, Barron, Wallach & Kogan, and Guilford ‚Äì focused not only on creativity, but also on intelligence. This joint focus highlights both the theoretical and practical importance of the relationship: researchers are interested not only if the constructs are related, but also how and why.\n\nThere are multiple theories accounting for their relationship, with the 3 main theories as follows:\n\n\nSternberg and O‚ÄôHara proposed a framework of 5 possible relationships between creativity and intelligence:\n\nA number of researchers include creativity, either explicitly or implicitly, as a key component of intelligence.\n\n\"Examples of theories that include creativity as a subset of intelligence\"\n\n\nIn this relationship model, intelligence is a key component in the development of creativity.\n\n\"Theories of creativity that include intelligence as a subset of creativity\"\n\n\nThis possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct, but intersecting constructs.\n\n\"Theories that include Creativity and Intelligence as Overlapping Yet Distinct Constructs\"\n\n\nIn support of the TT, Barron reported finding a non-significant correlation between creativity and intelligence in a gifted sample; and a significant correlation in a non-gifted sample. Yamamoto in a sample of secondary school children, reported a significant correlation between creativity and intelligence of \"r\" = .3, and reported no significant correlation when the sample consisted of gifted children. Fuchs-Beauchamp et al. in a sample of preschoolers found that creativity and intelligence correlated from \"r\" = .19 to \"r\" = .49 in the group of children who had an IQ below the threshold; and in the group above the threshold, the correlations were \"r\" = <.12. Cho et al. reported a correlation of .40 between creativity and intelligence in the average IQ group of a sample of adolescents and adults; and a correlation of close to \"r\" = .0 for the high IQ group. Jauk et al. found support for the TT, but only for measures of creative potential; not creative performance.\n\nMuch modern day research reports findings against TT. Wai et al. in a study using data from the longitudinal Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth ‚Äì a cohort of elite students from early adolescence into adulthood ‚Äì found that differences in SAT scores at age 13 were predictive of creative real-life outcomes 20 years later. Kim‚Äôs meta-analysis of 21 studies did not find any supporting evidence for TT, and instead negligible correlations were reported between intelligence, creativity, and divergent thinking both below and above IQ's of 120. Preckel et al., investigating fluid intelligence and creativity, reported small correlations of \"r\" = .3 to \"r\" = .4 across all levels of cognitive ability.\n\nUnder this view, researchers posit that there are no differences in the mechanisms underlying creativity in those used in normal problem solving; and in normal problem solving, there is no need for creativity. Thus, creativity and Intelligence (problem solving) are the same thing. Perkins referred to this as the ‚Äònothing-special‚Äô view.\n\nWeisberg & Alba examined problem solving by having participants complete the 9-dot problem (see Thinking outside the box#Nine dots puzzle) ‚Äì where the participants are asked to connect all 9 dots in the 3 rows of 3 dots using 4 straight lines or less, without lifting their pen or tracing the same line twice. The problem can only be solved if the lines go outside the boundaries of the square of dots. Results demonstrated that even when participants were given this insight, they still found it difficult to solve the problem, thus showing that to successfully complete the task it is not just insight (or creativity) that is required.\n\nIn this view, creativity and intelligence are completely different, unrelated constructs.\n\nGetzels and Jackson administered 5 creativity measures to a group of 449 children from grades 6-12, and compared these test findings to results from previously administered (by the school) IQ tests. They found that the correlation between the creativity measures and IQ was \"r\" = .26. The high creativity group scored in the top 20% of the overall creativity measures, but were not included in the top 20% of IQ scorers. The high intelligence group scored the opposite: they scored in the top 20% for IQ, but were outside the top 20% scorers for creativity, thus showing that creativity and intelligence are distinct and unrelated.\n\nHowever, this work has been heavily criticised. Wallach and Kogan highlighted that the creativity measures were not only weakly related to one another (to the extent that they were no more related to one another than they were with IQ), but they seemed to also draw upon non-creative skills. McNemar noted that there were major measurement issues, in that the IQ scores were a mixture from 3 different IQ tests.\n\nWallach and Kogan administered 5 measures of creativity, each of which resulted in a score for originality and fluency; and 10 measures of general intelligence to 151 5th grade children. These tests were untimed, and given in a game-like manner (aiming to facilitate creativity). Inter-correlations between creativity tests were on average \"r\" = .41. Inter-correlations between intelligence measures were on average \"r\" = .51 with each other. Creativity tests and intelligence measures correlated \"r\" = .09.\n\nThe neuroscience of creativity looks at the operation of the brain during creative behaviour. It has been addressed in the article \"Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms.\" The authors write that \"creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected.\" Highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways:\n\nThus, the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the cortex that is most important for creativity.\n\nThis article also explored the links between creativity and sleep, mood and addiction disorders, and depression.\n\nIn 2005, Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive. Drawing from evidence in brain imaging, drug studies and lesion analysis, she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes, the temporal lobes, and dopamine from the limbic system. The frontal lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation, and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation. Abnormalities in the frontal lobe (such as depression or anxiety) generally decrease creativity, while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity. High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe, and vice versa. High dopamine levels increase general arousal and goal directed behaviors and reduce latent inhibition, and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas. A 2015 study on creativity found that it involves the interaction of multiple neural networks, including those that support associative thinking, along with other default mode network functions.\n\nVandervert described how the brain's frontal lobes and the cognitive functions of the cerebellum collaborate to produce creativity and innovation. Vandervert's explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of working memory (responsible for processing all thought) are adaptively modeled for increased efficiency by the cerebellum. The cerebellum (consisting of 100 billion neurons, which is more than the entirety of the rest of the brain) is also widely known to adaptively model all bodily movement for efficiency. The cerebellum's adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes where creative and innovative thoughts arise. (Apparently, creative insight or the \"aha\" experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe.)\n\nAccording to Vandervert, the details of creative adaptation begin in \"forward\" cerebellar models which are anticipatory/exploratory controls for movement and thought. These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control (HMOSAIC). New, hierarchically arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture (HMOSAIC) develop as mental mulling in working memory is extended over time. These new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes. Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion, Vandervert's approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports, art, music, the design of video games, technology, mathematics, the child prodigy, and thought in general.\n\nEssentially, Vandervert has argued that when a person is confronted with a challenging new situation, visual-spatial working memory and speech-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed (fractionated) by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation. With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations, the cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem. Most recently, he has argued that this is the same process (only involving visual-spatial working memory and pre-language vocalization) that led to the evolution of language in humans. Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers have pointed out that this blending process, because it continuously optimizes efficiencies, constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas, music, art, or technology. Prototyping, they argue, not only produces new products, it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself. Further, Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers believe that this repetitive \"mental prototyping\" or mental rehearsal involving the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex explains the success of the self-driven, individualized patterning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of the Khan Academy. The model proposed by Vandervert has, however, received incisive critique from several authors.\n\nCreativity involves the forming of associative elements into new combinations that are useful or meet some requirement. Sleep aids this process. REM rather than NREM sleep appears to be responsible. This has been suggested to be due to changes in cholinergic and noradrenergic neuromodulation that occurs during REM sleep. During this period of sleep, high levels of acetylcholine in the hippocampus suppress feedback from the hippocampus to the neocortex, and lower levels of acetylcholine and norepinephrine in the neocortex encourage the spread of associational activity within neocortical areas without control from the hippocampus. This is in contrast to waking consciousness, where higher levels of norepinephrine and acetylcholine inhibit recurrent connections in the neocortex. It is proposed that REM sleep adds creativity by allowing \"neocortical structures to reorganize associative hierarchies, in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes.\"\n\nSome theories suggest that creativity may be particularly susceptible to affective influence. As noted in voting behavior, the term \"affect\" in this context can refer to liking or disliking key aspects of the subject in question. This work largely follows from findings in psychology regarding the ways in which affective states are involved in human judgment and decision-making.\n\nAccording to Alice Isen, positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive activity:\n\nBarbara Fredrickson in her broaden-and-build model suggests that positive emotions such as joy and love broaden a person's available repertoire of cognitions and actions, thus enhancing creativity.\n\nAccording to these researchers, positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for association (attention scope) and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem (cognitive scope).\n\nVarious meta-analyses, such as Baas et al. (2008) of 66 studies about creativity and affect support the link between creativity and positive affect.\n\nJ√ºrgen Schmidhuber's formal theory of creativity postulates that creativity, curiosity, and interestingness are by-products of a simple computational principle for measuring and optimizing learning progress. Consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own sensory inputs. The agent can use a black box optimization method such as reinforcement learning to learn (through informed trial and error) sequences of actions that maximize the expected sum of its future reward signals. There are extrinsic reward signals for achieving externally given goals, such as finding food when hungry. But Schmidhuber's objective function to be maximized also includes an additional, intrinsic term to model \"wow-effects.\" This non-standard term motivates purely creative behavior of the agent even when there are no external goals. A wow-effect is formally defined as follows. As the agent is creating and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs, it keeps improving the predictor or encoder, which can be implemented as an artificial neural network or some other machine learning device that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance over time. The improvements can be measured precisely, by computing the difference in computational costs (storage size, number of required synapses, errors, time) needed to encode new observations before and after learning. This difference depends on the encoder's present subjective knowledge, which changes over time, but the theory formally takes this into account. The cost difference measures the strength of the present \"wow-effect\" due to sudden improvements in data compression or computational speed. It becomes an intrinsic reward signal for the action selector. The objective function thus motivates the action optimizer to create action sequences causing more wow-effects. Irregular, random data (or noise) do not permit any wow-effects or learning progress, and thus are \"boring\" by nature (providing no reward). Already known and predictable regularities also are boring. Temporarily interesting are only the initially unknown, novel, regular patterns in both actions and observations. This motivates the agent to perform continual, open-ended, active, creative exploration.\n\nAccording to Schmidhuber, his objective function explains the activities of scientists, artists, and comedians.\nFor example, physicists are motivated to create experiments leading to observations obeying previously unpublished physical laws permitting better data compression. Likewise, composers receive intrinsic reward for creating non-arbitrary melodies with unexpected but regular harmonies that permit wow-effects through data compression improvements.\nSimilarly, a comedian gets intrinsic reward for \"inventing a novel joke with an unexpected punch line, related to the beginning of the story in an initially unexpected but quickly learnable way that also allows for better compression of the perceived data.\"\nSchmidhuber argues that ongoing computer hardware advances will greatly scale up rudimentary artificial scientists and artists based on simple implementations of the basic principle since 1990.\nHe used the theory to create low-complexity art and an attractive human face.\n\nA study by psychologist J. Philippe Rushton found creativity to correlate with intelligence and psychoticism. Another study found creativity to be greater in schizotypal than in either normal or schizophrenic individuals. While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the prefrontal cortex, schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their \"right\" prefrontal cortex. This study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres, allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate. In agreement with this hypothesis, ambidexterity is also associated with schizotypal and schizophrenic individuals. Three recent studies by Mark Batey and Adrian Furnham have demonstrated the relationships between schizotypal and hypomanic personality and several different measures of creativity.\n\nParticularly strong links have been identified between creativity and mood disorders, particularly manic-depressive disorder (a.k.a. bipolar disorder) and depressive disorder (a.k.a. unipolar disorder). In \"Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament\", Kay Redfield Jamison summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in writers, poets, and artists. She also explores research that identifies mood disorders in such famous writers and artists as Ernest Hemingway (who shot himself after electroconvulsive treatment), Virginia Woolf (who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on), composer Robert Schumann (who died in a mental institution), and even the famed visual artist Michelangelo. A different case study suggested for Schumann a difference between bipolar disorder and \"creative bipolarity\".\n\nA study looking at 300,000 persons with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or unipolar depression, and their relatives, found overrepresentation in creative professions for those with bipolar disorder as well as for undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. There was no overall overrepresentation, but overrepresentation for artistic occupations, among those diagnosed with schizophrenia. There was no association for those with unipolar depression or their relatives. Another case study suggested a difference between severe mood disorders and \"creative melancholy\", pointing out mild and moderate depression may inspire creative achievements while severe depression inhibits and may even destroy creative activity.\n\nAnother study involving more than one million people, conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute, reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses. Writers had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, unipolar depression, and substance abuse, and were almost twice as likely as the general population to kill themselves. Dancers and photographers were also more likely to have bipolar disorder.\n\nHowever, as a group, those in the creative professions were no more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders than other people, although they were more likely to have a close relative with a disorder, including anorexia and, to some extent, autism, the Journal of Psychiatric Research reports.\n\nAccording to psychologist Robert Epstein, PhD, creativity can be obstructed through stress.\n\nCreativity can be expressed in a number of different forms, depending on unique people and environments. A number of different theorists have suggested models of the creative person. One model suggests that there are kinds to produce growth, innovation, speed, etc. These are referred to as the four \"Creativity Profiles\" that can help achieve such goals.\n\nResearch by Dr Mark Batey of the Psychometrics at Work Research Group at Manchester Business School has suggested that the creative profile can be explained by four primary creativity traits with narrow facets within each\n\nThis model was developed in a sample of 1000 working adults using the statistical techniques of Exploratory Factor Analysis followed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis by Structural Equation Modelling.\n\nAn important aspect of the creativity profiling approach is to account for the tension between predicting the creative profile of an individual, as characterised by the psychometric approach, and the evidence that team creativity is founded on diversity and difference.\n\nOne characteristic of creative people, as measured by some psychologists, is what is called \"divergent production\". \"Divergent production\" is the ability of a person to generate a diverse assortment, yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation. One way of measuring \"divergent production\" is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity, quantity, and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions.\n\nOther researchers of creativity see the difference in creative people as a cognitive process of dedication to problem solving and developing expertise in the field of their creative expression. Hard working people study the work of people before them and within their current area, become experts in their fields, and then have the ability to add to and build upon previous information in innovative and creative ways. In a study of projects by design students, students who had more knowledge on their subject on average had greater creativity within their projects.\n\nThe aspect of motivation within a person's personality may predict creativity levels in the person. Motivation stems from two different sources, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a person to participate or invest as a result of personal interest, desires, hopes, goals, etc. Extrinsic motivation is a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment, rewards, fame, approval from others, etc. Although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases, strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people.\n\nFrom a personality-traits perspective, there are a number of traits that are associated with creativity in people. Creative people tend to be more open to new experiences, are more self-confident, are more ambitious, self-accepting, impulsive, driven, dominant, and hostile, compared to people with less creativity.\n\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, creativity may be a result of the outcome of years of generating ideas. As ideas are continuously generated, the need to evolve produces a need for new ideas and developments. As a result, people have been creating and developing new, innovative, and creative ideas to build our progress as a society.\n\nIn studying exceptionally creative people in history, some common traits in lifestyle and environment are often found. Creative people in history usually had supportive parents, but rigid and non-nurturing. Most had an interest in their field at an early age, and most had a highly supportive and skilled mentor in their field of interest. Often the field they chose was relatively uncharted, allowing for their creativity to be expressed more in a field with less previous information. Most exceptionally creative people devoted almost all of their time and energy into their craft, and after about a decade had a creative breakthrough of fame. Their lives were marked with extreme dedication and a cycle of hard-work and breakthroughs as a result of their determination.\n\nAnother theory of creative people is the \"investment theory of creativity\". This approach suggest that there are many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity. In the \"investment\" sense, a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that has been overlooked by others. The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea to the point that it is established as a new and creative idea. Just like in the financial world, some investments are worth the buy in, while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected. This \"investment theory of creativity\" views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others, by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way.\n\nMalevolent creativity (MC) focuses on the \"darker side\" of creativity. This type of creativity is not typically accepted within society and is defined by the intention to cause harm to others through original and innovative means. MC should be distinguished from negative creativity in that negative creativity may unintentionally cause harm to others, whereas MC is explicitly malevolently motivated. MC is often a key contributor to crime and in its most destructive form can even manifest as terrorism. However, MC can also be observed in ordinary day-to-day life as lying, cheating and betrayal. Although everyone shows some levels of MC under certain conditions, those that have a higher propensity towards malevolent creativity have increased tendencies to deceive and manipulate others to their own gain. Although levels of MC appear to dramatically increase when an individual is placed under unfair conditions, personality is also a key predictor in anticipating levels of malevolent thinking. Researches Harris and Reiter-Palmon investigated the role of aggression in levels of MC, in particular levels of implicit aggression and the tendency to employ aggressive actions in response to problem solving. The personality traits of physical aggression, conscientiousness, emotional intelligence and implicit aggression all seem to be related with MC. Harris and Reiter-Palmon's research showed that when subjects were presented with a problem that triggered malevolent creativity, participants high in implicit aggression and low in premeditation expressed the largest number of malevolently-themed solutions. When presented with the more benign problem that triggered prosocial motives of helping others and cooperating, those high in implicit aggression, even if they were high in impulsiveness, were far less destructive in their imagined solutions. They concluded premeditation, more than implicit aggression controlled an individual‚Äôs expression of malevolent creativity.\n\nThe current measure for malevolent creativity is the 13 item test Malevolent Creativity Behaviour Scale (MCBS) \n\nMalevolent creativity has strong links with crime. As creativity requires deviating from the conventional, there is a permanent tension between being creative and producing products that go too far and in some cases to the point of breaking the law. Aggression is a key predictor of malevolent creativity, and studies have also shown that increased levels of aggression also correlates to a higher likelihood of committing crime.\n\nCreativity is viewed differently in different countries. For example, cross-cultural research centred on Hong Kong found that Westerners view creativity more in terms of the individual attributes of a creative person, such as their aesthetic taste, while Chinese people view creativity more in terms of the social influence of creative people e.g. what they can contribute to society. Mpofu et al. surveyed 28 African languages and found that 27 had no word which directly translated to 'creativity' (the exception being Arabic). The principle of linguistic relativity, i.e. that language can affect thought, suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for 'creativity' may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages. However, more research would be needed to establish this, and there is certainly no suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less (or more) creative; Africa has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as music, art, and storytelling. Nevertheless, it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa, and there has also been very little research on creativity in Latin America. Creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere, but here again there are cultural differences, even between countries or groups of countries in close proximity. For example, in Scandinavian countries, creativity is seen as an individual attitude which helps in coping with life's challenges, while in Germany, creativity is seen more as a process that can be applied to help solve problems.\n\nIt has been the topic of various research studies to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent. For any given organization, measures of effectiveness vary, depending upon its mission, environmental context, nature of work, the product or service it produces, and customer demands. Thus, the first step in evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself ‚Äî how it functions, how it is structured, and what it emphasizes.\n\nAmabile argued that to enhance creativity in business, three components were needed:\n\nThere are two types of motivation:\n\nSix managerial practices to encourage motivation are:\n\nNonaka, who examined several successful Japanese companies, similarly saw creativity and knowledge creation as being important to the success of organizations. In particular, he emphasized the role that tacit knowledge has to play in the creative process.\n\nIn business, originality is not enough. The idea must also be appropriate‚Äîuseful and actionable. Creative competitive intelligence is a new solution to solve this problem. According to Reijo Siltala it links creativity to innovation process and competitive intelligence to creative workers.\n\nCreativity can be encouraged in people and professionals and in the workplace. It is essential for innovation, and is a factor affecting economic growth and businesses. In 2013, the sociologist Silvia Leal Mart√≠n, using the Innova 3DX method, suggested measuring the various parameters that encourage creativity and innovation: corporate culture, work environment, leadership and management, creativity, self-esteem and optimism, locus of control and learning orientation, motivation, and fear.\n\nSimilarly, social psychologists, organizational scientists, and management scientists who conduct extensive research on the factors that influence creativity and innovation in teams and organizations have developed integrative theoretical models that emphasize the roles of team composition, team processes, and organizational culture, as well as the mutually reinforcing relationships between them in promoting innovation.\n\nThe investigation by Loo (2017) on creative working in the knowledge economy brings together studies of creativity as delineated in this web page. It offers connections with the sections on the ‚Äò‚ÄùFour C‚Äù model‚Äô, ‚ÄòTheories of creative processes‚Äô, ‚ÄòCreativity as a subset of intelligence‚Äô, ‚ÄòCreativity and personality‚Äô, and ‚ÄòIn organisations‚Äô It is the last section that the investigation addresses.\n\nResearch studies of the knowledge economy may be classified into three levels: macro, meso and micro. Macro studies refer to investigations at a societal or transnational dimension. Meso studies focus on organisations. Micro investigations centre on the minutiae workings of workers. There is also an interdisciplinary dimension such as research from businesses (e.g. Burton-Jones, 1999; Drucker, 1999), economics (e.g. Cortada, 1998; Reich, 2001; Florida, 2003), education (e.g. Farrell and Fenwick, 2007; Brown, Lauder and Ashton, 2011), human resource management (e.g. Davenport, 2005), knowledge and organizational management (Alvesson, 2004; Defillippi, Arthur and Lindsay, 2006; Orr, Nutley, Russell, Bain, Hacking and Moran, 2016), sociology, psychology, and knowledge economy-related sectors ‚Äì especially information technology (IT) software (e.g. O‚ÄôRiain, 2004; Nerland, 2008) and advertising (e.g. Grabher, 2004; Lury, 2004) (Loo, 2017).\n\nLoo (2017) studies how individual workers in the knowledge economy use their creativity and know-how in the advertising and IT software sectors. It examines this phenomenon across three developed countries of England, Japan and Singapore to observe global perspectives. Specifically, the study uses qualitative data from semi-structured interviews of the related professionals in the roles of creative directing and copywriting (in advertising), and systems software developing and software programme managing.\n\nThe study offers a conceptual framework (Loo, 2017, p.¬†49) of a two-dimensional matrix of individual and collaborative working styles, and single and multi-contexts. The investigation draws on literature sources from the four disciplines of economics (e.g. Reich, 2001; Quah, 2002), management (e.g. ,Drucker, 1994; Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; von Hippel, 2006), sociology (e.g. Zuboff, 1988; Bell, 1973; Lash and Urry, 1994; Castells, 2000; Knorr Cetina, 2005), and psychology (e.g. Gardner, 1984; Csikszentmihalyi, 1988; Sternberg, Kaufman and Pretz, 2004). The themes arising from the analysis of knowledge work and creativity literature serve to create a distinct theoretical framework of creative knowledge work. These workers apply their cognitive abilities, creative personalities and skill sets in the areas of science, technology, or culture industries to invent or discover new possibilities ‚Äì e.g. a medium, product or service. These work activities may be done individually or collectively. Education, training and ‚Äòencultured environments‚Äô are necessary for the performance of these creative activities. Acts of creativity are viewed as asking new questions over and above those questions asked by an intelligent person, seeking novelty when reviewing a situation (Gardner, 1993), and creating something that is different and novel, i.e. a ‚Äòvariation‚Äô on the idea of existing ideas in a domain (Csikszentmihalyi, 1988). This framework is evidenced by the empirical chapters on the micro-workings of creative workers in the two knowledge economy sectors from global perspectives.\n\nThis investigation identifies a definition of creative work, three types of work and the necessary conditions for it to occur. These workers use a combination of creative applications including anticipatory imagination, problem-solving, problem seeking, and generating ideas and aesthetic sensibilities. Taking aesthetic sensibilities as an example, for a creative director in the advertising industry, it is a visual imagery whether still or moving via a camera lens, and for a software programmer, it is the innovative technical expertise in which the software is written. There are specific creative applications for each of the sectors such as emotional connection in the advertising sector, and the power of expression and sensitivity in the IT software sector. In addition to the creative applications, creative workers require abilities and aptitudes to carry out their roles. Passion for one‚Äôs job is generic. For copywriters, this passion is identified with fun, enjoyment and happiness alongside attributes such as honesty (regarding the product), confidence, and patience in finding the appropriate copy. Knowledge is also required in the disciplines of the humanities (e.g. literature), the creative arts (e.g. painting and music) and technical-related know-how (e.g. mathematics, computer sciences and physical sciences). In the IT software, technical knowledge of computer languages (e.g. C++) is especially significant for programmers whereas the degree of technical expertise may be less for a programme manager, as only knowledge of the relevant language is necessary to understand the issues for communicating with the team of developers and testers.\n\nThere are three types of work. One is intra-sectoral (e.g. ‚Äògeneral sponge‚Äô and ‚Äôin tune with the zeitgeist‚Äô [advertising], and ‚Äòpower of expression‚Äô and ‚Äòsensitivity‚Äô [IT software]). The second is inter-sectoral (e.g. ‚Äòintegration of advertising activities‚Äô [advertising], and ‚Äòautonomous decentralized systems‚Äô [ADS] [IT software]). The third relates to changes in culture/practices in the sectors (e.g. ‚Äòthree-dimensional trust‚Äô and ‚Äògreen credentials‚Äô [advertising], and ‚Äòcollaboration with HEIs and industry‚Äô and ‚ÄòADS system in the Tokyo train operator‚Äô [IT software]).\n\nThe necessary conditions for creative work to exist are a supportive environment such as supportive information, communications and electronic technologies (ICET) infrastructure, training, work environment and education.\n\nThis investigation has implications for lifelong learning of these workers informally and formally. Teaching institutions need to offer multi-disciplinary knowledge of humanities, arts and sciences and it has impacts on the programme structure, delivery approaches and assessments. At a macro level, governments need to offer a rich diet of cultural activities, outdoor activities and sports fixtures that inform potential creative workers in the areas of video gaming and advertising. This study has implications for work organisations that support and encourage collaborative working alongside individual working, offer opportunities to engage in continuous professional development (formally and informally), and foster an environment, which promotes experiential functioning and supports experimentation.\n\nTeam Composition\n\nDiversity between team members‚Äô backgrounds and knowledge can increase team creativity by expanding the total collection of unique information that is available to the team and introducing different perspectives that can integrate in novel ways. However, under some conditions, diversity can also decrease team creativity by making it more difficult for team members to communicate about ideas and causing interpersonal conflicts between those with different perspectives. Thus, the potential advantages of diversity must be supported by appropriate team processes and organizational cultures in order to enhance creativity.\n\nTeam Processes\n\nTeam communication norms, such as respecting others‚Äô expertise, paying attention to others‚Äô ideas, expecting information sharing, tolerating disagreements, negotiating, remaining open to others‚Äô ideas, learning from others, and building on each other‚Äôs ideas, increase team creativity by facilitating the social processes involved with brainstorming and problem solving. Through these processes, team members are able to access their collective pool of knowledge, reach shared understandings, identify new ways of understanding problems or tasks, and make new connections between ideas. Engaging in these social processes also promotes positive team affect, which facilitates collective creativity.\n\nOrganizational Culture\n\nSupportive and motivational environments that create psychological safety by encouraging risk taking and tolerating mistakes increase team creativity as well. Organizations in which help-seeking, help giving, and collaboration are rewarded promote innovation by providing opportunities and contexts in which team processes that lead to collective creativity can occur. Additionally, leadership styles that downplay status hierarchies or power differences within an organization and empower people to speak up about their ideas or opinions also help to create cultures that are conducive to creativity.\n\nEconomic approaches to creativity have focussed on three aspects ‚Äî the impact of creativity on economic growth, methods of modelling markets for creativity, and the maximisation of economic creativity (innovation).\n\nIn the early 20th century, Joseph Schumpeter introduced the economic theory of \"creative destruction\", to describe the way in which old ways of doing things are endogenously destroyed and replaced by the new. Some economists (such as Paul Romer) view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and, consequently, economic growth. Creativity leads to capital, and creative products are protected by intellectual property laws.\n\nMark A. Runco and Daniel Rubenson have tried to describe a \"psychoeconomic\" model of creativity. In such a model, creativity is the product of endowments and active investments in creativity; the costs and benefits of bringing creative activity to market determine the supply of creativity. Such an approach has been criticised for its view of creativity consumption as always having positive utility, and for the way it analyses the value of future innovations.\n\nThe \"creative class\" is seen by some to be an important driver of modern economies. In his 2002 book, \"The Rise of the Creative Class\", economist Richard Florida popularized the notion that regions with \"3 T's of economic development: Technology, Talent and Tolerance\" also have high concentrations of creative professionals and tend to have a higher level of economic development.\n\nSeveral different researchers have proposed methods of increasing the creativity of an individual. Such ideas range from the psychological-cognitive, such as Osborn-Parnes Creative Problem Solving Process, Synectics, science-based creative thinking, Purdue Creative Thinking Program, and Edward de Bono's lateral thinking; to the highly structured, such as TRIZ (the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving) and its variant Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving (developed by the Russian scientist Genrich Altshuller), and Computer-Aided morphological analysis.\n\nDaniel Pink, in his 2005 book \"A Whole New Mind\", repeating arguments posed throughout the 20th century, argues that we are entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important. In this \"conceptual age\", we will need to foster and encourage \"right-directed thinking\" (representing creativity and emotion) over \"left-directed thinking\" (representing logical, analytical thought). However, this simplification of 'right' versus 'left' brain thinking is not supported by the research data.\n\nNickerson provides a summary of the various creativity techniques that have been proposed. These include approaches that have been developed by both academia and industry:\n\nSome see the conventional system of schooling as \"stifling\" of creativity and attempt (particularly in the preschool/kindergarten and early school years) to provide a creativity-friendly, rich, imagination-fostering environment for young children. Researchers have seen this as important because technology is advancing our society at an unprecedented rate and creative problem solving will be needed to cope with these challenges as they arise. In addition to helping with problem solving, creativity also helps students identify problems where others have failed to do so. See the Waldorf School as an example of an education program that promotes creative thought.\n\nPromoting intrinsic motivation and problem solving are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students. Students are more creative when they see a task as intrinsically motivating, valued for its own sake. To promote creative thinking, educators need to identify what motivates their students and structure teaching around it. Providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks.\n\nTeaching students to solve problems that do not have well defined answers is another way to foster their creativity. This is accomplished by allowing students to explore problems and redefine them, possibly drawing on knowledge that at first may seem unrelated to the problem in order to solve it. In adults, mentoring individuals is another way to foster their creativiy. However, the benefits of mentoring creativity apply only to creative contributions considered great in a given field, not to everyday creative expression.\n\nIn the Scottish education system, creativity is identified as a core skillset for learning, life and work and is defined as ‚Äúa process which generates ideas that have value to the individual. It involves looking at familiar things with a fresh eye, examining problems with an open mind, making connections, learning from mistakes and using imagination to explore new possibilities.‚Äù The need to develop a shared language and understanding of creativity and its role across every aspect of learning, teaching and continuous improvement was identified as a necessary aim and a set of four skills is used to allow educators to discuss and develop creativity skills across all subjects and sectors of education ‚Äì curiosity, open‚Äîmindedness, imagination and problem solving. Distinctions are made between creative learning (when learners are using their creativity skills), creative teaching (when educators are using their creativity skills) and creative change (when creativity skills are applied to planning and improvement). Scotland‚Äôs national Creative Learning Plan supports the development of creativity skills in all learners and of educators‚Äô expertise in developing creativity skills. A range of resources have been created to support and assess this including a national review of creativity across learning by Her Majesty‚Äôs Inspectorate for Education. \n\nCreativity has also been identified as one of the key 21st century skills and as one of the Four Cs of 21st century learning by educational leaders and theorists in the United States.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46754025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46754025", "title": "DC Extended Universe", "text": "DC Extended Universe\n\nThe DC Extended Universe (DCEU) is a term used to refer to an American media franchise and shared universe that is centered on a series of superhero films, distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures and based on characters that appear in American comic books by DC Comics. The shared universe, much like the original DC Universe in comic books and the television programs, was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. The films have been in production since 2011 and in that time Warner Bros. has distributed five films. The series has grossed over $3.7 billion at the global box office, currently making it the fourteenth highest-grossing film franchise.\n\nThe films are written and directed by a variety of individuals and feature large, often ensemble, casts. Several actors, including Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa, and Ray Fisher, have appeared in numerous films of the franchise, with continued appearances in sequels planned. In May 2016, DC's chief creative officer Geoff Johns and Warner Bros. executive vice president Jon Berg were appointed to co-run the DC Films division and oversee creative decisions, production and story-arcs in order to create a cohesive overarching plot within the films. In January 2018, Walter Hamada was appointed the president of DC Films, replacing Berg.\n\nThe first film in the DCEU was \"Man of Steel\" (2013) followed by \"\" (2016), \"Suicide Squad\" (2016), \"Wonder Woman\" (2017), \"Justice League\" (2017), and \"Aquaman\" (2018). The franchise will continue with scheduled release dates for \"Shazam!\" in 2019, as well as \"Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn)\" and \"Wonder Woman 1984\" scheduled for release in 2020. A multitude of other projects are in various stages of development.\n\nIn 2002, Wolfgang Petersen was set to direct a \"Batman vs. Superman\" film from a script by Akiva Goldsman. Warner Bros. canceled development to focus on individual Superman and Batman projects after J. J. Abrams submitted another draft for \"Superman: Flyby\". In February 2007, Warner Bros. hired husband and wife duo Michele and Kieran Mulroney to write a script for a \"Justice League\" film. Christian Bale, who starred as Batman in \"Batman Begins\" (2005), was not approached to reprise the role, nor was Brandon Routh, who starred as Superman in \"Superman Returns\" (2006). George Miller was hired to direct the film, reportedly titled \"Justice League Mortal\", with Armie Hammer cast as Batman, D. J. Cotrona as Superman, Adam Brody as Flash, Santiago Cabrera as Aquaman, Common as Green Lantern, Megan Gale as Wonder Woman, Hugh Keays-Byrne as Martian Manhunter and Jay Baruchel as Maxwell Lord. The project was put on indefinite hold in January 2008, after failing to secure tax breaks for filming in Australia, as well as the 2007‚Äì2008 Writers Guild of America strike preventing progress on the script.\n\nIn 2013, a reboot of the \"Superman\" franchise, \"Man of Steel\", was set to lay the groundwork for future DC films. The film contained references to other characters in the DC Universe, so if it were a success, it could launch a shared universe. Days before \"Man of Steel\"s release in June, it was reported that director Zack Snyder and screenwriter David S. Goyer would be returning for a sequel, which was being fast-tracked by Warner Bros. In July, at San Diego Comic-Con, it was revealed that the sequel would include Batman in a main role, thus establishing the shared universe. In October 2014, Warner Bros. announced a slate of ten DC films.\n\nWhile the rival Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) includes television productions, the DC's new crossover film series is a shared continuity for films. Several television series featuring DC characters and storylines have their own shared continuity, frequently referred to as the Arrowverse. DC's chief creative officer Geoff Johns explained DC's difference in approach to Marvel Studios and their cinematic universe, saying, \"We look at it as the multiverse. We have our TV universe and our film universe, but they all co-exist. For us, creatively, it‚Äôs about allowing everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world. Everyone has a vision and you really want to let the visions shine through ... It's just a different approach.\" In June 2015, Warner Bros. president of creative development Greg Silverman expanded on DC's approach to their cinematic universe, saying, \"We ... take these beloved characters and put them in the hands of master filmmakers and make sure they all coordinate with each other. You'll see the difference when you see ... the things that we are working on.\"\n\nIn May 2016, following criticism of \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\", Warner Bros. established a DC Films division with Geoff Johns and Warner Bros. executive vice president Jon Berg as its heads, which oversees production to form a cohesive creative direction for the franchise. DC Films will not be fully autonomous, with Johns reporting to DC president Diane Nelson and Berg reporting to Silverman. Charles Roven was also moved from his day-by-day producer role on future DC films, which he had served since 2005's \"Batman Begins\", to an administrative executive producer role. In December, Silverman was ousted from his role in Warner Bros., and Toby Emmerich was promoted to president and chief content officer, in his place. By January 2017, Johns and Berg reported to Emmerich. Following the financial and critical success of \"Wonder Woman\" in June 2017, Johns stated that moving forward the films will focus on the heart, humor, hope, heroics, and optimism of the characters. DC also decided to begin deemphasizing the shared nature of their films, with Diane Nelson stating, \"Our intention, certainly, moving forward is using the continuity to help make sure nothing is diverging in a way that doesn't make sense, but there's no insistence upon an overall story line or interconnectivity in that universe... Moving forward, you'll see the DC movie universe being a universe, but one that comes from the heart of the filmmaker who's creating them.\" As a result of \"Justice League\"'s underperformance at the box office, Berg left his position by January 2018 and became a production partner with Roy Lee.\n\nIn January 2018, Walter Hamada was appointed the President of DC Films and the new co-runner of the DCEU, replacing Berg. The following month, Chantal Nong was hired as Vice President of the film studio, additionally overseeing the production of the franchise. The pair were hired to oversee the future of the franchise with Johns, as the key production team managers. However, in June of the same year, Johns stepped down from his role as co-head of DC Films and co-runner of the DCEU. He will remain with the studio as co-chairman, while starting his own studio where he will take on a greater hands-on role with film media as a producer and screenwriter. His production company, Mad Ghost Productions, will produce future films in the franchise, as well as comic book and television media.\n\nKal-El / Clark Kent, who arrived on Earth years ago as an infant from Krypton, struggles with why he was sent to Earth. Raised by his adoptive parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent, Clark adopts the persona \"Superman\", and learns if his abilities are meant to maintain peace or conquer the world.\n\nDuring story discussions for \"The Dark Knight Rises\", David S. Goyer told Christopher Nolan his idea regarding how to present Superman in a modern context. Impressed with Goyer's concept, Nolan pitched the idea to the studio, who hired Nolan to produce and Goyer to write based on the financial and critical success of \"The Dark Knight\". Zack Snyder was hired in October 2010 to direct the film. In January 2011, Henry Cavill was cast as Clark Kent / Superman. Other cast members included Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Michael Shannon as the villain General Zod, Diane Lane as Martha Kent, Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent, Russell Crowe as Jor-El, and Laurence Fishburne as Perry White. Principal photography began on August 1, 2011. \"Man of Steel\" released in North America on June 14, 2013.\n\nGotham City-based vigilante Batman travels to Metropolis to preemptively combat Superman, fearing what would happen if the latter is kept unchecked, while another threat endangers humankind.\n\nIn June 2013, it was reported that Snyder and Goyer would be returning for a sequel to \"Man of Steel\", which was being fast-tracked by Warner Bros. Nolan was involved in an advisory role as executive producer. In July, at the San Diego Comic-Con, Warner Bros. announced that Superman and Batman would meet for the first time in a cinematic format in the film, which would be the follow-up to \"Man of Steel\" and a reboot of the \"Batman\" film series. According to Snyder, the film took inspiration from the comic \"The Dark Knight Returns\". Cavill, Adams, Lane, and Fishburne reprised their roles. In August, Ben Affleck was cast as Bruce Wayne / Batman. In December, Gal Gadot was cast as Diana Prince / Wonder Woman, marking the character's first appearance in a live-action theatrical film. Later in the month, Chris Terrio was hired to rewrite Goyer's script. In January 2014, the film was delayed from its July 17, 2015, release date to May 6, 2016, to give the filmmakers \"time to realize fully their vision, given the complex visual nature of the story\". Later that month, Jesse Eisenberg and Jeremy Irons joined the cast as Lex Luthor and Alfred Pennyworth, respectively. In May 2014, the film's title was revealed to be \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\". Initial filming occurred on October 19, 2013, at East Los Angeles College, before full principal photography began on May 21, 2014, in Detroit. Production also took place in Illinois, New Mexico, Africa and the South Pacific. After another date change, the film was released in North America on March 25, 2016.\n\nThe film is set 18 months after the events of \"Man of Steel\". \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\" introduced Ezra Miller as Barry Allen / The Flash, Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry / Aquaman, Ray Fisher as Victor Stone / Cyborg, and Joe Morton as Dr. Silas Stone. The film also introduced Steppenwolf, who served as the main antagonist in \"Justice League\", through a brief scene. The scene was not included in the film's theatrical release, but instead was revealed online by Warner Bros. on March 28, before being included in the \"Ultimate Edition\" home video release.\nAfter the death of Superman, a secret government agency recruits imprisoned supervillains to execute dangerous black ops missions and rescue the world from a powerful threat, in exchange for clemency.\n\nIn February 2009, prior to the development of the DCEU, Warner Bros. was developing a Suicide Squad film, with Dan Lin producing and Justin Marks writing the script. In October 2014, \"Suicide Squad\" was announced by Warner Bros., with David Ayer confirmed as director. In December, it was revealed that Ayer would also be writing the screenplay. The main cast included Will Smith as Deadshot, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Jared Leto as the Joker, Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang, Jay Hernandez as El Diablo, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Killer Croc, Karen Fukuhara as Katana, Cara Delevingne as Enchantress, Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, and Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag.

In April 2014, it was announced that Snyder would return as director. The film was announced in October as \"Justice League Part One\". In March 2016, it was confirmed that Chris Terrio had written the script, who said that the film would not be as tonally dark as \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\". In June, Geoff Johns announced that the title had been changed to simply \"Justice League\". Affleck, Cavill, Gadot, Momoa, Miller, Fisher, Irons, Lane, Adams, Eisenberg, Nielsen, Wright, and Morton reprised their respective roles from previous films. Ciar√°n Hinds provides the voice and performance capture for the villain Steppenwolf. Beginning on April 11, 2016, filming took place at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden, in England, as well as locations around London and in Iceland. Filming concluded in October 2016. In May 2017, Snyder stepped down from his duties on the film due to his daughter's death; Joss Whedon filled his position on post-production, with additional scenes being written and directed by him. Though Whedon was not officially credited for his role as post-production director, he completed enough additional work for a screenwriting credit on the film. \"Justice League\" was released worldwide on November 17, 2017.\n\n\"Justice League\" introduced various characters, including J. K. Simmons as James Gordon, Amber Heard as Mera, and Billy Crudup as Henry Allen; both Kiersey Clemons as Iris West and Willem Dafoe as Nuidis Vulko were to be introduced but their scenes were ultimately cut from the film. Joe Manganiello as Slade Wilson / Deathstroke was also introduced in a post-credits scene, teasing an alliance between him and Lex Luthor.\n\nFollowing the events of \"Justice League\", Arthur Curry / Aquaman must fight to retain the Atlantean throne from opposing threats.\n\nIn June 2014, Jason Momoa was cast as Arthur Curry / Aquaman. By August, Will Beall and Kurt Johnstad were writing competing scripts for the character's solo film. \"Aquaman\" was announced in October. In June 2015, James Wan was hired as director, as well as to oversee the screenplay by Johnstad. The film's plot takes place after the events of \"Justice League\".

Principal photography began on May 2, 2017, in Queensland, Australia, and wrapped on October 21, 2017. \"Aquaman\" is scheduled to be released in North America on December 21, 2018.\n\nIn order to expand and build the universe the films are set in, some additional material has been released, such as additional scenes or bonus material included in the home releases of the films. The purpose of said material is also to set up and tease the overarching narrative that future installments of the franchise will adhere to. In the case of additional scenes, on March 28, 2016, Warner Bros. released to the public via its YouTube channel, a scene not shown in theaters from \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\", titled \"Communion\", which teased the events that would be depicted in \"Justice League\"; the scene was later integrated in the Ultimate Edition home release of the film. Similarly, in the Blu-ray disc home release of \"Wonder Woman\", an epilogue is included in the form of a short titled \"Etta's Mission\", which details a final incident that transpired after the events of the film. Etta teases the existence of a Mother Box, which is crucial to the storyline of \"Justice League\". Also, in the Blu-ray home release of \"Justice League\", two additional scenes not shown in the theatrical cut are included, which further flesh-out the return of Superman and him joining the League.\n\nFurthermore, the various special featurettes and documentaries included in the Blu-ray home releases of the films feature concept arts and designs, as well as background information that greatly expands the shared universe; giving detailed insight into the fictional history, technology, worlds and cultures that appear in the films.\n\nAlthough not all the films in the franchise resort to this practice, some of them make use of post-credits scenes to further develop character relationships and establish the plot elements that will influence future installments, such as \"Suicide Squad\" and \"Justice League\".\n\nBy shouting \"Shazam\", a 14-year-old foster child, Billy Batson, can turn into an adult superhero, courtesy of an ancient wizard. He attempts to master his powers and defeat the evil forces controlled by Doctor Sivana.\n\nIn August 2014, Dwayne Johnson announced his attachment to a project about the superhero Shazam, formerly known as Captain Marvel. In September, Johnson was revealed to be portraying the antihero Black Adam, Shazam's nemesis in the film, with Darren Lemke set to write the script. In October, Warner Bros. announced \"Shazam\" as a film in its upcoming slate. By January 2017, Henry Gayden was working on the script. In July, David F. Sandberg was confirmed as director of the film. It was also confirmed that month that, despite the initial announcement, Dwayne Johnson would not appear as Black Adam in \"Shazam!\", but will instead star in a solo film. Pre-production began with the casting process for Shazam's child-age alter ego Billy Batson in August. By October, Zachary Levi was cast as Shazam. In November, Grace Fulton joined the cast as Shazam's foster sister, Mary Bromfield. Fulton is reteaming with the director after \"\". The film's primary villain will be Doctor Sivana, with actor Mark Strong cast in the role. Later that month, Asher Angel was cast as Billy Batson. In December, Jack Dylan Grazer was cast as Frederick \"Freddy\" Freeman, Batson's foster brother and best friend. Later that month, Jovan Armand, Ian Chen, and Faithe Herman were cast as Batson's foster siblings Pedro Pe√±a, Eugene Choi, and Darla Dudley respectively, while Cooper Andrews and Marta Milans will portray Billy's foster parents. By January 2018, Ron Cephas Jones was in negotiations to portray the wizard, Shazam, who gives Billy his powers, but was replaced by Djimon Hounsou due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nThe film began principal photography in Toronto on January 29, 2018, and wrapped on May 11, 2018, with most of the filming taking place at Pinewood Toronto Studios, among other locations around the city. \"Shazam!\" will be released in North America on April 5, 2019.\n\nBy November 2016, \"Birds of Prey\", based on the female superhero team of the same name, was in development with Christina Hodson signed on as screenwriter. By April 2018, Warner Bros. selected Cathy Yan as director, with Margot Robbie, Sue Kroll, and Bryan Unkless serving as producers for the project. Robbie will reprise her role as Harleen Quinzel / Harley Quinn from \"Suicide Squad\". The film is expected to be the first theatrical R-rated installment in the franchise and will have a smaller budget than most of the other films. In addition to Robbie's starring role, the team roster will also include Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, Rosie Perez, and Ella Jay Basco as Huntress, Black Canary, Renee Montoya, and Cassandra Cain, respectively. Black Mask will serve as the film's primary antagonist with Ewan McGregor portraying the character. The film began pre-production in late July 2018, with principal photography scheduled to commence on January 15, 2019 in Los Angeles under the working title \"Fox Force Five\". In November 2018, Robbie revealed the full title of the film as, \"Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)\". Warner Bros. had the slated film scheduled to be released on February 14, 2020, but \"Birds of Prey\" moved the date forward one week, to February 7, 2020.\n\nBy June 2017, Geoff Johns and Patty Jenkins had begun work on the story treatment for a \"Wonder Woman\" sequel. By July, Johns announced that he is working on the script for the film. That same month, the sequel was officially announced at San Diego Comic-Con. Gadot will reprise her role as Wonder Woman. By September, Jenkins signed a deal to return as director, and brought on David Callaham to pen the script with her and Johns. The film takes place in the 1980s during the Cold War. Jenkins said the film, like its predecessor, will be a love story, but with a new love interest. Pre-production had begun by early December 2017, with filming scheduled to start in June 2018, under the working title \"Magic Hour\". By March 2018, Kristen Wiig was cast to portray the film's primary antagonist, Barbara Ann Minerva / Cheetah. That same month, Pedro Pascal was also cast in a key role.\n\nProduction began on June 13, 2018 around the District of Columbia and Northern Virginia. Other filming locations include the Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden in the United Kingdom and the islands of Tenerife and Fuerteventura in Spain. \"Wonder Woman 1984\" is scheduled to be released in North America on June 5, 2020.\n\nBy July 2013, Greg Berlanti was developing a film that centered around Barry Allen / The Flash. In October 2014, \"The Flash\" was announced with a scheduled 2018 release date. The initial script was drafted by Berlanti, Chris Brancato, Michael Green and Marc Guggenheim. In April 2015, a story treatment was written by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller based on the previous draft, with the intent being that the duo would also direct the film. Over the next two years, Seth Grahame-Smith and Rick Famuyiwa, had individually dropped out of the project due to creative differences with the studio. In January 2017, Joby Harold was hired to do a page-one rewrite of the script, which previously had drafts written by Grahame-Smith and Famuyiwa. In July 2017, the title for the film was changed to \"Flashpoint\", based on the comic book story arc of the same name. \n\nIn March 2018, John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein were hired to direct. Zack Snyder, Alex Gartner, Geoff Johns, Dan Mazer, Richard Suckle, Deborah Snyder, Phil Lord, Chris Miller, Jon Berg, and Denise Di Novi will serve as producers on the project. Dan Mazeau was brought on as co-writer, followed by Grahame-Smith and Brancato as additional screenwriters. Daley and Goldstein had initially announced the release of \"The Flash\" to be sometime during 2020, though production was delayed from April 2019 to later in the same year to allow for additional work on the script. Principal photography will take place in Atlanta, Georgia, and follow in Leavesden, Hertfordshire, England. The tone of the film will be similar to \"Back to the Future\".\n\nIn October 2014, a Batman standalone film was announced by Warner Bros. By 2016, Ben Affleck was set to star in, produce, direct, and write the project. Geoff Johns was hired as co-writer. The film was on track to begin shooting in 2017, until Affleck stepped down as director in January 2017, in order to more efficiently focus on starring as the eponymous role. In February 2017, Warner Bros. announced the title as \"The Batman\" and revealed that Matt Reeves would direct and co-produce the film. By July of that year, Reeves confirmed that the script was being rewritten. The story has reportedly been reworked to focus on Batman earlier on in his career as a vigilante. The film will be character-driven and stylistically noir, and will explore Batman's experiences as the world's greatest detective. Reeves stated that the film will feature this aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous Batman films. In August 2018, Reeves announced that the script is near its final draft, and that principal photography is planned to begin early 2019. Affleck remains attached to the project and will serve as producer alongside Johns. In September 2018, Reeves completed his draft of the script and submitted it to Warner Bros. for approval.\n\nWarner Bros. and DC Films have a variety of DCEU films in varying stages of development.\n\n\nThis table only includes characters that have appeared in multiple DCEU films.\n\n\n"}

Private support of NYCHA programs is welcome given the agency experiencing huge shortfalls in operating and capital funding. The participants create a visual and oral history of daily life that differs from a common media portrayal of NYC housing projects. It may be that NYCHA hopes that Developing Lives can help change the image of those living in the projects.\n\nDeveloping Lives began in the Housing Authority‚Äôs Manhattanville Development in fall 2010 with a handful of participants. The program has by now included residents of 15 of the agency‚Äôs 334 developments. Meanwhile, over 10,000 viewers have seen the photographs online.\n\nDeveloping Lives was brought to NYCHA by former MTA executive George Carrano of the non-profit Seeing For Ourselves, which also arranged the private partnerships behind the program. Carrano had served as curator of photography exhibits of war photojournalism and participatory photography that were lauded in the media as poignant and not to be missed. Chelsea Davis, founder of two participatory arts programs and with family roots in NYC public housing, directs the program. Lily Randall, former art instructor in St. Louis public housing, also helped run Developing Lives.\n\nDeveloping Lives belongs to the school of participatory photography. This school turns the traditional photography paradigm on its head. Those whose normal role is limited to their function as objects of photography receive training to document their own lives. The movement originated in American efforts two decades ago to aid rural Chinese women, who had never used a camera, but now encompasses all efforts to take charge of one's own narrative using photography. Milestones include the NYC exhibit Unbroken by PhotoVoice, a group dedicated to this school of photography. George Carrano served as the show‚Äôs curator.\n\nDeveloping Lives includes weekly sessions in which instructors present a new photography technique (light, shadow, camera language, etc.) and introduce a well-known photographer whose work exemplifies that technical style. The program distributes single-use Kodak cameras at the start of every class which are returned the following week. The film is then processed and photographs reviewed and returned. Participants are asked to bear in mind the new photography technique when documenting their lives throughout the week.\n\nIn addition to teaching technical skills, Developing Lives also helps participants become documentary photographers. The classes discuss the art of storytelling through a photograph. All photographs are paired with handwritten captions from the photographer.\n\nThe Developing Lives photographs were combined with a narrative explaining the challenges faced by residents, and published as Project Lives in April 2015.\n"}

A secondary, common meaning of \"diction\" means the distinctiveness of speech, the art of speaking so that each word is clearly heard and understood to its fullest complexity and extremity, and concerns pronunciation and tone, rather than word choice and style. This secondary sense is more precisely and commonly expressed with the term enunciation, or with its synonym articulation.\n\nDiction has multiple concerns, of which register is foremost‚Äîanother way of saying this is whether words are either formal or informal in the social context. Literary diction analysis reveals how a passage establishes tone and characterization, e.g. a preponderance of verbs relating physical movement suggests an active character, while a preponderance of verbs relating states of mind portrays an introspective character. Diction also has an impact upon word choice and syntax.\n\nAristotle, in The Poetics (20) states that \"Diction comprises eight elements: Phoneme, Syllable, Conjunction, Connective, Noun, Verb, Inflection, and Utterance. However, Epps states that in this passage \"the text is so confused and some of the words have such a variety of meanings that one cannot always be certain what the Greek says, much less what Aristotle means.\"\n\nDiction is usually judged with reference to the prevailing standards of proper writing and speech and is seen as the mark of quality of the writing. It is also understood as the selection of certain words or phrases that become peculiar to a writer.\n\n\nForms of diction include: Archaic Diction (diction that is antique, that is rarely used), High Diction (lofty sounding language), and Low Diction (everyday language). Each of these forms are to enhance the meaning or artistry of an author's work.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25116037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25116037", "title": "Doren Robbins", "text": "Doren Robbins\n\nDoren Robbins (born August 20, 1949 in Los Angeles, California) is a contemporary American poet, prose poet, fiction writer, essayist, mixed media artist, and educator. As a cultural activist, he has organized and developed projects for Amnesty International, the Salvadoran Medical Relief Fund, the Romero Relief Fund, and poetsagainstthewar.org. Robbins has lived most of his life in California and Oregon.\n\nDoren Robbins has published poetry, prose poetry, short fiction, literary criticism and book reviews in over one hundred journals, including \"The American Poetry Review\", \"North Dakota Quarterly\", \"Cimarron Review\", \"Hawaii Review\", \"Indiana Review\", \"International Poetry\", \"Kayak\", \"Onthebus\", \"Paterson Literary Review\", \"Pemmican\", \"Sulfur\", \"New Letters\", \"5 AM\", \"Willow Springs\", and \"Hayden's Ferry Review\". In spring 2008, Eastern Washington University Press published a new book of poems, \"My Piece of the Puzzle\". His previous collection of poetry, \"Driving Face Down\", won the Blue Lynx Prize for Poetry. In 2004, Cedar Hill Publications published \"Parking Lot Mood Swing: Autobiographical Monologues and Prose Poetry\". A mixed media artist as well as a writer, two of his works are currently on exhibit at the Crossing Boundaries: Visual Art by Writers exhibit, held at the Paterson Museum in New Jersey. His collage-portrait of Kenneth Rexroth, \"Angles with Fissures\", appeared in the Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center documentary film, \"Kenneth Rexroth Centennial\".\n\nRobbins has been a teacher of Creative Writing, Poetry, English Composition, Shakespeare, and Multicultural Literature since 1991 at the University of Iowa, UCLA, East Los Angeles Community College, and California State University (Dominguez Hills). He has been awarded three times by the Foothill College Honors Institute for his teaching. Currently he is Professor of Creative Writing and Literature at Foothill College. Robbins was director of the Foothill College Writers' Conference 2003, 2006‚Äì2008.\n\nUnion Institute, BA, 1990. The University of Iowa, MFA, 1993. Two years post-graduate studies in literature, multiculturalism, and criticism at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, 1994‚Äì96.\n\nDoren Robbins began actively publishing poetry in the 1970s. In 1969, while reading Henry Miller's \"The Time of the Assassins\", his study of Arthur Rimbaud, Robbins became aware of Kenneth Rexroth's poetry through Miller's reference to Rexroth's remarkable \"Memorial\" for Dylan Thomas, \"Thou Shalt Not Kill,\" about which Miller stated, \"If one has any doubts about the fate which our society reserves for the poet, let him read this \"'Memorial.'\" During this early period of development Robbins had preceded reading Miller's book on Rimbaud with \"The Diary of Najinsky\", Van Gogh's \"Letters\", Kenneth Patchen's \"The Journal of Albion Moonlight\", Jack Hirschman's \"Artaud Anthology\", and Wilhelm Reich's \"The Murder of Christ\", making the connection to Rexroth's elegy for Thomas timely in the way that it lyrically and convincingly categorizes and specifies the violent multi-faceted alienation of society with the vulnerability and ensuing martyrdom of certain artists. As suggested by Robbins' prose poem monologue \"My Dylan Thomas,\" the Welsh poet was an inspiration and an early influence. At age eighteen Robbins attended a production of Sidney Michaels' \"Dylan: A Play Based On Dylan Thomas In America By John Malcolm Brinnin and Leftover Life To Kill By Caitlin Thomas\". The production was an inspiration adding to Robbins's continuing study of Thomas's poetry with a new emphasis on sound, voice, and prosody in general.\nAfter a five-year period of studying many of the key books of Western literature, philosophy and politics, Robbins decided to search for a way to contact Rexroth who had become‚Äîthrough his essays in \"Bird in the Bush\", \"Classics Revisited\", and \"Assays\"; along with his \"Collected Shorter Poems\", \"Collected Longer Poems\", and his many books of translations‚Äîhis initial literary guide. Robbins discovered from an old friend attending the University of California, Santa Barbara, that Rexroth taught a course in Poetry, Song, and Performance at UCSB. At the evening course, Robbins introduced himself to Rexroth who generously requested he recite his poems during the class performances. For several weeks thereafter Robbins was a visitor-participant in Rexroth's poetry seminar held in his home in Montecito. They remained in contact until Rexroth's death in 1982. The events in 1971, and the ensuing friendship with Rexroth would prove particularly decisive for Robbins' development as a poet and essayist. It was at this time that he re-connected with his old friend; poet, translator, art curator, and publisher John Solt who had become friends with Rexroth and his wife, Carol Tinker.\n\nClearly, as explored in his essay \"The Tropic of Rabelais, the Passage to Whitman: A Note on Poetry and Community\", and his prose poem, \"Sympathetic Manifesto\", honoring the anarchist organizer, lecturer and teacher Voltairine de Clerye, Robbins' working-class political sensibility is not simply one of dissidence and alienation. It could be stated that several of his poems from his earlier collections, such as \"For Pablo Neruda,\" \"Hooker with a Lily\", \"They're Honking at a Woman\", \"The Boss Jack Sterner had a Dream\", \"Collecting Myself\", or the later poems \"My Pico Boulevard\", \"Gregor Samsa's Face\", \"Her Friday\", and his more recent poems \"Dignity in Naples and North Hollywood\", \"Latina Worker\", \"My Piece of the Puzzle\", and \"Before and After Tampico\" display direct parallels to Marx's compassionate diatribe in his chapter \"Alienated Labor\" from the \"Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts\", but the underlying thematics in Robbins' political poems are anarchist variations of the claims he made in the\"...Rabelais...Whitman\" essay alluded to above: Really, if our values are at all valuable, it would be a process of false logic to believe in anything that has to do with the world powers. The very fact that they have the means to help but no active concern for whole populations of unemployed, marginally employed, underfed people‚Äîaside from turning them into submissive robotized satellites of exploitative disgrace‚Äîshows that these powers are an invention of the ethically dispossessed.\"\n\nAgain, as in his \"Neruda\" poem, the notion of legendary individuals takes precedence over the social conditions they have pitted themselves against‚Äîde Clerye as a teacher and organizer is celebrated for her devotion to alleviating economic violence to immigrants and the poor, Neruda for a comparable political consciousness in his poems and his activism in Chilean politics; with Rabelais and Whitman he states that \"we never feel they are artists in the way we understand Antonin Artaud or William Burroughs to be, as understandable as their positions are‚Äîtheir work is almost exclusively a violent depiction of a desperately avaricious and alienated world, it is a literature of revolt, revulsion, and frustrated purgation. With Rabelais and Whitman we have the literature of liberation: imaginative, sexual, worldly, and above all humane\".\n\nUltimately, Robbins' writings containing social issues can not be easily classified. On the one hand, his narrator cogently, even passionately explores and exposes injustices his characters' endure. There is a sense of working-class rage. Moreover, these poems have the effect of elegies to the actual human values abused by the world capitalist system and the various branches of the soviet communist system. However, his conclusions, if there is a remedy to be found in his writings, might be said to be founded in a poetically reductive idealism; for example, he concludes the prose poem \"Sympathetic Manifesto\" with these final lines: \"I will always believe in the Revolution, and in something better: the rarer action, said Prospero, is in Virtue than in Vengeance\" (60). And he concludes his essay on Charles Bukowski by stating that \"To survive without adding to the horror is sometimes the best we can do; it is at least an effort that makes sense as a starting point. There is courage, discipline, and cunning in the effort. Finally, what remains after a poet's survival, which is not an inconsequential matter in our culture‚Äîis the art. In the art of Bukowski the most central theme, both comically and tragically, is simply the passion to exist, to take it as it comes, recount what it was all about, and, paradoxically, recount the butchery done to that passion, and the butchery endured, by humans.\"\n\nFinally, there does not appear to be a consistent \"reductive\" quality in his interpretations and conclusions but a variety of crucial insights and problem-solving or lamentably unsolvable approaches; here his path of interpretative and representative response and expression finds allegiance with Bertolt Brecht in his statement that \"Complex seeing must be practiced.\" Current poems that exemplify his radical working-class, anti-war complexity are \"Predators' Hour2, Open All Night\" and \"Ash Lands.\" Each poem can be found at pemmicanpress.com. Regarding Robbins' poetry, Bill Mohr has stated that\nArt supposedly gives us aesthetic distance. Knowing the limited capacity of art to redeem anybody's suffering, Robbins' poems provide no such obvious safety net. On the other hand, the voice in his poems, with its impeccable contralto of hope and revulsion, reminds us not to accept any limits other than our own resilient skepticism.\nOn his web site, one of the quotes Robbins refers to from Albert Camus concretely supports the paradox of artistic skepticism: \"Art itself could probably not produce the renascence which implies justice and liberty. But without it, that renascence would be without forms and, consequently, would be nothing.\"\n\nInfluenced by several alternative poetry journals of the period, such as George Hitchcock's \"Kayak\", Clayton Eshleman's \"Caterpillar\", and Robert Bly's \"The Seventies\" with its emphases on \"wild association\", political poetry, and critical book reviews, Robbins co-founded the literary Journal, \"Third Rail\" (Los Angeles, CA 1975), with fellow poet Uri Hertz. He co-edited until 1980, remaining as a contributing editor until 1982.\nThe avant-garde of the period had at least two specific modernist traditions. One, was the ongoing longer-poem development of a personal-historical, disjunctive, elliptical, interior monologue and collage form like that of Ezra Pound's \"Cantos\", William Carlos Williams's \"Paterson\", Louis Zukofsky's \"A\", and Charles Olsen's \"The Maximus Poems\". The shorter, lyrical development continued out of the non-referential poems of Gertrude Stein's \"Tender Buttons\", the French \"cubist\" poetry of Pierre Reverdy, and the short, sometimes opaque poems of the American poets George Oppen, the aforementioned Zukofsky, and to a certain extent their inheritors Robert Duncan, Robert Creeley, and the Beat Generation poet Philip Whalen. On the other hand, Beat poets Allen Ginsberg, Harold Norse, and Charles Bukowski carried on the Whitman tradition of the authentic voice, \"I was the man, I suffered, I was there.\" Eshleman's \"Caterpillar\" combined both traditions, including that of European and Latin American surrealism. Similar to George Hitchcok's \"Kayak\" and Eshleman's \"Caterpillar\", Robert Bly's magazine represented an international modernist faction closely related to surrealism, but a surrealism driven by emotional and sociological dynamics forcing the poet to invent a new imagery, not always aligned with rational analysis, as compared to a surrealism of \"automatic writing\" often leaving the reader with an alternate disappointment to that of the game of indeterminacy and abstract expression resulting in the majority of language poets. To this end Bly emphasized the works of Georg Trakl, Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, C√©sar Vallejo and Pablo Neruda in particular. There is a good deal of reductive theorizing and a certain degree of non-substantive depth psychology fantasizing in Bly's arguments, while his own poetry, surreal and otherwise, often struggles with the effects of sentimentality and bathos; however, his influence urging poets toward a more passionate sense of psychoanalytic personal and radical social awareness, imagery and association cannot be underestimated.\nFor Hertz and Robbins, at least up to 1982, it appears the generally mutual focus of \"Third Rail\" was basically connected to the paths \"Kayak\", \"Caterpillar\", and \"The Seventies\" were taking. That is, there was a strong interest in continuing the development of an international poetry, generally written in a language Rexroth himself referred to as \"the international idiom\". From 1975‚Äì1982, \"Third Rail\" published works by Henry Miller, Walter Lowenfels, Kenneth Rexroth, Robert Bly, Jack Micheline, Christopher Buckley, Douglas Blazek, Andrea Hollander Budy, Naomi Shihab Nye, Barbara Szerlip, Kazuko Shiraishi, Takahashi Shinkichi, Paul Eluard, Blaise Cendrars, Pablo Neruda, Juan Armando Epple, Pablo Antonio Cuadra, Natalia Gorbanevskaia, Anna Akhmatova and many lesser known poets. The journal also published special sections on political events, such as \"Poets on Chile, Neruda, Allende\" (1976) and \"Poets Against Nuclear Power\" (1980). Hertz and Robbins conducted interviews with the internationally renowned Japanese poet, Kazuko Shiraishi, and surrealist poet and founder of \"Kayak Press\", George Hitchcock. Robbins regularly published his poems in the journal along with critiques of the poetry of William Pillin, Philip Whalen, Bert Meyers, Clayton Ehsleman, Katerina Gogou, and Carol Tinker.\n\nIn 1994, Robbins was a guest editor for the Japanese-based Literary Journal, \"Electric Rexroth\". His selection of contemporary poets and prose poets included work by Sharon Doubiago, Linda Janakos, Robert Bly, Gerald Stern, Philip Levine, Ralph Salisbury, Ingrid Wendt, Clayton Eshlemen, Marvin Bell, and Tania Pryputniewicz. Robbins' selections for \"Electric Rexroth\" were informed by a desire to present poems that contested at least two of the crucial criticisms of contemporary narrative lyrical poetry: one, that imagery had become convenient rather than fresh and emotionally driven; and two, the anecdotal self-consciousness pervading mainstream poetry had resulted in a lack of urgency in speech rhythms, while the effects of sound had become routine to the point of clich√©. The narrative idiosyncrasies, unique imagery and fantasy, idiomatic freshness, emotional and philosophical insights in Sharon Doubiago's, \"Someone waiting for me among the violins,\" Philip Levine's, \"The Simple Truth,\" Tania Pryputneiwicz's \"Labor,\" and Gerald Stern's \"Ducks Are for Our Happiness,\" are four of the fourteen selections that clearly stand as testimonials for the ongoing vitality of original expression continuing to generate out of the Whitman-W.C. Williams tradition, emphasizing poetry written in a common language close to American idiomatic speech. Two other works Robbins selected for \"Electric Rexroth\", Robert Bly's \"An Open Rose,\" and \"Grandma's Myth\" by Linda Drand (aka Linda Janakos), are, respectively, strong representations of prose poetry and the hybrid prose poem-short fiction form Robbins himself would develop in his 2004 book, \"Parking Lot Mood Swing: Autobiographical Monologues and Prose Poetry\" (Cedar Hill Press).\n\nEthnic and working-class themes are embodied in the characters and narrators in Doren Robbins' poems. Most of these characters are family members or friends Robbins worked with when he was pantry man, broiler chef, deliveryman, book store clerk, or carpenter. Whether they be family members that escaped pogroms in Ukraine, deserted the Russian Revolution, survived WWI, WWII, the American-Korean War, or contemporary veterans and immigrants that returned from the American-Vietnam War or the violent conflicts in Latin America, many of these characters are survivors of the ongoing industry of international civilized violence. The storytellers that passed on the historical experience of persecution, exploitation, rape, and murder are legendary characters in the sense that they had the will and the luck to emigrate and survive. Some of these characters appear in the poems \"Before and After Tampico\", \"Four Family\", and \"My Pico Boulevard\". The later poem literally emphasizes and politicizes the French poet Blaise Cendrars' declaration and manifesto, \"Poetry is in the Streets\" (\"Le Poesy es en la rue\"), while extending his claim to the notion that the poetry emerging from these streets is historical and demands a radical disclosure and expression regarding the ideologies of power and censorship underlying and undermining the subject. These and several other of his poems are a compassionate and bitter witnessing of injustice and attest to a realism with ethical concerns stretching back to the Jewish Prophets of the First Testament. One of his more noted poems, \"For Neruda\", his elegy to the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, commemorates the life and work of Neruda as one to be celebrated for his compassion, dissidence, and rage, not only for his remarkable love poems, or for his allegiance to Joseph Stalin.\n\nRobbins' notion of the legendary individual is not associated with archetypal patterns that are readily universal, but with archetypal characters that are autonomous in relation to the uniqueness of time, place, and culture. Furthermore, these characters are not epic or tragic heroes; they are cooks, carpenters and war veterans making enough to live month-to-month, a political exile saving money to bring the rest of his family across the U.S. border, a guy who survived a concentration camp working the delicatessen counter, waitresses and cashiers working in poor coffee shops and department stores. His poems \"Anna\", and \"Dvayda\", display the tradition of the legendary common woman linked to Chaucer's \"Wife of Bath\" with her exceptional forthrightness or Shakespeare's Emilia with her erotic honesty and her ethical, non-negotiable good will. The struggles and comradeship of the two main characters of B. Traven's \"The Death Ship\" can be seen in a parallel frame with the aforementioned poem, \"Before and After Tampico.\"\n\nFor Robbins, the Ars Poetica of \"Poetry is in the Streets\" does not erase the imaginative drive for creating complex narrative poems that modulate space and time, utilize unusual or surreal images, hyperbolic and ecstatic metaphors with the purpose in essence being to create and perform highly rhythmic lyrical-narrative poems capable of carrying a variety of the tones of emotional expression. Unlike the elegies to the renowned poets Neruda or Pavese, one of the poems that best represents Robbins' method is the elegy, \"Name a Dish After Me\", written about the early death of his brother-in-law, John Mazak, who was a cook. Here the leaps and associations from Mazak's death to his childhood, to scenes of his surviving daughters and sister, to the speaker's reflections and fantasies musically build-up to an emotionally intricate closure.\n\nRobbins has also created a substantial body of poems exploring the conflicts and celebrating the ecstasy and emotional complexity of married life, including the unique bond between parent and child. These poems are included in his earlier books \"Sympathetic Manifesto\" and \"Seduction of the Groom\". The strongest examples of earlier poems in this genre are \"In-terminal Rose\", \"Seduction of the Groom\", \"Dreaming of a Daughter\", and \"In the Middle of a Fight\". Examples from his more recent collections \"Double Muse\", \"The Donkey's Tale\" \"Driving Face Down\", and \"My Piece of the Puzzle, include \"You Have Brought So Much To This Marriage. And So Have I\", \"Marc Chagall and the Male Soul\", \"I Went Through a Box of Emily's Shell Jewelry\", \"The Eighties\"; and from current published poems: \"Pulled Over\", \"The Fire Petal\", \"The Weaving\", \"The Sexiest Part\", \"My Boat, My Waves\", and \"Badlands and Outlands\".\n\nWhile the poems listed above are products of a sensual, emotionally confrontational, and melancholic sensibility, \"Badlands and Outlands\" (\"Double Muse\" 1998) is the longest and most ambitious of his love poems. As compared to the overall compilation of his poems exploring divisions or celebrating sex and intimate companionship, \"Badlands and Outlands\" is a meditation on a divided and partially formed personality, a possibly undependable sexually charged partner who is still aware of the potential for a way out of marital commitment. The narrator observes his habits and behaviors with their sometimes self-destructive drives (self-destructive in the sense that intimate trust is damaged by lust); he faces \"not exhilaration,/ not imagery, [but] some other shore/ where celebrating stops [‚Ä¶]\" And yet, there is \"‚Ä¶the sustaining presence / of Venus Janakosov\" and, finally, his connecting attraction for her is \"crested, empathic, vulgar.\" The poem, for all of its self-destructive plunging and reflection is a commitment to marriage resonating with fertility and ambiguity: \"momentary undermined attentions, in Florence‚Äî/ the fatigue and vibrant tone,/ the sunflower's hole cragged with seeds, in Florence,/ the frame without angles, in Florence.\"\n\nMany poets confronting the limitations of lineation in poetry, while desiring a wider subject matter and freedom in the approach to style, have turned to the prose poem. In his craft statement on writing prose poetry Robbins noted, \"I do not work in formal structures, but I have worked diligently to create 'free verse' and prose poem styles that retain the dynamics of what Whitman called 'the poetic quality'[‚Ä¶]\" It is well known that Ford Maddox Ford and Ezra Pound believed poetry should be at least as well written as prose; the opposite is also true, especially in terms of sensitivity to sound, not to mention an active rhythmic phrasing flowing directly or erratically as emotional tone forces arrangements of meaning. Arguably, the collage technique of monologue, short fiction, prose poem, interior monologue, and vaudeville-influenced dialogue reflect an attraction to Chaucer's high mockery in \"House of Fame\", Bottom's dream from \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", as well Shakespeare's other \"clowns\" in \"Othello\" and particularly the \"philosophizing\" clown in \"King Lear\".\n\nRobbins' first prose collection, \"Parking Lot Mood Swing: Autobiographical Monologues and Prose Poetry\", certainly displays an affinity with Sterne's enlightened absurdities and non-liner style in \"Tristram Shandy\". His prose poem essay in \"Bear Flag Republic\" notes with appreciation the writings of Louis-Ferdinand Celine, Henry Miller, Samuel Beckett, Marguerite Young, Kurt Vonnegut Jr., Thomas Bernhard, Stephen Dixon, and Kenneth Patchen of the previously noted \"Journal of Albion Moonlight\". Such works as \"Chaucer's Quill, Sappho's Libido, Frida Kahlo's Eye Brows\", \"Dealing With the Insomnia Surf\", \"Pantagruel Antigruel\", \"As Much Sex as Elvis\", \"Green Torso\", and \"Whitman, Artaud, and the Punk Nation\", from \"Parking Lot Mood Swing\" appear to be a natural form for supporting his drive to include in a serio-comic poetic language subjects and details usually left out of poetry. Whether these \"omissions\" are implicit to the ongoing decorum of lyric poetry, or if the matter revolves around the restrictions of lineation as compared to the reality of including unlimited material expressed in rhythmic sentences, Robbins recent publications indicate he has opted for working in this genre along with his ongoing lyric-narrative output. Supporting this claim are several prose examples published after \"Parking Lot Mood Swing\", such as \"Alternate Robonovich, Adjunct\", \"Nothing but an Ear\", \"Arlon's Talking to Himself Memoir\", from the forthcoming novella, \"Twin Extra\" (Highmoonoon 2010); and \"Just My Luck\", \"My Defects Call Me Back\", and \"Night Song\" from the \"Bear Flag Republic\" prose poem anthology.\n\nPoetry\nPrize in Poetry 2001.\nPress, 1996)\nShort Fiction\n\nCriticism\nDoren Robbins has published critical essays and articles on Kenneth Rexroth, George Oppen, Phillip Levine, Deborah Eisenberg, Michael McClure, Philip Whalen, Charles Bukowski, Thomas McGrath, Larry Levis, Bob Dylan, Carol Tinker, Katerina Gogou, Ellen Bass and Kazuko Shiraishi among others in \"The Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies\", \"The Daily Iowan\", \"Third Rail\", \"Onthebus\", \"Caliban\" and others.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1855023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1855023", "title": "F. C. Burnand", "text": "F. C. Burnand\n\nSir Francis Cowley Burnand (29 November 1836 ‚Äì 21 April 1917), usually known as F. C. Burnand, was an English comic writer and prolific playwright, best known today as the librettist of Arthur Sullivan's opera \"Cox and Box\".\n\nThe son of a prosperous family, he was educated at Eton and Cambridge, and was expected to follow a conventional career in the law or in the church, but he concluded that his vocation was the theatre. From his schooldays he had written comic plays, and from 1860 until the end of the 19th century, he produced a series of more than 200 Victorian burlesques, farces, pantomimes and other stage works. His early successes included the burlesques \"Ixion, or the Man at the Wheel\" (1863) and \"The Latest Edition of Black-Eyed Susan; or, the Little Bill that Was Taken Up\" (1866). Also in 1866, he adapted the popular farce \"Box and Cox\" as a comic opera, \"Cox and Box\", with music by Sullivan. The piece became a popular favourite and was later frequently used by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company as a curtain raiser; it remains regularly performed today.\n\nBy the 1870s, Burnand was generating a prodigious output of plays as well as comic pieces and illustrations for the humour magazine \"Punch\". Among his 55-stage works during the decade was another frequently revived hit, \"Betsy\" (1879). For \"Punch\", among other things, he wrote the popular column \"Happy Thoughts\", in which the narrator recorded the difficulties and distractions of everyday life. Also admired were his burlesques of other writers' works. Burnand was a contributor to \"Punch\" for 45 years and its editor from 1880 until 1906 and is credited with adding much to the popularity and prosperity of the magazine. His editorship of the original publication of \"The Diary of a Nobody\" by the brothers George and Weedon Grossmith was a high point of his tenure in 1888‚Äì89. Many of his articles were collected and published in book form. His stage successes in the 1890s included his English-language versions of two Edmond Audran operettas, titled \"La Cigale\" and \"Miss Decima\" (both in 1891). His last works included collaborations on pantomimes of \"Cinderella\" (1905) and \"Aladdin\" (1909).\n\nKnown generally for his genial wit and good humor, Burnand was nevertheless intensely envious of his contemporary W. S. Gilbert but was unable to emulate his rival's success as a comic opera librettist. In other forms of theatre Burnand was outstandingly successful, with his works receiving London runs of up to 550 performances and extensive tours in the British provinces and the US. He published several humorous books and memoirs and was knighted in 1902 for his work on \"Punch\".\n\nBurnand was born in central London, the only child of Francis Burnand and his first wife Emma, \"n√©e\" Cowley, who died when her son was eight days old. Burnand senior, a stockbroker, was descended from an old Savoyard family, prominent in the silk trade; his wife was a descendant of the poet and dramatist Hannah Cowley.\n\nBurnand was educated at Eton, where, aged fifteen, he wrote a farce, \"Guy Fawkes Day\", played at Cookesley's house, and subsequently at the Theatre Royal, Worthing. While at Eton, he submitted some illustrations to the comic weekly magazine, \"Punch\", one or two of which were published. In 1854 he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where as an undergraduate he sought the approval of the Vice-Chancellor, Edwin Guest, of the establishment of a Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club, with a performance of \"Box and Cox\". Guest and his colleagues refused their consent, but Burnand went ahead without it. The members of the club performed a triple bill under stage names to avoid retribution from the university. The club prospered (and continues to the present day); Burnand acted and wrote plays under the name Tom Pierce.\n\nBurnand graduated in 1858. His family had expected that he would study for the bar, but the Burnands held the right to appoint the incumbent of a Church of England parish that became vacant, and it was agreed that he should train for the priesthood. He enrolled at Cuddesdon theological college, where his studies of divinity led him to leave the Anglican church and become a Roman Catholic. This caused a breach between Burnand and his father, but the estrangement did not last long. To the disappointment of Cardinal Manning, leader of the English Catholics, Burnand announced that his vocation was not for the church but for the theatre. Father and son were reconciled, and Burnand returned to his original plan of reading for the bar at Lincoln's Inn.\n\nIn February 1860 Burnand had his first piece performed in the West End, \"Dido the Celebrated Widow\", a musical burlesque of \"Dido and Aeneas\", played at the St James's Theatre. The following month he married an actress, Cecilia Victoria Ranoe (1841‚Äì1870), daughter of James Ranoe, a clerk; the couple had five sons and two daughters. He was called to the bar in 1862, and practised for a short time, but his main interest was in writing. In the early 1860s, he edited the short-lived journal \"The Glow-Worm\" and then joined the staff of \"Fun\", edited by H. J. Byron. He parted company with Byron when the magazine rejected his proposed 1863 literary burlesque of a Reynolds serial, entitled \"Mokeanna, or the White Witness\". He showed his manuscript to Mark Lemon, editor of \"Punch\", who accepted it for publication; Burnand remained a \"Punch\" writer for the rest of his career.\n\n\"Dido\" was followed by \"The √éles of St Tropez\" (1860), \"Fair Rosamond\" (1862) and \"The Deal Boatman\" (1863), among many others. His most memorable early success was another musical burlesque, \"Ixion, or the Man at the Wheel\" (1863), starring Lydia Thompson in the title role, which found audiences on both sides of the Atlantic. By this time Burnand was a skilled negotiator with theatre managements, and he was among the first authors to insist on profit-sharing instead of fixed royalties. For \"Ixion\" this brought him a total of around ¬£3,000. Other notable early works included an op√©ra bouffe, \"Windsor Castle\" (1865), with music by Frank Musgrave, and more pun-filled burlesques, including \"Helen, or, Taken from the Greek\", and \"Guy Fawkes, or The Ugly Mug and the Couple of Spoons\", both in 1866. Later in 1866 Burnand had a huge success with the burlesque \"The Latest Edition of Black-Eyed Susan; or, the Little Bill that Was Taken Up\", parodying the three-act melodrama by Douglas Jerrold, \"Black-Eyed Susan\"; the show ran for 400 nights at the Royalty Theatre, was played for years provincially and in the US, and was twice revived in London.\nIn 1866, Burnand adapted the popular farce \"Box and Cox\" as a comic opera, \"Cox and Box\", with music by the young composer Arthur Sullivan. The piece was written for a private performance but was repeated and given its first public performance at the Adelphi Theatre in 1867. The reviewer for \"Fun\" was W. S. Gilbert, who wrote\n\n\"Cox and Box\" became a popular favourite and was frequently revived. It was the only work not by Gilbert in the regular repertory of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company during the 20th century and is the only work of Burnand's still frequently staged. Its success encouraged its authors to write the two-act opera, \"The Contrabandista\" (1867), revised and expanded as \"The Chieftain\" (1894), but it did not achieve much popularity in either version.\n\nMore burlesques followed in 1868, including \"Fowl Play, or, A Story of Chicken Hazard\" and \"The Rise and Fall of Richard III, or, A New Front to an Old Dicky\". In 1869, Burnand wrote \"The Turn of the Tide\", which was a success at the Queen's Theatre, and six other stage works during the course of the year.\n\nBurnand's wife Cecilia died in 1870 at age 28, leaving him with seven small children. In 1874 Burnand married her widowed sister, Rosina (d. 1924), who was also an actress. It was at that time illegal in England for a man to marry his dead wife's sister, although such marriages made outside British jurisdiction were recognised as valid; accordingly the wedding ceremony was performed in continental Europe. There were two sons and four daughters of this marriage.\n\nThroughout the 1870s, Burnand maintained a prodigious output. For the stage he wrote 55 pieces, ranging from burlesques to pantomimes, farces and extravaganzas. He was the sole author of most of them, but worked on a few with Thomas German Reed, J. L. Molloy, Henry Pottinger Stephens and even with H. J. Byron. His stage pieces of the 1870s included \"Poll and Partner Joe\" (1871), \"Penelope Anne\" (1871; a sequel to \"Cox and Box\"), \"The Miller and His Man\" (1873; \"a Christmas drawing room extravaganza\" with songs by Sullivan), \"Artful Cards\" (1877), \"Proof\" (1878), \"Dora and Diplunacy\" (1878, a burlesque of Clement Scott's \"Diplomacy\", an adaptation of Sardou's \"Dora\"), \"The Forty Thieves\" (1878; a charity collaboration among four playwrights, including Byron and Gilbert), \"Our Club\" (1878) and another frequently revived hit, \"Betsy\" (1879). He provided a burlesque of \"Robbing Roy\" to the Gaiety Theatre in 1979. Burnand's prolific writing came at some cost in quality. A biographer wrote that he \"was a facile and slapdash writer. False rhymes and awkward rhythms occur frequently in his verse, and his favourite devices included puns, topical references and slang.\"\n\nBurnand also translated or adapted for the London stage several French operettas by Offenbach, Edmond Audran, Charles Lecocq and Robert Planquette. At the same time as his busy theatrical career, he was a member of the staff of \"Punch\" under Lemon and his successors, Shirley Brooks and Tom Taylor, writing a regular stream of genial articles. His best-known work for the magazine was the column \"Happy Thoughts\", in which the narrator recorded the difficulties and distractions of everyday life. A. A. Milne considered it \"one of the most popular series which has ever appeared in \"Punch\"\"; alongside it, he rated as Burnand's best comic contributions his burlesques of other writers, such as \"The New History of Sandford and Merton\" (1872) and \"Strapmore\" by \"Weeder\" (1878).\n\nThe third editor of \"Punch\", Tom Taylor, died in July 1880; the proprietors of the magazine appointed Burnand to succeed him. In Milne's view the magazine's reputation increased considerably under Burnand:\n\nA later biographer, Jane Stedman, writes, \"His predecessor, Tom Taylor, had allowed the paper to become heavy, but Burnand's rackety leadership brightened it.\" Burnand, who declared himself \"hostile to no man's religion\", banned \"Punch\"'s previous anti-Catholicism, although he was unable to prevent some antisemitic jokes.\n\nOne of Burnand's biggest successes, both in \"Punch\" and on stage, was satire of the aesthetic movement. His play \"The Colonel\" (1881), based on \"The Serious Family\", a play by Morris Barnett, ran for 550 performances and toured extensively. It made so much money for the actor-manager Edgar Bruce that he was able to build the Prince of Wales Theatre. Burnand rushed \"The Colonel\" into production to make sure that it opened several months before Gilbert and Sullivan's similarly themed comic opera, \"Patience\", but \"Patience\" ran even longer than \"The Colonel\". Oscar Wilde, no fan of Burnand's farces, wrote, in anticipation of seeing \"Patience\": \"With Gilbert and Sullivan I am sure we will have something better than the dull farce of \"The Colonel\"\". For the Gaiety Theatre, Burnand wrote a burlesque of \"The Tempest\" entitled \"Ariel\" in October 1883, with music by Meyer Lutz, starring Nellie Farren and Arthur Williams. \"The Times\" complained of the \"flatness and insipidity\" of Burnand's text and of his vulgarising the original. \"The Observer\" was less censorious, finding the piece moderately amusing, and correctly predicting that it would run successfully until it had to make way for the annual Gaiety pantomime at Christmas.\n\nIn 1884, Burnand wrote \"Paw Claudian\", a burlesque of the 1883 costume (Byzantine) drama \"Claudian\" by Henry Herman and W. G. Wills, presented at Toole's Theatre starring J. L. Toole. The same year, he wrote a burlesque of \"Black-Eyed Susan\", called \"Black Eyed See-Usan\", for the Alhambra Theatre. Burnand wrote several musical works around 1889 and 1890 with the composer Edward Solomon, including \"Pickwick\", which was revived in 1894. \"Pickwick\" was recorded by Retrospect Opera in 2016, together with George Grossmith's \"Cups and Saucers\". Other stage pieces included adaptations for Augustine Daly in New York.\n\nIn 1890, Burnand wrote \"Captain Ther√®se,\" followed later that year by a very successful English version of Audran's operetta, \"La cigale et la fourmi\" (the grasshopper and the ant) retitled \"La Cigale\", with additional music by Ivan Caryll. In 1891, he produced an English adaptation of Audran's \"Miss Helyett\", retitled as \"Miss Decima\". Burnand's \"The Saucy Sally\" premiered in 1892, and \"Mrs Ponderbury's Past\" played in 1895. Burnand's 1897 comic opera, \"His Majesty\", with music by Alexander Mackenzie, failed despite the contributions of the lyricist Adrian Ross and a Savoy Theatre cast including Ilka P√°lmay, George Grossmith and Walter Passmore. The blame was generally held to be Burnand's. \"The Times\" commented, \"Mr Burnand's experience as a librettist of comic opera, and Sir Alexander Mackenzie's inexperience in this class of composition might lead the public to expect a brilliant book weighed down by music of too serious and ambitious a type. The exact opposite is the case.\" Burnand's libretto was judged dull and confused, but Mackenzie's music was \"marked by distinction as well as humour.\" Stedman comments that Burnand's conviction that he, not Gilbert, should have been Sullivan's main collaborator defied the facts: \"The Chieftain\", his rewrite of \"The Contrabandista\" with Sullivan, ran for only 97 performances in 1894, and \"His Majesty\" managed only 61 performances. Nevertheless, Burnand used his position as editor of \"Punch\" to print antagonistic reviews of the plays of Gilbert and refused to give the Gilbert and Sullivan operas reviews in the magazine.\n\nBurnand's last stage works were a collaboration with J. Hickory Wood, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1905, on a pantomime of \"Cinderella\", and he was partly responsible for a pantomime of \"Aladdin\" for the same theatre in 1909. His later contributions to \"Punch\" became increasingly wordy and anecdotal, relying on far-fetched puns, but he was a good judge of talent, and under him the paper prospered. Stedman rates as a high point of his editorship the publication of \"The Diary of a Nobody\" by the brothers George and Weedon Grossmith, which was soon turned into book form and has never been out of print. He was reluctant to retire, but was persuaded to do so in 1906, and was succeeded by Owen Seaman. In 1908, Burnand became the editor of \"The Catholic Who's Who\", published by Burns & Oates.\n\nBurnand lived for much of his life in Ramsgate, Kent, on the south coast of England and was a member of the Garrick Club in London. He had a very large circle of friends and colleagues who included William Makepeace Thackeray, Mark Lemon and most writers, dramatists and actors of the day. George Grossmith wrote:\nAfter a winter of bronchitis, Burnand died in 1917 at his home in Ramsgate, at the age of 80. He was buried in the cemetery at St Augustine's Abbey church in Ramsgate.\n\nBurnand's best-known book, \"Happy Thoughts\", was originally published in \"Punch\" in 1863‚Äì64 and frequently reprinted. This was followed by \"My Time and What I've Done with It\" (1874); \"Personal Reminiscences of the A.D.C., Cambridge,\" (1880); \"The Incomplete Angler\" (1887); \"Very Much Abroad\" (1890); \"Rather at Sea\" (1890); \"Quite at Home\" (1890); \"The Real Adventures of Robinson Crusoe\" (1893); and \"Records and Reminiscences,\" in 1904.\n\n\n\n"}

Genre fiction, or popular fiction, is written to appeal to a large audience and it sells more primarily because it is more commercialised. An example is the \"Twilight\" series which may sell more than Herman Melville's \"Moby Dick\", because the \"Twilight\" novels deal with elements of pop culture ‚Äì romance and vampires.\n\nLiterary fiction is fictional works that hold literary merit, that is to say, they are works that offer social commentary, or political criticism, or focus on aspect of the human condition.\n\nLiterary fiction is usually contrasted with, popular, commercial, or genre fiction. Some have described the difference between them in terms of analysing reality (literary) rather than escaping reality (popular). The contrast between these two categories of fiction is controversial among some critics and scholars.\n\nCharacterization is one of the five elements of fiction, along with plot, setting, theme, and writing style. A character is a participant in the story, and is usually a person, but may be any persona, identity, or entity whose existence originates from a fictional work or performance.\n\nCharacters may be of several types:\n\nThe plot, or storyline, is the rendering and ordering of the events and actions of a story. Starting with the initiating event, then the rising action, conflict, climax, falling action, and ending possibly with a resolution.\n\nPlot consists of action and reaction, also referred to as stimulus and response and has a beginning, a middle, and an ending.\n\nThe climax of the novel consists of a single action-packed sentence in which the conflict (problem) of the novel is resolved. This sentence comes towards the end of the novel. The main part of the action should come before the climax.\n\nPlot also has a mid-level structure: scene and sequel. A scene is a unit of drama‚Äîwhere the action occurs. Then, after a transition of some sort, comes the sequel‚Äîan emotional reaction and regrouping, an aftermath.\n\nSetting is the locale and time of a story. The setting is often a real place, but may be a fictitious city or country within our own world; a different planet; or an alternate universe, which may or may not have similarities with our own universe. Sometimes setting is referred to as milieu, to include a context (such as society) beyond the immediate surroundings of the story. It is basically where and when the story takes place.\n\nTheme is what the author is trying to tell the reader. For example, the belief in the ultimate good in people, or that things are not always what they seem. This is often referred to as the \"moral of the story.\" Some fiction contains advanced themes like morality, or the value of life, whereas other stories have no theme, or a very shallow one.\n\nStyle includes the multitude of choices fiction writers make, consciously or not, in the process of writing a story. It encompasses not only the big-picture, strategic choices such as point of view and choice of narrator, but also tactical choices of grammar, punctuation, word usage, sentence and paragraph length and structure, tone, the use of imagery, chapter selection, titles, etc. In the process of creating a story, these choices meld to become the writer's voice, his or her own unique style.\n\nFor each piece of fiction, the author makes many choices, consciously or subconsciously, which combine to form the writer's unique style. The components of style are numerous, but include point of view, choice of narrator, fiction-writing mode, person and tense, grammar, punctuation, word usage, sentence length and structure, paragraph length and structure, tone, imagery, chapter usage, and title selection.\n\nThe narrator is the story teller. The main character in the book can also be the narrator.\n\nPoint of view is the perspective (or type of personal or non-personal \"lens\") through which a story is communicated. Narrative point of view or narrative perspective describes the position of the narrator, that is, the character of the storyteller, in relation to the story being told.\n\nThe tone of a literary work expresses the writer's attitude toward or feelings about the subject matter and audience.\n\nSuspension of disbelief is the reader's temporary acceptance of story elements as believable, regardless of how implausible they may seem in real life.\n\nErnest Hemingway wrote \"Prose is architecture, not interior decoration.\"\n\nStephen King, in his non-fiction, part autobiographical, part self-help writing memoir, \"\", he gives readers helpful advice on honing their craft: \"Description begins in the writer's imagination, but should finish in the reader's.\"\n\nKurt Vonnegut the author of praised novels \"Cat's Cradle\", \"Slaughterhouse-Five\", and \"Breakfast of Champions\", has given his readers, from his short story collection, \"Bagombo Snuff Box\", eight rules on how to write a successful story. The list can be found in the Introduction of the collection.\n\n\"Now lend me your ears. Here is Creative Writing 101:\n\n\n\n"}

At least some of his works were painted in 304 BC. No tradition of Roman painting exists earlier than the time of Fabius, nor does his example appear to have been followed by any of his contemporaries; for an interval of nearly a hundred and fifty years occurs before any mention is made of another Roman painter.\n\nFabius, called Pictor, a Roman artist, descended from the celebrated family of the Fabii, painted principally at Rome. Pictor was the grandfather of the Roman historian Quintus Fabius Pictor. In 304 BC, Pictor decorated the Temple of Salus on the Quirinal Hill, with a representation (presumably) of the battle gained by Bubulus over the Samnites. His paintings were preserved until the reign of the Emperor Gaius, when the temple was destroyed by fire. They were probably held in little estimation, as Pliny, to whom they must have been known, neither acquaints us with the subjects, nor commends the execution.\n\nThe art of painting in its rude and early forms was general in Italy, but was founded on the Etruscan style, which never advanced beyond a flat polychromatic treatment. In regards to the fine arts, Rome owes all to Greece, but in painting never acquired the individuality in which it did in the other arts. Painting was then little respected by the Romans, and that the title of \"Pictor\" was not considered as an honourable distinction, but rather intended to stigmatize the illustrious character who had degraded his dignity by the practice of an art which was held in no consideration, may be inferred from a passage of Cicero, in the first book of his \"Tusculan Disputations\": \"An censemus si Fabio nobilissimo homini laudatum esset quod pingeret, non multos etiam apud nos Polycletos et Parrhasios fuisse.\"\n\n\nAttribution:\n"}

They are scattered throughout the posterior inferior temporal cortex in an area called the V4 complex. They are clustered by color preference, and organized as color columns. They are the first part of the brain in which color is processed in terms of the full range of hues found in color space.\n\nThe term \"glob\" was proposed by Bevil Conway and Doris Tsao on an analogy with the cytochrome-oxidase\nblobs of V1, an earlier stage in the hierarchical elaboration of color. This also distinguishes them from other types of modules found elsewhere in the cerebral cortex such as face patches, and inferior\ntemporal feature columns.\n\nGlobs are found in the V4 complex, an area in the inferior temporal cortex, forward of area V3, that includes areas V4, the dorsal part of the posterior inferior temporal cortex and the rear part of the inferior temporal near the occipital lobe called TEO. Their neurons are not restricted to a single color preference. Neurons in adjacent glob cells have similar color tuning and form clusters that are arranged spatially within the cortex. In between them are ‚Äò‚Äòinterglob‚Äô‚Äô areas that were not color sensitive but respond to shape. \n\nThe color-tuned neurons are arranged in color columns that are of a finer scale than single globs. These columns are between 50 and 100 Œºm in size. Color preferences of neurons recorded sequentially along given columns are arranged according to a chromotopic map that reflects perceptual color space. \n\nThey are studied using functional MRI and single-unit recording.\n\nThree types of retinal cone create signals that get transformed in the visual pathway to create the perception of color. However the neurons processing them in the retina, lateral geniculate nucleus, and V1 and V2 early parts of the visual cortex encode using the opponent process only a limited range of colors that does not reflect the dimensions of perceptual color space. It is only the next area where globs are found that along the visual processing hierarchy, show hue sensitivity, with the population of\nneurons representing most (if not all) of perceptual color space and which the color\nresponses of neurons correspond to perception.\n"}

Its release in West Germany was followed by international releases to many European countries, the British Commonwealth and the United States. It became one of the greatest box-office successes of West German cinema, viewed by forty million people in West Germany and internationally. In the first months of its showing in West Germany the audience had reached four million people. The film featured scenes of childbirth which were the first to be shown publicly in Germany. \"Helga\" was the first in a series of educational films which were considered \"relatively permissive\" at the time. The film was considered a part of an \"enlightenment wave\" which was undertaken by the West German Federal government at the time. In 1968, in France, the film was viewed by five million people. In Grenoble alone it is reported that 60,000 viewers had seen it in the first days of its screening, out of a population of 150,000. In Tours, the film played to full-houses for three consecutive weeks. The film used animation, stock footage and microphotography to depict the stages of life from conception to childbirth. \n\nThe film was produced between 1966-1967 by Rinco-Film in Munich for the West German Federal Ministry of Health under health minister K√§te Str√∂bel through the German Health Museum. It documents the pregnancy of a young woman from the first visit to the doctor all the way to childbirth. Upon its release, it was classified as a documentary by the West German film classification board SPIO.\n\nThe film has been studied due to its impact on German society involving the sociopolitical implications of the intervention by the West German federal government in matters of sexual education involving the mass media as well as the curriculum they approved regarding sexual matters. The West German federal government used the film as an educational tool but also as a means to gain influence in areas such as public health and education which were traditionally under regional jurisdiction, possibly even bypassing constitutional issues governing the distribution of powers between the Federal government and the regions. Up to that time, regional authorities could veto Federal policies which were seen by them as encroaching on their cultural policies. \n\nThe success of the film when viewed by an audience of a wide and diverse demographic was analysed in terms of its influence on social thinking. Gender issues related to the film have been considered due to the fact that matters traditionally concerning privacy, intimacy and femininity, up to that point in time, were made public to a wide demographic through film and the mass media. The commercial success of the film has also been examined since it was a sex-education film without any famous actors or an elaborate plot. The film was successful in countries such as France, Italy and England which were considered \"prudish\" at the time. In Paris, 1,500 catholic priests and nuns attended a private screening of the film arranged by \"centrale catholique\". The film was also extensively covered by print media such as \"Elle\" and \"Paris Match\".\n\nThe film was a product of a political decision by the West German Federal government to educate the people regarding matters related to procreation and family planning at a time of advances in the fields of human genetics and contraception. The film gained acceptance in the young adult demographic due to their desire to be informed about issues related to family planning and childbirth as part of a consumer society in which women had to work. Educators, although worried about the impact of the violence of the scenes during childbirth upon the young, also accepted that the film could aid the understanding of husbands concerning the great pains experienced by their wives during childbirth. The film also presented a new model of informed motherhood based on knowledge and social awareness.\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews, with the conservative press leading the way. \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\" described the film as \"enlightening in a comprehensive and rational manner, without hypocrisy and false shame\". The critic added: \n\nThe conservative \"Mindener Tageblatt\" commented that \"the really scientific information had been conveyed in a flawlessly proper manner without prudery and without arousing inappropriate sexual feelings\".\n\nThe left-liberal press was more critical of the film. The \"S√ºddeutsche Zeitung\" critic remarked that: \n\nThe press which was present at the sneak preview also criticised the film's \"ridiculous frame action\", \"heavy didactic tone\" and \"lack of contraceptive information\". Women correspondents also complained that Helga in \"her perfect makeup\" during childbirth \"did not adequately depict the pain of the anonymous woman in labour\".\n\nOther audience reactions included those of some teenage girls which were shocked by the placenta removal scenes and the subsequent revelations that the placenta was used for the production of cosmetics. The perspective and appearance of medical instruments was also criticised as reminiscent of a horror film.\n\nThe \"Protestant Film Observer\" criticised the presentation aspects of the film and the absence of information on family planning, birth control and abortion.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13869411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13869411", "title": "John Hollingshead", "text": "John Hollingshead\n\nJohn Hollingshead (9 September 1827 ‚Äì 9 October 1904) was an English theatrical impresario, journalist and writer during the latter half of the 19th century. After a journalism career, Hollingshead managed the Alhambra Theatre and was later the first manager of the Gaiety Theatre, London. Hollingshead also wrote several books during his life.\n\nAn innovative producer, Hollingshead brought Gilbert and Sullivan together in 1871 to produce their first joint work, a musical extravaganza called \"Thespis\". Among other theatrical works that he produced, he mounted a long series of popular Victorian burlesques at the Gaiety, engaging Meyer Lutz to compose original scores for them. He also produced operettas, plays and other works. These productions made stars of Nellie Farren and several others. At the Gaiety, in 1878, Hollingshead was the first theatre manager to light his auditorium with electric lights.\n\nHollingshead was born in Hoxton, Greater London, the son of Henry Randall Hollingshead. He was educated at Homerton. He first worked as a bookkeeper for a soft goods company in London in the early 1850s while publishing political essays on finance and social reform. He soon entered into a partnership as a clothing merchant. During this time, Hollingshead and his friend Moy Thomas began publishing a penny paper called \"The Mail\" that proved unsuccessful. In 1854, he decided to close his clothing business and begin working as a writer full-time. By 1855, Hollingshead was married with two children. He died in London at the age of 77.\n\nHollingshead started his journalism career in 1854 under the tutelage of Charles Dickens at \"Household Words\" magazine and then under W. M. Thackeray at \"Cornhill Magazine\". In 1861, he acted as the \"special correspondent\" for \"The Morning Post\" during the London famine. He also wrote essays, short stories and dramatic criticism. Beginning in 1864, and for several years thereafter, he contributed to \"Punch magazine\", mostly writing on political topics related to social reform. He advocated the principles of Mill and Jeremy Bentham. One of his best-known essays was an 1857 piece called \"The City of Unlimited Paper\", which became famous during the monetary panic of 1857. In the 1860s he was on the staff of \"Good Words\" under Norman Macleod as editor.\n\nHollingshead wrote a number of books from the 1850s into the 1860s, including \"On the canal: a narrative of a voyage from London to Birmingham\" (1858); \"Under Bow Bells\" (1860, a collection of some of his essays), \"Rubbing the Gilt Off\" (a collection of his early political essays (1860) \"Odd Journeys\" (1860, a collection of travels), \"Ways of Life\" (1861, a volume of humorous papers), \"Ragged London\" (1861, a collection of his reports for the \"Morning Post\"), and \"Underground London\" (1862). Other publications included a collection of humorous stories entitled \"Rough Diamonds\" and two volumes of miscellaneous essays called \"Today\". He also wrote plays.\nIn the 1880s, Hollingshead returned to writing, producing books mostly about the theatre, including \"Plain English\" (1880), and \"Footlights\" (1883). Beginning in the 1890s, he wrote a number of memoirs and more books about the theatres that he had managed. In 1892, he also published \"The Story of Leicester Square\", tracing the history, geography and architecture of the London neighbourhood from earliest times through the date of publication. His memoir entitled \"My Lifetime\", published in 1895, explores his life and career through that date.\n\nIn the 1860s, Hollingshead turned to theatre management. He helped establish the Alhambra Theatre and was the stage manager there from 1865 to 1868, in addition to producing musical pieces and ballets there. He made it famous for its sumptuous staging, alluring corps de ballet and the notorious front-of-house Promenade bar, where the young ladies of the ballet hinted at more than terpsichorean pleasure.\nDuring his tenure at the Alhambra, Hollingshead introduced London audiences to the Can-Can. Hollingshead is also credited with inventing the practice of holding general matin√©es. Hollingshead was one of the first London theatre managers to eliminate fees for programmes and coat check.\n\nHe left the Alhambra to manage the newly redesigned Gaiety Theatre. In addition, Hollingshead managed shows at the Opera Comique from time to time. He produced a revival of Gilbert's \"Princess Toto\" there in 1881, paired with Rutland Barrington's short play, \"Quid Pro Quo\".\n\nIn 1868, Hollingshead took over the Gaiety Theatre, which had been a large music hall. The auditorium was rebuilt and, under Hollingshead, it became a venue primarily for musical burlesque, variety, continental operetta, including several operettas by Jacques Offenbach, and light comedy, under Hollingshead's management, from 1868 to 1886. The theatre opened on 21 December 1868, with the successful \"Robert the Devil\", by W. S. Gilbert, a burlesque of the opera \"Robert le Diable\". Gilbert also wrote \"An Old Score\" for the theatre in 1869. Another early production was Alfred Thompson's \"Columbus!, or the Original Pitch in a Merry Key\" (1869). Nellie Farren starred in both \"Columbus\" and \"Robert the Devil\". She continued as \"Principal Boy\" at the Gaiety for the next 25 years, first under Hollingshead and then under George Edwardes. Other Gaiety stalwarts were Edward Terry, Kate Vaughan and Fred Leslie. The theatre's music director, Meyer Lutz, composed or arranged the music for many of its most successful burlesques.\nIn 1870, Henry James Byron's \"Uncle Dick's Darling\" starred a young Henry Irving. This was the last play that theatre buff Charles Dickens saw before his death. Other pieces at Hollingshead's Gaiety in 1870 included \"Dot\" (Dion Boucicault's version of \"The Cricket on the Hearth\"); and \"The Princess of Trebizonde\", based on the Jacques Offenbach operetta (1870). \"Thespis\", the first collaboration between Gilbert and Sullivan, played at the theatre in 1871, with Farren as Mercury and J. L. Toole in the title role. Offenbach's \"Les deux aveugles\" played in 1872, starring Fred Sullivan. This was followed by such works as \"Shilly-Shally\" (1872) by Anthony Trollope and Charles Reade; \"Antony and Cleopatra\" (1873); and \"The Battle of Life\", (based on Charles Dickens's Christmas story of that title). Two other Dion Boucicault plays produced by Hollingshead's company in the early 1870s were \"Night and Morning\" and \"Led Astray\". Boucicault's \"Don Caesar de Bazan\" was travestied in Byron's \"Little Don Caesar de Bazan\".\nIn the late 1870s, the theatre became the first to install electric lighting on its auditorium. Hollingshead's productions there included \"The Bohemian G-yurl and the Unapproachable Pole\" (1877), Byron's farce \"Little Doctor Faust\" (1878) Byron's \"Handsome Hernani, or The Fatal Penny-Whistle\" (1879); and \"Robbing Roy\" (1879). Meyer Lutz's \"Ali Baba and The Forty Thieves\" was performed in 1880 (Hollingshead had produced a highly successful charity production called \"The Forty Thieves\" at the Gaiety in 1878), and a burlesque of \"Aladdin\", by Robert Reece, in 1881. These were followed by \"Little Robin Hood\" (1882), a burlesque by Reece, \"Blue Beard\" (1882), \"Ariel\" (1883, by F. C. Burnand, based on \"The Tempest\"), \"Don Yuan\", Byron's \"Little Don Caesar de Bazan\" (a send-up of Boucicault's play), \"Mazeppa\" (1884), \"Little Jack Sheppard\" (1885), \"Monte Cristo Jr.\" (1886), and dozens of others. John D'Auban choreographed the Gaiety burlesques from 1868. In addition to these burlesques, the theatre produced comedies such as Congreve's \"Love for Love\", Vanbrugh's \"Relapse\", \"The Grasshopper\" (1877, an adaptation by Hollingshead of Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Hal√©vy's \"La Cigale\"), and a number of farces.\n\nNevertheless, burlesque and risque operettas were the normal fare at the Gaiety. Hollingshead called himself a \"licensed dealer in legs, short skirts, French adaptations, Shakespeare, taste and musical glasses.\" In 1886, George Edwards took over the lease to the Gaiety.\n\n\n"}

The building was modeled after the Concertgebouw concert hall in Amsterdam, and it was inaugurated on 31 October 1894 with a performance by the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Australian opera singer Nellie Melba as the featured soloist. Beginning 1904, it was also used for touring performances by the Metropolitan Opera, and from 1950, it was the home of the Baltimore Opera Company until the company's liquidation in 2009.\n\nThe Lyric has been the home of the Lyric Opera Baltimore company since 2011. It was founded after the demise of Baltimore Lyric Opera.\n\nPrior to the 1909 purchase of the building on behalf of the Metropolitan Opera by Otto Kahn, Oscar Hammerstein I presented an opera season and began to make plans to remodel it by enlarging the stage area. However Kahn's purchase caused the venue's name to be changed to the Lyric Theatre. and firmed up the continuity of the Metropolitan Opera's annual visits. In the early 20th century, the Lyric Opera featured opera tenor Enrico Caruso who appeared there with the Metropolitan Opera in a performance of Flotow's \"Martha\".\n\nIn 1950, building on earlier amateur efforts, the Baltimore Opera was formally established as the Baltimore Civic Opera Company, with the famous American soprano Rosa Ponselle as its first artistic director. She brought Beverly Sills to Baltimore for a production of \"Manon\" in 1952. By 1970, the name was changed to Baltimore Opera Company and had become firmly established at the Lyric.\n\nHaving been modeled on the Concertgebouw, the Lyric was primarily used as a concert hall. 1916 saw the founding of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra which presented performances there until 1982, while the building was purchased from Kahn in 1920 and a significant renovation created an enlarged balcony with seating capacity reaching 2,800. In March 1974, the Lyric's 75th anniversary featured the return of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and throughout these years, the Philadelphia Orchestra made regular appearances in Baltimore until April 1980. A highlight was the 1934 premiere of Rachmaninoff's \"Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini\", with the composer at the piano.\n\nMany different kinds of events were presented at the Lyric, including sporting events such as the 1905 lightweight boxing fight between Joe Gans, the lightweight champion, and Mike Sullivan and the 1906 wrestling bout between Gus Schoenlein and the world champion, George Hackenschmidt, the world champion of the time. The first public showing of electric cooking in Baltimore took place, as well as hosting speakers like Aimee Semple McPherson, Will Rogers, Richard Byrd, Clarence Darrow, Amelia Earhart, Charles Lindbergh and William Jennings Bryan.\n\nPerformers appearing at the Lyric included in April/May 1984 Yul Brynner who starred in \"The King and I\" which over 70,000 people attended in four weeks. That same year, Patti Labelle's performances sold out five performances while, in 1987, \"Cats\" played to over 75,000 people.\n\nMajor renovations from 1980-1982 completed its transformation into an opera house. \n"}
{"id": "1480754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1480754", "title": "My Dinner with Andre", "text": "My Dinner with Andre\n\nMy Dinner with Andre is a 1981 American comedy-drama film directed by Louis Malle, and written by and starring Andre Gregory (Andre) and Wallace Shawn (Wally). The actors play fictionalized versions of themselves sharing a conversation at Caf√© des Artistes in Manhattan. The film's dialogue covers such things as experimental theatre, the nature of theatre, and the nature of life, and contrasts Wally's modest humanism with Andre's spiritual experiences.\n\nAndre Gregory is the focus of the first hour of the film, when he describes some of his experiences since giving up his career as a theatre director in 1975. These include working with his friend, director Jerzy Grotowski, and a group of Polish actors in a forest in Poland, his visit to Findhorn in Scotland, and his trip to the Sahara to try to create a play based on \"The Little Prince\" by St.-Exup√©ry. He worked with a group in a small piece of performance art on Long Island, which resulted in Andre's being (briefly) buried alive on Halloween night.\n\nThe rest of the film is a conversation as Wally Shawn tries to argue that living life as Andre has done for the past five years is simply not possible for most people. He relates ordinary pleasures, like having a cup of coffee. Andre responds that what passes for normal life in New York in the late 1970s, is more akin to living in a dream than it is to real life. The movie ends without a clear resolution to the conflict in worldviews articulated by the two men. Wally reminisces during a taxi ride about his childhood and mentions that when he arrives at home, he tells his girlfriend Debbie about his dinner with Andre. Erik Satie's \"Gymnop√©die No. 1\" plays in the background.\n\n\nThe idea for the film arose from Gregory's effort to work with a biographer on his life story, and Shawn's simultaneously coming up with an idea for a story about two people having a conversation. Gregory and Shawn, who had become friends through theatre work, decided to collaborate on the project. They agreed that it should be filmed rather than produced as a play. Although the film was based on events in the actors' lives, Shawn and Gregory denied (in an interview by film critic Roger Ebert) that they were playing themselves. They said that if they remade the film, they would swap the two characters to prove their point. In an interview with Noah Baumbach in 2009, Shawn said, \n\nI actually had a purpose as I was writing this: I wanted to destroy that guy that I played, to the extent that there was any of \"me\" there. I wanted to kill that side of myself by making the film, because that guy is totally motivated by fear.\n\nThe screenplay went through numerous developmental changes in location; in the final version, it was set during a dinner at a restaurant. While Shawn was trying to find someone to direct the film, he received a phone call from French director Louis Malle. He had read a copy of the screenplay via a mutual friend and insisted that he work on the project, saying he wanted to direct, produce the film, or work on it in any capacity. Shawn initially thought that the call was a prank, due to Malle's stature in film. Malle later suggested that the dinner setup would not work, based on a rehearsal where Gregory was talking while eating. Shawn argued throughout screenplay development for more scenes, which would have resulted in a three-hour film. Malle won many script cuts, but lost two arguments over scenes that were kept in the film.\n\n\"My Dinner with Andre\" was filmed in the Jefferson Hotel, which was then vacant, in Richmond, Virginia. (The hotel has since been restored and reopened as a luxury venue.) Lloyd Kaufman was the production manager on the film, and Troma Entertainment provided production support. The filming was done over a period of two weeks, and edited to appear as if occurring in real time. The set was created to look like the iconic Caf√© des Artistes in New York City.\n\nRoger Ebert and Gene Siskel gave high praise to the film on \"Sneak Previews\"; the producers told Ebert that their praise helped keep the film in theaters for a year. Ebert later named it as the best film of the year. In 1999, he added it to his \"Great Movies\" essay series. He said, \"Someone asked me the other day if I could name a movie that was entirely devoid of clich√©s. I thought for a moment, and then answered, \"My Dinner with Andre\".\" The Boston Society of Film Critics Awards ranked it as the \"Best American Film\" in 1982, and awarded Gregory and Shawn its prize for Best Screenplay.\n\nThroughout the film, Andre references his wife \"Chiquita\"; in real life he was married to Mercedes \"Chiquita\" Nebelthau, who died in 1992. Nebelthau was a documentary filmmaker whose credits include three films about Jerzy Grotowski, whom Wally and Andre talk about in this film.\n\nThroughout the film, Wally references his \"girlfriend Debbie\". Though not actually identified, Debbie is the acclaimed short story writer Deborah Eisenberg, although she had not begun publishing stories at the time of the film. Eisenberg is also an extra in the film, a dark-haired diner Shawn glances at as he scans the restaurant while standing at the bar waiting for Andre.\n\n\nRichard Linklater is a big fan of \"My Dinner With Andre\" and considers this film to be a big influence on his own work.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "748797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=748797", "title": "Princeton Triangle Club", "text": "Princeton Triangle Club\n\nThe Princeton Triangle Club is a theater troupe at Princeton University. Founded in 1891, it is the oldest touring collegiate musical-comedy troupe in the United States, and the only co-ed collegiate troupe that takes an original student-written musical on a national tour every year. The club is known for its tradition of featuring an all-male kickline in drag.\n\nThe troupe presents several shows throughout the year. In September at the end of the University's Freshman Week it presents a revue of popular material from previous years. In autumn it puts on an original student-written musical comedy in McCarter Theatre, then takes this show on tour over the Winter holiday season. In spring it puts on another original show in a smaller venue. During reunions after the end of the spring semester, it relaunches the previous autumn's show at McCarter.\n\nAmong the club's notable alumni are F. Scott Fitzgerald, Booth Tarkington, Russel Wright, Joshua Logan, Brooks Bowman, Jimmy Stewart, Jos√© Ferrer, Wayne Rogers, Clark Gesner, Jeff Moss, David E. Kelley, Nicholas Hammond, Zachary Pincus-Roth, and Brooke Shields.\n\nThe history of the Princeton Triangle Club reflects many major social, cultural, economic, political, literary and theatrical trends in the United States during the late 19th and 20th centuries. It also traces the evolution of both undergraduate life and theatrical endeavors at Princeton University. In its century-plus of productions, Triangle has commented upon Princeton-specific topics, from examinations and campus safety to the Honor Code and the eating clubs, in addition to broader movements and events, including war protests, political scandals, women‚Äôs rights, and affirmative action. Although Triangle essentially recreates itself every year with an entirely new, full-scale musical-comedy, the club remains committed to its longstanding traditions, from the annual national tour to the kickline, and perpetuates its unique spirit, blending topical humor with collegiate irreverence and outright playfulness.\n\nTriangle‚Äôs history is documented in several ways. \"The Long Kickline: A History of the Princeton Triangle Club\", written in 1968 by Donald Marsden '64, provides a detailed chronology of the organization through the production of \"Sham on Wry\" in 1966-67. The senior thesis of Nancy Barnes ‚Äô91, \"One Hundred Years and Still Kicking: A History of the Princeton Triangle Club\", updates this written record. Finally, Triangle‚Äôs extensive archives in Princeton‚Äôs Mudd Library include playbills, musical scores, scripts, reviews, photographs, business correspondence, tour itineraries, scrapbooks, recordings, and much more.\n\nThe Triangle Club archives begin in 1883 with a production of the Princeton College Dramatic Association; during the next five years the Association presented a number of plays. In keeping with the practice of British and American all-male institutions at the time, women's roles were played by men. Entr'acte music, provided by the Instrumental or Banjo Clubs, consisted of popular dance tunes or operatic excerpts. Student theatricals were performed for the benefit of financially ailing athletic associations, and the sporadic activity of the Dramatic Association can be explained by the fluctuating fortunes of the sports teams.\n\nIn 1891 the Dramatic Association joined forces with the University Glee Club to present \"Po-ca-hon-tas\", the first show in the Triangle tradition of musicals written and produced by students. According to a New York review, the reworked John Brougham play featured \"new topical songs and local hits\" and was well received, both on campus and in a Trenton performance. But the faculty vetoed a proposed New York performance, and over the years, students and administrators would often be at odds over theatrical activities. Nevertheless, the Association visited Trenton once again the following year with \"Katharine\", a Shakespearean spoof marking the first appearance of Booth Tarkington 1893 in the Triangle records.\n\nThe 1893 production, \"The Honorable Julius Caesar\", was again a reworking of Shakespeare. Tarkington, a senior and president of the Dramatic Association, was prominent as both co-author of the book and as actor in the role of Cassius. The show was so successful that it was repeated the following year, with several significant changes. Most importantly, the Princeton University Dramatic Association had been renamed the Triangle Club of Princeton. According to a preview in The New York Times, \"several specialties will be introduced, such as tumbling, acrobatic feats, and dancing\" and \"James E. Wilson of Frohman's company‚Ä¶ will coach the club regularly four times a week.\" If Wilson did indeed coach, the club had its first professional director in its very first show under the name \"Triangle.\"\n\nFinancial problems caused Club members to curtail expenses in 1895. Neither the February production, \"Who's Who\", nor the May offering, \"Snowball\", were written by students, and both had relatively small casts. The following year the Club turned to a recent graduate, Post Wheeler '91, in hopes that his magic touch as co-author of \"The Honorable Julius Caesar\" could be repeated, and they were pleased with the result. \"The Mummy\" (1895‚Äì96) was also notable as the first production in Triangle's new home, the Casino, located on the lower campus near the present-day McCarter Theatre site. Yet another innovation was attempted in 1897. \"A Tiger Lily\", the first Triangle show to be based on Princeton student life, was part of a double bill with \"Lend Me Five Shillings\", a British farce. Since neither show was a great success, the Club returned to the tried and true in 1898 with a revival of \"Po-ca-hon-tas\". \"The Privateer\", presented in 1899, was originally entitled \"The Captain's Kidd Sister\", but the name was changed because the University of Pennsylvania‚Äôs Mask and Wig Club had already produced a show about Captain Kidd. The \"Privateer March\" was the first commercially published Triangle song.\n\nIn 1901, with \"The King of Pomeru\", Triangle ventured for the first time to New York, and the next year the club ventured as far as Pittsburgh. After the 1901 New York performance, Franklin B. Morse 1895 proposed a meeting to organize Triangle alumni, who he believed could help promote the Club, build its reputation, arrange the annual tour, collect materials and memorabilia, and generally socialize among themselves. In June of that year, thirty-seven alumni met in Princeton, and the Triangle Board of Trustees was established.\n\nDuring the first decade of the 20th century, the organization of Triangle became increasingly structured. Printed copies of the script, \"for the exclusive use of candidates,\" first appear in the archives with \"The Man From Where\" (1903‚Äì04).\n\nAlthough \"A Woodland Wedding\" (1899‚Äì1900) included a specialty skirt dance, and \"The Pony Ballet\" was a part of \"Tabasco Land\" (1905‚Äì06), \"The Mummy Monarch\"'s kickline in 1907 was the first of that tradition to be documented photographically in the Triangle Archives.\n\nBy 1910 the tour had extended as far west as Chicago and St. Louis; printed luncheon menus and newspaper clippings provide evidence of the elaborate social functions that were becoming part of the annual trek. With \"Once in a Hundred Years\" (1912‚Äì13), Triangle moved its tour to the Christmas season, again traveling as far west as St. Louis. The following year, President and Mrs. Wilson attended \"The Pursuit of Priscilla\"‚Äôs Washington matinee performance; the First Family then hosted a reception for Triangle at the White House.\n\n\"The Evil Eye\" (1915-16) had a distinguished pair of neophyte authors: Edmund Wilson '16 wrote the book, and F. Scott Fitzgerald '17 was responsible for the lyrics. Although he was never a cast member in a Triangle production, Fitzgerald wrote three shows for the Club between 1914 and 1917.\n\nDuring 1917-18, a four man Triangle troupe toured Europe to entertain the soldiers stationed there for World War I. After the year hiatus, the club became active again with a revival of \"The Honorable Julius Caesar\". The first post-war tour occurred when \"The Isle of Surprise\" was taken on the road during Christmas break of 1919. This show marked a change in attitude toward Triangle productions. In the program, Club president Erdman Harris '20 described the new production: \"We hope that a new day has dawned, that ‚ÄòJazz‚Äô will be forever relegated to a back seat, that Broadway will cease to be the idol of those who create the shows, that their staging shall be done in Princeton by Princeton men, and that the authorities and graduates will approve what is being done to elevate the standard of a society whose value in student life has been seriously questioned.\"\n\nIn the spring of 1922, Triangle staged George Bernard Shaw's \"The Devil's Disciple\". This production marked a milepost in the Club's history, for its three female roles were actually played by women. Sets for this production were designed and painted by Russel Wright during his freshman year, marking one of the few times that a freshman was ever allowed to join Triangle.\n\nDuring the early 1920s, New York performances began to be booked at the Metropolitan Opera House, although initially there was some concern whether the Club would be able to fill such a large theatre and whether the men's voices would be strong enough to be heard properly. Late in 1923, there were negotiations concerning a possible radio broadcast, and in the same year Triangle's music publisher, J. Church Co., corresponded with the Victor Talking Machine Co. about a trial recording. But the major event during this decade was the planning and construction of McCarter Theatre for Triangle Club. The completed theatre opened on February 21, 1930, with the Triangle Club‚Äôs \"The Golden Dog\". McCarter replaced the long-controversial Casino, which burned on January 8, 1924.\n\nHere began the Golden Period for which the Triangle Club became famous, in terms of its eventual contribution of outstanding talent to the Broadway theatre and Hollywood. Within a few years the Club would send forth into these professional realms Erik Barnouw '29; C. Norris Houghton, Joshua Logan, and Myron McCormick, all Class of 1931; James Stewart '32; Jos√© Ferrer '33; and Nick Foran '34.\n\nThe 1935 show, \"Stags at Bay\", featured \"East of the Sun (and West of the Moon),\" written by Brooks Bowman, which would become the most popular and longest-lasting national hit ever to come out of the Triangle Club. Recorded by Frank Sinatra and Louis Armstrong, among many others, \"East of the Sun\" still provides the club with royalties. Other songs from the same show, by Bowman, included \"Love and Dime\" and \"Will Love find a Way?.\"\n\nWith \"The Tiger Smiles\" (1930‚Äì31), Triangle writers returned to a Princeton town and gown setting for the first time since \"When Congress Came to Princeton\" (1908‚Äì09). The production was well received, but the Club was already beginning to feel the effects of the Great Depression. In October 1930, the Program Manager reported, \"Due to the financial depression, the business of getting ads is a rather difficult one just now.\" By the following year economic conditions had begun to affect the tour. South Orange reported poor ticket sales, and the local alumni chairman was concerned with keeping down the cost of stagehands; in Pittsburgh, a poor house and lack of entertainment were attributed to the weak stock market. \"When It's the Valet\" (1932‚Äì33) was ready to tour, local alumni groups were either unwilling to sponsor a show or unable to guarantee an adequate sum to cover expenses, let alone show a profit. The Club's Graduate Board sought aid from alumni in underwriting the show, but individual contributions were equally difficult to come by.\n\nThroughout the mid-thirties, Triangle continued to tour in spite of the Depression, but there were rumblings of discontent from both the Graduate Board of the Club and the University administration. In a 1934 meeting with President Dodds, the Board indicated concern about the financial condition of McCarter Theatre; Triangle profits were insufficient to keep McCarter operating in the black, a situation that would become increasingly serious as the decade wore on. President Dodds had also heard alumni criticism about poor acting and an apparent lack of coaching in connection with the latest show. Yet he remained confident that Triangle could play an important role on campus. Later that year, Club Manager Stryker Warren '35 received a stern letter from Dean of the College Christian Gauss. Gauss had considered canceling the Christmas tour, first because of financial considerations, and then because of alumni criticism, which \"in nearly every case‚Ä¶ came as the result of the excessive drinking on the part of a few of your men.\" Nevertheless, the Dean concluded by wishing \"you and all the officers and members of the Club a highly successful trip, a very merry Christmas and a happy New Year.\"\n\nAt a 1937 Board meeting there was discussion about the lack of good voices in Triangle. Alumni as well as Board members had noted this situation, and it was suggested that \"there must be someone in the Glee Club who could at least be drafted to sing, so that a song could be heard beyond the footlights.\" Another complaint came from a Louisville alumnus early in 1938, who wrote, \"I am not crazy about the Triangle Club bringing in certain dirty lines about ‚Äòbuying a drink‚Äô and ‚Äòthe Knights of the Garter,‚Äô etc.‚Ä¶. Personally I would prefer to see the young men get properly soused and have to be poured on the train than to use [these] lines.\"\n\nAnother change in tradition came during the 1941-42 academic year, when Triangle produced \"Ask Me Another\", its first show in revue format. Then, at a Board meeting in September 1943, Graduate Treasurer B. Franklin Bunn '07 announced that there would be no Triangle Club activities for the duration of the war. The University assumed control of McCarter Theatre during this period, and the building was leased by the military for trainees‚Äô use on campus.\n\nIn November 1945, the University Committee on Undergraduate Activities issued a report describing Triangle as \"perhaps the most controversial of all undergraduate extracurricular activities. Despite obvious shortcomings, the Club affords many valuable opportunities to the undergraduate body and plays a very real part in alumni relations. According, it should be reestablished at the first possible moment.\" The first post-war show, \"Clear the Track\", opened in December 1946 and even managed a seven-city tour. But Triangle was beset with problems the following year for \"All Rights Reserved\" (1947‚Äì48). The Daily Princetonian reported, \"All Rights pretty nearly weren't reserved. A play by the same name had fizzled on Broadway for a bare month, in 1934, and the petulant playwright threatened to sue. Hasty consultation with a Broadway lawyer revealed that the author could not possibly win the suit and that matter was closed.\" The club resolved tricky labor questions by employing union stagehands and music-hirelings, putting the later to work first in Philadelphia, where they were made to earn their fee by playing with the regular orchestra, and then in Washington, where they provided the intermission music.\n\nDespite ongoing debate in the 1950s about the club‚Äôs obligations to theatrical professionalism, as well as its questionable effect on the University‚Äôs reputation, Triangle continued to reach a wider audience through greater media exposure. In 1948, \"All in Favor\" was broadcast on WNBC-TV, becoming the first college show to appear on the new medium of television. The entire score of \"Too Hot for Toddy\" (1950‚Äì51) was recorded, and members of the cast appeared on \"The Kate Smith Show\" and \"Ed Sullivan's The Toast of the Town\". Club productions appeared on The \"Ed Sullivan Show\" from 1950 to 1957; its host wrote to Triangle President Charles Robinson, \"The Princeton Triangle Club has an annual appointment on our stage, so long as I‚Äôm on TV.\"\n\nFinally, in 1953, a memorandum of agreement was drawn up between Princeton University and the Trustees of the Triangle Club abrogating the McCarter agreement of the 1920s. The Club had simply been unable to cover the operating expenses and pay the taxes of the Theatre. A full-time general manager was hired for McCarter, and the University, which had been underwriting Triangle's losses, agreed to cancel the Club's debts.\n\n\"Spree de Corps\" (1955‚Äì56) marked the debut of Milton Lyon as Triangle director. From 1955 until his death forty years later, Lyon would direct all but a handful of Triangle's original productions.\n\nStudent apathy toward extracurricular activities began to affect Triangle toward the end of the 1950s. At a meeting in October 1958, the Board noted a very small turnout for the previous month's auditions. It was decided that more on-campus publicity would help, and as part of this effort Triangle Junior was formed, a group of seven club members who performed favorite Triangle songs at various receptions and functions. Over the following years, this small group would undergo periodic name changes, being known as \"Triangle Ding!\" and \"Triangle Bit Parts\" before returning to \"Ding!\", as it is called today.\n\nWith the gradual elimination of passenger trains in the late 1950s, the club began touring by bus. Early in 1960 there was a proposal to produce a motion picture on the Triangle Club, but a Hollywood writers' strike and possible heavy expenses brought an end to this publicity idea. However, Triangle did embark on its first European tour that summer; the Club performed \"Breakfast in Bedlam\" (1959‚Äì60) at French and German bases of the American army. \"Tour de Farce\" (1961‚Äì62) became perhaps the most widely toured show: performances in Pasadena and San Francisco marked the first time the show had been seen live on both coasts, and then troupe members again went to Europe that summer to perform at US Army bases.\n\n\"Funny Side Up\" (1963‚Äì64) was billed as the 75th anniversary show in spite of the fact that number seventy was \"Tour de Farce\", produced only two years earlier. \"Funny Side Up\" did not have a smooth start: the writers were slow to produce material, and the trustees even considered the possibility that there would be no show. Because of the diamond jubilee, twenty-one songs from earlier shows were made a part of the program. The tour of \"Funny Side Up\" included several southern stops, and the Birmingham visit became problematic when Triangle was booked into a segregated theatre. After some strongly worded letters from Board members, it was determined that the performance would either be cancelled or moved to a non-segregated house.\n\n\"A Different Kick\" (1968‚Äì69) was a Triangle milestone, featuring the first female undergraduate to be cast in a Club show‚ÄîSue Jean Lee '70, a junior in the Critical Languages Program. The University's shift to coeducation the next fall would have a profound effect on Triangle. \"Call a Spade a Shovel\" (1969‚Äì1970) featured six women in a seventeen-member cast. The social and political commentary of the show, most especially its anti-Vietnam War tones, which reflected the views of the Vietnam Veteran who was President and much of the country, unleashed an unprecedented storm of alumni protest and caused a mass audience walk-out at the Grosse Pointe tour performance.\n\nThis incident, along with growing budgetary and logistical concerns, caused the Board of Trustees to revise its production schedule. As per the May 1970 Report of the Board‚Äôs New Directions Committee, there was to be neither a December show nor a Christmas tour; instead, a spring show was promised, to be followed by a short tour. \"Cracked Ice\" opened in April 1971, was repeated for alumni in June, but did finally tour the following December. To cut expenses, the cast and crew stayed in private homes rather than hotels, and non-union halls were booked.\n\nThe Princeton Triangle Workshop made its debut in November 1972 with a presentation of \"The Fantasticks\" at the Princeton Inn Theater; the following March the Workshop produced \"Transitions\", described as \"five original plays and a multimedia extravaganza,\" in Wilcox Hall. This began a 25-year tradition of smaller fall productions to complement the full-scale, original spring shows. The fall productions of 1978, \"Happily Ever After\", and 1979, \"String of Pearls\", were both written by undergraduates. For the 1981 spring show, Triangle writers returned to the very roots of the club and based their book musical, \"Bold Type\", on Booth Tarkington's novel, \"A Gentleman from Indiana\".\n\nThe 1981 tour again returned to California, but with a revue of Triangle favorites, \"Fool's Gold\", rather than the spring show. The following year Triangle hired Miriam Fond, the first female director in the Club's history. Triangle finally found a permanent home for its fall productions when \"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\" opened at the Triangle Broadmead Theatre in November 1984. In the 1980s, the Club began to present produce revues of the best of Triangle early in the fall to introduce the freshman class to the organization.\n\nThe Club's centennial was celebrated in 1991 with a series of campus events throughout the year, including the spring show entitled \"The Older, the Better\", a large Firestone Library exhibition of more than 850 items from the Triangle Archives, and a fall reunion weekend of parties and performances. But how could the centennial celebration be held in 1991 when the fiftieth anniversary show was \"Once Over Lightly\", produced in 1938-39? After much debate, it had been decided that the first show in the true Triangle tradition of original work was \"Po-ca-hon-tas\" in 1891; hence the choice of 1991 for the one-hundredth anniversary.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the production schedule reverted to its original format, in which the McCarter show was presented in the fall of each academic year, followed a month later by that show‚Äôs tour. This change meant that in 1997-1998 the Club needed to generate two-full length musicals in fifteen months, almost twice the writing load of previous years. In September 1997, Triangle began a writing workshop to coordinate the efforts of the writers; this program was enormously successful, producing \"In Lava and War\" in April 1998 and \"101 Damnations\" in November 1998. By the spring of 1999, the corps of 21 writers had been so prolific that Triangle presented an extra, original spring show at Theatre Intime, entitled \"The Rude Olympics\". The 1999-2000 season saw the hundredth anniversary of the kickline in \"The Blair Arch Project\" (November 1999), as well as Triangle‚Äôs return to Theatre Intime in May with \"The Rude Olympics II: American Booty\". \"Puns of Steel\" (2000‚Äì2001) became the first Club show to record its score on a CD.\n\nSince the start of the 21st century, the Club has continued the production schedule begun in the 1990s, with a Freshman Week show in September, McCarter show in November, tour in late January to early February, spring show in late April / early May, and a reprise of the McCarter show in June. The smaller-scale spring show has moved from Theater Intime to the Whitman Theater. Recent years have seen the refinement of the Club's infrastructure, with continued development of the writing workshop and the shaping of a more active business team under the name \"TriBiz.\" The Club continues to receive a high level of regional recognition, with the 2007 fall show \"A Turnpike Runs Through It\" appearing in \"The New York Times\".\n\n\nAcademic Year / Show (if more than one show listed, the first is the Mainstage Show) <br>\n1890-1891 \"Po-ca-hon-tas, or The Gentle Savage\" <br>\n1891-1892 Katharine <br>\n1892-1893 The Honorable Julius Caesar <br>\n1893-1894 The Honorable Julius Caesar <br>\n1894-1895 Snowball; Who's Who <br>\n1895-1896 The Mummy <br>\n1896-1897 Lend Me Five Shillings; A Tiger Lily <br>\n1897-1898 Po-ca-hon-tas, or The Gentle Savage <br>\n1898-1899 The Privateer, or The Pirates of Pennsnec <br> \n1899-1900 A Woodland Wedding <br>\n1900-1901 The King of Pomeru <br>\n1901-1902 The King of Pomeru <br>\n1902-1903 The Mullah of Miasma <br>\n1903-1904 The Man From Where <br>\n1904-1905 The Pretenders <br>\n1905-1906 Tabasco Land <br>\n1906-1907 The Mummy Monarch <br>\n1907-1908 When Congress Went to Princeton <br>\n1908-1909 The Duchess of Bluffshire <br>\n1909-1910 His Honor the Sultan <br>\n1910-1911 Simply Cynthia <br>\n1911-1912 Main Street <br>\n1912-1913 Once in a Hundred Years <br>\n1913-1914 The Pursuit of Priscilla <br>\n1914-1915 Fie!

The sculpture was made between 1994 and 2004, on a rocky outcrop on the river Danube, at the Iron Gates, which form the border between Romania and Serbia. It is located near the city of Or»ôova in Romania. \n\nIt is the tallest rock relief in Europe.\n\nIt was commissioned by Romanian businessman Iosif Constantin DrƒÉgan and it took 10 years, from 1994 to 2004, for twelve sculptors to finish it. According to DrƒÉgan's website, the businessman purchased the rock in 1993, after which the Italian sculptor Mario Galeotti assessed the location and made an initial model. The first six years involved dynamiting the rock into the basic shape, and the remaining four years were devoted to completing the detail. \n\nUnder the face of Decebalus there is a Latin inscription which reads \"DECEBALUS REX‚ÄîDRAGAN FECIT\" (\"King Decebalus‚ÄîMade by DrƒÉgan\"). The carving was placed opposite an ancient memorial plaque, carved in the rock on the Serbian side of the river facing Romania. The plaque, known as the Tabula Traiana, records the completion of Trajan's military road along the Danube and thus commemorates the final defeat of Decebalus by Trajan in 105, and the absorption of the Dacian kingdom into the Roman Empire. DrƒÉgan wanted the Serbs to carve a giant head of a Roman Emperor, as if confronting Decebalus on the opposite side of the river, but the Serbs refused.\n\nDrƒÉgan was a leading figure in the protochronism movement, a nationalist ideology which attempted to portray Romania as the major cradle of civilisation and which identified Romania with an ancient Thracian empire that supposedly dominated central Europe. In this ideology, Dacia, the pre-Roman name of Romania, was the inheritor of this Thracian culture, a view expounded by DrƒÉgan in his book and journal \"No√¨, tracii\" (\"We Thracians\"). \n\nThe \"Fundatia Europeana Dragan\", DrƒÉgan's foundation, states that \"Giuseppe Costantino Dragan is a strong supporter of the theory that the original 'flame' of civilization started on the ancient territory of Romania and argues as much in his work\". DrƒÉgan saw the sculpture as a signpost to the cradle of civilisation. He is quoted saying, \"Anyone travelling towards 'Decebal Rex Dragan Fecit' is also travelling towards the origins of European civilization and will discover that a United Europe represents the natural course of history\".\n\nMichael Palin in his 2007 book \"New Europe\" described the colossal head: \n\nNick Thorpe in \"The Danube: A Journey Upriver from the Black Sea to the Black Forest\" writes, \n\n\n"}

The terms \"romanticism\" and \"realism\" have been used in varied ways, and are sometimes seen as opposed to one another.\n\nThe term has long standing in literary criticism. For example, Joseph Conrad's relationship to romantic realism is analyzed in Ruth M. Stauffer's 1922 book \"Joseph Conrad: His Romantic Realism\". Liam O'Flaherty's relationship to romantic realism is discussed in P.F. Sheeran's book \"The Novels of Liam O'Flaherty: A Study in Romantic Realism\". Fyodor Dostoyevsky is described as a romantic realist in Donald Fanger's book, \"Dostoevsky and Romantic Realism: A Study of Dostoevsky in Relation to Balzac, Dickens, and Gogol\". Historian Jacques Barzun argued that romanticism was falsely opposed to realism and declared that \"...the romantic realist does not blink his weakness, but exerts his power.\"\n\nThe term also has long standing in art criticism. Art scholar John Baur described it as \"a form of realism modified to express a romantic attitude or meaning\". According to Theodor W. Adorno, the term \"romantic realism\" was used by Joseph Goebbels to define the official doctrine of the art produced in Nazi Germany, although this usage did not achieve wide currency.\n\nNovelist and philosopher Ayn Rand described herself as a romantic realist, and many followers of Objectivism who work in the arts apply this term to themselves. As part of , Rand defined romantic realism as a portrayal of life \"as it could be and should be.\" She wrote: \"The method of romantic realism is to make life more beautiful and interesting than it actually is, yet give it all the reality, and even a more convincing reality than that of our everyday existence.\"\n\n\"Realism\" in music is often associated with the use of music for the depiction of objects, whether they be real (as in Bed≈ôich Smetana's \"Peasant Wedding\" of \"Die Moldau\") or mythological (as in Richard Wagner's Ring cycle). Musicologist Richard Taruskin discusses what he calls the \"black romanticism\" of Niccol√≤ Paganini and Franz Liszt, i.e., the development and use of musical techniques that can be used to depict or suggest \"grotesque\" creatures or objects, such as the \"laugh of the devil\", to create a \"frightening atmosphere.\" Thus, Taruskin's \"black romanticism\" is a form of \"romantic realism\" deployed by nineteenth-century virtuosi with the intent of invoking fear or \"the sublime.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "66491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66491", "title": "Socialist realism", "text": "Socialist realism\n\nSocialist realism is a style of idealized realistic art that was developed in the Soviet Union and was imposed as the official style in that country between 1932 and 1988, as well as in other socialist countries after World War II. Socialist realism is characterized by the glorified depiction of communist values, such as the emancipation of the proletariat, by means of realistic imagery. Although related, it should not be confused with social realism, a type of art that realistically depicts subjects of social concern.\n\nSocialist realism was the predominant form of approved art in the Soviet Union from its development in the early 1920s to its eventual fall from official status beginning in the late 1960s until the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. While other countries have employed a prescribed canon of art, socialist realism in the Soviet Union persisted longer and was more restrictive than elsewhere in Europe.\n\nSocialist realism was developed by many thousands of artists, across a diverse society, over several decades. Early examples of realism in Russian art include the work of the Peredvizhnikis and Ilya Yefimovich Repin. While these works do not have the same political connotation, they exhibit the techniques exercised by their successors. After the Bolsheviks took control of Russia on October 25, 1917, there was a marked shift in artistic styles. There had been a short period of artistic exploration in the time between the fall of the Tsar and the rise of the Bolsheviks.\n\nShortly after the Bolsheviks took control, Anatoly Lunacharsky was appointed as head of Narkompros, the People's Commissariat for Enlightenment. This put Lunacharsky in the position of deciding the direction of art in the newly created Soviet state. Although Lunacharsky did not dictate a single aesthetic model for Soviet artists to follow, he developed a system of aesthetics based on the human body that would later help to influence socialist realism. He believed that \"the sight of a healthy body, intelligent face or friendly smile was essentially life-enhancing.\" He concluded that art had a direct effect on the human organism and under the right circumstances that effect could be positive. By depicting \"the perfect person\" (New Soviet man), Lunacharsky believed art could educate citizens on how to be the perfect Soviets.\n\nThere were two main groups debating the fate of Soviet art: futurists and traditionalists. Russian Futurists, many of whom had been creating abstract or leftist art before the Bolsheviks, believed communism required a complete rupture from the past and, therefore, so did Soviet art. Traditionalists believed in the importance of realistic representations of everyday life. Under Lenin's rule and the New Economic Policy, there was a certain amount of private commercial enterprise, allowing both the futurists and the traditionalists to produce their art for individuals with capital. By 1928, the Soviet government had enough strength and authority to end private enterprises, thus ending support for fringe groups such as the futurists. At this point, although the term \"socialist realism\" was not being used, its defining characteristics became the norm.\n\nThe first time the term \"socialist realism\" was officially used was in 1932. The term was settled upon in meetings that included politicians of the highest level, including Stalin himself. Maxim Gorky, a proponent of literary socialist realism, published a famous article titled \"Socialist Realism\" in 1933 and by 1934 the term's etymology was traced back to Stalin. During the Congress of 1934, four guidelines were laid out for socialist realism.\nThe work must be:\n\nThe purpose of socialist realism was to limit popular culture to a specific, highly regulated faction of emotional expression that promoted Soviet ideals. The party was of the utmost importance and was always to be favorably featured. The key concepts that developed assured loyalty to the party, \"partiinost'\" (party-mindedness), \"ideinost\" (idea- or ideological-content), \"klassovost\" (class content), \"pravdivost\" (truthfulness).\n\nThere was a prevailing sense of optimism, socialist realism's function was to show the ideal Soviet society. Not only was the present gloried, but the future was also supposed to be depicted in an agreeable fashion. Because the present and the future were constantly idealized, socialist realism had a sense of forced optimism. Tragedy and negativity were not permitted, unless they were shown in a different time or place. This sentiment created what would later be dubbed \"revolutionary romanticism.\"\n\nRevolutionary romanticism elevated the common worker, whether factory or agricultural, by presenting his life, work, and recreation as admirable. Its purpose was to show how much the standard of living had improved thanks to the revolution. Art was used as educational information. By illustrating the party's success, artists were showing their viewers that sovietism was the best political system. Art was also used to show how Soviet citizens should be acting. The ultimate aim was to create what Lenin called \"an entirely new type of human being\": The \"New Soviet Man\". Art (especially posters and murals) was a way to instill party values on a massive scale. Stalin described the socialist realist artists as \"engineers of souls.\"\n\nCommon images used in socialist realism were flowers, sunlight, the body, youth, flight, industry, and new technology. These poetic images were used to show the utopianism of communism and the Soviet state. Art became more than an aesthetic pleasure; instead it served a very specific function. Soviet ideals placed functionality and work above all else; therefore, for art to be admired, it must serve a purpose. Georgi Plekhanov, a Marxist theoretician, states that art is useful if it serves society: \"There can be no doubt that art acquired a social significance only in so far as it depicts, evokes, or conveys \"actions, emotions and events that are of significance to society\".\"\n\nThe artist could not, however, portray life just as they saw it because anything that reflected poorly on Communism had to be omitted. People who could not be shown as either wholly good or wholly evil could not be used as characters. This was reflective of the Soviet idea that morality is simple: things are either right or wrong. This view on morality called for idealism over realism. Art was filled with health and happiness: paintings showed busy industrial and agricultural scenes; sculptures depicted workers, sentries, and schoolchildren.\n\nCreativity was not an important part of socialist realism: it was actually rejected. The styles used in creating art during this period were those that would produce the most realistic results. Painters would depict happy, muscular peasants and workers in factories and collective farms. During the Stalin period, they produced numerous heroic portraits of the dictator to serve his cult of personality‚Äîall in the most realistic fashion possible. The most important thing for a socialist realist artist was not artistic integrity but adherence to party doctrine. The results were often sentimental kitsch.\n\nThe Association of Artists of Revolutionary Russia (AKhRR) was established in 1922 and was one of the most influential artist groups in the USSR. The AKhRR worked to truthfully document contemporary life in Russia by utilizing \"heroic realism\". The term \"heroic realism\" was beginning of the socialist realism archetype. AKhRR was sponsored by influential government officials such as Leon Trotsky and carried favor with the Red Army.\n\nIn 1928, the AKhRR was renamed to Association of Artists of the Revolution (AKhR) in order to include the rest of the Soviet states. At this point the group had begun participating in state promoted mass forms of art like murals, jointly made paintings, advertisement production and textile design. The group was disbanded April 23, 1932 by the decree \"On the Reorganization of Literary and Artistic Organizations\" serving as the nucleus for the stalinist USSR Union of Artists.\n\nWhile the Society of Easel Painters (OSt) was also focused on the glorification of the revolution they, as per their name, worked individually as easel painters. The most common subjects of the OSt's works fit with the developing socialist realism trope. Their paintings consisted of sport and battle, industry and modern technology.\n\nThe OSt broke up in 1931 due to some members' demand to transition to collective print and poster work. Some prominent members include Aleksandr Deyneka (till 1928), Yuri Pimanov, Aleksandr Labas, Pyotr Vilyams, all of whom were students or ex-students of Moscow's art school, Vkhutemas.\n\nThe impact of socialist realism art can still be seen and felt decades after it was no longer the only state supported style. Even before the end of the USSR in 1991, the government had been loosening its hold on censorship. After Stalin's death in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev began to condemn the previous regime's practice of excessive restrictions. This freedom allowed artists to begin experimenting with new techniques, but the shift was not immediate. It was not until the ultimate fall of Soviet rule that artists were no longer restricted by the communist party. Many socialist realism tendencies prevailed until the mid-to-late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nIn the 1990s, many Russian artists used socialist realism characteristics in an ironic fashion. This was a complete rupture from what existed only a couple of decades before. Once artists broke from the socialist realism mold there was a significant power shift. Artists began including subjects that could not exist according to Soviet ideals. Now that the power over appearances was taken away from the government, artists achieved a level of authority that had not existed since the early 20th century. In the decade immediately after the fall of the USSR, artists represented socialist realism and the Soviet legacy as a traumatic event. By the next decade, there was a unique sense of detachment.\n\nWestern cultures often do not look at socialist realism positively. Democratic countries view the art produced during this period of repression as a lie. Non-Marxist cultures tend to view communism as a form of totalitarianism that smothers artistic expression and therefore retards the progress of culture. Western cultures often look at socialist realistic works as propaganda rather than art. Artistically it could be seen as grandiose, and as sentimental kitsch.\n\nMaxim Gorky's novel \"Mother\" is usually considered to have been the first socialist-realist novel. Gorky was also a major factor in the school's rapid rise, and his pamphlet, \"On Socialist Realism\", essentially lays out the needs of Soviet art. Other important works of literature include Fyodor Gladkov's \"Cement\" (1925), Nikolai Ostrovsky's \"How the Steel Was Tempered\" and Mikhail Sholokhov's two volume epic, \"Quiet Flows the Don\" (1934) and \"The Don Flows Home to the Sea\" (1940). Yury Krymov's novel \"Tanker \"Derbent\"\" (1938) portrays Soviet merchant seafarers being transformed by the Stakhanovite movement.\n\nMartin Andersen Nex√∏ developed socialist realism in his own way. His creative method featured a combination of publicistic passion, a critical view of capitalist society, and a steadfast striving to bring reality into accord with socialist ideals. The novel \"Pelle, the Conqueror\" is considered to be a classic of socialist realism. The novel \"Ditte, Daughter of Man\" had a working-class woman as its heroine. He battled against the enemies of socialism in the books \"Two Worlds\", and \"Hands Off!\".\n\nThe novels of Louis Aragon, such as \"The Real World\", depict the working class as a rising force of the nation. He published two books of documentary prose, \"The Communist Man\". In the collection of poems \"A Knife in the Heart Again\", Aragon criticizes the penetration of American imperialism into Europe. The novel \"The Holy Week\" depicts the artist's path toward the people against a broad social and historical background.\n\nHanns Eisler composed many workers' songs, marches, and ballads on current political topics such as \"Song of Solidarity\", \"Song of the United Front\", and \"Song of the Comintern\". He was a founder of a new style of revolutionary song for the masses. He also composed works in larger forms such as \"Requiem for Lenin\". Eisler's most important works include the cantatas \"German Symphony\", \"Serenade of the Age\" and \"Song of Peace\". Eisler combines features of revolutionary songs with varied expression. His symphonic music is known for its complex and subtle orchestration.\n\nClosely associated with the rise of the labor movement was the development of the revolutionary song, which was performed at demonstrations and meetings. Among the most famous of the revolutionary songs are \"The Internationale\" and \"Whirlwinds of Danger\". Notable songs from Russia include \"Boldly, Comrades, in Step\", \"Workers' Marseillaise\", and \"Rage, Tyrants\". Folk and revolutionary songs influenced the Soviet mass songs. The mass song was a leading genre in Soviet music, especially during the 1930s and the war. The mass song influenced other genres, including the art song, opera, and film music. The most popular mass songs include Dunaevsky's \"Song of the Homeland\", Blanter's \"Katiusha\", Novikov's \"Hymn of Democratic Youth of the World\", and Aleksandrov's \"Sacred War\".\n\nIn the early 1930s, Soviet filmmakers applied socialist realism in their work. Notable films include \"Chapaev\", which shows the role of the people in the history-making process. The theme of revolutionary history was developed in films such as \"The Youth of Maxim\", by Grigori Kozintsev and Leonid Trauberg, \"Shchors\" by Dovzhenko, and \"We are from Kronstadt\" by E. Dzigan. The shaping of the new man under socialism was a theme of films such as \"A Start Life\" by N. Ekk, \"Ivan\" by Dovzhenko, \"Valerii Chkalov\" by M. Kalatozov and the film version of \"Tanker \"Derbent\"\" (1941). Some films depicted the part of peoples of the Soviet Union against foreign invaders: \"Alexander Nevsky\" by Eisenstein, \"Minin and Pozharsky\" by Pudvokin, and \"Bogdan Khmelnitsky\" by Savchenko. Soviet politicians were the subjects in films such as Yutkevich's trilogy of movies about Lenin.\n\nSocialist realism was also applied to Hindi films of the 1940s and 1950s. These include Chetan Anand's \"Neecha Nagar\" (1946), which won the Grand Prize at the 1st Cannes Film Festival, and Bimal Roy's \"Two Acres of Land\" (1953), which won the International Prize at the 7th Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe painter Aleksandr Deineka provides a notable example for his expressionist and patriotic scenes of the Second World War, collective farms, and sports. Yuriy Pimenov, Boris Ioganson and Geli Korzev have also been described as \"unappreciated masters of twentieth-century realism\". Another well-known practitioner was Fyodor Pavlovich Reshetnikov.\n\nSocialist realism art found acceptance in the Baltic nations, inspiring many artists. One such artist was Czeslaw Znamierowski (23 May 1890 ‚Äì 9 August 1977), a Soviet Lithuanian painter, known for his large panoramic landscapes and love of nature. Znamierowski combined these two passions to create very notable paintings in the Soviet Union, earning the prestigious title of Honorable Artist of LSSR in 1965. Born in Latvia, which formed part of the Russian Empire at the time, Znamierowski was of Polish nationality and Lithuanian citizenship, a country where he lived for most of his life and died. He excelled in landscapes and social realism, and held many exhibitions. Znamierowski was also widely published in national newspapers, magazines and books. His more notable paintings include \"Before Rain\" (1930), \"Panorama of Vilnius City\" (1950), \"The Green Lake\" (1955), and \"In Klaipeda Fishing Port\" (1959).A large collection of his art is located in the Lithuanian Art Museum.\n\n\"Thol\", a novel by D. Selvaraj in Tamil is a standing example of Marxist Realism in India. It won a literary award (Sahithya Akademi) for the year 2012.\n\nIn conjunction with the Socialist Classical style of architecture, socialist realism was the officially approved type of art in the Soviet Union for more than fifty years. All material goods and means of production belonged to the community as a whole; this included means of producing art, which were also seen as powerful propaganda tools.\n\nIn the early years of the Soviet Union, Russian and Soviet artists embraced a wide variety of art forms under the auspices of Proletkult. Revolutionary politics and radical non-traditional art forms were seen as complementary. In art, Constructivism flourished. In poetry, the non-traditional and the avant-garde were often praised.\n\nThese styles of art were later rejected by members of the Communist Party who did not appreciate modern styles such as Impressionism and Cubism. Socialist realism was, to some extent, a reaction against the adoption of these \"decadent\" styles. It was thought by Lenin that the non-representative forms of art were not understood by the proletariat and could therefore not be used by the state for propaganda.\n\nAlexander Bogdanov argued that the radical reformation of society to communist principles meant little if any bourgeois art would prove useful; some of his more radical followers advocated the destruction of libraries and museums. Lenin rejected this philosophy, deplored the rejection of the beautiful because it was old, and explicitly described art as needing to call on its heritage: \"Proletarian culture must be the logical development of the store of knowledge mankind has accumulated under the yoke of capitalist, landowner, and bureaucratic society.\"\n\nModern art styles appeared to refuse to draw upon this heritage, thus clashing with the long realist tradition in Russia and rendering the art scene complex. Even in Lenin's time, a cultural bureaucracy began to restrain art to fit propaganda purposes. Leon Trotsky's arguments that a \"proletarian literature\" was un-Marxist because the proletariat would lose its class characteristics in the transition to a classless society, however, did not prevail.\n\nSocialist realism became state policy in 1934 when the First Congress of Soviet Writers met and Stalin's representative Andrei Zhdanov gave a speech strongly endorsing it as \"the official style of Soviet culture\". It was enforced ruthlessly in all spheres of artistic endeavour. Form and content were often limited, with erotic, religious, abstract, surrealist, and expressionist art being forbidden. Formal experiments, including internal dialogue, stream of consciousness, nonsense, free-form association, and cut-up were also disallowed. This was either because they were \"decadent\", unintelligible to the proletariat, or counter-revolutionary.\n\nIn response to the 1934 Congress in Russia, the most important American writers of the left gathered in the First American Writers Congress of 26‚Äì27 April 1935 in Chicago at meetings that were supported by Stalin. Waldo David Frank was the first president of the League of American Writers, which was backed by the Communist Party USA. A number of novelists balked at the control, and the League broke up at the invasion of the Soviet Union by German forces.\n\nThe first exhibition organized by the Leningrad Union of Artists took place in 1935. Its participants ‚Äì Mikhail Avilov, Isaak Brodsky, Piotr Buchkin, Nikolai Dormidontov, Rudolf Frentz, Kazimir Malevich, Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin, and Alexander Samokhvalov among them ‚Äì became the founding fathers of the Leningrad school, while their works formed one of its richest layers and the basis of the largest museum collections of Soviet painting of the 1930s-1950s.\nIn 1932, the Leningrad Institute of Proletarian Visual Arts was transformed into the Institute of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture (since 1944 named Ilya Repin). The fifteen-year period of constant reformation of the country's largest art institute came to an end. Thus, basic elements of the Leningrad school ‚Äì namely, a higher art education establishment of a new type and a unified professional union of Leningrad artists, were created by the end of 1932.\n\nIn 1934 Isaak Brodsky, a disciple of Ilya Repin, was appointed director of the National Academy of Arts and the Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture. Brodsky invited distinguished painters and pedagogues to teach at the Academy, namely Semion Abugov, Mikhail Bernshtein, Ivan Bilibin, Piotr Buchkin, Efim Cheptsov, Rudolf Frentz, Boris Ioganson, Dmitry Kardovsky, Alexander Karev, Dmitry Kiplik, Yevgeny Lansere, Alexander Lubimov, Matvey Manizer, Vasily Meshkov, Pavel Naumov, Alexander Osmerkin, Anna Ostroumova-Lebedeva, Leonid Ovsyannikov, Nikolai Petrov, Sergei Priselkov, Nikolay Punin, Nikolai Radlov, Konstantin Rudakov, Pavel Shillingovsky, Vasily Shukhaev, Victor Sinaisky, Ivan Stepashkin, Konstantin Yuon, and others.\n\nArt exhibitions of 1935‚Äì1940 serve as counterpoint to claims that the artistic life of the period was suppressed by the ideology and artists submitted entirely to what was then called \"social order\". A great number of landscapes, portraits, and genre paintings exhibited at the time pursued purely technical purposes and were thus ostensibly free from any ideology. Genre painting was also approached in a similar way.\n\nIn the post-war period between the mid-fifties and sixties, the Leningrad school of painting was approaching its vertex. New generations of artists who had graduated from the Academy (Repin Institute of Arts) in the 1930s‚Äì50s were in their prime. They were quick to present their art, they strived for experiments, and were eager to appropriate a lot and to learn even more.\n\nTheir time and contemporaries, with all its images, ideas, and dispositions found it full expression in portraits by Vladimir Gorb, Boris Korneev, Engels Kozlov, Felix Lembersky, Oleg Lomakin, Samuil Nevelshtein, Victor Oreshnikov, Semion Rotnitsky, Lev Russov, and Leonid Steele; in landscapes by Nikolai Galakhov, Vasily Golubev, Dmitry Maevsky, Sergei Osipov, Vladimir Ovchinnikov, Alexander Semionov, Arseny Semionov, and Nikolai Timkov; and in genre paintings by Andrey Milnikov, Yevsey Moiseenko, Mikhail Natarevich, Yuri Neprintsev, Nikolai Pozdneev, Mikhail Trufanov, Yuri Tulin, Nina Veselova, and others.\n\nIn 1957, the first all-Russian Congress of Soviet artists took place in Moscow. In 1960, the all-Russian Union of Artists was organized. Accordingly, these events influenced the art life in Moscow, Leningrad, and the provinces. The scope of experimentation was broadened; in particular, this concerned the form of painterly and plastic language. Images of youths and students, rapidly changing villages and cities, virgin lands brought under cultivation, grandiose construction plans being realized in Siberia and the Volga region, and great achievements of Soviet science and technology became the chief topics of the new painting. Heroes of the time ‚Äì young scientists, workers, civil engineers, physicians, etc. ‚Äì were made the most popular heroes of paintings.\nIn this period, life provided artists with plenty of thrilling topics, positive figures, and images. Legacy of many great artists and art movements became available for study and public discussion again. This greatly broadened artists' understanding of the realist method and widened its possibilities. It was the repeated renewal of the very conception of realism that made this style dominate Russian art throughout its history. Realist tradition gave rise to many trends of contemporary painting, including painting from nature, \"severe style\" painting, and decorative art. However, during this period impressionism, postimpressionism, cubism, and expressionism also had their fervent adherents and interpreters.\n\nThe restrictions were relaxed somewhat after Stalin's death in 1953, but the state still kept a tight rein on personal artistic expression. This caused many artists to choose to go into exile, for example the Odessa Group from the city of that name. Independent-minded artists that remained continued to feel the hostility of the state.\n\nIn 1974, for instance, a show of unofficial art in a field near Moscow was broken up and the artwork destroyed with a water cannon and bulldozers (see Bulldozer Exhibition). Mikhail Gorbachev's policies of glasnost and perestroika facilitated an explosion of interest in alternative art styles in the late 1980s, but socialist realism remained in limited force as the official state art style until as late as 1991. It was not until after the fall of the Soviet Union that artists were finally freed from state censorship.\n\nAfter the Russian Revolution, socialist realism became an international literary movement. Socialist trends in literature were established in the 1920s in Germany, France, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. Writers who helped develop socialist realism in the West included Louis Aragon, Johannes Becher, and Pablo Neruda.\n\nThe doctrine of socialist realism in other People's Republics, was legally enforced from 1949 to 1956. It involved all domains of visual and literary arts, though its most spectacular achievements were made in the field of architecture, considered a key weapon in the creation of a new social order, intended to help spread the communist doctrine by influencing citizens' consciousness as well as their outlook on life. During this massive undertaking, a crucial role fell to architects perceived not as merely engineers creating streets and edifices, but rather as \"engineers of the human soul\" who, in addition to extending simple aesthetics into urban design, were to express grandiose ideas and arouse feelings of stability, persistence and political power.\n\nToday, arguably the only countries still focused on these aesthetic principles are North Korea, Laos, and to some extent Vietnam. The People's Republic of China occasionally reverts to socialist realism for specific purposes, such as idealised propaganda posters to promote the Chinese space program. Socialist realism had little mainstream impact in the non-Communist world, where it was widely seen as a totalitarian means of imposing state control on artists.\n\nThe former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was an important exception among the communist countries, because after the Tito-Stalin split in 1948, it abandoned socialist realism along with other elements previously imported from the Soviet system and allowed greater artistic freedom. Miroslav Krle≈æa, one of the leading Yugoslav intellectuals, gave a speech at the Third Congress of the Writers Alliance of Yugoslavia held in Ljubljana in 1952, which is considered a turning point in the Yugoslav denouncement of dogmatic socialist realism.\n\n\n\n"}

The committee was composed with the painters Eug√®ne Delacroix, Carrier-Belleuse, Puvis de Chavannes and among the exhibitors were L√©on Bonnat, Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, Charles-Fran√ßois Daubigny, Gustave Dor√©, Manet. In 1864, just after the death of Delacroix, the society organized a retrospective exhibition of 248 paintings and lithographs of this famous painter and step-uncle of the emperor - and ceased to mount further exhibitions.\n\nThe 19th century in French art is characterised by a continuous struggle between traditionally educated artists supported by official politics, and a growing rate of artists who preferred to work individually and at their own riscs. Reviewing the historical situation is difficult, even a century later. But evidently opponents to the official politics gained ground after the fall of the 2nd Empire, and were instrumental to redirect French cultural politics to liberal positions. Thus, the splitting-off of the \"Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts\" in 1890 can be considered as the first \"Secessionist\" manifestation, at all.\n\nIn 1890, the \"Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts\" was re-vitalised under the rule of Puvis de Chavannes, Ernest Meissonier, Carolus-Duran, Bracquemond and Carrier-Belleuse, and since then its annual exhibition was reviewed as the \"Salon de Champ-de-Mars\", traditionally opening a fortnight later than the official \"Salon de Champs-√âlys√©es\", organised by the Soci√©t√© des artistes fran√ßais.\n\nSuzanne Valadon became the first female painter to be admitted to the Soci√©t√© in 1894.\n\nAfter World War I, in 1926, the \"Puvis de Chavannes\" prize was created consisting in a retrospective exhibition of the main works of the prizewinning artists, in Paris. During the twentieth century, this exhibition was located at the Grand Palais or the Mus√©e d'Art Moderne.\n\nMost famous awarded painters: 1941: Wilhem Van Hasselt, 1944: Jean Gabriel Domergue, 1952: Tristan Klingsor, 1955: Georges Delplanque, 1957: Albert Decaris, 1958: Jean Picard Le Doux, 1963: Maurice Boitel, 1966: Pierre Gaillardot, 1968: Pierre-Henry, 1969:Louis Vuillermoz, 1970: Daniel du Janerand, 1971: Jean-Pierre Alaux; 1975: Jean Monneret, 1987: Andr√© Hambourg.\n\nDuring the last decades of the 20th century, after \"living treasure\" Takanori Oguiss, and during the rule of chairman Fran√ßois Baboulet, some of Japanese artists could exhibit their paintings as guests of the SNBA: Takaaki Matsuda, Katsufumi Toyota, Kazuko Kobayashi, Hideo Hando, Yoko Tsuishi and Noboru Sotoyama.\n\n\n"}

In 1979, she acquired some land on top of an Etruscan ruin in Garavicchio, Tuscany, about 100 km north-west of Rome along the coast. There she built the Giardino dei Tarocchi, containing twenty-two monumental figures representing her idea of the greater Mysteries of the tarot, constructed of reinforced concrete and covered with mirrors and ceramic mosaic. The figures can be walked through; the artist lived inside the sphinx-like \"Empress\" for several months during the construction of the garden.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10408232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10408232", "title": "The Love Letter (Vermeer)", "text": "The Love Letter (Vermeer)\n\nThe Love Letter () is a 17th-century genre painting by Jan Vermeer. The painting shows a servant maid handing a letter to a young woman with a cittern. The painting is in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam.\n\nThe tied-up curtain in the foreground creates the impression that the viewer is looking at an intensely private, personal scene. There is also an element of trompe l'oeil as Dutch paintings were often hung with little curtains to conserve them, and the device of painted curtains is seen in other Dutch works of the period. The diagonals on the chequered floor create the impression of depth and three-dimensionality. The fact that it is a love letter that the woman has received is made clear by the fact that she is carrying a lute (more specifically, a cittern, a member of the lute/guitar family). The lute was a symbol of love - often carnal love; \"luit\" was also a slang term for vagina. This idea is further reinforced by the slippers at the very bottom of the picture. The removed slipper was another symbol of sex. The floor brush would appear to represent domesticity, and its placement at the side of the painting may suggest that domestic concerns have been forgotten or pushed aside.\n\nThe colors blue and gold are important in the composition of the painting - the gold is located on the woman's dress, the top of the fireplace, and many of the objects, which complements the blue on the floor, the maid's dress, the picture frames, etc. Classical influence is also apparent in the ionic columns of the fireplace.\n\nThe two paintings on the wall are also significant. The lower painting is of a stormy sea, a clear metaphor for tempestuous love. Above it is a landscape painting of a traveler on a sandy road. This may refer to the absence of the man who is writing to the lady.\n\nIn the second half of the 17th century, the painting probably found its place in the collection of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth's monarch John III Sobieski. The 1696 inventory of the Wilan√≥w Palace in Warsaw lists among Dutch paintings \"a painting of a lady, playing a lute in a golden robe, while a girl gives her a letter in the black frames (obraz damy, grajƒÖcej na lutni w z≈Çotej szacie, a dziewczyna list jey oddaje w ramach czarnych)\".\n\nOn September 23, 1971, the painting was stolen from its display at The Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels, where it was on loan from the Rijksmuseum. The thief, 21-year-old Mario Pierre Roymans, had locked himself in an electrical closet till the museum was closed. He then took the painting off the wall and tried to escape out of a window. However, when the frame failed to fit through the window, he cut the canvas from its frame with a potato peeler and hid the strip in his back pocket. Roymans first concealed the painting in his room at his place of work, The Soetewey (or Soete-Wey) Hotel. Later he buried it in a forest, but when it started to rain, he recovered it and hid it in his room inside his pillowcase.\n\nRoymans is thought to have been motivated by news of the bloodshed, rape, and murder in the 1971 Bangladesh genocide. On October 3, 1971, using the name \"Tijl van Limburg\" (a character similar to Robin Hood), Roymans contacted the Brussels newspaper \"Le Soir\" and asked for a reporter to meet him in a forest with a camera. He drove the reporter, blindfolded, to a church and unveiled the painting from a white cloth cover. After letting the reporter take photos of the canvas in the car's headlights, he drove him back. He told the reporter that he actually loved art, but also loved humanity. After the encounter, the pictures were published, alongside Roymans' conditions: 200 million Belgian francs to be given to famine-stricken Bengali refugees in East Pakistan. Roymans also requested the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and the Centre for Fine Arts in Brussels organize campaigns in their respective countries to raise money to combat world famine. Roymans set the deadline for Wednesday, October 6.\n\nThe police took the photographs as evidence and asked an art expert to validate that they were of the actual painting. It was confirmed they were, but immediately after the confirmation, the director of the Rijksmuseum, Arthur van Schendel said that the photos were not sufficient proof of authenticity. In the following days Roymans continued to make contact with the media; when he was finally apprehended by police, on the day of his deadline, he was trying to call a news station. \n\nThe painting was returned to the Rijksmuseum on October 8 but wasn't announced to the public until October 11. It was in very poor condition after being cut out of its stretcher bars and frame. The restoration took almost a year. Roymans was given a court fine and sentenced to two years in prison, but only served six months in the end.\n\n\n"}

It is an example of Dutch Golden Age painting and is part of the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nThe woman is looking at the viewer and according to art historian Walter Liedtke, \"spills out of her dress\". Liedtke goes on to make this a case for considering it a genre work rather than a portrait, comparing it with other scantily clad lute players that may have influenced the painter, such as the earlier works of Gerrit van Honthorst and contemporary work such as by Ferdinand Bol:\nLiedtke wonders if it could possibly a portrait of the artist's wife, as has sometimes been claimed for the female pendant of a shepherd by Van der Helst that has often been claimed to be a self-portrait:\nThis work is the only surviving painting in the Metropolitan Museum of Art that was acquired before 1906 and after the initial purchase of 1871, and though it is officially recorded as entering the collection in 1873, Liedtke mentions that it was grouped as one of two paintings that came into the collection in 1872 after the initial 1871 purchase, but also via the same vice-president of the Board of Trustees William T. Blodgett and presumably therefore via his dealer Leon Gauchez. The other painting (accession number 73.1) was a double portrait by Carel de Moor, but it was deaccessioned in 1988.\n\nThe art historian J.J. de Gelder mentioned the lute shown in the painting is a theorbe and it rests on a viola de gamba. He found the landscape reminiscent of Jan Baptist Weenix. The Van der Helst scholar Judith van Gent dismisses both this painting and the Granida as a portrait of the artist's wife Anna du Pire based on the age of the painter and his wife at the time. She notes Liedtke's comparison to the other Dutch lute players in the MET collection, namely Vermeer's \"Woman with a Lute\", where the woman is also tuning the lute, and Gerard ter Borch's \"A Woman Playing the Theorbo-Lute and a Cavalier\". She wonders whether the act of tuning a lute used to have a meaning that is now lost on us. \nThe Vermeer was donated to the MET's collection in 1900, and the Ter Borch in 1914, both of which had been recently imported to the US, probably also based on the popularity at the time of this painting.\n\n"}
