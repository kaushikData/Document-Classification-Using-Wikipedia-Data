{"id": "53071895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53071895", "title": "A Disquisition on Government", "text": "A Disquisition on Government\n\nA Disquisition on Government is a political treatise written by U.S. Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina and published posthumously in 1851. Written in response to what Calhoun saw as the growing subjugation of the Southern United States by the more populous North, especially in terms of Northern promotion of tariff legislation and opposition to slavery, the 100-page \"Disquisition\" promotes the idea of a concurrent majority in order to protect what he perceived to be the South's interests. The \"Disquisition\", and other writings like it by Southern Fire-Eaters, increased the feeling of sectionalism in the South and led ultimately to secession and the American Civil War.\n\nCalhoun died in 1850, and the \"Disquisition\" was published the following year.\n\nThe \"Disquisition on Government\" is a 100-page essay on Calhoun's definitive and comprehensive ideas on government, which he worked on intermittently for six years until its 1849 completion. It systematically presents his arguments that a numerical majority in any government will typically impose a despotism over a minority unless some way is devised to secure the assent of all classes, sections, and interests and, similarly, that innate human depravity would debase government in a democracy.\n\nCalhoun offered the concurrent majority as the key to achieving consensus, a formula by which a minority interest had the option to nullify objectionable legislation passed by a majority interest. The consensus would be effected by this tactic of nullification, a veto that would suspend the law within the boundaries of the state.\n\nVeto power was linked to the right of secession, which portended anarchy and social chaos. Constituencies would call for compromise to prevent this outcome. With a concurrent majority in place, the U.S. Constitution as interpreted by the Federal Judiciary would no longer exert collective authority over the various states. According to the Supremacy Clause located in Article 6, laws made by the federal government are the \"supreme law of the land\" only when they are made \"in pursuance\" of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThese ideas are convincing if one shares Calhoun's conviction that a functioning concurrent majority never leads to stalemate in the legislature; rather, talented statesmen, practiced in the arts of conciliation and compromise would pursue \"the common good\", however explosive the issue. His formula promised to produce laws satisfactory to all interests. The ultimate goal of these mechanisms were to facilitate the authentic will of the white populace. Calhoun explicitly rejected the founding principles of equality in the Declaration of Independence, denying that humanity is born free and equal in shared nature and basic needs. He regarded this precept as \"the most false and dangerous of all political errors\". States could constitutionally take action to free themselves from an overweening government, but slaves as individuals or interest groups could not do so. Calhoun's stance assumed that with the establishment of a concurrent majority, minority groups would influence their own representatives sufficiently to have a voice in public affairs; the representatives would perform strictly as high-minded public servants. Under this scenario, the political leadership would improve and persist, corruption and demagoguery would subside, and the interests of the people would be honored. This introduces the second theme in the \"Disquisition\", and a counterpoint to his concept of the concurrent majority—political corruption.\n\nCalhoun considered the concurrent majority essential to provide structural restraints to governance, believing that \"a vast majority of mankind is entirely biased by motives of self-interest and that by this interest must be governed\". This innate selfishness would inevitably emerge when government revenue became available to political parties for distribution as patronage. Politicians and bureaucrats would succumb to the lure of government lucre accumulated through taxation, tariff duties and public land sales. Even a diminishment of massive revenue effected through nullification by the permanent minority would not eliminate these temptations. Calhoun predicted that electioneering, political conspiracies, and outright fraud would be employed to mislead and distract a gullible public; inevitably, perfidious demagogues would come to rule the political scene. A decline in authority among the principal statesmen would follow, and, ultimately, the eclipse of the concurrent majority.\n\nCalhoun contended that however confused and misled the masses were by political opportunists, any efforts to impose majority rule upon a minority would be thwarted by a minority veto. What Calhoun fails to explain, according to American historian William W. Freehling, is how a compromise would be achieved in the aftermath of a minority veto, when the ubiquitous demagogues betray their constituencies and abandon the concurrent majority altogether. Calhoun's two key concepts – the maintenance of the concurrent majority by high-minded statesmen on the one hand; and the inevitable rise of demagogues who undermine consensus on the other – are never reconciled or resolved in the \"Disquisition\".\n\nSouth Carolina and other Southern states, in the three decades preceding the Civil War, provided legislatures in which the vested interests of land and slaves dominated in the upper houses, while the popular will of the numerical majority prevailed in the lower houses. There was little opportunity for demagogues to establish themselves in this political milieu – the democratic component among the people was too weak to sustain a plebeian politician. The conservative statesmen – the slaveholding gentry – retained control over the political apparatus. Freehling described the state's political system of the era thus:\n\nJohn C. Calhoun on the \"concurrent majority\" from his Disquisition (1850):\n\nThe \"Disquisition\" was published in 1851, shortly after his death, as was another book, \"Discourse on the Constitution and Government of the United States\".\n\nMany Southerners believed Calhoun's warnings, contained in the \"Disquisition\" and in his many other writings and speeches, and read every political news story from the North as further evidence of the planned destruction of the southern way of life. The climax came a decade after Calhoun's death with the election of Republican Abraham Lincoln in 1860, which led to the secession of South Carolina, followed by six other Southern states. They formed the Confederate States of America.\n\n"}

{"id": "48261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48261", "title": "Ben Jonson", "text": "Ben Jonson\n\nBenjamin Jonson (\"c\". 11 June 1572 – \"c\". 16 August 1637) was an English playwright, poet, actor, and literary critic, whose artistry exerted a lasting impact upon English poetry and stage comedy. He popularised the comedy of humours. He is best known for the satirical plays \"Every Man in His Humour\" (1598), \"Volpone, or The Fox\" (c. 1606), \"The Alchemist\" (1610) and \"Bartholomew Fair\" (1614) and for his lyric and epigrammatic poetry; he is generally regarded as the second most important English playwright during the reign of James VI and I after William Shakespeare.\n\nJonson was a classically educated, well-read and cultured man of the English Renaissance with an appetite for controversy (personal and political, artistic and intellectual) whose cultural influence was of unparalleled breadth upon the playwrights and the poets of the Jacobean era (1603–1625) and of the Caroline era (1625–1642).\n\nIn midlife, Jonson claimed that his paternal grandfather, who 'served King Henry 8 and was a gentleman', was a member of the extended Johnston family of Annandale in the Dumfries and Galloway, a genealogy that is attested by the three spindles (rhombi) in the Jonson family coat of arms: one spindle is a diamond-shaped heraldic device used by the Johnston family. \n\nJonson's father lost his property, was imprisoned, and suffered forfeiture under Queen Mary; having become a clergyman upon his release, he died a month before his son's birth. Jonson's mother married a master bricklayer two years later. Jonson attended school in St Martin's Lane. Later, a family friend paid for his studies at Westminster School, where the antiquarian, historian, topographer and officer of arms, William Camden (1551–1623) was one of his masters. In the event, the pupil and the master became friends, and the intellectual influence of Camden's broad-ranging scholarship upon Jonson's art and literary style remained notable, until Camden's death in 1623.\n\nOn leaving Westminster School, Jonson was to have attended the University of Cambridge, to continue his book learning but did not, because of his unwilled apprenticeship to his bricklayer stepfather. According to the churchman and historian Thomas Fuller (1608–61), Jonson at this time built a garden wall in Lincoln's Inn. After having been an apprentice bricklayer, Ben Jonson went to the Netherlands and volunteered to soldier with the English regiments of Francis Vere (1560–1609) in Flanders.\n\nThe \"Hawthornden Manuscripts\" (1619), of the conversations between Ben Jonson and the poet William Drummond of Hawthornden (1585–1649), report that, when in Flanders, Jonson engaged, fought and killed an enemy soldier in single combat, and took for trophies the weapons of the vanquished soldier. After his military activity on the Continent, Jonson returned to England and worked as an actor and as a playwright. As an actor, Jonson was the protagonist “Hieronimo” (Geronimo) in the play \"The Spanish Tragedy\" (ca. 1586), by Thomas Kyd (1558–94), the first revenge tragedy in English literature. Moreover, by 1597, he was a working playwright employed by Philip Henslowe, the leading producer for the English public theatre; by the next year, the production of \"Every Man in His Humour\" (1598) had established Jonson's reputation as a dramatist.\n\nRegarding his marriage Jonson described his wife to William Drummond as \"a shrew, yet honest\". The identity of Jonson's wife has always been obscure, yet she sometimes is identified as \"Ann Lewis\", the woman who married a Benjamin Jonson in 1594, at the church of St Magnus-the-Martyr, near London Bridge. Concerning the family of Anne Lewis and Ben Jonson, the St. Martin's Church registers indicate that Mary Jonson, their eldest daughter, died in November 1593, at six months of age. Then a decade later, in 1603, Benjamin Jonson, their eldest son, died of Bubonic plague when he was seven years old; to lament and honour the dead boy, Benjamin Jonson \"père\" wrote the elegiac \"On My First Sonne\" (1603). Moreover, 32 years later, a second son, also named Benjamin Jonson, died in 1635. In that period, Ann Lewis and Ben Jonson lived separate lives for five years; their matrimonial arrangement cast Ann Lewis as the housewife Jonson, and Ben Jonson as the artist who enjoyed the residential hospitality of his patrons, Sir Robert Townshend and Lord Aubigny, Esme Stuart, 3rd Duke of Lennox.\n\nBy summer 1597, Jonson had a fixed engagement in the Admiral's Men, then performing under Philip Henslowe's management at The Rose. John Aubrey reports, on uncertain authority, that Jonson was not successful as an actor; whatever his skills as an actor, he was evidently more valuable to the company as a writer.\n\nBy this time Jonson had begun to write original plays for the Admiral's Men; in 1598 he was mentioned by Francis Meres in his \"Palladis Tamia\" as one of \"the best for tragedy.\" None of his early tragedies survive, however. An undated comedy, \"The Case is Altered\", may be his earliest surviving play.\n\nIn 1597 a play which he co-wrote with Thomas Nashe, \"The Isle of Dogs\", was suppressed after causing great offence. Arrest warrants for Jonson and Nashe were issued by Queen Elizabeth I's so-called interrogator, Richard Topcliffe. Jonson was jailed in Marshalsea Prison and charged with \"Leude and mutynous behaviour\", while Nashe managed to escape to Great Yarmouth. Two of the actors, Gabriel Spenser and Robert Shaw, were also imprisoned. A year later, Jonson was again briefly imprisoned, this time in Newgate Prison, for killing Gabriel Spenser in a duel on 22 September 1598 in Hogsden Fields (today part of Hoxton). Tried on a charge of manslaughter, Jonson pleaded guilty but was released by benefit of clergy, a legal ploy through which he gained leniency by reciting a brief bible verse (the neck-verse), forfeiting his 'goods and chattels' and being branded on his left thumb. While in jail Jonson converted to Catholicism, possibly through the influence of fellow-prisoner Father Thomas Wright, a Jesuit priest.\n\nIn 1598 Jonson produced his first great success, \"Every Man in His Humour\", capitalising on the vogue for humorous plays which George Chapman had begun with \"An Humorous Day's Mirth\". William Shakespeare was among the first actors to be cast. Jonson followed this in 1599 with \"Every Man out of His Humour\", a pedantic attempt to imitate Aristophanes. It is not known whether this was a success on stage, but when published it proved popular and went through several editions.\n\nJonson's other work for the theatre in the last years of Elizabeth I's reign was marked by fighting and controversy. \"Cynthia's Revels\" was produced by the Children of the Chapel Royal at Blackfriars Theatre in 1600. It satirised both John Marston, who Jonson believed had accused him of lustfulness in \"Histriomastix\", and Thomas Dekker. Jonson attacked the two poets again in \"Poetaster\" (1601). Dekker responded with \"Satiromastix\", subtitled \"the untrussing of the humorous poet\". The final scene of this play, whilst certainly not to be taken at face value as a portrait of Jonson, offers a caricature that is recognisable from Drummond's report – boasting about himself and condemning other poets, criticising performances of his plays and calling attention to himself in any available way.\n\nThis \"War of the Theatres\" appears to have ended with reconciliation on all sides. Jonson collaborated with Dekker on a pageant welcoming James I to England in 1603 although Drummond reports that Jonson called Dekker a rogue. Marston dedicated \"The Malcontent\" to Jonson and the two collaborated with Chapman on \"Eastward Ho\", a 1605 play whose anti-Scottish sentiment briefly landed both Jonson and Chapman in jail.\n\nAt the beginning of the English reign of James VI and I in 1603 Jonson joined other poets and playwrights in welcoming the new king. Jonson quickly adapted himself to the additional demand for masques and entertainments introduced with the new reign and fostered by both the king and his consort Anne of Denmark. In addition to his popularity on the public stage and in the royal hall, he enjoyed the patronage of aristocrats such as Elizabeth Sidney (daughter of Sir Philip Sidney) and Lady Mary Wroth. This connection with the Sidney family provided the impetus for one of Jonson's most famous lyrics, the country house poem \"To Penshurst\".\n\nIn February 1603 John Manningham reported that Jonson was living on Robert Townsend, son of Sir Roger Townshend, and \"scorns the world.\" Perhaps this explains why his trouble with English authorities continued. That same year he was questioned by the Privy Council about \"Sejanus\", a politically themed play about corruption in the Roman Empire. He was again in trouble for topical allusions in a play, now lost, in which he took part. Shortly after his release from a brief spell of imprisonment imposed to mark the authorities' displeasure at the work, in the second week of October 1605, he was present at a supper party attended by most of the Gunpowder Plot conspirators. After the plot's discovery he appears to have avoided further imprisonment; he volunteered what he knew of the affair to the investigator Robert Cecil and the Privy Council. Father Thomas Wright, who heard Fawkes's confession, was known to Jonson from prison in 1598 and Cecil may have directed him to bring the priest before the council, as a witness. (Teague, 249).\n\nAt the same time, Jonson pursued a more prestigious career, writing masques for James's court. \"The Satyr\" (1603) and \"The Masque of Blackness\" (1605) are two of about two dozen masques which Jonson wrote for James or for Queen Anne, some of them performed at Apethorpe Palace when the King was in residence. \"The Masque of Blackness\" was praised by Algernon Charles Swinburne as the consummate example of this now-extinct genre, which mingled speech, dancing and spectacle.\n\nOn many of these projects he collaborated, not always peacefully, with designer Inigo Jones. For example, Jones designed the scenery for Jonson's masque \"Oberon, the Faery Prince\" performed at Whitehall on 1 January 1611 in which Prince Henry, eldest son of James I, appeared in the title role. Perhaps partly as a result of this new career, Jonson gave up writing plays for the public theatres for a decade. He later told Drummond that he had made less than two hundred pounds on all his plays together.\n\nIn 1616 Jonson received a yearly pension of 100 marks (about £60), leading some to identify him as England's first Poet Laureate. This sign of royal favour may have encouraged him to publish the first volume of the folio collected edition of his works that year. Other volumes followed in 1640–41 and 1692. (See: Ben Jonson folios)\n\nOn 8 July 1618 Jonson set out from Bishopsgate in London to walk to Edinburgh, arriving in Scotland's capital on 17 September. For the most part he followed the great north road, and was treated to lavish and enthusiastic welcomes in both towns and country houses. On his arrival he lodged initially with John Stuart, a cousin of King James, in Leith, and was made an honorary burgess of Edinburgh at a dinner laid on by the city on 26 September. He stayed in Scotland until late January 1619, and the best-remembered hospitality he enjoyed was that of the Scottish poet, William Drummond of Hawthornden, sited on the River Esk. Drummond undertook to record as much of Jonson's conversation as he could in his diary, and thus recorded aspects of Jonson's personality that would otherwise have been less clearly seen. Jonson delivers his opinions, in Drummond's terse reporting, in an expansive and even magisterial mood. Drummond noted he was \"a great lover and praiser of himself, a contemner and scorner of others\".\n\nOn returning to England, he was awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree from Oxford University.\n\nThe period between 1605 and 1620 may be viewed as Jonson's heyday. By 1616 he had produced all the plays on which his present reputation as a dramatist is based, including the tragedy \"Catiline\" (acted and printed 1611), which achieved limited success and the comedies \"Volpone\" (acted 1605 and printed in 1607), \"Epicoene, or the Silent Woman\" (1609), \"The Alchemist\" (1610), \"\" (1614) and \"The Devil is an Ass\" (1616). \"The Alchemist\" and \"Volpone\" were immediately successful. Of \"Epicoene\", Jonson told Drummond of a satirical verse which reported that the play's subtitle was appropriate, since its audience had refused to applaud the play (i.e., remained silent). Yet \"Epicoene\", along with \"Bartholomew Fair\" and (to a lesser extent) \"The Devil is an Ass\" have in modern times achieved a certain degree of recognition. While his life during this period was apparently more settled than it had been in the 1590s, his financial security was still not assured.\n\nJonson recounted that his father had been a prosperous Protestant landowner until the reign of \"Bloody Mary\" and had suffered imprisonment and the forfeiture of his wealth during that monarch's attempt to restore England to Catholicism. On Elizabeth's accession he was freed and was able to travel to London to become a clergyman. (All that's known of Jonson's father, who died a month before his son was born, comes from the poet's own narrative.) Jonson's elementary education was in a small church school attached to St Martin-in-the-Fields parish, and at the age of about seven he secured a place at Westminster School, then part of Westminster Abbey.\n\nNotwithstanding this emphatically Protestant grounding, Jonson maintained an interest in Catholic doctrine throughout his adult life and, at a particularly perilous time while a religious war with Spain was widely expected and persecution of Catholics was intensifying, he converted to the faith. This took place in October 1598, while Jonson was on remand in Newgate Gaol charged with manslaughter. Jonson's biographer Ian Donaldson is among those who suggest that the conversion was instigated by Father Thomas Wright, a Jesuit priest who had resigned from the order over his acceptance of Queen Elizabeth's right to rule in England. Wright, although placed under house arrest on the orders of Lord Burghley, was permitted to minister to the inmates of London prisons. It may have been that Jonson, fearing that his trial would go against him, was seeking the unequivocal absolution that Catholicism could offer if he were sentenced to death. Alternatively, he could have been looking to personal advantage from accepting conversion since Father Wright's protector, the Earl of Essex, was among those who might hope to rise to influence after the succession of a new monarch. Jonson's conversion came at a weighty time in affairs of state; the royal succession, from the childless Elizabeth, had not been settled and Essex's Catholic allies were hopeful that a sympathetic ruler might attain the throne.\n\nConviction, and certainly not expedience alone, sustained Jonson's faith during the troublesome twelve years he remained a Catholic. His stance received attention beyond the low-level intolerance to which most followers of that faith were exposed. The first draft of his play \"Sejanus\" was banned for \"popery\", and did not re-appear until some offending passages were cut. In January 1606 he (with Anne, his wife) appeared before the Consistory Court in London to answer a charge of recusancy, with Jonson alone additionally accused of allowing his fame as a Catholic to \"seduce\" citizens to the cause. This was a serious matter (the Gunpowder Plot was still fresh in mind) but he explained that his failure to take communion was only because he had not found sound theological endorsement for the practice, and by paying a fine of thirteen shillings (65p) he escaped the more serious penalties at the authorities' disposal. His habit was to slip outside during the sacrament, a common routine at the time—indeed it was one followed by the royal consort, Queen Anne, herself—to show political loyalty while not offending the conscience. Leading church figures, including John Overall, Dean of St Paul's, were tasked with winning Jonson back to Protestantism, but these overtures were resisted.\n\nIn May 1610 Henry IV of France was assassinated, purportedly in the name of the Pope; he had been a Catholic monarch respected in England for tolerance towards Protestants, and his murder seems to have been the immediate cause of Jonson's decision to rejoin the Church of England. He did this in flamboyant style, pointedly drinking a full chalice of communion wine at the eucharist to demonstrate his renunciation of the Catholic rite, in which the priest alone drinks the wine. The exact date of the ceremony is unknown. However, his interest in Catholic belief and practice remained with him until his death.\n\nJonson's productivity began to decline in the 1620s, but he remained well known. In that time, rose to the prominence the Sons of Ben or the \"Tribe of Ben\" - those younger poets such as Robert Herrick, Richard Lovelace, and Sir John Suckling who took their bearing in verse from Jonson. However, a series of setbacks drained his strength and damaged his reputation. He resumed writing regular plays in the 1620s, but these are not considered among his best. They are of significant interest, however, for their portrayal of Charles I's England. \"The Staple of News\", for example, offers a remarkable look at the earliest stage of English journalism. The lukewarm reception given that play was, however, nothing compared to the dismal failure of \"The New Inn\"; the cold reception given this play prompted Jonson to write a poem condemning his audience (the \"Ode to Myself\"), which in turn prompted Thomas Carew, one of the \"Tribe of Ben,\" to respond in a poem that asks Jonson to recognise his own decline.\n\nThe principal factor in Jonson's partial eclipse was, however, the death of James and the accession of King Charles I in 1625. Jonson felt neglected by the new court. A decisive quarrel with Jones harmed his career as a writer of court masques, although he continued to entertain the court on an irregular basis. For his part, Charles displayed a certain degree of care for the great poet of his father's day: he increased Jonson's annual pension to £100 and included a tierce of wine and beer.\n\nDespite the strokes that he suffered in the 1620s, Jonson continued to write. At his death in 1637 he seems to have been working on another play, \"The Sad Shepherd\". Though only two acts are extant, this represents a remarkable new direction for Jonson: a move into pastoral drama. During the early 1630s he also conducted a correspondence with James Howell, who warned him about disfavour at court in the wake of his dispute with Jones.\n\nJonson died on or around 16 August 1637, and his funeral was held the next day. It was attended by 'all or the greatest part of the nobility then in town'. He is buried in the north aisle of the nave in Westminster Abbey, with the inscription \"O Rare Ben Johnson \"[sic]\"\" set in the slab over his grave. John Aubrey, in a more meticulous record than usual, notes that a passer-by, John Young of Great Milton, Oxfordshire, saw the bare grave marker and on impulse paid a workman eighteen pence to make the inscription. Another theory suggests that the tribute came from William Davenant, Jonson's successor as Poet Laureate (and card-playing companion of Young), as the same phrase appears on Davenant's nearby gravestone, but essayist Leigh Hunt contends that Davenant's wording represented no more than Young's coinage, cheaply re-used. The fact that Jonson was buried in an upright position was an indication of his reduced circumstances at the time of his death, although it has also been written that he asked for a grave exactly 18 inches square from the monarch and received an upright grave to fit in the requested space.\n\nIt has been claimed that the inscription could be read \"Orare Ben Jonson\" (pray for Ben Jonson), possibly in an allusion to Jonson's acceptance of Catholic doctrine during his lifetime (although he had returned to the Church of England) but the carving shows a distinct space between \"O\" and \"rare\".\n\nA monument to Jonson was erected in about 1723 by the Earl of Oxford and is in the eastern aisle of Westminster Abbey's Poets' Corner. It includes a portrait medallion and the same inscription as on the gravestone. It seems Jonson was to have had a monument erected by subscription soon after his death but the English Civil War intervened.\n\nApart from two tragedies, \"Sejanus\" and \"\", that largely failed to impress Renaissance audiences, Jonson's work for the public theatres was in comedy. These plays vary in some respects. The minor early plays, particularly those written for boy players, present somewhat looser plots and less-developed characters than those written later, for adult companies. Already in the plays which were his salvos in the Poet's War, he displays the keen eye for absurdity and hypocrisy that marks his best-known plays; in these early efforts, however, plot mostly takes second place to variety of incident and comic set-pieces. They are, also, notably ill-tempered. Thomas Davies called \"Poetaster\" \"a contemptible mixture of the serio-comic, where the names of Augustus Caesar, Maecenas, Virgil, Horace, Ovid and Tibullus, are all sacrificed upon the altar of private resentment.\" Another early comedy in a different vein, \"The Case is Altered\", is markedly similar to Shakespeare's romantic comedies in its foreign setting, emphasis on genial wit and love-plot. Henslowe's diary indicates that Jonson had a hand in numerous other plays, including many in genres such as English history with which he is not otherwise associated.\n\nThe comedies of his middle career, from \"Eastward Ho\" to \"The Devil is an Ass\" are for the most part city comedy, with a London setting, themes of trickery and money, and a distinct moral ambiguity, despite Jonson's professed aim in the Prologue to \"Volpone\" to \"mix profit with your pleasure\". His late plays or \"dotages\", particularly \"The Magnetic Lady\" and \"The Sad Shepherd\", exhibit signs of an accommodation with the romantic tendencies of Elizabethan comedy.\n\nWithin this general progression, however, Jonson's comic style remained constant and easily recognisable. He announces his programme in the prologue to the folio version of \"Every Man in His Humour\": he promises to represent \"deeds, and language, such as men do use.\" He planned to write comedies that revived the classical premises of Elizabethan dramatic theory—or rather, since all but the loosest English comedies could claim some descent from Plautus and Terence, he intended to apply those premises with rigour. This commitment entailed negations: after \"The Case is Altered\", Jonson eschewed distant locations, noble characters, romantic plots and other staples of Elizabethan comedy, focusing instead on the satiric and realistic inheritance of new comedy. He set his plays in contemporary settings, peopled them with recognisable types, and set them to actions that, if not strictly realistic, involved everyday motives such as greed and jealousy. In accordance with the temper of his age, he was often so broad in his characterisation that many of his most famous scenes border on the farcical (as William Congreve, for example, judged \"Epicoene\".) He was more diligent in adhering to the classical unities than many of his peers—although as Margaret Cavendish noted, the unity of action in the major comedies was rather compromised by Jonson's abundance of incident. To this classical model Jonson applied the two features of his style which save his classical imitations from mere pedantry: the vividness with which he depicted the lives of his characters, and the intricacy of his plots. Coleridge, for instance, claimed that \"The Alchemist\" had one of the three most perfect plots in literature.\n\nJonson's poetry, like his drama, is informed by his classical learning. Some of his better-known poems are close translations of Greek or Roman models; all display the careful attention to form and style that often came naturally to those trained in classics in the humanist manner. Jonson largely avoided the debates about rhyme and meter that had consumed Elizabethan classicists such as Thomas Campion and Gabriel Harvey. Accepting both rhyme and stress, Jonson used them to mimic the classical qualities of simplicity, restraint and precision.\n\n\"Epigrams\" (published in the 1616 folio) is an entry in a genre that was popular among late-Elizabethan and Jacobean audiences, although Jonson was perhaps the only poet of his time to work in its full classical range. The epigrams explore various attitudes, most from the satiric stock of the day: complaints against women, courtiers and spies abound. The condemnatory poems are short and anonymous; Jonson’s epigrams of praise, including a famous poem to Camden and lines to Lucy Harington, are longer and are mostly addressed to specific individuals. Although it is included among the epigrams, \"On My First Sonne\" is neither satirical nor very short; the poem, intensely personal and deeply felt, typifies a genre that would come to be called \"lyric poetry.\" It is possible that the spelling of 'son' as 'Sonne' is meant to allude to the sonnet form, with which it shares some features. A few other so-called epigrams share this quality. Jonson's poems of \"The Forest\" also appeared in the first folio. Most of the fifteen poems are addressed to Jonson's aristocratic supporters, but the most famous are his country-house poem “To Penshurst” and the poem “To Celia” (\"Come, my Celia, let us prove\") that appears also in \"Volpone\".\n\n\"Underwood\", published in the expanded folio of 1640, is a larger and more heterogeneous group of poems. It contains \"A Celebration of Charis\", Jonson's most extended effort at love poetry; various religious pieces; encomiastic poems including the poem to Shakespeare and a sonnet on Mary Wroth; the \"Execration against Vulcan\" and others. The 1640 volume also contains three elegies which have often been ascribed to Donne (one of them appeared in Donne's posthumous collected poems).\n\nThere are many legends about Jonson's rivalry with Shakespeare, some of which may be true. Drummond reports that during their conversation, Jonson scoffed at two apparent absurdities in Shakespeare's plays: a nonsensical line in \"Julius Caesar\", and the setting of \"The Winter's Tale\" on the non-existent seacoast of Bohemia. Drummond also reported Jonson as saying that Shakespeare \"wanted art\" (i.e., lacked skill). Whether Drummond is viewed as accurate or not, the comments fit well with Jonson's well-known theories about literature.\n\nIn in \"Timber\", which was published posthumously and reflects his lifetime of practical experience, Jonson offers a fuller and more conciliatory comment. He recalls being told by certain actors that Shakespeare never blotted (i.e., crossed out) a line when he wrote. His own claimed response was \"Would he had blotted a thousand!\" However, Jonson explains, \"He was, indeed, honest and of an open and free nature, had an excellent phantasy, brave notions and gentle expressions, wherein he flowed with that facility that sometimes it was necessary he should be stopped\". Jonson concludes that \"there was ever more in him to be praised than to be pardoned.\" Also when Shakespeare died, he said, \"He was not of an age, but for all time.\"\n\nThomas Fuller relates stories of Jonson and Shakespeare engaging in debates in the Mermaid Tavern; Fuller imagines conversations in which Shakespeare would run rings around the more learned but more ponderous Jonson. That the two men knew each other personally is beyond doubt, not only because of the tone of Jonson's references to him but because Shakespeare's company produced a number of Jonson's plays, at least two of which (\"Every Man in His Humour\" and \"Sejanus His Fall\") Shakespeare certainly acted in. However, it is now impossible to tell how much personal communication they had, and tales of their friendship cannot be substantiated.\n\nJonson's most influential and revealing commentary on Shakespeare is the second of the two poems that he contributed to the prefatory verse that opens Shakespeare's First Folio. This poem, , did a good deal to create the traditional view of Shakespeare as a poet who, despite \"small Latine, and lesse Greeke\", had a natural genius. The poem has traditionally been thought to exemplify the contrast which Jonson perceived between himself, the disciplined and erudite classicist, scornful of ignorance and sceptical of the masses, and Shakespeare, represented in the poem as a kind of natural wonder whose genius was not subject to any rules except those of the audiences for which he wrote. But the poem itself qualifies this view:\n\nSome view this elegy as a conventional exercise, but others see it as a heartfelt tribute to the \"Sweet Swan of Avon\", the \"Soul of the Age!\" It has been argued that Jonson helped to edit the First Folio, and he may have been inspired to write this poem by reading his fellow playwright's works, a number of which had been previously either unpublished or available in less satisfactory versions, in a relatively complete form.\n\nJonson was a towering literary figure, and his influence was enormous for he has been described as 'One of the most vigorous minds that ever added to the strength of English literature'. Before the English Civil War, the \"Tribe of Ben\" touted his importance, and during the Restoration Jonson's satirical comedies and his theory and practice of \"humour characters\" (which are often misunderstood; see William Congreve's letters for clarification) was extremely influential, providing the blueprint for many Restoration comedies. John Aubrey wrote of Jonson in \"Brief Lives.\" By 1700 Jonson's status began to decline. In the Romantic era, Jonson suffered the fate of being unfairly compared and contrasted to Shakespeare, as the taste for Jonson's type of satirical comedy decreased. Jonson was at times greatly appreciated by the Romantics, but overall he was denigrated for not writing in a Shakespearean vein.\n\nIn 2012, after more than two decades of research, Cambridge University Press published the first new edition of Jonson's complete works for 60 years.\n\nAs G. E. Bentley notes in \"Shakespeare and Jonson: Their Reputations in the Seventeenth Century Compared\", Jonson's reputation was in some respects equal to Shakespeare's in the 17th century. After the English theatres were reopened on the Restoration of Charles II, Jonson's work, along with Shakespeare's and Fletcher's, formed the initial core of the Restoration repertory. It was not until after 1710 that Shakespeare's plays (ordinarily in heavily revised forms) were more frequently performed than those of his Renaissance contemporaries. Many critics since the 18th century have ranked Jonson below only Shakespeare among English Renaissance dramatists. Critical judgment has tended to emphasise the very qualities that Jonson himself lauds in his prefaces, in \"Timber\", and in his scattered prefaces and dedications: the realism and propriety of his language, the bite of his satire, and the care with which he plotted his comedies.\n\nFor some critics, the temptation to contrast Jonson (representing art or craft) with Shakespeare (representing nature, or untutored genius) has seemed natural; Jonson himself may be said to have initiated this interpretation in the second folio, and Samuel Butler drew the same comparison in his commonplace book later in the century.\n\nAt the Restoration, this sensed difference became a kind of critical dogma. Charles de Saint-Évremond placed Jonson's comedies above all else in English drama, and Charles Gildon called Jonson the father of English comedy. John Dryden offered a more common assessment in the \"Essay of Dramatic Poesie,\" in which his Avatar Neander compares Shakespeare to Homer and Jonson to Virgil: the former represented profound creativity, the latter polished artifice. But \"artifice\" was in the 17th century almost synonymous with \"art\"; Jonson, for instance, used \"artificer\" as a synonym for \"artist\" (\"Discoveries,\" 33). For Lewis Theobald, too, Jonson \"ow[ed] all his Excellence to his Art,” in contrast to Shakespeare, the natural genius. Nicholas Rowe, to whom may be traced the legend that Jonson owed the production of \"Every Man in his Humour\" to Shakespeare's intercession, likewise attributed Jonson's excellence to learning, which did not raise him quite to the level of genius. A consensus formed: Jonson was the first English poet to understand classical precepts with any accuracy, and he was the first to apply those precepts successfully to contemporary life. But there were also more negative spins on Jonson's learned art; for instance, in the 1750s, Edward Young casually remarked on the way in which Jonson's learning worked, like Samson's strength, to his own detriment. Earlier, Aphra Behn, writing in defence of female playwrights, had pointed to Jonson as a writer whose learning did not make him popular; unsurprisingly, she compares him unfavourably to Shakespeare. Particularly in the tragedies, with their lengthy speeches abstracted from Sallust and Cicero, Augustan critics saw a writer whose learning had swamped his aesthetic judgment.\n\nIn this period, Alexander Pope is exceptional in that he noted the tendency to exaggeration in these competing critical portraits: \"It is ever the nature of Parties to be in extremes; and nothing is so probable, as that because Ben Johnson had much the most learning, it was said on the one hand that Shakespear had none at all; and because Shakespear had much the most wit and fancy, it was retorted on the other, that Johnson wanted both.\" For the most part, the 18th century consensus remained committed to the division that Pope doubted; as late as the 1750s, Sarah Fielding could put a brief recapitulation of this analysis in the mouth of a \"man of sense\" encountered by David Simple.\n\nThough his stature declined during the 18th century, Jonson was still read and commented on throughout the century, generally in the kind of comparative and dismissive terms just described. Heinrich Wilhelm von Gerstenberg translated parts of Peter Whalley's edition into German in 1765. Shortly before the Romantic revolution, Edward Capell offered an almost unqualified rejection of Jonson as a dramatic poet, who (he writes) \"has very poor pretensions to the high place he holds among the English Bards, as there is no original manner to distinguish him and the tedious sameness visible in his plots indicates a defect of Genius.\" The disastrous failures of productions of \"Volpone\" and \"Epicoene\" in the early 1770s no doubt bolstered a widespread sense that Jonson had at last grown too antiquated for the contemporary public; if he still attracted enthusiasts such as Earl Camden and William Gifford, he all but disappeared from the stage in the last quarter of the century.\n\nThe romantic revolution in criticism brought about an overall decline in the critical estimation of Jonson. Hazlitt refers dismissively to Jonson's \"laborious caution.\" Coleridge, while more respectful, describes Jonson as psychologically superficial: “He was a very accurately observing man; but he cared only to observe what was open to, and likely to impress, the senses.” Coleridge placed Jonson second only to Shakespeare; other romantic critics were less approving. The early 19th century was the great age for recovering Renaissance drama. Jonson, whose reputation had survived, appears to have been less interesting to some readers than writers such as Thomas Middleton or John Heywood, who were in some senses \"discoveries\" of the 19th century. Moreover, the emphasis which the romantic writers placed on imagination, and their concomitant tendency to distrust studied art, lowered Jonson's status, if it also sharpened their awareness of the difference traditionally noted between Jonson and Shakespeare. This trend was by no means universal, however; William Gifford, Jonson's first editor of the 19th century, did a great deal to defend Jonson's reputation during this period of general decline. In the next era, Swinburne, who was more interested in Jonson than most Victorians, wrote, \"The flowers of his growing have every quality but one which belongs to the rarest and finest among flowers: they have colour, form, variety, fertility, vigour: the one thing they want is fragrance” – by “fragrance,” Swinburne means spontaneity.\n\nIn the 20th century, Jonson’s body of work has been subject to a more varied set of analyses, broadly consistent with the interests and programmes of modern literary criticism. In an essay printed in \"The Sacred Wood\", T. S. Eliot attempted to repudiate the charge that Jonson was an arid classicist by analysing the role of imagination in his dialogue. Eliot was appreciative of Jonson's overall conception and his \"surface\", a view consonant with the modernist reaction against Romantic criticism, which tended to denigrate playwrights who did not concentrate on representations of psychological depth. Around mid-century, a number of critics and scholars followed Eliot's lead, producing detailed studies of Jonson's verbal style. At the same time, study of Elizabethan themes and conventions, such as those by E. E. Stoll and M. C. Bradbrook, provided a more vivid sense of how Jonson's work was shaped by the expectations of his time.\n\nThe proliferation of new critical perspectives after mid-century touched on Jonson inconsistently. Jonas Barish was the leading figure among critics who appreciated Jonson's artistry. On the other hand, Jonson received less attention from the new critics than did some other playwrights and his work was not of programmatic interest to psychoanalytic critics. But Jonson's career eventually made him a focal point for the revived sociopolitical criticism. Jonson's works, particularly his masques and pageants, offer significant information regarding the relations of literary production and political power, as do his contacts with and poems for aristocratic patrons; moreover, his career at the centre of London's emerging literary world has been seen as exemplifying the development of a fully commodified literary culture. In this respect he is seen as a transitional figure, an author whose skills and ambition led him to a leading role both in the declining culture of patronage and in the rising culture of mass consumption.\n\nJonson has been called 'the first poet laureate'. If Jonson's reputation as a playwright has traditionally been linked to Shakespeare, his reputation as a poet has, since the early 20th century, been linked to that of John Donne. In this comparison, Jonson represents the cavalier strain of poetry, emphasising grace and clarity of expression; Donne, by contrast, epitomised the metaphysical school of poetry, with its reliance on strained, baroque metaphors and often vague phrasing. Since the critics who made this comparison (Herbert Grierson for example), were to varying extents rediscovering Donne, this comparison often worked to the detriment of Jonson's reputation.\n\nIn his time Jonson was at least as influential as Donne. In 1623, historian Edmund Bolton named him the best and most polished English poet. That this judgment was widely shared is indicated by the admitted influence he had on younger poets. The grounds for describing Jonson as the \"father\" of cavalier poets are clear: many of the cavalier poets described themselves as his \"sons\" or his \"tribe\". For some of this tribe, the connection was as much social as poetic; Herrick described meetings at \"the Sun, the Dog, the Triple Tunne\". All of them, including those like Herrick whose accomplishments in verse are generally regarded as superior to Jonson's, took inspiration from Jonson's revival of classical forms and themes, his subtle melodies, and his disciplined use of wit. In these respects Jonson may be regarded as among the most important figures in the prehistory of English neoclassicism.\n\nThe best of Jonson's lyrics have remained current since his time; periodically, they experience a brief vogue, as after the publication of Peter Whalley's edition of 1756. Jonson's poetry continues to interest scholars for the light which it sheds on English literary history, such as politics, systems of patronage and intellectual attitudes. For the general reader, Jonson's reputation rests on a few lyrics that, though brief, are surpassed for grace and precision by very few Renaissance poems: \"On My First Sonne\"; \"To Celia\"; \"To Penshurst\"; and the epitaph on Salomon Pavy, a boy player abducted from his parents who acted in Jonson's plays.\n\n\n\n\nIt is in Jonson's \"Timber, or Discoveries...\" that he famously quipped on the manner in which language became a measure of the speaker or writer:\n\nAs with other English Renaissance dramatists, a portion of Ben Jonson's literary output has not survived. In addition to \"The Isle of Dogs\" (1597), the records suggest these lost plays as wholly or partially Jonson's work: \"Richard Crookback\" (1602); \"Hot Anger Soon Cold\" (1598), with Porter and Henry Chettle; \"Page of Plymouth\" (1599), with Dekker; and \"Robert II, King of Scots\" (1599), with Chettle and Dekker. Several of Jonson's masques and entertainments also are not extant: \"The Entertainment at Merchant Taylors\" (1607); \"The Entertainment at Salisbury House for James I\" (1608); and \"The May Lord\" (1613–19).\n\nFinally, there are questionable or borderline attributions. Jonson may have had a hand in \"Rollo, Duke of Normandy, or The Bloody Brother\", a play in the canon of John Fletcher and his collaborators. The comedy \"The Widow\" was printed in 1652 as the work of Thomas Middleton, Fletcher and Jonson, though scholars have been intensely sceptical about Jonson's presence in the play. A few attributions of anonymous plays, such as \"The London Prodigal\", have been ventured by individual researchers, but have met with cool responses.\n\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "40053022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40053022", "title": "Contemporary Ukrainian literature", "text": "Contemporary Ukrainian literature\n\nContemporary Ukrainian literature is a notion referred to Ukrainian literature of the past several decades. Most often 1991 as a year of Ukrainian independence is considered as a start of the contemporary Ukrainian literature as from that year on the literary censorship of the Soviet Union ceased to exist and writers were able to deviate from the official socialist realism style. Principal changes took place in Ukrainian literature already in the years of Perestroika (1985) and especially after the Chernobyl disaster. Some researchers consider that contemporary Ukrainian literature started from the 1970-s after the generation of the sixtiers.\n\nDue to the increased freedom and openness of the Ukrainian society to foreign influences and much broader contacts with literatures of other countries contemporary Ukrainian literature is different from the literature of soviet and classical period. It turns to the previously forbidden topics (Holodomor, sexuality, drugs, deviant behavior, etc.), using new styles (postmodernism, neo avant-garde, profanity and surzhyk), diversity and mixing of genres, shocking effects and reflecting upon social problems and historical memory.\n\nModern Ukraine also has a significant number of Russophone writers, who are especially successful in the genres of science fiction and fantasy.\n\nDuring the later USSR some Ukrainian writers started to deviate from the officially approved literary style of socialist realism. Among these writers were Valeriy Shevchuk with his psychological prose and the authors of \"chymeric prose\" (Vasyl Zemlyak and Volodymyr Drozd) similar to magical realism. There existed also underground literary circles like the Kyiv school of poetry (Vasyl Holoborodko, Mykola Vorobyov, Viktor Kordun, Mykhaylo Hryhoriv), a circle of Lviv writers around the samizdat \"Skrynya\" almanac (Hryhoriy Chubay, Oleh Lysheha, Mykola Riabchuk, Viktor Morozov, Roman Kis, Orest Yavorskyi), separate dissident writers like Ihor Kalynets. Authors belonging to \"Kyiv ironic school\" (Volodymr Dibrova, Bohdan Zholdak, Les Podervianskyi) are considered to be the forefathers of Ukrainian postmodernism. Contemporary Ukrainian literature was also influenced by the \"New York group\" of Ukraininan emigre writers, who separated politics from their art in contrast to the politically active sixtiers writers in soviet Ukraine. On the background of stronger censorship and repression in the times of Brezhnev many writers in Ukraine since 1970-s distanced themselves into inner immigration making their literature self-sufficient.\n\nWith advent of Perestroika the censorship pressure on writers decreased. This allowed them to turn to previously prohibited styles and themes. The populist canon of social realism was revised, the works of the \"Shot renaissance\" modernist generation of 1920-s, diaspora and underground writers were printed.\n\nThe role of a writer in the society was revised. A writer in soviet Ukraine played a specially important social function, which new postmodernist writers (especially the Bu-Ba-Bu group of poets including Yuri Andrukhovych, Viktor Neborak and Oleksandr Irvanets) tried to debunk.\n\nSome of the centers of new Ukrainian literature were situated away from the republican capital of Kyiv. \"Stanislav phenomenon\" emerged in Ivano-Frankivsk and included a group of eminent writers like Yuri Andrukhovych, Yuriy Izdryk, Taras Prokhasko, Halyna Petrosanyak and Mariya Makytsey.\n\nMykola Riabchuk was an influential figure in Ukrainian literature in the end of 1980-s and beginning of 1990-s. He edited \"Suchasnist\", the most influential literary journal at that period. Thanks to Riabchuk many still to become famous writers were first published.\n\nAfter the collapse of the USSR Ukraine faced a decade of substantial social changes. A free book marked had to replace the state-financed soviet publishing system and the support of writers loyal to the regime.\n\nModernist tradition in Ukrainian literature was raptured by extermination of many Ukraininan writers in 1930-es. A Soviet period of considerable cultural isolation followed. This led to the fact some contemporary Ukrainian authors write in classical, modernist or postmodernist styles coming in terms with the historic gap each on their own terms.\n\nMany works of contemporary writers are concentrated on darker sides of human life, violence and crisis. This came about as a reaction to the false and compulsory optimism of the official socialist realist literature.\n\nThere are numerous literary festivals in Ukraine, most important are the Lviv international literary festival, Meridian Czernowitz and Kyivski lavry.\n\nSome Ukrainian authors write in a mixture of Ukrainian and Russian called surzhyk (Bohdan Zholdak, Les Podervianskyi, Volodymyr Dibrova, Myhaylo Brynyh) using it to create a comic effect as this is the language of the marginalized.\n\nA number of writers of Ukraine write in Russian language. Andriy Kurkov is the best known of them. Also a great number of contemporary Russian science fiction writers originally come from Ukraine or still live there (H. L. Oldie, Alexander Zorich, Yuri Nikitin, Andrey Valentinov, Marina and Sergey Dyachenko and Vladimir Arenev).\n\nAmong the well-known Ukrainian poets are Yuri Andrukhovych, Les Beley, Andriy Bondar, Vasyl Herasymyuk, Vasyl Holoborodko, \nMariyanna Kiyanovska, Pavlo Korobchuk, Oleh Kotsarev, Halyna Kruk, Dmytro Lazutkin, Oleh Lysheha, Andriy Lyubka, Ivan Malkovych, Bohdana Matiyash, Petro Midyanka, Kost Moskalets, Ihor Pavlyuk, Ihor Rymaruk, Iryna Shuvalova, Ostap Slyvynskyi, Volodymyr Tsybulko, Oksana Zabuzhko, Serhiy Zhadan.\n\nProse writers: Valeriy Shevchuk, Volodymyr Dibrova, Yuriy Vynnychuk, Yuriy Hudz, Yuri Andrukhovych, Oksana Zabuzhko, Yuri Pokalchuk, Yuriy Izdryk, Yevhen Pashkovskyi, Oles Ulianenko, Stepan Protsyuk, Taras Prokhasko, Natalka Snyadanko, Serhiy Zhadan, Anatoliy Dnistrovyi, Dzvinka Matiyash, Irena Karpa, Tanya Malyarchuk, Lyubko Deresh, Markiyan Kamysh, Victoria Amelina, Iryna Tsilyk, Oleksiy Chupa.\n\nWell known essay writes: Ivan Korsak, Mykola Riabchuk, Vitaliy Zhezhera, Yuri Andrukhovych, Oksana Zabuzhko, Vasyl Makhno, Oleksandr Boychenko, Yurko Prokhasko, Anatoliy Dnistrovyi, Andriy Bondar.\n\nNotable novels: \"Fieldwork in Ukrainian Sex\" (1996) by Oksana Zabuzhko, \"Perverzion\" (1997) by Yuri Andrukhovych, \"Wozzek\" by Yuriy Izdryk, \"Sweet Darusya\" (2002) by Maria Matios, \"A Stroll to the Zone\" (2015) by Markiyan Kamysh.\n\nDrama writers: Oleksandr Irvanets, Nadiya Symych, Neda Nezhdana, Les Podervianskyi, Pavlo Arye, Anna Bahryana, Olena Klymenko, Oleh Mykolaychuk-Nyzovets, Serhiy Shchuchenko, Artem Vyshnevskyi, Oleksandra Pohrebinska, Oleksa Slipets, Volodymyr Serdyuk, Ihor Pavlyuk.\n\nMany books by Yuri Andrukhovych, Oksana Zabuzhko and Serhiy Zhadan have been translated into English.

It is currently New Zealand's largest theatre company and is led by CEO, Philip Aldridge and artistic director Ross Gumbley.\n\nThe company was founded by Yvette Bromley and Mervyn Thompson in 1971 who served as Co-artistic Directors for the first three years of the company. Bromley chose the theatre's name out of affection for the Royal Court Theatre in London, which she knew well from her upbringing and drama education.\n\nDuring the first eighteen months of its existence, The Court had three venues. The first was \"The Stone Chamber of the Canterbury Provincial Council Chambers\" (April – May 1971), where The Court's début production, \"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\" was staged. Occasionally the Māori Land Court would require the use of the chamber, necessitating the set being struck and taken to the Durham Street Art Gallery; the furniture being moved back into the chamber and the processed reversed for the next evening's performance. The Stone Chamber was one of the city's most magnificent structures, but it was impractical for a theatre company, as there was little room for an audience and a lack of toilets.\n\nNext was the \"Durham Street Art Gallery\" (June 1971 – May 1972), which was used as an interim venue between the Canterbury Society of Arts vacating the premises and the Law Court expanding into the area. From June to August 1972, The Court was housed in the \"Beggs Theatrette\" and staged two productions in the space.\n\nThe next four years (September 1972 – February 1976) were a period of relative stability. The Court Theatre was housed at The Orange Hall on Worcester Street. In 1974, Mervyn Thompson stood down leaving Yvette Bromley as sole Artistic Director until 1975 when Randall Wackrow (who had joined the company as Business Manager in 1973) joined her as Co-artistic Director.\n\nIn 1976, the company moved to the Christchurch Arts Centre complex, in the buildings which were formerly the Engineering School of Canterbury College. The performance space was previously lecture room D.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1978, Randall Wackrow served as sole Artistic Director, standing down in 1979 with the appointment of Elric Hooper. Hooper served as Artistic Director for more than two decades. Hooper declared his intent to balance the theatre's repertoire with \"three main thrusts — the classic, the contemporary and the indigenous\". Although economic pressure saw a fledgling second auditorium, \"Court Two\", closed as a regular venue following the economic slump of the mid-eighties (although it was to be later revived as \"The Forge\"), overall this philosophy was rewarded.\n\nAs the new millennium approached, The Court saw growth across the board — in audiences, income and acclaim, and expanded its company with the introduction of Theatresports to Australasia in the late 1980s and the formation of professional improvisation troupe, The Court Jesters. In 1990, Hooper was awarded the MBE and the 1990 Commemoration medal by the Queen. Hooper retired as Artistic Director in 1999 and Catherine Downes served as Artistic Director of The Court Theatre from 2000–2005. Ross Gumbley has been The Court's Artistic Director from 2006.\n\nThe Court operated two auditoria at the Arts Centre. Court One seated 291 in a broad 'semi-thrust' stage, staging at least eight productions each season totalling approximately 270 performances annually. Each season contained a mix of New Zealand works, modern international theatre and classics.\n\nThe Forge (formerly known as Court Two) seated 123 in a 'box' setting with the audience seated on two sides. Until recently it was used as a hosting venue by touring or independent productions, but since 2007 The Forge was used by the Court for staging challenging international, local and devised works, with an aim of attracting a different audience demographic from its Court One patronage.\n\nThe Court Theatre employs professionals from around the country and internationally. It sustains a full-time professional staff and an ensemble acting company and is administered by The Court Theatre Trust. At any one time there can be up to 100 people working full-time at The Court Theatre.\n\nIn addition to being a full-time professional theatre company, The Court Theatre operates numerous other activities in the community. The company annually tours a show regionally around the South Island. Its education programme provides training for school-age students and adults, regularly liaising with high school and tertiary institutions as well as other community groups. The company also produces school holiday kids' shows and an annual touring primary school show.\n\nFurthermore, the company employs a troupe of professional improvisors and corporate entertainers, The Court Jesters. The most public face of their work is the improv comedy show \"Scared Scriptless\" which is staged every Friday and Saturday night at The Court Theatre.\n\n"}

It includes various forms of art therapy, whereby individuals and groups can express themselves to nurture healing and restoration. It is also used to overcome the recurrence of violence, as a preventative measure to make the foundations of peace stronger, especially in contexts of war and conflict. Creating an environment of lasting peace is the primary goal of creative peacebuilding.\n\nAccording to Johan Galtung, peacebuilding is the process of creating self-supporting structures that \"remove causes of wars and offer alternatives to war in situations where wars might occur.\" For John Paul Lederach, peacebuilding is a comprehensive concept that encompasses, generates, and sustains the full array of processes, approaches, and stages needed to transform conflict toward more sustainable, peaceful relationships, which involves a wide range of activities. It has a diverse range of interaction and involves various stakeholders in various levels within the spectrum of governance and development.\n\nCreative peacebuilding facilitates the establishments of sustainable peace by preventing recurrence of violence, addresses the root causes, healing and effects of conflict, and offer alternatives to violence through reconciliation, economic and social transformation with the use of photography, film, painting, and the like. Jolyon Mitchell argues that the visual arts can both encourage peacebuilding and instigating violence. This is true of various forms of visual arts, ranging from posters, cartoons, and stained glass, to websites, radio, and films by reflecting on examples from around the world.\n\nCreative peacebuilding can be especially powerful when used with those suffering from a young demographic and those with post-traumatic stress disorder. For at-risk youth, it lays the roots for a peaceful lifestyle and to help children who have already experienced trauma in their lives become fully functional adults.\n\nArt therapy has been used to help rehabilitate child soldiers in Uganda as well as to help children who lost their homes in the tsunami of 2004 cope with their feelings. Many youth centers catering to impoverished children use art forms to build community, discipline and trust.\n\nMusic therapy can be used in several different fashions to build peace. It can be used to help individuals express themselves or to foster communication between individuals or groups of people. It can be used to nurture healing and reconciliation. Music is something that transcends language and national or ethnic boundaries. It has unique styles depending on the community it originates in and can also be adapted to fit individual's tastes. When two groups who have been in conflict or have the potential for conflict make music together communication and healing become possible. When individuals listen to or play music, they can reduce their stress levels and express their feelings.\n\nVisual art therapy can be used to help individuals cope with their feelings resulting from violent experiences. It is also used to treat post-traumatic stress disorder. Art therapy is especially useful for people who are having trouble verbalizing their feelings and are keeping them bottled up. By sharing their experiences and processing them through a tactical and visual activity, people are able to heal. No prior experience with visual art is needed to participate in and gain benefits from art therapy—it is about the process of creation, not about the aesthetic appeal of the product. Art therapy can be used in group settings as well—creating a collaborative art project can be an experience that bridges differences between people and builds feelings of trust.\n\nIf people who have lived through traumatic or violent experiences can relive them and change the situation or their response to the situation they can come to terms with their past. Virtual technology and especially virtual reality simulations can be especially useful in cases like these and have been used to treat veterans of the Iraq war who are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. If the technology needed for these simulations is too expensive to be practical, mental visualization, in which the victim uses their imagination to create situations and feel as if they are gaining control of the way events play out, can be used as an alternative.\n\nCreate Peace Project is an arts-for-peace education organization working to promote the practices of peace and spread the message of hope and goodwill to children around the world using creativity. Create Peace Project was founded in San Francisco, California in 2007 by artist and peace activist Ross Holzman in response to the overwhelming amount of violence in the world, on the news, and in our communities. Violence, coupled with the lack of creativity in peoples lives sparked the creation of projects such as Banners for Peace and The Peace Exchange. Create Peace Project has included more than 25,000 children from around the world in its arts-for-peace projects since its inception and continues to work with schools in the US and beyond promoting peace through creativity to children of all ages.\n\nArtist Lily Yeh has helped to heal the wounds genocide left on a village of widows and orphans through her work with Barefoot Artists. The members of the community were provided with a chance to honor their lost loved ones through their construction of a beautiful and expressive monument commemorating the mass grave of the local victims of the genocide. The construction process also provided a sense of closure to their mourning. Other aspects of the peacebuilding process in the village included paintings on building walls created by the village children of things that they hoped to see in the future as well as things important to their everyday existence. On the economic side of this peacebuilding effort, the people of the village learned how to mosaic and pour concrete, two useful and marketable skills to help provide economic stability.\n\nIn the United State, creative peacebuilding is used in many inner-city areas in places such as New York, Philadelphia, and Louisville. The River City Drum Corps in Louisville, Ky provides a musical outlet for children who perhaps are not listened to in other parts of their lives. It is also a structured program where discipline and the importance of both uniqueness and teamwork are taught. The children learn drumming patterns and perform for different events and groups of people throughout the city. Both the children in the program and their audience benefit from the cultural exchange and communication that take place during drum corps performances.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2372739", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2372739", "title": "Descent from the Cross", "text": "Descent from the Cross\n\nThe Descent from the Cross (, \"Apokathelosis\"), or Deposition of Christ, is the scene, as depicted in art, from the Gospels' accounts of Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus taking Christ down from the cross after his crucifixion (). In Byzantine art the topic became popular in the 9th century, and in the West from the 10th century. The Descent from the Cross is the 13th Station of the Cross.\n\nOther figures not mentioned in the Gospels who are often included in depictions of this subject include St. John the Evangelist, who is sometimes depicted supporting a fainting Mary (as in the work below by Rogier van der Weyden), and Mary Magdalene. The Gospels mention an undefined number of women as watching the crucifixion, including the Three Marys, (Mary Salome being mentioned in ), and also that the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene saw the burial (). These and further women and unnamed male helpers are often shown.\n\nEven in early depictions the details and posing of the composition, and especially the position of Christ's body, are varied. The scene was usually included in medieval cycles of the Life or the Passion of Christ, between the Crucifixion and the \"Entombment of Christ\". The \"Lamentation of Christ\", or \"Pietà\", showing the body of Christ held by Mary, may intervene between these two, and is common as an individual image, especially in sculpture. The \"Bearing of the body\", showing Christ's body being carried to his tomb, and the \"Anointing of Christ's body\", showing the body laid flat on the top of the tomb or a similarly-shaped \"anointing-stone\" are other scenes that may be shown. This last is especially important in Orthodox art, where it is shown on the Epitaphios.\n\nWith the Renaissance the subject became popular for altarpieces, partly because of the challenges of the composition, and the suitability of its vertical shape. The Mannerist version of Rosso Fiorentino is usually regarded as his most important work, and Pontormo's altarpiece is perhaps his most ambitious work. The subject was painted several times by both Rubens and Rembrandt, who repeated one of his paintings (now in Munich) in a large print, his only one to be mainly engraved, as well as making two other etchings of the subject.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "593758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=593758", "title": "Dichromacy", "text": "Dichromacy\n\nDichromacy (\"di\" meaning \"two\" and \"chroma\" meaning \"color\") is the state of having two types of functioning color receptors, called cone cells, in the eyes. Organisms with dichromacy are called dichromats. Dichromats can match any color they see with a mixture of no more than two pure spectral lights. By comparison, trichromats require three pure spectral lights to match all colors that they can perceive, and tetrachromats require four.\n\nDichromacy in humans is a color vision defect in which one of the three basic color mechanisms is absent or not functioning. It is hereditary and sex-linked, predominantly affecting males. Dichromacy occurs when one of the cone pigments is missing and color is reduced to two dimensions.\n\nThere are various kinds of color blindness:\n\n\nThe three determining elements of a dichromatic opponent-colour space are the missing colour, the null-luminance plane, and the null-chrominance plane. The description of the phenomena itself does not indicate the colour that is impaired to the dichromat, however, it does provides enough information to identify the fundamental colour space, the colours that are seen by the dichromat. This is based on testing both the null-chrominance plane and null-luminance plane which intersect on the missing colour. The cones excited to a corresponding colour in the colour space are visible to the dichromat and those that are not excited are the missing colours.\n\nIt is more informative to use situations where less than the total visual system is operating when studying about vision. For example, a system by which cones are the sole visual receptors could be used. This is rare in humans but certain animals possess this trait and this proves useful in understanding the concept of dichromacy.\n\nWhile their Triassic ancestors were trichromatic, placental mammals are as a rule dichromatic; the ability to see long wavelengths (and thus separate green and red) was lost in the ancestor of placental mammals, though it is believed to have been retained in marsupials, where trichromatic vision is widespread. Recent genetic and behavioral evidence suggests the South American marsupial \"Didelphis albiventris\" is dichromatic, with only two classes of cone opsins having been found within the genus \"Didelphis\". Dichromatic vision may improve an animal's ability to distinguish colours in dim light; the typically nocturnal nature of mammals, therefore, may have led to the evolution of dichromacy as the basal mode of vision in placental animals.\n\nThe exceptions to dichromatic vision in placental mammals are primates closely related to humans, which are usually trichromats, and sea mammals (both pinnipeds and cetaceans) which are cone monochromats. New World Monkeys are a partial exception: in most species, males are dichromats, and about 60% of females are trichromats, but the owl monkeys are cone monochromats, and both sexes of howler monkeys are trichromats.\n\nAccording to colour vision researchers at the Medical College of Wisconsin (including Jay Neitz), each of the three standard colour-detecting cones in the retina of trichromats – blue, green and red – can pick up about 100 different gradations of colour. If each detector is independent of the others, simple exponentiation gives a total number of colours discernible by an average human as their product, or about 1 million; nevertheless, other researchers have put the number at upwards of 2.3 million. Exponentiation suggests that a dichromat (such as a human with red-green color blindness) would be able to distinguish about 10,000 different colours, but no such calculation has been verified by psychophysical testing.\n\nFurthermore, dichromats have a significantly higher threshold than trichromats for coloured stimuli flickering at low (1 Hz) frequencies. At higher (10 or 16 Hz) frequencies, dichromats perform as well as or better than trichromats. This means such animals would still observe the flicker instead of a temporally fused visual percept as is the case in human movie watching at a high enough frame rate.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10259320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10259320", "title": "Duiliu Zamfirescu", "text": "Duiliu Zamfirescu\n\nDuiliu Zamfirescu (30 October 1858 – 3 June 1922) was a Romanian novelist, poet, short story writer, lawyer, nationalist politician, journalist, diplomat and memoirist. In 1909, he was elected a member of the Romanian Academy, and, for a while in 1920, he was Foreign Minister of Romania. Zamfirescu is best remembered for his \"Comăneștenilor\" literary cycle, comprising his novels \"Viața la țară\", \"Tănase Scatiu\", \"În război\", \"Îndreptări\" and \"Anna\".\n\nBorn in Plăinești, Râmnicu Sărat County (present-day Dumbrăveni, Vrancea County), he attended elementary school and gymnasium in Focșani, and later studied at the Matei Basarab High School in Bucharest (1873–1876), before entering the University of Bucharest's Faculty of Law. He graduated in 1880.\n\nZamfirescu made his debut with a series of poems in \"Ghimpele\" review (1877), and, later in the same year, became an enthusiastic supporter of the Romanian war effort during the Independence War, an experience which placed its mark on his later works and choice of subjects. Three years later, he became associated with Alexandru Macedonski's \"Literatorul\", a circle of Symbolist writers, publishing a Romantic poem titled \"Levante și Kalavryta\" (\"Levante and Kalavryta\"). At the time, his work was under the influence of Macedonski's Parnassianism.\n\nIn 1880, he was appointed public prosecutor in the Northern Dobrujan town of Hârșova, while being employed, until 1884, as literary columnist for \"România Liberă\". At the time, the editorial staff also included the writers Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea, Alexandru Vlahuță, and D. D. Racoviță-Sphinx. Zamfirescu contributed articles in which he declared his dislike for naturalism, as well as distancing himself from the Realism of his contemporaries Ion Luca Caragiale and Ioan Slavici (despite common perception, he claimed he had \"nothing in common\" with the latter two). At the time, he also contributed political articles under the pen name \"Don Padil\".\n\nIn 1882, after briefly serving as a prosecutor in Târgoviște and resigning, Duiliu Zamfirescu moved back to Focșani, where he practiced law and was a French language substitute teacher. Later in the same year, he settled in Bucharest and joined \"România Liberă\"'s editorial staff, publishing his first volume of prose and poems, \"Fără titlu\" (\"Untitled\"), in 1883. Zamfirescu authored his debut novel, \"În fața vieții\" (\"Facing Life\") in 1884—the work was noted for the chapter \"Pesimistul de la Soleni\" (\"The Pessimist of Soleni\"), a satire of the Russian-born socialist thinker Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea.\n\nIn 1885, he came out first in an examination for the office of legation \"Attaché\", and was consequently employed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, while at the same time teaching the Romanian language at the Sf. Gheorghe High School. He also began associating with the \"Junimea\" circle and began writing for its magazine, \"Convorbiri Literare\", bringing his writings to the attention of Titu Maiorescu, while becoming a regular in the literary circle formed around the restaurant Casa Capșa. He was part of a small group of literary figures who oscillated between \"Literatorul\" and Maiorescu's circle—others to do so were Vasile Alecsandri, Veronica Micle and Matilda Cugler-Poni. The first of his poems to be published with Maiorescu's approval was titled \"Iarna\" (\"Winter\")—printed in June 1884. Zamfirescu is considered one of the most important writers to have been associated with \"Junimea\" during the final stage of its existence. He nonetheless maintained some distance to the society, and reportedly irritated Titu Maiorescu by collaborating with the newly established anti-\"Junimist\" magazines \"Literatură și Artă Română\" (edited by N. Petraşcu, on whom Zamfirescu was to be an influence, and Dimitrie C. Ollănescu-Ascanio).\n\nUltimately, in May 1885, Zamfirescu was dispatched to Italy, as legation secretary in Rome, a position which he filled until 1906, with a hiatus (1892–1894) during which he was assigned to Greece and later Belgium. He was a colleague of Dimitrie Ghyka, and remembered for welcoming the ethnic Romanian Transylvanian activist Badea Cârţan during the latter's celebrated trip to the Italian capital (1896). Zamfirescu married an Italian woman, Henrietta Allievi, who died in 1920.\n\nAn enthusiastic admirer of Leo Tolstoy's writings, he began work on a monograph entirely dedicated to the latter (excerpts of which were first published in 1892 issues of \"Convorbiri Literare\"). With his 1894 volume of poetry \"Alte orizonturi\" (\"Other Horizons\"), Zamfirescu entered a prolific phase of his literary career: in 1894-1895, \"Convorbiri Literare\" serialized his novel \"Viața la țară\" (\"Life in the Country\"), followed in 1895-1896 by \"Tănase Scatiu\", and, in 1897-1898, \"În război\" (\"At War\"); in 1895, he also published his collected novellas (\"Nuvele romane\", \"Roman Novellas\"), followed by the poetry volumes \"Imnuri păgâne\" (\"Pagan Hymns\", 1897), and \"Poezii nouă\" (\"New Poems\", 1899).\n\nHis relations with Dobrogeanu-Gherea was tense, but, in 1890, Zamfirescu approved of the decision taken by the Theodor Rosetti cabinet to award the Romanian citizenship to the philosopher (at a time when his Jewish ethnicity would have made it extremely hard to obtain). The same year, Dobrogeanu-Gherea published a study of Zamfirescu's works. The two opposed each other over economic ideas and Dobrogeanu-Gherea's application of Marxism to the Romanian society—examining the works of Achille Loria, Zamfirescu collected Marxist-inspired notions that, he believed, contradicted Dobrogeanu-Gherea from inside his own camp. When Maiorescu and the Romanian Marxists were engaged in a lengthy polemic, he added his own arguments in support of the former.\n\nBetween 1901 and 1902, his novel \"Îndreptări\" (\"Betterments\") was serialized by the magazine \"Literatură și Artă Română\", which was a sign of cooling relations between Zamfirescu and his mentor Maiorescu (nevertheless, \"Convorbiri Literare\" continued to publish Zamfirescu's novel \"Anna\" in 1906). He apparently sought to include in his work both major tendencies of 19th century Romanian literature—\"art for art's sake\" as preached by Maiorescu and the \"tendentious art\" notably advocated by Dobrogeanu-Gherea. Around 1905, through the articles of Simion Mehedinți, his work came to be criticized by the traditionalist magazine \"Sămănătorul\", who coupled a rejection of modernism with an appreciation of for folklore.\n\nIn 1909, Zamfirescu was accepted to the Academy, and delivered a much-discussed speech on the influence of Poporanism and traditionalism in literature, showing his disapproval for both currents. It stated:\n\"I do not go as far as to state that the peasants' soul is not at all interesting to literature; that is because for me, all of nature is interesting. Despite this, the greatest critics and the greatest creators of human characters do not deal with simple souls, because they are as uneventful as nothingness itself.\"\n\nZamfirescu thus attacked the use of folklore for direct inspiration, which saw Maiorescu, among others, defending folk literature and its supporters. Maiorescu had by then ceased most contacts with his former protégé. There were also notable tensions between Zamfirescu and the Transylvanian poet Octavian Goga, whose work was hailed as an example by both Maiorescu and \"Sămănătorul\".\n\nThe same year, Zamfirescu was named a Minister Plenipotentiary and the Romanian Kingdom's envoy to the Danube Commission. His \"Furfanțo\" volume of short stories and his novel \"Lydda\" were both printed in 1911. He was relieved of his diplomatic post in 1913, at a time when Maiorescu became Premier of a Conservative Party cabinet—this came after a Romanian Army officer reported statements made by Zamfirescu, which he alleged were unpatriotic. Reportedly, Maiorescu never gave Zamfirescu a chance to explain himself.\n\nDuring World War I, following the occupation of southern Romania by the Central Powers, Zamfirescu followed Romanian authorities in their Iaşi refuge. By late 1918, he became a founding member of the People's Party, led by General Alexandru Averescu, and edited the Iași-based voice of the movement, \"Îndreptarea\". Under the second Averescu cabinet, Zamfirescu served as Foreign Minister in March–June 1920, and then as President of the Chamber of Deputies.\n\nHis short term in office was noted for the establishment of Romanian relations with the Holy See (\"see Roman Catholicism in Romania\"). In 1919, Vladimir Ghika had been appointed Romanian representative to the Papacy by the National Romanian Council, an institution which campaigned for the recognition of Greater Romania at the Paris Peace Conference. When Ghika's term expired, he was replaced by Zamfirescu with Dimitrie Pennescu, who was Romania's first Ambassador to the Vatican. The Apostolic Nunciature in Romania was set up as a result of this, and first held by Archbishop Francesco Marmaggi.\n\nDuiliu Zamfirescu's last published works were his poetry volume \"Pe Marea Neagră\" (\"On the Black Sea\", 1919) and a collection of autobiographical pieces and short stories, \"O muză\" (\"A Muse\", 1920). In July 1921, he was involved in projects to crown King Ferdinand I as \"King of Greater Romania\". He died at Agapia in 1922, and was buried in Focșani's southern cemetery.\n\nZamfirescu's creations were original in style, blending a series of contrasting influences. One of the most enduring of these was the prose of Nicolae Gane. After parting with Parnassianism and Romanticism, Duiliu Zamfirescu adopted some of Gane's themes (including his compassionate perspective on the decay of low-ranking boyars as a social class) and, in part, his storytelling techniques. The writer was also known for the frequent comparisons he drew between his novels and those of Leo Tolstoy. Most of his later works bear the imprint of Neoclassicism.\n\nThe impact of \"Junimea\" guidelines in his writings is a disputed subject. An opponent of both strict Realism and rural traditionalism, Zamfirescu ridiculed the works of \"Junimist\" novelist Ioan Slavici as \"sentimental mawkishness\". Such contradictions have literary historians such as Tudor Vianu to leave him out of their essays on \"Junimism\". It was also proposed that Zamfirescu associated with both \"Literatorul\" and \"Junimea\" due to one of their very few common traits, which was political in nature: the two groups shared Zamfirescu's conservatism and his interest in preserving a Romanian aristocracy on the boyar model. Although his similarities with \"Junimea\" were extended after he adopted Neoclassical guidelines, Zamfirescu strongly disagreed with Maiorescu and his disciples on the issue of peasant themes and folklore in novels, arguing that the new literature was supposed to draw inspiration from the urban environment and the rural upper class. In one instance, he is known to have referred to \"Junimea\"'s theory on the peasant novel using the French expression \"c'est bourgeois et plat\" (\"it is bourgeois and plain\").\n\nIn many ways, however, Zamfirescu was a Realist, notably using the guidelines imposed by \"Junimea\" as a means to give an accurate portrayal of his characters' speech. Researcher Z. Ornea argued that the main disagreement between him and the literary society was over Maiorescu's view that the national values of Romania were mostly embodied by the peasants, with Zamfirescu arguing that these had also been preserved by the cultured groups of low-ranking boyars. As noted by Ornea, Zamfirescu's focus on the latter group and his nationalism came to contrast with his aesthetic guidelines, and, paradoxically, led to virtually all of his novels having a rural background and displaying a strong sympathy for the peasantry.\n\nThus, Zamfirescu's positive characters lash out at boyars of foreign origins, to whom they refer as \"Phanariotes\", and tolerate the unscrupulous Tănase Scatiu in their company only because he is from the countryside. In parallel, Scatiu is also disliked for being a Greek and a profiteering estate leaseholder—indicative of Zamfirescu's own social and national views. Zamfirescu believed in a strong and natural connection between the landowners and their property, as well as between the landowners and their community—this theme was found with many conservatives of his day, including the \"Junimists\" Petre P. Carp and Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, and announced a similar theory constructed by historian Nicolae Iorga. In his fictional world, peasants make brief appearances as secondary characters, noted for their deep respect for the traditional owners, as well as for their dislike of all change. In parallel, Zamfirescu introduced socialist agitators as negative characters, and, in \"Lume nouă şi lume veche\" (\"New World and Old World\"), one of his less known novels, gave them the central stage as a means to satirize them.\n\nDuiliu Zamfirescu remained a maverick throughout his life, and his publicized outbursts against various trends has probably contributed to the decline in interests among his public and critics. Ornea described him as \"immeasurably arrogant, petulant and a snob\", noting that these traits had led to \"unjust\" treatment of his work. During the interwar period, Zamfirescu's views were defended by the modernist critic Eugen Lovinescu, whose arguments were later rejected by his colleague George Călinescu—the latter argued that Lovinescu had failed to prove Zamfirescu's aesthetic value. Criticism of Zamfirescu was especially acute after his 1909 speech, when both competing traditionalist currents, Poporanism and \"Sămănătorul\", attacked his work in its entirety. However, according to Ornea, Zamfirescu's novels serve as a bridge between \"Junimea\" and 20th century traditionalism.\n\nCritics have traditionally held a more favorable view of Zamfirescu's correspondence, which was only published after 1937. Offering a glimpse into his lengthy investigation of artistic styles and tenets, they have won acclaim for their refinement.\n\n"}

It is arguably the painting for which Johns is best known.\n\nThe US flag was in the news repeatedly in 1954. The McCarthy hearings came to a close on 17 June 1954, only three days after Flag Day. On Flag Day, U.S. President Dwight D.

It is made using encaustic, oil paint, and newsprint collage on three separate canvases, mounted on a plywood board. The painting reflects the three colors of the US flag: red, white and blue; the flag is depicted in the form it took between 1912 and 1959, with 48 white stars on a blue canton representing the then-US states (excluding Alaska and Hawaii), and with thirteen red and white stripes. Newsprint is visible under the stripes. Reading the texts, it is clear that the newsprint was not selected at random: Johns steered clear of headlines, or national or political news, and used inconsequential articles or adverts. The painting has a rough-textured surface, and the 48 stars are not identical. It is dated 1954 on its reverse.\n\nJohns's selection of the US flag allows him to explore a familiar two-dimensional object, with its simple internal geometric structure and a complex symbolic meaning. Johns was attracted to painting \"things the mind already knows\", and claimed that using a familiar object like the flag freed himself from the need to create a new design and allowed him to focus on the execution of the painting. Critics were unsure whether it was a painted flag or a painting \"of\" a flag; Johns later said it was both. His work is often described as Neo-Dadaist and anticipates aspects of pop art, minimal art, and conceptual art.\n\nJohns made over 40 works based on the US flag, including a large and monochrome \"White Flag\" in 1955, and his 1958 work \"Three Flags\" with three superimposed flags showing a total of 84 stars.\n\nIn November 2014 the encaustic \"Flag\" (1983) was auctioned off for $36,000,000 at Sotheby's New York.\n\nThe painting was included in Johns's first solo exhibition at the Leo Castelli Gallery in early 1958. Alfred Barr, director of the Museum of Modern Art, wanted to buy the work, but was concerned that it might be considered unpatriotic. He persuaded a friend, Philip Johnson, to buy it instead; Johnson bought it, and donated it to the Museum of Modern Art \"in honor of Alfred H. Barr, Jr.\" when he retired in 1968.\n\n"}

{"id": "1396834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1396834", "title": "High culture", "text": "High culture\n\nHigh culture encompasses the cultural products of aesthetic value, which a society collectively esteem as exemplary art. It may also include intellectual works considered to be of supreme philosophical, historical, or literary value, as well as the education which cultivates such aesthetic and intellectual pursuits. In popular usage, the term \"high culture\" identifies the culture of an upper class (an aristocracy) or of a status class (the intelligentsia); and also identifies a society’s common repository of broad-range knowledge and tradition (e.g. folk culture) that transcends the social-class system of the society. Sociologically, the term \"high culture\" is contrasted with the term \"low culture\", the forms of popular culture characteristic of the less-educated social classes, such as the barbarians, the Philistines, and \"hoi polloi\" (the masses).\n\nIn European history, high culture was understood as a cultural concept common to the humanities, until the mid-19th century, when Matthew Arnold introduced the term \"high culture\" in the book \"Culture and Anarchy\" (1869). The Preface defines culture as \"the disinterested endeavour after man’s perfection\" pursued, obtained, and achieved by effort to \"know the best that has been said and thought in the world.\" Such a literary definition of high culture also comprehends philosophy. Moreover, the philosophy of aesthetics proposed in high culture is a force for moral and political good. Critically, the term \"high culture\" is contrasted with the terms \"popular culture\" and \"mass culture\".\n\nIn \"Notes Towards the Definition of Culture\" (1948), T. S. Eliot said that high culture and popular culture are necessary and complementary parts of the culture of a society. In \"The Uses of Literacy\" (1957), Richard Hoggart presents the sociologic experience of the working-class man and woman in acquiring the cultural literacy, at university, which facilitates social upward mobility. In the U.S., Harold Bloom and F. R. Leavis pursued the definition of high culture, by way of the Western canon of literature.\nMedia theorist Steven Johnson writes that, unlike popular culture, \"the classics—and soon to be classics—are\" in their own right descriptions and explanations of the cultural systems that produced them.\" He says that \"a crucial way in which mass culture differs from high art\" is that individual works of mass culture are less interesting than the broader cultural trends which produced them.\n\nHistory of high culture in the West\n\nThe high culture of the West originated in the classical-world traditions of intellectual and aesthetic life in Ancient Greece (from c. 8th century BC – AD 147) and Ancient Rome (753 BC – AD 476). In the classical Greco-Roman tradition, the ideal mode of language was published and preserved in works of elevated style (correct grammar, syntax, and diction). Certain forms of language used by authors in valorized epochs were held up in antiquity and the Renaissance as eternal valid models and normative standards of excellence; e.g. the Attic dialect of ancient Greek spoken and written by the playwrights and philosophers of Periclean Athens (fifth century BC); and the form of classical Latin used in the \"Golden Age\" of Roman culture (c. 70 B.C. - AD 18) represented by such figures as Cicero and Virgil.This form of education was known to the Greeks as παιδεία, which was translated by the Romans into Latin as \"humanitas\" 'since it reflected a form of education aiming at the refinement of human nature, rather than the acquisition of technical or vocational skills. Indeed, the Greco-Roman world tended to see such manual, commercial, and technical labor as subordinate to purely intellectual activities. From the idea of the \"free\" man with sufficient leisure to pursue such intellectual and aesthetic refinement, arose the classical distinction between the \"liberal\" arts which are intellectual and done for their own sake, as against the \"servile\"or \"mechanical\" arts which were associated with manual labor and done to earn a living.\nThis implied an association between high culture and the upper classes whose inherited wealth provided such time for intellectual cultivation. The leisured gentleman not weighed down by the necessity of earning a living, was free to devote himself to activities proper to such a \"free man\" – those deemed to involve true excellence and nobility as opposed to mere utility.\nDuring the Renaissance, the classical intellectual values of the fully rediscovered Græco–Roman culture were the cultural capital of the upper classes(and the aspiring), and aimed at the complete development of human intellectual, aesthetic, and moral faculties. This ideal associated with humanism (a later term derived from the humanities or \"studia humanitatis\"), was communicated in Renaissance Italy through institutions such as the Renaissance court schools. Renaissance humanism soon spread through Europe becoming much of the basis of upper class education for centuries. For the socially ambitious man and woman who means to rise in society, \"The Book of the Courtier\" (1528), by Baldasare Castiglione, instructs the reader to acquire and possess knowledge of the Græco–Roman Classics, being education integral to the social-persona of the aristocrat. A key contribution of the Renaissance was the elevation of painting and sculpture to a status equal to the liberal arts (hence the visual arts lost for elites any lingering negative association with manual artisanship.) The early Renaissance treatises of Leon Battista Alberti were instrumental in this regard.\n\nThe evolution of the concept of high culture initially was defined in educational terms largely as critical study and knowledge of the Græco–Roman arts and humanities which furnished much of the foundation for European cultures and societies. However, aristocratic patronage through most of the modern era was also pivotal to the support and creation of new works of high culture across the range of arts, music, and literature. The subsequent prodigious development of the modern European languages and cultures meant that the modern definition of the term \"high culture\" embraces not only Greek and Latin texts, but a much broader canon of select literary, philosophical, historical, and scientific books in both ancient and modern languages. Of comparable importance are those works of art and music considered to be of the highest excellence and broadest influence (e.g. the Parthenon, the painting and sculpture of Michelangelo, the music of Mozart, etc). Together these texts and art works constitute the exemplary artifacts representing the high culture of the Western world. \nIn the Western and some East Asian traditions, art that demonstrates the imagination of the artist is accorded the status of high art. In the West this tradition began in Ancient Greece, was reinforced in the Renaissance, and by Romanticism, which eliminated the hierarchy of genres within the fine arts, which was established in the Renaissance. In China there was a distinction between the literati painting by the scholar-officials and the work produced by common artists, working in largely different styles, or the decorative arts such as Chinese porcelain which were produced by unknown craftsmen working in large factories. In both China and the West the distinction was especially clear in landscape painting, where for centuries imaginary views, produced from the imagination of the artist, were considered superior works.\n\nIn socially-stratified Europe and the Americas, a first-hand immersion to the high culture of the West, the Grand Tour of Europe, was a rite of passage that complemented and completed the book education of a gentleman, from the nobility, the aristocracy, and the bourgeoisie, with a worldly perspective of society and civilisation. The post-university tour of the cultural centres of Europe was a social-class benefit of the cultural capital transmitted through the high-status institutions (schools, academies, universities) meant to produce the ideal gentleman of that society. \n\nThe European concept of high culture included cultivation of refined etiquette and manners; the education of taste in the fine arts such as sculpture and painting; an appreciation of classical music and opera in its diverse history and myriad forms; knowledge of the humane letters (\"literae humaniores\") represented by the best Greek and Latin authors, and more broadly of the liberal arts traditions (e.g. philosophy, history, drama, rhetoric, and poetry) of Western civilisation, as well as a general acquaintance with important concepts in theology, science, and political thought.\n\nMuch of high culture consists of the appreciation of what is sometimes called \"high art\". This term is rather broader than Arnold's definition and besides literature includes music, visual arts (especially painting), and traditional forms of the performing arts (including some cinema). The decorative arts would not generally be considered high art.\n\nThe cultural products most often regarded as forming part of high culture are most likely to have been produced during periods of high civilization, for which a large, sophisticated, and wealthy urban-based society provides a coherent and conscious aesthetic framework, and a large-scale milieu of training, and, for the visual arts, sourcing materials and financing work. Such an environment enables artists, as near as possible, to realize their creative potential with as few as possible practical and technical constraints. Although the Western concept of high culture naturally concentrates on the Greco-Roman tradition, and its resumption from the Renaissance onwards, such conditions existed in other places at other times.\n\nArt music (or serious music or erudite music) is an umbrella term used to refer to musical traditions implying advanced structural and theoretical considerations and a written musical tradition. The notion of art music is a frequent and well-defined musicological distinction – musicologist Philip Tagg, for example, refers to art music as one of an \"axiomatic triangle consisting of 'folk', 'art' and 'popular' musics\". He explains that each of these three is distinguishable from the others according to certain criteria, with high cultural music often performed to an audience whilst folk music would traditionally be more participatory. In this regard, \"art music\" frequently occurs as a contrasting term to \"popular music\" and to \"traditional\" or \"folk music\".\n\nArt film is the result of filmmaking which is typically a serious, independent film aimed at a niche market rather than a mass market audience. Film critics and film studies scholars typically define an \"art film\" using a \"...canon of films and those formal qualities that mark them as different from mainstream Hollywood films\", which includes, among other elements: a social realism style; an emphasis on the authorial expressivity of the director or writer; and a focus on the thoughts and dreams of characters, rather than presenting a clear, goal-driven story. According to the film scholar David Bordwell, \"art cinema itself is a film genre, with its own distinct conventions.\"\n\nThe term has always been susceptible to attack for elitism, and, in response, many proponents of the concept devoted great efforts to promoting high culture among a wider public than the highly educated bourgeoisie whose natural territory it was supposed to be. There was a drive, beginning in the 19th century, to open museums and concert halls to give the general public access to high culture. Figures such as John Ruskin and Lord Reith of the BBC in Britain, Leon Trotsky and others in Communist Russia, and many others in America and throughout the western world have worked to widen the appeal of elements of high culture such as classical music, art by old masters and the literary classics.\n\nWith the widening of access to university education, the effort spread there, and all aspects of high culture became the objects of academic study, which with the exception of the classics had not often been the case until the late 19th century. University liberal arts courses still play an important role in the promotion of the concept of high culture, though often now avoiding the term itself.\n\nEspecially in Europe, governments have been prepared to subsidize high culture through the funding of museums, opera and ballet companies, orchestras, cinema, public broadcasting stations such as BBC Radio 3, ARTE, and in other ways. Organizations such as the Arts Council of Great Britain, and in most European countries, whole ministries administer these programs. This includes the subsidy of new works by composers, writers and artists. There are also many private philanthropic sources of funding, which are especially important in the US, where the federally funded Corporation for Public Broadcasting also funds broadcasting. These may be seen as part of the broader concept of official culture, although often a mass audience is not the intended market.\n\nThe relations between high culture and mass culture are concerns of cultural studies, media studies, and critical theory, sociology, Postmodernism and Marxist philosophy. In the essay \"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\" (1936), Walter Benjamin explored the relations of value of the arts (high and mass) when subjected to industrial reproduction. The critical theoreticians Theodor W. Adorno and Antonio Gramsci interpreted the high-art and mass-art cultural relations as an instrument of social control, with which the ruling class maintain their cultural hegemony upon society.\n\nFor the Orientalist Ernest Renan and for the rationalist philosopher Ernest Gellner, high culture was conceptually integral to the politics and ideology of nationalism, as a requisite part of a healthy national identity. Gellner expanded the conceptual scope of the phrase in \"Nations and Nationalism\" (1983) stating that high art is \"a literate, codified culture, which permits context-free communication\" among cultures.\n\nIn \"Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste\" (1979), the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu proposed that æsthetic taste (cultural judgement), derived from social class, in establishing definitions of high art by the practice of human activities such as social etiquette, gastronomy, oenology, military service. That in such activities of aesthetic judgement, the ruling-class person uses social codes unknown to middle- and the lower-class persons in the pursuit and practice activities of taste.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55149872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55149872", "title": "Hoplite formation in art", "text": "Hoplite formation in art\n\nThe hoplites were soldiers from Ancient Greece who were usually free citizens. They had a very uniform and distinct appearance; specifically they were armed with a spear (\"dory\") in their right hand and a heavy round shield in their left.\n\nHoplite soldiers were organized in battle into the \"Phalanx formation\". The goal of this formation was to create uniformity and a powerful military force in order to maximize the effectiveness as the army as a whole, rather than use people as individual fighters. With the hoplite formation everyone was the same in battle. The Phalanx formation appeared during the 7th and 8th centuries BC.\n\nThe representation of hoplites in art show historians how the Greeks used this formation in battle as well as how the soldiers were dressed and what their armor looked like. The hoplite formation is shown in different styles of pottery such as white ground and black figure and also on many different types of pottery such an \"olpe\", \"krater,\" \"alabastron\", and \"dinos\". Across all depictions, hoplite soldiers wear the same armor and carry the same weapons in the same position. In addition, the aspect of uniformity is emphasized in these representations.\n\nThe Chigi Vase is a Protocorinthian \"olpe\" and was made by the Chigi Painter from 650-640 BC. The Chigi Vase was discovered in an Etruscan tomb at Monte Aguzzo. It is black-figure style with an unusual use of polychromy. It contains the earliest known representation of the hoplite phalanx formation. The vase shows the moment that the two hoplite formations come in contact in battle. Each soldier is armed with a decorative round shield in their left hand and a long spear in their right as well as a helmet. Behind the soldiers is a flute player that may have been used to keep the hoplites marching correctly. The Chigi vase is arguably one of the most important representations of the Hoplite Soldier in Greek Art. The Chigi Vase gives historians as insight to how the phalanx formation was used in battle.\n\nThis Middle Corinthian perfume vase from 590–570 BC contains two friezes of the hoplite phalanx. The terracotta vase uses a form of black figure and is only 21.3 cm in height. Both friezes show hoplites with a circular shield in their left hand, spear in their right, as well as a typical hoplite helmet. All of the hoplites are faced in the same way and have about the same distance in between their feet. This could reflect the state of uniformity and the lack of individualism within hoplite warfare. The top frieze is interrupted by another figure who does not resemble a hoplite soldier. The rest of the vase is decorated with lines and dots, creating zones on the vase.\n\nThis Attic black figure Dinos now located in Musée du Louvre in Paris was made by \"The Louvre Painter\" in 560 BC. It contains three friezes. The first depicts Troilos and Polyxena at the fountain, a Centauromachy, the return of Hephaistos, and a symposium. The middle frieze shows a hoplite phalanx, and the bottom frieze shows a horse race. The frieze with the hoplites shows two hoplite formations engaging in battle. The hoplite in front of the first phalanx advances to the left over a body. Another hoplite extends his arm as he leans to throw he spear to the warrior in front of him. The warriors on foot all possess typical characteristics of hoplites with their spear and round shield as well as their helmet. In addition the hoplites are close to each other in proximity which is a feature of the phalanx formation.\n\nThis Calyx Krater was made in 530 BCE from Pharsala and uses the black figure stye. It is also painted in the manner of Exekias. The Calyx Krater depicts the scene a Four-horse chariot and a Homeric battle around the body of a dead warrior, that might be Patroklos. The main focus of the scene is on the two hoplites clashing in battle, behind each of them is a hoplite phalanx. This image gives insight into how two hoplite formations engaged in battle. The figures can be identified as hoplites because of their round shield in their left hand as well as their spear in the right hand.\n\nThe \"Dionysos with Satyr and Maenad Ababastron\" was made by the Haimon painter in 480 BC and it from the late Archaic period. It is attic black figure and white ground. The lower frieze represents a Gigantomachy. Herakles and Athena fight five giants, four of whom are represented as hoplites. The viewer can tell that the giants are hoplites because of the typical helmets, the round shield held in the left hand, and the spear in the right hand. One of the hoplite giants is on the ground to due to his fight with Athena. the others are attacking Herakles from behind.\n\nThis work of art is an interesting take on the typical Gigantomachy. The representation of the hoplite formation in this period hints that the Greeks were still using this formation in warfare. In addition, this alabastron is an example of the combination of a mythological battle (the Gigantomachy) and aspects of real battles (the hoplite formation) that we see in other examples of Greek Art, specifically the Temple of Athena Nike on the Akropolis and the Stoa Poikile on the Classical Agora.\n"}

It is a narrative where its conflict comes from characters not recognizing, or not being told, key information that would resolve the conflict, often because of plot contrivance. The only thing that prevents the conflict's resolution is the character's constant avoidance or obliviousness of it throughout the plot, even if it was already obvious to the viewer, so the characters are all \"idiots\" in that they are too obtuse to simply resolve the conflict immediately.\n\nReviewing \"Prime\" in 2005 critic Roger Ebert said \"I can forgive and even embrace an Idiot Plot in its proper place (consider Astaire and Rogers in \"Top Hat\"). But when the characters have depth and their decisions have consequences, I grow restless when their misunderstandings could be ended by words that the screenplay refuses to allow them to utter.\" Alternate formulations describe only the protagonist as being an idiot.\n\nScience fiction writer and critic Damon Knight, in his 1956 collection \"In Search of Wonder\", attributes the first use of the term to author James Blish. Knight went on to coin the term second-order idiot plot, \"in which not merely the principals, but everybody in the whole society has to be a grade-A idiot, or the story couldn't happen.\"\n\nWriting in 2013, author David Brin explored one variation of the idiot plot. In most adventure films and novels, the writers and directors have an imperative to keep their protagonists in jeopardy. This becomes difficult if they are surrounded by skilled professionals, paid to intervene and help if called. Hence, storytellers feel compelled to separate their characters from meaningful help, so that any assistance they receive is either late or else below the level of danger offered by the antagonists. The more powerful the villains, the more competent that help is allowed to be. \"But for the most part, institutions and your neighbors are portrayed as sheep, so that only the hero's actions truly matter.\"\n\n"}

In 2007 it was scheduled to feature in an itinerant exhibition of important pieces that the Louvre organised in the United States.\n\nThe mosaic is square in shape. The sides are long. Originally it was part of a large floor mosaic featuring five different images. It formed the floor of the dining room in a large . The Judgment of Paris was the central and largest image, with two others on each side. The other four are housed in other museums as follows:\n\nThe mosaic depicts the Judgment of Paris, one in a series of incidents which led to the Trojan War. Paris is shown seated in the middle of the scene, where he is required to determine which of the three goddesses, Hera, Athena or Aphrodite, is the most beautiful. The goddesses stand to the right. Over on the left Hermes watches: above him Psyche looks on from a rock, while on the right side, above and behind the divine contestants, Eros looks down from the top of an appropriately positioned pillar. The composition is framed with a rich floral pattern in which vine leaves feature prominently.\n\nThe archeologist-scholar Doro Levi saw a certain impressionistic effect in the work, especially in respect of the interplay between the light and the shadows. \"The Judgment of Paris\" was a popular theme in antiquity. Around six examples have been identified among the at Pompeii. Only two other surviving mosaic depictions have been found, however. These are on Kos and at Casariche in Spain.\n"}

It is located in Wrocław, Poland. The painting is one of only a few preserved relics of a genre of 19th-century mass culture, and the oldest in Poland. The panorama stands in a circular fashion and, with the viewer in the center, presents different scenes at various viewing angles. A special kind of perspective used in the painting and additional effects (lighting, artificial terrain) create a feeling of reality.\n\nThe idea came from the painter Jan Styka in Lviv who invited the renowned battle-painter Wojciech Kossak to participate in the project. They were assisted by Ludwik Boller, Tadeusz Popiel, Zygmunt Rozwadowski, Teodor Axentowicz, Włodzimierz Tetmajer, Wincenty Wodzinowski and Michał Sozański.\n\nThe project was conceived as a patriotic commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the victorious Battle of Racławice, a famous episode of the Kościuszko Insurrection, a heroic but ultimately failed attempt to defend Polish independence. The battle was fought on 4 April 1794 between the insurrectionist force of regulars and peasant volunteers (armed with scythes) under Kościuszko (1746–1817) himself and the Russian army commanded by General Alexander Tormasov. For the nation which had lost its independence, the memory of this glorious victory was particularly important.\n\nThe National Exhibition, organized in Lviv in 1894, offered an excellent opportunity to realize Styka’s idea. Canvas, woven to order, was bought in Brussels, the specially built rotunda’s iron structure (designed by Ludwik Ramułt) in Vienna. The rotunda, located in Stryjski Park in Lviv, was ready in July 1893. The huge panorama painting was executed within 9 months, between August 1893 and May 1894. The official opening was on 5 June 1894. Since the very beginning, Panorama of the Battle of Racławice attracted enormous attention and brought crowds of tourists to Lviv. On average 75 000 viewers visited it every year.\n\nAfter World War II, the painting was brought to Wrocław (formerly Breslau in Germany) along with a part of the collection of the Ossoliński Institution. As under the Communist regime the subject was considered politically sensitive, the efforts to have the canvas restored and exhibited, undertaken by successive Volunteer Committees, were successful only after August 1980. Reopened on 14 June 1985, the major attraction of the old Lviv has immediately become the main tourist attraction of Wrocław. Here, contemporary viewers have an opportunity to participate in a unique illusionist spectacle.\n\nAmong the many guests who have visited the panorama are Pope John Paul II; Beatrix, the Queen of the Netherlands; Czesław Miłosz, winner of the 1980 Nobel Prize for Literature. Franz Joseph I of Austria visited Racławice panorama 8 September 1894 and said \"Imposant. Es hat mich frappirt.\" Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen said about this painting, \"This is the most beautiful panorama I have ever seen.\"\n\n\n\n"}

It is associated with the belief that a god is the geometer of the world. The geometry used in the design and construction of religious structures such as churches, temples, mosques, religious monuments, altars, and tabernacles has sometimes been considered sacred. The concept applies also to sacred spaces such as temenoi, sacred groves, village greens and holy wells, and the creation of religious art.\n\nThe belief that a god created the universe according to a geometric plan has ancient origins. Plutarch attributed the belief to Plato, writing that \"Plato said god geometrizes continually\" (\"Convivialium disputationum\", liber 8,2). In modern times, the mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss adapted this quote, saying \"God arithmetizes\".\n\nAs late as Johannes Kepler (1571–1630), a belief in the geometric underpinnings of the cosmos persisted among some scientists.\n\nAccording to Stephen Skinner, the study of sacred geometry has its roots in the study of nature, and the mathematical principles at work therein. Many forms observed in nature can be related to geometry; for example, the chambered nautilus grows at a constant rate and so its shell forms a logarithmic spiral to accommodate that growth without changing shape. Also, honeybees construct hexagonal cells to hold their honey. These and other correspondences are sometimes interpreted in terms of sacred geometry and considered to be further proof of the natural significance of geometric forms.\n\nGeometric ratios, and geometric figures were often employed in the designs of ancient Egyptian, ancient Indian, Greek and Roman architecture. Medieval European cathedrals also incorporated symbolic geometry. Indian and Himalayan spiritual communities often constructed temples and fortifications on design plans of mandala and yantra.\n\nMany of the sacred geometry principles of the human body and of ancient architecture were compiled into the Vitruvian Man drawing by Leonardo da Vinci. The latter drawing was itself based on the much older writings of the Roman architect Vitruvius.\n\nIslamic geometric patterns are well known too, which are used in the Qu'ran, Mosques and even in the caligraphies of personal names.\n\nThe Agamas are a collection of Sanskrit, Tamil, and Grantha scriptures chiefly constituting the methods of temple construction and creation of idols, worship means of deities, philosophical doctrines, meditative practices, attainment of sixfold desires, and four kinds of yoga.\n\nElaborate rules are laid out in the Agamas for Shilpa (the art of sculpture) describing the quality requirements of such matters as the places where temples are to be built, the kinds of image to be installed, the materials from which they are to be made, their dimensions, proportions, air circulation, and lighting in the temple complex. The Manasara and Silpasara are works that deal with these rules. The rituals of daily worship at the temple also follow rules laid out in the Agamas.\n\nThe construction of Medieval European cathedrals was often based on geometries intended to make the viewer see the world through mathematics, and through this understanding, gain a better understanding of the divine. These churches frequently featured a Latin Cross floor-plan. \n\nAt the beginning of the Renaissance in Europe, views shifted to favor simple and regular geometries. The circle in particular became a central and symbolic shape for the base of buildings, as it represented the perfection of nature and the centrality of man's place in the universe. The use of the circle and other simple and symmetrical geometric shapes was solidified as a staple of Renaissance religious architecture in Leon Battista Alberti's architectural treatise, which described the ideal church in terms of spiritual geometry.\n\nStephen Skinner discusses the tendency of some writers to place a geometric diagram over virtually any image of a natural object or human created structure, find some lines intersecting the image and declare it based on sacred geometry. If the geometric diagram does not intersect major physical points in the image, the result is what Skinner calls \"unanchored geometry\".\n\n\n\n"}

Although Gossaert's name is signed on the border of Balthazar's richly embroidered headdress, and on a collar worn by Balthazar's turbaned attendant, the painting was occasionally attributed to Albrecht Dürer in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 2010, Ainsworth suggested that the work was a collaboration between Gossaert and Gerard David.\n\nIn the centre of the painting, the Madonna and child sit in the ruins of a building, receiving a gift from the kneeling Caspar to the right; the Christ-child holds a gold coin in his left hand, almost as if he were offering Caspar a communion wafer. Six shepherds, an ass and a cow watch from behind, with a grey-bearded Joseph – depicted in a bright red robe, contrasting with Mary's traditional garb of deep blue – standing behind a column to the left. More shepherds and their flock are barely visible in the distance.\n\nTo the right of Caspar stands Melchior holding aloft his gift, accompanied by four attendants, with more attendants approaching from the distance on horseback. Balthazar stands to the left with his gift and three attendants. Balthazar's richly decorated crown is inscribed with his name at its peak and Gossaert's name towards the bottom; Gossaert's name also appears on a collar worn by Balthazar's turbaned black attendant. Further left, two more attendants in exotic dress watch from a window.\n\nNine angels (perhaps representing the nine orders of angels) look down through the structure of the ruined building, one holding a scroll bearing the words \"Gloria in excelcis deo\". A bird – symbolising the Holy Spirit – hovers above, while the Star of Bethlehem shines brightly at the top of the painting. Several babies appear as decorative details, in the architectural frieze and the capitals, and on the golden vessel for Balthazar's gift. A tenth angel – possibly a self-portrait of Gossaert – is barely visible, in a doorway behind the ox.\n\nThe work was painted on a wooden panel consisting of six oak boards, laid vertically, measuring high by wide. The paint was applied to a ground of chalk fixed with animal glue, with a thin priming layer of lead white mixed with a little lead-tin-yellow. There is much underdrawing, visible in some areas due to the paint having become more transparent. A number of details were added at a late stage, over areas previously painted, including the two figures at the window to the left; the ox and the ass; the two shepherds behind the ass and the shepherds in the distance; Joseph's stick; Caspar's sceptre and the lid of Caspar's goblet.\n\nGossaert's composition draws from several sources. It takes its main inspiration from the Monforte altarpiece by Hugo van der Goes (Gemäldegalerie, Staatliche Museen, Berlin), which has a similar grouping of richly dressed Mary and Magi among ruined architecture, with their attendants and bystanders, and glimpses of the landscape behind and angels above. The two dogs in the foreground, on a floor with many broken tiles, are copied from other engravings: one taken from the lower right corner of Dürer's engraving of Saint Eustace and the second is a reflection of the dog in an engraving of the \"Adoration of the Kings\" by Martin Schongauer. Other elements are drawn from other prints by Schongauer and Dürer.\n\nThe origins of the painting are unclear. It may have been commissioned by David of Burgundy, Bishop of Utrecht from 1456 to 1496, or his half-brother, Philip of Burgundy, who was Bishop from 1517 to 1524. Lorne Campbell argues that the painting was commissioned by Daniel van Boechout, Lord of Boerlare and Beverweerd, as the altarpiece of the Lady Chapel of the Benedictine Abbey of St Adrian in Geraardsbergen, in East Flanders, south of Ghent and west of Brussels, where it first enters the historical record in 1600. It was bought by the rulers of the Habsburg Netherlands, Albert and Isabella, in 1601, who had seen it at the abbey the previous year. They paid £2,100 to the abbot, and moved the painting to become the altar of the chapel of their palace in Brussels. The palace was destroyed by a fire in February 1731, but the chapel and its contents survived. The chapel was demolished in the 1770s, but the painting had already been removed by the Governor of the Austrian Netherlands, Charles of Lorraine. It was sold after Charles' death in 1781 to Emmanuel-Marie de Cock, Pensionary of Brussels and Greffier-Pensionary of the States of Brabant.\n\nA painting matching its description came to London in 1787 and was sold at an auction held in London by John Greenwood the following year. It came into the possession of art dealer Michael Bryan by 1795, and was sold to Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle, who displayed it at Castle Howard. It was restored in 1884 by William Morrill, and then moved to Naworth Castle.\n\nGeorge Howard, 9th Earl of Carlisle served as a Trustee of the National Gallery for more than 30 years, and offered to sell the painting to the National Gallery shortly before his death in 1911. His widow honoured his wishes, and the painting was bought by the gallery later in 1911. The £40,000 purchase price was funded by an advance of the gallery's annual purchase grant and other gallery funds, with contributions from The Art Fund, Edward Tennant, 1st Baron Glenconner, Edward Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh, Alfred de Rothschild, and George Curzon, Earl (later Marquess) Curzon of Kedleston. The gallery published a monograph by Maurice W. Brockwell to commemorate the acquisition – the first such publication by the gallery.\n\nCopies are held by the Museo Nacional de San Carlos in Mexico City, the Wittelsbacher Ausgleichfonds in Munich, the church of St John the Baptist in Nethen, the National Gallery in Prague, and the Tula Art Museum.\n\n"}

{"id": "47635166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47635166", "title": "Tiffany Doggett", "text": "Tiffany Doggett\n\nTiffany \"Pennsatucky\" Doggett is a fictional character in the Netflix series \"Orange Is the New Black\", portrayed by Taryn Manning. Manning was offered the role without needing to audition. The character of Doggett is based on a real-life prisoner, a \"young woman from western Pennsylvania who proudly called herself a redneck\". She is originally from Waynesboro, Virginia. Prior to her imprisonment, she is shown to be exchanging sexual favors for soda or money. Doggett is also known to have had five abortions. She is charged with shooting an abortion doctor and decides to hire a Christian lawyer; the ensuing support she receives from Christian groups leads to Doggett's becoming a born-again Christian.\n\nDoggett makes her first appearance in Season 1, episode 5 and initially is the main antagonist but becomes a protagonist in later seasons. In her debut episode, she unsuccessfully attempts to hang up a cross in the prison chapel and expresses homophobic views. She conflicts with Alex Vause and Piper Chapman throughout the first season. In the second season, Doggett's storyline revolves around her friendships with Sam Healy and Carrie \"Big Boo\" Black. This friendship with Big Boo continues into the third season. Big Boo comforts Doggett when the latter is feeling remorse for her abortions and when she is raped by a correctional officer. The character Doggett and her storylines have received mixed reviews from critics, though Manning's performance has received critical acclaim.\n\nTiffany Doggett's nickname \"Pennsatucky\" is derived from Pennsyltucky; a slang term for the rural portions of Pennsylvania. The author, Piper Kerman, of the book, \"\", which inspired \"Orange is the New Black\" describes the real life version of Pennsatucky as \"a young woman from western Pennsylvania who proudly called herself a redneck\". Kerman further describes her as someone addicted to crack cocaine and dealing with the loss of custody of her child.\n\nTaryn Manning, already an established actress, did not have to audition for the role of Doggett and was offered it. Manning, when speaking about this to Joshua Rotter of Download.com, said that she immediately accepted the offer \"I loved it and didn't need to look any further. I was sold.\" To prepare for the role, Manning did some research on faith healing and evangelistic ceremonies. She also states that her inspiration for Doggett at least partly comes from the White family in the 2009 documentary film \"The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia\". The only make-up that Manning wears for her role as Doggett, in the first season, is on her teeth to create the effect of receding gums and missing teeth. From the second season onwards, however, Doggett has false teeth in place and so the teeth seen are Manning's own.\n\nDoggett is from Waynesboro, Virginia. After Doggett has her first period, her mother gives her advice about sex: \"go on and let them [referring to men] do their business.\" This leads to her, later in life, to have sex with men in exchange for soda or money. Her perspective of sex changes when she meets Nathan. Jonathon Dornbush, of \"Entertainment Weekly\" writes \"[Nathan] wants them both to enjoy the experience [of sex], and it opens Tiffany's perception of relationships.\" Nathan and his family move away, causing their relationship to end, and, almost immediately afterwards, Doggett is raped by an ex-boyfriend.\n\nDoggett has had five abortions. After having her fifth abortion, which takes place at an abortion clinic in Fishersville, Virginia, the nurse remarks \"we should give you a punch card, get the sixth one free.\" Doggett is so offended by this joke that she shoots the nurse with a shotgun. She agrees to have a Christian lawyer as it was likely to lead to a lighter sentence and her legal bills being paid for. Since she shot an abortion nurse, she became a 'hero' of the pro-life movement. Doggett regularly receives cards praising her for her claims of defending the unborn as well as generous cash donations to her commissary account by fans & supporters. Although her Christian faith was initially fake, at some point Doggett did become a Christian; this was confirmed by Manning in an interview. Manning describes Doggett's faith as \"a hybrid of Christianity, Baptism, Presbyterian\".\n\nDoggett first appears in the fifth episode. She wishes to hang up a cross in Litchfield Penitentiary's chapel but is refused permission. She ignores this and hangs her cross up on a light fixture; this causes the entire fixture to fall down and hence damages the chapel's ceiling. She also displays transphobia; calling the transgender woman Sophia Burset (played by Laverne Cox) an 'abomination' and 'it' and blaming her for the damage to the chapel. Doggett has numerous clashes with Alex Vause (played by Laura Prepon); firstly Vause threatens to rape Doggett after growing tired of her complaining about Piper Chapman (played by Taylor Schilling); Doggett locks Vause in a dryer while she is helping Chapman to fix it and, lastly, Doggett snitches on Chapman and Vause for dancing provocatively with each other; resulting in Chapman being placed in solitary confinement.\n\nChapman and Vause get revenge on Doggett and trick her into believing that she has faith healing powers, eventually culminating in her being sent to the psychiatric ward. Although Chapman aids in Doggett's release from the psychiatric ward, Doggett still bears a grudge against her. Doggett's lawyer encourages her to evangelize to Chapman instead and this leads to Chapman 'converting' but then refusing to be baptized. Doggett sees this as disrespectful and expresses a wish to kill Chapman. The two have a confrontation at the end of the season's final episode. Doggett attacks Chapman with a shiv made from a wooden cross; Chapman throws Doggett to the ground and hits her repeatedly.\n\nIt is revealed in the third episode that Suzanne Warren (played by Uzo Aduba) is also involved in the fight at the end of season one. She punches Chapman in the face twice and knocks her unconscious (Doggett is already unconscious at this stage). This gives the impression that Doggett and Chapman were evenly matched and therefore equally responsible. Following Doggett's return to full health, she finds that her previous best friends, Leanne Taylor (played by Emma Myles) and Angie Rice (played by Julie Lake), no longer want to be associated with her. This leaves Doggett seeking prison counsellor Sam Healy (played by Michael J. Harney) for comfort.\n\nFollowing her friendships with Taylor and Rice continuing to deteriorate, Doggett forms friendships with Healy and Carrie \"Big Boo\" Black (played by Lea DeLaria). Healy and Doggett unite to form \"Safe Place\", a therapy group where prisoners can share their feelings in a confidential and supportive environment. \"Safe Place\" is short-lived, however, and Healy decides to cancel the group indefinitely after Doggett fails to attend one of the sessions; when he investigates her reason for non-attendance, he finds her getting a hair cut from Burset. Doggett initially talks to Big Boo, an openly lesbian inmate, during a blackout in the prison as she believes that there is a secret 'gay agenda' and she believes that Big Boo will give her the answers that she is seeking. Doggett's physical appearance also changes in this season; she has white false teeth, neater hair and her skin looks smoother.\n\nIn the first episode, Big Boo and Doggett's friendship continues to develop. Seeing that Doggett bears strong feelings of guilt relating to the five abortions that she has had, Big Boo makes reference to the book \"Freakonomics\", which suggests that crime rates in the 1990s fell because of \"Roe v. Wade\". Following Lorna Morello (played by Yael Stone) being relieved of her duty of driving the prison van, the role is given to Doggett. She comes into contact with one of the new correctional officers called Charlie Coates (played by James McMenamin). Coates is initially friendly towards Doggett. Despite relationships between prison staff and prisoners being forbidden, Coates kisses Doggett, against her will, after feeding some ducks. Following another outing, Coates gets in trouble with his boss Joe Caputo (Nick Sandow) for being late for count and is placed on probation. Doggett apologises for having caused him trouble, but nevertheless he rapes her in the back of the prison van.\n\nWhen Big Boo learns of the rape, she encourages Doggett to take revenge on Coates by making him unconscious and then raping him with a broomstick. Whilst they successfully drug Coates, neither of them are willing to violate him. In order to end contact with Coates, Doggett fakes a seizure on her next outing with him and is declared unfit for driving a van. She is replaced as prison van driver by another inmate, Maritza Ramos (played by Diane Guerrero).\n\nCoates approaches Doggett in the fourth episode of season 4; Doggett responds in a manner that shows clearly that she is still affected by the rape. This is also the first time that Doggett openly refers to the incident as a 'rape'. Coates is seen to be visibly distressed by this. Towards the middle of the season, it is shown that Coates finally apologizes to Doggett and she, clearly surprised and relieved, forgives him and goes on to tell Big Boo about what happened. Big Boo, still furious about the rape, refuses to accept Doggett's decision, straining their friendship. In the twelfth episode of the season, Doggett explains to Big Boo the reasons why she decided to forgive Coates: \"Pain is always there... but suffering is a choice\". The two resume their friendship following this.\n\nIn \"Toast Can Never Be Bread Again\", as Doggett and Big Boo are assigned to cover the cafeteria following the death of Poussey Washington (played by Samira Wiley), Coates is also there to watch over the body. Coates then tells Doggett that he needs to quit because he hates how awful the prison is becoming. She tells him she does not want him to go, since they are on good terms, and she likes talking to him, despite what happened. She kisses him and Coates makes it clear that he wants to go further than this but chooses not to, reasoning \"I don't want to ruin where we are now\".\n\nDoggett was widely perceived to have been the series' main antagonist in its first season. She was seen to be homophobic and racist; one \"Cosmopolitan\" critic described her as 'vile'. A critic for \"TV Insider\" described the first season Doggett as \"terrifying, manipulative and so entirely unlikable\" but also \"hypnotic to watch\". Horatia Harrod's review in the \"Daily Telegraph\" described Manning's portrayal of Doggett as \"brilliantly unhinged\". Other critics have praised the character, especially in the final episode of season one; calling her \"fantastic\", a \"solid character\" and \"one of the best characters on the show\". Some also felt that Manning's performance was worthy of an Emmy nomination.\n\nFollowing the release of the first season of \"Orange is the New Black\", Doggett received some criticism from different media. Writing for \"The American Conservative\", B. D. McClay claimed that Doggett was a poor and inaccurate representation of American Christians; \"Pennsatucky is such an aggressively terrible character\" and \"her faith is neither well-understood nor well-drawn\". Laura Leonard of \"Christianity Today\", supports Clay's view and goes further to say \"it was frustrating to see this one painful narrative represent Christian faith on \"OITNB\", a show that masters other aspects of the melting pot so well\", speaking about Doggett's background story and conflict with Chapman. Two critics for \"The A.V. Club\" also gave negative reviews of Doggett; Todd VanDerWerff says that \"Pennsatucky never really comes together as a character in the same way as some of the others on the show\" and Myles McNutt opted to criticize the storyline of the final episode of the first season specifically, saying that it \"[treats] her like a cartoon villain instead of a real character\". Betsy Leondar-Wright accused the series' creators of classism and said that Doggett was an \"outrageous Redneck stereotype\".\n\nDoggett's rape storyline in the third season garnered much reaction, both positive and negative. Jada Yuan of \"Vulture\" described the rape scenes (both the one in the flashback and the one involving correctional officer Coates) as \"heartbreaking\" and praised episode director Jesse Peretz's decision to keep the camera focused on Manning during the scenes. Megan Vick praised the 'transformation' of the character of Doggett, calling it \"the season's breakout storyline and performance\". McNutt, who had been critical of Doggett in the first season, spoke positively about the rape storyline.\n\nMarissa Higgins, writing for xoJane, contended that the show \"didn't accomplish anything with their portrayal of sexual assault\" and said that she disliked the way that the story ended with Doggett effectively quitting her job as van driver in order to avoid further contact with Coates. Emma Eisenberg, of \"Salon\", criticized the scenes depicting Doggett growing up in Waynesboro as being \"riddled with excessive Appalachian clichés\". She went further by calling Doggett's mother unrealistic in her attitude towards sex: \"the mothers I met [near Waynesboro] wanted their daughters to understand sex and to make informed choices\". Eisenberg claimed that, therefore, Doggett's mother's speech about sex − \"it's like a bee sting, in and out, over before you knew it was happening\" − was not representative of people in Waynesboro at that time. Chloe Stillwell completely disagreed with Eisenberg and insisted that the character of Doggett was realistic: \"Eisenberg's argument completely misses the point that perhaps the show is trying to be as real as possible, and acknowledging that there are real life Pennsatuckies in this world isn't to disenfranchise Appalachia.\"\n\n"}

Accepting the award, Redgrave thanked Hollywood for having \"refused to be intimidated by the threats of a small bunch of Zionist hoodlums – whose behavior is an insult to the stature of Jews all over the world and to their great and heroic record of struggle against fascism and oppression.\"\n\nHer remarks brought an outraged on-stage response from screenwriter and Academy Award presenter Paddy Chayefsky, and sparked controversy. One Redgrave biography noted that \"The scandal of her awards speech and the negative press it occasioned had a destructive effect on her acting opportunities that would last for years to come.\"\n\nLater film roles include those of suffragist Olive Chancellor in \"The Bostonians\" (1984, a fourth Best Actress Academy Award nomination), transsexual tennis player Renée Richards in \"Second Serve\" (1986), Blanche Hudson in the television remake of \"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane\" (1991), Mrs. Wilcox in \"Howards End\" (1992, her sixth Academy Award nomination, this time in a supporting role); crime boss Max in \"\" (1996, when discussing the role of Max, Brian DePalma and Tom Cruise thought it would be fun to cast an actor like Redgrave; they then decided to go with the real thing); Oscar Wilde’s mother in \"Wilde\" (1997); Clarissa Dalloway in \"Mrs. Dalloway\" (1997); and Dr. Sonia Wick in \"Girl, Interrupted\" (1999).

She ran for parliament several times as a party member but never received more than a few hundred votes.\n\nRedgrave made her American TV debut as concentration camp survivor Fania Fénelon in the Arthur Miller-scripted TV movie \"Playing for Time\" (1980), a part for which she won an Emmy as Outstanding Lead Actress in 1981. The decision to cast Redgrave as Fénelon was, however, a source of controversy. In light of Redgrave's support for the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), Fénelon objected to her casting. Redgrave defended her stance in her 1991 autobiography, saying that \"the struggle against antisemitism and for the self-determination of the Palestinians form a single whole.\"\n\nIn 1984, Redgrave sued the Boston Symphony Orchestra, claiming that the orchestra had fired her from a performance because of her support of the PLO. Lillian Hellman testified in court on Redgrave's behalf. Redgrave won on a count of breach of contract, but did not win on the claim that the Boston orchestra had violated her civil rights by firing her.\n\nIn 1995, Redgrave was elected to serve as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.\n\nIn December 2002, Redgrave paid £50,000 bail for Chechen separatist Deputy Premier and special envoy Akhmed Zakayev, who had sought political asylum in the United Kingdom and was accused by the Russian government of aiding and abetting hostage-takings in the Moscow Hostage Crisis of 2002 and guerrilla warfare against Russia.\n\nAt a press conference, Redgrave said she feared for Zakayev's safety if he were extradited to Russia on terrorism charges. He would \"die of a heart attack\" or some other mysterious explanation offered by Russia, she said. On 13 November 2003, a London court rejected the Russian government's request for Zakayev's extradition. Instead, the court accepted a plea by lawyers for Zakayev that he would not get a fair trial, and could even face torture, in Russia. \"It would be unjust and oppressive to return Mr Zakayev to Russia,\" Judge Timothy Workman ruled.\n\nIn 2004, Vanessa Redgrave and her brother Corin Redgrave launched the Peace and Progress Party, which campaigned against the Iraq War and for human rights. However, in June 2005 Redgrave left the party.\n\nRedgrave has been an outspoken critic of the \"war on terrorism\". During a June 2005 interview on \"Larry King Live\", Redgrave was challenged on this criticism and on her political views. In response she questioned whether there can be true democracy if the political leadership of the United States and Britain does not \"uphold the values for which my father's generation fought the Nazis, [and] millions of people gave their lives against the Soviet Union's regime. [Such sacrifice was made] because of democracy and what democracy meant: no torture, no camps, no detention forever or without trial... [Such] techniques are not just alleged [against the governments of the U.S. and Britain], they have actually been written about by the FBI. I don't think it's being 'far left'...to uphold the rule of law.\"\n\nIn March 2006, Redgrave remarked in an interview with US broadcast journalist Amy Goodman: \"I don't know of a single government that actually abides by international human rights law, not one, including my own. In fact, [they] violate these laws in the most despicable and obscene way, I would say.\" Goodman's interview with Redgrave took place in the actress's West London home on the evening of 7 March, and covered a range of subjects, particularly the cancellation by the New York Theatre Workshop of the Alan Rickman production \"My Name is Rachel Corrie\". Such a development, said Redgrave, was an \"act of catastrophic cowardice\" as \"the essence of life and the essence of theatre is to communicate about lives, either lives that have ended or lives that are still alive, [and about] beliefs, and what is in those beliefs.\"\n\nIn June 2006, she was awarded a lifetime achievement award from the Transilvania International Film Festival, one of whose sponsors is a mining company named Gabriel Resources. She dedicated the award to a community organisation from Roşia Montană, Romania, which is campaigning against a gold mine that Gabriel Resources is seeking to build near the village. Gabriel Resources placed an \"open letter\" in \"The Guardian\" on 23 June 2006, attacking Redgrave, arguing the case for the mine, and exhibiting support for it among the inhabitants: the open letter is signed by 77 villagers.\n\nIn December 2007, Redgrave was named as one of the possible suretors who paid the £50,000 bail for Jamil al-Banna, one of three British residents arrested after landing back in the UK following four years' captivity at Guantanamo Bay. Redgrave has declined to be specific about her financial involvement but said she was \"very happy\" to be of \"some small assistance for Jamil and his wife\", adding, \"It is a profound honour and I am glad to be alive to be able to do this. Guantanamo Bay is a concentration camp.\"\n\nIn March 2014, Redgrave took part in a protest outside Pentonville Prison in North London after new prison regulations were introduced which forbade sending books to prisoners. She and fellow actor Samuel West, playwright David Hare and Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy took turns reading poetry and making speeches. Redgrave stated that the ban was \"vicious and deplorable...Literature is something that stirs us beyond our immediate problems, it can help us to learn better our own problems, our own faults or to have a goal to live for, an aspiration.\" The ban was overturned by the Ministry of Justice the following December.\n\nIn 2017 Redgrave made her directorial debut with the movie \"Sea Sorrow\", a documentary about the European migrant crisis and the plight of migrants encamped outside Calais, France trying to reach Britain. She has heavily criticized the exclusionary policy of the British government towards refugees, stating that the British Government \"...has violated these principles (of the Declaration of Human Rights) and it continues to do so, which I find deeply shameful. The UN signed the Declaration of Human Rights and now we have to employ lawyers to take the government to court to force them to obey the law. Just thinking about that makes my mind go berserk.”\n\n"}

There are various versions of the lyrics, which relate to a pilgrimage site, suppressed during the English Reformation.\n\nThe tune provided inspiration for Elizabethan composers, notably William Byrd. Byrd wrote a set of keyboard variations called Have with Yow to Walsingame (\"Be off to Walsingham\"). In some sources it is called \"As I went to Walsingham\", the first line of the following quatrain.\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em;\">As I went to Walsingham,\nTo the shrine with speed,\nMet I with a jolly palmer\nIn a pilgrim's weed.</poem>\n\nWalsingham is a pilgrimage site in Norfolk, England, where, according to Catholic belief, a Saxon noblewoman, Richeldis de Faverches, had a vision of the Virgin Mary. \nThe shrine was dismantled in 1538 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. (It has since been revived). In the sixteenth century attitudes towards pilgrimages varied, reflecting the Catholic/Protestant divide.\n\nThe ballad literature includes on the one hand laments for the lost shrine and, on the other, suggestions that, as alleged by religious reformers, pilgrims were looking for encounters of a sexual nature. Ophelia in \"Hamlet\" sings a version of the Walsingham lyrics in which a woman asks about her pilgrim lover.\n\nByrd composed 22 variations on the Walsingham tune. The composition takes about 9 or 10 minutes in performance. It is included in two of the most important collections of keyboard music of the Renaissance, \"My Ladye Nevells Booke\" and the \"Fitzwilliam Virginal Book\".\nIn these variations, which Byrd wrote in the 1570s or 1580s, he shows his mastery of the keyboard, but also includes elements more characteristic of his vocal music.\n\nMusicologist Margaret Gynn described how Byrd had taken what was originally \"a love-song of the road\" and transformed it by giving it the \"serious religious character of a pilgrimage\".\nAccording to Bradley Brookshire, the variations form a sort of \"covert speech\" addressed to Catholic recusants in Elizabethan culture. He argues that it includes \"musically encoded symbols of Catholic veneration and lament.\"\n\nByrd's younger rival John Bull also composed variations on Walsingham for keyboard. It is the first composition in the \"Fitzwilliam Virginal Book\", and with 30 variations is longer than Byrd's version.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55517319", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55517319", "title": "Wetterau Limes", "text": "Wetterau Limes\n\nThe Wetterau Limes is the name given in the field of historical research to that part of the Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes which enclosed the region that became known later as the Wetterau in the German state of Hesse.\n\nDuring the two campaigns of the Roman Emperor Domitian against the Chatti (83 and 85 AD), the Romans began to cut swathes of open ground through the dense forests of today's Hesse, in order to prevent their columns from being ambushed (e.g. at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest).\n\nOn the crest of the Taunus mountain range, such a swathe served as a supply and surveillance route. After the end of the Chatti Wars, the Romans began to secure these conquered regions east of the Rhine with a \"limes\" - a line of forts, fortlets, watchtowers and palisades. The forest road was guarded by wooden watchtowers to ensure continuous observation. This ensured that the southern slopes of the Taunus mountains and the fertile and strategically important Wetterau became part of the Roman Empire. In addition to the establishment of this frontier, Domitian turned the two Germanic military territories of Upper and Lower Germanian into Roman provinces. In spite of this rather modest conquest, he was subsequently celebrated in Rome with great pomp as a triumphator and coins were minted with the ambitious claim \"Germania capta\" (\"Germania is conquered\"). The propaganda nature of this policy is also evinced by the fact that in the very narrow province of Upper Germania (Germania superior) there were hardly any Germanii, the area was populated almost entirely by Celts.\n\nThe long-held conviction that the Neckar-Odenwald Limes was erected at the same time as the Wetterau Limes, immediately after the Chatti wars, is now regarded as having been rejected. Although there were Roman military outposts on the eastern side of the Rhine from the seventies, the border running along the Odenwald-Neckar Line to Donnstetten (see Lautertal Limes) is now dated by most sources as having not been erected before 98 AD.\n\nThe state of preservation of the \"limes\" is poor due to the heavy agricultural use of the Wetterau. Only a few sections on the foothills of the Taunus, at Echzell, Limeshain and east of Hanau are visible above ground. In the early days of limes research, this situation meant that the eastern Wetterau section remained undiscovered; it was assumed that a stretch of the limes ran through the Vogelsberg instead. This was not disproved until the 1880s by excavations of the \"Hanauer Geschichtsverein\" under Albert Duncker and Georg Wolff.\n\nLike the other sections of the Upper German-Raetian Limes, the Wetterau Limes was gradually reinforced and expanded. Particularly in the eastern Wetterau the dates when the individual forts were first built are not uniform. It is clear that there was initially a defensive line from Oberflorstadt via Heldenbergen and Hanau-Mittelbuchen to Hanau-Salisberg The forts on the line further east from Marköbel via Rückingen to Großkrotzenburg were probably not built until the time of Trajan. The neighbouring Taunus line was reinforced in the second half of the second century by the numerus forts of Holzhausen, Kleiner Feldberg and Kapersburg.\n\nThe further expansion of the \"limes\" defences to the north of the Wetterau was in order to protect its fertile soils on the one hand and to meet the high demand for the supply of the troops stationed on the \"limes\" and legion camps in Mainz (Mogontiacum). Archaeobotanical studies have calculated that an annual requirement of 3,034 tons of grain (excluding seed production) and 10,371 tons of hay were required to supply for the north-facing bulge of the \"limes\" in the Wetterau.\n\nThe end of the Wetterau Limes came in the year 259-260 AD, when Rome abandoned all areas to the east of the Rhine (the \"Limesfall\" or \"fall of the limes\"). Thus, for example, the pottery trade, once flourishing in the Wetterau, largely came to a standstill. Imports of pottery from the Rhineland dominate archaeological collections from the second third of the 3rd century. Even bricks found in the area do not seem to have been fired as they used to be. More and more often, (sometimes damaged) older building material was used instead. Hypocaust heating was replaced by much simpler heating pipe systems. From the border area, however, there are also other interesting finds which shed further light on the later period of the \"limes\". This includes the treasure of Ober-Florstadt, which was probably concealed during the course of Germanic invasions in AD 233. In 1603, the inscription of a \"collegium iuventutis\" was discovered in the area around Altenstadt Roman Fort. This may have been a unit set up to act as a local militia. Kapersburg Roman Fort was considerably reduced during its last days. There is also evidence of a local unit, a \"numberus nidensium\", which was presumably raised in the \"civitas\" capital of Nida-Heddernheim.\n\n\nThe following museums have a permanent exhibition on the Wetterau Limes or individual sites along it:\n\n\n\n"}
