Artwork that reshapes the natural world for expressive purposes is called abstract; that which derives from, but does not imitate a recognizable subject is called nonobjective abstraction. In the 20th century the trend toward abstraction coincided with advances in science, technology, and changes in urban life, eventually reflecting an interest in psychoanalytic theory. Later still, abstraction was manifest in more purely formal terms, such as color, freedom from objective context, and a reduction of form to basic geometric designs and shapes.\n\nIn music, the term \"abstraction\" can be used to describe improvisatory approaches to interpretation, and may sometimes indicate abandonment of tonality. Atonal music has no key signature, and is characterized by the exploration of internal numeric relationships.\n"}

{"id": "2433094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2433094", "title": "Apollonius of Tyre", "text": "Apollonius of Tyre\n\nApollonius of Tyre is the subject of an ancient short novella, popular in the Middle Ages. Existing in numerous forms in many languages, the text is thought to be translated from an ancient Greek manuscript, now lost.\n\nIn most versions, the eponymous hero is hunted and persecuted after he reveals Antiochus of Antioch's incestuous relationship with his daughter. After many travels and adventures, in which Apollonius loses both his wife and his daughter and thinks them both dead, he is eventually reunited with his family through unlikely circumstances or intercession by gods. In some English versions Apollonius is shipwrecked and becomes a tutor to a princess who falls in love with him, and the good king gradually discovers his daughter's wishes. The major themes are the punishment of inappropriate lust—the incestuous king invariably comes to a bad end—and the ultimate rewards of love and fidelity.\n\nThe story is first mentioned in Latin by Venantius Fortunatus in his \"Carmina\" (Bk. vi. 8, 11. 5–6) during the late 6th century; it is conjectured, based on similarities with the \"Ephesian Tale\" of Xenophon of Ephesus and the presence of idioms awkward in Latin but typical in Greek, that the original was a Greek romance of the third century. Some fragments of Greek romance, however, point to the possibility of an even older date. The earliest manuscripts of the tale, in a Latin version, date from the 9th or 10th century but are from late antiquity. Thus they show an intersection of Greek and Roman as well as pre-Christian and Christian influences. Overall, the work is classed with other ancient Greek romance novels.\n\nSome scholars hold that the riddles with which the king tests the hero in many versions may be a later addition: ten derive from the c. fourth-century Latin riddle-collection attributed to Symphosius. Other scholars believe the incest story to have been a later addition as well, though others, including Elizabeth Archibald, see it as an integral thematic element of the tale.\n\nThe most widespread Latin versions are those of Gottfried von Viterbo, who incorporated it into his \"Pantheon\" of 1185 as if it were actual history, \"Historia Apollonii regis Tyri\" and a version in the \"Gesta Romanorum\".\n\n'Fifty to a hundred versions' of the story are known from antiquity into the early modern period, mostly European, including texts in English, Dutch, German, Danish, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Russian, Hungarian, Greek, and Latin.\n\nThe earliest vernacular translation is an incomplete Old English prose text from the 11th century, sometimes called the first English novel. The existence of this unique text is unusual, as secular prose fiction from that time is extremely rare. The manuscript copy may only have survived because it was bound into a book together with Archbishop Wulfstan's homilies. Various versions of the tale were later written in most European languages.\n\nA notable English version is in the eighth book of John Gower's \"Confessio Amantis\" (1390), which uses it as an exemplum against lust. It is described as being based on \"Pantheon\", but it contains many details that work does not but the old \"Historia\" does.\n\nIts numerous vernacular versions, along with the Latin ones, attest to its popularity throughout the Middle Ages. It appears in an old Danish ballad collected in \"Danmarks gamle Folkeviser\".\n\nRobert Copland translated from the French the romance of \"Kynge Appolyne of Thyre\" (W. de Worde, 1510).\n\nThe story was retold in thirteenth-century Castilian as \"Libro de Apolonio\".\n\nRobert Copland wrote an early 16th-century prose version.\n\nShakespeare's play \"Pericles, Prince of Tyre\" was based in part on Gower's version, with the change of name probably inspired by Philip Sidney's \"Arcadia\". \"Apollonius of Tyre\" was also a source for his plays \"Twelfth Night\" and \"The Comedy of Errors\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1569785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1569785", "title": "Arcadia (utopia)", "text": "Arcadia (utopia)\n\nArcadia () refers to a vision of pastoralism and harmony with nature. The term is derived from the Greek province of the same name which dates to antiquity; the province's mountainous topography and sparse population of pastoralists later caused the word \"Arcadia\" to develop into a poetic byword for an idyllic vision of unspoiled wilderness. Arcadia is a poetic shaped space associated with bountiful natural splendor and harmony. The 'Garden' is often inhabited by shepherds. The concept also figures in Renaissance mythology. Although commonly thought of as being in line with Utopian ideals, Arcadia differs from that tradition in that it is more often specifically regarded as unattainable. Furthermore, it is seen as a lost, Edenic form of life, contrasting to the progressive nature of Utopian desires.\n\nThe inhabitants were often regarded as having continued to live after the manner of the Golden Age, without the pride and avarice that corrupted other regions. It is also sometimes referred to in English poetry as Arcady. The inhabitants of this region bear an obvious connection to the figure of the noble savage, both being regarded as living close to nature, uncorrupted by civilization, and virtuous.\n\nAccording to Greek mythology, Arcadia of Peloponnesus was the domain of Pan, a virgin wilderness home to the god of the forest and his court of dryads, nymphs and other spirits of nature. It was one version of paradise, though only in the sense of being the abode of supernatural entities, not an afterlife for deceased mortals.\n\nGreek mythology inspired the Roman poet Virgil to write his \"Eclogues\", a series of poems set in Arcadia.\n\nArcadia has remained a popular artistic subject since antiquity, both in visual arts and literature. Images of beautiful nymphs frolicking in lush forests have been a frequent source of inspiration for painters and sculptors. As a result of the influence of Virgil in medieval European literature (see, for example, \"Divine Comedy\"), \"Arcadia\" became a symbol of pastoral simplicity. European Renaissance writers (for instance, the Spanish poet Garcilaso de la Vega) often revisited the theme, and the name came to apply to any idyllic location or paradise. Unlike the word \"utopia\" (named for Thomas More's book, \"Utopia)\", \"Arcadia\" does not carry the connotation of a human civilization; Arcadia is presented as the spontaneous result of life lived naturally, uncorrupted by civilization.\n\nOf particular note is \"Et in Arcadia ego\" by Nicholas Poussin, which has become famous both in its own right and because of its (possible) connection with the gnostic histories of the Rosicrucians. In 1502 Jacopo Sannazaro published his long poem \"Arcadia\" that fixed the Early Modern perception of Arcadia as a lost world of idyllic bliss, remembered in regretful dirges. In the 1580s Sir Philip Sidney circulated copies of his influential heroic romance poem The \"Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia\" establishing Arcadia as an icon of the Renaissance; although the story is plentifully supplied with shepherds and other pastoral figures, the central characters of the plot are all royalty visiting the countryside. The Spanish playwright and poet Lope de Vega also published in 1598 his \"Arcadia: Prose and Verse\", which was a bestseller for its time.\n\nDoes not the pleasantness of this place carry in itself sufficient reward for any time lost in it, or for any such danger that might ensue? Do you not see how everything conspires together to make this place a heavenly dwelling? Do you not see the grass, how in color they excel the emeralds ...? Do not these stately trees seem to maintain their flourishing old age, with the only happiness of their seat being clothed with a continual spring, because no beauty here should ever fade? Doth not the air breathe health which the birds (both delightful both to the ear and eye) do daily solemnize with the sweet consent of their voices? Is not every echo here a perfect music? And these fresh and delightful brooks, how slowly they slide away, as, loath to leave the company of so many things united in perfection, and with how sweet a murmur they lament their forced departure. Certainly, certainly, cousin, it must needs be, that some goddess this desert belongs unto, who is the soul of this soil, for neither is any less than a goddess worthy to be shrined in such a heap of pleasures, nor any less than a goddess could have made it so perfect a model of the heavenly dwellings.\nThough depicted as contemporary, this pastoral form is often connected with the Golden Age. It may be suggested that its inhabitants have merely continued to live as people did in the Golden Age, and all other nations have less pleasant lives because they have allowed themselves to depart from the original simplicity.\n\nArcadia is now the name of many cities and towns around the world, including upwards of a dozen municipalities in the US. Arcadia University is a college located in Glenside, Pennsylvania. The plotlands of Wales and England have been referred to by media and local Government as Arcadia.\n\nThe 16th-century Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano applied the name \"Arcadia\" to the entire North American Atlantic coast north of Virginia. In time, this mutated to \"Acadia\". The \"Dictionary of Canadian Biography\" says: \"Arcadia, the name Verrazzano gave to Maryland or Virginia 'on account of the beauty of the trees', made its first cartographical appearance in the 1548 Gastaldo map and is the only name on that map to survive in Canadian usage. . . . In the 17th century Champlain fixed its present orthography, with the 'r' omitted, and Ganong has shown its gradual progress northwards, in a succession of maps, to its resting place in the Atlantic Provinces\".\n\nRevival of Mi'kmaw language has provided strong reason to believe that Verrazzano was informed by the name the Mi'kmaq gave to this place. The name Acadie may be derived from the Mi'kmaq, because in their language the word “cadie” means \"place of abundance” and can be found in names such as “Tracadie” and “Shubenacadie”.\n\nArcadia has been a popular setting for writers of the 19th and 20th centuries, including W. S. Gilbert (in \"Happy Arcadia\" and \"Iolanthe\"). One of the most popular Edwardian musical comedies is \"The Arcadians\". In 1945, Evelyn Waugh sub-titled the first part of his novel \"Brideshead Revisited\" \"Et in Arcadia ego\". In Gabriel García Márquez's novel \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\", the founder and patriarch of the Macondo community bears the name José Arcadio Buendía. Over the course of the novel, Arcadio becomes a multigenerational patronym that resonates with many of the other utopian tropes explored elsewhere in the text. In the novel \"Blood Meridian\" by Cormac McCarthy, the character of Judge Holden names his rifle \"Et in Arcadia ego\". In 1993, Tom Stoppard wrote \"Arcadia\" (originally to have been titled \"Et in Arcadia ego\"), a play involving themes of classical beauty and order in nature.\n\nArcadia were a spin-off musical group formed in 1985 by three members of the band Duran Duran. Rock band The Libertines have referenced Arcadia as the destination their imaginary ship \"Albion\" sails towards. Canadian music producer Deadmau5 has a song called Arcadia. The Kite String Tangle also have a song titled Arcadia.\nThe metal opera \"Angel of Babylon\" by Tobias Sammet's Avantasia ends with \"Journey to Arcadia\".\n\nIn fantasy literature, Arcadia has been used as a magical realm, respective to the fictional universe in which the story occurs. Arcadia Darell is the name of a character in \"Second Foundation\" by Isaac Asimov. In the anime series \"Captain Harlock\", the ship in which he travels is known as the \"Arcadia\". He calls it the place \"to fight and live for our freedom [and dreams]\". In the recent movie \"\", the characters seek to travel to Arcadia, Alaska, which is promised to be free of zombies. In \"\", it is revealed that Arcadia refers to the USS \"Arcadia\", a ship that collects survivors for experimentation. \"Arcadia\" (2016) is the title of a novel by Iain Pears.\n\nA number of role-playing games have also adopted the idea, either using it as a separate realm within the multiverse (à la the Arcadia of the Dungeons & Dragons universe), or even using it as the central focus of an entire game system (as in White Wolf's game). In , Arcadia is presented as a hellish realm, where humans abducted by the True Fae are subject to unimaginable torment and torture, in sharp contrast to its usual utopian description. \"Dragonhaven\", a young adult fantasy novel by Robin McKinley, ends with the phrase \"Arcadiae vias peregrinentur,\" which the author has stated roughly translates to \"May they walk in Arcadia\". According to the best-selling PC-game \"The Longest Journey\", Arcadia was divided from the primordial original world, and represents fantasy, dreams and magic, while our world, Stark, is the world of science and technology. In the game \"BioShock\", Arcadia is a level in which the protagonist has to navigate through an artificial forest. Arcadia was created by Dr. Julie Langford. This forest provides the oxygen for the rest of the underwater city of Rapture, and was used as a peaceful retreat for the citizens. Arcadia is the name of the world in the Sega Dreamcast game \"Skies of Arcadia\" in which the inhabitants live on floating islands and continents, and fly through the skies in airships. \"Neo Arcadia\" is the name given to the now center-of-the-world paradise city in the post-apocalyptic world of the \"Mega Man Zero\" series, as a place where humans and reploids live together side by side, though the Neo Arcadian government proves to be overbearing & ruthless in the fight against mavericks, going so far as to unjustly condemn innocent reploids to retirement(i.e. death). As such, they are the main antagonistic force throughout the majority of the \"Zero\" series.\nIn \"The Longest Journey\" and \"Dreamfall\" PC games, Arcadia is a realm of magic which the player is transported to.\n\nThe name has recently been connected with the pseudo-history of the Freemasons - in particular the Latin motto \"Et in Arcadia ego\" (\"Even here, I [Death] exist.\") The phrase is used frequently in conspiracy fiction and lore, such as the pseudo-historical work \"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\" and the novel \"The Da Vinci Code\", where it is interpreted as an anagram of \"I! Tego Arcana Dei\" (\"Begone! I know the secrets of God\").\n\nArcadia is also the name given to the second-city of the Time Lord's home-planet Gallifrey in the British sci-fi TV series Doctor Who. The Gods of Arcadia is a sci-mythology series by Andrea Stehle. It is a world in mankind's future controlled by the gods of ancient Greece.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22858602", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22858602", "title": "Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia", "text": "Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia\n\nLandscape with Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia is a painting of 1682 in oil on canvas by Claude Lorrain (Claude Gellée, traditionally just \"Claude\" in English), a painter from the Duchy of Lorraine who spent his career in Rome. It was painted in Rome for Prince Lorenzo Onofrio Colonna (1637–1689), Claude's most important patron in his last years, and is now in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. It is signed, dated with the year, and inscribed with the subject (at centre bottom), as Claude sometimes did with his less common subjects.\n\nIt was Claude's last painting, and is perhaps not quite finished; it therefore does not appear in the \"Liber Veritatis\", where he made drawings to record his finished works. His date of birth is uncertain, but he was at least in his late seventies when he painted it, perhaps as old as 82. It was a pendant to his painting, completed six years earlier, \"View of Carthage with Dido and Aeneas\" (or \"Aeneas's Farewell to Dido in Carthage\", 1676, now Kunsthalle, Hamburg), another scene from the \"Aeneid\", coming earlier than this one. This was the last of Claude's many harbour scenes. With the Oxford painting hung on the left, the groups of figures in each face inwards, and the main buildings frame the outsides of the pair. Both paintings feature large columns on a classical building, a punning reference to the Colonna family, who included such a column in their coat of arms.\n\nThe painting depicts a scene from , verses 483–499, of Virgil's epic poem the \"Aeneid\". Aeneas's son Ascanius shoots a stag that is the house-reared pet of Silvia, daughter of \"Tyrrheus, chief ranger to the Latian king\" (John Dryden's translation), provoking a war with Latium for the future site of Rome. Virgil's account, over 16 lines, spends most of them describing the closeness of the relationship between Sylvia and the stag. The moment shown is one of stillness, as Ascanius takes aim and the stag, too trusting in its special status, looks at him. Once the arrow is fired the tranquil coastal landscape spreading out behind them will very quickly be disrupted by the war that Virgil goes on to describe. \n\nUnusually for Claude, the sky is overcast with storm clouds, and the trees are bent by a wind blowing from the left. The elaborate temple in the Corinthian order has long been falling into ruin. On the face of it this, in a scene from before the founding of Rome, is an anachronism that would have been apparent even in the 17th century, but it reflects the state to which ancient Roman monuments were reduced in Claude's own time. The painting therefore embraces the whole trajectory of Roman civilization across history, from its start to its end, and peoples an idealized landscape from Claude's time with figures from its early history. \n\nThe subject is very rare in art, but there is a composition by Rubens, with a painting in Girona and an oil sketch in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, showing a different point in the story. This is also a late work, but the composition could hardly be more different; here Sylvia nurses the dying stag as a female companion keeps the hounds off it, and fighting has broken out behind them between the Latins and Ascanius' party. \n\nClaude may well have been aware of a depiction in the Vergilius Romanus, a 5th-century illustrated manuscript of the works of Virgil in the Vatican Library (Cod. Vat. lat. 3867, f 163 recto), which was a subject of interest to Roman cognoscenti. Stripped of the landscape the elements in the picture are similar, though Ascanius has already wounded the stag, and is pulling the bow for a second shot. A scene closer to the Rubens, with the wounded stag finding Silvia, is in the Vergilius Vaticanus of about 400; curiously, this is the point where the two Late antique Virgil cycles of illustration come closest to matching.\n\nThe composition evolved through a series of drawings, beginning in 1669, with two now at Chatsworth House (1671 or 1678) and the Ashmolean (1682). The final composition, with the river separating the archer and the stag, was only arrived at late in the process. As in the pendant in Hamburg, and many paintings by Claude, the composition draws the viewer's gaze into the background by having two large \"repoussoir\" elements at each side, where one is very close at hand, and the other set much further back. The diagonal from left to right thus set up is balanced by the river, which flows in the opposite direction.\n\nAlthough virtually every painting by Claude contains figures, even if only a shepherd, their weakness has always been recognised, not least by Claude himself; according to his biographer Filippo Baldinucci he joked that he charged for his landscapes, but gave the figures for free. According to his other contemporary biographer Joachim von Sandrart he had made considerable efforts to improve them, but without success; certainly there are numerous studies, typically for groups of figures, among his drawings. \n\nIn Claude's last years his figures tend to become ever more elongated, a process taken to an extreme in this painting, of which even its owner says \"The hunters are impossibly elongated – Ascanius, in particular, is absurdly top-heavy\". Its pendant has figures almost as extreme. With the mid-20th fashion for medical diagnosis through art, it was suggested that Claude had developed an optical condition producing such effects, but this has been rejected by doctors and critics alike.\n\nDespite the figures, the painting has been one of the most admired of Claude's works. For Anthony Blunt, it \"reveals all the qualities of the artist's last phase ... The range of colour is reduced to its utmost limits: silvery green trees, pale grey-blue sky, grey architecture, and neutral-coloured dresses for the figures. The trees are now so diaphanous and the portico is so open that they hardly interrupt the continuity of the air. The figures are thin and elongated, so that they, too, have the immaterial quality suited to this fairyland. All the elements of Claude's poetry are here in their most naked form, but combined in a magical way which defies analysis\". \n\nFor the Claude specialist Michael Kitson it \"at once sums up and goes beyond Claude's previous development. It is utterly personal and yet has that profound, tremulous and remote quality which characterizes the style of other great artists in their old age.\"\n\nOnce completed, the painting remained in the Colonna Palace in Rome until 1798/9, when the French occupied Rome, alarming the great families of the nobility. Along with many other top paintings from Roman collections, it was bought by the English collector, dealer, writer, and curator William Young Ottley. Ottley brought it to London, at a time when Claudes were fetching huge prices. It was sold at Christie's on 16 May 1801 for £462, being from now on separated from its pendant, which fetched £840. It was bought by the banker Sir Thomas Baring, Bt, and was at his house Stratton Park, Hampshire, by 1837. It remained in the Baring family collection until the 2nd Earl of Northbrook sold it at Christie's in 1919 for £588; by this time prices for Claudes had plunged, allowing for inflation. It was given to the Ashmolean in 1926 by Mrs F. Weldon.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1864778", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864778", "title": "Bengal School of Art", "text": "Bengal School of Art\n\nThe Bengal School of Art commonly referred as Bengal School, was an art movement and a style of Indian painting that originated in Bengal, primarily Kolkata and Shantiniketan, and flourished throughout India during the British Raj in the early 20th century. Also known as 'Indian style of painting' in its early days, it was associated with Indian nationalism (swadeshi) and led by Abanindranath Tagore (1871-1951), but was also promoted and supported by British arts administrators like E. B. Havell, the principal of the Government College of Art, Kolkata from 1896; eventually it led to the development of the modern Indian painting.\nThe Bengal school arose as an avant garde and nationalist movement reacting against the academic art styles previously promoted in India, both by Indian artists such as Raja Ravi Varma and in British art schools. Following the influence of Indian spiritual ideas in the West, the British art teacher Ernest Binfield Havell attempted to reform the teaching methods at the Calcutta School of Art by encouraging students to imitate Mughal miniatures. This caused controversy, leading to a strike by students and complaints from the local press, including from nationalists who considered it to be a retrogressive move. Havell was supported by the artist Abanindranath Tagore, a nephew of the poet Rabindranath Tagore. Tagore painted a number of works influenced by Mughal art, a style that he and Havell believed to be expressive of India's distinct spiritual qualities, as opposed to the \"materialism\" of the West. Tagore's best-known painting, \"Bharat Mata\" (Mother India), depicted a young woman, portrayed with four arms in the manner of Hindu deities, holding objects symbolic of India's national aspirations. Tagore later attempted to develop links with Japanese artists as part of an aspiration to construct a pan-Asianist model of art. Through the paintings of 'Bharat Mata', Abanindranath established the pattern of patriotism. Painters and artists of Bengal school were Nandalal Bose, M.A.R Chughtai, Sunayani Devi (sister of Abanindranath Tagore), Manishi Dey, Mukul Dey, Kalipada Ghoshal, Asit Kumar Haldar, Sudhir Khastgir, Kshitindranath Majumdar, Sughra Rababi, Debi Prasad Roychoudhury, Bireswar Sen, Beohar Rammanohar Sinha, Kiron Sinha,TP Gaganendranath Tagore (Tagore's brother) \nMeharThapar and Sarada Ukil.\n\nThe Bengal school's influence in India declined with the spread of modernist ideas in the 1920s. , there has been a surge in interest in the Bengal school of art among scholars and connoisseurs.\n\nHowever, Bengal continues to produce some of the best artists of modern India. There is a department in the Government College Of Art & Craft that has been training students the traditional style of tempera and wash painting for almost a century now. These students are carrying the legacy of the Bengal School artists, who, initially, were a group of artists, following Abanindranath's style and sharing his aesthetic vision. Among them, Dhirendranath Brahma is the living legend of the Bengal School of Art. He is a master of calligraphy and has innumerable students who are carrying on the tradition of Bengal School of painting. Among the other renowned artists of this style of painting are Ajoy Ghosh, Sankarlal Aich, Amal Chaklader, Narendranath De Sarkar, Sukti Subhra Pradhan & Ratan Acharya. \nSome of the best known artists of present-day Bengal are Jogen Chowdhury, Mrinal Kanti Das, Gopal Sanyal, Ganesh Pyne, Manishi Dey, Shanu Lahiri, Ganesh Haloi Jahar Dasgupta, Samir Aich, Bikash Bhattacharjee, Sudip Roy, Ramananda Bandopadhyay and Devajyoti Ray.\nSanat Chatterjee is one of the last living pioneers of Bengal School of art. He studied under Asit Kumar Haldar for around fifteen years.\n\nR. Siva Kumar, who has been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and their approach to art since the early 80s, refutes the practice of subsuming Nandalal Bose, Rabindranath Tagore, Ram Kinker Baij and Benode Behari Mukherjee under the Bengal School of Art. According to Siva Kumar, 'This happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice'.\n\nHis ideas on this issue are formulated in the catalogue essay of the exhibition .\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5842698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5842698", "title": "Choregos", "text": "Choregos\n\nIn the theatre of ancient Greece, the chorêgos (pl. \"chorêgoi\"; , Greek etymology: χορός \"chorus\" + ἡγεῖσθαι \"to lead\") was a wealthy Athenian citizen who assumed the public duty, or \"choregiai\", of financing the preparation for the chorus and other aspects of dramatic production that were not paid for by the government of the \"polis\" or city-state. Modern Anglicized forms of the word include choragus and choregus, with the accepted plurals being the Latin forms \"choregi\" and \"choragi\". In modern Greek the word \"χορηγός\" is synonymous with the word \"grantor\".\n\n\"Choregoi\" were appointed by the archon and the tribes of Athenian citizens from among the Athenian citizens of great wealth. Service as a \"choregos\", though an honor, was a duty for wealthy citizens and was part of the liturgical system designed to improve the city-state's economic stability through the use of private wealth to fund public good. Choregoi paid for costumes, rehearsals, expenses of the chorus (including training, salaries, board and lodging), scenery, props (including elaborate masks), special effects and most of the musicians. The \"choregos\" also hosted a feast if his chorus proved victorious in competition. The prizes for drama at the Athenian festival competitions were awarded jointly to the playwright and the \"choregos\". Such victories carried prestige for the \"choregos\". Several notable political figures served as \"choregoi\", including Themistocles, Pericles and Plato, among others. Monuments were built in honor of victorious \"choregoi\".\n\nAt the turn of the 17th century AD, in an attempt to recreate the ancient Greek dramatic tradition, the position was revived briefly in Italian opera, and combined the roles of impresario and director.\n\nUnder the Athenian constitution, \"choregoi\" were appointed by the archon and the tribes of Athenian citizens. The archon appointed \"choregoi\" for the tragedies, while the tribes supplied five \"choregoi\" for the comedies as well as \"choregoi\" for the Dionysia and Thargelia (the major festival competitions). The archon, who began this process months in advance of a festival, were able easily to identify potential dramatic \"choregoi\" because their mutual wealth allowed them to move in the same social circles as the most qualified candidates. In order to be considered for the role of \"choregos\", an individual had to be an Athenian citizen and possess great wealth. \"Choregoi\" for choruses of boys were required by Athenian law to be over forty years old to protect the young participants. Volunteers from this selected group of qualified individuals may have been the source of most appointments. The figure of the \"choregos\" can be traced back as early as the 7th century B.C. References to the title are found in recovered portions of the earliest choral lyric poetry, including the \"Parthenia\" (or \"Maiden-songs\") of Alkman, a poet of archaic Sparta.\n\nService as a \"choregos\", though an honor, was a duty rather than a choice for wealthy citizens. This duty was one among many built into the state liturgical system of ancient Athens, which was designed to improve the city-state's economic stability through the use of private wealth to fund public good. Once nominated, however, a potential \"choregos\" had three choices. He could accept the nomination and the duty. Through a process called \"skepsis\", he could claim one of several specifically defined exemptions and be excused from service. Finally, he could identify another Athenian who was more qualified to perform the role of \"choregos\" and use the procedure of \"skepsis\" to resolve the matter.\n\nChoregoi were responsible for supporting many aspects of theatre production in ancient Athens: paying for costumes, rehearsals, the chorus, scenery or scene painting (including such items as \"mechane\" and \"ekkyklema\"), props (including elaborate masks), special effects, such as sound, and musicians, except that the state provided the flute player and paid the actors not in the chorus. At the City Dionysia in Athens, for example, the \"choregos\" was expected to finance all aspects relating to the chorus, which could include training, the hiring of an expert to execute such training, salaries, and board and lodging during a lengthy rehearsal period.\n\nThe \"choregos\" did not act as the director for the production; this role was fulfilled by the playwright. The \"choregos\" would appoint a \"chorodidaskalos\" (Χοροδιδάσκαλος, often shortened to διδάσκαλος), often the playwright, to train the chorus. The \"choregos\" was often expected to host a feast, analogous to a modern cast party, should his chorus prove victorious in competition. According to the \"Oxford Dictionary of the Classical World\": \"The sums spent on choregiai show that the duty could elicit vast expenditure. One extremely enthusiastic choregos catalogues a list which represents an outlay of nearly two and a half talents. This includes a dithyrambic choregia at the Little Panathenaea for 300 drachmae, and a tragic choregia for 3,000 dr. The latter figure is roughly ten times what a skilled worker might have earned annually.\" The reorganization of the \"choregia\" in 406 BC spread the cost among the wider community – the synchoregia – with the \"choregos\" paying only part of the expense.\n\nThe prizes for drama at the Dionysia were awarded jointly to the playwright and the \"choregos\". Originally the \"choregos\" acted on behalf of his tribe, which collectively won the kudos for a successful performance. Gradually the sponsoring \"choregoi\" asserted more personal responsibility, and by the fourth century BC the prize for the \"choregos\" was a personal award. The winner was expected to display his trophy in a place of honor. Such victories carried prestige for the \"choregos\", and these honors could be an important stepping stone to a successful political career for wealthy young Athenians. Conversely, failure to successfully execute one's role as a \"choregos\" could lead to social humiliation.\n\nVictorious \"choregoi\" were honored further with the erection of a monument in honor of their accomplishment. These monuments, which have become an important source of scholarly knowledge about the \"choregoi\", were the final step in the victory celebration, which also involved a parade and a feast. Each monument featured an eloquent inscription that echoed the original victory announcement made at the Dionysia.\n\nGreek society was a symbiosis of art and politics, and several notable political figures of the time served as \"choregoi\". Themistocles was \"choregos\" for Phrynichus' \"Phoenissae\" (named for the Phoenician women who formed the chorus), and Pericles acted as \"choregos\" for \"The Persians\" by Aeschylus. In 365 BC, Plato, a rare exception to the qualification of wealth, served as \"choregos\" for a boys chorus supported by the patronage of Dionysius II of Syracuse. Choregos Lysicrates is remembered today because of the monument still standing in Athens erected in honor of the festival victory of his production in 335 BC. Ruins of a choragic monument to Nicias from the 5th-century BC were discovered in Athens in 1852.\n\n\"Choregoi\" were an example of a larger tradition of cosmopolitanism, defined by an interest in benefiting others, that dominated many aspects of urban life for the wealthy in ancient Greece and which has been linked to Western philanthropy. Many of these acts, which also included subsidy of temples, armories, and other essential municipal needs, were driven more by personal vanity, societal pressure, and political influence than the modern philanthropic impulse. Nevertheless, the \"choregoi's\" contributions to the theatre of ancient Greece were integral to the flourishing of drama in ancient Greece and the structure of the society's cultural landscape. One of the earliest references to the philanthropic impulse can be traced to Aeschylus's \"Prometheus Bound\" with the use of the word \"philanthropia\", which is translates to \"love of humankind,\" displaying an early tie between the theatre and the \"choregoi\", and philanthropy.\n\nAt the turn of the 17th century AD, when the first operas were being written in an attempt to recreate the old Greek dramatic tradition, the position of \"choregos\" was revived briefly. It was known in Italian as \"corago\", and combined the roles of impresario and director.\n\n\n\n"}

Christian Humanists viewed Erasmus as their leader in the early 16th century.

They began in the late 1490s as informal Latin exercises for Erasmus' own pupils. In about 1522 he began to perceive the possibilities this form might hold for continuing his campaign for the gradual enlightenment and reform of all Christendom. Between that date and 1533 twelve new editions appeared, each larger and more serious than the last, until eventually some fifty individual colloquies were included ranging over such varied subjects as war, travel, religion, sleep, beggars, funerals, and literature. All of these works were in the same graceful, easy style and gentle humor that made them continually sought as schoolboy exercises and light reading for generations.\n\n"}

Cresta, which stands for \"Creative Standards\", has grown to cover twelve distinct groups of competition: Press, Outdoor, Ambient Media, TV/Cinema/Online Film, Interactive, Radio, Direct Marketing, Design, Incentives & Promotions, Branded Entertainment, Crafts and Integrated Campaigns.\n\nCresta's U.S. headquarters is located in New York City.\n\nCresta is an extensive and highly selective awards program, an official 2017 press release noting a reception of more than 3,300 entries from 53 countries for the 2016 competition, with 74 entries from 13 countries designated as winners. Entries are screened by several international \"pre-selection\" juries responsible for compiling a shortlist to be given to a Grand Jury of seasoned creative directors, graphic artists, and film specialists from around the world. The Cresta Grand Jury, unlike the pre-selection juries, is a permanent jury consisting of 86 members from 45 countries. Members judge the shortlisted entries on their own time and individually, the no-discussion policy placing stress on creativity solely. This body decides on the Gold, Silver, and Bronze winners, as well as if an entry has met the pre-determined standard of earning a Grand Prix award, based on two elements: originality of the idea and the quality of the idea's execution. \n\nIn 2010, Cresta introduced the Network of the Year and Agency of the Year honors, given out to those whose entries meet the highest scores, based on a point breakdown, in all levels of competition.\n\nFor its first 12 years in existence, Cresta held its awards ceremony in a number of cities throughout the world, including Budapest, Milan, and New York. It was determined after the 2004 awards that future winners would be announced via an online ceremony, allowing exponentially more participants the chance to view the winners. The annual winners are currently released in a virtual showcase designed for all electronic devices, including mobile phones and tablets. \n\nThe Cresta statuette is a crystal \"S\" shape with an embedded metal \"C\" component, together meant to embody the \"Creative Standards\" namesake.

Michelle Monaghan, Juliette Lewis and Jamie Foxx also star.\n\nShot in Las Cruces, New Mexico, Atlanta, Georgia, and Tuscaloosa, Alabama, the film was released on November 5, 2010. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $211 million worldwide.\n\nPeter Highman (Robert Downey Jr.), a successful architect, is due to fly home from Atlanta to Los Angeles to be with his wife Sarah (Michelle Monaghan), who is about to give birth. On the way to the airport, he has a chance encounter with Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis), who is going to LA to be an actor and is planning to scatter his recently deceased father's ashes at the Grand Canyon. When Ethan misuses the words \"terrorist\" and \"bomb\" while talking to Peter, they are both escorted off the plane. This is only the first of a series of misadventures caused by the drastically dysfunctional Ethan. Peter, now on the No Fly List and missing his wallet, agrees to drive with Ethan to Los Angeles.\n\nEthan stops to buy marijuana, and Peter discovers that they are nearly out of money. Since Peter has no I.D., he gets his wife to wire the money to Ethan, but discovers Ethan had the money wired to his stage name instead of his legal name. When the Western Union employee (Danny McBride) refuses to accept Ethan's \"Stage name I.D.\" it leads to a violent altercation.\n\nAfter a night at a rest stop, Peter decides to drive off and abandon Ethan, but realizes that he still has Ethan's father's ashes, having forgotten to unload them with the rest of Ethan's stuff when he left. This causes him to wrestle with his conscience, and he decides to return. Ethan drives so Peter can get some rest, but he falls asleep at the wheel and crashes the car. After Peter and Ethan are picked up by Peter's friend Darryl (Jamie Foxx), Peter again decides to part company with Ethan. Darryl initially persuades him otherwise, but then throws Ethan out after mistakenly drinking some of Ethan's father's ashes, which were stored in a coffee tin.\n\nWhen Darryl lets them use his Range Rover to make the rest of the trip, Ethan mistakenly drives to the Mexico–United States border. Despite assuring Peter that he'll handle the situation, Ethan flees, and Peter is arrested for possession of marijuana.

Peter then confesses that he tried to leave Ethan at the rest area. Ethan makes a confession of his own: he has had Peter's wallet and I.D the entire time. Peter seemingly forgives him but then attacks Ethan in a rage, but is interrupted by a call from Sarah, who has just gone into labor. Peter and Ethan leave for California. Ethan finds a gun in the truck and he accidentally shoots Peter. Arriving at the hospital where Sarah is in labor, Peter passes out from loss of blood.\n\nSarah delivers the baby safely, and Peter expresses his discomfort at his new daughter being named Rosie Highman.

In this respect they differ slightly from the medical definition, which defines entoptic phenomena as only applying to sources within the eye, not the brain. To avoid this confusion, the term subjective visual phenomena is sometimes used. \"Entoptic\" was chosen by author David Lewis Williams due to its origin from Greek meaning \"coming from within\".\n\nThere has been a great deal of work trying to find evidence of motifs and compositions derived from entoptic phenomena in prehistoric art, especially rock art and megalithic art. The justification of this research is that entoptic phenomena normally occur during states of altered consciousness, the practice of which may impact our views of ancient religious and social practice. The importance of looking outside traditional methods of research for interpreting prehistoric cultures is made more so due to the lack of abundant data which makes current cultural studies viable. \"Art and the ability to comprehend it are more dependent on kinds of mental imagery and the ability to manipulate mental images than on intelligence.\"\n\nExperiences include geometric visual patterns such as dots, zagging lines, as well as grid patterns which are all common shapes which are universally understood by the human condition. These patterns and shapes can be seen without aid of psychotropic substances but under their influence the heightened effects precipitate modes of altered consciousness. Entoptic experiences differ from hallucinations in that they are a purely visual phenomenon, while hallucinations represent experience of culturally occurring themes as well as physical coming from the five senses.\n\nEntoptic Phenomena are interpreted in ways that can be understood, matched to objects or ideas that may be familiar in day-to-day life and may also be attributed to the individuals state such as hunger, sexual arousal, or anxiety and fear. Placing objects in reality from base shapes seen under influence from pscychotropics which link to somatic physical responses lead now to full hallucinations. The relation between the first stage entoptic image and later stage full hallucinations are not mutually exclusive, both may be present.\n\nStage 3 images become iconic, relating to themes from the subjects life and become linked to powerful emotional experiences. Metaphor and simile give way to the belief that objects are exactly what they appear to be \"subject losing insight into the differences between literal and analogical meanings\" These stages may not always be sequential, and all stages may not be experienced depending on the subject and of course the type of psychotropic being used.\n\nWilliams notes that altered states are and their resulting impact on human consciousness is often marginalized within state, scientific, and religious realms. \"The contemporary Western emphasis on the supreme value of intelligence has tended to suppress certain forms of consciousness and to regard them as irrational, marginal,aberrant or even pathological and thereby to eliminate them from investigations of the deep past.\" As with any well rounded approach to cultural or historical study, all aspects of the human condition must be explored, especially when such exploration takes us outside of our usual cultural perspective.\n\n\n"}

Its members produce some 200 periodical titles with a combined circulation of over 15 million. EPA is a religious and educational non-profit corporation under the laws of the state of California. It is managed by an executive director, who is responsible to a board of six directors. \n\nIn the fall of 1947, a handful of editors met at the convention of the National Sunday School Association and began to talk about an association of evangelical editors. Dr. James DeForest Murch, editor of United Evangelical Action, took the lead and called together a pro tem committee in Chicago on May 6, 1948. Thirty-five editors met at the Congress Hotel in Chicago. They officially organized the Evangelical Press Association, adopted the doctrinal statement of the National Association of Evangelicals and wrote the statement of purpose printed above. On April 4–6, 1949, the first annual convention of the EPA met in Chicago with 103 publications represented.\n\nIn September, 1951, the association mailed the first copies of a news service to its members. It was produced by volunteers who sent out ten releases in the first five months. In 1952 it became a weekly service with a subscription rate of $10 a year. That year also the association began its newsletter, Liaison. In 1954 the association adopted a code of ethics and began an awards program.\n\nEPA has held an annual convention each year since 1949. The conventions were held in Chicago until 1957, then moved to a different city each year after that. The conventions were held in January until 1963 when the date was changed to April or May.\n\nAs the association grew, it demanded an executive secretary to carry on the administrative work and edit the news service.

{"id": "21336437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21336437", "title": "Haute couture", "text": "Haute couture\n\nHaute couture (; ; French for \"high sewing\" or \"high dressmaking\" or \"high fashion\") is the creation of exclusive custom-fitted clothing. \"Haute couture\" is high-end fashion that is constructed by hand from start to finish, made from high-quality, expensive, often unusual fabric and sewn with extreme attention to detail and finished by the most experienced and capable sewers - often using time-consuming, hand-executed techniques. \"Couture\" translates literally from French as \"dressmaking\" but may also refer to fashion, sewing, or needlework and is also used as a common abbreviation of \"haute couture\" and refers to the same thing in spirit. \"Haute\" translates literally to \"high\". A haute couture garment is always made for an individual client, tailored specifically for the wearer's measurements and body stance. Considering the amount of time, money, and skill allotted to each completed piece, haute couture garments are also described as having no price tag: budget is not relevant.\n\nThe term originally referred to Englishman Charles Frederick Worth's work, produced in Paris in the mid-nineteenth century. \"The Dapifer\" notes that Worth would allow his clients to select colors, fabrics and other details before ever beginning his design process which was unheard of at the time. In modern France, haute couture is a protected name that may not be used except by firms that meet certain well-defined standards. However, the term is also used loosely to describe all high-fashion custom-fitted clothing whether it is produced in Paris or in other fashion capitals such as London, Milan, New York City or Tokyo. In either case, the term can refer to the fashion houses or fashion designers that create exclusive and often trend-setting fashions or to the fashions created.\n\nIn France, the term \"haute couture\" is protected by law and is defined by the \"Chambre de commerce et d'industrie de Paris\" based in Paris. The \"chambre syndicale de la haute couture\" is defined as \"the regulating commission that determines which fashion houses are eligible to be true haute couture houses\". Their rules state that only \"those companies mentioned on the list drawn up each year by a commission domiciled at the Ministry for Industry are entitled to avail themselves\" of the label \"haute couture\". The Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne is an association of Parisian couturiers founded in 1868 as an outgrowth of medieval guilds that regulate its members in regard to counterfeiting of styles, dates of openings for collections, number of models presented, relations with press, questions of law and taxes, and promotional activities. Formation of the organization was brought about by Charles Frederick Worth. An affiliated school was organized in 1930 called L'Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture. The school helps bring new designers to help the \"couture\" houses that are still present today. Since 1975, this organization has worked within the Federation Francaise, de couture, du Prêt-à-Porter des Couturiers et des Createurs de Mode.\n\nMore rigorous criteria for \"haute couture\" were established in 1945. To earn the right to call itself a couture house and to use the term \"haute couture\" in its advertising and any other way, members of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture must follow specific rules:\n\nThe term \"haute couture\" has taken on further popular meanings referring to non-dressmaking activities, such as production of fine art, music, etc.\n\nHaute couture can be referenced back as early as the 17th Century. Rose Bertin, the French fashion designer to Queen Marie Antoinette, can be credited for bringing fashion and haute couture to French culture. Visitors to Paris brought back clothing that was then copied by local dressmakers. Stylish women also ordered dresses in the latest Parisian fashion to serve as models.\n\nAs railroads and steamships made European travel easier, it was increasingly common for wealthy women to travel to Paris to shop for clothing and accessories. French fitters and dressmakers were commonly thought to be the best in Europe, and real Parisian garments were considered better than local imitations.\n\nA () is an establishment or person involved in the clothing fashion industry who makes original garments to order for private clients. A couturier may make what is known as haute couture. Such a person usually hires patternmakers and machinists for garment production, and is either employed by exclusive boutiques or is self-employed.\n\nThe \"couturier\" Charles Frederick Worth (October 13, 1825 – March 10, 1895), is widely considered the father of \"haute couture\" as it is known today. Although born in Bourne, Lincolnshire, England, Worth made his mark in the French fashion industry. Revolutionizing how dressmaking had been previously perceived, Worth made it so the dressmaker became the artist of garnishment: a fashion designer. While he created one-of-a-kind designs to please some of his titled or wealthy customers, he is best known for preparing a portfolio of designs that were shown on live models at the House of Worth. Clients selected one model, specified colors and fabrics, and had a duplicate garment tailor-made in Worth's workshop. Worth combined individual tailoring with a standardization more characteristic of the ready-to-wear clothing industry, which was also developing during this period.\n\nFollowing in Worth's footsteps were Callot Soeurs, Patou, Poiret, Vionnet, Fortuny, Lanvin, Chanel, Mainbocher, Schiaparelli, Balenciaga, and Dior. Some of these fashion houses still exist today, under the leadership of modern designers.\n\nIn the 1960s, a group of young designers who had trained under men like Dior and Balenciaga left these established \"couture\" houses and opened their own establishments. The most successful of these young designers were Yves Saint Laurent, Pierre Cardin, André Courrèges, Ted Lapidus, and Emanuel Ungaro. Japanese native and Paris-based Hanae Mori was also successful in establishing her own line.\n\nLacroix is one of the fashion houses to have been started in the late 20th century. Other new houses have included Jean-Paul Gaultier and Thierry Mugler. Due to the high expenses of producing haute couture collections, Lacroix and Mugler have since ceased their haute couture activities.\n\nModernized haute couture shows are not designed and made to be sold, rather they are exactly what they are displayed for – for show. Instead of being constructed for the purpose of selling and making money, they are made to further the publicity, as well as perception and understanding of brand image.\n\nFor all these fashion houses, custom clothing is no longer the main source of income, often costing much more than it earns through direct sales; it only adds the aura of fashion to their ventures in ready-to-wear clothing and related luxury products such as shoes and perfumes, and licensing ventures that earn greater returns for the company. Excessive commercialization and profit-making can be damaging, however. Cardin, for example, licensed with abandon in the 1980s and his name lost most of its fashionable cachet when anyone could buy Cardin luggage at a discount store. It is their ready-to-wear collections that are available to a wider audience, adding a splash of glamour and the feel of haute couture to more wardrobes. Fashion houses still create custom clothing for publicity, for example providing items to the television show \"Gossip Girl\".\n\nThe 1960s also featured a revolt against established fashion standards by mods, rockers, and hippies, as well as an increasing internationalization of the fashion scene. Jet travel had spawned a jet set that partied—and shopped—just as happily in New York as in Paris. Rich women no longer felt that a Paris dress was necessarily better than one sewn elsewhere. While Paris is still pre-eminent in the fashion world, it is no longer the sole arbiter of fashion.\n\nFor the Spring 2017 season the official list of members are:\n\nRecent guest members have included the fashion houses of Boudicca, Cathy Pill, Richard René and Udo Edling, as well as Eymeric François, , and Ma Ke (Wuyong). In the 2008/2009 Fall/Winter Haute Couture week, Emanuel Ungaro showed as an Official Member.\n\nThe largest private collection of haute couture may be that of Mouna Ayoub, whose collection is estimated to encompass more than 1,600 items.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "179334", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=179334", "title": "Isaac Babel", "text": "Isaac Babel\n\nIsaac Emmanuilovich Babel (; — 27 January 1940) was a Russian writer, journalist, playwright, literary translator, historian and Bolshevik revolutionary. He is best known as the author of \"Red Cavalry\", \"Story of My Dovecote\" and \"The Odessa Tales\" — stories from the life of Jewish gangsters from Odessa led by Benya Krik (prototype — Mishka Yaponchik). He has been acclaimed as \"the greatest prose writer of Russian Jewry\".\n\nBabel fell victim to the Great Purge. He was arrested by the NKVD on the night of 15 May 1939. After confessing under interrogation to being a trotskyist terrorist and a foreign spy, he was shot on 27 January 1940.\n\nIsaac Babel was born in the Moldavanka section of Odessa to Manus and Feyga Bobel. Soon after his birth, the Babel family moved to the port city of Mykolaiv. They later returned to live in a more fashionable part of Odessa in 1906. Babel used Moldavanka as the setting for \"The Odessa Tales\" and the play \"Sunset\".\n\nAlthough Babel's short stories present his family as \"destitute and muddle-headed\", they were relatively well-off. According to his autobiographical statements, Babel's father, Manus, was an impoverished shopkeeper. Babel's daughter, Nathalie Babel Brown, stated that her father fabricated this and other biographical details in order to \"present an appropriate past for a young Soviet writer who was not a member of the Communist Party.\" In fact, Babel's father was a dealer in farm implements and owned a large warehouse.\n\nIn his teens, Babel hoped to get into the preparatory class of the Nicolas I Odessa Commercial School. However, he first had to overcome the Jewish quota. Despite the fact that Babel received passing grades, his place was given to another boy, whose parents had bribed school officials. As a result, he was schooled at home by private tutors.\n\nIn addition to regular school subjects, Babel studied the Talmud and music. According to Cynthia Ozick, \"Though he was at home in Yiddish and Hebrew, and was familiar with the traditional texts and their demanding commentaries, he added to these a lifelong fascination with Maupassant and Flaubert. His first stories were composed in fluent literary French. The breadth and scope of his social compass enabled him to see through the eyes of peasants, soldiers, priests, rabbis, children, artists, actors, women of all classes. He befriended whores, cabdrivers, jockeys; he knew what it was like to be penniless, to live on the edge and off the beaten track.\"\n\nAfter the Jewish quota also foiled an attempt to enroll at Odessa University, Babel entered the Kiev Institute of Finance and Business. There he met Yevgenia Borisovna Gronfein, daughter of a wealthy industrialist. She eventually eloped with him to Odessa.\n\nIn 1915, Babel graduated and moved to Petrograd, in defiance of laws restricting Jews to living within the Pale of Settlement. Babel was fluent in French, besides Russian, Ukrainian and Yiddish, and his earliest works were written in French. However, none of his stories in that language have survived.\n\nIn St. Petersburg, Babel met Maxim Gorky, who published some of Babel's stories in his literary magazine \"Letopis\" (\"Летопись\", \"Chronicle\"). Gorky advised the aspiring writer to gain more life experience; Babel wrote in his autobiography, \"... I owe everything to that meeting and still pronounce the name of Alexey Maksimovich Gorky with love and admiration.\" One of his most famous semi-autobiographical short stories, \"The Story of My Dovecote\" (\"История моей голубятни\", \"Istoriya moey golubyatni\"), was dedicated to Gorky.\n\nThe story \"The Bathroom Window\" was considered obscene by censors, and Babel was charged with violating criminal code article 1001.\n\nThere is very little information about Babel's whereabouts during and after the October Revolution. According to one of his stories, \"The Road\" (\"\"Дорога\", \"Doroga\"), he served on the Romanian front until early December 1917. He resurfaced in Petrograd in March 1918 as a reporter for Gorky's Menshevik newspaper, \"Novaya zhizn\" (\"Новая жизнь\", \"New Life\"\"). Babel continued publishing there until \"Novaya zhizn\" was forcibly closed on Lenin's orders in July 1918.\n\nBabel later recalled, \"My journalistic work gave me a lot, especially in the sense of material. I managed to amass an incredible number of facts, which proved to be an invaluable creative tool. I struck up friendships with morgue attendants, criminal investigators, and government clerks. Later, when I began writing fiction, I found myself always returning to these 'subjects', which were so close to me, in order to put character types, situations, and everyday life into perspective. Journalistic work is full of adventure.\"\n\nDuring the Russian Civil War, which led to the Party's monopoly on the printed word, Babel worked for the publishing house of the Odessa Gubkom (regional CPSU Committee), in the food procurement unit (see his story \"Ivan-and-Maria\"), in the \"Narkompros\" (Commissariat of Education), and in a typographic printing office.\n\nAfter the end of the Civil War, Babel worked as a reporter for \"The Dawn of the Orient\" (Заря Востока) a Russian-language newspaper published in Tbilisi. In one of his articles, he expressed regret that Lenin's controversial New Economic Policy had not been more widely implemented.\n\nBabel married Yevgenia Gronfein on August 9, 1919, in Odessa. In 1929, their marriage produced a daughter, Nathalie Babel Brown, who grew up to become a scholar and editor of her father's life and work. By 1925, the Babels' marriage was souring. Yevgenia Babel, feeling betrayed by her husband's infidelities and motivated by her increasing hatred of communism, emigrated to France. Babel saw her several times during his visits to Paris. During this period, he also entered into a long-term romantic relationship with Tamara Kashirina. Together, they had a son, Emmanuil Babel, who was later adopted by his stepfather Vsevolod Ivanov. Emmanuil's name was changed to Mikhail Ivanov, and he later became a noted artist.\n\nAfter the final break with Tamara, Babel briefly attempted to reconcile with Yevgenia and they had their daughter Natalie in 1929. In 1932, Babel met a Siberian-born Gentile named Antonina Pirozhkova (1909–2010). In 1934, after Babel failed to convince his wife to return to Moscow, he and Antonina began living together. In 1939, their common law marriage produced a daughter, Lydia Babel.\n\nAccording to Pirozhkova, \"Before I met Babel, I used to read a great deal, though without any particular direction. I read whatever I could get my hands on. Babel noticed this and told me, 'Reading that way will get you nowhere. You won't have time to read the books that are truly worthwhile. There are about a hundred books that every educated person needs to read. Sometime I'll try to make you a list of them.' And a few days later he brought me a list. There were ancient writers on it, Greek and Roman — Homer, Herodotus, Lucretius, Suetonius — and also all the classics of later European literature, starting with Erasmus, Rabelais, Cervantes, Swift, and Coster, and going on to 19th century writers such as Stendhal, Mérimée, and Flaubert.\"\n\nIn 1920, Babel was assigned to Komandarm (Army Commander) Semyon Budyonny's 1st Cavalry Army, witnessing a military campaign of the Polish-Soviet War of 1920. Poland was not alone in its newfound opportunities and troubles. Virtually all of the newly independent neighbours began fighting over borders: Romania fought with Hungary over Transylvania, Yugoslavia with Italy over Rijeka, and Poland with Czechoslovakia over Cieszyn Silesia, with Germany over Poznań, and with Ukrainians over Eastern Galicia (Galician War). He documented the horrors of the war he witnessed in the \"1920 Diary\" (\"Конармейский Дневник 1920 года\", \"Konarmeyskiy Dnevnik 1920 Goda\"), which he later used to write \"Red Cavalry\" (\"Конармия\", \"Konarmiya\"), a collection of short stories such as \"Crossing the River Zbrucz\" and \"My First Goose\". The horrific violence of \"Red Cavalry\" seemed to harshly contrast the gentle nature of Babel himself.\n\nBabel wrote: \"Only by 1923 I have learned how to express my thoughts in a clear and not very lengthy way. Then I returned to writing.\" Several stories that were later included in \"Red Cavalry\" were published in Vladimir Mayakovsky's \"LEF\" (\"ЛЕФ\") magazine in 1924. Babel's honest description of the brutal realities of war, far from revolutionary propaganda, earned him some powerful enemies. According to recent research, Marshal Budyonny was infuriated by Babel's unvarnished descriptions of marauding Red Cossacks and demanded Babel's execution without success. However, Gorky's influence not only protected Babel but also helped to guarantee publication. In 1929 \"Red Cavalry\" was translated into English by J. Harland and later was translated into a number of other languages.\n\nArgentine author and essayist Jorge Luis Borges once wrote of \"Red Cavalry\", The music of its style contrasts with the almost ineffable brutality of certain scenes. One of the stories, -- \"Salt\" -- enjoys a glory seemingly reserved for poems and rarely attained by prose: many people know it by heart.\n\nBack in Odessa, Babel started to write the \"Odessa Tales\", a series of short stories set in the Odessan ghetto of Moldavanka. At their core, the stories describe the life of Jewish gangsters, both before and after the October Revolution. Many of them directly feature the fictional mob boss Benya Krik, who remains one of the great anti-heroes of Russian literature. These stories were later used as the basis for the stage play \"Sunset\", which centers on Benya Krik's self-appointed mission to right the wrongs of Moldavanka. First on his list is to rein in his alcoholic, womanizing father, Mendel.\n\nAccording to Nathalie Babel Brown, \"\"Sunset\" premiered at the Baku Worker's Theatre on October 23, 1927 and played in Odessa, Kiev, and the celebrated Moscow Art Theatre. The reviews, however, were mixed. Some critics praised the play's 'powerful anti-bourgeois stance and its interesting 'fathers and sons' theme. But in Moscow, particularly, critics felt that the play's attitude toward the bourgeoisie was contradictory and weak. \"Sunset\" closed, and was dropped from the repertoire of the Moscow Art Theatre.\n\nHowever, \"Sunset\" continued to have admirers. In a 1928 letter to his White emigre father, Boris Pasternak wrote, \"Yesterday, I read \"Sunset\", a play by Babel, and almost for the first time in my life I found that Jewry, as an ethnic fact, was a phenomenon of positive, unproblematic importance and power... I should like you to read this remarkable play...\"\n\nAccording to Pirozhkova, filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein was also an admirer of \"Sunset\" and often compared it to the writings of Émile Zola for, \"illuminating capitalist relationships through the experience of a single family.\" Eisenstein was also quite critical of the Moscow Art Theatre, \"for its weak staging of the play, particularly for failing to convey to the audience every single word of its unusually terse text.\"\n\nAccording to Nathalie Babel Brown, \"The young writer burst upon the literary scene and instantly became the rage in Moscow. The tradition in Russia being to worship poets and writers, Babel soon became one of the happy few, a group that included Soviet writers who enjoyed exceptional status and privileges in an otherwise impoverished and despotic country. In the late 1930s, he was given a villa in the writer's colony of Peredelkino, outside Moscow. No secret was ever made of his having a wife and daughter in Paris. At the same time, hardly anyone outside of Moscow knew of two other children he had fathered. As a matter of fact, Babel had many secrets, lived with many ambiguities and contradictions, and left many unanswered questions behind him.\"\n\nIn 1930, Babel travelled in Ukraine and witnessed the brutality of forced collectivisation and dekulakisation. Although he never made a public statement about this, he privately confided in Antonina, \"The bounty of the past is gone -- it is due to the famine in Ukraine and the destruction of the village across our land.\"\n\nAs Stalin tightened his grip on the Soviet intelligentsia and decreed that all writers and artists must conform to socialist realism, Babel increasingly withdrew from public life. During the campaign against \"Formalism\", Babel was publicly denounced for low productivity. At the time, many other Soviet writers were terrified and frantically rewrote their past work to conform to Stalin's wishes. However, Babel was unimpressed and confided in his protégé, the writer Ilya Ehrenburg, \"In six months time, they'll leave the formalists in peace and start some other campaign.\"\n\nAt the first congress of the Union of Soviet Writers (1934), Babel noted ironically, that he was becoming \"the master of a new literary genre, the genre of silence.\" American Max Eastman describes Babel's increasing reticence as an artist in a chapter called \"The Silence of Isaac Babyel\" in his 1934 book \"Artists in Uniform\".\n\nBabel's play \"Maria\" candidly depicts both political corruption, prosecution of the innocent, and black marketeering within Soviet society. Noting the play's implicit rejection of socialist realism, Maxim Gorky accused his friend of having a \"Baudelairean predilection for rotting meat.\" Gorky further warned his friend that \"political inferences\" would be made \"that will be personally harmful to you.\" According to Pirozhkova, \"Once Babel went to the Moscow Art Theater when his play \"Mariya\" was being given its first reading, and when he returned home he told me that all the actresses had been impatient to find out what the leading female role was like and who would be cast in it. It turned out that there was no leading female character present on the stage in this play. Babel thought that the play had not come off well, but it should be noted that he was always critical of his own work.\" Although intended to be performed in 1935, the \"Maria\"'s performance was cancelled by the NKVD during rehearsals. Despite its popularity in the West, \"Maria\" was not performed in Russia until after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n\nCarl Weber, a former disciple of Bertolt Brecht, directed \"Maria\" at Stanford University in 2004.\nAccording to Weber, \"The play is very controversial. [It] shows the stories of both sides clashing with each other during the Russian Civil War — the Bolsheviks and the old society members — without making a judgment one way or another. Babel’s opinion on either side is very ambiguous, but he does make the statement that what happened after the Bolshevik Revolution may not have been the best thing for Russia.\"\n\nIn 1932, after numerous requests, he was permitted to visit his estranged wife Yevgenia in Paris. While visiting his wife and their daughter Nathalie, Babel agonized over whether or not to return to Soviet Russia. In conversations and letters to friends, he expressed a longing of being \"a free man,\" while also expressing fear at no longer being able to make a living solely through writing. On July 27, 1933, Babel wrote a letter to Yuri Annenkov, stating that he had been summoned to Moscow and was leaving immediately.\n\nBabel's common-law wife, Antonina Pirozhkova, recalled this era, \"Babel remained in France for so long that it was rumored in Moscow that he was never returning. When I wrote to him about this, he wrote back saying, 'What can people, who do not know anything, possibly say to you, who knows everything?' Babel wrote from France almost daily. I accumulated many letters from him during his 11-month absence. When Babel was arrested in 1939, all of these letters were confiscated and never returned to me.\"\n\nAfter his return to Russia, Babel decided to move in with Pirozhkova, beginning a common law marriage which would ultimately produce a daughter, Lidya Babel. He also collaborated with Sergei Eisenstein on the film \"Bezhin Meadow\", about Pavlik Morozov, a child informant for the Soviet secret police. Babel also worked on the screenplays for several other Stalinist propaganda films.\n\nAccording to Nathalie Babel Brown, \"Babel came to Paris in the summer of 1935, as part of the delegation of Soviet writers to the International Congress of Writers for the Defense of Culture and Peace. He probably knew this would have been his last chance to remain in Europe. As he had done numerous times during the last ten years, he asked my mother to return with him to Moscow. Although he knew the general situation was bad, he nevertheless described to her the comfortable life that the family could have there together. It was the last opportunity my mother had to give a negative answer, and she never forgot it. Perhaps it helped her later on to be proven completely right in her fears and her total lack of confidence in the Soviet Union. My mother described to me these last conversations with my father many times.\"\n\nDuring a visit to Berlin, the married Babel began an affair with Yevgenia Feigenberg, who was then a translator at the Soviet embassy. Simon Sebag Montefiore has dubbed Yevgenia an \"irrepressible literary groupie.\" According to Babel's interrogation transcripts, she began her seduction of the writer with the words, \"You don't know me, but I know you well.\" Even after Yevgenia married NKVD boss N. I. Yezhov the affair continued and Babel frequently presided over Mrs. Yezhov's literary gatherings, which often included such luminaries as Solomon Mikhoels, Leonid Utesov, Sergei Eisenstein, and Mikhail Koltsov. On one such occasion, Babel was heard to say, \"Just think, our girl from Odessa has become the first lady of the kingdom!\"\n\nIn her memoirs, Antonina professes complete ignorance of her common law husband's affair with Mrs. Yezhov. Babel informed her that his interest in the Yezhovs was, \"purely professional,\" and was tied to his desire to understand the Party elite.\n\nIn retaliation for Babel's affair with his wife, Yezhov ordered the writer placed under constant NKVD surveillance. As the Great Purge began during the late 1930s, Yezhov was informed that Babel was spreading rumors about the suspicious death of Maxim Gorky and alleging that his former mentor had been murdered on orders from Stalin. Babel had also been heard to say of Leon Trotsky, \"It's impossible to imagine the charm and strength of his influence on anyone who encounters him.\" Babel further commented that Lev Kamenev was, \"...the most brilliant connoisseur of language and literature.\"\n\nAs the number of Purge victims skyrocketed, however, Nikolai Yezhov's overenthusiastic pursuit of suspected \"enemies\" began to be thought a liability by Stalin and his inner circle. In response, Lavrenti Beria was assigned as Yezhov's assistant and swiftly usurped the leadership of the NKVD.\n\nAccording to Montefiore, \"The darkness began to descend upon Yezhov's family where his silly, sensual wife was unwittingly to play the terrible role of black widow spider: most of her lovers were to die. She herself was too sensitive a flower for Yezhov's world. Both she and Yezhov were promiscuous but by then they lived in a world of high tension, dizzy power over life and death, and dynamic turmoil as men rose and fell around them. If there was justice in Yezhov's fall, it was a tragedy for Yevgenia and little Natasha, to whom he was a kind father. A pall fell on Yevgenia's literary salon. When a friend walked her home to the Kremlin after a party, she herself reflected that Babel was in danger because he had been friends with arrested Trotskyite generals: 'Only his European fame could save him.' She herself was in greater danger.\"\n\nOn May 15, 1939, Antonina Pirozhkova was awakened by four NKVD agents pounding upon the door of their Moscow apartment. Although surprised, she agreed to accompany them to Babel's dacha in Peredelkino. Babel was then placed under arrest. According to Pirozhkova: \"In the car, one of the men sat in back with Babel and me while the other one sat in front with the driver. 'The worst part of this is that my mother won't be getting my letters', and then he was silent for a long time. I could not say a single word. Babel asked the secret policeman sitting next to him, 'So I guess you don't get too much sleep, do you?' And he even laughed. As we approached Moscow, I said to Babel, 'I'll be waiting for you, it will be as if you've gone to Odessa... only there won't be any letters...' He answered, 'I ask you to see that the child not be made miserable.' \"But I don't know what my destiny will be.\" At this point, the man sitting beside Babel said to me, \"We have no claims whatsoever against you.\" We drove to the Lubyanka Prison and through the gates. The car stopped before the massive, closed door where two sentries stood guard. Babel kissed me hard and said, \"Someday we'll see each other...\" And without looking back, he got out of the car and went through that door.\n\nAccording to Nadezhda Mandelstam, Babel's arrest became the subject of an urban legend within the NKVD. NKVD agents, she explains, were fond of \"telling stories about the risks they ran\" in arresting \"enemies of the people\". Babel had, according to NKVD lore, \"seriously wounded one of our men\" while \"resisting arrest\". Mrs. Mandelstam contemptuously declared, \"Whenever I hear such tales I think of the tiny hole in the skull of Isaac Babel, a cautious, clever man with a high forehead, who probably never once in his life held a pistol in his hands.\"\n\nAccording to Peter Constantine, from the day of his arrest, Isaac Babel \"became a nonperson in the Soviet Union. His name was blotted out, removed from literary dictionaries and encyclopedias, and taken off school and university syllabi. He became unmentionable in any public venue. When the film director Mark Donskoi's famous Gorky trilogy premiered the following year, Babel, who had worked on the screenplay, had been removed from the credits.\"\n\nAccording to his file, \"Case #419, Babel, I.E.\", the writer was held at the Lubyanka and Butyrka Prisons for a total of eight months as a case was built against him for Trotskyism, terrorism, and spying for Austria and France. At his initial interrogations, \"Babel began by adamantly denying any wrongdoing, but then after three days he suddenly 'confessed' to what his interrogator was suggesting and named many people as co-conspirators. In all likelihood, he was tortured, almost certainly beaten.\" His interrogators included Boris Rodos, who had a reputation as a particularly brutal torturer, even by the standards of the time, and Lev Schwartzmann, who tortured the renowned theatre director, Vsevolod Meyerhold. Among those he accused of conspiring with him were his close friends Sergei Eisenstein, Solomon Mikhoels, and Ilya Ehrenburg.\n\nDespite months of pleading and letters sent directly to Beria, Babel was denied access to his unpublished manuscripts. In October 1939, Babel was again summoned for interrogation and denied all his previous testimony. A statement was recorded, \"I ask the inquiry to take into account that, though in prison, I committed a crime. I slandered several people.\" This led to further delays as the NKVD frantically attempted to salvage their cases against Mikhoels, Ehrenburg, and Eisenstein.\nOn 16 January 1940, Beria presented Stalin with a list of 457 'enemies of the party and the soviet regime' who were in custody, with a recommendation that 346, including Isaac Babel should be shot. According to Babel's daughter, Nathalie Babel Brown, his trial took place on January 26, 1940, in one of Lavrenti Beria's private chambers. It lasted about twenty minutes. The sentence had been prepared in advance and without ambiguity: death by firing squad, to be carried out immediately. He was shot at 1.30 am on 27 January 1940.\n\nBabel's last recorded words in the proceedings were, 'I am innocent. I have never been a spy. I never allowed any action against the Soviet Union. I accused myself falsely. I was forced to make false accusations against myself and others... I am asking for only one thing—let me finish my work.' He was shot the next day and his body was thrown into a communal grave. All of this information was revealed in the early 1990s.\n\nAccording to Simon Sebag Montefiore, Babel's ashes were buried with those of Nikolai Yezhov and several other victims of the Great Purge in a common grave at the Donskoy Cemetery. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a plaque was placed there which reads, \"Here lie buried the remains of the innocent, tortured, and executed victims of political repressions. May they never be forgotten.\" The grave of Yevgenia Yezhov, who committed suicide in a mental institution, lies less than twenty paces away.\n\nAccording to the early official Soviet version, Isaac Babel died in the Gulag on March 17, 1941. Peter Constantine, who translated Babel's complete writings into English, has described the writer's execution as \"one of the great tragedies of 20th century literature.\"\n\nOn December 23, 1954, during the Khrushchev thaw, a typed half sheet of paper ended the official silence. It read, \"The sentence of the military collegium dated 26 January 1940 concerning Babel, I.E., is revoked on the basis of newly discovered circumstances and the case against him is terminated in the absence of elements of a crime.\" Babel's works were once again widely published and praised. His public rehabilitation as a writer was initiated with the help of his friend and admirer Konstantin Paustovsky, and a volume of Babel's selected works was published in 1957 with a laudatory preface by Ilya Ehrenburg. New collections of selected works by Babel were published in 1966, 1989 and 1990. Still, certain \"taboo\" parts such as mentions of Trotsky were censored until the glasnost period shortly before the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The first collections of the complete works of Babel were prepared and published in Russia in 2002 and 2006.\n\nAfter his rehabilitation, Antonina Pirozhkova spent almost five decades campaigning for the return of Babel's manuscripts. These included Babel's translations of Sholem Aleichem's writings from Yiddish into Russian, as well as several unpublished short stories and novellas. According to Pirozhkova, As Babel put it, he worked on Sholem Aleichem to \"feed his soul.\" Other \"food for the soul\" came from writing new stories and the novella \"Kolya Topuz.\" He told me, \"I'm writing a novella in which the main character is a former Odessa gangster like Benia Krik. His name is Kolya Topuz and so far, at least, that's also the name of the novella. I want to show how this sort of man adapts to Soviet reality. Kolya Topuz works on a collective farm during collectivization, and then he goes to work in a Donbass coal mine. But since he has the mentality of a gangster, he's constantly breaking out of the limits of normal life, which leads to numerous funny situations.\" Babel spent a great deal of time writing, and he finished many works. Only his arrest prevented his new works from coming out.\"\n\nHowever, even requests by Ilya Ehrenburg and the Union of Soviet Writers produced no answers from the Soviet State. The truth was not revealed until the advent of Perestroika.\n\nAccording to Pirozhkova, \"In 1987, when so much was changing in our country, I again made an official request that the KGB search for Babel's manuscripts in its underground storage areas. In response to my request, I was visited by two KGB agents who informed me that the manuscripts had been burned. 'And so you've come in person to avoid giving me a written response to my request, am I correct?' 'How could you think such a thing? We came here to commiserate. We understand how precious Babel's manuscripts would be.'\"\n\nAfter her husband's return to Moscow in 1935, Yevgenia Gronfein Babel remained unaware of his other family with Antonina Pirozhkova. Based upon statements made by Ilya Ehrenburg, Yevgenia further believed that her husband was still alive and living in exile. In 1956, however, Ehrenburg told her of her husband's execution while visiting Paris. After also informing Mrs. Babel of her husband's daughter with Antonina Pirozhkova, Ehrenburg asked Yevgenia to sign a false statement attesting to a pre-war divorce from her husband. Enraged, Yevgenia Babel spat in Ehrenberg's face and then fainted.\n\nHer daughter, Nathalie Babel Brown, believes that Ehrenburg did this under orders from the KGB. With two potential contenders for the role of Babel's widow, the Soviet State clearly preferred Babel's common-law wife Antonina to his legal wife Yevgenia, who had emigrated to the West.\n\nAlthough Babel's play \"Maria\" was very popular at Western European colleges during the 1960s, it was not performed in Babel's homeland until 1994. The first English translation appeared in 1966 in a translation by Michael Glenny in THREE SOVIET PLAYS (Penguin) under the title \"Marya\". \"Maria\"'s American premiere, directed by Carl Weber, took place at Stanford University in 2004.\n\nAlthough she was too young to have many memories of her father, Nathalie Babel Brown went on to become one of the world's foremost scholars of his life and work. When a Norton Anthology of his writings was published in 2002, Nathalie edited the volume and provided a foreword. She died in Washington DC in 2005.\n\nAmerican writer Hubert Selby has called Babel \"the closest thing I have to a literary influence.\"\n\nAmerican writer James Salter has named Babel his favorite short-story writer. \"He has the three essentials of greatness: style, structure, and authority.\"\n\nAmerican writer George Saunders, when asked for a literary influence said \"There's a Russian writer named Isaac Babel that I love. I can drop in anywhere in his works, read a few pages, and go, Oh yeah, language. It's almost like if you were tuning a guitar and you heard a beautifully tuned one and you say, Yeah, that's what we want. We want something that perfect. When I read him, it recalibrates my ear. It reminds me of the difference between an OK sentence and a really masterful sentence. Babel does it for me.\"\nLydia Babel, the daughter of Isaac Babel and Antonina Pirozhkova, also emigrated to the United States and currently resides in Silver Spring, Maryland.\n\nBritish writer Bernard Kops wrote a poem, and later a play, about Babel: \"Whatever Happened to Isaac Babel?\"\n\nA memorial to Isaac Babel was unveiled on the north-west corner of the intersection of (V)ulitsa Rishelyevskaya and (V)ulitsa Zhukovskogo in Odessa in early September 2011, and, in conjunction with the inauguration of the memorial, a commemorative reading of three of his stories held, with musical interludes from the works of Isaac Schwartz, in the Philharmonic Hall in (V)ulitsa Pushkinskaya on September 6, 2011. The city also has an already existing (V)ulitsa Babelya (\"Babel Street\") in the Moldavanka.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "362258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=362258", "title": "It's Garry Shandling's Show", "text": "It's Garry Shandling's Show\n\nIt's Garry Shandling's Show is an American sitcom that was initially broadcast on Showtime from 1986 to 1990. It was created by Garry Shandling and Alan Zweibel. The series is notable for breaking the fourth wall.\n\nThe 30-minute series stars Garry Shandling as, more or less, himself: A neurotic, somewhat self-obsessed stand-up comedian who just happens to be aware he is a television sitcom character. Garry spends just as much time interacting with the studio audience as he does the regular cast members, offering up opening monologues and show-closing summations of the episode's events (much like George Burns on \"The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show\"). However, on Garry's show, all the supporting characters know they are on a TV show, not just Garry; and the studio audience is often in the storyline.\n\nAt the time of the series' production, Shandling actually lived in Sherman Oaks, California, just like the character on the series. His condominium on the series was styled to be just like his real-life condo, down to the room layout and the furnishings.\n\nStorylines were often manipulated by Shandling to create more favorable outcomes or simply to speed things along. One episode ended years later, for example. Another allowed Shandling to tell the audience that time had passed in order to console an angry neighbor whose wall he had damaged; by the time the scene transitioned, the workmen had already fixed the wall. On America's presidential election night in 1988, Showtime presented a live episode wherein Shandling brought in \"Soul Train\" host Don Cornelius to incorrectly announce that Michael Dukakis had soundly defeated George H. W. Bush.\n\nThe series' theme song was \"This is the Theme to Garry's Show\", sung by Los Angeles musician Bill Lynch. The song's lyrics are self-referential, explaining how the song came to be (\"Garry called me up and asked if I would write his theme song\") and asking what the listener thinks of it.\n\nConsidered a critical and niche success, \"It's Garry Shandling's Show\" ran 72 episodes and was on the air for four seasons (1986–1990). The show was later picked up by the broadcast Fox network from 1988 to 1990 as part of its Sunday night lineup with minor cuts for language and advertising breaks; Fox began airing the show from the beginning, but due to longer seasons for network shows versus cable, had caught up by the time the show left Fox in March 1990. New episodes continued for a few months thereafter on Showtime. The show introduced much of the country to Shandling and paved the way for his more successful run as Larry Sanders on HBO's \"The Larry Sanders Show\".\n\nThroughout the series, the cast was divided into the \"Starring\" cast, whose names were featured in the opening credits; the \"Co-Starring\" cast and the \"Guest Starring\" cast, both of which had the actors' names featured in the end credits.\n\n\n\nWhile fighting ovarian cancer, Gilda Radner guest-starred as herself in the series in 1988 in what would be her final television appearance. When Shandling asked her why she had not been seen on television for a while, Radner replied, \"Oh, I had cancer. What did \"you\" have?\"\n\nIn the United States, the series aired on Showtime: The first season aired on Wednesdays and the rest of the series aired on Sundays. It was originally picked up for 6 episodes. After the success of them, Showtime ordered 12 more (although only 10 were produced).\n\nTo bolster its Sunday night lineup, Fox secured the rights to air reruns of \"It's Garry's Shandling's Show\" not long after they aired on Showtime. The reruns aired Sundays on Fox at 9:00–9:30 from March 1988 to July 1989, at 9:30–10:00 in July 1989, at 10:00–10:30 from July to August 1989, and at 10:30–11:00 from August 1989 to March 1990.\n\nThe series was aired in the United Kingdom on BBC Two from 1987 to 1990.\n\nThe series was nominated for four Primetime Emmy Awards. It won five CableACE Awards (three for Best Comedy Series and two for Garry Shandling). It won an American Comedy Award for Funniest Male Performance in a Comedy Series-Cable or Syndicated, and an award for Outstanding Achievement in Comedy in 1988 from the Television Critics Association.\n\nOn October 20, 2009, Shout! Factory released \"It's Garry Shandling's Show: The Complete Series\" on DVD in Region 1. The 16-disc set features extensive bonus features including featurettes, commentaries and outtakes. \"Time\" praised the set's release, writing \"As self-referential comedies went, you never meta better one,\" while \"Entertainment Weekly\" named it one of the best TV on DVD releases of 2009. The first season of the series was released as a standalone title in America in April 2010.\n\nIn Region 2, Fabulous Films has released the first two seasons on DVD in the UK.\n\nIn Region 4, Shock Entertainment has released all 4 seasons on DVD in Australia.\n\n"}
{"id": "56708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56708", "title": "Keyboardist", "text": "Keyboardist\n\nA keyboardist or keyboard player is a musician who plays keyboard instruments. Until the early 1960s musicians who played keyboards were generally classified as either pianists or organists. Since the mid-1960s, a plethora of new musical instruments with keyboards have come into common usage, requiring a more general term for a person who plays them. These keyboards include:\n\n\nThere are many famous electronic keyboardists in metal, rock, pop and jazz music. A complete list can be found at List of keyboardists.\n\nThe use of electronic keyboards grew in popularity throughout the 1960s, with many bands using the Hammond organ, Mellotron, and electric pianos such as the Fender Rhodes. The Doors became the first group to use the Moog synthesizer on a pop record on 1967's \"Strange Days\". Other bands, including The Moody Blues, The Rolling Stones, and The Beatles would go on to add it to their records, both to provide sound effects and as a musical instrument in its own right. In 1966, Billy Ritchie became the first keyboard player to take a lead role in a rock band, replacing guitar, and thereby preparing the ground for others such as Keith Emerson and Rick Wakeman. In the late 1960s, a pioneer of modern electronic music Jean Michel Jarre started to experiment with synthesizers and other electronic devices. As synthesizers became more affordable and less unwieldy, many more bands and producers began using them, eventually paving the way for bands that consisted solely of synthesizers and other electronic instruments such as drum machines by the late 1970s/early 1980s. Some of the first bands that used this set up were Kraftwerk, Suicide and The Human League. Rock groups also began using synthesizers and electronic keyboards alongside the traditional line-up of guitar, bass and drums; particularly in progressive rock groups such as Genesis, Emerson, Lake & Palmer and Pink Floyd. The pop-blues-rock band Fleetwood Mac was also known for synthesizer-infused hits during this period.\n\nKeyboardists are often highly sought after in cover bands, to replicate the original keyboard parts and other instrumental parts such as strings or horns where it would be logistically difficult to hire people to play the actual instruments.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19186096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19186096", "title": "La Princesse", "text": "La Princesse\n\nLa Princesse is a 15-metre (50-foot) mechanical spider designed and operated by French performance art company La Machine. The spider was showcased in Liverpool, England, as part of the 2008 European Capital of Culture celebrations, travelling around the city between 3-7 September. In 2009, it was on display in Yokohama, Japan, as part of Yokohama's 150th anniversary of its port opening. Arts reviewer Lyn Gardner wrote in \"The Guardian\" \"There were times when it seemed to be leading the entire population of the city on a merry dance, like some kind of arachnid pied piper.\"\n\nThe spider was designed by La Machine's François Delarozière, who also designed the mechanical elephant and the giant girl for Royal de Luxe's performance of The Sultan's Elephant which visited London in May 2006. Both projects were brought to the UK by the company and charitable trust Artichoke. The spider was built in Nantes in France, using steel and poplar wood and complex hydraulics, and took an entire year to construct. It was shipped to Merseyside and assembled in a secret location, the Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead. It weighs 37 tonnes, has 50 axes of movement and is operated by up to 12 people strapped to its body. When operated, it moves at 2 miles per hour; to move it around the streets requires 16 cranes, six forklift trucks, eight cherry pickers and 250 crew. The spider had seven different special effects: rain, flame, smoke, wind, snow, light and sound. Street lights and a roundabout outside the Queensway Tunnel entrance were removed to allow its progress.\n\nThe performance artists of La Machine created a story about the spider with one member of the company playing scientist Joseph Browning who gave interviews to the press. The spider was followed by a full live band, housed in their own platforms on top of fortlift trucks and cherry pickers. The musicians played specially composed music by Dominique Malan, the special effects were designed by Thierry Loridant and the costumes were designed by Gaelle Choveau.\n\nOn Wednesday 3 September the spider appeared for the first time on the side of Concourse House, a derelict tower block in Lime Street, which had been designed by architect Richard Seifert and was scheduled for demolition.\n\nOn the morning of Friday 5 September, the spider moved to the Albert Dock, and it became active at lunchtime, moving in a small area and spraying the public with water. In the evening the spider travelled from the Albert Dock to the Cunard Building, via Salthouse Dock. A huge crowd turned out despite the heavy rain. The performance move around the Albert Dock and proceeded onto The Strand. The moving cordon of stewards surrounded the spider as it moved through the crowd. The spider sprayed water onto the crowds and interacted with members of the public. It then turned off the Strand and back into the Albert Dock. Here it paused and was lifted from its traction body by a huge crane and into Salthouse Dock, where it was sprayed (along with the crowd) by huge water cannons. After its 'bath' it returned to its traction body and walked along The Strand to its resting place for the night next to the Royal Liver Building. \n\nOn Saturday 6 September the spider was due to travel through the streets of Liverpool, 'walking' from the Cunard Building via Water Street, Castle St, Lord St, Parker St and Ranelagh Place back up to Concourse House. At 2:30 pm the Performance started with the spider ‘awakening’ and starting to walk up Water Street towards the city centre. Liverpool was crowded with its usual Saturday afternoon shopping crowd and the tens of thousands who had turned out to see the spider. The spider ‘walked’ through the middle of the Saturday shopping crowd, up through the city centre's streets, and right into the heart of the city's shopping district. The crowd was dispersed by the moving cordon around the spider. Local media reported that the scene was more representative of a victory parade of a football team or the crowds attracted by the Beatles to the city centre in their heyday. One bride could not get through the crowds to her wedding at the Town Hall and had to be helped through the crowd on foot by the police. The spider's musicians played an impromptu wedding march as they fought through the crowd. Various set pieces took place along the spider's route, involving smoke, fireworks and water cannon. The spider worked its way towards the main shopping area, passing Liverpool One. When the spider reached the centre of Lord Street, it was covered by a snow shower from above to make it go to sleep. It came to a rest at around 5 pm, taking a break before its further exploits that evening.\n\nThe next chapter of the story continued the same day and involved the city ‘fighting back’ and attempting to halt the path of the invading spider. At 7:30 pm the spider ‘awoke’ and continued to move up the main shopping street, Church Street. When it reached the top of the street it was met by a barrage of flame cannons. These consisted of long copper pipes, fired with high pressure gas. The heat and noise produced by this halted the spider in its tracks, while a mechanical digger moved in to attempt to fell the beast. The spider then changed its path to escape this and moved upwards towards Lime Street. Upon reaching Lime Street the spider was met by huge fans, which blew air to attempted to hold it back. The performance continued onwards towards Lime Street Station and the empty Concourse Tower, where it had first been sighted on Wednesday. A further barrage of flames stopped the spider from moving on any further and it turned towards the station. Cranes then moved in to lift it from its traction body and, with operators still on board, it started to moved into a vertical position. The spider then moved from one crane to another and amazingly attached itself to the side of the tower. A snow shower then engulfed the spider and it went to sleep for the evening.\n\nOn Sunday 7 September a large crowd of spectators went to the Concourse House to see it climb back down the building. The spider then crawled down the streets of Liverpool city centre, spraying the crowd with water. The spider then moved across St Georges Plateau amongst a huge crowd and down towards the Queensway Tunnel. Fireworks erupted from surrounding buildings as it passed. Watched by tens of thousands of people, it investigated the area outside the Queensway Tunnel's entrance, setting off huge water cannons and flames around the area, followed by hundreds of fireworks which detonated above the spider and the public. The spider then turned to face the crowd and moved backwards as it disappeared in a cloud of smoke into the tunnel entrance.\n\nThe project, which was free to the public, cost between £1.8 and £1.9 million to stage, of which £1.5 million came from the Liverpool Culture Company (in turn funded by the city, the Arts Council and the Department of Culture, Media and Sport). The cost of the project has been defended by Phil Redmond, who is responsible for the performance as Liverpool Culture Company's artistic director. He said \"At £1.5m I think it's actually cheaper than (booking) Macca (Sir Paul McCartney) and it has got us on the front of the South China Morning Post. So it's good value for money.\" However, the project has come in for criticism in some quarters: the UK mental health charity Anxiety has highlighted the potentially traumatic effect of the production upon those suffering with arachnophobia,\" and the TaxPayers' Alliance has called the artwork an \"outrageous waste of taxpayers' money\". The vast majority of the public response was positive, however, with most of the belief that \"The Liverpool Princesse's\" performance was the highlight of the city's Capital of Culture 2008 celebrations. On 8 September, \"BBC North West Tonight\", a regional news programme, revealed that plans were afoot to secure La Princesse to stay permanently in Liverpool, and talks had already been held with La Machine. \n\nAlthough the event was free to the public, there has been a shortfall of between £300,000 and £400,000 in funding for the project, exacerbated by the falling exchange rate with the Euro, the currency in which the French participants are paid. Artichoke has appealed for donations to help fund the project.\n\n\n"}

Although it is believed that the original function of coats of arms was to enable knights to identify each other on the battlefield, they soon acquired wider, more decorative uses. They are still widely used today by countries, public and private institutions and by individuals. The earliest writer on the law of arms was Bartolus de Saxoferrato. The officials who administer these matters are called pursuivants, heralds, or kings of arms (in increasing order of seniority). The law of arms is part of the law in countries which regulate heraldry, although not part of common law in England and in countries whose laws derive from English law.\n\nAccording to the usual description of the law of arms, coats of arms, armorial badges, flags and standards and other similar emblems of honour may only be borne by virtue of ancestral right, or of a grant made to the user under due authority. \"Ancestral right\" means descent in the male line from an ancestor who lawfully bore arms. \"Due authority\" has, since late medieval times, been the Crown or the State.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and Commonwealth, the Crown's prerogative of granting arms is delegated to one of several authorities depending on the country. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the authority to grant arms is delegated to the Kings of Arms of the College of Arms, under the direction of the Earl Marshal. In Scotland, this authority is delegated to Lord Lyon King of Arms at his or her own discretion. In Canada, it is exercised by Canadian Heraldic Authority under the direction of the Governor-General of Canada.\n\nIn Ireland, unlike the position in the United Kingdom, a grant of arms from an official authority is not a legal prerequisite to the use of arms. For example, heraldic symbols and coats of arms that existed pre-1552 and afterwards belonged to the Gaelic tradition may continue in use, as well as arms without any official basis.\n\nIn Spain, whilst the power to grant new arms is restricted to the king, the Cronistas de Armas (Chroniclers of Arms) have the power to certify arms within the province(s) of their appointment. As of 2008, there is currently only one, with authority only in the provinces of Castile and León.\n\nWhile the degree to which the general law recognises arms differs, in both England and Scotland a grant of arms confers certain rights upon the grantee and his (or her) heirs, even if they may not be easily protected. No person may lawfully have the same coat of arms as another person in the same heraldic jurisdiction although in England the bearing of identical arms without differencing marks by descendants from a common armigerous ancestor has been widespread and tolerated by the College of Arms.\n\nAlthough the common law courts do not regard coats of arms as either property or as being defensible by action, armorial bearings are a form of property nevertheless, generally described as \"tesserae gentilitatis\" or insignia of gentility. Armorial bearings are incorporeal and impartible hereditaments, inalienable, and descendable according to the law of arms. Generally speaking (there have been very rare examples of patents in which the arms are granted to descend with some different limitation), this means they are inherited by the issue (male and female) in the male line of the grantee, though they can be inherited as quarterings by the sons of an heraldic heiress, where there is no surviving male heir, provided her issue also have a right to bear arms in their own male line.\n\nIn Ireland the granting of arms to Irish citizens or to those who can prove Irish ancestry is considered to be a cultural tradition which is allowed through the Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland. This Office was established under the English Crown in 1552 as the Ulster King of Arms and was converted to the Chief Herald's Office after the 1937 Constitution of Ireland.\n\nThe Office of Chief Herald was given statutory force in the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997. However some doubts remained as to the effectiveness of the 1997 Act and proposals for further legislative amendment have been made by individual public representatives. For example, on 8 May 2006 Senator Brendan Ryan introduced the Genealogy & Heraldry Bill, 2006, in Seanad Éireann (Irish Senate) to this end.\n\nIn England and Wales, the law of arms is regarded as a part of the laws of England, and the common law courts will take judicial notice of it as such. These dignities, as they are called, have legal standing. But the law of arms is not part of the common law and the common law Courts have no jurisdiction over matters of dignities and honours, such as armorial bearings, or peerages. In this respect the law of arms was most influenced by the civil law and may be regarded as similar to the ecclesiastical law, which is a part of the laws of England influenced by canon law, but not part of the common law.\n\nIn England the exclusive jurisdiction of deciding rights to arms, and claims of descent, is vested in the Court of Chivalry. As the substance of the common law is found in the judgments of the common law Courts, so the substance of the Law of Arms can only be found in the customs and usages of the Court of Chivalry. However, the records of this are sparse, not least because the Court never gave reasoned judgments (the Lord Chief Justice who sat in 1954 offering the sole exception to this, no doubt because of his professional background as a common law Judge). The procedure was based on that of the civil law, but the substantive law was recognised to be English, and peculiar to the Court of Chivalry.\n\nUntil 1945 coats of arms (engravings, public paintings, etc.) were taxed, with no distinction made in the statute between arms granted by the College of Arms or those which were self-assumed.\n\nThe law of arms as understood in Scotland consists of two principal parts, the rules of heraldry (such as blazoning), and the law of heraldry. In contrast to the position in England, the Law of Arms is a branch of the civil law. A coat of arms is incorporeal heritable property, governed, subject to certain specialities, by the general law applicable to such property. The possession of armorial bearings is therefore unquestionably a question of property. The misappropriation of arms is a real injury, actionable under the common law of Scotland.\n\nThe Canadian law of arms is now regulated by the Canadian Heraldic Authority.\n\nIn Denmark the unlawful use of coats of arms and other insignia of Danish and foreign authorities is a criminal offence (Danish Criminal Code §§ 132-133). Non-official coats of arms are not protected. A specific rendition of a coat of arms is protected through copyright law and a coat of arms can be used as a trademark and will thus be protected by trademark law. There is no official heraldic authority for private arms in Denmark. Most insignia used by municipalities are regulated by the Heraldic Consultant to the Danish State (an office under the Danish National Archives). Registration by the Heraldic Consultant to the Danish State is a prerequisite for protection of official Danish insignia under the Criminal Code's §§ 132-133. Protection of an insignia in terms of trademark law requires registration by the trademark authorities. If an insignia is registered by the Heraldic Consultant, trademark rights are automatically acquired as well.\n\nDuring the Absolutist era, arms of nobility were granted by the King's herald, but this office was dissolved in 1849 when the absolutist era ended. Since then, the only way to acquire coats of arms in Denmark is through assumption.\n\nThe national arms and the royal arms arms sort under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and military arms are a matter of the heads of each branch of the Norwegian Armed Forces. The National Archives of Norway are the heraldic authority for the royal approbation of municipal arms. Public arms are protected by the Norwegian Penal Code, article 328. The same article prohibits as well unauthorised use of foreign public arms and some distinctive signs of international organizations.\n\nThere exists no official authority for private arms and the question of legal protection of private arms has not been asked to a Norwegian legal court. Personal arms, family arms and other private arms have been self assumed in Norway since the Middle Ages, without any grants, interference or protests from the public authorities.\n\nIn Germany the arms relate to a family, and so a name, and not to an individual. The right to the arms passes from the original bearer to those of his legitimate direct descendants by a male line. Since 1918 heraldic affairs are handled under the Civil Law. The right to arms is now considered analogous to the right to names, expressed in the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch § 12; this interpretation was confirmed in 1992 by the Federal Court of Justice of Germany. Thus, if one has the right to certain arms, that right is protected by the courts. Personal arms are protected as a part of the name if the arms are officially recorded and published.\n\nSpeaking very generally, Italian coats of arms may be said to be familial rather than personal. A formal system for indicating cadency is unknown outside the House of Savoy. In Italy there has been no official regulation of familial coats of arms or titles of nobility since abolition of the Consulta Araldica in 1948, and that body addressed itself primarily to state recognition of titles of nobility rather than the heraldry of untitled armigers such as nobili (untitled nobles) and patrizi (of the patriciates in the former city-states). Until the unification of the country in the decade leading to 1870, the issuance and use of familial coats of arms was exercised rather loosely in the various Italian states, with each region applying its own laws, and the principal focus was titles of nobility or (before circa 1800) feudal rights. Indeed, upon ennoblement, a count or baron not from an armigerous family might actually assume his own, original coat of arms without recourse to any authority. For this reason, actual grants of arms were very rare. There is no complete armory of Italian coats of arms, though certain authors, most importantly Giambattista Crollalanza, compiled references which appear to be nearly complete. Until the establishment of the republic (1946) and its constitution two years later, most coats of arms in Italy appertained to noble families, whether titled or not, although a number of blazons were identified with cittadini (burghers) whose families had used these for a century or more. The \"Blasonario\" contemplated by the Consulta Araldica would have been an official compilation of blazons (i.e. an armory) but, unfortunately, it was still in a very early draft stage when the monarchy fell in 1946. In 1967 the Constitutional Court ruled that nobiliary and heraldic matters were \"outside the scope of the law\". Italy's concordat with the Vatican in 1984, revising the Lateran Treaties, abrogated the article whereby Italy recognises Papal titles.\n\nUnder South African law, which is Roman–Dutch, all citizens have the right to assume and bear arms as they please, provided they do not infringe the rights of others (e.g. by bearing the same arms). The Bureau of Heraldry has the power to register coats of arms to protect against misuse, but registration of arms is voluntary.\n\nIn the United States protection of coats of arms is for the most part limited to specific units of the armed forces, with a few exceptions. George Washington, in personal correspondence, expressed opposition to establishment of a national heraldic authority, though he made use of his own ancestral arms. Personal coats of arms may be freely assumed but the right to these blazons is not protected in any way. It is possible that a coat of arms could be successfully protected as a trademark or service mark, but, in general, such protection is reserved for commercial use as a mark connected with a good or service, and not as a heraldic coat of arms. For example, the University of Texas at Austin has registered its emblem and coat of arms for use in its capacity as an institution of higher education. Moreover, such protection presumes a specific graphic design or work of art, while blazon is a description which may be widely interpreted artistically. A specific coat of arms could be protected by copyright as a pictorial, graphic or sculptural work. The usual requirements of originality and artistic creativity would need to be met; neither notice nor registration is required but may be advisable.\n\nIn England the officer with power to adjudicate on legal aspects of the law of arms is the Earl Marshal, whose court is known as the Court of Chivalry. The court was established some time prior to the late fourteenth century with jurisdiction over certain military matters, which came to include misuse of arms.\n\nIts jurisdiction and powers were successively reduced by the common law courts to the point where, after 1737, the Court ceased to be convened and was in time regarded as obsolete and no longer in existence. That understanding was authoritatively overturned, however, by a revival of the Court in 1954, when the Earl Marshal appointed the then Lord Chief Justice to sit as his surrogate. The Lord Chief Justice Lord Goddard confirmed that the Court retained both its existence and its powers, and ruled in favour of the suit before him.\n\nHowever, in his judgement (\"Manchester Corporation v Manchester Palace of Varieties\" [1955] P 133) Lord Goddard suggested that\n\nIn 1970, Arundel Herald Extraordinary advised Wolfson College, Oxford (who were considering whether to invoke a controversial University privilege in order to avoid paying for a grant of arms) that the effect of Lord Goddard’s dictum “must make any further sitting of the court unlikely even for a cause of instance; and the revival of causes of office, which were obsolescent even in the seventeenth century, would be more difficult still.” (quoted in “The Coat of Arms of Wolfson College Oxford” by Dr Jeremy Black \"The College Record\" 1989–90).\n\nIn 1984, Garter King of Arms declined to ask the Court to rule against the assumption of unauthorised arms by a local authority, doubting whether the precedents would give jurisdiction (\"A New Dictionary of Heraldry\" (1987) Stephen Friar p 63).\n\nHence, although the Law of Arms undoubtedly remains part of the law of England, and although the Court of Chivalry in theory exists as a forum in which it may be enforced, there is difficulty in enforcing the law in practice (a point made in \"Re Croxon, Croxon v Ferrers\" [1904] Ch 252, Kekewich J). The absence of a practical remedy for the illegal usurpation of arms in the law of England does not mean that there are no rights infringed, merely that it is not within the jurisdiction of the common law courts to act and that the court that is so empowered does not now sit.\n\nIn Scotland, Lord Lyon King of Arms is the judge of the Lyon Court, which has jurisdiction over all heraldic matters. An act of the Scottish parliament in 1592 made the unauthorised use of arms a criminal offence and gave Lyon the responsibility to prosecute such misuse, though in practice this might not be legal today. Unlike the Court of Chivalry, the Court of the Lord Lyon is very much alive, and is fully integrated into the Scottish legal system.\n\nIn England a grant of arms does not ennoble a grantee in itself, but is a recognition of rank or status and, therefore, an authoritative confirmation of it. An armiger (one who has the right to bear arms) is deemed to be of the status of a gentleman, and in England, many of the suits in the Court of Chivalry were decided on that basis. He may of course be of higher rank, as esquire, knight, peer, or prince.\n\nIn contrast, a coat of arms in Scotland is often, not without controversy, said to be a fief annoblissant, similar to a Scottish territorial peerage or barony. Under Sir Thomas Innes of Learney (Lord Lyon King of Arms 1945–1969), wording was introduced into every Scottish patent of arms which states that the grantee \"and his successors in the same are, amongst all Nobles and in all Places of Honour to be taken, numbered, accounted and received as Nobles in the Noblesse of Scotland\". These claims, strongly championed by Innes of Learney himself and by other writers, have now found broad acceptance amongst legal commentators as correctly representing the Law of Arms in Scotland (for example, \"The Stair Encyclopaedia of Scots Law\" (vol. 11, p. 548, para. 1613)), but are challenged by others, some of whom are reluctant to place a grant of arms on the same legal plane as a feudal barony or peerage.\n\nIn 2008, the so-called nobility clause seen in Scottish grants of arms since the days of Lord Lyon Innes of Learney was dropped and is no longer included in new grants of arms.\n\nOn the European continent, there is a clear difference between noble arms and burgher arms.\n\nIn most countries, scholars agree that a coat of arms is an indication of nobility, but that (in times past) simply assuming a coat of arms did not ennoble the armiger. In certain countries (viz. the Italian states pre-1860), armorial heraldry was not strictly regulated, while titles of nobility were.\n\nAs a generality, most nobles, whether titled or not, have coats of arms, hence the widely held perception of heraldry as an aristocratic trapping.\n\nWhile in the continent of Europe assumption of arms has mostly remained free, in some countries arms may not be assumed or changed at will. In particular, there is some basis for the claim that it is unlawful to assume arms in England and Wales without the authority of the Crown. This is the view of the College of Arms and is supported by some dicta in court cases, including \"In re Berens\", [1926] Ch. 596, 605–06, and \"Manchester Corporation v Manchester Palace of Varieties Ltd,\" [1955] P. 133 (the only modern decision of the Court of Chivalry). However, there is no holding by a modern court directly on point. For cases considering the question but not deciding it, see \"Austen v. Collins\", 54 L.T.R. 903 (Ch. 1886); \"In re Croxon\", [1904] Ch. 252.\n\nHowever, the assumption of arms has in every age been common, and became particularly so after the College of Arms ceased to obtain warrants to search out the illegal use of armory by roving enquiries known as the Visitations, the last of which took place at the end of the seventeenth century. The interpretation and application of modern legal principles (such as freedom of expression) have also influenced this, and the annual tax on coats of arms was repealed in 1945.\n\n\"Burke's General Armory\" (last edition 1884) is said to contain arms attributed to 60,000 families (\"The Upper Classes; Property and Privilege in Britain\" J. Scott (1982) p 91). But it has been calculated that there were only 9,458 armigerous families in 1798 (\"The Nobility of the English Gentry\" J. Lawrence (1824)) and a total of 8,320 grants of arms made in the 19th century (\"English Nobility: the Gentry, the Heralds and the Continental Context\" M J Sayer (1979)), which implies, albeit on an extremely rough and ready basis, about 40,000 assumptions of arms.\n\n"}
{"id": "28771373", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28771373", "title": "Lessing Theater", "text": "Lessing Theater\n\nThe Lessing Theater was a theatre in the Mitte district of Berlin, Germany. It opened in 1888 and was destroyed in April 1945 in a bombing raid; its ruins were demolished after World War II.\n\nThe construction of the theatre, for around 900,000 Mark, was especially notable since it was the first new theatre built in Berlin since the construction of the Wallner Theater in 1864; in between only renovations of old theatres and existing spaces had taken place. By order of director Oscar Blumenthal, the building, designed in a Renaissance Revival style by the architects Hermann von der Hude and Julius Hennicke, was constructed in less than a year, between October 1887 and September 1888. The theatre opened on 11 September 1888, staging Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's drama \"Nathan the Wise\".\n\nThe oddly angled piece of land, the site of former Circus Krembser, was located in the historic Friedrich-Wilhelm-Stadt quarter, at the corner of Friedrich-Karl-Ufer 1 (since 1951: Kapelle-Ufer) on the Spree riverside and Unterbaumstraße. Wedged between the Stadtbahn railway viaduct and the firewall of the building nextdoor, it made for a difficult design of a prestigious building. The architects designed a cupola above the podium that covered up the firewall, and the front facade with its portico turned the street corner into a kind of vestibule. The remaining triangular outside areas were set off from the street with lattice work and gates and functioned as gardens; the remaining area in the back served as delivery courtyard.\n\nThe location was commercially viable; the completion of the nearby Reichstag beyond the Spree River, linked by the \"Kronprinzenbrücke\", promised a future appreciation of land values. The horsecars which passed in front of the theatre made the theatre easily accessible from all neighbourhoods.\n\nThe staircases leading to the spectators' areas were combined with the rest of the house. Its function as a theatre was indicated by the facade's vestibule, the double pillars, and the gable. The towers with double arcades above the staircases were probably designed with an eye on the building's appearance from afar, but also emphasized the building's character. The middle part was dominated by the stalls, while the appearance from the rear was determined by the roof of the stage.\nSpectators entered the theatre through one of three doors in the vestibule, which was equipped with a roof to protect unloading horse cars. The lobby measured 15.40 by 9.00 metres. Ticket counters were placed on either side of the lobby, with doors beside them that gave access to the second storey balconies. Doors directly across from the entrance led to the stalls and the first level of balconies.\n\nAfter the show, spectators from the stalls left the theatre through two separate doors on the side of the theatre or through the main lobby. Spectators from the first and second rows of balconies had special exits through the staircases, so they would not have to cross the lobby again. This allowed the theatre to empty quickly and permitted shorter time periods between two shows.\n\nWardrobes were available outside the various spectator areas. The hallways also functioned as spectator space during intermissions. For the more prominent visitors, in the stalls and the first gallery, a separate foyer above the main lobby was allocated, a grand room, measuring 9.45 by 15.60 metres, and 6.80 metres high. During warmer seasons, doors opened up to a balcony above the vestibule and to balconies on either side of the corridors for the first gallery. Spectators in the second gallery had two bars available for beer, which also allowed access to an outside area.\n\nThe theater's first artistic director, Ernst von Possart, desired the basic dimensions of the spectator area be copied from Karl Friedrich Schinkel's Schauspielhaus because of its good acoustics. The hall had the shape of a lengthened semi circle with a radius of 18.46 metres, with a 5-metre deep proscenium, tapered from 13.90 to 11.50 metres. The hallways of the stalls were 1,00 metres above street level, those of the first gallery 4.70 metres, and those of the second gallery 8.40 metres. There were 1170 seats. With the exception of the left side of the first gallery, which contained the royal box, each gallery on both sides of the proscenium had two closed boxes each.\n\nIn the stalls, there were 18 boxes with 116 seats along the outer wall. 17 rows provided seating for 350 spectators; four rows with 58 second-class seats, below the first gallery balcony, were accessible via a central corridor. The seats measured 0.80 by 0.54 metres, at the time of the opening larger even than that of the Staatsoper Unter den Linden.\n\nThe first gallery largely consisted of boxes with a total of 140 seats. The five outside boxes on either side reached to the parapet; the ten boxes on the inside had three rows of seats in front of them (\"balcony seats\"), offering room for 72 spectators. The second gallery, besides the 28 seats in the proscenium boxes, offered seating in rows for 316 spectators and standing-room for 70 more.\n\nThe rococo-style auditorium was mainly white and gold. Rear walls were coloured bronze. All curtains and upholstery were blue silk.\n\nThe stage and adjacent areas were accessible via a ramp in the back, and through doors in the two staircases in the additions on either side. These side additions also had dressing rooms, on the ground floor. Dressing rooms for the choir and the extras were in the basement. Management was on the third floor, and costumes and props were stored on the floor above. The space behind the stage, two storeys high, served as storage for the sets; the third-story level housed furniture, and the fourth-storey level was the scene shop.\n\nThe stage measured , enough for six set changes. Tiefe ausreichend for six Kulissen. The Fly system was 18.00 meters above the stage. A two-part iron fire door closed the stage from the sides.\n\nThe building was constructed mainly from brick and iron, in hopes of minimising the risk of fire; only the stage was made of wood. The construction of a number of stairs in stone and the covering of the roofs and the cupola of the stage with sheet iron completed the precautions against fire. The flat roof over the rooms next to the stalls was done in cement. Lighting was electric.\n\nThe theatre was covered in plaster; only the ornaments of the outer facade were sandstone. For the facade, architects von der Hude and Hennick were inspired by Renaissance Revival architecture. For the inside, they opted for Mannerism, and the arena was inspired by Neorococo; in all, the plurality of styles made the theatre a typical representative of Historicism.\n\n\n\nThe following pieces were among the ones first performed in the Lessing Theater:\n\nUpon the Allied occupation of Berlin in 1945, the site in Mitte was located directly at the border of the Soviet sector with the British occupied borough of Tiergarten, from 1949 the demarcation line between East and West Berlin. In 1961 the premises between the Spree River and the Stadtbahn became part of the \"death strip\" on the Berlin Wall, with no obstacles remaining that would inhibit a sure shot on fugitives. On 18 February 1968 a couple trying to overcome the barriers nearby was killed by members of the East German Border Troops.\n\nAfter the Wall came down in the course of the 1989 Peaceful Revolution, the riverside was rebuilt as part of the new governmental district around the Reichstag parliament building, including the rebuilt \"Kronprinzenbrücke\" designed by Santiago Calatrava. From 2005 onwards, the cleared premises of the former theatre were used as \"Bundespressestrand\" restaurant, named after a neighbouring news conference building. After a temporarily appearance of the Occupy Berlin movement, the area since 2011 is the construction site of the new Berlin headquarters of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research.\n\n\n"}

This rather ineffective locomotive with only one driving axle was built in 1887 by the Hinkley Locomotive Works in Boston for the Swinerton Locomotive Driving Wheel Company.\n\nIn 1887 the Swinerton Locomotive Driving Wheel Company in the U.S.A. received a unique locomotive boldly called \"Onward\", which had been built by the Hinkley Locomotive Works of Boston. Its unique feature was that its wheels were not round. The company's founder, C. E. Swinerton, had specified that both driving wheels should actually polygons with 118 sides, each flat segment being about 2 inches (50mm) long. He wanted to prove that the line contact at the intersection of each segment would have better rail adhesion than a circular wheel, which was supposed to have only a point contact. However this was actually not the case as even steel deforms under enough pressure, so there is on fact a contact area even with a circular wheel.\n\nThe 4-2-2 locomotive had one single driving axle. This wheel arrangement had been abandoned elsewhere because of its poor adhesion. Probably it was chosen to emphasise the effectiveness of the invention. The \"Onward\" was tried on several north-eastern lines, but did not prove to be beneficial, and thus failed to convince practical railway men. It is likely that the non-constant radius would have caused tremendous amount of vibration.\n\nIt was sold to the Portland and Rochester Railroad, after the polygonal driving wheels had been replaced with conventional round ones. After a few years the P & R sent it to the Manchester Locomotive Works for reconstruction as an ordinary eight-wheeler. \"Onward\" was cut up for scrap in 1905.\n"}

{"id": "230487", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=230487", "title": "Poincaré group", "text": "Poincaré group\n\nThe Poincaré group, named after Henri Poincaré (1906), was first defined by Minkowski (1908) as the group of Minkowski spacetime isometries. It is a ten-dimensional non-abelian Lie group of fundamental importance in physics.\n\nA Minkowski spacetime isometry has the property that the interval between events is left invariant. For example, if everything was postponed by two hours, including the two events and the path you took to go from one to the other, then the time interval between the events recorded by a stop-watch you carried with you would be the same. Or if everything was shifted five kilometres to the west, or turned 60 degrees to the right, you would also see no change in the interval. It turns out that the proper length of an object is also unaffected by such a shift. A time or space reversal (a reflection) is also an isometry of this group.\n\nIn Minkowski space (i.e. ignoring the effects of gravity), there are ten degrees of freedom of the isometries, which may be thought of as translation through time or space (four degrees, one per dimension); reflection through a plane (three degrees, the freedom in orientation of this plane); or a \"boost\" in any of the three spatial directions (three degrees). Composition of transformations is the operator of the Poincaré group, with proper rotations being produced as the composition of an even number of reflections.\n\nIn classical physics, the Galilean group is a comparable ten-parameter group that acts on absolute time and space. Instead of boosts, it features shear mappings to relate co-moving frames of reference.\n\nPoincaré symmetry is the full symmetry of special relativity. It includes:\n\nThe last two symmetries, J and K, together make the Lorentz group (see also Lorentz invariance); the semi-direct product of the translations group and the Lorentz group then produce the Poincaré group. Objects which are invariant under this group are then said to possess Poincaré invariance or relativistic invariance.\n\nThe Poincaré group is the group of Minkowski spacetime isometries. It is a ten-dimensional noncompact Lie group. The abelian group of translations is a normal subgroup, while the Lorentz group is also a subgroup, the stabilizer of the origin. The Poincaré group itself is the minimal subgroup of the affine group which includes all translations and Lorentz transformations. More precisely, it is a semidirect product of the translations and the Lorentz group, \nwith group multiplication\n\nAnother way of putting this is that the Poincaré group is a group extension of the Lorentz group by a vector representation of it; it is sometimes dubbed, informally, as the inhomogeneous Lorentz group. In turn, it can also be obtained as a group contraction of the de Sitter group SO(4,1) ~ Sp(2,2), as the de Sitter radius goes to infinity.\n\nIts positive energy unitary irreducible representations are indexed by mass (nonnegative number) and spin (integer or half integer) and are associated with particles in quantum mechanics (see Wigner's classification).\n\nIn accordance with the Erlangen program, the geometry of Minkowski space is defined by the Poincaré group: Minkowski space is considered as a homogeneous space for the group.\n\nIn quantum field theory, the universal cover of the Poincaré group\nand the double cover\nare more important, because representations of formula_5 are not able to describe fields with spin 1/2, i.e. fermions. Here formula_6 is the group of complex formula_7 matrices with unit determinant.\n\nThe Poincaré algebra is the Lie algebra of the Poincaré group. It is a Lie algebra extension of the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group. More specifically, the proper (det\"Λ\"=1), orthochronous () part of the Lorentz subgroup (its identity component), SO(1, 3), is connected to the identity and is thus provided by the exponentiation of this Lie algebra. In component form, the Poincaré algebra is given by the commutation relations:\n\nwhere is the generator of translations, is the generator of Lorentz transformations, and is the (+,−,−,−) Minkowski metric (see Sign convention).\n\nThe bottom commutation relation is the (\"homogeneous\") Lorentz group, consisting of rotations, , and boosts, . In this notation, the entire Poincaré algebra is expressible in noncovariant (but more practical) language as\nwhere the bottom line commutator of two boosts is often referred to as a \"Wigner rotation\". Note the important simplification , which permits reduction of the Lorentz subalgebra to su(2)⊕su(2) and efficient treatment of its associated representations.\n\nThe Casimir invariants of this algebra are and where is the Pauli–Lubanski pseudovector; they serve as labels for the representations of the group.\nThe Poincaré group is the full symmetry group of any relativistic field theory. As a result, all elementary particles fall in representations of this group. These are usually specified by the \"four-momentum\" squared of each particle (i.e. its mass squared) and the intrinsic quantum numbers , where is the spin quantum number, is the parity and is the charge-conjugation quantum number. In practice, charge conjugation and parity are violated by many quantum field theories; where this occurs, and are forfeited. Since CPT symmetry is invariant in quantum field theory, a time-reversal quantum number may be constructed from those given.\n\nAs a topological space, the group has four connected components: the component of the identity; the time reversed component; the spatial inversion component; and the component which is both time-reversed and spatially inverted.\n\nThe definitions above can be generalized to arbitrary dimensions in a straightforward manner. The d-dimensional Poincaré group is analogously defined by the semi-direct product\n\nwith the analogous multiplication\n\nThe Lie algebra retains its form, with indices and now taking values between and . The alternative representation in terms of and has no analogue in higher dimensions.\n\nA related observation is that the representations of the Lorentz group include a pair of inequivalent two-dimensional complex spinor representations formula_17 and formula_18 whose tensor product formula_19 is the adjoint representation. One may identify this last bit with four-dimensional Minkowski space itself (as opposed to identifying it with a spin-1 particle, as would normally be done for a pair of fermions, e.g. a pion being composed of a quark-anti-quark pair). This strongly suggests that it might be possible to extend the Poincaré algebra to also include spinors. This leads directly to the notion of the super-Poincaré algebra. The mathematical appeal of this idea is that one is working with the fundamental representations, instead of the adjoint representations. The physical appeal of this idea is that the fundamental representations correspond to fermions, which are seen in nature. So far, however, the implied supersymmetry here, of a symmetry between spatial and fermionic directions, cannot be seen experimentally in nature. The experimental issue can roughly be stated as the question: if we live in the adjoint representation (Minkowski spacetime), then where is the fundamental representation hiding?\n\n\n"}

The Ancient Greek \"prólogos\" included the modern meaning of \"prologue\", but was of wider significance, more like the meaning of preface. The importance, therefore, of the prologue in Greek drama was very great; it sometimes almost took the place of a romance, to which, or to an episode in which, the play itself succeeded.\n\nIt is believed that the prologue in this form was practically the invention of Euripides, and with him, as has been said, it takes the place of an explanatory first act. This may help to modify the objection which criticism has often brought against the Greek prologue, as an impertinence, a useless growth prefixed to the play, and standing as a barrier between us and our enjoyment of it. The point precisely is that, to an Athenian audience, it was useful and pertinent, as supplying just what they needed to make the succeeding scenes intelligible. But it is difficult to accept the view that Euripides invented the plan of producing a god out of a machine to justify the action of deity upon man, because it is plain that he himself disliked this interference of the supernatural and did not believe in it. He seems, in such a typical prologue as that to the \"Hippolytus\", to be accepting a conventional formula, and employing it, almost perversely, as a medium for his ironic rationalism.\n\nMany of the existing Greek prologues may be later in date than the plays they illustrate, or may contain large interpolations. On the Latin stage the prologue was often more elaborate than it was in Athens, and in the careful composition of the poems which Plautus prefixes to his plays we see what importance he gave to this portion of the entertainment; sometimes, as in the preface to the \"Rudens\", Plautus rises to the height of his genius in his adroit and romantic prologues, usually placed in the mouths of persons who make no appearance in the play itself.\n\nMolière revived the Plautian prologue in the introduction to his \"Amphitryon\". Racine introduced Piety as the speaker of a prologue which opened his choral tragedy of Esther.\n\nThe tradition of the ancients vividly affected our own early dramatists. Not only were the mystery plays and miracles of the Middle Ages begun by a homily, but when the drama in its modern sense was inaugurated in the reign of Elizabeth, the prologue came with it, directly adapted from the practice of Euripides and Terence. Sackville, Lord Buckhurst, prepared a sort of prologue in dumb show for his \"Gorboduc\" of 1562; and he also wrote a famous Induction, which is, practically, a prologue, to a miscellany of short romantic epics by diverse hands.\n\nPrologues of Renaissance drama often served a specific function of transition and clarification for the audience. A direct address made by one actor, the prologue acted as an appeal to the audience's attention and sympathy, providing historical context, a guide to themes of the play, and occasionally, a disclaimer . In this mode, a prologue, like any scripted performance, would exist as the text, the actor who speaks that text, and the presentation of the language as it is spoken. In ushering the audience from the reality into the world of the play, the prologue straddles boundaries between audience, actors, characters, playwrights--basically, it creates a distinction between the imaginary space within the play and the outside world. Ben Jonson has often been noted as using the prologue to remind the audience of the complexities between themselves and all aspects of the performance.\n\nThe actor reciting the prologue would appear dressed in black, a stark contrast to the elaborate costumes used during the play. The prologue removed his hat and wore no makeup. He may have carried a book, scroll, or a placard displaying the title of the play. He was introduced by three short trumpet calls, on the third of which he entered and took a position downstage. He made three bows in the current fashion of the court, and then addressed the audience.\nThe Elizabethan prologue was unique in incorporating aspects of both classical and medieval traditions. In the classical tradition, the prologue conformed to one of four subgenres: the \"sustatikos\", which recommends either the play or the poet; the \"epitimetikos\", in which a curse is given against a rival, or thanks given to the audience; \"dramatikos\", in which the plot of the play is explained; and mixtos, which contains all of these things. In the medieval tradition, expressions of morality and modesty are seen, as well as a meta-theatrical self-consciousness, and an unabashed awareness of the financial contract engaged upon by paid actors and playwrights, and a paying audience.\n\nPrologues have long been used in non-dramatic fiction, since at least the time of Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\", although Chaucer had prologues to many of the tales, rather than one at the front of the book.\n\n\n"}

The 2.03 m (6 foot 7 inch) by 3.58 m (11 foot 9 inch) canvas was started in 1880 and finished in 1891. Repin recorded the years of work along the lower edge of the canvas. Alexander III bought the painting for 35,000 rubles, at the time the greatest sum ever paid for a Russian painting. Since then, the canvas has been exhibited in the State Russian Museum in Saint Petersburg. \n\n\"Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks\" depicts a supposedly historical tableau, set in 1676, and based on the legend of Cossacks sending a reply to an ultimatum of the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, Mehmed IV. The original reply, if it ever existed, has not survived; however, in the 1870s an amateur ethnographer from Yekaterinoslav (today Dnipro), Ya. Novitsky, found a copy made in the 18th century. He gave it to historian Dmytro Yavornytsky (1855-1940), who by chance read it to his guests, among whom was the painter Ilya Repin. Repin became curious about the story and in 1880 started the first of his studies.\n\nAccording to the story, the Zaporozhian Cossacks (from 'beyond the rapids', Ukrainian: \"za porohamy\"), inhabiting the lands around the lower Dnieper River in Ukraine, had defeated Ottoman Empire forces in battle. However, Mehmed demanded that the Cossacks submit to Turkish rule. The Cossacks, led by Ivan Sirko, replied in an uncharacteristic manner: they wrote a letter, replete with insults and profanities. The painting exhibits the Cossacks' pleasure at striving to come up with ever more base vulgarities. During Repin's time, the Cossacks enjoyed great popular sympathy. Repin also admired them: \"All that Gogol wrote about them is true! A holy people! No one in the world held so deeply freedom, equality, and fraternity.\"\n\nSultan Mehmed IV to the Zaporozhian Cossacks:\n\nAs the Sultan; son of Muhammad; brother of the sun and moon; grandson and viceroy of God; ruler of the kingdoms of Macedonia, Babylon, Jerusalem, Upper and Lower Egypt; emperor of emperors; sovereign of sovereigns; extraordinary knight, never defeated; steadfast guardian of the tomb of Jesus Christ; trustee chosen by God Himself; the hope and comfort of Muslims; confounder and great defender of Christians - I command you, the Zaporogian Cossacks, to submit to me voluntarily and without any resistance, and to desist from troubling me with your attacks.\n\n--Turkish Sultan Mehmed IV\nThe Cossacks' reply came as a stream of invective and vulgar rhymes, parodying the Sultan's titles:\n\nZaporozhian Cossacks to the Turkish Sultan!\n\nO sultan, Turkish devil and damned devil's kith and kin, secretary to Lucifer himself. What the devil kind of knight are thou, that canst not slay a hedgehog with your naked arse? The devil shits, and your army eats. Thou shalt not, thou son of a whore, make subjects of Christian sons; we have no fear of your army, by land and by sea we will battle with thee, fuck thy mother.\n\nThou Babylonian scullion, Macedonian wheelwright, brewer of Jerusalem, goat-fucker of Alexandria, swineherd of Greater and Lesser Egypt, pig of Armenia, Podolian thief, catamite of Tartary, hangman of Kamyanets, and fool of all the world and underworld, an idiot before God, grandson of the Serpent, and the crick in our dick. Pig's snout, mare's arse, slaughterhouse cur, unchristened brow, screw thine own mother!\n\nSo the Zaporozhians declare, you lowlife. You won't even be herding pigs for the Christians. Now we'll conclude, for we don't know the date and don't own a calendar; the moon's in the sky, the year with the Lord, the day's the same over here as it is over there; for this kiss our arse!\n\n- Koshovyi otaman Ivan Sirko, with the whole Zaporozhian Host.\n\nWhile working on the original version, Repin in 1889 began work on a second version. This work he never finished. The second version of \"The Cossacks\" the artist tried to make more \"historically authentic\". In 1932 it was presented by the Tretyakov Gallery to the . In 1935, it was moved to the , where it is now stored. This canvas is slightly smaller than the original version. Vladimir Gilyarovsky, a popular journalist of partial Cossack descent, was one of the models who posed for Repin.\n\n\nSeveral full-size copies of the Repin painting exist, including a famous reproduction by Pavel Porfirov (Repin's student), currently held by the Cincinnati Art Museum.\n\n\n"}

Key information categories include: \n\nThe objectives of software visualization are to support the understanding of software systems (i.e., its structure) and algorithms (e.g., by animating the behavior of sorting algorithms) as well as the analysis and exploration of software systems and their anomalies (e.g., by showing classes with high coupling) and their development and evolution. One of the strengths of software visualization is to combine and relate information of software systems that are not inherently linked, for example by projecting code changes onto software execution traces.\n\nSoftware visualization can be used as tool and technique to explore and analyze software system information, e.g., to discover anomalies similar to the process of visual data mining. For example, software visualization is used to monitoring activities such as for code quality or team activity. Visualization is inherently not a method for software quality assurance. Software visualization participates to Software Intelligence in allowing to discover and take advantage of mastering inner components of software systems.\n\nTools for software visualization might be used to visualize source code and quality defects during software development and maintenance activities. There are different approaches to map source code to a visual representation such as by software maps Their objective includes, for example, the automatic discovery and visualization of quality defects in object-oriented software systems and services. Commonly, they visualize the direct relationship of a class and its methods with other classes in the software system and mark potential quality defects. A further benefit is the support for visual navigation through the software system.\n\nMore or less specialized graph drawing software is used for software visualization. A small-scale 2003 survey of researchers active in the reverse engineering and software maintenance fields found that a wide variety of visualization tools were used, including general purpose graph drawing packages like GraphViz and GraphEd, UML tools like Rational Rose and Borland Together, and more specialized tools like Visualization of Compiler Graphs (VCG) and Rigi. The range of UML tools that can act as a visualizer by reverse engineering source is by no means short; a 2007 book noted that besides the two aforementioned tools, ESS-Model, BlueJ, and Fujaba also have this capability, and that Fujaba can also identify design patterns.\n\n\n\n\n"}

A date of around 1516 has been established by means of dendrochronological research. The central panel, signed \"Jheronimus Bosch\", measures 135 by 200 centimeters and the wings measure 147 × 66 cm. The outside shutters feature a version of Bosch's \"The Wayfarer\".\n\nThe painting was part of a group of six acquired by king Philip II of Spain in 1570, and shipped to El Escorial four years later. It was later sold to the Marquis of Salamanca, and divided into three paintings. In 1848, the central panel was bought by Isabella II of Spain and brought to Aranjuez, the right one was returned to Escorial and the left went to the Prado. The triptych was finally recomposed in 1914 in the latter museum. A copy exists at the Escorial.\n\nThe exterior of the shutters, like most contemporary Netherlandish triptychs, were also painted, although in this case Bosch used full colors instead of the usual grisaille. When closed, they form a single scene depicting a wayfarer. Around him is a series of miniatures including the robbery of another wayfarer and a hanged man. The man uses a stick to repel a dog.\n\nAccording to the most recent interpretations, this figure may represent the man who follows his road in spite of the temptation of sins (such as lust, perhaps symbolized by the two dancing shepherds) and the evil acts occurring around him.\n\nThe Haywain triptych follows a similar narrative to \"The Garden of Earthly Delights\". The left panel shows God giving form to Eve. Unlike the \"Garden\", though, a narrative sequence flows through the panel in different scenes. At the top, the rebel angels are cast out of Heaven while God sits enthroned, the angels turning into insects as they break through the clouds. Below this, God creates Eve from the rib of Adam. Next, Adam and Eve find the serpent and the tree; the serpent offers them an apple. Finally, at the lowest part of the panel, the angel forces the two out of the Garden of Eden. Adam speaks with the angel; Eve, in a melancholic pose, looks ahead to the right.\n\nThe central panel features a large wagon of hay surrounded by a multitude of fools engaged in a variety of sins, quite apart from the sins of lust which dominates the \"Garden of Earthly Delights\". In the center panel Bosch shows Christ in the sky, not paralleled in the \"Garden\". An angel on top of the wagon looks to the sky, praying, but none of the other figures see Christ looking down on the world. The rightward bow of the figures around the wagon provides the force for the viewer’s eye to move with them on their journey and the cart is drawn by infernal beings which drag everyone to Hell, depicted on the right panel.\n\nThe forward kinetic motion of the participants moves the viewer from present-day sin into unadulterated torture in the realms of Hell. The procession on the left side of this panel bends back into the middle ground, but the right side figures continue in a straight line with the wagon, a more evident progress into damnation.\n\nThe triptych was thoroughly investigated by the scientists at the Bosch Research and Conservation Project with the results published in book form. Bosch's palette was rather limited with pigments including azurite, lead-tin yellow, vermilion and ochres.\n\n"}

The raised arms of the standing Buddy Bears are aligned on the dissemination of friendliness and optimism, and thus mediate a positive mood. \"The Buddy Bear has become an unofficial ambassador for Germany and is a symbol of Berlin since 2001. The story of the Buddy Bears started with an artistic event in Berlin in 2001. Inspired by the idea of bringing art in the streets of a metropolis like the cow parade in Zurich and New York.\" In addition to the Classic Buddy Bears presented far beyond Berlin’s city limits, the circle of United Buddy Bears came into being in 2002. The Exhibition travel around the world promoting \"peace, international understanding and tolerance among the nations, cultures and religions of this world\".\n\nThe first activities were presented as the \"Buddy Bear Berlin Show\". In 2001, artists painted approximately 350 bears to appear in the public domain, as decorative elements in the streets of Berlin. Four different bear designs (one standing on all four paws, one standing on two legs, one standing on its head and one in a sitting position) took part in this activity in the city centre of Berlin. Afterwards, many of the bears were sold at auctions in aid of child relief organisations. Nowadays, these Berlin Buddy Bears are exclusively presented on private premises, in front of hotels and embassies as well as in the foyers of various office buildings.\n\nThere have already been exhibitions of the original \"Buddy Bears\" — designed by local artists — in the cities of Shanghai (2004), Buenos Aires (2005) and St. Gallen / Switzerland (2006).\n\n\"United Buddy Bears\" is an international art exhibition with more than 140 two metre tall fiberglass bears. Under the motto: \"We have to get to know each other better, it makes us understand one another better, trust each other more, and live together more peacefully\", more than 140 countries acknowledged by the United Nations are represented, promoting \"tolerance, international understanding and the great concept of different nations and cultures living in peace and harmony\". The bears stand \"hand in hand\" in a \"peaceful circle\" (The Art of Tolerance).\n\nThe bears were on display between June and November 2002, in a circle around the Brandenburg Gate. Around 1.5 million people visited this first exhibition.\n\nOn 6 November 2002, the bears were moved to new locations, including their respective countries embassies in Berlin, or back to country that they were based on. Some of the bears were auctioned off to raise money for UNICEF.\n\nAfter the circle of \"United Buddy Bears\" had been such an overwhelming success in 2002, a new circle was created in 2003. The idea was to send the circle on a global tour.\n\nOn their global tour, the \"United Buddy Bears\" promote peace, love, tolerance and international understanding. The circle changes every time it reaches a new city. This is not only due to the local conditions, but also to their constantly changing order, as the bears are always set up in alphabetic order, following the local language of the host country. This always leads to new and sometimes politically very interesting proximities.\n\nEntry to the exhibitions is always free. This makes it possible for many school classes to visit the exhibitions in the morning — as part of their lessons — to explore and learn a lot about the culture, history, landscape, economy and music of all five continents in a playful manner. During past exhibitions more than 40 million visitors have already admired the colorful United Buddy Bears.\n\nIn every metropolis, the United Buddy Bears exhibitions are supported by the government, the foreign ministries, the mayors and the UNICEF organisations. Heads of state – for example the Japanese Prime Minister, Junichiro Koizumi, the German Federal President, Horst Köhler and First Lady of Egypt, Suzanne Mubarak as well as UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors such as Sir Peter Ustinov, Jackie Chan, Christiane Hörbiger, Mia Farrow, Iris Berben and Ken Done have opened these exhibitions all over the world. \"United Buddy Bears Special Ambassador\" is the actress Dennenesch Zoudé.\n\nThe bears have been displayed at the following Stations since the beginning of the tour:\n\n\nIn the autumn of 2003, the circle of \"United Buddy Bears-The Minis\" — was presented in Berlin for the first time. Since then, this circle has been shown in Frankfurt/Main, in Potsdam and at the Sony Center in Berlin — to name just a few locations. Since 2012, they have also been travelling to destinations outside of Germany, e.g. Bratislava in , Borås in , Calais in and in in Yekaterinburg and Kazan.\n\nBuddy Bear activities and help for children in need have formed an inseparable unit. New \"United Buddy Bears\" are often designed to replace the previous unique sculpture of a particular country. Many countries are already represented with the third or fourth bear. The previous bears designed on behalf of the respective countries are generally sold at auctions.\n\nIn the early years, the Bears were designed by regional artists and Berlin celebrities for the exhibition \"Art in the City\". From 2002 onwards, thanks to support from Lufthansa, Air Berlin and the , artists from all five continents took part in the\ninternational project \"United Buddy Bears\". More than 240 artists from over 150 countries have taken part in this project to date, such as, for example Arik Brauer, René Cadena Ayala, , Ibrahim Hazimeh, Carlos Páez Vilaró, Seo Soo-Kyoung, , Leda Luss Luyken, Ludmila Seefried-Matějková – this is also echoed by the artist and UNICEF Australian National Ambassador, Ken Done.\n\n\n"}
