The name was originally simply the 56 Group: \"Wales\" was added in 1967, in response to a feeling that the organisation's \"Welsh origins ought to be re-affirmed\". The Welsh-language version of the name was first used on publicity in 1976.\n\nThe post-war art establishment in Wales was still very conservative and moves had been afoot since the late 1930s to create a modern art group. In March 1956, following a failed attempt to become a \"South Wales Academy of Art\", a \"rebellion\" took place within the ranks of the \"South Wales Group\" and the \"56 Group\" was established. Artists Eric Malthouse, David Tinker and Michael Edmonds were the leading instigators. They circulated a statement of purpose and aims and an invitation to join the group to ten leading Welsh artists.\n\nOf those invited to join, nine accepted: Trevor Bates, Hubert Dalwood, George Fairley, Arthur Giardelli, Robert Hunter, Heinz Koppel, Will Roberts, John Wright and Ernest Zobole. Brenda Chamberlain, the only female artist invited, declined.\n\nAlthough all twelve of the founder-members worked in a broadly modernist and internationalist idiom, they did not share a recognisably common style or ideology. Their average age was 36; and ten worked as art lecturers (Roberts and Edmonds did not). Only two, Roberts and Zobole, had been born in Wales: Fairley was born in Scotland, Koppel in Germany and the others in England.\n\nThe 56 Group has always been essentially an exhibiting association of artists who retain their own independence and individuality. The group's first exhibition was held at Worcester Museum and Art Gallery in June 1957, and versions of the same exhibition were held later the same year at the National Museum of Wales and Tenby Civic Centre. It subsequently exhibited widely in both Wales and England. Its first continental exhibition was held in Amsterdam in 1967, and later exhibitions went to Nantes in 1974–5, Bologna in 1983, Czechoslovakia in 1986–7 and again in 1991, and Libramont, Belgium, in 1994. An exhibition of modern Welsh art held at the Jefferson Place Gallery, Washington, D.C. in 1965, although not formally associated with the Group, included work by several of its members. By 2012, the Group's 56th anniversary year, it could claim to have had a total of 88 full members (plus a number of guest, associate and honorary members); and to have held 225 exhibition showings.\n\nPainter, sculptor and teacher Arthur Giardelli was the chair of the Group from 1961 to 1998. Some of its success – exhibitions and tours outside Wales – have been attributed to his language skills and European outlook.\n\nIn 2012, marking the 56th anniversary of the group's formation, a touring exhibition visited galleries around Wales. Called \"The 56 Group Wales: The Founders\", it includes artworks of the twelve original founders, as well as work from current members. For the previous ten years, businessman Barrie Maskell had spent time tracking down and purchasing work made by each of the twelve original members. This included a visit to one of the surviving founders, John Wright, who was living in Spain. Fifty-six of Maskell's paintings were chosen for the exhibition. The exhibition was shown at venues in Pontypridd, Cardiff and MOMA Wales in Machynlleth. In the same year, a history of the Group's first 56 years by David Moore was published.\n\nIn January 2013 a touring exhibition of the group's work, \"56:56\", opened at Newport Art Gallery.\n\nThe Group's activities have not always been eulogised. Will Roberts, one of the founder members, who was afterwards (in 1964) asked to withdraw from exhibitions because his work was seen as insufficiently radical, later dismissed the Group as having been \"set up by art school teachers who wanted to sell their work\". When Rollo Charles, keeper of art at the National Museum of Wales, commented in 1976 that the Group \"is now generally regarded as the official avant garde of Welsh art\", critic Bryn Richards responded \"[t]his must seem to those who founded the group, with such hope, as a veritable kiss of death\". Renowned Welsh artist Kyffin Williams was reported in 1981 to have had a strong antipathy for what he described as a group of \"predominantly abstract painters or English carpetbaggers, ... who came down to Wales because they could not make it in the metropolis. The 56 Group has taken over Welsh art, and he [Williams] is out of favour in his homeland as a result.\"\n\nWikipedia articles are available on the following members and ex-members:\n\n"}
{"id": "1670635", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1670635", "title": "Amor Vincit Omnia (Caravaggio)", "text": "Amor Vincit Omnia (Caravaggio)\n\nAmor Vincit Omnia (\"Love Conquers All\", known in English by a variety of names including Amor Victorious, Victorious Cupid, Love Triumphant, Love Victorious, or Earthly Love) is a painting by the Italian Baroque artist Caravaggio. \n\n\"Amor Vincit Omnia\" shows Amor, the Roman Cupid, wearing dark eagle wings, half-sitting on or perhaps climbing down from what appears to be a table. Scattered around are the emblems of all human endeavours – violin and lute, armour, coronet, square and compasses, pen and manuscript, bay leaves, and flower, tangled and trampled under Cupid’s foot. The painting illustrates the line from Virgil's \"Eclogues\" X.69, \"Omnia vincit amor et nos cedamus amori\" (\"Love conquers all; let us all yield to love!\"). A musical manuscript on the floor shows a large \"V\". It has therefore been suggested also that the picture is a coded reference to the attainments of Marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani: his Genoese family ruled Chios (until the island's capture by the Turks) in 1622, hence the coronet; the cultivated Marchese also wrote about music and painting (pen, manuscript and musical instruments), was constructing an imposing new palazzo (geometrical instruments), studied astronomy (astral sphere), and was praised for his military prowess (armour). The symbology thus holds the possible reading: Vincenzo Conquers All. Giustiniani is said to have prized it above all other works in his collection.\n\nThe subject was common for the age. Caravaggio’s treatment is remarkable for the realism of his Cupid – where other depictions, such as a contemporary \"Sleeping Cupid\" by Battistello Caracciolo, show an idealised, almost generic, beautiful boy, Caravaggio’s Cupid is highly individual, charming but not at all beautiful, all crooked teeth and crooked grin: one feels that one would recognise him in the street. The shock of the Caravaggio, quite apart from the dramatic chiaroscuro lighting and the photographic clarity, is the mingling of the allegorical and the real, this sense it gives of a child who is having a thoroughly good time dressing up in stage-prop wings with a bunch of arrows and having his picture painted. Nevertheless, despite the clear indications of Caravaggio’s practice of painting direct from a live model, there is an undeniable resemblance to the pose of Michelangelo's \"Victory\" now in the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence, and it is likely the artist had this in mind.\n\nThe painter Orazio Gentileschi lent Caravaggio the wings as props to be used in the painting, and this allows fairly precise dating of 1602–3. It was an immediate success in the circles of Rome’s intellectual and cultural elite. A poet immediately wrote three madrigals about it, and another wrote a Latin epigram in which it was first coupled with the Virgilian phrase \"Omnia Vincit Amor\", although this did not become its title until the critic Giovanni Pietro Bellori wrote his life of Caravaggio in 1672. \n\nInevitably, much scholarly and non-scholarly ink has been spilled over the alleged eroticism of the painting. Yet the homoerotic content was perhaps not so apparent to Giustiniani’s generation as it has become today. Naked boys could be seen on any riverbank or seashore, and the eroticisation of children is very much a cultural artefact of the present-day rather than Caravaggio's. The story that the Marchese kept \"Amor\" hidden behind a curtain relates to his reported wish that it should be kept as a final \"pièce de résistance\" for visitors, to be seen only when the rest of the collection had been viewed – in other words, the curtain was to reveal the painting, not to hide it. (According to the historian Joachim von Sandrart, who catalogued the Giustiniani collection in the 1630s, the curtain was only installed at his urging at that time). The challenge is to see the \"Amor Vincit\" through 17th century eyes.\n\nIn 1602, shortly after \"Amor Vincit\" was completed, Cardinal Benedetto Giustiniani, Vincenzo’s brother and collaborator in the creation of the Giustiniani collection of contemporary art, commissioned a painting from the noted artist Giovanni Baglione. Baglione’s \"Divine and Profane Love\" showed Divine Love separating a juvenile Cupid on the ground in the lower right corner (profane love) from a Lucifer in the left corner. Its style was thoroughly derivative of Caravaggio (who had recently emerged as a rival for Church commissions) and a clear challenge to the recent \"Amor\", and the younger painter bitterly protested at what he saw as the plagiarism. Taunted by one of Caravaggio’s friends, Baglione responded with a second version, in which the devil was given Caravaggio’s face. Thus began a long and vicious quarrel which was to have unforeseeable ramifications for Caravaggio decades after his death when the unforgiving Baglione became his first biographer.\n\nSandrart described \"Amor\" as \"A life size Cupid after a boy of about twelve...[who] has large brown eagle's wings, drawn so correctly and with such strong colouring, clarity and relief that it all comes to life.\". Richard Symonds, an English visitor to Rome about 1649/51, recorded the Cupid as being \"ye body and face of his (Caravaggio's) owne boy or servant thait (sic) laid with him\". The Italian art historian Giani Pappi has put forward the theory that this Cecco may be identical with Cecco del Caravaggio ('Caravaggio’s Cecco'), a notable Italian follower of Caravaggio who emerged in the decade after the master’s death. While this remains controversial, there is more widespread support for Pappi's further proposal that Cecco del Caravaggio should be identified as an artist known as Francesco Boneri. Cecco Boneri, if this is his name, appears in many of Caravaggio's paintings, as the juvenile angel supporting Christ in \"The Conversion of Saint Paul\", (1600–1601) possibly as the angel offering a martyr's palm to the saint in \"The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew\" (1599–1600) (although seen only as the top of a curly head of hair), as the young Isaac about to have his throat cut in \"The Sacrifice of Isaac\" (1603), as an adolescent David in \"David with the Head of Goliath (Caravaggio, Rome)\" (ca. 1610 – the head is Caravaggio's), and as the John the Baptist now in the Capitoline gallery in Rome.\n\nThe picture remained in the Giustiniani collection until 1812, when it was purchased by the art dealer Féréol Bonnemaison, and sold to Frederick William III of Prussia in 1815 for the Berlin Museums.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23304930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23304930", "title": "Cath Finntrágha", "text": "Cath Finntrágha\n\nCath Finntrágha (The Battle of Ventry) is an Early Modern Irish prose narrative of the Finn Cycle. It dates probably to the 15th century in its current form, but apparently relied on older material. It concerns the deeds of the warrior-hero Finn mac Cumaill and his \"fianna\" as they defend Ireland against a foreign invasion led by the world-king Dáire Donn.\n\nDáire (or Dáiri) Donn, called \"king of the great world\" and ostensibly the most powerful ruler in Europe, intends to invade Ireland. Apart from seeking to gratify a more general ambition to conquer territory, he has a pretext and motif which are directed at Finn mac Cumaill in person. First of all, Dáire seeks retribution for the fact that Finn has eloped with the wife and daughter of Bolcán (Vulcan), King of France, when in the mercenary service of the latter. Second, Dáire's sense of honour and pride is ignited by stories about Finn's successes. He musters a large body of forces from all across Europe and invades Ireland at \"Finntraighe\" (lit. 'fair strand'), the shore of Ventry (County Kerry), near Dingle. A mighty and protracted battle ensues. Finn's son Oisín faces Bolcán in combat, who much like Suibne Geilt, goes insane and flies off, ultimately landing at Glenn Bolcáin. The young son of the King of Ulster arrives with a troop of boys to rally to Finn's support but is killed. It is only when the Tuatha Dé Danann are called in that the Irish become victorious. When Finn slays Dáire Donn and the Greek amazon Ógarmach, the invaders admit defeat and take flight.\n\nThe text in its present form was probably written in the 15th century and is represented by two vellum manuscripts: (1) Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Rawlinson B. 487, 1–11, and (2) Dublin, Royal Irish Academy, MS 29 (\"olim\" 23 L 24), 328–337, 355–361. In a note to Rawlinson B. 487, the scribe Finnlaech Ó Cathasaigh of Tirawley (County Mayo) declares to have composed the tale for Sadbh Ní Mháille (daughter of Tadg Ó Maille), wife of Richard MacWilliam Bourke (d. 1479).\n\nEarlier allusions to Finn's battle at Ventry suggest that one or several versions of the story were current as early as the 12th century. The event is first referred to in a love-story of the \"Acallam na Senórach\", in which Finn sets out to meet the enemy in battle, but interrupts the journey to act as a match-maker for Cáel and Créde. During the seventeen days of the battle, the couple offer assistance to Finn, but on the last day, Cáel drowns at sea in pursuit of an opponent and Créde dies of grief. Yet the 15th-century \"Cath Finntrágha\" appears to offer a thoroughly revised tale, which incorporates miscellaneous narrative material from the Finn Cycle, the Ulster Cycle and the Mythological Cycle. It has been argued that much of its framework was suggested by the earlier tale \"Cath Trága Rudraigi\" (\"The Battle of Dundrum Bay\"), in which Norsemen forces invade Ireland and do battle at Dundrum Bay (County Down).\n\nJohn O'Donovan provides a number of interesting insights into the Battle of Ventry in his Ordnance Survey letters of 1841. He noted several burial carns near Cantraw, presumed evidence of a great slaughter, along with local claims of finds of many bones and skulls at the east end of the strand. He also noted a boggy area known for the slaughter of the mighty men, \"Guin na dTreanfhear\".\n\n\n\nThe Novel 'Storm Shield' by Kenneth C. Flint is based on the characters and events of the Battle of Ventry.\n\n"}

She is the youngest of King Lear's three daughters, and his favourite. After her elderly father offers her the opportunity to profess her love to him in return for one third of the land in his kingdom, she refuses and is banished for the majority of the play.\n\nShakespeare had numerous resources to consult while writing \"King Lear\". The oldest source in print was Geoffrey of Monmouth's \"The History of the Kings of Britain\", c.1136. This is the earliest written record of Cordelia. Here she is depicted as Queen Cordelia.\n\nIn Shakespeare's \"King Lear\", Cordelia is briefly on stage during Act 1, scene 1. Her father Lear exiles her as a response to her honesty when he asks for professions of love from his three daughters to determine how to divide the lands of his kingdom between them. Cordelia's sisters, Goneril and Regan, give deceitfully-lavish speeches professing their love, flattering his vanity. Cordelia, seeing right through her sisters' feigned professions of love, refuses to do the same. Lear deems her answer (\"Love, and be silent\" 1.1.62) as too simple. Lear asks her, \"What can you say to draw / A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.\" (1.1.84-5). Cordelia replies, \"Nothing, my lord.\" (1.1.86). She continues, \"Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave / My heart into my mouth. I love your majesty / According to my bond; no more nor less.\" (1.1 90-2). Unlike her father and sisters, Cordelia is able to differentiate love from property. Feeling outraged and humiliated that Cordelia will not publicly lavish love on him, Lear banishes Cordelia from the kingdom. She does not return until Act 4, scene 4.\n\nCordelia was always Lear’s favourite daughter. After Lear is rejected by Cordelia's wicked sisters, Goneril and Regan, he goes mad. Cordelia returns at the end of the play with the intentions of helping Lear, ultimately reversing her role as daughter to that of mother. But when she arrives, Lear can not even recognize her in his state of madness. Nevertheless, she forgives him for banishing her. By the time Lear finally regains his reason and realizes who Cordelia is, they have little time to talk and reconcile. Edmund arrives and sends them both to prison, where Cordelia is ultimately hanged. In Nahum Tate's \"happy-ending\" revision \"The History of King Lear\" (1681), which replaced Shakespeare's original version on stage for decades, Cordelia marries Edgar and becomes ruler of the kingdom.\n\nWhen Lear offers his kingdom to his three daughters, a role reversal occurs in which the daughters become mother figures for Lear. By dividing his kingdom between his daughters, Lear gives them the power to dictate his own future, just as a father has control over the future of his children. Because Cordelia is the daughter he loves most, Lear expects her to care for him as he hands over his power to his children and advances into old age, much like how a mother cares for her baby.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "48081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48081", "title": "Essentialism", "text": "Essentialism\n\nEssentialism is the view that every entity has a set of attributes that are necessary to its identity and function. In early Western thought Plato's idealism held that all things have such an \"essence\"—an \"idea\" or \"form\". In \"Categories\", Aristotle similarly proposed that all objects have a substance that, as George Lakoff put it \"make the thing what it is, and without which it would be not \"that\" kind of thing\". The contrary view—non-essentialism—denies the need to posit such an \"essence'\".\n\nEssentialism has been controversial from its beginning. Plato, in the \"Parmenides Dialogue\", depicts Socrates questioning the notion, suggesting that if we accept the idea that every beautiful thing or just action partakes of an essence to be beautiful or just, we must also accept the \"existence of separate essences for hair, mud, and dirt\" . In biology and other natural sciences, essentialism provided the rationale for taxonomy at least until the time of Charles Darwin; the role and importance of essentialism in biology is still a matter of debate.\nIn gender studies the essentialist idea that men and women are fundamentally different continues to be a matter of contention.\n\nAn \"essence\" characterizes a substance or a form, in the sense of the forms and ideas in Platonic idealism. It is permanent, unalterable, and eternal, is and present in every possible world. Classical humanism has an essentialist conception of the human, in its endorsement of the notion of an eternal and unchangeable human nature. This has been criticized by Kierkegaard, Marx, Heidegger, Sartre, and many other existential and materialist thinkers.\n\nIn Plato's philosophy (in particular, the \"Timaeus\" and the \"Philebus\"), things were said to come into being by the action of a demiurge who works to form chaos into ordered entities. Many definitions of \"essence\" hark back to the ancient Greek hylomorphic understanding of the formation of the things. According to that account, the structure and real existence of any thing can be understood by analogy to an artefact produced by a craftsperson. The craftsperson requires \"hyle\" (timber or wood) and a model, plan or idea in her own mind, according to which the wood is worked to give it the indicated contour or form (\"morphe\"). Aristotle was the first to use the terms \"hyle\" and \"morphe\". According to his explanation, all entities have two aspects: \"matter\" and \"form\". It is the particular form imposed that gives some matter its identity—its quiddity or \"whatness\" (i.e., its \"what it is\").\n\nPlato was one of the first essentialists, postulating the concept of ideal forms—an abstract entity of which individual objects are mere facsimiles. To give an example: the ideal form of a circle is a perfect circle, something that is physically impossible to make manifest; yet the circles we draw and observe clearly have some \"idea\" in common—the ideal form. Plato proposed that these ideas are eternal and vastly superior to their manifestations, and that we understand these manifestations in the material world by comparing and relating them to their respective ideal form. Plato's forms are regarded as patriarchs to essentialist dogma simply because they are a case of what is intrinsic and a-contextual of objects—the abstract properties that makes them what they are. (For more on forms, read Plato's parable of the cave.)\n\nKarl Popper splits the ambiguous term \"realism\" into \"essentialism\" and \"realism\". He uses \"essentialism\" whenever he means the opposite of nominalism, and \"realism\" only as opposed to idealism. Popper himself is a realist as opposed to an idealist, but a methodological nominalist as opposed to an essentialist. For example, statements like \"a puppy is a young dog\" should be read from right to left, as an answer to \"What shall we call a young dog\"; never from left to right as an answer to \"What is a puppy?\"\n\nEssentialism, in its broadest sense, is any philosophy that acknowledges the primacy of \"essence\". Unlike existentialism, which posits \"being\" as the fundamental reality, the essentialist ontology must be approached from a metaphysical perspective. Empirical knowledge is developed from experience of a relational universe whose components and attributes are defined and measured in terms of intellectually constructed laws. Thus, for the scientist, reality is explored as an evolutionary system of diverse entities, the order of which is determined by the principle of causality.\n\nPlato believed that the universe was perfect and that its observed imperfections came from man's limited perception of it. For Plato, there were two realities: the \"essential\" or ideal and the \"perceived\". Aristotle (384–322 B.C.) applied the term \"essence\" to that which things in a category have in common and without which they cannot be members of that category (for example, \"rationality\" is the essence of man; without rationality a creature cannot be a man). In his critique of Aristotle's philosophy, Bertrand Russell said that his concept of essence transferred to metaphysics what was only a verbal convenience and that it confused the properties of language with the properties of the world. In fact, a thing's \"essence\" consisted in those defining properties without which we could not use the \"name\" for it. Although the concept of essence was \"hopelessly muddled\" it became part of every philosophy until modern times.\n\nThe Egyptian-born philosopher Plotinus (204–270 CE) brought idealism to the Roman Empire as Neoplatonism, and with it the concept that not only do all existents emanate from a \"primary essence\" but that the mind plays an active role in shaping or ordering the objects of perception, rather than passively receiving empirical data.\n\nDespite the metaphysical basis for the term, academics in science, aesthetics, heuristics, psychology, and gender-based sociological studies have advanced their causes under the banner of essentialism. Possibly the clearest definition for this philosophy was offered by gay/lesbian rights advocate Diana Fuss, who wrote: \"Essentialism is most commonly understood as a belief in the real, true essence of things, the invariable and fixed properties which define the 'whatness' of a given entity.\" Metaphysical essentialism stands diametrically opposed to existential realism in that finite existence is only differentiated appearance, whereas \"ultimate reality\" is held to be absolute essence.\n\nAmong contemporary essentialists, what all existing things have in common is \"the power to exist\", which defines their \"uncreated\" Essence.\n\nIn 2010, an article by Gerald B. Folland in the \"Notices of the American Mathematical Society\" stated, \"It is a truth universally acknowledged that almost all mathematicians are Platonists, at least when they are actually doing mathematics …\" This refers to their implicit embrace of essentialism, which he finds revealed in mathematicians peculiar use of language. Whereas physicists define Lie algebra as a rule they can apply to facts, mathematicians define it as an essence of a structure, independent of any circumstance.\n\nThere is a difference between metaphysical essentialism (see above) and psychological essentialism, the latter referring not to an actual claim about the world but a claim about a way of representing entities in cognitions (Medin, 1989). Influential in this area is Susan Gelman, who has outlined many domains in which children and adults construe classes of entities, particularly biological entities, in essentialist terms—i.e., as if they had an immutable underlying essence which can be used to predict unobserved similarities between members of that class. (Toosi & Ambady, 2011). This causal relationship is unidirectional; an observable feature of an entity does not define the underlying essence (Dar-Nimrod & Heine, 2011).\n\nEssentialism has emerged as an important concept in psychology, particularly developmental psychology. Gelman and Kremer (1991) studied the extent to which children from 4–7 years old demonstrate essentialism. Children were able to identify the cause of behaviour in living and non-living objects. Children understood that underlying essences predicted observable behaviours. Participants could correctly describe living objects' behaviour as self-perpetuated and non-living objects as a result of an adult influencing the object's actions. This is a biological way of representing essential features in cognitions. Understanding the underlying causal mechanism for behaviour suggests essentialist thinking (Rangel and Keller, 2011).\nYounger children were unable to identify causal mechanisms of behaviour whereas older children were able to. This suggests that essentialism is rooted in cognitive development. It can be argued that there is a shift in the way that children represent entities, from not understanding the causal mechanism of the underlying essence to showing sufficient understanding (Demoulin, Leyens & Yzerbyt, 2006).\n\nThere are four key criteria which constitute essentialist thinking. The first facet is the aforementioned individual causal mechanisms (del Rio & Strasser, 2011). The second is innate potential: the assumption that an object will fulfill its predetermined course of development (Kanovsky, 2007). According to this criterion, essences predict developments in entities that will occur throughout its lifespan. The third is immutability (Holtz & Wagner, 2009). Despite altering the superficial appearance of an object it does not remove its essence. Observable changes in features of an entity are not salient enough to alter its essential characteristics. The fourth is inductive potential (Birnbaum, Deeb, Segall, Ben-Aliyahu & Diesendruck, 2010). This suggests that entities may share common features but are essentially different. However similar two beings may be, their characteristics will be at most analogous, differing most importantly in essences.\n\nThe implications of psychological essentialism are numerous. Prejudiced individuals have been found to endorse exceptionally essential ways of thinking, suggesting that essentialism may perpetuate exclusion among social groups (Morton, Hornsey & Postmes, 2009). This may be due to an over-extension of an essential-biological mode of thinking stemming from cognitive development. Paul Bloom of Yale University has stated that \"one of the most exciting ideas in cognitive science is the theory that people have a default assumption that things, people and events have invisible essences that make them what they are. Experimental psychologists have argued that essentialism underlies our understanding of the physical and social worlds, and developmental and cross-cultural psychologists have proposed that it is instinctive and universal. We are natural-born essentialists.\" Scholars suggest that the categorical nature of essentialist thinking predicts the use of stereotypes and can be targeted in the application of stereotype prevention (Bastian & Haslam, 2006).\n\nClassical essentialists claim that some things are wrong in an absolute sense. For example murder breaks a universal, objective and natural moral law and not merely an advantageous, socially or ethically constructed one.\n\nMany modern essentialists claim that right and wrong are moral boundaries that are individually constructed; in other words, things that are ethically right or wrong are actions that the individual deems to be beneficial or harmful, respectively.\n\nOne possibility is that before evolution was developed as a scientific theory, there existed an essentialist view of biology that posited all species to be unchanging throughout time. The historian Mary P. Winsor has argued that biologists such as Louis Agassiz in the 19th century believed that taxa such as species and genus were fixed, reflecting the mind of the creator. Some religious opponents of evolution continue to maintain this view of biology.\n\nRecent work by historians of systematic biology has, however, cast doubt upon this view of pre-Darwinian thinkers. Winsor, Ron Amundson and Staffan Müller-Wille have each argued that in fact the usual suspects (such as Linnaeus and the Ideal Morphologists) were very far from being essentialists, and it appears that the so-called \"essentialism story\" (or \"myth\") in biology is a result of conflating the views expressed by philosophers from Aristotle onwards through to John Stuart Mill and William Whewell in the immediately pre-Darwinian period, using biological examples, with the use of terms in biology like species.\n\nIn feminist theory and gender studies, gender essentialism is the attribution of a fixed essence to women. Women's essence is assumed to be universal and is generally identified with those characteristics viewed as being specifically feminine. These ideas of femininity are usually biologized and are often preoccupied with psychological characteristics, such as nurturance, empathy, support, and non-competitiveness, etc. Feminist theorist Elizabeth Grosz states in her 1995 publication \"Space, time and perversion: essays on the politics of bodies\" that essentialism \"entails the belief that those characteristics defined as women's essence are shared in common by all women at all times. It implies a limit of the variations and possibilities of change—it is not possible for a subject to act in a manner contrary to her essence. Her essence underlies all the apparent variations differentiating women from each other. Essentialism thus refers to the existence of fixed characteristic, given attributes, and ahistorical functions that limit the possibilities of change and thus of social reorganization.\"\n\nGender essentialism is pervasive in popular culture, as illustrated by the #1 \"New York Times\" best seller \"Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus\", but this essentialism is routinely critiqued in introductory women studies textbooks such as \"Women: Images & Realities\".\n\nStarting in the 1980s, some feminist writers have put forward essentialist theories about gender and science. Evelyn Fox Keller, Sandra Harding,\n\nEssentialism in history as a field of study entails discerning and listing essential cultural characteristics of a particular nation or culture, in the belief that a people or culture can be understood in this way. Sometimes such essentialism leads to claims of a praiseworthy national or cultural identity, or to its opposite, the condemnation of a culture based on presumed essential characteristics. Herodotus, for example, claims that Egyptian culture is essentially feminized and possesses a \"softness\" which has made Egypt easy to conquer. To what extent Herodotus was an essentialist is a matter of debate; he is also credited with not essentializing the concept of the Athenian identity, or differences between the Greeks and the Persians that are the subject of his \"Histories\".\n\nEssentialism had been operative in colonialism as well as in critiques of colonialism.\n\nPost-colonial theorists such as Edward Said insisted that essentialism was the \"defining mode\" of \"Western\" historiography and ethnography until the nineteenth century and even after, according to Touraj Atabaki, manifesting itself in the historiography of the Middle East and Central Asia as Eurocentrism, over-generalization, and reductionism.\n\nMost historians reject essentialism because it \"dehistoricizes the process of social and cultural changes\" and tends to see non-Western societies as historically unchanging; in India this led to the anti-essentialist (even anti-historiographical) school of Subaltern Studies.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2200993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2200993", "title": "For Keeps (film)", "text": "For Keeps (film)\n\nFor Keeps is a 1988 American coming of age comedy drama film starring Molly Ringwald and Randall Batinkoff as Darcy and Stan, two high school seniors in love. Complications ensue when Darcy becomes pregnant just before graduation and decides to keep her baby. This movie is noted for being Ringwald's final \"teen\" movie, and is cited as one of her most mature performances, particularly in a scene where Darcy is suffering from postpartum depression after the birth of her child.\n\nIn Kenosha, Wisconsin, Darcy, editor at her high school paper, and her steady boyfriend Stan are in their final year of high school and already have been accepted at good colleges; before Darcy goes to the University of Wisconsin to study journalism, she will go on a trip to Paris with her mother for her graduation present, while Stan will go to Caltech to study architecture. With the help of Darcy's best friend Lila, Darcy and Stan spend a weekend together, where they sleep together, and Darcy becomes pregnant. They announce the news at Thanksgiving, and neither Darcy's mother Donna, who was abandoned by her husband and brought up Darcy alone, nor Stan's Catholic parents are very supportive. Respectively, they urge the young couple to have an abortion or give up the baby for adoption. Darcy plans to have an abortion, but does not go through with it, much to Stan's relief.\n\nAt Christmas, the kids announce their plans to keep the baby, causing a break between them and their parents. They rent a decrepit apartment and get married to the cheers of their friends, despite the fact that without parental consent the marriage is not legal. At the urging of her high school guidance counselor, who explains that other girls will want to emulate her and become teenaged mothers themselves, Darcy drops out of high school but works toward her GED. Prom is interrupted by Darcy's water breaking; although baby Thea (short for Theodosia) is healthy, Darcy suffers from post-partum depression, unable to even hold her daughter, and Stan struggles to pay the bills on a part-time job salary. Only when Darcy hears an intruder (who turns out to be Stan's father) and picks up her baby protectively, does she break from her depression.\n\nWithout telling Darcy, Stan sacrifices his Caltech scholarship because there is no married housing at the school for undergraduates. Although Stan takes a second, dead-end job, the bills pile up, and the couple finally moves in with Donna, which alienates Stan and Darcy, and causes Stan to start drinking heavily. Local neighborhood girl Michaela informs Darcy of the scholarship deception so she enlists Stan's best friend Chris in a plan to ensure he take the scholarship and go to college after all. The plan entails throwing out Stan and annulling the marriage. Stan reconciles with his parents, but is heartbroken over the split with Darcy, who does not change her mind but becomes visibly angrily at her mother's cold attitude.\n\nAt Darcy's night school graduation, Stan arrives to inform Darcy that he has applied for scholarships to the University of Wisconsin–Madison for them both. Darcy lets slip her role in the Caltech deception with Chris, and Stan chases after her as she drives away. Darcy finally tells Donna that Stan is a good man, that she loves him and Donna can either embrace them as an entire family or watch them live their lives without her. Donna finally gets over her past and says she loves and supports Darcy fully. They reconcile, go forward on their plans to attend college in Madison in the fall, and remark Thea will have a very early curfew when she is a teenager. Stan says ten p.m. and Darcy says eleven p.m. Then they say if she is really in love her curfew will be eight p.m.\n\n\nThe film is set in Kenosha, Wisconsin and was partially filmed there. Primary location work took place in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.\n\nThe film had a number of titles while in production, possibilities including \"Maybe, Baby\" (by which it is known in some overseas territories) and \"For Keeps?\", before settling on the final question mark-less version.\n\nThe promising career of John Zarchen, thought to be on the verge of breakout in the supporting role of Stan's best friend, Chris, literally hit a wall during the shooting, as Zarchen suffered a life-threatening head injury while driving in Hollywood, allegedly under the influence of alcohol. He survived a brief period of being comatose, and actually returned to the film, although director John Avildsen, due to his medical absence and disgusted with the actor's disregard for the opportunity and the production, greatly cut down his role. This movie also marks the film debut of Pauly Shore, who appears in a small role as another friend of Stan.\n\nThe musical score features a lullaby-like version of the song \"Be My Baby\", sung by composer Ellie Greenwich.\n\nActor Adam Silbar was originally cast in the lead role of Stan but, for unknown reasons, the role was later re-cast with Randall Batinkoff just weeks before the first day of production. Author and casting director Paul G. Bens, Jr., then an actor, was one of the two finalists to replace Silbar. The role ultimately went to Batinkoff.\n\nRotten Tomatoes aggregate score gave the film an 18% rotten rating based on 11 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film a positive review saying, \"The movies of Molly Ringwald have been responsible for a revolution in the way Hollywood regards teenagers. Before Ringwald (and her mentor, John Hughes) there were only horny teenagers, dead teenagers, teenage vampires and psychotic crackups. Now teenage movies are working their way through some of the aspects of the normal life of American teenagers, and in \"For Keeps,\" Ringwald plays a popular high school senior who gets pregnant and gets married.\"\n\nJanet Maslin of New York Times said, \"Most of \"For Keeps\" is entirely predictable, but that should do little to diminish its interest for audiences of high-school age. Here again, Miss Ringwald is the very model of teen-age verisimilitude, and she's most impressive in making even the most hackneyed situations seem real. In fact, she's so good she's almost a problem. Mr. Batinkoff, while pleasant, is no real match for her, and the glowering parents who make their kids' lives miserable for a time are no real threat. There is the feeling that Miss Ringwald's Darcy can triumph over anything. But perhaps that's just what Mr. Avildsen had in mind.\"\n\nJudge Brian Pope gave a positive review saying, \"Pretty but approachable, smart but funny, cool but sweet, Ringwald represented everything most high-school girls wanted to be: the girl next door who always got the guy without compromising her values. Small wonder she is still regarded as an icon of '80s teen cinema. It wasn't until Ringwald began dipping her toes into slightly more adult roles that she lost her footing. Take 'For Keeps', for instance. This movie dared to suggest that even a popular honors student is capable of making wrong decisions that result in life-changing consequences. More crucially, Ringwald suggested to her fans that the qualities they found so endearing in her aren't always adequate substitutes for natural maturity. Perhaps that was a bitter pill for her fans to swallow, but it's not such a bad message, and, more than 15 years after its release, 'For Keeps' isn't such a bad movie.\"\n\nDavid Nusair gave a more negative review saying, \"For Keeps takes a potentially intriguing subject (two teenagers attempting to start their lives together) and piles on cliche after cliche, until it's about as compelling as an afterschool special.\"\n\nIn January 1988, the film debuted at #4 at the box office (behind \"Good Morning, Vietnam\", \"Three Men and a Baby\", and \"Moonstruck\"). Grossing $17,514,553 domestically, the film is a box office success given its estimated budget of $10 million.\n\nOn March 23, 2004 the film was released on DVD.\n\n"}

Galley proofs may be uncut and unbound, or in some cases electronically transmitted. They are created for proofreading and copyediting purposes, but may also be used for promotional and review purposes.\n\nProof, in the typographical sense, is a term that dates from c. 1600. The primary goal of proofing is to create a tool for verification that the job is accurate. All needed or suggested changes are physically marked on paper proofs or electronically marked on electronic proofs by the author, editor, and proofreaders. The compositor, typesetter, or printer receives the edited copies, corrects and re-arranges the type or the pagination, and arranges for the press workers to print the final or published copies.\n\nGalley proofs or galleys are so named because in the days of hand-set letterpress printing in the 1650s, the printer would set the page into galleys, namely the metal trays into which type was laid and tightened into place. A small proof press would then be used to print a limited number of copies for proofreading. Galley proofs are thus, historically speaking, galleys printed on a proof press. \n\nFrom the printer's point of view, the galley proof, as it originated during the era of hand-set physical type, had two primary purposes, those being to check that the compositor had set the copy accurately (because sometimes individual pieces of type did get put in the wrong case after use) and that the type was free of defects (because type metal is comparatively soft, so type can get damaged). \n\nOnce a defect-free galley proof was produced, the publishing house requested a number of galley proofs to be run off for distribution to editors and authors for a final reading and corrections to the text before the type was fixed in the chase for printing.\n\nAn uncorrected proof is a proof version (on paper or in digital form) which is yet to receive final author and publisher approval. The term may also appear on the covers of advance reading copies; see below.\n\nThese days, because much typesetting and pre-press work is conducted digitally and transmitted electronically, the term uncorrected proof is more common than the older term galley proof, which refers exclusively to a paper proofing system. However, if a paper print-out of an uncorrected proof is made on a desk-top printer or copy machine and used as a paper proof for authorial or editorial mark-up, it approximates a galley proof, and it may be referred to as a galley. \nPreliminary electronic proof versions are also sometimes called digital proofs, pdf proofs, and pre-fascicle proofs, the last because they are viewed as single pages, not as they will look when gathered into fascicles or signatures for the press.\n\nProofs created by the printer for approval by the publisher before going to press are called final proofs. At this stage in production, all mistakes are supposed to have been corrected and the pages are set up in imposition for folding and cutting on the press. To correct a mistake at this stage entails an extra cost per page, so authors are discouraged from making many changes to final proofs, while last-minute corrections by the in-house publishing staff may be accepted. \n\nIn the final proof stage, page layouts are examined closely. Additionally, because final page proofs contain the final pagination, if an index was not compiled at an earlier stage in production, this pagination facilitates compiling a book's index and correcting its table of contents.\n\nHistorically, some publishers have used paper galley proofs as advance copies or advance reading copies (ARCs) or as pre-publication publicity proofs. These are provided to reviewers, magazines, and libraries in advance of final publication. These galleys are not sent out for correction, but to ensure timely reviews of newly published works. The list of recipients designated by the publisher limits the number of copies to only what is required, making advance copies a form of print-on-demand (POD) publication. \n\nPre-publication publicity proofs are normally gathered and bound in paper, but in the case of books with four-color printed illustrations, publicity proofs may be lacking illustrations or have them in black and white only. They may be marked or stamped on the cover \"uncorrected proof,\" but the recipient is not expected to proofread them, merely to overlook any minor errors of typesetting. \n\nGalley proofs in electronic form are rarely used as advance reading copies due to the possibility of a recipient editing the proof and issuing it as their own. However, trusted colleagues are occasionally offered electronic advance reading copies, especially if the publisher wishes to quickly typeset a page or two of \"advance praise\" notices within the book itself. \n\n"}

In fact, it owes so much to the early graffiti movement, in the United States guerrilla art is still referred to as ‘post-graffiti art’.\nGuerrilla art differs from other art forms in it has no external boundary between the image and the environment. While a traditional painting can be moved from one gallery to another without the meaning or the artistic credibility of the piece being affected, street art is environmental, the surface to which it is applied to being as fundamental to the piece's meaning as that which is applied. Without the dynamics of modern life, guerrilla art is reduced to ‘art for arts sake’ and would be defined by \"what it is\" as opposed to \"what it does\".\n\nThe production of guerrilla art is focused on cause and effect, not the material piece itself. It aims to produce an effect within the minds of those people who live within the environment being altered. It does not necessarily aim to produce meaningful art in itself.\n\nGuerrilla artists increasingly seem to be moving towards a philosophy of painting a continuous work of art, adding to it over time as less developed elements of the piece are erased by graffiti cleaning efforts or in the battle for space. Art on canvas is not guerrilla art. Although many guerrilla artists regularly produce ‘trapped art’, they do not generally consider it to be the same thing. This has manifested itself in a wave of new canvas styles that have a guerrilla art style, but are more comprehensive and finished. Few traditional artists would create artwork intentionally meaning for it to be mass produced with little fidelity and put up with wheat paste. Many guerrilla artists hijack major branding for their own publicity and identity, often at odds with the brand itself. This can be seen with D*Face's hijacking of the Walt Disney signature.\n\nIt's not a movement that attempts to support or to oppose brand conditioning. It is the general public's artistic response to it.\n\n\nIn 1978 in downtown Wellington, New Zealand artist Barry Thomas, in collaboration with Chris Lipscombe, Hugh Walton and others, planted 180 cabbages \"on the demolished Duke of Edinburgh/Roxy Theatre site in the centre of Wellington. This cabbage patch, planted in such a way as to spell the word CABBAGE immediately captured the imagination of both the media and the public and engendered a flurry of other activities on the site, culminating in a week-long festival... when the cabbages were ceremonially harvested.\" While a work of conceptual sculpture, this intervention is also an early example of Guerrilla art and guerilla gardening in New Zealand. Thomas' work remained for six months, \"astonishingly unvandalised, as a living, breathing sculpture in the heart of the city.\" Christina Barton writes in the following months, \"it captured the hearts and minds of Wellingtonians, who followed the growth of the cabbages, adding their own embellishments to the site, and contributed to the week of festivities (with poetry readings, performances, and the distribution of free coleslaw) that celebrated their harvest\", describing the work as \"a provocation to the local council and the city's developers\". Thomas' documentation of the project was recently purchased by New Zealand's national gallery Te Papa, who described the work as an \"important moment in New Zealand’s art and social history\" with links to the \"Occupy movement, urban farming and guerrilla gardening\".\n\nArtistic movements are responsive. This movement is a response to the ever-increasing power and importance of the brand in everyday life. Developed, inner-city environments are where both branding and guerrilla art flourish. This is not coincidental.\n\nThe most important development in the street art movement and the reason for its 'guerrilla' tag is the adoption of guerrilla marketing techniques over traditional artistic methods. The use of guerrilla marketing methods to create ‘artistic publicity’ has seen the evolution away from artists as creative individuals and towards artists as brands.\n\nIt is this branding and the profound effect it has upon the minds of the general public that drives the guerrilla art movement.\n\n\n"}

In music, such an outside performer is often referred to as a guest artist. In performance art, the terms guest role or guest star are also common, the latter term specifically indicating the guest appearance of a celebrity. The latter is often also credited as special guest star or special musical guest star by some production companies. \n\nIn pop music, guest appearances are often described with the words featuring, with, or and. It is abbreviated in credit lists as feat., ft., f/, or f.. \n\nIn a television series, a guest star is an actor who appears in one or a few episodes (sometimes an entire story arc). \n\nIn radio and television shows, a guest star is a guest on the show who is a celebrity.\n\nGuest appearances have been known in theatre, ballet, and classical music for centuries, with guests both from the home country and from abroad. The advent of air transport has made this practice much more practical and global.\n\nIn classical music, guest orchestra conductors are a common practice.\n\nGuest artists should not be confused with touring groups, troupes, orchestra, or even individual artists, although the distinction may be blurred. In the case of touring, their act is independent in itself, while the guest takes part in the act of the resident staff.\n\nThe duration of involvement of a guest artist may vary, from separate short-term acts with fees per concert to fixed temporary contracts for several seasons.\n\nIn the early days of the pop music industry the bands were relatively stable units, and while guests were not uncommon, they were seldom given credits on album covers. For example, Eric Clapton was not credited in print for his guitar performance in the release of \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" of the Beatles. Still the term \"featuring\" was used as early as in the July 1954 UK Singles Chart by \"The Four Aces featuring Al Alberts\" with \"Three Coins In The Fountain\" at 5th place.\nGradually guest appearances have become a fully credited staple of music industry. The custom of guest appearance has become especially prominent in rap music, and this influenced rock musicians as well.\n\nTo have a guest star on a record, the production coordinator must obtain permission from the record label of the guest and make sure that proper credits are delivered to the host record label to be printed on the album cover, often in the form \"\"Artist name\", courtesy of \"Record Label name.\"\" The permission is not always granted and sometimes negotiations may take a long time.\n\nA common reason for guest appearances is to draw attention to an act by including a celebrity into it. And vice versa, in the fashion-driven environment of show industry, older stars keep themselves in the limelight by associating themselves with emerging stars.\n\nIn rap, mutual and multiple guest starring was recognized as a way to diversify the performance.\n\nIn theatre and ballet, guest appearances diversify actors' repertory and experience under different choreographers, and give more acting opportunities. Even for established stars prestigious overseas engagements increase their home status. Conversely, a guest star benefits the receiving troupe, bringing new inspiration and technique. Audience would welcome diversity, and theatrical business benefits as well: theatre connoisseurs will come to see the same piece with a new star.\n\nCommercialization of guests policy may also have negative consequences. Local theatres may limit the growth opportunities for their performers in favor of guests. Sometimes rehearsal times are inadequate to fully integrate the home and guest styles. Touring increases physical load on an actor. It is also associated with multiple stress factors: from jet lags to close calls due to unanticipated travel delays.\n\nWith a television series, the appearance of a special guest star could mark the moment when a series \"jumps the shark\"; that is, a doomed attempt to reverse a decline in popularity.\n\n"}

{"id": "3563310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3563310", "title": "Indexed color", "text": "Indexed color\n\nIn computing, indexed color is a technique to manage digital images' colors in a limited fashion, in order to save computer memory and file storage, while speeding up display refresh and file transfers. It is a form of vector quantization compression.\n\nWhen an image is encoded in this way, color information is not directly carried by the image pixel data, but is stored in a separate piece of data called a palette: an array of color elements. Every element in the array represents a color, indexed by its position within the array. The individual entries are sometimes known as color registers. The image pixels do not contain the full specification of its color, but only its index in the \"palette\". This technique is sometimes referred as pseudocolor or indirect color, as colors are addressed indirectly.\n\nPerhaps the first device that supported palette colors was a random-access frame buffer, described in 1975 by Kajiya, Sutherland and Cheadle. This supported a palette of 256 36-bit RGB colors.\n\nThe palette itself stores a limited number of distinct colors; 4, 16 or \n256 are the most common cases. These limits are often imposed by the \ntarget architecture's display adapter \nhardware, so it is not a coincidence that those numbers are \nexact powers of two (the binary code): \n2 = 4, \n2 = 16 and \n2 = 256. While 256 values can \nbe fit into a single 8-bit byte (and then a single indexed color\npixel also occupies a single byte), pixel indices with 16 (4-bit, a \nnibble) or fewer colors can be packed together into a single byte \n(two nibbles per byte, if 16 colors are employed, or four 2-bit pixels \nper byte if using 4 colors). Sometimes, 1-bit (2-color) values can be \nused, and then up to eight pixels can be packed into a single byte; such\nimages are considered \"binary images\" (sometimes referred as a \n\"bitmap\" or \"bilevel image\") and not an indexed color image.\n\nIf simple video overlay is intended through a \n\"transparent color\", one \npalette entry is specifically reserved for this purpose, and it is \ndiscounted as an available color. Some machines, such as the MSX \nseries, had the transparent color reserved by \nhardware.\n\nIndexed color images with palette sizes beyond 256 entries are rare. The\npractical limit is around 12-bit per pixel, 4,096 different indices. To\nuse indexed 16 bpp or more does not provide the benefits of the indexed\ncolor images' nature, due to the color palette size in bytes being \ngreater than the raw image data itself. Also, useful direct RGB \nHighcolor modes can be used from \n15 bpp and up.\n\nIf an image has many subtle color shades, it is necessary to select a \nlimited repertoire of colors to approximate the image using \ncolor quantization. Such a palette is frequently insufficient to represent \nthe image accurately; difficult-to-reproduce features such as \ngradients will appear blocky or as strips (\"color \nbanding\"). In those cases, it is usual to employ dithering, which\nmixes different-colored pixels in patterns, exploiting the tendency of \nhuman vision to blur nearby pixels together, giving a result visually \ncloser to the original one.\n\nHere is a typical indexed 256-color image and its own palette (shown as a\nrectangle of swatches):\n\nHow the colors are encoded within the color palette map of a given indexed color image depends on the target platform.\n\nMany early personal and home computers had very limited hardware palettes that could produce a very small set of colors. In these cases, each pixel's value mapped directly onto one of these colors. Well-known examples include the Apple II, Commodore 64 and IBM PC CGA, all of which included hardware that could produce a fixed set of 16 colors. In these cases, an image can encode each pixel with 4-bits, directly selecting the color to use. In most cases, however, the display hardware supports additional modes where only a subset of those colors can be used in a single image, a useful technique to save memory. For instance, the CGA's 320×200 resolution mode could show only four of the 16 colors at one time. As the palettes were entirely proprietary, an image generated on one platform cannot be directly viewed properly on another.\n\nOther machines of this era had the ability to generate a larger set of colors, but generally only allowed a subset of those to be used in any one image. Examples include the 256-color palette on Atari 8-bit machines or the 4,096 colors of the VT241 terminal in ReGIS graphics mode. In these cases it was common for the image to only allow a small subset of the total number of colors to be displayed at one time, up to 16 at once on the Atari and VT241. Generally, these systems worked identically to their less-colorful brethren, but a key difference was that there were too many colors in the palette to directly encode in the pixel data given the limited amount of video memory. Instead, they used a colour look-up table (CLUT) where each pixel's data pointed to an entry in the CLUT, and the CLUT was set up under program control. This meant that the image CLUT data had to be stored along with the raw image data in order to be able to re-produce the image correctly.\n\nHardware palettes based on component video colors such as YPbPr or the like were generally replaced in the mid 1980s by the more flexible RGB color model, in which a given color can be obtained by mixing different amounts of the three primary colors red, green, and blue. Although the total number of different colors depends on the number of levels per primary, and on a given hardware implementation (a 9-bit RGB provides 512 combinations, a 12-bit RGB provides 4,096, and so on), in this model Digital-to-Analog Converters (DAC) can generate the colors — simplifying the hardware design — while the software can treat the number per levels used abstractly and manage the RGB colors in a device-independent fashion. With colors stored in RGB format within the palettes of indexed image files, any image can be displayed (through appropriate transformations) on any such system, regardless of the color depth used in the hardware implementation.\n\nToday, display hardware and image file formats that deal with indexed color images almost exclusively manage colors in RGB format, the de facto standard encoding being the so-called truecolor or 24-bit RGB, with 16,777,216 different possible colors. However, indexed color images are not genuinely constrained to a 24-bit RGB color encoding; image palettes can hold any type of color encoding. For example, the PDF file format does support indexed color in other colorspaces, notably CMYK, and Adobe Distiller by default will convert images to indexed color whenever the total number of colors in an image is equal to or less than 256. When using RGB, the TIFF and PNG file formats can optionally store the RGB triplets with a precision of 16-bit (65,536 levels per component) yielding a total of 48 bits per pixel. A proposed extension to the TIFF Standard allows non-RGB color palettes, but this was never implemented in software due to technical reasons. The color map table of the BMP file format indexed color mode stores its entries in BGR order rather than RGB, and has (in the current version) an additional unused byte for padding to conform to 32-bit word alignment during processing, but it is essentially still a 24-bit RGB color encoding. (An earlier version of the BMP format used three bytes per 24-bit color map table entry, and many files in that format are still in circulation, so many modern programs that read BMP files support both variations.)\n\nExcept for very low resolution graphic modes, early home and personal computers rarely implemented an \"all-pixels-addressable\" design - that is, the ability to change a single pixel to any of the available colors independently. Their limitations came from employing separate \"color attribute\" or \"color RAM\" areas, leading to attribute clash effects. Also, the pixel bits and/or the scan lines of the video memory were commonly arranged in odd ways convenient for the video generator hardware (thus saving hardware costs in a cost-competitive market), but sometimes creating difficulty for the people writing graphics programs. A pixel's bits in indexed-color, all-pixel-addressable images are not always contiguous in video memory or image files (i.e., chunky organization is not always used.) Some video hardware, such as the 16-color graphic modes of the Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) and Video Graphics Array (VGA) for IBM PC compatibles\nor the Amiga video buffer\nare arranged as a series of bit planes (in a configuration called planar), in which the related bits of a single pixel are split among several independent bitmaps. Thus, the pixel bits are conceptually aligned along the 3D Z-axis. (The \"depth\" concept here is not the same as that of pixel depth.)\n\nEarly image file formats, such as PIC, stored little more than a bare memory dump of the video buffer of a given machine.\n\nSome indexed-color image file formats such as Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) allow the image's scan lines to be arranged in interleaved fashion (not linear order), which allows a low resolution version of the image to appear on screen while it is still downloading, so that the computer user can gain an idea of its contents during the seconds before the whole image arrives. Here is an example of a typical vertically interleaved download in four steps:\n\nAs seen here, the image has been divided into four groups of lines: group A contains every fourth line, group B contains lines immediately following ones in group A, group C likewise contains the lines immediately following those in group B, and group D contains the remaining lines, which are between group C lines (immediately above) and group A lines (immediately below). These are stored into the file in the order A, C, B, D, so that when the file is transmitted the second received group (C) of lines lie centered between the lines of the first group, yielding the most spatially uniform and recognizable image possible, composed of only two of the groups of lines. The same technique can be applied with more groups (e.g. eight), in which case at each step the next group to be sent contains lines lying at or near the centers of remaining bands that are not yet filled with image data. This method, with four or eight groups of lines, was commonly used on the early World Wide Web during the second half of the 1990s. Rather than leaving the background (black) showing as in the illustration above, the partial image was often presented on screen by duplicating each line to fill the space below it down to the next received image line. The end result was a continuous image with decreased vertical resolution that would increase to full resolution over a few seconds as the later parts of the image data arrived.\n\nIndexed color saves a lot of memory, storage space, and transmission time: using truecolor, each pixel needs 24 bits, or 3 bytes. A typical 640×480 VGA resolution truecolor uncompressed image needs 640×480×3 = 921,600 bytes (900 KiB). Limiting the image colors to 256, every pixel needs only 8 bits, or 1 byte each, so the example image now needs only 640×480×1 = 307,200 bytes (300 KiB), plus 256×3 = 768 additional bytes to store the palette map in itself (assuming RGB), approximately one third of the original size. Smaller palettes (4-bit 16 colors, 2-bit 4 colors) can pack the pixels even more (to one sixth or one twelfth), obviously at cost of color accuracy.\n\nIndexed color was widely used in early personal computers and display adapters' hardware to reduce costs (mainly by requiring fewer of the then-expensive RAM chips) but also for convenient image management with limited-power CPUs (of the order of 4 to 8 MHz), file storage (cassette tapes and low density floppy disks). Notable computer graphics systems extensively (or even exclusively) using pseudocolor palettes in the 1980s include CGA, EGA, and VGA (for IBM PC compatibles), the Atari ST, and Amiga's OCS and AGA.\n\nImage files exchanged over the Compuserve net in the early 1990s were encapsulated in the GIF format. Later, the HTML web pages used the GIF along with other indexed color-supporting file formats such as PNG, to exchange limited-color images quickly and store them in limited storage space.\n\nMost image file formats that support indexed color images also commonly support some compression scheme, enhancing their ability to store the images in smaller files.\n\nInteresting colorized and artistic effects can be easily achieved by altering the color palette of indexed color images, for example to produce colorized sepia tone images. Due to the separate nature of the associated palette element of the indexed color images, they are ideal to remap grayscale images into false color ones through the use of false color palettes.\n\nSimple video overlay can be achieved easily through the transparent color technique.\n\nBy manipulating the color hardware registers (Color look-up table or CLUT) of the display adapter in the indexed color graphic modes, full-screen color-animation effects can be achieved without redrawing the image - that is, at low CPU time cost; a single change of the register values affects the whole screen at once. Color-map animation, also known as Color cycling, is extensively used in the demoscene. The Microsoft Windows boot logo screen in Windows 95, 98, ME, and 2000 Professional (which uses VGA 320x200x256 color display mode because it is the greatest common denominator on all PCs) employs this technique for the scrolling gradient bar across the bottom of the screen; the picture is a static image with no pixels rewritten after it is initially displayed. Custom boot screen images could tap the cycled colors to animate other parts of the images.\n\nThe main disadvantage of using indexed color is the limited set of simultaneous colors per image. Small 4- or 16-color palettes are still acceptable for little images (icons) or very simple graphics, but to reproduce real life images they become nearly useless. Some techniques, such as color quantization, anti-aliasing and dithering combined together can create indexed 256-color images comparable to the original up to an acceptable level.\n\nIndexed color images are heavily dependent on their own color palettes. Except for a few well known fixed-color palettes (such as that of the Color Graphics Adapter—CGA), raw image data and/or color map tables cannot be reliably exchanged between different image files without some kind of intermediate mapping. Also, if the original color palette for a given indexed image is lost, it can be nearly impossible to restore it. Here is an example of what happens when an indexed color image (the previous parrot) has been associated with an incorrect color palette:\n\nIndexed color graphic modes for display adapters have the 16- or 256-color limit imposed by hardware. Indexed color images with rich but incompatible palettes can only be accurately displayed one at a time, as in a slideshow. When it is necessary to show multiple images together, as in a mosaic of thumbnails, a common or \"master palette\" is often used, which encompasses as many different hues as possible into a single set, thereby limiting the overall accurate color availability.\n\nThe following image is a mosaic of four different indexed color images rendered with a single shared \"master palette\" of 6-8-5 levels RGB plus 16 additional grays. Note the limited range of colors used for every image, and how many palette entries are left unused.\n\nMany indexed color display devices do not reach the 24-bit limit for the full RGB palette. The VGA for IBM PC compatibles, for example, only provides an 18-bit RGB palette with 262,144 different possible colors in both 16- and 256- indexed color graphic modes.\n\nSome image editing software allows gamma correction to be applied to a palette for indexed color image files. In general, to apply a gamma correction directly to the color map is bad practice, due to the original RGB color values being lost. It is better to apply the gamma correction with the display hardware (most modern display adapters support this feature), or as an active intermediate step of the rendering software through color management, which preserves the original color values. Only when the indexed color images are intended for systems that lack any kind of color calibration, and they are not intended to be cross-platform, gamma correction may be applied to the color table itself.\n\nThese are some of the most representative image file formats that support indexed color modes. Some of these support other modes (e.g. truecolor), but only the indexed color modes are listed here.\n\n\n\n"}

Publishers purchase ISBNs from an affiliate of the International ISBN Agency.\n\nAn ISBN is assigned to each edition and variation (except reprintings) of a book. For example, an e-book, a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book would each have a different ISBN. The ISBN is 13 digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007, and 10 digits long if assigned before 2007. The method of assigning an ISBN is nation-based and varies from country to country, often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country.\n\nThe initial ISBN configuration of recognition was generated in 1967, based upon the 9-digit Standard Book Numbering (SBN) created in 1966. The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108 (the SBN code can be converted to a ten-digit ISBN by prefixing it with a zero digit \"0\").\n\nPrivately published books sometimes appear without an ISBN. The International ISBN agency sometimes assigns such books ISBNs on its own initiative.\n\nAnother identifier, the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN), identifies periodical publications such as magazines; and the International Standard Music Number (ISMN) covers for musical scores.\n\nThe Standard Book Numbering (SBN) code is a 9-digit commercial book identifier system created by Gordon Foster, Emeritus Professor of Statistics at Trinity College, Dublin, for the booksellers and stationers WHSmith and others in 1965. The ISBN configuration of recognition was generated in 1967 in the United Kingdom by David Whitaker (regarded as the \"Father of the ISBN\") and in 1968 in the United States by Emery Koltay (who later became director of the U.S. ISBN agency R.R. Bowker).\n\nThe 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108. The United Kingdom continued to use the 9-digit SBN code until 1974. ISO has appointed the International ISBN Agency as the registration authority for ISBN worldwide and the ISBN Standard is developed under the control of ISO Technical Committee 46/Subcommittee 9 TC 46/SC 9. The ISO on-line facility only refers back to 1978.\n\nAn SBN may be converted to an ISBN by prefixing the digit \"0\". For example, the second edition of \"Mr. J. G. Reeder Returns\", published by Hodder in 1965, has – 340 indicating the publisher, 01381 their serial number, and 8 being the check digit. This can be converted to ; the check digit does not need to be re-calculated.\n\nSince 1 January 2007, ISBNs have contained 13 digits, a format that is compatible with \"Bookland\" European Article Number EAN-13s.\n\nAn ISBN is assigned to each edition and variation (except reprintings) of a book. For example, an ebook, a paperback, and a hardcover edition of the same book would each have a different ISBN. The ISBN is 13 digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007, and 10 digits long if assigned before 2007. An International Standard Book Number consists of 4 parts (if it is a 10-digit ISBN) or 5 parts (for a 13-digit ISBN):\n\n\nA 13-digit ISBN can be separated into its parts (\"prefix element\", \"registration group\", \"registrant\", \"publication\" and \"check digit\"), and when this is done it is customary to separate the parts with hyphens or spaces. Separating the parts (\"registration group\", \"registrant\", \"publication\" and \"check digit\") of a 10-digit ISBN is also done with either hyphens or spaces. Figuring out how to correctly separate a given ISBN is complicated, because most of the parts do not use a fixed number of digits.\n\nISBN issuance is country-specific, in that ISBNs are issued by the ISBN registration agency that is responsible for that country or territory regardless of the publication language. The ranges of ISBNs assigned to any particular country are based on the publishing profile of the country concerned, and so the ranges will vary depending on the number of books and the number, type, and size of publishers that are active. Some ISBN registration agencies are based in national libraries or within ministries of culture and thus may receive direct funding from government to support their services. In other cases, the ISBN registration service is provided by organisations such as bibliographic data providers that are not government funded.\n\nA full directory of ISBN agencies is available on the International ISBN Agency website. Partial listing:\n\nThe ISBN registration group identifier is a 1- to 5-digit number that is valid within a single prefix element (i.e. one of 978 or 979), and can be separated between hyphens, such as . Registration group identifiers have primarily been allocated within the 978 prefix element. The single-digit group identifiers within the 978-prefix element are: 0 or 1 for English-speaking countries; 2 for French-speaking countries; 3 for German-speaking countries; 4 for Japan; 5 for Russian-speaking countries; and 7 for People's Republic of China. An example 5-digit group identifier is 99936, for Bhutan. The allocated group IDs are: 0–5, 600–622, 65, 7, 80–94, 950–989, 9920–9989, and 99901–99981. Books published in rare languages typically have longer group identifiers.\n\nWithin the 979 prefix element, the registration group identifier 0 is reserved for compatibility with International Standard Music Numbers (ISMNs), but such material is not actually assigned an ISBN. The registration group identifiers within prefix element 979 that have been assigned are 10 for France, 11 for the Republic of Korea, and 12 for Italy.\n\nThe original 9-digit standard book number (SBN) had no registration group identifier, but prefixing a zero (0) to a 9-digit SBN creates a valid 10-digit ISBN.\n\nThe national ISBN agency assigns the registrant element (cf. ) and an accompanying series of ISBNs within that registrant element to the publisher; the publisher then allocates one of the ISBNs to each of its books. In most countries, a book publisher is not required by law to assign an ISBN; however, most bookstores only handle ISBN bearing publications.\n\nA listing of more than 900,000 assigned publisher codes is published, and can be ordered in book form (€1399, US$1959). The web site of the ISBN agency does not offer any free method of looking up publisher codes. Partial lists have been compiled (from library catalogs) for the English-language groups: identifier 0 and identifier 1.\n\nPublishers receive blocks of ISBNs, with larger blocks allotted to publishers expecting to need them; a small publisher may receive ISBNs of one or more digits for the registration group identifier, several digits for the registrant, and a single digit for the publication element. Once that block of ISBNs is used, the publisher may receive another block of ISBNs, with a different registrant element. Consequently, a publisher may have different allotted registrant elements. There also may be more than one registration group identifier used in a country. This might occur once all the registrant elements from a particular registration group have been allocated to publishers.\n\nBy using variable block lengths, registration agencies are able to customise the allocations of ISBNs that they make to publishers. For example, a large publisher may be given a block of ISBNs where fewer digits are allocated for the registrant element and many digits are allocated for the publication element; likewise, countries publishing many titles have few allocated digits for the registration group identifier and many for the registrant and publication elements. Here are some sample <nowiki>ISBN-10</nowiki> codes, illustrating block length variations.\nEnglish-language registration group elements are 0 and 1 (2 of more than 220 registration group elements). These two registration group elements are divided into registrant elements in a systematic pattern, which allows their length to be determined, as follows:\n\nA check digit is a form of redundancy check used for error detection, the decimal equivalent of a binary check bit. It consists of a single digit computed from the other digits in the number. The method for the ten-digit code is an extension of that for SBNs, the two systems are compatible, and SBN prefixed with \"0\" will give the same check-digit as without – the digit is base eleven, and can be 0-9 or X. The system for thirteen-digit codes is not compatible and will, in general, give a different check digit from the corresponding 10-digit ISBN, and does not provide the same protection against transposition. This is because the thirteen-digit code was required to be compatible with the EAN format, and hence could not contain an \"X\".\n\nThe 2001 edition of the official manual of the International ISBN Agency says that the <nowiki>ISBN-10</nowiki> check digit – which is the last digit of the ten-digit ISBN – must range from 0 to 10 (the symbol X is used for 10), and must be such that the sum of all the ten digits, each multiplied by its (integer) weight, descending from 10 to 1, is a multiple of 11.\n\nFor example, for an <nowiki>ISBN-10</nowiki> of 0-306-40615-2:\n\nFormally, using modular arithmetic, we can say:\n\nIt is also true for <nowiki>ISBN-10</nowiki>'s that the sum of all the ten digits, each multiplied by its weight in \"ascending\" order from 1 to 10, is a multiple of 11. For this example:\n\nFormally, we can say:\n\nThe two most common errors in handling an ISBN (e.g., typing or writing it) are a single altered digit or the transposition of adjacent digits. It can be proved that all possible valid <nowiki>ISBN-10</nowiki>'s have at least two digits different from each other. It can also be proved that there are no pairs of valid <nowiki>ISBN-10</nowiki>'s with eight identical digits and two transposed digits. (These are true only because the ISBN is less than 11 digits long, and because 11 is a prime number.)\nThe ISBN check digit method therefore ensures that it will always be possible to detect these two most common types of error, i.e. if either of these types of error has occurred, the result will never be a valid ISBN – the sum of the digits multiplied by their weights will never be a multiple of 11. However, if the error occurs in the publishing house and goes undetected, the book will be issued with an invalid ISBN.\n\nIn contrast, it is possible for other types of error, such as two altered non-transposed digits, or three altered digits, to result in a valid ISBN (although it is still unlikely).\n\nEach of the first nine digits of the ten-digit ISBN—excluding the check digit itself—is multiplied by its (integer) weight, descending from 10 to 2, and the sum of these nine products found. The value of the check digit is simply the one number between 0 and 10 which, when added to this sum, means the total is a multiple of 11.\n\nFor example, the check digit for an <nowiki>ISBN-10</nowiki> of 0-306-40615-\"?\" is calculated as follows:\nAdding 2 to 130 gives a multiple of 11 (132 = 12 x 11) − this is the only number between 0 and 10 which does so. Therefore, the check digit has to be 2, and the complete sequence is <nowiki>ISBN 0-306-40615-2</nowiki>. The value formula_6 required to satisfy this condition might be 10; if so, an 'X' should be used.\n\nAlternatively, modular arithmetic is convenient for calculating the check digit using modulus 11. The remainder of this sum when it is divided by 11 (i.e. its value modulo 11), is computed. This remainder plus the check digit must equal either 0 or 11. Therefore, the check digit is (11 minus the remainder of the sum of the products modulo 11) modulo 11. Taking the remainder modulo 11 a second time accounts for the possibility that the first remainder is 0. Without the second modulo operation the calculation could end up with 11 – 0 = 11 which is invalid. (Strictly speaking the \"first\" \"modulo 11\" is unneeded, but it may be considered to simplify the calculation.)\n\nFor example, the check digit for the <nowiki>ISBN-10</nowiki> of 0-306-40615-\"?\" is calculated as follows:\n\nThus the check digit is 2.\n\nIt is possible to avoid the multiplications in a software implementation by using two accumulators. Repeatedly adding codice_1 into codice_2 computes the necessary multiples:\n\nThe modular reduction can be done once at the end, as shown above (in which case codice_2 could hold a value as large as 496, for the invalid <nowiki>ISBN 99999-999-9-X</nowiki>), or codice_2 and codice_1 could be reduced by a conditional subtract after each addition.\n\nThe 2005 edition of the International ISBN Agency's official manual describes how the 13-digit ISBN check digit is calculated. The <nowiki>ISBN-13</nowiki> check digit, which is the last digit of the ISBN, must range from 0 to 9 and must be such that the sum of all the thirteen digits, each multiplied by its (integer) weight, alternating between 1 and 3, is a multiple of 10.\n\nFormally, using modular arithmetic, we can say:\n\nThe calculation of an <nowiki>ISBN-13</nowiki> check digit begins with the first 12 digits of the thirteen-digit ISBN (thus excluding the check digit itself). Each digit, from left to right, is alternately multiplied by 1 or 3, then those products are summed modulo 10 to give a value ranging from 0 to 9. Subtracted from 10, that leaves a result from 1 to 10. A zero (0) replaces a ten (10), so, in all cases, a single check digit results.\n\nFor example, the <nowiki>ISBN-13</nowiki> check digit of 978-0-306-40615-\"?\" is calculated as follows:\n\nThus, the check digit is 7, and the complete sequence is <nowiki>ISBN 978-0-306-40615-7</nowiki>.\n\nIn general, the <nowiki>ISBN-13</nowiki> check digit is calculated as follows.\n\nLet\n\nThen\n\nThis check system – similar to the UPC check digit formula – does not catch all errors of adjacent digit transposition. Specifically, if the difference between two adjacent digits is 5, the check digit will not catch their transposition. For instance, the above example allows this situation with the 6 followed by a 1. The correct order contributes 3×6+1×1 = 19 to the sum; while, if the digits are transposed (1 followed by a 6), the contribution of those two digits will be 3×1+1×6 = 9. However, 19 and 9 are congruent modulo 10, and so produce the same, final result: both ISBNs will have a check digit of 7. The <nowiki>ISBN-10</nowiki> formula uses the prime modulus 11 which avoids this blind spot, but requires more than the digits 0-9 to express the check digit.\n\nAdditionally, if the sum of the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th digits is tripled then added to the remaining digits (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th), the total will always be divisible by 10 (i.e., end in 0).\n\nThe conversion is quite simple as one only needs to prefix \"978\" to the existing number and calculate the new checksum using the <nowiki>ISBN-13</nowiki> algorithm.\n\nPublishers and libraries have varied policies about the use of the ISBN check digit. Publishers sometimes fail to check the correspondence of a book title and its ISBN before publishing it; that failure causes book identification problems for libraries, booksellers, and readers. For example, is shared by two books – \"Ninja gaiden®: a novel based on the best-selling game by Tecmo\" (1990) and \"Wacky laws\" (1997), both published by Scholastic.\n\nMost libraries and booksellers display the book record for an invalid ISBN issued by the publisher. The Library of Congress catalogue contains books published with invalid ISBNs, which it usually tags with the phrase \"Cancelled ISBN\". However, book-ordering systems such as Amazon.com will not search for a book if an invalid ISBN is entered to its search engine. OCLC often indexes by invalid ISBNs, if the book is indexed in that way by a member library.\n\nOnly the term \"ISBN\" should be used; the terms \"eISBN\" and \"e-ISBN\" have historically been sources of confusion and should be avoided. If a book exists in one or more digital (e-book) formats, each of those formats must have its own ISBN. In other words, each of the three separate EPUB, Amazon Kindle, and PDF formats of a particular book will have its own specific ISBN. They should not share the ISBN of the paper version, and there is no generic \"eISBN\" which encompasses all the e-book formats for a title.\n\nCurrently the barcodes on a book's back cover (or inside a mass-market paperback book's front cover) are EAN-13; they may have a separate barcode encoding five digits called an EAN-5 for the currency and the recommended retail price. For 10-digit ISBNs, the number \"978\", the Bookland \"country code\", is prefixed to the ISBN in the barcode data, and the check digit is recalculated according to the EAN13 formula (modulo 10, 1x and 3x weighting on alternating digits).\n\nPartly because of an expected shortage in certain ISBN categories, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) decided to migrate to a thirteen-digit ISBN (<nowiki>ISBN-13</nowiki>). The process began 1 January 2005 and was planned to conclude 1 January 2007. , all the 13-digit ISBNs began with 978. As the 978 ISBN supply is exhausted, the 979 prefix was introduced. Part of the 979 prefix is reserved for use with the Musicland code for musical scores with an ISMN. The 10-digit ISMN codes differed visually as they began with an \"M\" letter; the bar code represents the \"M\" as a zero (0), and for checksum purposes it counted as a 3. All ISMNs are now 13 digits commencing 979-0; 979-1 to 979-9 will be used by ISBN.\n\nPublisher identification code numbers are unlikely to be the same in the 978 and 979 ISBNs, likewise, there is no guarantee that language area code numbers will be the same. Moreover, the ten-digit ISBN check digit generally is not the same as the thirteen-digit ISBN check digit. Because the GTIN-13 is part of the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) system (that includes the GTIN-14, the GTIN-12, and the GTIN-8), the 13-digit ISBN falls within the 14-digit data field range.\n\nBarcode format compatibility is maintained, because (aside from the group breaks) the <nowiki>ISBN-13</nowiki> barcode format is identical to the EAN barcode format of existing 10-digit ISBNs. So, migration to an EAN-based system allows booksellers the use of a single numbering system for both books and non-book products that is compatible with existing ISBN based data, with only minimal changes to information technology systems. Hence, many booksellers (e.g., Barnes & Noble) migrated to EAN barcodes as early as March 2005. Although many American and Canadian booksellers were able to read EAN-13 barcodes before 2005, most general retailers could not read them. The upgrading of the UPC barcode system to full EAN-13, in 2005, eased migration to the <nowiki>ISBN-13</nowiki> in North America.\n\n\n"}

He is considered to be one of the foremost contributors to the Naïve art genre, with a worldwide reputation.\n\nBrašić was born in 1906 in Oparić near Jagodina. He began painting in 1927, but his earliest dated works are from 1933 (drawings and self-portrait in oil). He is considered as the founder of the Serbian naive art. He died in his birth village of Oparić in 1994, where he lived and worked all his life.\n\n\"I made my self-portrait as a testimony so that my fellow-countrymen would stay calm. If I painted someone else they could accuse me of the lack of resemblance since I got the picture and the man whose portrait I had made wouldn't be there for them to see him immediately. Well, this is how it was!… It was easy for me to make the portrait of myself … I looked at myself in the mirror and that's how I painted.\"\n\nAs a chronicler of his time, he managed for a moment to check the passing of the old and patriarchal way of life, preserving the fluid of the past time. Rustic, elemental realism is his way of maintaining the primeval contact with his environment. Void completely of professional routine, his painting makes a harsh, sonorous impression. In a review of his work, an art critic wrote:\n\"The development of Serbian naive art officially starts with the work of Janko Brašić. His earliest works (portraits) date from 1933. Rustic elementary realism is his way of expressing primordial relations with his surroundings. Lacking professional routine his painting seem bitter and sounding. Scenes are mainly presented in a rural landscape; they possess bright colorization, without explicitly expressed focus. However, the most expressive are his psychological portraits. With almost six decades of fruitful work Janko Brašić will remain the symbol of naive art in Serbia and Oparić will be widely famous as his homeland...\".\n\nHis first group exhibition was organized in 1935 by the Association of Serbian Artists in the Cvijeta Zuzorić Art Pavilion in Belgrade. It was an exhibition of portraits, in which Brašić exhibited a portrait of King Peter II and a self-portrait in oil. Besides scenes from rural life, historical myths and anecdotes – portraits dominate in Brašić's opus. \nThe greatest collection of his paintings is at Museum of Naïve and Marginal Art (MNMA), Jagodina, Serbia.\n\n\n"}

They include the right of attribution, the right to have a work published anonymously or pseudonymously, and the right to the integrity of the work. The preserving of the integrity of the work allows the author to object to alteration, distortion, or mutilation of the work that is \"prejudicial to the author's honor or reputation\". Anything else that may detract from the artist's relationship with the work even after it leaves the artist's possession or ownership may bring these moral rights into play. Moral rights are distinct from any economic rights tied to copyrights. Even if an artist has assigned his or her copyright rights to a work to a third party, he or she still maintains the moral rights to the work.\n\nMoral rights were first recognized in France and Germany, before they were included in the \"Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works\" in 1928. Canada recognizes moral rights (\"droits moraux\") in its \"Copyright Act\" (\"Loi sur le droit d'auteur\"). The United States became a signatory to the convention in 1989, and incorporated a version of moral rights under its copyright law under Title 17 of the U.S. Code.\n\nSome jurisdictions allow for the waiver of moral rights. In the United States, the \"Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990 (VARA)\" recognizes moral rights, but applies only to a narrow subset of works of visual art.\n\nSome jurisdictions like Austria differentiate between narrow and wide moral rights. Whilst the former is about integrity of the work, the latter limits usages, which may harm the author's integrity. Some copyright timestamp services allow an author to publish allowed and disallowed usage intentions to prevent a violation of such wider moral rights.\n\nThrough the Rome Revision of the Berne Convention in 1928, the Berne Convention accepted two forms of moral rights; paternity and integrity. These rights are included in Article 6bis of the \"Berne Convention\" as follows:\n\nIndependent of the author's economic rights, and even after the transfer of the said rights, the author shall have the right to claim authorship of the work and to object to any distortion, modification of, or other derogatory action in relation to the said work, which would be prejudicial to the author's honor or reputation.\n\nLegend:\n\nIn most of Europe, it is not possible for authors to assign or even waive their moral rights. This is following a tradition in European copyright itself, which is regarded as an item of property which cannot be sold, but only licensed. Parties certainly can agree not to enforce them (and such terms are very common in contracts in Europe). There may also be a requirement for the author to 'assert' these moral rights before they can be enforced. In many books, for example, this is done on a page near the beginning, in and amongst the British Library/Library of Congress data.\n\nSection 14.1 of Canada's Copyright Act protects the moral rights of authors. The moral rights cannot be assigned, but can be waived contractually. Many publishing contracts in Canada now contain a standard moral right waiver.\n\nMoral rights in Canada were famously exercised in the case of \"Snow v. The Eaton Centre Ltd.\" In this case Toronto Eaton Centre, a large shopping mall, had commissioned the artist Michael Snow for a sculpture of Canada Geese. Snow successfully stopped Eaton's from decorating the geese with bows at Christmas.\n\nArticle 20 of the provides unlimited term of protection of the rights of authorship, alteration, and integrity of an author. As Article 55 of the same Law provides retroactive protection of unexpired term on the date of entry into force of this Law, the Chinese perpetual moral rights are retroactive as well. The version retains this provision and the original Article 55 becomes Article 59.\n\nArt. 18, Copyright Act, 2005 provides perpetual moral rights. The moral rights in Art. 6 are for proper attribution and against any distortion, mutilation or other modification of the work where that act would be or is prejudicial to the reputation of the author or where the work is discredited by the act.\n\nMoral Rights is specified under Copyright Ordinance (Chapter 528) Division IV, starting from section 89. Author of computer program does not have Moral Rights (section 91). Moral Rights cannot be transferred unless on the death of moral rights holder (section 105 and 106).\n\nMoral rights are recognised under section 57 of India copyright act. Section 57 of India Copyright act refers to Author's Special rights. It states:\n\nThe issue of moral rights was discussed in Amar Nath Sehgal V Union of India & Ors.(Amar Nath Sehgal V Union of India & Ors CS/OS/No.2074/1992 decided on 21st Feb 2005. Court of Mr. Justice Pradeep Nandrajog). The case pertained to a mural that was commissioned in 1957 by Government of India during construction of Vigyan Bhavan at New Delhi. The mural in question was made of bronze had span of 140 feet sweep of 40 feet. The mural remained on display and was much appreciated till pulled down in 1979 and then consigned to storerooms of Union of India. Delhi High Court specifically referred to Berne Convention in delivering judgement. Court also awarded damages Rs. 500000 (half million) and also decreed in favor of the Amar Nath Sehgal that he would have an absolute right to recreate the mural at any place and right to sale the same.\n\nThe Court accepted existence of moral rights despite the work being commissioned work and copyright had passed over to union of India and suit being brought 13years after the said act(defense of limitations as pleaded by Government was rejected by the court).\n\nArticle 41 of the Decree-Law_n.o_43/99/M provides inalienable, unrenounceable and imprescriptible author’s personal rights.\n\nIn Taiwan, the Copyright Act has provided authors' perpetual moral rights with regard of attribution and protection against alteration in bad faith, even if the works are in the public domain, as follows:\n\nMoral rights have had a less robust tradition in the United States. Copyright law in the United States emphasizes protection of financial reward over protection of creative attribution. The exclusive rights tradition in the United States is inconsistent with the notion of moral rights as it was constituted in the Civil Code tradition stemming from post-Revolutionary France. When the United States acceded to the Berne Convention, it stipulated that the Convention's \"moral rights\" provisions were addressed sufficiently by other statutes, such as laws covering slander and libel.\n\nSome individual states have moral rights laws, particularly pertaining to visual art and artists (\"See\", \"e.g.\" California Art Preservation Act, Artists Authorship Rights Act (New York)). However, it is unclear if these laws, or portions thereof, are preempted by federal laws, such as the Visual Artists Rights Act.\n\nIn \"Gilliam v. American Broadcasting\", the Monty Python comedy troupe made a claim of \"mutilation\" (akin to a moral rights claim) in 1975 in legal proceedings against American TV network ABC for airing re-edited versions of \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\". However, the case was primarily decided on the basis of whether the BBC was licensed in such a way as to allow ABC to edit the videos (paragraph 20).\n\nThe Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990 grants authors of a \"work of visual art\" - e.g. photographs, paintings, sculptures, etc. - the non-transferable right to\n\n\nThese rights are distinct from any rights of copyright and ownership of a copy of the work.\n\nCopyright holders have the right to control adaptations, or the preparation of \"derivative works\". This right is given under copyright law. \"See\" 17 U.S.C. § 106.\n\nSection 43 of the Lanham Act governs false and misleading advertising, and can apply in some instances to attribution of protected works. However, it cannot be used to create moral rights for works outside of the Act. \"See\" \"Dastar v. Twentieth Century Fox\".\n\nAuthors occasionally wish to distance themselves from work they've been involved with, some to the point of not wishing to be recognized as the work's author. One way they may do this is by signing the work under a pseudonym. Alan Smithee was a traditional, collective pseudonym used between 1968 and 1999 by discontented Hollywood film directors who no longer wanted to be credited. This courtesy was not always extended, however. The director of \"\", Russell Mulcahy, wanted his name removed after the completion bond company took over film production, but he was contractually obliged not to impugn the film and he was told that using a pseudonym would impugn it.\n\nIf the work was unfinished, sometimes the original author will choose a pseudonym as permission for the copyright holder to do whatever they wish to finish and market the unwanted work, cutting ties from the product.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32498974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32498974", "title": "Music censorship", "text": "Music censorship\n\nCensorship of music refers to the practice of editing of musical works for various reasons, stemming from a wide variety of motivations, including moral, political, or religious reasons. Censorship can range from the complete government-enforced legal prohibition of a musical work, to private, voluntary removal of content when a musical work appears in a certain context.\n\nSongs are commonly edited for broadcast on radio and television to remove content that may be considered objectionable to an outlet's target audience—such as profanity, or references to subjects such as sex and drug usage. This is typically done to comply with any relevant broadcast law or codes of conduct, and to make the songs more marketable to a mainstream audience. Songs edited for content in this manner by are often referred to as a \"clean version\" or a \"radio edit\" (the latter also referring to songs that may be edited for length on radio airplay, and in the past, space limitations on 45 RPM vinyl records). Common editing techniques include distorting vocals to obscure offending words (including muting, bleeping, and backmasking), or replacing them with alternative lyrics.\n\nThe amount of censorship required may vary between broadcasters, depending on standards and practices and their target audience; for example, Radio Disney imposes stricter content guidelines than conventional U.S. radio stations, as it primarily targets a youth audience and family listening. By contrast, some radio stations may relegate unedited versions of tracks containing objectionable content to airplay during time periods deemed appropriate, such as late-night hours. Joel Mullis, an Atlanta sound engineer who became well-known in the industry for his work on radio edits, noted that his job was often complicated by differing standards between broadcasters (such as BET and MTV), requiring different edits to meet their individual needs. Mullis' edit of the Ying Yang Twins' \"Wait (The Whisper Song)\" was constructed by splicing in vocals from other Ying Yang Twins songs, but Mullis eventually had to bring the group back to his studio after facing demands for additional edits.\n\nIn some cases, a record label may choose to withhold a release entirely if they believe that its subject matter would be too controversial; Ice-T and Paris both had gangsta rap albums withheld or indefinitely delayed by Warner Bros. Records over content concerns, with Ice-T's \"Home Invasion\" delayed due to the 1992 Los Angeles riots and controversy over \"Cop Killer\"—a song by Ice-T's metal band Body Count, and Paris's \"Sleeping with the Enemy\" over its songs \"Bush Killa\" and \"Coffee, Doughnuts, & Death\". Insane Clown Posse faced similar issues after they signed to Disney-owned Hollywood Records; despite compliance with the label's demands to censor specific songs and lyrics, \"The Great Milenko\" was recalled almost immediately after its release (but not before selling 18,000 copies out of 100,000 shipped). All three acts moved to different labels (including Priority Records and Island Records), which released their respective albums without objections.\n\nMultiple edits of CeeLo Green's song \"Fuck You\" exist, including one which changed the titular lyric to \"Forget You\", and one which muted \"fuck\" without replacing it. Green also performed a parody of the song about Fox News in an appearance on \"The Colbert Report\". The Black Eyed Peas re-wrote \"Let's Get Retarded\"—a song from their album \"Elephunk\", as \"Let's Get It Started\" to serve as a promotional song for television coverage of the 2004 NBA Playoffs. \"Let's Get It Started\" was subsequently released as a standalone single. When performing his song \"Power\" on \"Saturday Night Live\", Kanye West similarly replaced an entire verse, which contained profanities as well as lyrics directly criticising the program (such as \"Fuck \"SNL\" and the whole cast\") with newly-written lyrics.\n\nSongs containing potentially objectionable double entendres or mondegreens have also been subject to censorship. For example, the title and chorus of Britney Spears' single \"If U Seek Amy\" was intended to be misheard as \"F-U-C-K me\"; her label issued a radio edit which changed the word \"seek\" to \"see\", in order to remove the wordplay. Similar concerns were raised by radio stations over The Black Eyed Peas' \"Don't Phunk With My Heart\" upon its release, as the word \"phunk\" (a deliberate misspelling of \"funk\") could be misinterpreted by listeners as sounding like the word \"fuck\". Meghan Trainor recorded an alternate version of her debut single \"All About That Bass\" for Radio Disney and conservative adult contemporary stations, which removed the song's suggestive metaphors.\n\nCensorship of music is not limited to lyrical content; MTV edited the M.I.A. song \"Paper Planes\" to replace sounds of gunfire in its chorus with alternative sound effects, and remove a reference to cannabis. Similar sound edits occurred when M.I.A. performed the same song on \"Late Show with David Letterman\" (broadcast by then-corporate sibling CBS). M.I.A. subsequently criticized both MTV and \"Late Show\" for censoring her song.\n\nSome listeners have expressed dissatisfaction over the editing of songs for radio airplay, arguing that it compromises the artistic integrity of the original song, and encourage listeners to seek out alternative platforms that are not subject to such censorship, such as digital streaming. At the same time, edits are considered a necessary concession to receive the radio airplay that can influence a song's overall performance. N.W.A.'s debut album \"Straight Outta Compton\" (which had attracted controversy for its song \"Fuck tha Police\") contains a song entitled \"Express Yourself\", which criticizes radio censorship of music as inhibiting free expression, and also criticizes other rappers for releasing inoffensive songs without profanity in order to receive radio airplay. Despite its themes, \"Express Yourself\" is the only song on the album to not contain profanities.\n\nSome songs may be pulled or downplayed by broadcasters if they are considered to be inappropriate to play in the aftermath of specific events. Following the September 11 attacks, many broadcasters altered their music programming for these reasons, such as Clear Channel, whose program directors compiled an internal list of \"lyrically questionable\" songs. The list included all Rage Against the Machine songs, as well as various songs with themes related to war, destruction, flight, or New York City. \"Slate\" noted several unusual choices on the list, including \"Walk Like an Egyptian\", two Cat Stevens songs (Stevens had converted to the Islamic faith and changed his name to Yusuf Islam), and John Lennon's \"explicitly pacifist anthem 'Imagine'\".\n\nFollowing the Space Shuttle \"Columbia\" disaster in February 2003, Mark Wills' \"19 Somethin'\" was temporarily pulled by some radio stations as it contains a lyric referencing the \"Challenger\" disaster. Also that month, Madonna's then-upcoming music video for \"American Life\" generated controversy due to its politicized and \"unpatriotic\" imagery (such as a fashion show featuring women dressed in military equipment, and a scene where the singer throws a grenade-shaped lighter to a George W. Bush lookalike to light his cigar), which were considered to be especially sensitive in the wake of the Iraq war. Due to the negative response, Madonna pulled the video prior to its planned premiere, as she did not want to \"risk offending anyone who might misinterpret the meaning of this video\".\n\nIn 2006, after Gary Glitter was convicted of child sexual abuse in Vietnam, the National Football League banned the original recording of his song \"Rock and Roll\" (which was popularly played at U.S. sporting events) from being played at its games. While the NFL still allowed a cover version of the song to be played, in 2012 the league instructed its teams to \"avoid\" playing the song entirely, following negative reception from British media over its continued use by the New England Patriots, and the possibility it could be played during Super Bowl XLVI.\n\nFollowing Chris Brown's alleged physical altercation with his then-girlfriend Rihanna, various radio stations began to voluntarily pull Brown's music from their playlists as a condemnation of his actions. In December 2013, HMV removed the entire catalogue of Lostprophets from its stores after the band's lead singer Ian Watkins was charged with thirteen sexual offences against children.\n\nSongs and albums may, in some cases, be censored due to copyright problems (particularly related to sampling) or other legal issues. The JAMs album \"1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)\" was withdrawn from distribution following complaints by ABBA, whose music was sampled on the album without permission. The Notorious B.I.G.'s album \"Ready to Die\" was similarly pulled following a lawsuit by Bridgeport Music over unauthorized samples.\n\nBy request of Atlantic Records, parody musician \"Weird Al\" Yankovic did not commercially release \"You're Pitiful\"—his parody of James Blunt's song \"You're Beautiful\", even though Blunt himself had approved of the satire. It was subsequently released as a free single instead.\n\nThe Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and the Australian Music Retailers Association (AMRA) maintain a self-regulatory system known as the \"Recorded Music Labelling Code of Practice\", which utilizes a three-tier ratings system for objectionable content in music recordings. \"Level 1\" applies to content of a \"moderate impact\" (including \"infrequent aggressive or strong coarse language; or\nmoderate-impact references to drug use, violence, sexual activity or themes\"), \"Level 2\" for \"strong impact\" (\"frequent aggressive or strong coarse language\", or strong references to drug use, violence, sexual activity or themes), and \"Level 3\" for \"high impact\" content (graphic and high-impact references to drug use, violence, sexual activity or themes). The Level 3 classification was introduced in March 2003, and requires purchasers to be over the age of 18. The code bans the distribution or sale of any recording with material that exceeds Level 3 classification, which includes content \"which promote, incite, instruct or exploitatively or gratuitously depict drug abuse, cruelty, suicide, criminal or sexual violence, child abuse, incest, bestiality or any other revolting or abhorrent activity in a way that causes outrage or extreme disgust.\"\n\nAustralian customs law also bans the import of any product that \"describe[s], depict[s], express[es] or otherwise deal[s] with matters of sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime, cruelty, violence or revolting or abhorrent phenomena in such a way that they offend against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults\". In 2003, copies of an album by grindcore band Intense Hammer Rage were seized by the Australian Customs Service, and the three band members were each fined AUD$500 each for violating customs law. The violations centred upon the abhorrent subject matter of the album's artwork and printed lyrics; the albums had been manufactured in the United States by their record label, and imported into Australia for their distribution. The band criticized the seizure as being a dilution of freedom of speech.\n\nIn May 1990, Nick Franklin, acting news director of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's radio station Triple J, was suspended by the ABC's management after having played a portion of N.W.A.'s song \"Fuck tha Police\". The song had received airplay on the station for several months, but ABC Radio head Malcom Long requested that the song be given a \"rest\"; in the offending segment, Franklin discussed the song's vulgar lyrics and subject matter. In protest of the suspension, Triple J staff went on strike, and the station stunted by playing the N.W.A. song \"Express Yourself\" on a loop. The stunt ended after the ABC resolved the dispute and reinstated Long. The song was ultimately played 82 times in a row.\n\nIn Canada, content broadcast by radio and television is self-regulated under the code of ethics of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters by a group known as the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC), which acts upon complaints submitted by the general public. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) can intervene in more substantial cases. \n\nIn 2011, the Atlantic panel of the CBSC, in response to a complaint against CHOZ-FM, ruled that the original version of Dire Straits' 1985 single, \"Money for Nothing\" violated the ethics code, because of its use of the word \"faggot\"—a homophobic slur. However, the CRTC called upon the CBSC to review the decision with a national panel, as it \"elicited a strong public reaction and created uncertainty for private radio stations across the country.\" In particular, the CRTC asked the CBSC to consider the overall context of the slur in relation to the rest of the song, as well as how the word was used at the time of the song's release. The CBSC overturned the ruling; while panellists agreed that the slur was inappropriate, it was considered to be satirical and non-hateful in context. It was also noted that lead singer Mark Knopfler had substituted the word himself with alternatives (such as \"queenie\") during live performances, which was considered an admission that his original choice in words was in bad taste. The CBSC stated that it was up to individual stations whether or not they would play the unedited version.\n\nThe ruling and controversy were ridiculed by critics; veteran Canadian radio personality Alan Cross commented that the controversy made Canada look \"silly\", remarking that \"I talked to people from the U.S. and the U.K. and they were like, 'What's wrong with you people? Don't you get it? It's a joke. It's a satire. You didn't understand the context?\" \"National Post\" columnist Chris Selley described the CBSC's new ruling as a \"comedy classic\" and \"colossal waste of time\", explaining that \"it's one thing for a censor to decide whether something is legitimately artistic; it's another for it to declare whether or not it enjoys the art, as if it somehow mattered.\"\n\nDuring the rule of Mao Zedong, \"Yellow Music\" became subject to criticism and censure, since the Communist Party of China saw Shanghai \"shidaiqu\" pop music as indecent, and critics saw the sentiments of love songs as appealing only to the \"petite bourgeoisie\". The genre was also criticized over its connections to American jazz music, due to Anti-American sentiment from the Korean War. This resulted in many artists associated with shidaiqu, including Li Jinhui (who had been credited as a leading figure in the genre) and Chen Gexin, being branded as \"rightists\" and persecuted. Shanghai pop was displaced by revolutionary music that promoted Maoism and other ideologies of the Communist Party. In 1966, Tian Han—writer of the Chinese national anthem \"March of the Volunteers\"—was imprisoned over his allegorical play \"Xie Yaohuan\" (which was critical of Mao's regime) in one of the opening salvos of the Cultural Revolution. His works were banned, leading to \"The East is Red\"—a song which glorified Mao's cult of personality, being used as the \"de facto\" national anthem at this time.\n\nIn contemporary times, musical works criticizing the Chinese government have also been subject to censure. Guns N' Roses' album \"Chinese Democracy\" was banned in the country, as its title track criticizes the Chinese government and contains references to the Falun Gong. The song \"Legacy\" on Pet Shop Boys' 2009 album \"Yes\" was changed to an instrumental for its Chinese release, as it contains the lyric \"governments fall\". In July 2017, it was reported that Justin Bieber had been banned from performing in the country, citing \"a series of bad behaviours, both in his social life and during a previous performance in China, which caused discontent among the public.\"\n\nChina has historically condemned or banned any musician who publicly supports Tibetan independence or otherwise interacts with the Dalai Lama; in 2008, Björk chanted \"Tibet, Tibet\" to the audience whilst performing \"Declare Independence\" during a concert in Shanghai. Zhou Heping stated that the song, which was not cleared by Chinese authorities, had caused \"dissatisfaction among the broader Chinese audience\". He described Björk's case as an isolated incident, and denied that the Ministry of Culture was wanting to further restrict performances by Western acts in the country in response to the incident, since China wanted international musicians to perform there for the Summer Olympics. In 2013, German electronic music band Kraftwerk were denied entry visas over their intent to perform at a 1999 Free Tibet concert in Washington, D.C., which was cancelled due to inclement weather. Maroon 5 had concerts cancelled in the country after bandmember Jesse Carmichael posted a Twitter message for the Dalai Lama's 80th birthday, and Oasis concerts in China were cancelled after lead singer Noel Gallagher performed at a Free Tibet concert in New York City. In 2016, the Publicity Department banned Lady Gaga after she posted a video of her meeting with the Dalai Lama prior to a conference in Indianapolis.\n\nIn July 2016, South Korean music and entertainment products became subject to a voluntary boycott in China, in retaliation for its stationing of a THAAD missile defence system to protect against attacks by North Korea (which has diplomatic ties with China). K-pop groups, as well as soprano Sumi Jo, had performances cancelled in the country due to the sentiment. Share prices of S.M. Entertainment and YG Entertainment also fell, as South Korean entertainment companies had increasingly invested in China to take advantage of the Korean Wave. In November 2017, following the settlement of the THAAD dispute, Chinese media outlets began to ease their censure of K-pop content.\n\nThe German composers Richard Strauss and Richard Wagner have been considered controversial figures in Israel due to their associations with Nazi Germany, in addition to Wagner's displays of antisemitism towards the Jewish faith. Although the works of Strauss have since been performed in the country, there is still an informal \"ban\" on the live performance of Wagner's works, with concerts intending to do so having faced resistance and protests by Israelis. Despite this, local broadcasters such as radio stations have still played Wagner's music without controversy.\n\nIn Malaysia, a Muslim-majority country, local law prohibits radio stations from playing songs that are \"offensive to public feeling\" or \"violate good taste and decency\". References to LGBT topics were censored from Lady Gaga's \"Born This Way\" by local radio stations because homosexual acts are illegal in the country, while \"Despacito\" was pulled by Malaysia's state-owned radio stations following listener concerns over its \"un-Islamic\" lyrics.\n\nConcerts in Malaysia have also been subject to censorship to comply with the country's moral values; Avril Lavigne was instructed to not wear revealing clothing, jump, shout, or include any \"negative elements\" in a 2008 concert in Kuala Lumpur, Muslim citizens were initially banned from attending a Black Eyed Peas concert in 2009 due to its Guinness sponsorship, as alcohol is banned under Sharia law (the ban was lifted after Guinness agreed to cease advertising its involvement nor sell its products at the event), and Adam Lambert agreed to make changes to a 2010 concert due to concerns that he would promote \"gay culture\".\n\nMusic of North Korea is typically limited to state-sanctioned performers and ensembles, whose propaganda music promotes the regime's ideologies and the cult of personality. Foreign music, and older North Korean music that do not meet the government's standards, is generally banned. In July 2015, it was reported that Kim-jong Un had issued a directive calling for inspectors to destroy music CDs and cassettes containing prohibited content, as well as adding additional songs to the blacklist (such as the entire soundtrack of the historical drama \"Im Kkeok Jeong\").\n\nCritics have argued that Kim Jong-un's regime was selectively becoming more open to having some Western influence over its culture, citing the inclusion of Western music (such as selections from the soundtrack of the film \"Rocky\", and the song \"My Way\") and imagery in the July 2012 debut performance of the Moranbong Band—an all-female military ensemble. In July 2015, it was announced that Slovenian band Laibach would perform in Pyongyang as part of celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the end of Japanese rule. It was the first ever rock music concert in the country; the band stated that they planned to perform covers of traditional songs and selections from \"The Sound of Music\".\n\nDue to tense relations between Japan and South Korea following the end of Japanese rule, the Korean government imposed various restrictions on the importation of cultural works from other countries—laws ostensibly meant to target Japan. In September 1999, South Korea lifted its ban on live performances of Japanese music, but only in venues with a capacity smaller than 2000. In June 2000, it became legal to perform Japanese music in larger venues, and to sell music recordings originating from Japan. However, until January 2004, it remained illegal to sell recordings containing Japanese-language lyrics. It remains illegal to broadcast Japanese music over terrestrial radio and television in South Korea. \n\nTo appeal to the country's conservatism, television broadcasters have sometimes pulled music videos from airplay for containing content they deem to be inappropriate, such as violent or sexually suggestive content. While Korea's three major television networks—KBS, MBC, and SBS—have all banned videos at some point, the public broadcaster KBS is known for doing so more often due to its stricter regulations, which additionally forbid songs that encourage inappropriate behaviour (especially among youth), or contain references to brand names or Japanese words. This results in some songs, such as Psy's \"Gentleman\" (which was banned by KBS for a scene in which the singer kicks over a traffic cone) being banned only by KBS, but still receiving airplay by other networks.\n\nIn 2010, the Supreme Court of South Korea ruled that it was illegal under the National Security Act to possess music that praises North Korea, even if instrumental, as it constitutes an \"enemy-benefiting expression\".\n\nThe telecommunications regulator Ofcom has the power to reprimand broadcasters for playing songs and music videos that breach its guidelines on harmful or offensive content pre-watershed. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) adopted the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) Parental Advisory label program; in July 2011, the BPI published guidance for use of the logo on digital streaming platforms. \n\nThe BBC was historically known for censoring various songs from being played on its radio and television stations; from the 1930s through 1960s, the BBC had banned songs such as \"Hold My Hand\" for its religious references, pop arrangements of classical tunes (though barring \"Sabre Dance\" because it was \"not a well-loved classic whose perversion we would be encouraging\"), and during World War II, songs that were \"slushy in sentiment\", such as \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\", due to concerns that it would affect the morale of soldiers. \"Mack the Knife\" was also banned from airplay outside of \"The Threepenny Opera\", as the BBC felt it would be offensive outside of the context of the play. The Kinks' \"Lola\" was briefly banned under the BBC's anti-product placement rules, as its lyrics contain references to the brand name Coca-Cola. In the midst of an American tour, lead singer Ray Davies flew back to London to re-record the offending lyric as \"cherry cola\".\n\nThe Sex Pistols' 1977 single \"God Save the Queen\" was controversial upon its release, as it was critical of the British government and monarchy (among other things, referring to the United Kingdom as a \"fascist regime\"), and was released during the year of Queen Elizabeth II's silver jubilee. \"God Save the Queen\" was banned by the BBC and all independent local radio stations, but still peaked at #2 on the UK Singles Chart during the week of the official Jubilee celebration. It was alleged that the chart's rules were changed for that week only to exclude sales from record shops that sold their own records (in this case, Virgin), in a deliberate effort to prevent the controversial song from reaching the number-one spot and causing wider offence.\n\nThe Frankie Goes to Hollywood song \"Relax\" generated controversy due to its suggestive lyrics; the chorus contained double entendres such as \"when you want to suck to it\" and \"when you want to come\", which were interpreted as being oblique references to oral sex and ejaculation respectively. On 11 January 1984, Radio 1 morning DJ Mike Read stopped the song on-air during a chart rundown to point out its \"obscene\" lyrics, and announced that he would no longer play the song during his show. The BBC subsequently restricted the song to evening airplay. When the band made statements in a \"Daily Express\" interview confirming the possibility of sexual connotations in the lyrics, the BBC banned \"Relax\" entirely. The ban only increased interest in the single, causing it to become the number-one song in Britain only two weeks later.\n\nIn December 2007, BBC Radio 1 began to play a version of The Pogues' popular Christmas song \"Fairytale of New York\" that censored the words \"faggot\" and \"slut\" from one of its verses. The BBC cited concerns over the homophobic slurs as reasoning, despite the song having historically been played without censorship. The BBC reversed the decision after it was criticized by listeners, the band itself, and the mother of the song's featured vocalist Kirsty MacColl. Radio 1 controller Andy Parfitt argued that \"While we would never condone prejudice of any kind, we know our audiences are smart enough to distinguish between maliciousness and creative freedom. In the context of this song, I do not feel that there is any negative intent behind the use of the words, hence the reversal of the decision.\"\n\nAs the song's subject matter was deemed too inappropriate for airplay pre-watershed, BBC Radio 1 played an edited version of Rihanna's song \"S&M\" during the daytime hours, and referred to the song using the alternate title \"Come On\". As Rihanna objected to the censorship of the song's title, the BBC later compromised by referring to the song as \"S&M (Come On)\". For the same reasons, Ofcom deemed the song's music video to be unfit for broadcast pre-watershed.\n\nAfter the 2013 death of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, \"Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead\" from the film \"The Wizard of Oz\" reached #2 on the UK Singles Chart, as the result of a social media campaign celebrating the death of the controversial PM. BBC Radio 1 did not play the full song during \"The Official Chart\" programme, and instead played a short snippet accompanied by a \"Newsbeat\" report about the campaign. The action led to complaints that the BBC were deliberately censoring the song due to its negativity in this context, noting that \"I'm in Love with Margaret Thatcher\" (which also charted, albeit lower, as part of a campaign to counter the aforementioned \"Witch\" campaign) was played in full earlier in the show. The BBC Trust's Editorial Standards Committee upheld its decision not to play the song, due to its context as a celebration of Thatcher's death.\n\n\"Liar Liar GE2017\", a song released during the run-up to the 2017 general election that is critical of prime minister Theresa May, was not played by British radio stations due to broadcasting regulations in force during electoral campaigns, which forbid political advertising and require impartial coverage. Despite the suppression, the song still managed to reach #4 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nWhile music can be classified as a protected form of expression under the First Amendment, there have still been instances of voluntary censorship within the music industry, particularly in regards to protecting children from being exposed to age-inappropriate subject matter, corporate objections to an artist's work, and by radio and television stations to remain in compliance with the regulations of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The 1978 Supreme Court case \"FCC v. Pacifica Foundation\" established that the FCC had the power to regulate the broadcast of content considered \"indecent\" on terrestrial radio and television.\n\nIn 1985, the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), founded by Tipper Gore, published the \"Filthy Fifteen\"—a list of fifteen songs it deemed to be the most objectionable due to their references to drugs and alcohol, sexual acts, violence, or \"occult\" activities. The group pushed for the adoption of a ratings system, and for lyrics to be printed on the back covers of albums so they could be previewed by parents. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) opposed these proposals; during a Senate hearing on the matter in September, musicians such as John Denver and Frank Zappa argued that such guidelines would inhibit free expression. Zappa, in particular, argued that the PMRC's proposal for a method to \"assist baffled parents in the determination of the 'suitability' of records listened to by 'very young children'\" would reduce American music to \"the intellectual level of a Saturday morning cartoon\".\n\nFollowing the hearings, the RIAA introduced a standard Parental Advisory label (which took its current form, reading \"Parental Advisory — Explicit Content\", in 1994 following subsequent hearings), which is designed to be applied to the cover art of songs and albums which may contain objectionable content; the RIAA recommends that it be used on releases containing \"strong language or depictions of violence, sex, or substance abuse to such an extent as to merit parental notification.\" The Parental Advisory label is a voluntary scheme; some retailers—particularly Walmart—adopted policies to enforce the label program by not stocking music releases which carried it.\n\nGangsta rap generated controversies due to its often-provocative subject matter. \"Fuck tha Police\", a song from N.W.A.'s debut album \"Straight Outta Compton\", proved to be particularly controversial. The song criticized police brutality and racial profiling, and contained lyrics condoning violence against police officers. Civil rights activist C. Delores Tucker was also notable for her opposition to gangsta rap. She was known for distributing flyers outside record stores, buying stock in media companies so she could protest the songs at shareholders' meetings. Tucker was notably dissed in other songs over her criticism of the genre, including Tupac's \"How Do U Want It\"—which prompted Tucker to sue Tupac's estate for emotional distress and slander. The suit was later dismissed. \n\nIn 1990, Floridan political activist Jack Thompson targeted the Miami-based 2 Live Crew and their album \"As Nasty As They Wanna Be\" (which featured songs such as \"Me So Horny\"), claiming that it was obscene. In March 1990, the group filed a lawsuit in a U.S. district court to overturn a Broward County ruling that declared the album obscene, but it was upheld by Judge Jose Alejandro Gonzalez Jr. In 1992, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the Gonzalez ruling, as the case presented insufficient evidence that the album met the definition of obscenity set by the Supreme Court (which includes a lack of artistic merit). \n\nThe television channel MTV was also known for censoring objectionable content from music videos, and restricting some particularly-controversial videos to late-night airplay—such as The Prodigy's \"Smack My Bitch Up\" due to its violent imagery and misogynistic lyrics, and Sir Mix-a-Lot's \"Baby Got Back\" for its suggestive subject matter. Several Madonna videos have also been banned by the channel, including the sexually-explicit \"Justify My Love\" and \"Erotica\". Due to its violent content, MTV and sister channel VH1 only played \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" once in late-night hours for its world premiere, and subsequently refused to add it to their regular rotation. The women's cable network Oxygen subsequently provided airplay for the video.\n\nOn February 1, 2004 during the MTV-produced Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show (which was televised by its corporate sister CBS), Janet Jackson's breast was exposed by Justin Timberlake at the conclusion of the show, in an apparent \"wardrobe malfunction\". In response to the show, as well as other recent incidents surrounding unexpected use of profanities by those appearing on live television programs (referred to as a \"fleeting expletive\"), the FCC launched a major crackdown against indecent material broadcast on terrestrial radio and television stations. Some rock radio stations removed or censored certain songs so they would not run afoul of the stricter enforcement, while MTV moved several videos with sexually suggestive imagery to late-night hours. Viacom, which owned MTV, CBS, and the radio station group Infinity Broadcasting at the time, also blacklisted Jackson and her music from its properties, and removed her from the CBS-televised 46th Grammy Awards the following week—where she was scheduled to introduce a tribute to Luther Vandross. The blacklisting caused Janet Jackson's album \"Damita Jo\", which was released the following month, to underperform due to reduced promotion and single airplay.\n\nAlthough music has been big element when it comes to the pre-Islamic cultures of Iran it became confined in courts or performed by street artists after Iran spread. Music played a large role in the lives of Islamic people. However, they were eventually told they must do without it. In fact it got to the point where music was entirely eliminated meaning no concerts were allowed of any kind and musical instruments were to be destroyed back in the late 70’s. Iran’s reason for eliminating music was because it was believed to be betraying their country and its youth. \n"}

Though the U.S. remained the largest if licensing fees are included into the figures. However, in the following year, Japan fell back to the second-largest music market after experiencing a 16.7 per cent decrease due to the country's reliance of CDs and slow adoption of digital services.\n\nIn 2015, the digital music market in China is expected to be worth . China is expected to become one of the largest music markets in the world by 2020.\n\nAlthough global physical music sales (such as CDs) have been declining in recent years, in East Asia (particularly Japan and South Korea), however, physical music sales have been rising consistently.\n\nThe International Federation of the Phonographic Industry credits this phenomenon to \"K-Pop fans who want high-quality physical formats and deluxe box sets\".\n\nAccording to a music executive from Universal Music Group, CDs are becoming \"the new merchandise in Asia\".\n\nSeveral controversies have arrived based on the way the industry has been treating its artists.\n\nIt is not uncommon for record labels to prohibit their pop artists from dating for a certain period of time or for as long as they have a contract with the company. In Japan managers may attempt to discourage their artists from dating or engaging in behavior that may tarnish their images by keeping a busy schedule and only letting artists know about their schedules a day at a time. Artists who break this contract, as in the case of Minami Minegishi from AKB48, run the risk of getting dropped from their music group or contract.\n\nKorea has similar rules for musical pop artists. Artists have more freedom to date and get married, however managers have strong control over their personal lives and behaviors. In Taiwan, artists are also expected to behave in certain ways, as they cannot discuss taboo topics such as politics.\n\nThe following table lists the total revenues of the music markets of East Asia:\n\nNotes\n\n<li> Music of Asia\n"}
{"id": "5396848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5396848", "title": "Mythos (film)", "text": "Mythos (film)\n\nMythos is a three-part documentary that consists of a series of lectures given by Joseph Campbell. Campbell conceived of the original lectures, filmed over the last six years of his life, as a summation of what he had learned about the human mythic impulse, in terms of psychology, ethnology and comparative mythology—what he called \"the one great story of mankind.\"\n\nAfter Campbell's death and the posthumous celebrity brought by the airing in 1988 of \"The Power of Myth\", the filmmakers who had recorded the lectures quickly cobbled together a much-abridged, hastily edited series for PBS entitled \"Transformations of Myth Through Time\". An even-more-highly redacted version was briefly released under the title \"The World of Joseph Campbell\".\n\nCampbell's estate, represented by his widow Jean Erdman and, eventually, by the Joseph Campbell Foundation (JCF), asked that these versions, which were unlicensed and did not accurately represent Campbell's thoughts, be pulled from the market, and proposed the production of a twenty-hour television series in four parts that followed Campbell's original vision more closely: \"Mythos\".\n\nVolume One of \"Mythos\" was released in 1999. Volume Two was released in 2000. Both parts are narrated by Susan Sarandon.\n\nAfter these initial releases, the original distributor, Unipix, promptly went bankrupt, and production on the series halted.\n\nThe JCF re-released the first two volumes in 2007 and 2008 in conjunction with Acorn Media as part of the \"Collected Works of Joseph Campbell\" series and the third volume was released in 2011. The decision was eventually made that the planned fourth volume, dealing with James Joyce's novels, was to be released in 2013 as a separate product. This was motivated by the difficulties to make its contents fit with the overall format of \"Mythos\".\n\nThe three volumes of \"Mythos\" were released together as \"Mythos - The Complete Series\" in September 2012.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The theater also operates a training center with programs in improv comedy, sketch comedy and stand-up comedy. PHIT's most notable alumnus is stand-up comedian Kent Haines, who was the 2008 winner of the Philly's Phunniest contest at Helium Comedy Club and has appeared on public radio show The Sound of Young America and Season 4 of Comedy Central's program Live at Gotham. In addition to Haines, other comedians from Philadelphia who appeared on stage at PHIT have gone on to perform at major comedy venues in cities like New York and Los Angeles, founded their own theatre companies, and appeared in touring productions for The Second City.\n\nPHIT was founded as a nonprofit in October 2005 by Greg Maughan, with assistance from local improvisers Bobbi Block, Matt Holmes and Alexis Simpson. The original purpose of the theater was to offer improv comedy instruction for beginning to advanced students. Over time PHIT expanded its mission to include sketch comedy instruction, and became an important presenter and producer for all varieties of alternative comedy shows. Viewers of Philadelphia's local FOX affiliate, WTXF-TV, voted PHIT as the city's Best Comedy Club in their 2009 Hot List competition.\n\nPHIT hosts a variety of comedy shows every night of the week: improv, sketch, stand-up, and variety comedy shows, as well as occasional movie screenings. The theater produces weekly performances by ten improv comedy house teams (The Future, Big Baby, Hoffman, 1816, Fjord, Channel 77, Swan Year, Metropolis, PG-13, and Hackett Park), three sketch comedy house teams (The Flat Earth, Dog Mountain, and Goat Rodeo) as well as independent improv and sketch groups. Also on PHIT's regular schedule are several variety comedy shows (People of Interest, Theme Show, Gimmick Show, Videostew+Monologues), a Panel Comedy show (A Few Answers Short), a \"found comedy\" night (Guilty Pleasures), a sketch open mic called Sketch Up or Shut Up, and an open improv jam. PHIT also hosts Dynamite Series covering a wide variety of comedic disciplines (Dirty Laundry, Study Hall). PHIT has also presented shows by performing groups from New York's Upright Citizens Brigade Theater, Magnet Theater, and The Peoples Improv Theater; and individuals including Kevin Allison of MTV's The State, Susan Messing of Chicago's Annoyance Theater, Kevin McDonald of The Kids in the Hall, and Dave Hill. Every first Sunday of the month PHIT hosts an improvised show Story UP! for kids ages 5 and up.\n\nFrom March 2006 until January 2008, PHIT produced a monthly improv comedy show at Fergie's Pub in Philadelphia's Center City. From January 2007 until December 2013, the theater has hosted regular performances at The Shubin Theatre, in addition to producing additional shows at others venues. In 2009, the theater produced a weekend of shows collectively titled \"Philly Invades NYC\" at Under Saint Marks' in New York City.\n\nIn January 2014 PHIT opened its permanent home on Second Stage at the Adrienne Theater in Center City Philadelphia at 2030 Sansom Street. In 2016 PHIT expanded to occupy the Mainstage in the Adrienne Theater.\n\nPHIT has participated in the Philadelphia Live Arts and Philly Fringe Festival every year since 2006. In 2008, the theater programmed performances by improv and sketch comedy groups on all 16 days of the festival, anchoring these shows around an original improv-to-script musical comedy titled \"The Hoppers Hit the Road\". The production garnered considerable attention and positive reviews in mainstream local media, including a review by The Philadelphia Inquirer. During the 2009 festival, the theater presented an ambitious schedule of performances - this time in the Fringe Festival's newly created Improv/Comedy category.\n\nSince its inception, the theater has offered a core curriculum of classes teaching basic to advanced improvising techniques. PHIT's curriculum is based heavily on similar programs at Chicago's Second City Training Center and iO (formerly ImprovOlympic), and New York's Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre. In February 2009, PHIT introduced a similar core curriculum in sketch comedy writing. PHIT uses local performers as instructors for its improv core curriculum, and a mix of local and nationally recognized teachers (including Kevin Allison of MTV's The State and former Saturday Night Live writer Ali Farahnakian) for its sketch comedy program. In 2015 PHIT launched its Kids & Teens program offering classes to kids in grades K-12.\n\n\n"}

She is portrayed by Tawny Cypress.\n\nWhen Simone Deveaux is introduced in the premiere episode, she is an art dealer living in New York City who is romantically involved with artist Isaac Mendez. However, she becomes increasingly distressed with Isaac's heroin addiction and his claims that he can paint the future.\n\nIn the episode \"One Giant Leap\", Simone takes down a painting of Claire and Zach and tells Isaac that she is selling the paintings so that he can go to rehab. When Isaac refuses, she leaves him. Later that day, Peter Petrelli, who until recently had been a hospice nurse caring for Simone's father, confesses his love for her. Although the two spend the night together, Simone doesn't want to rush into a new relationship.\n\nSeveral days later, Simone tells Peter that her father has died. When Peter inquires about the painting by Isaac which she sold recently, Simone tells him Mr. Linderman bought it.\n\nAfter Peter's brother Nathan retrieves the painting, he and Simone view it together. Nathan destroys the painting, which angers Simone. However, she is able to show Peter a digital replica and the image depicted seems to be a dead man resembling Peter. Nevertheless, Peter decides to go to the Union Wells high school homecoming shown in the picture. Simone is gradually starting to believe that Isaac can paint the future, and hopes Peter will come back alive.\n\nIn the episode \"Fallout\", Peter has a vision in which he sees all of the series' main characters in New York, seemingly running away from him. Among them is Simone, who runs towards him, only to be stopped by Isaac and dragged away.\n\nTwo weeks later, in \"Godsend\", Simone visits Peter, who has been comatose for the whole time, in the hospital. She later returns with Nathan to Isaac's loft, where she is greeted by a reformed Isaac. He states that he was in a clinic and can now paint without using heroin, and tells Simone he still loves her. Suddenly, Isaac's new friends Hiro Nakamura and Ando Masahashi arrive. After introductions, Hiro mentions that the Linderman Group has a sword he wants. Simone states that Linderman is an avid art collector, and recommends Hiro take a painting with him to see Linderman in Las Vegas.\n\nDuring the events of \"Distractions\", Simone goes to Isaac for help in locating Peter Petrelli. After the two talk, Isaac tells her to keep the key to his apartment. Later, in the same episode, Simone meets with Isaac on the roof of her departed father's building and they discuss the future before going to dinner together.\n\nIn the episode \"Unexpected\", Simone visits Isaac, but the painter tells her that he thinks Peter might have left New York (though he is in fact aware that he is still somewhere in the city). She doesn't believe him, and thinks that he is trying to drive a wedge into her and Peter's relationship out of jealousy. Isaac reasons that he is trying to protect her from Peter, for he is too dangerous. Simone then attempts to give Isaac his key back, but again he refuses, and says that he will do anything for her. Simone only wants for him to find Peter.\n\nLater, Simone confronts Nathan, telling him to reveal Peter's condition as well as the powers of others, in order to get help. However, Nathan refuses, afraid of being considered a freak and taken in for testing and probably lose the elections. Seeing Nathan is not going to budge, Simone leaves, remarking that she's \"voting for the other guy\". Nathan warns her not to say anything, but she doesn't respond.\n\nSimone returns to the apartment again, but she is accidentally shot in the chest by Isaac, who had been trying to shoot down the invisible Peter. Peter then reappears and she collapses in his arms. As she dies, her hand opens up to reveal Isaac's key.\n\nIn \"Parasite\", Candice Wilmer uses her illusion ability to transform into Simone and taunt Isaac.\n\nIn the first season's finale, \"How to Stop an Exploding Man\", Simone returns in a flashback role. After Peter blacks out in an empty street, he has a dream of the past, awakening on the Deveaux building's rooftop. Peter witnesses a past conversation he had with Simone, and another between Charles Deveaux and his mother. It is revealed that not only do Mrs. Petrelli and Mr. Deveaux know about the main characters' powers, but also about the bomb.\n\nIn the graphic novel \"From the Files of Primatech: 1991\", Dr. Jonas Zimmerman brings Simone along with Barbara (Niki and Tracy's triplet) to his father Charles at the Primatech headquarters. Simone then leaves with Charles and Barbara.\n\nIsaac's love interest was originally written as a bohemian white woman named Stella. However, after Ali Larter, not Cypress, was awarded the role of Niki Sanders, \"Heroes\" creator Tim Kring offered the role of Stella to her. The character was changed from a bohemian to an art dealer, and the name was changed to Simone Deveaux. The writers had discussed several storyline possibilities for Simone such as pregnancy and becoming another \"Horn Rimmed Glasses\" (Noah Bennet). Cypress believed Simone to be \"the Lois Lane of the Heroes world.\" In the end, however, the creative staff could not decide what direction to take Simone. \"Heroes\" creator Tim Kring informed her of Simone's fate in December 2006.\n"}

It is held in a private collection.\n\nThe painting depicts the recognisable view of Saint-Paul-de-Vence, one of the oldest medieval towns on the French Riviera, dominated by the church at its top. The work is particularly rich in color and has a very balanced composition. The blue sky above the town contains a large, bright yellow sun as well as various other elements from the artist’s iconography – animals, musicians and the flying couple. By juxtaposing this imagery, Soleil dans le ciel de Saint-Paul combines Chagall’s love of his Mediterranean home with his characteristic dream-like pictorial vision. With its free-flowing style and bright, translucent colours, the work exemplifies the effect that the south of France had on Chagall’s art. ‘The Southern French landscape has astonished Chagall with its wealth of colours and its lyrical atmosphere, had captivated him with the beauty of its flowers and foliage. These impressions found their way into his paintings of that period, refined their peinture and lent them a hitherto unknown radiance’.\n\nWith its fantastical, dream-like composition, the painting becomes an expression of the artist’s internal feelings and souvenirs rather than an objective projection of the outside world and of the familiar landscape. As such, Chagall’s paintings defy symbolic meaning and categorisation. In particular, his dreamscapes resist interpretation despite the ubiquity of repeated pictorial symbols; through repetition they become both familiar and meaningless, manifestations of a rich and colourful imagination that can be understood not through intellect but through intuition. As the artist himself proclaimed: ‘For me a picture is a surface covered with representations of things (objects, animals, human beings) in a certain order in which logic and illustration have no importance. The visual effect of the composition is what is paramount’.\n\nThe painting served as inspiration for an ensemble from the Valentino Haute Couture Spring/Summer 2015 Show. Chagall's Russian ancestry provided a leitmotif for the embellishments that are central to the designer's aesthetic.\n\n"}

{"id": "6793432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6793432", "title": "Summerwind", "text": "Summerwind\n\nSummerwind, formerly known as Lamont Mansion, is a ruined mansion on the shores of West Bay Lake in Vilas County, Wisconsin. Located on private land, its ruins are closed to the public. A number of urban legends and ghost stories in popular culture have contributed to its reputation as a haunted house.\n\nAccording to popular accounts, Summerwind was built in the early 20th century as a fishing lodge on the edge of West Bay Lake in Vilas County, in northeastern Wisconsin, and in 1916, purchased by Robert Patterson Lamont. According to some stories circulated, Lamont employed Chicago architects for the remodeling. Some versions of the story name the architects as Tallmadge and Watson. Supposedly the renovations took two years to complete.\n\nLegends include claims that Lamont fired a pistol at a ghost one night and was so frightened that he and his family abandoned the house. Other legends include claims that subsequent owners Arnold and Ginger Hinshaw were so disturbed by hauntings that Arnold suffered a \"nervous breakdown\" and Ginger attempted suicide.\n\nAlthough most Land O' Lakes natives refer to the property as Lamont's mansion, supernatural tales first disseminated by Ginger Hinshaw's father Raymond Bober claim the mansion was haunted and refer to it as \"Summerwind\". Some versions of the story claim that Bober purchased the property only to abandon it because the mansion's rooms had the supernatural power to change shape and dimensions at will. In 1979, Bober (writing under the pen name \"Wolfgang Von Bober\"), authored a book called \"The Carver Effect: A Paranormal Experience\" in which he claimed the mansion was haunted by 18th century explorer Jonathan Carver. According to Bober's narrative, the property was often unoccupied due to alleged supernatural activity and the Hinshaws could not get workers to enter the home to do remodeling work. However according to one of Bober's neighbors, Bober did not live in the mansion, never spent the night in it and instead lived in a trailer on the property. At least two previous residents reportedly denied claims that the house was haunted and locals claimed the haunting stories did not begin until Bober's book was published. A 1980 Life magazine photo essay including Summerwind among \"Terrifying Tales of Nine Haunted Houses\" apparently spread the supernatural tales originated in Bober's book. According to author Marv Balousek, locals never believed the home was haunted and were dismayed when the home became somewhat of a supernatural tourist attraction.\n\nIn 1985, officials for the Town of Land O' Lakes made an attempt to demolish the vacant home. The Vilas County Sheriff said it was a staging area for local teens who burglarized or vandalized nearby cottages. This attempt failed, but the abandoned mansion was later destroyed by fire following a lightning strike on June 19, 1988. Later that week, fire officials reported that the fire was not suspicious and arson was not suspected since neighbors reported being awakened when lightning struck the vacant home. However, fire officials also said that teenagers frequently used the location for parties and that they may have left a fire burning.\n\nIn 2014, owners Harold and Babs Tracy and the Fox Valley Ghost Hunters sought funding to rebuild the mansion as a bed and breakfast.\n\nIn October 2005, Summerwind was featured on a Discovery Channel episode of \"A Haunting.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7699498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7699498", "title": "Swedish realism", "text": "Swedish realism\n\nSwedish realism is the period in Swedish literature that encompassed the last two decades of the 19th century. It is generally considered to have ended in the 1910s but the exact year is a matter of debate.\n\nAugust Strindberg (1849-1912) was a writer world-famous for his dramas and prose, noted for his exceptional talent and complex intellect. In 1879 he published \"The Red Room\" (\"Röda Rummet\"), which brought him immediate fame. \"The Red Room\" was a satirical novel that relentlessly attacked the political, the academic, the philosophical and the religious worlds.\n\nAfter several harsh disputes, Strindberg left Sweden in 1883. In 1884, he briefly returned to Stockholm to stand trial in a blasphemy case against his collection of short stories \"Married\" (\"Giftas\"). He was acquitted, but the trial sparked a psychological turmoil that lasted for some 10 years, during which he wrote some of his internationally best known works: the self-examinatory \"Tjänstekvinnans son\" (1886–87), \"En dåres försvarstal\" (1887-87); and also plays \"Fadren\", \"Fröken Julie\" and \"Mäster Olof\" (1886–88).\n\nIn 1897 Strindberg engaged himself in occultism, in particular alchemy, leading to a mental breakdown known as his Inferno-crisis. The following year (1897), Strindberg moved back to Sweden and settled in the city Lund. There, he resurrected his literary production by publishing \"Inferno\".\n\nIn 1898, Strindberg moved back to Stockholm. He continued writing but also engaged himself energetically in debates in a wide range of subjects. His most notable writings during this period were his dramas, such as \"The Dance of Death\" (1900) and \"A Dream Play\" (1901).\n\nThe Swedish 1890s is noted for its poetic neo-romanticism, a reaction to the socio-realistic literature of the 1880s. The first literary key figure to emerge was Verner von Heidenstam (1859-1940), and his literary debut in 1887 with the collection of poetry \"Vallfart och vandringsår\" (Pilgrimage and Wander-Years).\nSelma Lagerlöf (1858-1940) was the arguably brightest star of the 1890s, and her impression has lasted up to modern times. She wrote several highly regarded works which are still among the toplists on Swedish libraries, such as \"Gösta Berlings saga\" (1891), an epic tale of the unmoral Gösta Berling who gets haunted by the Devil, and \"The Wonderful Adventures of Nils\" (1906-1907), a geographical adventure of Nils who travels Sweden on the back of a goose. Lagerlöf was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1909 for the imagination and spiritual perception that characterized her writings.\n\nGustaf Fröding (1860-1911) was another key figure of the 1890s. His active literary period only spanned between 1891–1898, because of mental problems. Fröding was above all renowned for his flowing poetry. His popularity was at first based on his bubbling sense of humor and free treatment of the poetic verse; but later readers also found in it a profound humanism and imaginative depth.\n\nErik Axel Karlfeldt (1864-1931) was, like Fröding, a depictor of rural life in his native province (in Karlfeldt's case, Dalarna). His poetry had the intention of sparking a cultural identity within Dalarna, and spoke warmly of traditions, family values, and so on. Although his poetry was narrow, Karlfeldt was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1931 (posthumously), possibly as a result of internal politics within the Swedish Academy.\n\n"}
{"id": "477751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=477751", "title": "The Glass Bead Game", "text": "The Glass Bead Game\n\nThe Glass Bead Game () is the last full-length novel of the German author Hermann Hesse. It was begun in 1931 and published in Switzerland in 1943 after being rejected for publication in Germany due to Hesse's anti-Fascist views. A few years later, in 1946, Hesse went on to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. In honoring him in its Award Ceremony Speech, the Swedish Academy said that the novel \"occupies a special position\" in Hesse's work.\n\n\"Glass Bead Game\" is a literal translation of the German title, but the book has also been published under the title Magister Ludi, Latin for \"Master of the Game\", which is an honorific title awarded to the book's central character. \"Magister Ludi\" can also be seen as a pun: \"lud-\" is a Latin stem meaning both \"game\" and \"school\". However, the title Magister Ludi is misleading, as it implies the book is a straightforward bildungsroman. In reality, the book touches on many different genres, and the bulk of the story is on one level a parody of the biography genre.\n\n\"The Glass Bead Game\" takes place at an unspecified date centuries into the future. Hesse suggested that he imagined the book's narrator writing around the start of the 25th century. The setting is a fictional province of central Europe called Castalia, which was reserved by political decision for the life of the mind; technology and economic life are kept to a strict minimum. Castalia is home to an austere order of intellectuals with a twofold mission: to run boarding schools for boys, and to cultivate and play the Glass Bead Game, whose exact nature remains elusive and whose devotees occupy a special school within Castalia known as Waldzell. The rules of the game are only alluded to—they are so sophisticated that they are not easy to imagine. Playing the game well requires years of hard study of music, mathematics, and cultural history. The game is essentially an abstract synthesis of all arts and sciences. It proceeds by players making deep connections between seemingly unrelated topics.\n\nThe novel is an example of a bildungsroman, following the life of a distinguished member of the Castalian Order, Joseph Knecht, whose surname means \"servant\" (and is cognate with the English word \"knight\"). The plot chronicles Knecht's education as a youth, his decision to join the order, his mastery of the Game, and his advancement in the order's hierarchy to eventually become \"Magister Ludi\", the executive officer of the Castalian Order's game administrators. \n\nThe beginning of the novel introduces the Music Master, the resident of Castalia who recruits Knecht as a young student and who is to have the most long-lasting and profound effect on Knecht throughout his life. At one point, as the Music Master nears death in his home at Monteport, Knecht obliquely refers to the Master's \"sainthood\". As a student, another meaningful friendship develops with Plinio Designori, a student from a politically influential family, who is studying in Castalia as a guest. Knecht develops many of his personal views about what larger good Castalia can achieve through vigorous debates with Designori, who views Castalia as an \"ivory tower\" with little to no impact on the outside world.\n\nAlthough educated within Castalia, Knecht's path to \"Magister Ludi\" is atypical for the order, as he spends a significant portion of his time after graduation outside the boundaries of the province. His first such venture, to the Bamboo Grove, results in his learning Chinese and becoming something of a disciple to Elder Brother, a recluse who had given up living within Castalia. Next, as part of an assignment to foster goodwill between the order and the Catholic Church, Knecht is sent on several \"missions\" to the Benedictine monastery of Mariafels, where he befriends the historian Father Jacobus – a relationship which also has profound personal impact for Knecht.\n\nAs the novel progresses, Knecht begins to question his loyalty to the order, gradually coming to doubt that the intellectually gifted have a right to withdraw from life's big problems. Knecht, too, comes to see Castalia as a kind of ivory tower, an ethereal and protected community, devoted to pure intellectual pursuits but oblivious to the problems posed by life outside its borders. This conclusion precipitates a personal crisis, and, according to his personal views regarding spiritual awakening, Knecht does the unthinkable: he resigns as Magister Ludi and asks to leave the order, ostensibly to become of value and service to the larger culture. The heads of the order deny his request to leave, but Knecht departs Castalia anyway, initially taking a job as a tutor to his childhood friend Designori's energetic and strong-willed son, Tito. Only a few days later, the story ends abruptly with Knecht drowning in a mountain lake while attempting to follow Tito on a swim for which Knecht was unfit.\n\nThe fictional narrator leaves off before the final sections of the book, remarking that the end of the story is beyond the scope of his biography. The concluding chapter, entitled \"The Legend\", is reportedly from a different biography. After this final chapter, several of Knecht's \"posthumous\" works are then presented. The first section contains Knecht's poetry from various periods of his life, followed by three short stories labeled \"Three Lives\". The stories are presented as exercises by Knecht imagining his life had he been born in another time and place. The first story tells of a pagan rainmaker named Knecht who lived \"many thousands of years ago, when women ruled\". Eventually the shaman's powers to summon rain fail, and he offers himself as a sacrifice for the good of the tribe. The second story is based on the life of St Hilarion and tells of Josephus, an early Christian hermit who acquires a reputation for piety but is inwardly troubled by self-loathing and seeks a confessor, only to find that same penitent had been seeking him.\n\nThe final story concerns the life of Dasa, a prince wrongfully usurped by his half brother as heir to a kingdom and disguised as a cowherd to save his life. While working with the herdsmen as a young boy, Dasa encounters a yogi in meditation in the forest. He wishes to experience the same tranquility as the yogi, but is unable to stay. He later leaves the herdsmen and marries a beautiful young woman, only to be cuckolded by his half brother (now the Rajah). In a cold fury, he kills his half brother and finds himself once again in the forest with the old yogi, who, through an experience of an alternate life, guides him on the spiritual path and out of the world of illusion (Maya).\n\nThe three lives, together with that as Magister Ludi, oscillate between extroversion (rainmaker, Indian life – both get married) and introversion (father confessor, Magister Ludi) while developing the four basic psychic functions of analytical psychology: sensation (rainmaker), intuition (Indian life), feeling (father confessor), and thinking (Magister Ludi).\n\nOriginally, Hesse intended several different lives of the same person as he is reincarnated. Instead, he focused on a story set in the future and placed the three shorter stories, \"authored\" by Knecht in \"The Glass Bead Game\", at the end of the novel.\n\nTwo drafts of a fourth life were published in 1965, the second version being recast in the first person and breaking off earlier. Dated 1934, they describe Knecht's childhood and education as a Swabian theologian. This Knecht has been born some dozen years after the Treaty of Rijswijk in the time of Eberhard Ludwig, and in depicting the other characters Hesse draws heavily on actual biographies: Friedrich Christoph Oetinger, Johann Friedrich Rock, Johann Albrecht Bengel and Nicolaus Zinzendorf make up the cast of Pietist mentors. Knecht is heavily drawn to music however, both that of the acknowledged master Pachelbel and the more exotic Buxtehude. The fragment breaks off as the young contemporary of Bach happens upon an organ recital in Stuttgart.\n\n\nThe Glass Bead Game is \"a kind of synthesis of human learning\" in which themes, such as a musical phrase or a philosophical thought, are stated. As the Game progresses, associations between the themes become deeper and more varied. Although the Glass Bead Game is described lucidly, the rules and mechanics are not explained in detail.\n\nMany characters in the novel have names that are allusive word games. For example, Knecht's predecessor as Magister Ludi was Thomas van der Trave, a veiled reference to Thomas Mann, who was born in Lübeck, situated on the Trave River. Knecht's brilliant but unstable friend Fritz Tegularius is based on Friedrich Nietzsche, while Father Jacobus is based on the historian Jakob Burckhardt. The name of Carlo Ferromonte is an italianized version of the name of Hesse's nephew, Karl Isenberg, while the name of the Glass Bead Game's inventor, Bastian Perrot of Calw, was taken from Heinrich Perrot, who owned a machine shop where Hesse once worked after dropping out of school. The name of the pedagogic province in the story is taken from Greek legend of the nymph Castalia, who was transformed into an inspiration-granting fountain by the god Apollo.\n\nFreedman wrote in his biography of Hesse that the tensions caused by the rise of the Nazi Party in Germany directly contributed to the creation of the \"Glass Bead Game\" as a response to the oppressive times. \"The educational province of Castalia, which provided a setting for the novel, came to resemble Hesse's childhood Swabia physically while assuming more and more the function of his adopted home, neutral Switzerland, which in turn embodied his own antidote to the crises of his time. It became the \"island of love\" or at least an island of the spirit.\" Freedman opined that in the Glass Bead Game \"contemplation, the secrets of the Chinese I Ching and Western mathematics and music fashioned the perennial conflicts of his life into a unifying design.\"\n\nIn 2010, \"The Glass Bead Game\" was dramatised by Lavinia Greenlaw for BBC Radio 4. It starred Derek Jacobi as the Biographer, Tom Ferguson as Knecht and David Seddon as Plinio.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

It is the second part of the \"Condor Trilogy\" and was preceded by \"The Legend of the Condor Heroes\" and followed by \"The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber\". It was first serialised between 20 May 1959 and 5 July 1961 in the Hong Kong newspaper \"Ming Pao\".\n\nThe story revolves around the protagonist, Yang Guo, and his lover and martial arts master, Xiaolongnü, in their adventures in the \"jianghu\" (also called the \"wulin\", the community of martial artists), where love between master and apprentice is seen as taboo. Jin Yong revised the novel in 1970 and again in 2004. There are 40 chapters in the second and third revisions. Each chapter has a title composed of four Chinese characters. Most of the revisions are either clarifications or minor alterations of character motivations or names. The Chinese title of the novel translates to \"The Divine Eagle and the Heroic Couple\".\n\nThe protagonist, Yang Guo, is the orphaned son of Yang Kang, one of the antagonists in \"The Legend of the Condor Heroes\", who is also the sworn brother of Guo Jing. The couple Guo Jing and Huang Rong take care of Yang Guo for a short period of time before sending him to the Quanzhen Sect on Mount Zhongnan for better guidance in moral values and orthodox martial arts. In Quanzhen, Yang Guo is often picked on and bullied by his fellow students, and discriminated against by his master, Zhao Zhijing. Yang Guo flees from Quanzhen and ventures unknowingly into the nearby Tomb of the Living Dead, where the Ancient Tomb Sect is based. There, he meets Xiaolongnü, a mysterious maiden of unknown origin, and becomes her apprentice. They live together in the tomb for many years until Yang Guo grows up.\n\nYang Guo and Xiaolongnü develop romantic feelings for each other, but their romance is forbidden by the prevailing norms of the \"jianghu\" (or \"wulin\", the community of martial artists). Throughout the story, their love meets with several tests, such as the misunderstandings that threaten to tear them apart, and their encounter with Gongsun Zhi, whom Xiaolongnü almost marries at one point. Finally, after their reunion and marriage, Xiaolongnü leaves Yang Guo again, owing to her belief she cannot recover from a fatal poison and promises to meet him again 16 years later, to prevent him from committing suicide.

At first, they were popular polls and contests conducted in film magazines, where the readers would vote for their favorite stars, like the poll published in New York Morning Telegraph on 17 December 1911. Magazines appeared and disappeared often and among the most consistent in those early days were to polls in the Motion Picture Magazine.\n\nThough this and numerous other magazines, like Photoplay, continued with this type of polls, the standards for the polling were set by the Quigley Publishing Company. They published a poll, which became known as the \"Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll\", from a questionnaire given to movie exhibitors every year between 1915 and 2013 by Quigley Publishing Company.\n\nThe list was based on a poll of movie theater owners, who were asked to name who they felt were the previous year's top 10 moneymaking stars. The Top 10 Poll, which appeared annually in Quigley's \"Motion Picture Herald\" and \"The Motion Picture Almanac\", was long regarded as one of the most reliable barometers of a movie star's box-office power, as film exhibitors base their decisions on one economic criterion: those stars who will bring patrons into their theaters.\n\nIn addition to the top ten stars for that year, the Quigley Poll would commonly list the next 15 stars as well. A sample of these are below:\n \n\nFor a number of years, there was also a poll for the top ten Western stars in the United States. \n\nThe \"Motion Picture Herald\" published a similar list for the UK, listing the most popular stars at the British box office, including the most popular British stars.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Another poll by Sidney L. Bernstein of his theatre group listed these actors.\n\nVarious polls have been taken for the top stars in France too.\nIn 1938 a list was published of stars who were considered \"box office poison\" by exhibitors. The list was from Harry Brandt of the Independent Theater Owners Association.\n\nThe stars included:\n\nIn 1968 \"Variety\" magazine published a list of ten stars it considered overpriced.

Bitumba were created in Zaire and Angola during the nineteenth century and the first part of the twentieth. The term tumba comes from the old Portuguese word for “tomb”— this genre may have been inspired by grave monuments for European merchants and missionaries in Kongo cemeteries.\n\nBituma were executed in soft stone. Their average height it close to 50 centimeters; the smallest bituma measure between 15 and 20 centimeters and the largest are approximately a meter in height.\n\nArtist Robert Verly gathered a large number of statues in the north of Angola near the Zaire border and, in the May 1955 issue of Zaire, he classified the objects by type and proposed an explanation for their use. In July 1978, the Institut des Musees Nationaux du Zaire at the Center for International Commerce of Zaire in Kinshasa mounted an exhibition of 72 bitumba called \"Sculptures Stones from Lower Zaire.\"\n\nBitumba sculptures are unique in their variety of styles. Robert Farris Thompson has identified about twenty workshops that explain stylistic individuality. The wide dispersal of the works, however, has made it impossible to localize their centers of production. \n\nBitumba are express a variety of themes. The most widely found - about twenty percent of statues belong to this type - is a figure who raises his hands in front of his face in a gesture often interpreted as praying. The second most prevalent theme is that of mother and child. The art of Lower Zaire, and especially the art of Mayombe, is known for privileging maternity subjects. The third theme is that of the \"thinker,\" who holds on hand on the hip and the other pressed to check in an attitude of meditation.\n"}
{"id": "1034781", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1034781", "title": "Vulgarity", "text": "Vulgarity\n\nVulgarity is the quality of being common, coarse, or unrefined. This judgement may refer to language, visual art, social classes, or social climbers. John Bayley claims it can never be self-referential because, to be aware of vulgarity is to display a degree of sophistication which thereby elevates the subject above the vulgar.\n\nFrom the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries, \"vulgar\" simply described the common language or vernacular of a country. From the mid-seventeenth century onward, it began to take on a pejorative aspect: \"having a common and offensively mean character, coarsely commonplace; lacking in refinement or good taste; uncultured; ill bred\". In the Victorian age, vulgarity broadly described many sorts of activity, such as wearing ostentatious clothing, and other similarly subtle aspects of behavior. In a George Eliot novel, one character could be vulgar for talking about money, a second because he criticizes the first for doing so, and a third for being fooled by the excessive refinement of the second.\n\nIn language, the effort to avoid vulgarity could leave characters at a loss for words. In George Meredith's \"Beauchamp's Career\", an heiress does not wish to make the commonplace statement that she is \"engaged\", nor \"betrothed\", \"affianced\", or \"plighted\". Though such words are not vulgarity in the vulgar sense, they nonetheless could stigmatize the user as a member of a socially inferior class. Even favored euphemisms such as \"toilet\" eventually become stigmatized like the words they replace, and currently favored words serve as a sort of \"cultural capital\".\n\nVulgarity, or vulgar speech or language, can refer to language which is offensive or obscene, synonymous with the 'general' meaning of profanity.\n\nThe word most associated with the verbal form of vulgarity is \"cursing.\" However, there are many subsections of vulgar words. In the book, \"Cursing in America\" by Timothy Jay, Jay makes a classification of the \"dirty words\" because it \"allows people interested in language to define the different types of reference or meaning that dirty words employ. One can see that what is considered taboo or obscene revolves around a few dimensions of human experience that there is a logic behind dirty word usage.\" One of the most commonly used vulgar terms in the English language is \"fuck\".\n\nCurse words, or cursing, have been recognized by religious organizations as being able to cause actual mental and physical harm. More recently such words have separated themselves from their religious meanings, and it is doubtful that those who use curse words imagine the words will bring actual mental or physical harm. Both parties are aware that the cursing is simply an expression, and the ones receiving the curse words or phrase are aware they are being targeted.\n\nReligious curses may include \"Damn you\", \"God damn you\", \"To hell with you\". Cursing also includes non-religious expressions, like \"Fuck you\" or \"Eat shit and die\".\n\nProfanity are words that are considered hateful or contemptuous, especially in regard to religion. \n\nFor a word or phrase to be profane it must not be religious or function outside the duties of religious belief. To be profane means for the word or phrase to be ignorant or hateful towards the rules of religions. Examples of profanity are words or a phrase not meant to belittle Gods, their religions, but situated on the ignorance and indifference to such points.\n"}
