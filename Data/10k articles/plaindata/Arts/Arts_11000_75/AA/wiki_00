{"id": "363992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=363992", "title": "1950s in film", "text": "1950s in film\n\nThe decade of the 1950s in film involved many significant films.\n\nFilms of the 1950s were of a wide variety. As a result of the introduction of television, the studios and companies sought to put audiences back in theaters. They used more techniques in presenting their films through widescreen and big-approach methods, such as Cinemascope, VistaVision, and Cinerama, as well as gimmicks like 3-D film. Big production and spectacle films perfect for this gained popularity, with the many historic and fantasy epics like \"The Robe\" (1953),\"The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men\" (1952), \"The Ten Commandments\" (1956), \"The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad\" (1958), and \"Ben-Hur\" (1959). Other big-scoped films thrived internationally, too, such as Russian fantasy director Aleksandr Ptushko's mythological epics \"Sadko\", \"Ilya Muromets\", and \"Sampo\", and Japanese director Akira Kurosawa's historic \"Seven Samurai\", \"Throne of Blood\", and \"Rashomon\". Toshiro Mifune, who starred in those Kurosawa films, also starred in the color spectacle \"Samurai Trilogy\".\n\nThis spectacle approach, coupled with Cold War paranoia, a renewed interest in science from the atomic bomb, as well as increased interest in the mysteries of outer space and other forteana, lent itself well to what this film decade is best known for, science fiction. The science fiction genre began its golden age during this decade with such notable films as \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" (1951), \"The Thing from Another World\" (1951), \"The War of the Worlds\" (1953), \"It Came from Outer Space\" (1953), \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\" (1954), \"Them!\" (1954), \"This Island Earth\" (1955), \"Earth vs. the Flying Saucers\" (1956), and \"Forbidden Planet\" (1956). There were also Earth-based \"sci-fi\" subjects, such as \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\" (1954) and \"When Worlds Collide\" (1951). Companies such as American International Pictures, Japan's Toho, and Britain's Hammer Film Productions were created to solely produce films of the fantastique genres.\n\nThe decade was equally adept at both character and realistic films. The highly noted actors James Stewart, John Wayne, and Marlon Brando were at the peak of their popularity. Stewart, starring in \"Winchester '73\", and Wayne, starring in John Ford's Cavalry Trilogy and \"The Searchers\", revitalized the western. Brando mastered versatile roles in films such as \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", \"The Wild One\" (1953), \"Julius Caesar\", \"On the Waterfront\" (1954), \"Guys and Dolls\" (1955), \"The Teahouse of the August Moon\" (1956), and \"Sayonara\" (1957).\n\nDirector Alfred Hitchcock was at the peak of his craft, with films such as \"Strangers on a Train\" (1951), \"Dial M for Murder\" (1954), \"Rear Window\" (1954), \"To Catch a Thief\" (1955), \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" (1956), \"Vertigo\" (1958), and \"North by Northwest\" (1959), with James Stewart and Grace Kelly starring in three each. The Bengali Indian director Satyajit Ray, who began his career in the 1950s, was also at the peak of his career during this decade, with films such as \"The Apu Trilogy\" (1955–1959), \"Jalsaghar\" (1958), and \"Parash Pathar\" (1958).\n\n"}

{"id": "1335047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1335047", "title": "Aerial perspective", "text": "Aerial perspective\n\nAerial perspective or atmospheric perspective refers to the effect the atmosphere has on the appearance of an object as it is viewed from a distance. As the distance between an object and a viewer increases, the contrast between the object and its background decreases, and the contrast of any markings or details within the object also decreases. The colours of the object also become less saturated and shift towards the background colour, which is usually blue, but under some conditions may be some other colour (for example, at sunrise or sunset distant colours may shift towards red).\n\nAerial perspective was used in paintings from the Netherlands in the 15th century, and explanations of its effects were with varying degrees of accuracy written by polymaths such as Leon Battista Alberti and Leonardo da Vinci. The latter used aerial perspective in many of his paintings such as the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper. Atmospheric perspective was used in Pompeian Second Style paintings, one of the Pompeian Styles, dating as early as 30 BCE. A notable example is the Gardenscape from the Villa of Livia in Primaporta, Italy.\n\nThe major component affecting the appearance of objects during daylight is scattering of light, called skylight, into the line of sight of the viewer. Scattering occurs from molecules of the air and also from larger particles in the atmosphere such as water vapour and smoke (see haze). Scattering adds the sky light as a veiling luminance onto the light from the object, reducing its contrast with the background sky light. Skylight usually contains more light of short wavelength than other wavelengths (this is why the sky usually appears blue), which is why distant objects appear bluish (see Rayleigh scattering for detailed explanation). A minor component is scattering of light out of the line of sight of the viewer. Under daylight, this either augments the contrast loss (e.g., for white objects) or opposes it (for dark objects). At night there is effectively no skylight (unless the moon is very bright), so scattering out of the line of sight becomes the major component affecting the appearance of self-luminous objects. Such objects have their contrasts reduced with the dark background, and their colours are shifted towards red.\n\nThe ability of a person with normal visual acuity to see fine details is determined by his or her contrast sensitivity. Contrast sensitivity is the reciprocal of the smallest contrast for which a person can see a sine-wave grating. A person's contrast sensitivity function is contrast sensitivity as a function of spatial frequency. Normally, peak contrast sensitivity is at about 4 cycles per degree of visual angle. At higher spatial frequencies, comprising finer and finer lines, contrast sensitivity decreases, until at about 40 cycles per degree even the brightest of bright lines and the darkest of dark lines cannot be seen.\n\nThe high spatial frequencies in an image give it its fine details. Reducing the contrast of an image reduces the visibility of these high spatial frequencies because contrast sensitivity for them is already poor. This is how a reduction of contrast can reduce the clarity of an image—by removing its fine details.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that reducing the contrast is not the same as blurring an image. Blurring is accomplished by reducing the contrast only of the high spatial frequencies. Aerial perspective reduces the contrast of all spatial frequencies.\n\nIn art, especially painting, \"aerial perspective\" refers to the technique of creating an illusion of depth by depicting distant objects as paler, less detailed, and usually bluer than near objects.\n\n"}
{"id": "177250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=177250", "title": "Aleatoricism", "text": "Aleatoricism\n\nAleatoricism is the incorporation of chance into the process of creation, especially the creation of art or media. The word derives from the Latin word \"alea\", the rolling of dice. \"Aleatory\" should not be confused with either improvisation or indeterminacy.\n\nCharles Hartman discusses several methods of automatic generation of poetry in his book \"The Virtual Muse\".\n\nThe term aleatory music was first coined by Werner Meyer-Eppler in 1955 to describe a course of sound events that is \"determined in general but depends on chance in detail\". When his article was published in English, the translator mistakenly rendered his German noun \"Aleatorik\" as an adjective, and so inadvertently created a new English word, \"aleatoric\". Pierre Boulez applied the term in this sense to his own pieces to distinguish them from the indeterminate music of John Cage. While Boulez purposefully composed his pieces to allow the performer certain liberties with regard to the sequencing and repetition of parts, Cage often composed through the application of chance operations without allowing the performer liberties. Another prolific composer of aleatory music was Karlheinz Stockhausen.\n\nAleatoric techniques are sometimes used in contemporary film music. Examples can be found in John Williams's scores as well as, for example, Mark Snow's music for \"X-Files: Fight the Future\".\n\nIn film-making, there are several avant-garde examples; one is Andy Voda's \"Chance Chants\" which features Allison Knowles' computer poem \"House of Dust\", \n\nFred Camper's \"SN\" (1984, first screening 2002) uses coin-flipping for one section to determine which three of 16 possible reels to screen and what order they should go in (3360 permutations).\n\nFilm scholar Barry Salt directed the 1971 film \"Six Reels of Film to Be Shown in Any Order\".\n\n\n"}

It is currently displayed at the Musee Rodin in Paris, France.\n\nVan Gogh was about 35 years of age when he moved to Arles in southern France. There he was at the height of his career, producing some of his best work. His paintings represented different aspects of ordinary life, such as \"Harvest at La Crau.\" The sunflower paintings, some of the most recognizable of Van Gogh's paintings, were created in this time. He worked continuously to keep up with his ideas for paintings. This was also likely one of Van Gogh's happier periods of life. He was confident, clear-minded and seemingly content.\n\nHis work during this period represents a culmination of influences, such as Impressionism, Neo-Impressionism and Japanese art (see Japonism) from his period in Paris the prior two years. His style evolved into one with vivid colors and energetic, impasto brush strokes.\n\nThe close association of peasants and the cycles of nature particularly interested Van Gogh, such as the sowing of seeds, harvest and sheaves of wheat in the fields. Van Gogh saw plowing, sowing and harvesting symbolic to man's efforts to overwhelm the cycles of nature: \"the sower and the wheat sheaf stood for eternity, and the reaper and his scythe for irrevocable death.\" The dark hours conducive to germination and regeneration are depicted in \"The Sower\" and wheat fields at sunset.\n\nIn 1889 Van Gogh wrote of the way in which wheat was symbolic to him: \"What can a person do when he thinks of all the things he cannot understand, but look at the fields of wheat... We, who live by bread, are we not ourselves very much like wheat... to be reaped when we are ripe.\"\n\nDuring the last half of June he worked on a group of ten \"Harvest\" paintings, which allowed him to experiment with color and technique. \"I have now spent a week working hard in the wheatfields, under the blazing sun,\" Van Gogh wrote on 21 June 1888 to his brother Theo. He described the series of wheat fields as \"…landscapes, yellow—old gold—done quickly, quickly, quickly, and in a hurry just like the harvester who is silent under the blazing sun, intent only on the reaping.\"\n\n\"Arles: View from the Wheat Fields\" represents the harvest. In the foreground are sheaves of harvested wheat leaning against one another. The center of the painting depicts the harvesting process, a couple at work in a sea of yellow and ochre. Across the horizon is the town of Arles. Van Gogh described the series of wheat fields as \"…landscapes, yellow—old gold—done quickly, quickly, quickly, and in a hurry just like the harvester who is silent under the blazing sun, intent only on the reaping.\" Van Gogh used landscape-format for all of his \"Wheat Fields\" paintings, the one exception was this painting which was made in portrait-format.\n"}

{"id": "2204009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2204009", "title": "Bach Gesellschaft", "text": "Bach Gesellschaft\n\nThe German Bach-Gesellschaft (Bach Society) was a society formed in 1850 for the express purpose of publishing the complete works of Johann Sebastian Bach without editorial additions. The collected works are known as the Bach-Gesellschaft-Ausgabe. On completion of the project, the Society dissolved itself.\n\nThe nineteenth-century society needs to be distinguished from its successor, the Neue Bachgesellschaft (New Bach Society), founded in 1900.\n\nThe founders of the society were Moritz Hauptmann, cantor of the St. Thomas Church, Leipzig, (and thus a successor of Bach); Otto Jahn, author of a noted biography of Mozart; Carl Ferdinand Becker, teacher at the Leipzig Conservatory; and the composer Robert Schumann.\n\nThe Bach-Gesellschaft began publishing Bach's works in 1851 with a volume that started with BWV 1, the cantata \"Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern, BWV 1\". It completed publication in 1900 with its forty-sixth volume. However, the edition of \"The Art of Fugue\" by Wolfgang Graeser, published in 1926, is sometimes counted as \"Volume 47\" and was issued as a supplement to the Bach-Gesellschaft publication by Breitkopf & Härtel, publishers of the original series. Additionally, Vol. 45, part 1 includes a revised edition (\"Neue berichtige Ausgabe\") of the English Suites and French Suites that had previously been published in Vol. 13.\n\nAmong the editors was Alfred Dörffel. Brahms was one of the subscribers to the project and also served on the editorial board. A list of subscribers was printed in each volume.\n\nThe volumes varied somewhat in editorial quality and accuracy; Bach scholar Hans T. David particularly criticized Vol. 31's presentation of \"The Musical Offering\" for numerous incorrect readings, and the 1911 \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" calls the edition as a whole \"of very unequal merit.\" \"Britannica\" both lauds the editing of Wilhelm Rust for the edition and notes a deterioration of standards after his death, including a volume in which \"the bass and violin are a bar apart for a whole line\" (apparently a reference to sloppy editing). In his edition of the \"Goldberg Variations,\" Ralph Kirkpatrick also calls attention to several \"mistakes of the Bachgesellschaft edition\" that he has corrected, particularly with regard to the presentation of ornaments. (It is worth noting that the Bach-Gesellschaft volume containing the \"Goldbergs\" was one of the first to be published—Vol. 3, which appeared in 1853.)\n\nNevertheless, the Bach-Gesellschaft's volumes were a groundbreaking achievement and contributed greatly to the study and appreciation of Bach's music. They remained the standard edition of Bach's complete works until the publication of the Neue Bach-Ausgabe by Bärenreiter and the Deutscher Verlag für Musik (1954-2007).\n\n"}

The film stars an ensemble cast that includes Mila Kunis, Christina Applegate, Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn, Jay Hernandez, Annie Mumolo, Jada Pinkett Smith, and J. J. Watt .\n\nPrincipal photography began on January 11, 2016, in New Orleans. The film premiered on July 19, 2016, in New York City and was theatrically released on July 29, 2016, by STXfilms. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed over $183 million worldwide, becoming the first film from STX to gross $100 million domestically.\n\nA sequel, titled \"A Bad Moms Christmas\", was released on November 1, 2017.\n\nAmy Mitchell (Mila Kunis) is a married woman in the Chicago suburbs with two children, Jane (Oona Laurence) and Dylan (Emjay Anthony), who feels overworked and overcommitted. She works as a sales rep for a \"hip\" coffee company, prepares healthful, hand-packed lunches for her children, does most of their homework, goes to all of their extracurricular activities, and is active in her school's PTA, run by the domineering Gwendolyn James (Christina Applegate) and her cronies, Stacy (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Vicky (Annie Mumolo). When she catches her husband Mike (David Walton) cheating on her with a camgirl, Amy kicks him out and attempts to keep everything together.\n\nAfter a particularly stressful day, Amy publicly quits the PTA in response to Gwendolyn's overzealous bake sale plans. At a nearby bar, Amy meets Carla (Kathryn Hahn), a laid-back, sexually active single mom, and Kiki (Kristen Bell), a stay-at-home mom of four who adores Amy's dissent from Gwendolyn. Amy and Carla are irritated to discover that Kiki's husband is domineering and expects her to take care of all the kids and the house with no assistance whatsoever, while Amy and Kiki are disturbed at Carla's very hands-off approach to parenting. The trio embark on an all-night bender that inspires Amy to loosen up with her kids: she takes them for rides in Mike's classic car, gets them lunch from Arby's, forces Dylan to fend for himself to prevent him from being lazy and entitled, and takes the overachieving and constantly stressed Jane for a spa day. Amy herself decides to start dating but finds herself inexperienced due to her early marriage and motherhood. She ultimately ends up striking a connection with Jessie (Jay Hernandez), a handsome widower at the school who's had a crush on her.\n\nAfter Amy brings store-bought donut holes to the bake sale, she draws the ire of Gwendolyn, who uses her PTA authority to get Jane benched from the soccer team. Amy is angered, and decides to run for PTA president in opposition to Gwendolyn. A meet-and-greet at Amy's home draws only one visitor, who informs them that Gwendolyn has launched a rival party at her own house, catered by Martha Stewart. In spite of this, the other moms, and Martha, swiftly abandon Gwendolyn's party when it becomes clear that she intends to lecture them all evening, leading to a successful party at Amy's house.\n\nGwendolyn responds by putting drugs in Jane's locker, framing her, which gets her kicked out of all extracurricular activities. Jane and Dylan both go to stay with Mike (who has agreed to an amicable divorce) in response to what they see as Amy's failure as a mom. Amy loses her job because her boss refuses to understand her reasons for taking time off.\n\nA despondent Amy stays home during the PTA election but is roused into action by Carla and Kiki, who finally stands up to her husband and orders him to deal with everything alone until the meeting is over. At the event, Amy gives an inspiring speech about how all the moms are overworked and that they need to take time off, do fewer and less stressful events, and most importantly, allow themselves to make mistakes. Amy wins by a landslide and eventually winds up comforting a devastated Gwendolyn, who reveals that her life is not perfect like she claims it is and that being in charge of the PTA was her only way to take her anger out on the problems she is facing.\n\nSome weeks later, Amy's approach has led to positive changes: Jane has been reinstated to the soccer team and is stressing out less, Dylan is actually applying himself, Kiki makes her husband help out with taking care of their kids, Carla is more responsible and hands-on, and all of the other moms, including Stacy and Vicky, are feeling more energized. Amy herself has gotten her job back with much better compensation after her boss sees how much he had taken her for granted, and she continues to see Jessie. Gwendolyn invites Amy, Carla, and Kiki for a day of fun on her husband's private jet.\n\nThe ending credits play over the cast interviewing their real-life moms.\n\nOn April 30, 2015, it was announced that Jon Lucas and Scott Moore were set to direct an untitled female-led comedy, based on their own original script. Bill Block of Block Entertainment and Raj Brinder Singh of Merced Media Partners would produce the film, along with Judd Apatow and Josh Church through Apatow Productions, while Merced Media financing the film. Leslie Mann was set to star in the lead role. This was Bill Block's first film produced through Block Entertainment after leaving QED International. Paramount Pictures acquired the film's distribution rights on May 8, 2015. The film was sold to different international distributors at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. On June 1, 2015, Mann and Apatow exited the film because of scheduling conflicts. On October 26, 2015, it was reported that Paramount had left the project, with STX Entertainment coming on board to handle the American distribution. Mila Kunis, Christina Applegate, and Kristen Bell joined the film, starring in its lead roles, while Suzanne Todd produced the film along with Block. On January 11, 2016, Jada Pinkett Smith and Kathryn Hahn joined the film, with Smith playing Applegate's blunt best friend, and Hahn also playing a mother. It was later revealed that Oona Laurence had also joined the cast.\n\nPrincipal photography on the film began on January 11, 2016 in New Orleans and concluded on March 1, 2016.\n\nIn May 2015, Paramount set the film a release date for April 15, 2016, but later, in July 2015, the studio moved the film out to a new unspecified release date. STX Entertainment later bought the distribution rights to the film and scheduled for August 19, 2016, before eventually releasing it on July 29, 2016, swapping release dates with \"The Space Between Us\".\n\n\"Bad Moms\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray on November 1, 2016 by Universal Studios Home Entertainment.\n\n\"Bad Moms\" grossed $113.2 million in the United States and Canada and $70.7 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $183.9 million, against a budget of $20 million.\n\n\"Bad Moms\" was released in the United States and Canada on July 29, 2016, alongside \"Jason Bourne\" and \"Nerve\", and was projected to gross around $25 million in its opening weekend, from 3,215 theaters. It grossed $2.1 million from Thursday night previews. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $23.8 million, finishing 3rd at the box office. On September 3, the film crossed $100 million domestically, becoming STX Entertainment's first film to do so. \"Deadline Hollywood\" calculated the net profit of the film to be $50.8 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues.\n\n\"Bad Moms\" received mixed to positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 58% based on 152 reviews with an average rating of 5.6/10, although it received a \"Fresh\" rating among the site's top critics, who approved it by 68% based on 34 reviews with an average rating of 6.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"Bad Moms\" boasts a terrific cast and a welcome twist on domestic comedy -- and they're often enough to compensate for the movie's unfortunate inability to take full advantage of its assets.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 60 out of 100 based on 33 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\n\"IGN\" gave the film 7/10, saying, \"[t]he uneven \"Bad Moms\" is an entry in the slobs versus snobs genre that never quite realizes its full comedic potential.\" Chris Nashawaty of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave it an A-, writing: \"beneath all of its hard-R partying, rebellious debauchery, and profanity, it taps into something very real and insidious in the zeitgeist. It's one of the funniest movies of the year-and one of the most necessary.\" Peter Travers and Kyle Smith both gave 2½ stars out of 4, with Travers saying: \"the movie cops out by going soft in the end, but it's still hardcore hilarity for stressed moms looking for a girls night out\", and Smith saying: \"\"Bad Moms\" is like \"Sex and the City: The Sneakers-and-Minivan Years,\" a good-natured girl-power comedy that balances a bland sitcom structure with some weird and hilarious moments.\"\n\"The A.V. Club\"s Jesse Hassenger opined that \"Bad Moms\" \"sells its characters' struggle short by shuffling their kids off screen whenever it's convenient, and not even in the name of comical neglect; there always seems to be time and money to get a sitter. [...] [This] at times turns the movie into a referendum on unhelpful husbands of well-off moms, rather than the absurdities of Perfect Mom culture.\" Lindsey Bahr of the Associated Press wrote, \"\"Bad Moms\" had so many opportunities to be great, edgy and insightful, but instead settles for the most milquetoast commentary possible on modern motherhood.\"\n\nDirectors of the first film, Lucas and Moore, have stated that they may get involved with the previously announced spin-off, but that their current focus is to make a sequel to \"Bad Moms\". On December 23, 2016, it was announced that \"A Bad Moms Christmas\" would be released on November 1, 2017, and that it would be holiday themed, with Bell, Hahn, and Kunis all returning to reprise their roles. On May 2, 2017, Susan Sarandon, Christine Baranski, Cheryl Hines, and Peter Gallagher joined the cast of the film.\n\nIn October 2016, STX Entertainment announced a spin-off film titled \"Bad Dads\" and set a release date for July 14, 2017. However, by July 2017, the film seems to have been delayed with a new release date not set.\n\nIn February 2018, it was reported that FOX network is developing an unscripted reality TV series which would take the films' premise of imperfect parents and shift the focus to real-life moms. The series will be produced by STXtelevision.\n\n"}

Sky leads the cubs to the mudflats to dig up clams hiding under the mud. The family has a good time until the tide turns. In the chaos, Scout gets stranded on a sandbar. Unable to do much, Sky can only look on as the cub tries to free himself. He finally comes to his senses and swims over to Sky. The family heads to higher ground, where, after another encounter with Magnus, Chinook attacks again. As Sky fights off the male bear, Amber and Scout hide in a nearby log. After Chinook is driven away, Amber reappears from the log, but Scout is nowhere to be seen. Sky looks for him all day, but he's nowhere to be seen. Eventually, just as Sky and Amber are about to give up searching, Scout comes right back out of the log—he'd been hiding there the whole time.\n\nWhen summer comes, so does the yearly salmon run. Dozens of bears gather along salmon streams on the coast to get the best of the run before it ends. This also leads in an increase in dominance fights between Magnus and Chinook. Sky, meanwhile, is looking for a different place to find food. A raven leads Sky and her two cubs to the golden pond just in time to save the brown bear family from their starvation. She and her cubs leave Katmai National Park and Preserve and head north to Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, where a pool filled with salmon supposedly awaits. When the bears arrive, however, they find that the salmon are not there yet. They wait and wait, and the situation gets worse by the hour. When it seems that their journey was for nothing, the salmon arrive. After the family fill themselves on the riches of the feast, they head back to Katmai as winter approaches. When the first snow arrives, all the bears head back up the mountains to their dens to sleep out the harsh cold winter. The cubs have learned a lot from their first year which will greatly help them for the rest of their lives.\n\nThe central brown bear family was filmed at Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska.\n\nFothergill and Scholey previously directed \"African Cats\" together.\n\nOlivia Holt sang her song \"Carry On\" for the movie.\n\n\"Bears\" was released in the United States on April 18, 2014, four days before Earth Day.\n\nThe song, \"Home\" by Phillip Phillips appeared in the trailer and in the movie.\n\n\"Bears\" was released on Blu-ray and DVD combo pack on August 12, 2014.\n\n\"Bears\" received positive reviews from film critics. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 89% based on reviews from 56 critics, with an average score of 7/10, with the critical consensus listed as saying \"Sweet, beautifully filmed, and admirably short on sugarcoating, \"Bears\" continues Disneynature's winning streak\". On Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 based on reviews from critics, the film has a score of 68 based on 20 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews \".\n\n"}
{"id": "2803724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2803724", "title": "Book design", "text": "Book design\n\nBook design is the art of incorporating the content, style, format, design, and sequence of the various components and elements of a book into a coherent unit. In the words of the renowned typographer Jan Tschichold (1902–1974), book design, \"though largely forgotten today, [relies upon] methods and rules upon which it is impossible to improve, [and which] have been developed over centuries. To produce perfect books, these rules have to be brought back to life and applied\". Richard Hendel describes book design as \"an arcane subject\", and refers to the need for a context to understand what that means.\n\nModern books are paginated consecutively, and all pages are counted in the pagination whether or not the numbers appear. The page number, or folio, is most commonly found at the top of the page, flush left verso, flush right recto. The folio may also be printed at the bottom of the page, and in that location it is called a drop folio. Drop folios usually appear either centered on each page or flush left verso and flush right recto.\n\nFront matter (or preliminaries; shortened to \"prelims\") comprises the first section of a book, and is usually the smallest section in terms of the number of pages. Front-matter pages are traditionally numbered in lower-case Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, iv, v, etc.), which prevents renumbering the remainder of a book when front-matter content is added at the last moment, such as a dedication page or additional acknowledgments. Page number is omitted on blank pages and display pages (i.e., such stand-alone pages as those for the half title, frontispiece, title page, colophon, dedication, and epigraph), and it is either omitted or a drop folio is used on the opening page of each section of the front matter (e.g., table of contents, foreword, preface). Front matter generally appears only in the first of a multi-volume work, although some elements (such as a table of contents or index) may appear in each volume.\n\nThe following table defines some common types of front matter, and the \"voice\" (or point of view) in which each can be said to be given:\n\nThe structure of a work—and especially of its body matter—is often described hierarchically.\n\n\nThe first page of the actual text of a book is the opening page, which often incorporates special design features, such as initials. Arabic numbering starts at this first page. If the text is introduced by a second half title or opens with a part title, the half title or part title counts as page one. As in the front matter, page numbers are omitted on blank pages, and are either omitted or a drop folio is used on the opening page of each part and chapter. On pages containing only illustrations or tables, page numbers are usually omitted, except in the case of a long sequence of figures or tables.\n\nThe following are two instructive examples:\n\nThe back matter, also known as end matter, if used, normally consists of one or more of the following components:\n\nArabic numbering continues for the back matter.\n\nThe front cover is the front of the book, and is marked appropriately by text or graphics in order to identify it as such (namely as the very beginning of the book). The front cover usually contains at least the title or author, with possibly an appropriate illustration.\n\nOn the inside of the cover page, extending to the facing page is the front endpaper sometimes referred as FEP. The free half of the end paper is called a \"flyleaf\". Traditionally, in hand-bound books, the endpaper was just a sheet of blank or ornamented paper physically masking and reinforcing the connection between the cover and the body of the book. In modern publishing it can be either plain, as in many text-oriented books, or variously ornamented and illustrated in books such as picture books, other children's literature, some arts and craft and hobbyist books, novelty/gift-market and coffee table books, and graphic novels. These books have an audience and traditions of their own where the graphic design and immediacy is especially important and publishing tradition and formality are less important.\n\nThe spine is the vertical edge of a book as it normally stands on a bookshelf. It is customary for it to have printed text on it. In texts published or printed in the United States and the United Kingdom, the spine text, when vertical, runs from the top to the bottom, such that it is right side up when the book is lying flat with the front cover on top. In books from continental Europe, vertical spine text traditionally runs from the bottom up, though this convention has been changing lately. The spine usually contains all, or some, of four elements (besides decoration, if any), and in the following order: (1) author, editor, or compiler; (2) title; (3) publisher; and (4) publisher logo.\n\nOn the inside of the back cover page, extending from the facing page before it, is the endpaper. Its design matches the front endpaper and, in accordance with it, contains either plain paper or pattern, image etc.\n\nThe back cover often contains biographical matter about the author or editor, and quotes from other sources praising the book. It may also contain a summary or description of the book\n\nBooks are classified under two categories according to the physical nature of their binding. The designation hardcover (or hardback) refers to books with stiff covers, as opposed to flexible ones. The binding of a hardcover book usually includes boards (often made of paperboard) covered in cloth, leather, or other materials. The binding is usually sewn to the pages using string stitching.\n\nA less expensive binding method is that used for paperback books (sometimes called softback or softcover). Most paperbacks are bound with paper or light cardboard, though other materials (such as plastic) are used. The covers are flexible and usually bound to the pages using glue (perfect binding). Some small paperback books are sub-classified as pocketbooks. These paperbacks are smaller than usual—small enough to barely fit into a pocket (especially the back pocket of one's trousers). However, this capacity to fit into a pocket diminishes with increasing number of pages and increasing thickness of the book. Such a book may still be designated as a pocketbook.\n\nSome books such as Bibles or dictionaries may have a thumb index to help find material quickly. Gold leaf may also be applied to the edges of the pages, so that when closed, the side, top, and bottom of the book have a golden color. On some books, a design may be printed on the edges, or marbling or a simple colour applied. Some artist's books go even further, by using fore-edge painting. Pop-up elements and fold-out pages may be used to add dimensions to the page in different ways. Children's books commonly incorporate a wide array of design features built into the fabric of the book. Some books for preschoolers include textured fabric, plastic on other materials. Die-cut techniques in the work of Eric Carle are one example. Clear or reflective surfaces, flaps, textiles and scratch-and-sniff are other possible features.\n\nA basic unit in book design is the page spread. The left page (called \"verso\") and right page (called \"recto\") are of the same size and aspect ratio, and are centered on the gutter where they are bound together at the spine.\n\nThe design of each individual page, on the other hand, is governed by the canons of page construction.\n\nThe possible layout of the sets of letters of the alphabet, or words, on a page is determined by the so-called print space, and is also an element in the design of the page of the book. Clearly, there must be sufficient space, at the spine of the book, if the text is to be visible. On the other hand, the other three margins of the page, which frame the book, are made of the appropriate size for both practical and aesthetic reasons.\n\nThe print space (German \"Satzspiegel\") is a typographic term and determines the effective area on the paper of a book, journal or other press work. The print space is limited by the surrounding borders, or in other words the gutters outside the printed area.\n\nThe German term comes originally from hot-metal typesetting: above the desktop was a mirror (German: \"Spiegel\") where the typesetter could read the inverted letters.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "161882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=161882", "title": "Cat Ballou", "text": "Cat Ballou\n\nCat Ballou is a 1965 American western musical comedy film starring Jane Fonda and Lee Marvin, who won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his dual role. The story involves a woman who hires a notorious gunman to protect her father's ranch, and later to avenge his murder, but finds that the gunman is not what she expected. The supporting cast features Tom Nardini, Michael Callan, Dwayne Hickman, and singers Nat King Cole and Stubby Kaye, who together perform the movie's theme song, onscreen, throughout the film.\n\nThe film was directed by Elliot Silverstein from a screenplay by Walter Newman and Frank Pierson from the novel \"The Ballad of Cat Ballou\" by Roy Chanslor. Chanslor's novel was a serious Western, and though it was turned into a comedy for the movie, the filmmakers retained some darker elements. The film references many classic Western films, notably \"Shane\".\n\nCatherine \"Cat\" Ballou, who wants to be a schoolteacher, is returning home from boarding school by train to (fictional) Wolf City, Wyoming, to the ranch of her father, Frankie Ballou. On the way, she unwittingly helps accused cattle rustler Clay Boone elude his captor, Sheriff Maledon, when Boone's Uncle Jed, a drunkard disguised as a preacher, distracts the lawman.\n\nArriving home, Cat learns that the Wolf City Development Corporation is scheming to take the ranch from her father, whose sole defender is his ranch hand, educated Native American Jackson Two-Bears. Clay and Jed appear and reluctantly offer to help Catherine, and she hires legendary gunfighter Kid Shelleen to help protect her father from gunslinger Tim Strawn, the hired killer who is threatening him.\n\nShelleen arrives, and proves to be a drunken bum whose pants fall down when he draws his gun, and who is unable to hit a barn when he shoots. Strawn kills Frankie, and when the townspeople refuse to bring Strawn to justice, Catherine becomes a revenge-seeking outlaw known as Cat Ballou. She and her gang rob a train carrying the Wolf City payroll, then take refuge in \"Hole-in-the-Wall\", where desperados go to hide from the law, but are thrown out when it is learned what they have done, since Hole-in-the-Wall can only continue to exist on the sufferance of Wolf City. Shelleen, inspired by his caring affection for Cat, works himself into shape, dresses up in his finest gunfighting outfit, and goes into town to kill Strawn, casually revealing later that Strawn is his brother.\n\nCat poses as a prostitute and confronts Sir Harry Percival, the head of the Wolf City Development Corporation. A struggle ensues, Sir Harry is killed, and Cat is sentenced to be hanged. With Sir Harry dead, there's no hope for Wolf City's future, and the townspeople have no mercy for Cat. As the noose is placed around her neck, Uncle Jed appears, again dressed as a preacher, and cuts the rope just as the trapdoor is opened. Cat falls through and onto a wagon and her gang spirits her away in a daring rescue.\n\n\nCole and Kaye, billed simply as \"Shouters\", act as a Greek chorus, intermittently appearing onscreen to narrate the story through ongoing verses of \"The Ballad of Cat Ballou\", one of the songs written by Mack David and Jerry Livingston for the film.\n\n\nThe film was well received by critics and was popular with moviegoers and earned over $20.6 million in ticket sales in 1965, making it one of the top ten moneymaking movies that year.\n\nBosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" called it \"a breezy little film\" which \"does have flashes of good satiric wit. But, under Elliott Silverstein's direction, it is mostly just juvenile lampoon.\" \"Variety\" wrote that the film \"emerges middlingly successful, sparked by an amusing way-out approach and some sparkling performances.\" Richard L. Coe of \"The Washington Post\" praised the film as a \"springy satire,\" adding, \"What makes this fun is the style. Forming a mighty cool duo, Nat King Cole and Stubby Kaye sing their way in and out of the plot with folk songs which Cole 'Don't Fence Me In' Porter would have relished. The format is novel and stylishly delivered.\" Pauline Kael in \"Film Quarterly\" called it \"lumpen, coy, and obvious, a self-consciously cute movie,\" adding that \"mainly it is full of sort-of-funny and trying-to-be-funny \"ideas;\" and a movie is not just ideas.\" Philip K. Scheuer of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote, \"I'm in the minority, apparently. 'Cat Ballou,' which is being hailed as a cowboy 'Tom Jones' or something of the sort, seems to me about as funny as a soundtrack burp.\" \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" wrote, \"The jokes in \"Cat Ballou\" are uneven, but the mood behind the film is happily consistent.\"\n\nThe film holds a score of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 21 reviews, with an average grade of 7.4 out of 10.\n\n\nIn his Oscar acceptance speech, Lee Marvin concluded by saying, \"I think, though, that half of this belongs to a horse somewhere out in San Fernando Valley,\" a reference to the horse Kid Shelleen rode, which appeared to be as drunk as Shelleen was.\n\nAt the 38th Academy Awards, the film also generated nominations for: \n\nAt the 23rd Golden Globe Awards, the film also generated nominations for: \n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\nIn June 2008, AFI revealed its \"Ten top Ten\"—the best ten films in ten \"classic\" American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. \"Cat Ballou\" was acknowledged as the tenth best film in the Western genre.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "41660263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41660263", "title": "Critical making", "text": "Critical making\n\nCritical making refers to the hands-on productive activities that link digital technologies to society.\nIt was invented to bridge the gap between creative physical and conceptual exploration. The purpose of critical making resides in the learning extracted from the process of making rather than the experience derived from the finished output. The term \"critical making\" was popularized by Matt Ratto, an Associate Professor at the University of Toronto. Ratto describes one of the main goals of critical making as way \"to use material forms of engagement with technologies to supplement and extend critical reflection and, in doing so, to reconnect our lived experiences with technologies to social and conceptual critique.\" \"Critical making\", as defined by practitioners like Matt Ratto and Stephen Hockema, \"is an elision of two typically disconnected modes of engagement in the world — \"critical thinking,\" often considered as abstract, explicit, linguistically based, internal and cognitively individualistic; and \"making,\" typically understood as tacit, embodied, external, and community-oriented.\"\nMatt Ratto coined the term in 2008 to describe his workshop activities that linked conceptual reflection and technical making. This concept explores how learning is influenced by the learner's participation towards creating and/or making things within a technological context. Ratto's first publication to use the term was in 2009. Ratto claims that his goal was to connect the conceptual understanding of technology in social life to materialized activities. By situating himself within the area of \"design-oriented research\" rather than \"research-oriented research,\" Ratto believes that critical making enhances the shared experience in both theoretical and practical understandings of critical socio-technical issues. However, critical making should not be reviewed as design, but rather as a type of practice. The quality of a critical making lab is evaluated based on the physical \"making\" process, regardless of quality of the final material production. Prior studies have noted the separation between critical thinking and physical \"making\". Specifically, experts in technology lack a knowledge of art, and vice versa. However it is very important that technology be embedded in a context rather than being left in isolation, especially when it comes to critical making.\n\nThe Critical Making Lab was founded by Matt Ratto in the Faculty of Information, University of Toronto. The Critical Making Lab provides participants tools and basic knowledge of digital technology used in critical making. The mission of the lab is to enhance collaboration, communication, and the practice-based engagement in critical making.\n\nThe main focus of critical making is open design.Open design develops a critical perspective on the current institutions, practices and norms of society, reconnecting materiality and morality. Matt Ratto introduces Critical Making as processes of material and conceptual exploration and creation of novel understandings by the makers themselves. Critical Making includes digital software and hardware. Software usually refers to the Raspberry Pi or Arduino. Hardware refers to a computer, or any other device that facilitates an operation.\n\nIn 2012, Garnet Hertz adopted the term for a series of ten handmade booklets titled \"Critical Making\" published in 2012. It explores how hands-on productive work ‐ making ‐ can supplement and extend critical reflection on technology and society. It works to blend and extend the fields of design, contemporary art, DIY/craft and technological development. In this project, 70 different authors - including Norman White, Julian Bleecker, Dunne & Raby, Daniel Charny, Albert Borgmann, Golan Levin, Matt Ratto, Natalie Jeremijenko, McKenzie Wark, Paul Dourish, Mitch Altman, Dale Dougherty, Mark Pauline, Scott Snibbe, Reed Ghazala and others - reflected on the term and critical responses to the maker movement. Generally speaking, Hertz's use of the term critical making is focused around studio production and the creation of objects as \"things to think with\".\n\nHertz initially set out to make a zine of about 50 pages but was flooded with almost 300 pages of original content from approximately sixty people. It consisted of academic papers, detailed technical projects, interviews and documented pieces of artwork. He then categorised the information into specific topics thereby producing multiple booklets. The booklet itself is a testament to critical making. It was printed using a hacked photocopier and roughly 100,000 pages were manually folded and stapled to create 300 copies of 10 booklets each. The publication asks us to look at aspects of the DIY culture that go beyond buying an Arduino, getting a MakerBot and reducing DIY to a weekend hobby. These books embrace social issues, the history of technology, activism and politics. The project also stems from a specific disappointment. Recently, Make received a grant from DARPA to create \"makerspaces\" for teenagers. Everyone who had assumed that a culture built on openness was antithetical to the murkiness that surrounds the military world was bitterly disheartened. However, CM is not the anti-Make Magazine, it is simply an alternative, a forum for electronic DIY practice to discuss hacking, making, kludging, DIYing in a less sanitized, mass-market way.\n\nIn 2014, Hertz founded \"The Studio for Critical Making\" at Emily Carr University of Art and Design as Canada Research Chair in Design and Media Arts. The facility \"explores how humanities-based modes of critical inquiry – like the arts and ethics – can be directly applied to building more engaging product concepts and information technologies. The lab works to replace the traditional engineering goals of efficiency, speed or usability with more complex cultural, social and human-oriented values. The end result is technology that is more culturally relevant, socially engaged and personalized.\" \n\nIn 2012, John Maeda began using the term while at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD): first as a title for their strategic plan for 2012-2017 and next as part of the title of an edited collection titled \"The Art of Critical Making: Rhode Island School of Design on Creative Practice\" published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Other individuals who use the term critical making to orient their work include Amaranth Borsuk (University of Washington-Bothell), Jentery Sayers (University of Victoria), Roger Whitson (Washington State University), Kari Kraus (University of Maryland), Amy Papaelias (SUNY-New Paltz), and Jessica Barness (Kent State University).\n\nTraditional DIY is criticized due to its costs and standards. DIY products are difficult to spread in lower-income areas where issues of cost and ease are more commonly cited (William, 276). Today, TET increases the technological standard of DIY, enhance the modernity of it, and open up a more practical and advanced area for DIY projects to develop. It is not only a lifestyle choices but also a technological product. \"DIY activity is not for example seen as a coping practice used by those unable to afford to externalise the activity to formal firms and/or self-employed individuals. Instead, and reflecting the broader cultural turn in retail studies, their explanation for engagement in DIY is firmly grounded in human agency\" (Williams, 273).\n\nAccording to DiSalvo and Lukens, \"Speculative design is an approach to design that emphasizes inquiry, experimentation, and expression, over usability, usefulness or desirability. A particular characteristic of speculative design is that it tends to be future-oriented. However this should not be mistaken as being fantasy-like sense, suggesting, that is \"unreal\" and therefore dismissible (DiSalvo and Lukens, 2009).\"\n\nThe term speculative design involves practices from various disciplines, including visionary or futurist forms of architecture, design fiction, and critical design or design for debate instead of referring a specific movement or style. More than just diagrams of unbuilt structures, speculative design aims to explore the space of interaction between culture, technology, and the built environment (Lukens and DiSalvo, 2012, p. 25). Practitioners of speculative design engage in design as a sort of provocation, one that asks uncomfortable questions about the long-term implications of technology. These practices also integrate pairs of concerns that are traditionally separate, such as fact and fiction, science and art, and commerce and academia. This provocation extends to questions about design itself.\n\n3D Printing allows for the relatively cheap and customizable design of objects which are often integrated into critical making projects. There are two types of industrial manufacturing. The first is subtractive manufacturing, which involves shaping a material through a process of chipping / removing some of its substance (think whittling a figure out of wood). The second is additive manufacturing, which is created by adding material into a product. The basic steps of 3D printing are digital design: design the object you want to print using digital design software OR download a design from a website (like Thingiverse, for example), press print and the printer will begin creating a physical version of your digital design. 3D printers use layerization to create objects. 3D printers use a variety of materials to create objects, including plastic, metal and nylon (Flemming, What is 3D printing?). The Makerbot, for example, uses polylactic acid (PLA), a substance derived from corn. The coiled PLA filament is pulled into the machine via a tube and then heated up by the extruder, causing the PLA to melt. This melted material forms the model's layers, which is applied in approximately .02 - 1 millimeter layers. The model is built up until it is finished.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "456410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=456410", "title": "Crystal system", "text": "Crystal system\n\nIn crystallography, the terms crystal system, crystal family, and lattice system each refer to one of several classes of space groups, lattices, point groups, or crystals. Informally, two crystals are in the same crystal system if they have similar symmetries, although there are many exceptions to this.\n\nCrystal systems, crystal families and lattice systems are similar but slightly different, and there is widespread confusion between them: in particular the trigonal crystal system is often confused with the rhombohedral lattice system, and the term \"crystal system\" is sometimes used to mean \"lattice system\" or \"crystal family\".\n\nSpace groups and crystals are divided into seven crystal systems according to their point groups, and into seven lattice systems according to their Bravais lattices. Five of the crystal systems are essentially the same as five of the lattice systems, but the hexagonal and trigonal crystal systems differ from the hexagonal and rhombohedral lattice systems. The six crystal families are formed by combining the hexagonal and trigonal crystal systems into one hexagonal family, in order to eliminate this confusion.\n\nA lattice system is a class of lattices with the same set of lattice point groups, which are subgroups of the arithmetic crystal classes. The 14 Bravais lattices are grouped into seven lattice systems: triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal, rhombohedral, hexagonal, and cubic.\n\nIn a crystal system, a set of point groups and their corresponding space groups are assigned to a lattice system. Of the 32 point groups that exist in three dimensions, most are assigned to only one lattice system, in which case both the crystal and lattice systems have the same name. However, five point groups are assigned to two lattice systems, rhombohedral and hexagonal, because both exhibit threefold rotational symmetry. These point groups are assigned to the trigonal crystal system. In total there are seven crystal systems: triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal, trigonal, hexagonal, and cubic.\n\nA crystal family is determined by lattices and point groups. It is formed by combining crystal systems which have space groups assigned to a common lattice system. In three dimensions, the crystal families and systems are identical, except the hexagonal and trigonal crystal systems, which are combined into one hexagonal crystal family. In total there are six crystal families: triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal, hexagonal, and cubic.\n\nSpaces with less than three dimensions have the same number of crystal systems, crystal families and lattice systems. In one-dimensional space, there is one crystal system. In 2D space, there are four crystal systems: oblique, rectangular, square, and hexagonal.\n\nThe relation between three-dimensional crystal families, crystal systems and lattice systems is shown in the following table: \n\nThe 7 crystal systems consist of 32 crystal classes (corresponding to the 32 crystallographic point groups) as shown in the following table:\n\nPoint symmetry can be thought of in the following fashion: consider the coordinates which make up the structure, and project them all through a single point, so that (\"x\",\"y\",\"z\") becomes (−\"x\",−\"y\",−\"z\"). This is the 'inverted structure'. If the original structure and inverted structure are identical, then the structure is \"centrosymmetric\". Otherwise it is \"non-centrosymmetric\". Still, even for non-centrosymmetric case, inverted structure in some cases can be rotated to align with the original structure. This is the case of non-centrosymmetric achiral structure. If the inverted structure cannot be rotated to align with the original structure, then the structure is chiral (enantiomorphic) and its symmetry group is \"enantiomorphic\".\n\nA direction (meaning a line without an arrow) is called \"polar\" if its two directional senses are geometrically or physically different. A polar symmetry direction of a crystal is called a polar axis. Groups containing a polar axis are called \"polar\". A polar crystal possess a \"unique\" axis (found in no other directions) such that some geometrical or physical property is different at the two ends of this axis. It may develop a dielectric polarization, e.g. in pyroelectric crystals. A polar axis can occur only in non-centrosymmetric structures. There should also not be a mirror plane or twofold axis perpendicular to the polar axis, because they will make both directions of the axis equivalent.\n\nThe crystal structures of chiral biological molecules (such as protein structures) can only occur in the 65 enantiomorphic space groups (biological molecules are usually chiral). \n\nThe distribution of the 14 Bravais lattices into lattice systems and crystal families is given in the following table.\n\nIn geometry and crystallography, a Bravais lattice is a category of symmetry groups for translational symmetry in three directions, or correspondingly, a category of translation lattices.\n\nSuch symmetry groups consist of translations by vectors of the form\n\nwhere \"n\", \"n\", and \"n\" are integers and a, a, and a are three non-coplanar vectors, called \"primitive vectors\".\n\nThese lattices are classified by space group of the translation lattice itself; there are 14 Bravais lattices in three dimensions; each can apply in one lattice system only. They represent the maximum symmetry a structure with the translational symmetry concerned can have.\n\nAll crystalline materials must, by definition fit in one of these arrangements (not including quasicrystals).\n\nFor convenience a Bravais lattice is depicted by a unit cell which is a factor 1, 2, 3 or 4 larger than the primitive cell. Depending on the symmetry of a crystal or other pattern, the fundamental domain is again smaller, up to a factor 48.\n\nThe Bravais lattices were studied by Moritz Ludwig Frankenheim in 1842, who found that there were 15 Bravais lattices. This was corrected to 14 by A. Bravais in 1848.\n\n‌The four-dimensional unit cell is defined by four edge lengths (\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\") and six interaxial angles (\"α\", \"β\", \"γ\", \"δ\", \"ε\", \"ζ\"). The following conditions for the lattice parameters define 23 crystal families\n\nThe names here are given according to Whittaker. They are almost the same as in Brown \"et al\", with exception for names of the crystal families 9, 13, and 22. The names for these three families according to Brown \"et al\" are given in parenthesis.\n\nThe relation between four-dimensional crystal families, crystal systems, and lattice systems is shown in the following table. Enantiomorphic systems are marked with an asterisk. The number of enantiomorphic pairs are given in parentheses. Here the term \"enantiomorphic\" has a different meaning than in the table for three-dimensional crystal classes. The latter means, that enantiomorphic point groups describe chiral (enantiomorphic) structures. In the current table, \"enantiomorphic\" means that a group itself (considered as a geometric object) is enantiomorphic, like enantiomorphic pairs of three-dimensional space groups P3 and P3, P422 and P422. Starting from four-dimensional space, point groups also can be enantiomorphic in this sense.\n\n\n"}

She was recognized as one of the most innovative creators of contemporary dance in western Europe.\n\nBorn in Versailles, Adret began her dance training at an early age. In the 1930s she studied with the leading Franco-Russian teachers in Paris, including Victor Gsovsky and Serge Lifar. In the late 1940s, following World War II, she had a modest career with the Paris Opera Ballet, making a notable appearance at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in 1948 in a principal role in Lifar's production of \"Le Pas d'Acier\" (\"The Steel Step\"), a modern ballet about Soviet factory workers set to a score in \"le style mécanique\" by Prokofiev.\n\nFrom Lifar, director of the Paris Opera Ballet from 1930-44, and from 1947-58, she learned much about company administration and direction. Under his guidance, she made her first choreography, entitled \"La Conjuration\" (\"The Conspiracy\"), in 1948. Based on a poem by René Char, it was set to music by Jacques Porte and had décor by Georges Braque.\n\nLater that year, Adret left the Paris Opera Ballet and beame ballet mistress of Roland Petit's Ballets de Paris, touring with the company in western Europe. In 1951 she succeeded Darja Collin as director of the Ballet of the Netherlands Opera in Amsterdam while continuing to work with Petit's company, raising the technical level of the dancers in both companies. Working in Amsterdam until 1958, she also expanded the repertory of the Dutch company with classical ballets and a number of original choreographic works.\n\nIn 1960, she became ballet mistress of the Ballet de l'Opéra de Nice and remained with that company until 1963, staging opera divertissements and modern ballets. She then spent a few years as an international guest choreographer, staging works for Le Grand Ballet du Marquis de Cuevas in Paris, PACT/TRUK Ballet in Johannesburg, the Warsaw Opera Ballet, the Zagreb Opera Ballet, and the Harkness Ballet in New York City. While residing in Panama, she created the Ballet Nacional de Panamá.\n\nReturning to France, Adret joined Jean-Albert Cartier in 1968 in the creation of the Ballet Théâtre Contemporain, the first national choreographic center, established in Amiens. She was choreographic director of the repertory, and for it she created some of her most notable works, including \"Aquathémes\" and \"Requiem\". In 1972, the company moved from Amiens to Angers and embarked on its first tour of North America.\n\nAdret remained with Ballet Théâtre Contemporain for ten years, until 1978, when it was subsumed by the activities of the newly established Centre National de Danse Contemporaine. She was then appointed inspector general for dance projects in the Ministry of Culture, a post she retained until 1985, when she was invited by Louis Erlo, director of the Lyon Opera, to create a new ballet company committed to contemporary choreographers. During her seven years there, until 1992, Adret put the company in the forefront of contemporary dance in France.\n\nAdret next became artistic director and chief choreographer of the Ballet du Nord in Roubaix, where in 1994 she mounted two new versions of \"Symphonie de Psaumes\" and \"Le Tricorne\". From 1995 to 1998 the Association Française d'Action Artistique sent her on three overseas missions, during which she taught dance classes and choreographed works in Seoul, South Korea, in Montevideo, Uruguay, and in Asunción, Paraguay. She then returned to France, working again with Roland Petit, serving as ballet mistress of his Ballet National de Marseille in 1997 and 1998. \n\nOn 1 July 1999 she accepted a temporary appointment as artistic director of the Ballet de Lorraine, replacing Pierre Lacotte, who had returned to the Paris Opera Ballet. Nearing her eightieth birthday, she served in that post for an interim period of one year. Since July 2000, she has remained actively interested in the contemporary dance scene in France.\n\nFor her work as inspector general of dance projects in the Ministry of Culture, Adret was made a \"commandeur\" in the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 1983. In recognition of her role in developing contemporary dance in France, she received the Grand Prix National de la Danse in 1987, and in 1994 she was named as a \"chevalier\" in the Ordre National de la Légion d'Honneur.\n\nA small, energetic woman with a sparkling wit, Adret was generally acknowledged as a \"figure incontournable\" (\"indispensable person\") in twentieth-century French dance. She was praised for her work as a pedagogue and greatly admired for her unique artistic vision, which allowed her to reconcile her dance works on the cutting edge of modernity with the classic ballet repertory of yesteryear.\n\n"}

His themes are generally historical, and he treated them on a colossal scale and in an emotional naturalistic style, with a distinct revelling in horrible subjects and details. He made his Paris Salon début in 1882 with \"Vitellis traîné dans les rues de Rome par la populace (Vitellius dragged through the streets of Rome by the people)\" (1882; Sens). He followed this the year afterwards with \"Andromaque\" (1882–83; Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen), which won that year's prestigious Prix du Salon. There followed \"La Jacquerie\" (1885; Untraced), \"Le mort de Babylone (The fall of Babylon)\" (1891; Untraced), \"The death of the Emperor Geta\" (1899; Musée de Picardie, Amiens), and \"Barbarian ambassadors at the Court of Justinian\" (1907; Untraced), all of which exemplify his strong and spirited but sensational and often brutal painting.

Subtitled \"Intermezzo Scene\", it was published by Bosworth in 1921. It evokes exotic images of camel-drivers, jugglers, and snake-charmers. When it was first published in a version for piano, it was advertised as an \"educational novelty\".\n\nA synopsis of scenes by the composer mentions a caravan arriving, beggars, a princess carried by servants, jugglers, snake-charmers, and a caliph. After the princess and the caliph have left, a muezzin calls to prayer from a minaret. The caravan continues its journey, and the market becomes silent. The duration is around six minutes.\n\nAn opening march shares \"exotic\" intervals, A – B-flat – E, with the composer's oriental intermezzo \"Wonga\", used for the play \"Ye Gods\" in 1916. A chorus of beggars sings: \"Baksheesh, baksheesh Allah\"; passers-by sing \"Empshi\" (\"get away\"). A romantic theme portrays the princess, similar to Stravinsky's \"Firebird\". Trumpets announce the caliph. The concluding section \"Call to prayer\" of 22 measures was added later.\n\nThe music was first announced in \"Musical Opinion\" in January 1921 as a piano piece, in a section \"Educational novelties”. Half a year later, Bosworth printed the orchestral version.\n\n\"In a Persian Market\" has been regarded as a work of orchestral impressionism. The work has been used as theatre music for comic oriental scenes, used in sketches by Morecambe and Wise, and by The Two Ronnies, and also in schools as theatrical repertory.\n\n\"In a Persian Market\" was recorded completely, with chorus, in 1999 by the New London Light Opera Chorus and the New London Orchestra, conducted by Ronald Corp. It is part of a 2002 recording of the same name, an anthology of historic recordings of works by Ketèlbey performed by different ensembles and conductors (including the composer) made between 1917 and 1939.\nAlso music was used in \"My Lady Heroine\" by French singer serge Gainsbourg.\n\n"}

Remembered best for the 1950s television comedy \"I Married Joan\", Davis had a successful earlier career as a B-movie actress and a leading star of 1940s radio comedy.\n\nBorn in Saint Paul, Minnesota, she was the only child of LeRoy Davis and Nina Mae (née Sinks) Davis, who were married in St. Paul on November 23, 1910. Davis had been a performer since childhood. She appeared with her husband Si Wills in vaudeville.\n\nDavis' first film was a short subject for Educational Pictures called \"Way Up Thar\" (1935), featuring a then-unknown Roy Rogers. Educational's distribution company, Twentieth Century-Fox, signed Davis for feature films. Tall and lanky, with a comically flat speaking voice, she became known as one of the few female physical clowns of her time. Perhaps best known for her co-starring turn with Bud Abbott and Lou Costello in \"Hold That Ghost\" (1941), she had a reputation for flawless physical comedy.\n\nHer pantomime sequence in \"Beautiful But Broke\" (1944) was a slapstick construction-site episode. She also featured in \"Tail Spin\" (1939) as a supporting actor, for the women's Bendix Air Race circuit. She co-starred with Eddie Cantor in two features, \"Show Business\" (1944) and \"If You Knew Susie\" (1948).\n\nJoan Davis entered radio with an August 28, 1941, appearance on \"The Rudy Vallee Show\" and became a regular on that show four months later.\nDavis then began a series of shows that established her as a top star of radio situation comedy throughout the 1940s. When Vallee left for the Coast Guard in 1943, Davis and Jack Haley became the co-hosts of the show. With a title change to \"The Sealtest Village Store\", Davis was the owner-operator of the store from July 8, 1943, to June 28, 1945, when she left to do \"Joanie's Tea Room\" on CBS from September 3, 1945, to June 23, 1947. Sponsored by Lever Brothers on behalf of Swan Soap, the premise had Davis running a tea shop in the little community of Smallville. The supporting cast featured Verna Felton. Harry von Zell was the announcer, and her head writer was Abe Burrows, formerly the head writer (and co-creator) of \"Duffy's Tavern\" and eventually a legendary Broadway playwright.\n\nThe tea shop setting continued in \"Joan Davis Time\", a CBS Saturday-night series from October 11, 1947, to July 3, 1948. With Lionel Stander as the tea shop manager, the cast also included Hans Conried, Mary Jane Croft, Andy Russell, the Choraliers quintet, and John Rarig and his Orchestra. \"Leave It to Joan\" ran from July 4 to August 22, 1949, as a summer replacement for \"Lux Radio Theater\" and continued from September 9, 1949, to March 3, 1950. She was also heard on CBS July 3 through August 28, 1950. She was a frequent and popular performer on Tallulah Bankhead's legendary radio variety show, \"The Big Show\" (1950–52). Davis was also a regular on Eddie Cantor's \"Time to Smile\" program.\n\nDavis was the star of the unsold pilot \"Let's Join Joanie\", which was recorded in 1950. The proposed series was a television adaptation of \"Leave It to Joan\". When \"I Love Lucy\" premiered in October 1951 on CBS Television and became a top-rated TV series, sponsors wanted more of the same with another actress who was not afraid of strenuous physical comedy.\n\n\"I Married Joan\" premiered in 1952 on NBC, casting Davis as the manic wife of a mild-mannered community judge (Jim Backus), who got her husband into wacky jams with or without the help of a younger sister, played by her real-life daughter, Beverly Wills. \"I Married Joan\" did not achieve the ratings success enjoyed by \"I Love Lucy\", but during its first two years, it received moderately successful ratings, even cracking the top 25 for the 1953–1954 season. However, by the start of its third year, not only were the ratings beginning to slip, but Davis began experiencing heart trouble. As a result, the series was canceled in the spring of 1955. \"I Married Joan\" experienced greater success in off-network syndication; it was one of the earliest series to take advantage of that avenue.\n\nAfter Davis's death in the spring of 1961, \"I Married Joan\" was pulled from syndication until litigation over her estate---including her residuals from the show's syndicated reruns---could be settled in court (an issue complicated by the deaths of all of her next of kin in 1963), according to the \"Los Angeles Times\".\n\nIn 1956, a year after \"I Married Joan\" had ended its primetime run, Davis was approached by ABC to star in \"The Joan Davis Show\". The premise of this proposed series had Davis playing a musical comedy entertainer who had raised a daughter on her own. Davis used her real name as the lead character. Veteran character actress Hope Summers was cast as Joan's housekeeper, and Wills was signed to play Joan's daughter, also named Beverly. Ray Ferrell was cast as Joan's grandson Stevie. In the pilot, Joan was introduced to her five-year-old grandson for the first time and was trying to convince Beverly, despite her hectic show-business schedule and her somewhat zany personality, that she was a loving and responsible grandmother. The pilot did not sell as a series for ABC. It was forgotten among Davis' television work until many years later when the Museum of Television and Radio in New York discovered the program and added it to its collection.\n\nOn May 22, 1961, Davis died of a heart attack at the age of 48 at her home in Palm Springs, California. She was interred in the Holy Cross Cemetery mausoleum in Culver City, California. On October 24, 1963, Davis' mother, daughter Beverly Wills, and two grandchildren were all killed in a house fire in Palm Springs.\n\nJoan Davis has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one for her contribution to the motion picture industry at 1501 Vine Street and one for radio in the 1700 block of Vine.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9361252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9361252", "title": "Latin American art", "text": "Latin American art\n\nLatin American art is the combined artistic expression of South America, Central America, the Caribbean, and Mexico, as well as Latin Americans living in other regions.\n\nThe art has roots in the many different indigenous cultures that inhabited the Americas before European colonization in the 16th century. The indigenous cultures each developed sophisticated artistic disciplines, which were highly influenced by religious and spiritual concerns. Their work is collectively known and referred to as Pre-columbian art. The blending of Native American, African and European cultures has resulted in a unique mestizo tradition.\n\nDuring the colonial period, a mixture of indigenous traditions and European influences (mainly due to the Christian teachings of Franciscan, Augustinian and Dominican friars) produced a very particular Christian art known as Indochristian art. In addition to indigenous art, the development of Latin American visual art was significantly influenced by Spanish, Portuguese, and French and Dutch Baroque painting. In turn Baroque painting was often influenced by the Italian masters.\n\nGillis van van Schendel (ca. 1635–1678/9) the younger. sign. active 17 Jh. \nBrasilianische Gebirgslandschaft mit Bergziege und Gebirgsbach (Brazilian Landscape with goats, a waterfall and a palmtree)\n(The scene may be a view of the waterfalls in the virgin forests in Teresópolis which runs through the Parquequer river, near Recife, Brasil) \" aside from the well-known artists, other painters, draughtsman and engravers must have been gravitating toward this most interesting and stimulating little Court. They were doubtless entranced by the grat adventure, by the opportunity to interpret exotic themes, either on the spot or after sketches made in these foreign parts and vicariously used after their return a patria \"\n(Lit.: Some seventeen-century paintings of Brazil,\" The Connoisseur, October 1970, page. 130) oil on canvas., 119 x 99 cm\n\nThe Cuzco School is viewed as the first center of European-style painting in the Americas. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Spanish art instructors taught Quechua artists to paint religious imagery based on classical and Renaissance styles.\n\nIn eighteenth-century New Spain, Mexican artists along with a few Spanish artists produced paintings of a system of racial hierarchy, known as casta paintings. It was almost exclusively a Mexican form however, one set was produced in Peru. In a break from religious paintings of the preceding centuries, casta paintings were a secular art form. Only one known casta painting by a relatively unknown painter, Luis de Mena, combines castas with Mexico's Virgin of Guadalupe; this being an exception. Some of Mexico's most distinguished artists painted casta works, including Miguel Cabrera. Most casta paintings were on multiple canvases, with one family grouping on each. There were a handful of single canvas paintings, showing the entire racial hierarchy. The paintings show idealized family groupings, with the father being of one racial, the mother of another racial category, and their offspring being a third racial category. This genre of painting flourished for about a century, coming to an end with Mexican independence in 1821, and the abolition of legal racial categories.\n\nIn the seventeenth century, The Netherlands had captured the rich sugar-producing area of the Portuguese colony of Brazil (1630–1654). During that period, Dutch artist Albert Eckhout painted a number of important depictions of social types in Brazil. These depictions included images of indigenous men and women, as well as still lifes.\n\nScientific expeditions approved by the Spanish crown began exploring Spanish America where its flora and fauna were recorded. Spaniard José Celestino Mutis, a medical doctor and horticulturalist and follower of Swedish scientist Carl Linnaeus, led an expedition starting in 1784 to northern South America, the expedition is known as the \"Expedición Botánica de Nueva Granada\". Local artists were Ecuadorean Indians, who produced five thousand color drawings of nature, all being published. The crown chartered expedition whose purpose was scientific recording of the natural beauty and wealth of Nature, was a departure from the long traditional religious art.\n\nThe most important scientific expedition was that of Alexander von Humboldt and French botantist Aimé Bonpland. They traveled for five years throughout Spanish America (1799-1804), exploring and recording scientific information as well as the attire and lifestyles local populations. Humboldt's work became an inspiration and template for continuing scientific work in the nineteenth century, as well as traveller reporters who recorded the scenes of everyday life.\n\nThe history of Latin American art has generally been written by those with training in art history departments. However, the concept of \"visual culture\" has now brought scholars trained in other disciplines to write the histories of art. As with the history of indigenous peoples, for many years there was a focus on either the pre-Columbian period (Olmec, Maya, Aztec, Inca) art production, then a leap to the twentieth century. More recently, the colonial era and the nineteenth century have developed as fields of focus. Visual culture as a field increasingly crosses disciplinary boundaries. Colonial architecture has been the subject of a number of important studies.\n\nColonial art has a long tradition, especially in Mexico, with there being publications of Manuel Toussaint. In recent years, there has been a boom in publications on colonial art, with some useful overviews being published in recent years. Many works deal exclusively with Spanish America.\n\nMajor exhibitions on colonial art have resulted in fine catalogs as a permanent record.\n\nModernism, a Western art movement typified by the rejection of traditional classical styles. This movement holds an ambivalent position in Latin American art. Not all countries developed modernized urban centers at the same time, so Modernism's appearance in Latin America is difficult to date. While Modernism was welcomed by some, others rejected it. Generally speaking, the countries of the Southern Cone were more open to foreign influence, while countries with a stronger indigenous presence such as Mexico, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia were resistant to European culture.\n\nA landmark event for Modernism in the region was, the \"Semana de Arte Moderna\" or Modern Art Week, a festival that took place in São Paulo, Brazil, in 1922, marking the beginning of Brazil's Modernismo movement. \"[T]hough a number of individual Brazilian artists were doing modernist work before the Week, it coalesced and defined the movement and introduced it to Brazilian society at large.\"\n\nIn general, the artistic Eurocentrism associated with the colonial period began to fade in the early twentieth century, as Latin Americans began to acknowledge their unique identity and started to follow their own path.\n\nFrom the early twentieth century onward, the art of Latin America was greatly inspired by Constructivism. It quickly spread from Russia to Europe, and then into Latin America. Joaquín Torres García and Manuel Rendón have been credited with bringing the Constructivist Movement from Europe, to Latin America.\n\nAfter a long and successful career in Europe and the United States, Joaquín Torres-García, returned to his native Uruguay in 1934, where he heavily promoted Constructivism. Attracting a circle of experienced peers and young artists as followers in Montevideo, in 1935 he founded the Asociación de Arte Constructivo as an art center and exhibition space for his circle. The venue was closed in 1940 due to a lack of funding. In 1943, he opened the Taller Torres-García, a workshop and training center that operated until 1962.\n\nMuralism or Muralismo is an important artistic movement generated in Latin America. It is popularly represented by the Mexican muralism movement of Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, José Clemente Orozco, and Rufino Tamayo. In Chile, José Venturelli and Pedro Nel Gómez were influential muralists. Santiago Martinez Delgado championed muralism in Colombia, as did Gabriel Bracho in Venezuela. In the Dominican Republic, Spanish exile José Vela Zanetti was a prolific muralist, painting over 100 murals in the country. The Ecuadorian artist Oswaldo Guayasamín (a student of Orozco), the Brazilian Candido Portinari, and Bolivian Miguel Alandia Pantoja are also noteworthy. Some of the most impressive \"Muralista\" works can be found in Mexico, Colombia, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia. Mexican Muralism \"enjoyed a type of prestige and influence in other countries that no other American art movement had ever experienced.\" Through Muralism, artists in Latin America found a distinctive art form that provided for political and cultural expression, often focusing on issues of social justice related to their indigenous roots.\n\n\"Generación de la Ruptura,\" or \"Rupture Generation,\" (sometimes simply known as \"Ruptura\") is the name given to an art movement in Mexico in 1960s in which younger artists broke away from the established national style of Muralismo. Born out of the desire of younger artists for greater freedom of style in art, this movement is marked by expressionistic and figurative styles. Mexican artist José Luis Cuevas is credited with initiating the \"Ruptura\". In 1958, Cuevas published a paper called \"La Cortina del Nopal\" (\"The Cactus Curtain\"), which condemned Mexican muralism as overly political, calling it \"cheap journalism and harangue\" rather than art. Representative artists include José Luis Cuevas, Alberto Gironella, and Rafael Coronel.\n\"Nueva Presencia\" (\"new presence\") was an artist group founded by artists Arnold Belkin and Fancisco Icaza in the early 1960s. In response to WWII atrocities such as the Holocaust and the atomic bomb, the artists of Nueva Presencia shared an anti-aesthetic rejection of contemporary trends in art and believed that the artist had a social responsibility. Their beliefs were outlined in the Nueva Presencia manifesto, which was published in the first issue of the poster review of the same name. \"No one, especially the artist, has the right to be indifferent to the social order.\" Members of the group included Francisco\nCorzas (b. 1936), Emilio Ortiz (b. 1936), Leonel Góngora (b.1933), Artemio Sepúlveda (b. 1936), and José Muñoz, Francisco Corzas, and photographer Ignacio \"Nacho\" López.\n\n\"Otra Figuración\" (Other Figuration) was an Argentine artist group and commune formed in 1961, and disbanded in 1966. Members Rómulo Macció, Ernesto Deira, Jorge de la Vega, and Luis Felipe Noé lived together and shared a studio in Buenos Aires. Artists of Otra Figuración worked in an expressionistic abstract figurative style featuring vivid colors and collage. Although Otra Figuración were contemporaries of Nueva Presencia, there was no direct contact between the two groups. People who are sometimes associated with the group are Raquel Forner, Antonio Berni, Alberto Heredia, and Antonio Seguí.\n\nThe French poet and founder of Surrealism, André Breton, after visiting Mexico in 1938, proclaimed it to be \"the surrealist country par excellence.\" Surrealism, an artistic movement originating in post-World War I Europe, strongly impacted the art of Latin America. This is where the mestizo culture, the legacy of European conquer over indigenous peoples, embodies contradiction, a central value of Surrealism.\n\nThe widely known Mexican painter Frida Kahlo painted self-portraits and depictions of traditional Mexican culture in a style that combines Realism, Symbolism and Surrealism. Although, Kahlo did not commend this label, once saying, \"They thought I was a Surrealist, but I wasn't. I never painted dreams. I painted my own reality.\" Kahlo's work commands the highest selling price of all Latin American paintings, and the second-highest for any female artist. Other female Mexican Surrealists include Leonora Carrington (a British woman who relocated to Mexico) and Remedios Varo (a Spanish exile). Mexican artist Alberto Gironella, Chilean artists Roberto Matta, Mario Carreño Morales, and Nemesio Antúnez, Cuban artist Wifredo Lam, and Argentinean artist Roberto Aizenberg have also been classified as Surrealists.\n\nEuropean classical art styles have made a long-lasting impression on the art of Latin America. Into the twentieth century, many Latin American artists continued to be schooled in the traditional 19th-century style, resulting in a continued emphasis on figurative work. Due to the far reach of figuration, the work often spans upon a number of different styles such as Realism, Pop art, Expressionism, and Surrealism, only naming a few. While these artists confront issues that range from the personal to the political, many have a shared interest in indigenous issues and the heritage of European cultural imperialism.\n\nArt in Latin America has often been used as a means of social and political critique. Mexican graphic artist José Guadalupe Posada drew harsh images of Mexican elites as skeletons, calaveras. This was done prior to the Mexican Revolution, strongly influencing later artists, such as Diego Rivera.\nA common practice among Latin American figurative artists is to parody Old Master paintings, especially those of the Spanish court produced by Diego Velázquez in the 17th century. These parodies serve a dual purpose, referring to the artistic and cultural history of Latin America, and critiquing the legacy of European cultural imperialism in Latin American nations. Two notable artists who frequently employed this technique are Fernando Botero and Alberto Gironella.\n\nColombian figurative artist Fernando Botero, whose work features unique \"puffy\" figures in various situations addressing themes of power, war, and social issues, has used this technique to draw parallels between current governing bodies and the Spanish monarchy. His 1967 painting \"The Presidential Family\", is an early example. The painting, echoing Diego Velázquez's 1656 Spanish court painting \"Las Meninas\" (The Maids of Honor), contains a self-portrait of Botero standing behind a large canvas. The thick, \"puffy\" presidential family, decked out in fashionable finery and staring blandly out of the canvas, appear socially superior, drawing attention to social inequality. According to Botero, his \"puffy\" figures are not meant to be satirical. He painted a powerful series of canvases, which are based on photos of torture by the U.S. military of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison.\n\nMexican painter and collagist Alberto Gironella, whose style mixes elements of Surrealism and Pop art, also produced parodies of official Spanish court paintings. He completed dozens of versions of Velásquez's \"Queen Mariana\" from 1652. Gironella's parodies critique the Spanish rule of Mexico by incorporating subversive imagery. ‘’La Reina de los Yugos’’ or \"The Queen of Yokes\" (1975–81) depicts Mariana with a skirt made of upside-down ox yokes, signifying both Spanish dominance over Mexico's indigenous peoples, and those people's subversion of Spanish rule. The yokes are rendered useless by being upturned. \"[Gironella's] hallmark was the use of particular Spanish Grocery cans (sardines, mussels, etc.) in his works, and soda bottle caps nailed or glued around the rim of his paintings.\"\n\nPhotographers captured on film, indigenous peoples as well as distinct social types, such as the gauchos of Argentina. A number of Latin Americans have made significant contributions to modern photography. Guillermo Kahlo photographed Mexican colonial buildings and infrastructure, such as the railway bridge at Metlac. Agustín Casasola himself took many images of the Mexican Revolution, and compiled an extensive archive of Mexican photos. Other photographers include indigenous Peruvian Martín Chambi, Mexican Graciela Iturbide, and Cuban Alberto Korda, famous for his iconic image of Che Guevara. Mario Testino is a noted fashion photographer. In addition, a number of non-Latin American photographers have focused on the area, including Tina Modotti and Edward Weston in Mexico. Guatemalan national María Cristina Orive has worked in Argentina with Sara Facio. Ecuadoran Hugo Cifuentes has garnered attention.\n\n"}

Lewis posthumously published in 1964. The book takes the form of a series of letters to a fictional friend, \"Malcolm\", in which Lewis meditates on prayer as an intimate dialogue between man and God. Beginning with a discussion of \"corporate prayer\" and the liturgical service, Lewis goes on to consider practical and metaphysical aspects of private prayer, such as when to pray and where, ready-made prayer, petitionary prayer, prayer as worship, penitential prayer, and prayer for the dead. The concluding letter discusses \"liberal\" Christians, the soul and resurrection.\n\n\"Letters to Malcolm\" is generally thought to be one of Lewis's less successful books and differs from his other books on Christianity in that it poses a number of questions which Lewis does not attempt to answer. Lewis moreover shows a reluctance to be as critical of radical theologians such as Alec Vidler and John Robinson as his imaginary friend Malcolm wants him to be.\n"}

Lippard\n\nLucy Lippard (born April 14, 1937) is an American writer, art critic, activist and curator. Lippard was among the first writers to recognize the \"dematerialization\" at work in conceptual art and was an early champion of feminist art. She is the author of 21 books on contemporary art and has received numerous awards and accolades from literary critics and art associations.\n\nLucy Lippard was born in New York City and lived in New Orleans and Charlottesville, Virginia, before enrolling at Abbot Academy in 1952. She attended Smith College and earned a B.A. in 1958. In 1962, she earned an M.A. degree in art history from the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University.\n\nJust out of college, Lippard began working in the library at the Museum of Modern Art in 1958 where, in addition to reshelving the library after a fire, she was \"farmed out\" to do research for curators. She credits these years of working at MoMA paging, filing and researching as preparing her \"well for the archival, informational aspect of conceptual art.\" At MoMA she worked with curators such as Bill Lieberman, Bill Seitz and Peter Selz. By 1966, she had curated two traveling exhibitions for MoMA, one on \"soft sculpture\" and one on Max Ernst, as well as worked with Kynaston McShine on \"Primary Structures\" before he was hired by the Jewish Museum, taking the show with him. It was at MoMA that Lippard met Sol LeWitt who was working the night desk; John Button, Dan Flavin, Al Held, and Robert Ryman all held positions at the museum during this time as well.\n\nSince 1966, Lippard has published 20 books—including one novel—on feminism, art, politics and place. She has received numerous awards and accolades from literary critics and art associations. A 2012 exhibition on her seminal book, \"Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object\" at the Brooklyn Museum, titled \"\"Six Years\": Lucy R. Lippard and the Emergence of Conceptual Art\"\", cites Lippard's scholarship as its point of entry into a discussion about conceptual art during its era of emergence, demonstrating her crucial role in the contemporary understanding of this period of art production and criticism. Her research on the move toward Dematerialization in art making has formed a cornerstone of contemporary art scholarship and discourse. Lucy Lippard was a member of the populist political artist group known as the Art Workers Coalition, or AWC. Her involvement in the AWC as well as a trip she took to Argentina—such trips bolstered the political motivations of many feminists of the time—influenced a change in the focus of her criticism, from formalist subjects to more feministic ones.\n\nCo-founder of Printed Matter, Inc (an art bookstore in New York City centered on artist's books), the Heresies Collective, Political Art Documentation/Distribution (PAD/D), Artists Call Against U.S. Intervention in Central America, and other artists' organizations, she has also curated over 50 exhibitions, done performances, comics, guerrilla theater, and edited several independent publications the latest of which is the decidedly local \"La Puente de Galisteo\" in her home community in Galisteo, New Mexico. She has infused aesthetics with politics, and disdained disinterestedness for ethical activism.\n\nLippard holds nine honorary doctorates of fine arts, of which some are listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Unlike Hammerstein’s first roof garden theatre, which crowned his failed Olympia Theatre, the Paradise Roof Garden was able to rise to prominence and contend with its rivals for the better parts of two decades. For New York City theatre-goers, the name \"Hammerstein’s\" grew to encompass both the Victoria and its roof garden.\nFrom 1904 to 1914 it was run by Willie Hammerstein, who put on highly popular vaudeville acts.\n\nThe construction of the Victoria suffered from an anemic budget, and as a result, its roof garden developed incrementally. It opened in 1899 as the Venetian Terrace Roof Garden and featured a “‘grand promenade’ in the style of Monte Carlo.” The middle of its three tiers consisted of boxes; the third, an open-air café. In compliance with the city’s building code, Hammerstein added eight exits and two elevators to his “solid steel and concrete construction” before summer season of 1902 commenced. He also gained permission to install a roof that could open or close to accommodate the weather.\n\nThe bulk of the theatre rested over the Victoria, leaving the roof of the Belasco free for novelty features, including a pond, a Dutch-style dairy farm, and a windmill. The “Mute Revue” consisted of garden displays that paid tribute to the theatrical hits of the closing season. Just in time for the opening of the summer season of 1907, the entire venue was upgraded: the house was repainted in white and blue with splashes of red, and the boxes were remodeled and decked with geraniums.\n\nIn addition to entertainment, the open-air Paradise Roof Garden offered patrons escape from the city’s oppressive summer heat. The table-and-chair seating configuration encouraged conversation in a house that was vulnerable to sunlight and outside noise; simple, wordless variety entertainment was well suited to such conditions. Some of the “dumb acts” that played on the roof included Barnold’s Dog and Monkey Pantomime Company, and wire-walker Bird Millman; in fact, William Glackens’s painting, titled simply \"Hammerstein’s Roof Garden\", depicts such an act.\n\nAs advancements in air-conditioning were rendering New York’s roof garden theatres obsolete, silent movies were luring patrons out of vaudeville theatres. With the selling of the Victoria in 1915, the roof garden closed as well.\n"}

The goal of the book is not merely to introduce the history of formal thinking in western culture, but also to provide students with practical approaches and tools for dealing with some of the enduring questions as they manifest in everyday life. Thus the book focuses on this \"big picture\" and the interdisciplinary origins of philosophical thinking. He thus addresses the concerns that most people \"wonder\" about: Does life have meaning? Does God exist? How do you know right from wrong? and so on. The presentation is interwoven with cartoons, quotations, and related findings from the social and physical sciences that ensure central philosophical concepts are accessible. New learning objectives in this edition further strengthen the book's reader-friendly approach. An eclectic range of topics reinforces the author's presentation of philosophy as the individual's attempt to unify disparate world views, with interspersed biographies that provide glimpses into the lives of great thinkers who have molded the Western philosophical tradition and largely influenced how society thinks today.\n\nIt has many editions published from 1973-2008.\n\n\n1.

Done in oil on canvas, the portrait depicts the abstract figure of an Imperial German officer as being composed entirely of military decorations and badges of rank. The painting is currently on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\n\"Portrait of a German Officer\" was painted by American painter Marsden Hartley in late 1914 while he was living in the German imperial capital of Berlin. While in Germany, Hartley was greatly effected by the pageantry and discipline of the German army, with this interest eventually manifesting itself in some of his works. \"Portrait of a German Officer\" was intended to honor Karl von Freyburg, a German lieutenant who had died during the first few months of the First World War. It has been posited that Hartley's correspondence with Freyburg indicates that the former was romantically interested in the German officer.\n\nHartley's painting is highly sequential, symbolic, and heavily influenced by cubism and the school of German expressionism. The black, white, and red flag of the German Empire is placed in a prominent position in the bottom central portion of the image, while the Iron Cross (a decoration which Freyburg was awarded) is prominently featured in the top-center. The blue and white checkered flag of Freyburg's home state of Bavaria is also shown, as is an officer's white-striped epaulet. Hartly also included more personal details in the portrait; the number \"24\" represents Freyburg's age when he died, Freyburg's initials (K.v.F) are seen in gold-on-red, Freyburg's regimental number (4) can be seen in center of the portrait, and a spur (representing Freyburg's service as a cavalry officer) can be seen in the bottom right of the image. Hartfield also represented Germany's enemies during the war through his inclusion of the English Cross of St. George and the Belgian Tricolor, both seen at the bottom of the portrait. \n"}

It becomes clear that he fears returning to battle.\n\nWhen Miss Farnsworth indicates that McBurney is healthy enough and will have to leave the school in a few days, he tries to convince her to let him stay as a gardener, and tells Miss Morrow that he has fallen in love with her. One night, he tells Miss Morrow to await him in her room. When he does not appear and she hears strange noises, she investigates and finds him in bed with Alicia, a teenage pupil. McBurney tries to calm Miss Morrow down, but she pushes him away, causing him to fall down the stairs and badly break his already injured leg. Miss Farnsworth decides that the only way to stop him from dying is to amputate the leg.\n\nWhen he awakes the next day and realizes he has lost his leg, McBurney is devastated and furious, accusing the women (and especially Miss Farnsworth) of having punished him for not choosing their rooms instead of Alicia's. He is locked up in his room but threatens Alicia, who gets him the room key. He then breaks out, steals a gun, and threatens the women before storming off. Miss Morrow follows him to his room, where they have passionate sex.\n\nMeanwhile Miss Farnsworth tries to find a solution. One of the students suggests killing McBurney by preparing him a dinner of poisonous mushrooms, to which Miss Farnsworth agrees. During the dinner, Miss Morrow, who is not informed of the plan, is deterred by the others at the last minute from putting the mushrooms on her own plate. McBurney's suspicions are not aroused; he eats the mushrooms. Seconds later, he falls to the floor, in the throes of death. While the others are sewing McBurney's body into a shroud, Miss Morrow looks on, devastated. The film ends with the women dragging McBurney's body to the road so that he will be found by the next Confederate soldiers who pass by.\n\nCoppola had initially expressed an aversion to a remake, but after watching the 1971 version at the urging of production designer Anne Rose, she was left contemplating ways she could update the film. Specifically, she became interested in showing the story from the women's point of view, as opposed to the man's. The material came to Coppola at a time when she wanted to make a more optimistic film than 2013's \"The Bling Ring\", stating that she wanted to \"cleanse myself\" from what she terms was \"such a tacky, ugly world\".\n\nIn March 2016, it was announced that Elle Fanning, Nicole Kidman, and Kirsten Dunst had been cast in the film, while Colin Farrell entered talks that July. The music for the film was composed by the rock band Phoenix (whose lead singer, Thomas Mars, is married to Coppola). Two popular Civil War ballads, \"Lorena\" and \"Aura Lea\", were used in the film, in addition to Stephen Foster's \"Virginia Belle\". Most of the costumes in the film were designed by Stacey Battat, who used the costume and fabric archives of the Metropolitan Museum of Art to gain inspiration for contemporary fashion. Corsets were made for each actress, while for historical accuracy only cotton fabric was used, which was in turn either stone washed or enzyme washed to weather the fabrics and make them look worn in.\n\nPrincipal photography began on October 31, 2016 and concluded on December 7, 2016. Exterior scenes were shot on the grounds of the Madewood Plantation House, near Napoleonville, Louisiana. Interiors were filmed in actress Jennifer Coolidge's house in New Orleans.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival; Coppola won the Best Director Award, making her the second woman to ever win in that category, 56 years after the first female director won. The film began a limited release on June 23, 2017, before expanding to a wide release on June 30, 2017.\n\n\"The Beguiled\" grossed $10.6 million in the United States and Canada and $16.1 million in other territories for a total of $26.7 million.\n\nIn the film's limited opening weekend, it made $240,545 from four theaters (a per-theater gross of $60,136), finishing 20th at the box office. In its wide opening, it made $3.2 million from 674 theaters (an average of $4,694), finishing 8th at the box office.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 78% based on 281 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"The Beguiled\" adds just enough extra depth to its source material to set itself apart, and director Sofia Coppola's restrained touch is enlivened by strong performances from the cast.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 77 out of 100, based on 45 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nDavid Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film an \"A−\", saying, \"Coppola's film is told with surgical precision and savage grace.\" Todd McCarthy of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" stated: \"Other than to place slightly more emphasis on the female empowerment angle...it's hard to detect a strong raison d'etre behind Sofia Coppola's slow-to-develop melodrama.\"\n\nThe 1966 novel had a black female slave as a supporting character, whom director Sofia Coppola removed from the film, and for a biracial character from the novel, she cast white actress Kirsten Dunst. \"The Guardian\" said Coppola was criticized for engaging in whitewashing, to which the director said she made the changes so as \"not [to] brush over such an important topic in a light way,\" and that \"[y]oung girls watch my films and this was not the depiction of an African American character I would want to show them.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "23650559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23650559", "title": "The Falcon, Chester", "text": "The Falcon, Chester\n\nThe Falcon is a public house in Chester, Cheshire, England. It stands on the west side of Lower Bridge Street at its junction with Grosvenor Road. The Falcon is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. The building formerly incorporated part of Chester Rows, but it was the first building to have its portion of the row enclosed in the 17th century.\n\nThe building originated as a house in about 1200 and was later extended to the south along Lower Bridge Street, with a great hall running parallel to the street. During the 13th century it was rebuilt to incorporate its portion of the row. It was rebuilt again during the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The house was bought in 1602 by Sir Richard Grosvenor who extensively altered it some 40 years later to make it his town house. During the Civil War he moved his family here from his country home, Eaton Hall. In 1643 Sir Richard petitioned the City Assembly for leave to enlarge his house by enclosing the portion of the row which passed through his property. This was successful and it set a precedent for other residents of Lower Bridge Street to enclose their portion of the rows, or to build new structures which did not incorporate the rows.\n\nIn the late 18th century the building ceased to be the town house of the Grosvenor family. It continued to be owned by them, and between 1778 and 1878 it was licensed as \"The Falcon Inn\". In about 1879 alterations were made by John Douglas. At this time it was known as \"The Falcon Cocoa House\" and it was re-opened as a temperance house. In 1886 Grayson and Ould carried out a restoration. By the 1970s the building had become virtually derelict. In 1979 the Falcon Trust was established, and the building was donated to the trust by the Grosvenor Estate. Between 1979 and 1982 the building was restored and in 1983 it won a Europa Nostra award. The building was donated to the Falcon Trust by the Grosvenor Estate, and was reopened by the Duke of Westminster in May 1992.\n\nThe east face of The Falcon is on Lower Bridge Street and the north face on Grosvenor Road. The east face has two storeys on a sandstone plinth with two gables. Most of the sandstone is rendered. To the left is a staircase of nine steps leading from the street to the lower storey, which is the level of the enclosed row. The lower storey has close timber studding and an eleven-light leaded window. Above this is a row of twelve quatrefoil panels which slope slightly outwards over which is a continuous 34-light leaded window. The two gables are carried on brackets which curve outwards, and have herringbone struts, moulded bargeboards and shaped finials.\n\nThe north face give the appearance of two buildings. The older part is to the left (east) and the newer right (west) part was possibly added by Sir Richard Grosvenor in 1626. The eastern portion is a continuation of the east front. The street level and the lower storey are in sandstone, partly rendered, some of which has been replaced by brick. The upper storey has a window of six lights, which are continuous with those on the east face and two quatrefoils above. To the right of these is timber framing and a window. Above is a grey slate roof and a lateral shaped chimney in brick. The western portion has a rendered plinth with timber framing above. On the lower storey is a door and two windows, one with seven lights and the other with four. The upper storey has similar windows, plus a one-light window over the door.\n\nThe medieval undercroft is used as the beer cellar. It was originally a single three-bay chamber but has been divided by a brick wall into a two-bay north chamber and a single-bay south chamber. In the cellar are two octagonal stone piers and a massive central east-west oak beam. On the level of the row is a room along the east side, which is the enclosed portion of the row, and two rooms behind, with a further room in the west wing.\n\n"}
{"id": "34887669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34887669", "title": "The Source (Ingres)", "text": "The Source (Ingres)\n\nThe Source () is an oil painting on canvas by French neoclassical painter Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres. The work was begun in Florence around 1820 and not completed until 1856, in Paris. When Ingres completed \"The Source\", he was seventy-six years old, already famous, and president of the École des Beaux-Arts. The pose of the nude may be compared with that of another by Ingres, the \"Venus Anadyomene\" (1848), and is a reimagination of the Aphrodite of Cnidus or \"Venus Pudica\". Two of Ingres' students, painters Paul Balze and Alexandre Desgoffe, helped to create the background and water jar.\n\nThe painting depicts a nude standing upright between an opening in the rocks and holding in her hands a pitcher, from which water flows. She thus represents a water source or spring which, in classical literature, is sacred to the Muses and a source of poetic inspiration. She stands between two flowers, with their \"vulnerability to males who wish to pluck them\", and is framed by ivy, plant of Dionysus the god of disorder, regeneration, and ecstasy. The water she pours out separates her from the viewer, as rivers mark boundaries of which the crossing is symbolically important.\nArt historians Frances Fowle and Richard Thomson suggest that there is a \"symbolic unity of woman and nature\" in \"The Source\", where the flowering plants and water serve as a background which Ingres fills with woman's \"secondary attributes\".\n\nThe first exhibition of \"The Source\" was in 1856, the year it was completed. The painting was received enthusiastically. Duchâtel acquired the painting in 1857 for a sum of 25,000 francs. The state assumed title to the painting in 1878 and it passed to the Musée du Louvre. In 1986 it was transferred to the Musée d'Orsay. The painting has been frequently exhibited and widely published.\n\nHaldane Macfall in \"A History of Painting: The French Genius\" describes \"The Source\" as Ingres' \"superb nude by which he is chiefly known\". Kenneth Clark in his book \"Feminine Beauty\" observed how \"The Source\" has been described as \"the most beautiful figure in French painting.\" Walter Friedländer in \"David to Delacroix\" referred to \"The Source\" simply as the most famous of Ingres' paintings.\n\nThe model for the painting was the young daughter of Ingres' concierge. In his \"Confessions of a Young Man\", Irish novelist George Moore wrote, with relation to the morality of artistic production, \"What care I that the virtue of some sixteen-year-old maid was the price for Ingres' \"La Source\"? That the model died of drink and disease in the hospital is nothing when compared with the essential that I should have \"La Source\", that exquisite dream of innocence.\"\n"}
{"id": "41075299", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41075299", "title": "Theory and History", "text": "Theory and History\n\nTheory and History: An Interpretation of Social and Economic Evolution is a treatise by Austrian school economist and philosopher Ludwig von Mises. It can be thought of as a continuation in the development of the Misesian system of social science. In particular, it provides further epistemological support for his earlier works, esp. Human Action. Most notably, Mises elaborates on methodological dualism, develops the concept of thymology – a historical branch of the sciences of human action – and presents his critique of Marxist materialism.\n\nFurthermore, Mises puts forward a theory of knowledge and value. He later explores and critically analyzes paradigms of thought like determinism, materialism, dialectic materialism, historicism, scientism, positivism, behaviorism and psychology. He argues that these schools of thought – some politically motivated, others blinded by dogmatism – have committed epistemological and methodological blunders and are not conducive to a scientific understanding of human behavior.\n\nEconomist Murray Rothbard considered \"Theory and History\" to be Mises's most overlooked work.\n\nMises presents the book in four parts.\n\nIntroduction and Part One – Value:\n\nThe first part sets the overall theme of the book with Mises introducing the concept of methodological dualism. He then expounds a theory of value that is central throughout. Regarding his view on science – as systematic body of knowledge, of both natural and social phenomena – as a means to successful action in the world, Mises argues that in order to properly understand human behavior we must attribute – as a methodological resort – volition and purpose to human behaviour. Mises considers this the epistemological and methodological basis of the sciences of human action. The branch that deals with the logical implications of action as such is called praxeology.\n\nPart Two – Determinism and Materialism:\n\nIn the second part, Mises weighs in on the free will vs. determinism controversy and comments that the long historical debates did little to settle the problems at hand. He argues that while the natural sciences, in discovering scientific laws, must presuppose a strict regularity in the occurrence of causes and effects, i.e. determinism, such a presupposition cannot be held in the case of human action. He argues further that the social sciences must take thoughts, ideas, and judgments of value as ultimately given in the analysis of human action. Our ignorance of the origins and causes of these phenomena, Mises argues, forces us – at least for the time being – to adopt a dualistic approach. He contends that attempts to find the origins and causes of these phenomena are vain, as is the task of all varieties of materialism. Mises then turns his attention to the doctrine of materialism, more specifically, that of Marxist dialectical materialism.\n\nPart Three – Epistemological Problems of History:\n\nThe third part deals with the logical and epistemological problems of historical analysis. Mises explains the individualistic character of historical human events. He argues that the historian must ultimately face – when tracing back the causal factors behind past human action – a point at which no further reduction is possible, i.e. the ideas and actions of individuals. This, he claims, is the \"ultimate given of history\". In spite of the individuality of historical events, Mises still insists there are general laws of human behaviour but that they are praxeological laws, i.e. a priori, not historical laws, i.e. a posteriori. However, historicism, according to Mises, claimed there were no general laws – especially economic laws – of human behavior. Mises then enters into a critique of historicism.\n\nMises also addresses the challenges of scientism in the context of social science, namely the application of positivism and behaviorism in the realm of human action. However, more noteworthy is Mises's presentation of thymology, a historical branch of the sciences of human action. Mises argues that thymology is what everybody resorts to when trying to \"understand\" and anticipate the historical and future actions of their fellow men, and is particularly useful to the historian. He then expounds the scope of thymology and its relation to praxeology.\n\nPart Four – The Course of History:\n\nIn the final part of his treatise, Mises dissects and critiques various speculations and interpretations of history, including a common interpretation of modern Western civilization. He also comments on his observation regarding society's move away from classical liberalism, freedom, and capitalism towards socialism and totalitarianism. Moreover, Mises notes the rising ideology of wealth and income equality and speculates on its origins. He argues that rising anti-capitalistic ideology is fostering a present trend toward the impoverishment of society. He criticizes the notion of society's inevitable \"trend toward progress\", and argues that the evolution of society and civilization is predicated – not on an automatic and inevitable path – but on the underlying ideology which can, at any time, change. To this point, Mises closes with some remarks on the uncertainty of the future and the neglect of ideological factors that can give rise to civilization but also stamp it out.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "35552352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35552352", "title": "Women in architecture", "text": "Women in architecture\n\nWomen in architecture have been documented for many centuries, as professional (or amateur) practitioners, educators and clients. Since architecture became organized as a profession in 1857, the number of women in architecture has been low. At the end of the 19th century, starting in Finland, certain schools of architecture in Europe began to admit women to their programmes of study. In 1980 \nM. Rosaria Piomelli, born in Italy, became the first woman to hold a deanship of any school of architecture in the United States, as Dean of the City College of New York School of Architecture. However, only in recent years have women begun to achieve wider recognition with several outstanding participants including two Pritzker prizewinners since the turn of the millennium.\n\nTwo European women stand out as early examples of women playing an important part in architecture, designing or defining the development of buildings under construction. In France, Katherine Briçonnet (ca. 1494–1526) was influential in designing the Château de Chenonceau in the Loire Valley, supervising the construction work between 1513 and 1521 and taking important architectural decisions while her husband was away fighting in the Italian wars.\n\nIn Britain, there is evidence that Lady Elizabeth Wilbraham (1632–1705) studied the work of the Dutch architect Pieter Post as well as that of Palladio in Veneto, Italy, and the Stadtresidenz at Landshut, Germany. She has been put forward as the architect of Wotton House in Buckinghamshire and of many other buildings. It has also been suggested that she tutored Sir Christopher Wren. Wilbraham had to use male architects to supervise the construction work. There is now much research including that by John Millar to show she may have designed up to 400 buildings including 18 London churches previously attributed to her pupil Sir Christopher Wren.\n\nTowards the end of the 18th century, another Englishwoman, Mary Townley (1753–1839), tutored by the artist Sir Joshua Reynolds, designed several buildings in Ramsgate in south-eastern England including Townley House which is considered to be an architectural gem. Sarah Losh (1785-1853) was an English woman and landowner of Wreay. She has been described as a lost Romantic genius, antiquarian, architect and visionary. Her main work is St Mary's Church (Wreay), Cumbria, but she also constructed various associated buildings and monuments.\n\nYet another Englishwoman, Sophy Gray (1814–1871), wife of Robert Gray who became bishop of Cape Town in 1847, proved to be a competent assistant, not only helping her husband with his administrative and social obligations but above all by designing at least 35 of the South African Anglican churches completed between 1848 and 1880, all in the Gothic Revival style in which she showed strong interest.\n\nThe daughter of a French-Canadian carriage maker, Mother Joseph Pariseau (1823–1902) was not just one of the very earliest female architects in North America but a pioneer in the architecture of the north-western United States. In 1856, together with four sisters from Montreal, she moved to Vancouver, Washington where she designed eleven hospitals, seven academies, five schools for Native American children, and two orphanages in an area encompassing today's Washington State, northern Oregon, Idaho, and Montana.\n\nLouise Blanchard Bethune (1856–1913) from Waterloo, New York, was the first American woman known to have worked as a professional architect. In 1876, she took a job working as a draftsman in the office of Richard A. Waite and F.W. Caulkings in Buffalo, New York where she worked for five years, demonstrating she could hold her own in what was a masculine profession. In 1881, she opened an independent office partnered with her husband Robert Bethune in Buffalo, earning herself the title as the nation's first professional woman architect. She was named the first female associate of the American Institute of Architects (A.I.A.) in 1888 and in 1889, she became its first female fellow.\n\nAnother early practicing architect in the United States was Emily Williams (1869–1942) from northern California. In 1901, together with her friend Lillian Palmer, she moved to San Francisco where she studied drafting at the California High School of Mechanical Arts. Encouraged by Palmer, she went on to build a number of cottages and houses in the area, including a family home on 1037 Broadway in San Francisco, now a listed building.\n\nTheodate Pope Riddle (1868–1946) grew up in a well-to-do background in Farmington, Connecticut, where she hired faculty members to tutor her in architecture. Her early designs, such as that for Hill-Stead (1901), were translated into working drawings by the firm of McKim, Mead and White, providing her with an apprenticeship in architecture. She was the first woman to become a licensed architect in both New York and Connecticut and in 1926 was appointed to the AIA College of Fellows.\n\nA notable pioneer of the early days was Josephine Wright Chapman (1867–1943). Chapman received no formal education in architecture but went on design a number of buildings before setting up her own firm. The architect of Tuckerman Hall in Worcester, Massachusetts, she is considered to be one of America's earliest and most successful female architects.\n\nRomanian architect Virginia Andreescu Haret (1894–1962), first woman to graduate with a degree in architecture in 1919 and first woman as Romanian Architectural Inspector General. She continued her studies in Italy. \nShe worked at the Technical Service of the Ministry of Education, for which reason she did numerous and important projects for schools, in Bucharest (Şincai and Cantemir Lyceum) as well as in the country (Bârlad, Focşani). Side by side with buildings of large dimensions, she also designed houses for one or two persons. The mobility did not stop at the studies in Italy, she was present also at numerous congresses of architecture in Rome, Paris, Moscow, Bruxelles ...\n\nA highly influential player was Mary Colter (1869–1958). After studying at the California School of Design in San Francisco, she was employed by the Fred Harvey Company, first for interior design but soon to take on ambitious architectural projects, including landmark hotels and Rustic lodges in the Southwest, several in Grand Canyon National Park. She often used Native American motifs (and artisans) while blending the regional Spanish Colonial Revival Style and Pueblo Revival Style, but she also was fluent in Art Deco and even Streamline Moderne.\n\nRuth Crawford Mitchell an advocate for student immigrants at the University of Pittsburgh, conceived, designed and supervised the Nationality Rooms in the Cathedral of Learning.\n\nElizabeth Wright Ingraham (1922-2013), daughter of John Lloyd Wright and granddaughter of Frank Lloyd Wright, designed approximately 150 buildings in Colorado Springs.\n\nFinland is the country in which women were first permitted to undertake architectural studies and receive academic qualifications even if they were initially given the status of special students. The earliest record belongs to Signe Hornborg (1862–1916) who attended the Helsinki Polytechnic Institute from the spring of 1888, graduating as an architect in 1890 \"by special permission\". She does not, however, appear to have acted as an independent architect. Other graduates in architecture at the Polytechnic Institute in the 1880s include Inez Holming, Signe Lagerborg, Bertha Enwald, Stina Östman and Wivi Lönn. Lönn (1872–1966), who attended the institute from 1893 to 1896, has the honour of being the first woman to work independently as an architect in Finland. On graduating, she immediately established her own architectural firm by receiving a commission to design the building of a Finnish-language girls' school in Tampere. She designed several significant public buildings, including more than thirty school buildings. Lönn won five architectural competitions alone, including the municipal fire-station in Tampere in 1906, an unusual design for a woman at that time. Lönn won two competitions with Armas Lindgren with him she designed the New Student House in Helsinki (1910) and the Estonia Theatre in Tallinn (1913). One of her last was the Sodankylä Geophysical Observatory, completed in 1945. Hilda Hongell (1867–1952), from Finland's Åland Islands, became a special student at Helsinki Industrial School in 1891 at a time when only men could attend the institution. Following excellent results, she was accepted as a regular student the following year and graduated as a \"master builder\" in 1894. She went on to design 98 buildings in the Mariehamn district of the Åland Islands, mostly town houses and farm houses in the ornamental Swiss style. However, she did not qualify as an architect.\n\nFay Kellogg (1871–1918) learnt her architectural skills with a German tutor who taught her drafting, at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, and by working with Marcel de Monclos in his Paris atelier. She had hoped to study at the École des Beaux-Arts but as a woman was refused admission. As a result of her efforts, however, the institution later opened its doors to women wishing to study architecture. On her return to the United States, Kellogg helped design the Hall of Records in Lower Manhattan before opening a studio of her own. She went on to design hundreds of buildings in the New York area, encouraging the New York Times to describe her as \"one of the most successful woman architects in America\". Julia Morgan (1872–1957) was more successful as she was the first woman to receive a degree in architecture from the École des Beaux-Arts. She was initially refused admission as a woman in 1896 but reapplied and was successfully admitted in 1898. After graduating in 1901, she returned to California where she had a prolific and innovative career, blazing new paths professionally, stylistically, structurally, and aeshetically, setting high standards of excellence in the profession. Completing over 700 projects, she is especially known for her work for women's organizations and key clients, including Hearst Castle in San Simeon, considered to be one of her masterpieces. She was the first woman architect licensed in California. Mary Rockwell Hook (1877–1978) from Kansas also traveled to study architecture at the École des Beaux-Arts where she suffered from discrimination against women after sitting for examinations. She was not successful in gaining admittance, and returned to America in 1906, where she did practice architecture. She designed the Pine Mountain Settlement School in Kentucky as well as a number of buildings in Kansas City where she was the first architect to incorporate the natural terrain into her designs and the first to use cast-in-place concrete walls.\n\nFlorence Mary Taylor (1879–1969) emigrated at an early age from England to Australia with her parents. She enrolled in night classes at the Sydney Technical College where she became the first woman to complete final year studies in architecture in 1904. She went on to work in the busy office of John Burcham Clamp, where she became chief draftsperson. In 1907, with Clamp's support, she applied to become the first female member of the Institute of Architects of New South Wales but faced considerable opposition, only being invited to join in 1920.\n\nIsabel Roberts (1871–1955), born in Missouri, studied architecture in New York City at the Masqueray-Chambers Atelier, established by Emmanuel Louis Masqueray along the lines of the French École des Beaux-Arts. It was the first studio in the United States specifically established to teach the practice of architecture. Convinced of the abilities of women as architects. Masqueray was keen to include them among his students. Roberts became a member of Frank Lloyd Wright's design team before partnering with Ida Annah Ryan (1873–1950), in Orlando, Florida. Ryan was the first woman to earn a master's degree in architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology although Sophia Hayden Bennett (1868–1953) had graduated in architecture there in 1890.\n\nEsther Marjorie Hill was the first woman to graduate from a Canadian architecture school, in 1920.\n\nAfter Finland, several other European countries allowed women to study architecture. In Norway, the first female architect was Lilla Hansen (1872–1962) who studied at the Royal Drafting School (\"Den Kongelige Tegneskole\") in Kristiania (1894) and served architectural apprenticeships in Brussels, Kristiania and Copenhagen. She established her own practice in 1912 and gained immediate success with Heftyeterrassen, a Neo-baroque residential complex in Oslo. She went on to design a number of large villas as well as student accommodation for women.\n\nThe first woman to run an architecture practice in Germany was Emilie Winkelmann (1875−1951). She studied architecture as a guest student registered as Student Emil at the College of Technology in Hanover (1902–1908) but was refused a diploma as women were not entitled to the qualification until 1909. Working from her practice in Berlin where she employed a staff of 15, she completed some 30 villas before the outbreak of war. One of her most notable buildings is the Tribüne theatre in Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf, originally a girls school.\n\nThe first woman to become an engineer in Germany was Serbian architect Jovanka Bončić-Katerinić. She received her degree from the Technical University of Darmstadt in 1913. \n\nIn Serbia, Jelisaveta Načić (1878–1955) studied architecture at the University of Belgrade at a time when it was felt that women should not enter the profession. At the age of 22, she was the first woman to graduate from the Faculty of Engineering. As a woman, she was unable to obtain the ministerial post she sought but gained employment with the Municipality of Belgrade where she became chief architect. Among her notable achievements are the well-proportioned Kralj Petar I (King Peter I) elementary school (1906) and the Moravian-styled Alexander Nevsky Church (1929), both in Belgrade. The first female architect in Serbia, she did much to inspire other women to enter the profession.\n\nMargarete Schütte-Lihotzky (1897–2000) was the first female architect in Austria and the first woman to graduate from the Vienna Kunstgewerbeschule, now the University of Applied Arts Vienna, though she was admitted only after a letter of recommendation from an influential friend. A pioneer of social housing development in Vienna and Frankfurt, she combined design with functionality, especially in her Frankfurt Kitchen, the prototype of today's built-in kitchen.\n\nIn Switzerland, Flora Steiger-Crawford (1899–1991) was the first woman to graduate in architecture from Zurich's Federal Institute of Technology in 1923. She established her own firm with her husband Rudolf Steiger in 1924. Their first project, the Sandreuter House in Riehen (1924), is considered to be the first Modernist house in Switzerland. In 1938, she terminated her architectural activities in favour of sculpture.\n\nThe first woman to be admitted to Britain's Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) was Ethel Charles (1871–1962) in 1898. She and her sister Bessie were both trained as architects under the partnership of Ernest George and Harold Peto. In 1893, they both attempted to continue their training by attending the Architectural Association School of Architecture but were refused entry. Ethel completed part of the course offered by the Bartlett School of Architecture, receiving distinctions. As a woman, though, she was unable to obtain large-scale commissions and was forced to concentrate on modest housing projects such as labourers' cottages. Another early female architect in Britain was Edith Hughes (1888–1971), a Scot, who after attending lectures on art and architecture at the Sorbonne, studied at Gray's School of Art, Aberdeen, where she received a diploma in architecture in 1914. In addition to teaching at the Glasgow School of Art, she established her own practice in 1920, specializing in kitchen design. The first women to design a major building in Britain was Elisabeth Scott (1898–1972) who was the architect behind the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre at Stratford-upon-Avon completed in 1932.\n\nA number of the more important women architects in the first half of the 20th century partnered with men, often forming husband-and-wife practices. Such partnerships began in the early years of women's involvement when some of the most successful male architects worked with women. Since the 1960s, which saw increased enrollment by women into schools of Architecture, male and female students have often met and later married; long hours working together and a shared passion have been described as \"the perfect prescription for romance\". A good overview of this topic is also discussed in Ann Forsyth's \"In Praise of Zaha\" \n\nMale-female partnerships in architecture sometimes lead to misattribution of the work to the male partner, often because the male is better known. This can be seen as the result of an underlying discrimination or biased attitude. What has been described as the \"tradition of misattribution\" has remained a \"secret\" until recent years.\n\nSome particularly notable male-female partnerships in architecture include:\n\n\nSeveral women architects have had considerable success in recent years, gaining wide recognition for their achievements:\n\nIn 2004, the Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid became the first woman to be awarded the Pritzker Prize. Among her many projects, special mention was made of the Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art in Cincinnati and the BMW Central Building in Leipzig. When awarding the prize, the chairman of the jury, spoke of her \"unswerving commitment to modernism\" explaining how she had moved away from existing typology, from high-tech, shifting the geometry of buildings.\" Since 2004, she has completed many other notable works including the Guangzhou Opera House in Guangzhou, China, and the London Aquatics Centre for the 2012 Summer Olympics.\n\nIn 2010, another woman became a Pritzker Prize winner, Kazuyo Sejima from Japan, in partnership with Ryue Nishizawa. Lord Palumbo, the jury chairman, spoke of their architecture \"that is simultaneously delicate and powerful, precise and fluid, ingenious but not overly or overtly clever; for the creation of buildings that successfully interact with their contexts and the activities they contain, creating a sense of fullness and experiential richness.\" Special consideration had been given to the Glass Center at the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio, and the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa in Ishikawa, Japan.\n\nIn 2007 Anna Heringer (born 1977, Germany) won the Aga Khan Award for Architecture for her METI Handmade School built with bamboo and other local materials in Rudrapur, Bangladesh. An example of sustainable architecture, the project was praised not only for its simple, humane approach and beauty but also for the level of cooperation achieved between architects, craftsmen, clients and users. Several RIBA European Awards have been won in recent years by the Danish firm Lundgaard & Tranberg where Lene Tranberg (born 1956) has been a key architect. Projects have included the Royal Danish Playhouse (2008) and Tietgenkollegiet (2005).\n\nIn 2010, Sheila Sri Prakash was the first Indian Architect invited to serve on the World Economic Forum's Design Innovation Council, where she created the Reciprocal Design Index as a design tool for Holistically Sustainable Development. She is the first woman in India to have established her in own firm. In 1992, she was a pioneer of environmentally sustainable architecture and had designed a home with recycled material\n\nIn 2013, Women In Design, a student organization at the Harvard Graduate School of Design started a petition for the Pritzker Architecture Prize to recognize Denise Scott Brown who was not awarded in 1991, while her partner, Robert Venturi was. Also in 2013 Julia Morgan became the first woman to receive the AIA Gold Medal, which she received posthumously. In 2014 the Heydar Aliyev Cultural Centre, designed by Zaha Hadid, won the Design Museum Design of the Year Award, making her the first woman to win the top prize in that competition. In 2015 Hadid became the first woman to be awarded the RIBA Gold Medal in her own right.\n\nIn 2014 Parlour: women, equity, architecture published the Parlour Guides to Equitable Practice, which provide a practical resource for moving toward a more equitable profession, with a focus on gender equity.\n\nAlthough until recently their contributions have been largely unnoticed, women have in fact exerted a fair amount of influence on architecture over the past century. It was Susan Lawrence Dana, heiress to a mining fortune, who in 1902 chose to have her house in Springfield, Illinois, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, so ensuring his breakthrough. Women have also played a key role in historic preservation through organizations such as the Daughters of the American Revolution (1890). In 1985, Bulgarian architect Milka Bliznakov founded the International Archive of Women in Architecture to expand the availability of research materials concerning women in architecture. Recent studies also show that from the 1980s, women, as housewives and consumers, were instrumental in bringing new approaches to design, especially interiors, achieving a shift from architecture to space.\n\nA study on experience in Canada highlights the widespread contributions women have made in recent years, developing innovative approaches to practice and design. Women's significant and growing presence in the profession has attracted more attention than issues of marginalization.\n\nExhibitions presenting women's achievements in various fields provided early opportunities for women demonstrate their competence in designing pavilions. They included the 1893 exhibition in Chicago, where the women's pavilion was designed by Sophia Hayden, and two in 1914 in Germany: the Werkbund Exhibition in Cologne, whose \"Haus der Frau\" was designed by Lilly Reich, and the Burga Expo in Leipzig devoted to books and graphic art. Inspired by these successes, in 1928 Lux Guyer from Switzerland designed pavilions for SAFFA (\"Schweizerische Ausstellung für Frauenarbeit\") a fair exhibiting the accomplishments of women first held in Bern. The second SAFFA, held in Zurich in 1958, was put together by a team of 28 female architects, establishing architecture as a profession open to women in Switzerland.\n\nIt is not easy to find reliable statistics on women's place in architecture across the world. Much of the information is dated and some is based on surveys inviting responses but with no guarantee of comprehensive coverage.\n\nIn 2010, a survey conducted by the Architects' Council of Europe in 33 countries, found that there were 524,000 architects, of whom 31% were women. However the proportions differed widely from country to country. The countries with the highest proportion of female architects were Greece (57%), Croatia (56%), Bulgaria (50%), Slovenia (50%) and Sweden (49%) while those with the lowest were Slovakia (15%), Austria (16%), the Netherlands (19%), Germany (21%) and Belgium (24%). Over 200,000 of Europe's architects are in Italy or Germany where the proportions of women are 30% and 21% respectively.\n\nA study conducted in Australia in 2002 indicated that women comprise 43% of architecture students while their representation in the profession varied from 11.6% in Queensland to 18.2% in Victoria.\nMore recent Australian data, collected and analyzed as part of the Equity and Diversity in the Australian Architecture Profession research project, shows that whatever measure used women continue to disappear from the profession. Women have comprised over 40% of Australian architecture graduates for over two decades, but are only 20% of registered architects in Australia.\n\nIn 2016 only 21% of the architectural professionals registered in South Africa were women. A survey by the SA Institute of Architects Eastern Cape institute showed that in 2014 only 29% of architecture students graduating from Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University were women.\n\nA United Kingdom survey in 2000 stated that 13% of practising architects were women although women comprised 38% of students and 22% of teaching staff. Data from the Fees Bureau in November 2010 showed, however, that only 19% of professional architects were women, a drop of 5% since 2008.\n\nIn the United States, the National Architectural Accrediting Board reported in 2009 that 41% of architecture graduates were women while the AIA National Associates Committee Report from 2004 gives the percentage of licensed female architects as 20%. In 2003, an AIA Women in Architecture study found that women accounted for 27% of staff in U.S. architecture firms. The honorific FAIA was held by 174 women and 2,199 men, or roughly 8% in 2005.\n\n\n\n"}
