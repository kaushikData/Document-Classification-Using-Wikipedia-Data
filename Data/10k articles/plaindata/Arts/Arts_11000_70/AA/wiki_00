{"id": "47425203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47425203", "title": "20th Century Women", "text": "20th Century Women\n\n20th Century Women is a 2016 American comedy-drama film written and directed by Mike Mills and starring Annette Bening, Elle Fanning, Greta Gerwig, Lucas Jade Zumann and Billy Crudup. The film is set in 1970s Southern California and based in part on Mills' childhood.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the New York Film Festival on October 8, 2016, and was theatrically released on December 28, 2016, by A24. The film was nominated for two Golden Globe Awards, Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and Best Actress for Bening, as well as for Best Original Screenplay at the 89th Academy Awards.\n\nThe story is set in 1979, in a Santa Barbara, California boarding house. The semi-autobiographical protagonist is Jamie (Lucas Jade Zumann), a 15-year-old high school student. His mother, Dorothea (Annette Bening), a divorcee, runs the boarding house. Abbie (Greta Gerwig), a tenant, is a photographer, and is being treated for cervical cancer. William (Billy Crudup), another tenant, is a carpenter and mechanic, who lived on a hippie commune. Jamie's best friend is Julie (Elle Fanning), who often spends the night with Jamie but does not want to have sex with him because it would destroy their friendship.\n\nDorothea, concerned that she cannot connect with her son, asks Julie and Abbie to help raise him. When Jamie learns about his mother's plan, he runs away to Los Angeles with his friends to attend a rock concert. When Jamie returns from the show, Julie tells him that she had unprotected sex with a classmate and is worried that she is pregnant. Jamie buys a pregnancy test for Julie, which comes back negative. Jamie also offers Abbie moral support by accompanying her to her doctor's appointment, where Abbie learns that she is cancer-free, but will likely be unable to have children. To thank Jamie, Abbie tells him her life story: that she was forced to leave her friends in New York and return to Santa Barbara after her cancer diagnosis, brought on by her mother's use of fertility drug DES.\n\nOne day, Dorothea and Julie discuss the fact that Dorothea has only pursued relationships with \"safe\" men, as opposed to men she is truly attracted to, like William. Dorothea then asks Abbie to show her the modern world. At a punk club, William kisses Dorothea, but she rejects him on account of his sexual relationship with Abbie. When William does end the relationship with Abbie, Abbie warns Jamie and Julie that they must leave Santa Barbara if they want to succeed in life.\n\nLater, Abbie takes Jamie to a rock club where he gets drunk and kisses a girl. Meanwhile, Dorothea teaches William how to pursue a relationship with women, as opposed to seeking one night stands. When Abbie and Jamie return, Abbie shows Dorothea photographs she took of Jamie. Dorothea realizes that Jamie will never feel totally comfortable around her.\n\nJamie becomes curious about female sexuality, and Abbie lends him a book on gender inequality; when he reads it to Dorothea, she asks Abbie to stop teaching him about the feminist movement. The tension between Abbie and Dorothea comes to a head during a tenant dinner, where Abbie announces that she is menstruating. She grows angry at the tenants' discomfort and makes all of the men at the table say the word \"menstruation\". This inspires Julie to recount her first sexual encounter, which upsets Jamie. Jamie tells her that he no longer wants her to spend the night.\n\nJulie is hurt, but convinces Jamie to take a road trip along the California coastline. Jamie tells Julie that he loves her, but Julie says she cares about him too much to have sex. A fight ensues, during which Julie accuses him of only being nice to have sex with her, and Jamie disappears. By the time Dorothea, William and Abbie arrive to search for him, Jamie has returned. Jamie admits to Dorothea that he was hurt when she asked Abbie and Julie for help because it made her seem incapable of raising him. Dorothea tells Jamie about her relationship with Jamie's father.\n\nThe film ends with the main characters describing the rest of their lives in voice-overs. Julie moved to New York City to attend college, eventually losing touch with Jamie and Dorothea. She fell in love with a classmate and moved to Paris. They decided to not have children. Abbie stayed in Santa Barbara, marrying and starting a photography studio in her garage. Her photographs got displayed in local galleries. Against her doctor's advice, she conceived two boys by age 34. William lived with Dorothea for another year before moving to Arizona to open a pottery store and marrying twice. Dorothea met a man and stayed with him until her death in 1999 of cancer caused by her smoking. A few years after Dorothea's death, Jamie married and had a son. He tries to describe Dorothea to his son, but finds it to be impossible.\n\nMills took inspiration from his mother and sister to create the characters of Dorothea and Abbie, stating: \"It felt like I was raised by my mom and sisters, so I was always appealing to women in the punk scene or women in my world. I always leaned to them to figure out my life as a straight white guy. So I wanted to make a movie about that.” While the character of Jamie reflects his own experiences, Mills wrote the character of Julie based on the experiences of one of his friends. Mills has also described the film as a \"loveletter\" to the women who raised him, and though the film is autobiographical, he also noted that it is fictionalized, explaining, \"With all these characters, what guides me is the real person. Of course, I’m cinematizing real people, and you can never get them right or show all of their dimensions, but that’s very much what my mom was like.\" After finishing the script, Mills brought it to Annapurna Pictures, who signed onto the film after liking Mills's previous film \"Beginners\".\n\nIn May 2015, Annette Bening, Greta Gerwig, and Elle Fanning joined the cast, with Bening set to play a single mother, Gerwig a young sophisticated photographer, and Fanning a provocative friend of the single mother's teenage son. On August 3, 2015, Billy Crudup was cast in a supporting role.\n\nWhile preparing for their roles in the film, Bening watched films Mills's mother loved. The two also had extensive talks about Mills's mother. Gerwig prepared for her role by taking photography lessons, learning how to use a camera, listening to records, reading books, and watching films, and also spoke with Mills's sister, whom the character is based upon. Fanning was given \"The Road Less Traveled\" by M. Scott Peck to prepare.\n\nPrincipal photography on the film began on September 8, 2015 in Southern California, and production concluded on October 27, 2015. The film was shot over 35 days, with filming mainly taking place in Los Angeles, with exteriors shot in Santa Barbara.\n\nRoger Neill composed the film's score.\n\nIn June 2016, A24 acquired U.S distribution rights to the film. The film had its world premiere at the New York Film Festival as the Centerpiece on October 8, 2016. It also screened at the AFI Fest on November 16, 2016. The film was scheduled for a limited release on December 25, 2016, but was pushed back to December 28.\n\nThe film entered wide release in the United States on January 20, 2017, grossing $1,385,336 in its first weekend, ranking 17th overall. It went on to gross a total of $5,664,764.\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 89% based on 209 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"20th Century Women\" offers Annette Bening a too-rare opportunity to shine in a leading role — and marks another assured step forward for writer-director Mike Mills.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 83 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n\nOwen Gleiberman of \"Variety\" gave the film a positive review, writing: \"The best thing about the movie is Bening’s performance as Dorothea Fields, who’s portrayed as a very particular kind of contradictory free spirit. Divorced and proud, with a lot of heart and soul but even more over-sharing flakiness\". David Rooney of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" also gave the film a positive review, writing: \"Mills uses some of the same devices as \"Beginners\" to illuminate his characters' cultural formation, notably historic montages of their birth years or backgrounds prior to coming together. And he also glances ahead to their future lives, after the arc of the movie. But the quilting is more seamless here because the eccentricities are so integral to the writing and performances.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "17312520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17312520", "title": "Architecture of Istanbul", "text": "Architecture of Istanbul\n\nThe Architecture of Istanbul describes a large mixture of structures which reflect the many influences that have made an indelible mark in all districts of the city. The ancient part of the city (the historic peninsula) is still partially surrounded by the Walls of Constantinople, erected in 5th century by the Emperor Theodosius II to protect the city from invasion. The architecture inside the city proper contains buildings, statues, and functional constructions which came from Byzantine, Genoese, Ottoman, and modern Turkish sources. The city has many architecturally significant entities. Throughout its long history, Istanbul has acquired a reputation for being a cultural and ethnic melting pot. As a result, there are many historical mosques, churches, synagogues, palaces, castles and towers to visit in the city.\n\nOne of the oldest monuments still surviving from antiquity is the Serpentine Column, a monument built originally to honor Apollo for the victory over the Persians at Plataea in 479 BC. The column was moved by Constantine the Great when Constantinople became the new capital, and has stood at the Hippodrome ever since. A member of the Polish Embassy visiting in 1700 damaged the top of it severely, breaking off the serpent heads. Today the heads are preserved at the Archaeological Museum in Istanbul.\n\nThe most important monuments of Roman architecture in the city include the Column of Constantine (), which was erected in 330 by Constantine the Great for marking the declaration of the new capital city of the Roman Empire and contained several fragments of the True Cross and other artifacts belonging to Jesus Christ and Virgin Mary, the \"Mazulkemer Aqueduct\", the Valens Aqueduct, the Column of the Goths at the Seraglio Point, the Milion which served for calculating the distances between Constantinople and other cities of the Roman Empire, and the Hippodrome of Constantinople which was built following the model of the Circus Maximus in Rome.\n\nConstruction of the Walls of Constantinople began under Constantine the Great, who enlarged the previously existing walls of Byzantium in order to defend the new Roman capital city which quickly grew following its proclamation as Nova Roma. A new set of walls was built further west during the reign of Theodosius II, and rebuilt after an earthquake in 447 in their current shape. The \"sea walls\" in the Seraglio Point area, which have continuously existed since Lygos and Byzantium, are the oldest part of the city walls; while the \"triple land walls\" of Theodosius II at the western end of the city are the strongest parts. The northwestern section of the land walls was built in 627, during the reign of Heraclius, in order to accommodate the suburb of Blachernae, and added to by later emperors. The city walls had 55 gates, the largest of which was the Porta Aurea (Golden Gate), the ceremonial entrance gate used by the Emperors, at the southwestern end of the triple land walls, close to the Sea of Marmara. Unlike the city walls which were built of brick and limestone, the Porta Aurea was built of large clean-cut white marble blocks in order to distinguish it from the rest, and a quadriga with elephant statues stood on its top. The doors of the Porta Aurea were made of gold, hence the name, which means \"Golden Gate\" in Latin. In 1458 the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II built the Yedikule (\"Seven Towers\") Castle to defend the Porta Aurea, which was incorporated into this castle and still stands as a part of the pentagon-shaped layout of the castle walls. The Column of Marcian () erected by Marcianus (reigned 450–457) dates from the same period as the triple land walls of Theodosius II.\n\nThe most extant Byzantine structure which has survived from the reign of Heraclius (610–641) is the Prison of Anemas, incorporated into the city walls, at Blachernae. It is a huge castle-like structure with several towers and a network of underground Byzantine prisons.\n\nThe early Byzantine architecture followed the classical Roman model of domes and arches, but further improved these architectural concepts, as evidenced with the Hagia Sophia which was designed by Isidorus and Anthemius as the third church to rise on this location, between 532 and 537, following the Nika riots (532) during which the second church was destroyed (the first church, known as the \"Megala Ekklessia\" (\"Great Church\") was inaugurated by Constantius II in 360; the second church was inaugurated by Theodosius II in 405, while the third and current one was inaugurated by Justinian in 537). The Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus (little Hagia Sophia), which was the first church built by Justinian in Constantinople and edificed between 527 and 536, had earlier signaled such an improvement in the design of domed buildings, which require complex solutions for carrying the structure. The present-day Hagia Irene (which was originally built by Constantine in the 4th century, but was later enlarged by Justinian in the 6th century) and the Basilica Cistern are also from this period.\n\nMost Byzantine churches that were built or enlarged by Justinian in the 6th century were originally built in the 4th century at the time of Constantine. The oldest surviving Byzantine church in Istanbul with its original form is the Stoudios (İmrahor) Monastery, which was built in 462. The monastery is also known as \"St. John Stoudios\" because it was dedicated to St. John the Baptist. The roof of the building doesn't exist today, but its surrounding walls as well as its splendid floor decorations are still intact. Many important decisions regarding Christianity were made inside this building, including the heated debates on the identity of Virgin Mary (whether or not she was \"Theotokos\" (\"Mother of God\") and whether it was right to condemn Nestorius who opposed this definition) as well as the debates and clashes on Iconoclasm.\n\nFollowing the decision by Theodora, wife of Theophilus, to restore the icons in 843, many churches and other prominent Byzantine buildings in the city were adorned with new icons, but some, like Hagia Irene, still bear the signs of the iconoclastic period. The Boukoleon Palace largely dates from the reign of Theophilus.\n\nThe Palace of the Porphyrogenitus (), which is the only surviving part of the Blachernae Palace, dates from the period of the Fourth Crusade. In these years, on the northern side of the Golden Horn, the Dominican priests of the Catholic Church built the Church of Saint Paul in 1233.\n\nThe most important churches which were built after the Byzantines took Constantinople back in 1261 include the Chora Church and the Pammakaristos Church. The final structure of the Chora Church that exists reflects the five additions that were finished during the tenure of the last \"ktetor\", Theodore Metochites, from 1316 to 1321. In the year 1511 the church was officially converted into a mosque, and named Kariye Camii. In 1945, the mosque was converted into a museum, and has been named Kariye Muzesi to this day. After many centuries, only the church, the southern chapel, and another building to the north remain.\n\nThe Pammakaristos Church was constructed in the early part of the 12th century for Michael VII Ducas and his wife Mary (sister of Alexius II Comnenus). It was the largest church in the city at that time that served a monastery for women. Before the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople, the sarcophagii of Alexius I Comnenus and his daughter Anna rested within the chapel inside the monastery. In 1453, the nuns were removed, but the church was allowed to remain untouched, except for a giant cross which existed on the dome. The cross was removed by Sultan Suleiman in 1547 after numerous complaints. In 1586, Sultan Murad III converted it into a mosque, naming it the Fethiye Camii.\n\nAlso in this period, the Genoese Podestà of Galata, Montano de Marinis, built the \"Palazzo del Comune\" (1314), a copy of the San Giorgio Palace in Genoa, which still stands in ruins on the back streets of \"Bankalar Caddesi\" in Galata, together with its adjacent buildings and numerous Genoese houses from the early 14th century.\n\nAncient Athenian general Alcibiades, after the naval victory at Cyzicus, possibly built a custom station for ships coming from Black Sea on a small rock in front of Chrysopolis (today's üsküdar). In 1110 Byzantine Emperor Alexius Comnenus built on this site a wooden tower protected by a stone wall. The structure, known as Leander's Tower after the legend of Hero and Leander (which took place in the Dardanelles), was rebuilt and restored several times by the Ottoman Turks, until in 1763 it was erected using stone. The most recent restoration took place in 1998. Steel supports were added around the ancient tower as a precaution after the 1999 İzmit earthquake.\n\nThe Genoese also built the Galata Tower, which they named as \"Christea Turris\" (Tower of Christ), at the highest point of the citadel of Galata, in 1348.\n\nThe Ottoman Turks built the Anadoluhisarı on the Asian side of the Bosphorus in 1394, and the Rumelihisarı at the opposite (European) shore, in 1452, a year before the conquest of Constantinople. The main purpose of these castles, armed with the long range \"Balyemez\" (\"Faule Metze\") cannons, was to block the sea traffic of the Bosphorus and prevent the support ships from the Genoese colonies on the Black Sea ports, such as Caffa, Sinop, and Amasra, from reaching Constantinople and helping the Byzantines during the Turkish siege of the city.\n\nFollowing the Ottoman conquest of the city, Sultan Mehmed II initiated a wide scale reconstruction plan, which included the construction of grand buildings such as the Eyüp Sultan Mosque, Fatih Mosque, Topkapı Palace, The Grand Bazaar and the Yedikule (Seven Towers) Castle which guarded the main entrance gate of the city, the Porta Aurea (Golden Gate). In the centuries following Mehmed II, many new important buildings, such as the Süleymaniye Mosque, Sultanahmet Mosque, Yeni Mosque and numerous others were constructed.\nTraditionally, Ottoman buildings were built of ornate wood. Only \"state buildings\" such as palaces and mosques were built of stone. Starting from the 18th and 19th centuries, wood was gradually replaced with stone as the primary building material, while traditional Ottoman architectural styles were gradually replaced with European styles, such as the Baroque style interiors of the Aynalıkavak Palace (1677–1679) and Nuruosmaniye Mosque (1748–1755, the first Baroque style mosque in the city, also famous for its Baroque fountain), and the 18th century Baroque additions to the Harem section of Topkapı Palace. Following the Tanzimat reforms which effectively started Turkey's Europeanization process in 1839, new palaces and mosques were built in Neoclassical, Baroque and Rococo styles, or a mixture of all three, such as the Dolmabahçe Palace, Beylerbeyi Palace and Ortaköy (Mecidiye) Mosque designed and constructed by the Balyan family members:\n. Even Neo-Gothic mosques were built, such as the Pertevniyal Valide Sultan Mosque and Yıldız Hamidiye Mosque. Large state buildings like schools or military barracks were also built in various European styles.\n\nStarting from the early 19th century, the areas around İstiklal Avenue were filled with grandiose embassy buildings belonging to prominent European states, and rows of European (mostly Neoclassical and later Art Nouveau) style buildings started to appear on both flanks of the avenue. Istanbul especially became a major center of the Art Nouveau movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with famous architects of this style like Raimondo D'Aronco building many palaces and mansions in the city proper and on the Princes' Islands. His most important works in the city include several buildings of the Yıldız Palace complex, and the \"Botter House\" on İstiklal Avenue. The famous \"Camondo Stairs\" on Bankalar Caddesi (Banks Street) in Karaköy (Galata) is also a beautiful example of Art Nouveau architecture. Other important examples are the \"Hıdiv Kasrı\" (Khedive Palace) on the Asian side of the Bosphorus, \"Flora Han\" in Sirkeci, and \"Frej Apartmanı\" in the Şişhane quarter of Beyoğlu.\n\nThus, by the mid-19th century, the southern part of the Golden Horn (the historic peninsula of Constantinople) had a traditionally Ottoman Turkish appearance and population, while the northern part of the Golden Horn became more and more Europeanized both in terms of architecture and in terms of demographics. The Galata Bridge had become a connection between the oriental and occidental (southern and northern) parts of the European side of Istanbul.\n\nThe Bosphorus was regarded as a summer resort during the Ottoman period and the traditional wooden houses and mansions, called \"yalı\", were the choice of the wealthy Ottoman elite. Most of the development happened during the Tulip Period, a period which is best represented by the Sadullah Paşa Yalısı built in 1783. The oldest surviving yalı is the Amcazade Köprülü Hüseyin Pasha yalı located in Kandilli on the Asiatic shores of the Bosphorus and dates from 1699. The wooden seaside chalet mansions retained their basic architectural principles until the middle of the 19th century, when they were gradually replaced by less flammable brick houses especially during the First Constitutional Period. The development of yalıs lasted until the First World War.\n\n"}

The society was originally the idea of the lawyer Bellenden Ker and was founded at a meeting in the house of the famous painter Charles Eastlake, attended by Eastlake, Ker, Giovanni Aubrey Bezzi, and Edmund Oldfield. The society's purpose was to promote knowledge of the art works of the old Italian, Flemish, and other European masters. Much of the work of the society consisted of publishing chromolithographs of Italian art works, especially fresco paintings, of earlier centuries and raising public awareness for the preservation of these works. One of the people most responsible for furthering the goals of the society was Henry Layard, who joined in 1852. Some of the other important early members were John Ruskin, Charles Thomas Newton, and Henry Liddell. Members of the Society's Council in 1877 included Frederick William Burton, Lord Elcho (Francis Charteris), Edward Poynter, George Edmund Street, Philip Charles Hardwick, George Richmond, and the architect John Norton. The society was discontinued in 1897.\n\nThe Arundel Club was a society founded in London in 1904 for the purpose of continuing more effectively the work of the Arundel Society, which had encouraged the study of art by reproducing the best works of the old masters. The Arundel Club went further by copying and publishing important works in private collections previously inaccessible.\n\n"}
{"id": "39090951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39090951", "title": "Belle (2013 film)", "text": "Belle (2013 film)\n\nBelle is a 2013 British period drama film directed by Amma Asante, written by Misan Sagay and produced by Damian Jones. It stars Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Tom Wilkinson, Miranda Richardson, Penelope Wilton, Sam Reid, Matthew Goode, Emily Watson, Sarah Gadon, Tom Felton and James Norton.\n\nThe film is inspired by the 1779 painting of Dido Elizabeth Belle beside her cousin Lady Elizabeth Murray, at Kenwood House, which was commissioned by their great-uncle, William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield, then Lord Chief Justice of England. Very little is known about the life of Dido Belle, who was born in the West Indies and was the illegitimate mixed-race daughter of Mansfield's nephew. She is found living in poverty by her father and entrusted to the care of Mansfield and his wife. The fictional film centres on Dido's relationship with an aspiring lawyer; it is set at a time of legal significance, as a court case is heard on what became known as the \"Zong\" massacre, when slaves were thrown overboard from a slave ship and the owner filed with his insurance company for the losses. Lord Mansfield rules on this case in England's Court of King's Bench in 1786, in a decision seen to contribute to the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act of 1807.\n\nDido Elizabeth Belle Lindsay was born in 1761, the natural daughter of Maria Belle, an enslaved African woman in the West Indies, and Captain Sir John Lindsay, a British Royal Navy officer. After Dido's mother's death in 1765, Captain Lindsay takes her from the West Indies slums and entrusts her to his uncle William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield, the Lord Chief Justice, and his wife Elizabeth, who live at Kenwood House, an estate in Hampstead outside London. Lord and Lady Mansfield raise Dido as a free gentlewoman, along with their niece Lady Elizabeth Murray, who came to live with them after her mother died and her father remarried. When the two cousins reach adulthood, the Mansfields commission an oil portrait of their two great-nieces, but Dido is unhappy about sitting for it as she is worried that it will portray her as a subordinate, similar to other portraits she has seen depicting aristocrats with black servants. Dido's father dies and leaves her the generous sum of £2,000 a year, enough to make her an heiress. Lady Elizabeth, by contrast, will have no income from her father, whose son from his new wife has been named his sole heir. Arrangements are made for Elizabeth to have her coming-out to society, but Lord and Lady Mansfield believe no gentleman will agree to marry Dido because of her mixed-race status, so while she will travel to London with her cousin, she will not be \"out\" to society.\n\nLord Mansfield agrees to take a vicar's son, John Davinier, into an apprenticeship for law. In 1783, Mansfield hears the case of \"Gregson v. Gilbert\", regarding the payment of an insurance claim, for slaves killed when thrown overboard by the captain of a slave-ship — an event now known as the \"Zong\" massacre. Dido helps her uncle with his correspondence and after John tells her about the \"Zong\" case, she begins sneaking correspondence to him which he believes will advance the cause of the abolitionists. Lord Mansfield and John have a disagreement on the main issue of the case. John is told not to see Dido again, and his apprenticeship is at an end. Dido’s aunts, Lady Mansfield and Lady Mary Murray, Lord Mansfield's sister, seek to steer Dido into an engagement with Oliver Ashford, son of a scheming grand dame and younger brother to the bigoted James Ashford. At first James is interested in Elizabeth but stops courting her once he discovers she will have no inheritance. Oliver, who is without fortune, proposes to Dido and she accepts, although she continues to see John. James takes Dido aside, tells her she will disgrace his family's name, then insults and manhandles her. Dido later tells Elizabeth of his true character and says she will give part of her inheritance to her for a dowry so she can find a different match. Lord Mansfield finds out about Dido's visits to John and confronts both of them. During the confrontation, John professes his love for Dido. Sometime later, Dido meets with Oliver and breaks off their engagement.\n\nDido is relieved when the painting is unveiled, showing her as Elizabeth's equal. She tells Lord Mansfield that the portrait commission proves that he can defy convention. Dido sneaks into the balcony of the Inn of Court, so that she can hear Lord Mansfield narrowly rule that the Gregson slave-trading syndicate, based in Liverpool, is not due insurance payments for the slaves the crew threw overboard during the voyage. The ship's officers claimed they ordered this action because they were out of potable water. Lord Mansfield discovers, however, that the \"Zong\" passed by many ports without stopping for more water, before killing the slaves. It appeared to Lord Mansfield that the slaves' quarters were over-crowded, making them sick and not likely to fetch a high price at auction, so the officers decided they would be worth more in insurance payments after their loss. Lord Mansfield sees John and Dido outside the Court after his ruling and says that Dido can only marry a gentleman. Therefore, he agrees to resume John's apprenticeship in law, so that he can become a lawyer. Dido and John share a kiss, both in full acknowledgement of their romantic feelings.\n\nOn-screen text informs the viewer that Dido and John married and had two sons (they actually had three), that Elizabeth also married and had children, and that the painting hung at Kenwood House until 1922, when it was moved to Scone Palace in Scotland, the birthplace of Lord Mansfield.\n\n\nThe 1779 painting, once thought to be by Johann Zoffany, is now attributed to David Martin. The painting hung in Kenwood House until 1922 and now hangs at Scone Palace in Perthshire, Scotland. It was one of the first European portraits to portray a black subject on an equal eye-line with a white aristocrat, though distinctions are implied by the poses, as Elizabeth's \"formality and bookishness are contrasted with the wild and exotically turbanned 'natural' figure of Belle.\"\n\nThe painting is replicated in the film with the faces of the actresses portraying the characters replacing those in the original. Dido's finger-to-cheek gesture is absent in the fictionalised version, as is her feathered turban. The original picture is shown on screen at the end of the film.\n\nFilming began on 24 September 2012. The film was shot on location in the Isle of Man, Oxford and London. It is the first major British motion picture to be shot in true-4K, using Sony’s F65 CineAlta digital production camera. The film was produced by DJ Films, Isle of Man Film, and Pinewood Pictures with support from the BFI.\n\nProduction designer Simon Bowles created the 18th-century Bristol Docks on the Isle of Man and created Kenwood House, based on a number of stately homes in the London area.\n\nOriginal music for the film was composed by Rachel Portman.\n\nThe film is a work of historical fiction, inspired by a painting and the evidence that Dido was brought up at Kenwood House. The relative lack of details about Dido Elizabeth Belle allowed screenwriter Misan Sagay considerable artistic licence in framing the young woman's story, within the broader historical context of the slave economy and the abolition movement.\n\nThe only other direct historical reference made about Belle, other than the painting and Thomas Hutchinson's personal diary, appear in \"Elements of Moral Science\", a 1790 work by the Scottish professor of moral philosophy James Beattie, who met Belle and in the book states she recited poetry with \"a degree of elegance\" equal to any English child of her age, arguing against the then prevailing theory that \"negroes are naturally and utterly incapable of distinct articulation\".\n\nWilliam Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield, who was Lord Chief Justice of England from 1756 to 1788, presided over two important cases, \"Somerset v Stewart\" in 1772 and the \"Zong\" insurance claims case in 1783, which helped lay the groundwork for Britain's Slave Trade Act 1807. As in the film, he was the great-uncle of Dido Elizabeth Belle and Lady Elizabeth Murray.\n\nAt the suggestion of the producers, HarperCollins published a companion book \"Belle - The Slave Daughter and the Lord Chief Justice\" by biographer Paula Byrne recounting the lives of the film's principal characters.\n\nSagay chose to set the major events; Belle's and Elizabeth's love affairs and the Zong case, in the same year the painting was made - when Belle was about 18. In reality, Belle married at 32, long after Lady Elizabeth was married and no longer in touch with Belle. \n\nJohn Davinier was in real life a French manservant at Kenwood, not an English apprentice lawyer. \n\nJames Walvin OBE, professor emeritus of the University of York, said of \"Belle\": \"Much of the historical evidence is there – though festooned in the film with imaginary relishes and fictional tricks. Partly accurate, the whole thing reminded me of the classic Morecambe and Wise sketch with Andre Previn (Eric bashing away on the piano): all the right notes – but not necessarily in the right order.\" Reviewing the film for \"History Extra\", the official website of \"BBC History Magazine\", Walvin noted that while the second half of the film centres on Dido Elizabeth Belle's involvement in the \"Zong\" case, in reality she was \"nowhere to be found in the \"Zong\" affair\". In the film \"Tom Wilkinson’s Mansfield finds his cold legal commercial heart softened, and edged towards abolition by the eyelash-fluttering efforts of his stunning great niece\" and his \"adjudication becomes, not a point of law, but the first bold assertion towards the end of slavery\". Walvin points out that \"he merely stated that there should be another hearing of the \"Zong\" case – this time with evidence not known at the earlier hearing\". Walvin awarded the film one star for enjoyment and two for historical accuracy.\n\nSome press coverage ahead of filming, cited Amma Asante as the sole writer of \"Belle\", as well as director. Press releases that followed Fox Searchlight's acquisition of the film, gave the final credit determined by the Writers Guild of America, West as \"Written by Misan Sagay\".\nBaz Bamigboye of \"The Daily Mail\" wrote that cast members Tom Wilkinson and Penelope Wilton had expressed \"incredulity\" at the accreditation decision, because Wilkinson and Wilton had \"only seen and worked from a script written by Amma\", whose writing and direction of her debut film won her the Carl Foreman award at the BAFTAs in 2005. The article reported that Asante had been hired to re-draft an original screenplay written by Misan Sagay, after Sagay left the project due to serious ill-health. The subsequent arbitration process undertaken by the Writers Guild of America, determined that Sagay provided the bulk of content used in the script, so Sagay was awarded sole writing credit. Producer Damian Jones confirmed, \"There was a WGA arbitration. The WGA made its decision on writing credits. And the production respects and abides by their decision.\" Asante appealed but lost.\n\nIn July 2013, it was announced that Fox Searchlight Pictures had acquired distribution rights for the film in the UK and USA. \"Belle\" premiered at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival on 8 September 2013. The film was released on 2 May 2014 in the United States, 9 May in Canada and 13 June 2014 in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe film received positive reviews from critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a \"Certified Fresh\" score of 83% based on reviews from 127 critics, with an average rating of 7/10. The site's consensus states, \"It boasts all the surface beauty that fans of period pictures have come to expect, but \"Belle\" also benefits from its stirring performances and subtle social consciousness.\" Critic Mark Kermode named it his fourth-favourite film of 2014.\n\n\n"}

The first folio collection, issued in 1616, treated stage plays as serious works of literature instead of popular ephemera—at the time, a controversial position. The 1616 folio stood as a precedent for other play collections that followed—most notably the First Folio of Shakespeare's plays in 1623, but also the first Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1647, and other collections that were important in preserving the dramatic literature of the age for subsequent generations.\n\nThe first Jonson folio of 1616, printed and published by William Stansby and sold through bookseller Richard Meighen, contained nine plays, all previously published, plus two works of non-dramatic poetry, thirteen masques, and six \"entertainments.\"\n\n\nThe first five of the masques, from \"Blackness\" through \"Queens\", had been printed previously, as had three of the entertainments, the \"Panegyre\", and the \"Epigrams\".\n\nIn 1631 Jonson planned a second volume to be added to the 1616 folio, a collection of later-written works to be published by Robert Allot. Jonson, however, became dissatisfied with the quality of the printing (by John Beale), and cancelled the project. Three plays were set into type for the projected collection, and printings of those typecasts were circulated—though whether they were sold commercially or distributed privately by Jonson is unclear. The three plays are:\n\nAllot died in 1635; in the 1637–39 period, the rights to Jonson's works were involved in a complex legal dispute between Philip Chetwinde, the second husband of Allot's widow, and stationers Andrew Crooke and John Legatt, who believed they owned the rights to the works.\n\nTwo folio collections of Jonsonian works were issued in 1640-41. The first, printed by Richard Bishop for Andrew Crooke, was a 1640 reprint of the 1616 folio with corrections and emendations; it has sometimes been termed \"the second edition of the first folio.\" The second volume was edited by Jonson's literary executor Sir Kenelm Digby, and published by Richard Meighen, in co-operation with Chetwinde. That volume contained later works, most of them unpublished or uncollected previously—six plays (including the three printed in 1631), two of them incomplete, and fifteen masques, plus miscellaneous pieces. In the Digby/Meighen volume—identified on its title page as \"the Second Volume\" of Jonson's works—the varying dates (1631, 1640, 1641) in some of the texts, and what editor William Savage Johnson once called \"irregularity in contents and arrangement in different copies,\" have caused significant confusion.\n\n\nThe 1692 single-volume third folio was printed by Thomas Hodgkin and published by a syndicate of booksellers—the title page lists H. Herringman, E. Brewster, T. Bassett, R. Chiswell, M. Wotton, and G. Converse. The third folio added two works to the previous total: the play \"The New Inn,\" and \"Leges Convivales\".\n\nTwo other works by Jonson were left out of the 17th-century folios but added to later editions: the plays \"The Case is Altered\" and \"Eastward Ho\" (the latter written with Marston and George Chapman).\n\n\n"}

She met William here in 1781, during his brief visit to the area, while he was recovering from an emotional upset following the failure of an earlier relationship. Their courtship was brief. According to early biographers of Blake, Catherine immediately recognised him as her future husband and when she sympathised with him over his earlier emotional troubles he replied \"do you pity me? Then I love you.\" \nBlake married Catherine – who was five years his junior – on 18 August 1782 in St. Mary's Church, Battersea. Illiterate, Catherine signed her wedding contract with an 'X'. They remained together until his death in 1827. Blake taught her to read and write, and also to use his printing-press.\n\nThe couple did not have children, and it has been suggested that Blake wanted to bring a concubine into the relationship to act as a surrogate mother, which was consistent with the theories of Swedenborgianism by which Blake was influenced. Blake's earliest biographer Alexander Gilchrist does not mention this, but speaks of unspecified troubles in the early years of the relationship. However, Algernon Charles Swinburne later explicitly asserted that this was the case, but that Blake dropped the idea when he saw that it upset Catherine. No documentary evidence survives supporting this notion, but Blake is known to have stated that he \"learned from the Bible that wives should be held in common.\"\n\nWriters who knew the couple in their later years describe a very happy relationship. In 1802, William Hayley wrote that William \"and his excellent wife (a true helpmate!) pass the plates thro' a rolling press in their own cottage together\". On his deathbed, Blake drew a picture of Catherine as his last work, stating \"you have ever been an angel to me\".\n\nAfter her husband's death Catherine was taken in by Blake's admirer Frederick Tatham, for whom she nominally worked as a housekeeper. At this period she continued to sell Blake's works. When she died four years later Tatham claimed that she had bequeathed all Blake's works to him. When he later converted to Irvingite beliefs, he destroyed a number of them, asserting that they were inspired by the devil.\n\nThroughout her husband's uneven career, Catherine not only took an active role in the production of William's engravings and illuminated books; she also ran the household finances and offered strong practical support. William's friend J. T. Smith said that Blake \"allowed her, to the last moment of his practice, to take off his proof impressions and print his works, which she did most carefully.\" Catherine's role in colouring at least some of William's illuminated books has been wide, although her hand is usually attributed to some of the more clumsily rendered passages. Her work as a printer is held in higher regard.\n\nIt has often been suggested that the figure of Enitharmon in Blake's mythology is partly inspired by Catherine. Enitharmon is the wife of the \"eternal prophet\" Los in Blake's writings. Catherine is explicitly identified as the poet's \"shadow of delight\" in the second part of Blake's \"Milton a Poem\".\n\nCatherine appears as a model wife in William Hayley's writings on ideal marriages. In more recent literature, she is the central character in Janet Adele Warner's novel \"Other Sorrows, Other Joys: The Marriage of Catherine Sophia Boucher and William Blake\" (2001) and also features in Tracy Chevalier's novel \"Burning Bright\" (2007). She is an amateur detective in short stories by Keith Heller.\n\nJack Shepherd's stage play \"In Lambeth\" dramatised a visit by Thomas Paine to the Lambeth home of William and Catherine Blake in 1789. It was first performed at the East Dulwich Tavern in July 1989. The play was later adapted for television in the BBC Two \"Encounters\" series (which featured similar fictionalised meetings between historical figures) and was first broadcast on 4 July 1993. It was directed by Sebastian Graham-Jones, and featured Mark Rylance as William, Bob Peck as Paine and Lesley Clare O'Neill as Catherine.\n\n"}

Chromaticity consists of two independent parameters, often specified as hue (h) and colorfulness (s), where the latter is alternatively called saturation, chroma, intensity, or excitation purity. This number of parameters follows from trichromacy of vision of most humans, which is assumed by most models in color science.\n\nIn color science, the white point of an illuminant or of a display is a neutral reference characterized by a chromaticity; all other chromaticities may be defined in relation to this reference using polar coordinates. The \"hue\" is the angular component, and the \"purity\" is the radial component, normalized by the maximum radius for that hue.\n\nPurity is roughly equivalent to the term \"saturation\" in the HSV color model. The property \"hue\" is as used in general color theory and in specific color models such as HSV and HSL color spaces, though it is more perceptually uniform in color models such as Munsell, CIELAB or CIECAM02.\n\nSome color spaces separate the three dimensions of color into one luminance dimension and a pair of chromaticity dimensions. For example, the white point of an sRGB display is an ,  chromaticity of (0.3127, 0.3290), where and coordinates are used in the xyY space.\n\nThese pairs determine a chromaticity as affine coordinates on a triangle in a 2D-space, which contains all possible chromaticities. These and are used because of simplicity of expression in CIE 1931 (see below) and have no inherent advantage. Other coordinate systems on the same X-Y-Z triangle, or other color triangles, can be used.\n\nOn the other hand, some color spaces such as RGB and XYZ do not separate out chromaticity, but chromaticity is defined by a mapping that normalizes out intensity, and its coordinates, such as and or and , can be calculated through the division operation, such as  , and so on.\n\nThe xyY space is a cross between the CIE XYZ and its normalized chromaticity coordinates xyz, such that the luminance Y is preserved and augmented with just the required two chromaticity dimensions.\n\n"}

The story of the trailer follows a family who is attacked by a horde of zombies in a hotel. The trailer ends with the infected daughter, who has turned into a zombie, being thrown to her death from a hotel window. The trailer was produced by Glasgow-based Axis Animation, with music created by Giles Lamb.\n\nThe trailer was designed to be emotional, allowing players to care for the characters and to be distinct from trailers for the game's competitors. The trailer does not show any actual gameplay, instead telling a short story about the game's world and the background behind its events. The development team also had the goal to show the inevitability and the helplessness of a family in a zombie outbreak. Upon its release on February 16, 2011, the trailer sparked public interest, and the community reaction led Techland to adjust the content of the actual game. It was met with a mixed reception from critics. Praise was directed at the trailer's new ideas, story, immersion and tone, however, it received criticism for lacking gameplay information and its depiction of a dead child. The trailer received multiple awards upon release.\n\nThe story is presented in reverse chronological order and in slow motion. The trailer follows a family, consisting of a father, a mother and a daughter, visiting Banoi, an island paradise. After they have settled in a hotel, an unexpected zombie outbreak occurs. The daughter is running away from the horde of zombies in the hotel's corridor and dashing towards her room, where her father and mother are staying, when she is caught. A zombie bites the daughter's legs, causing her to become infected with the zombie virus.\n\nThe father opens the door and picks up a fire axe to fight against zombies. He rescues his daughter and brings her inside the hotel room. After placing the injured daughter on a bed, the couple begin fighting the zombies who are breaking into the room. The zombies overwhelm them, and the daughter turns into a zombie and attacks her father, biting him on the neck. To defend himself, the father struggles, trying to push her off, until he throws her out of the window, breaking the glass. The daughter dies on impact with the ground. While the father is struggling, the mother is attacked and eaten by several zombies. The corpses of the couple can be seen in a hotel room in the beginning of the game.\n\n\"Dead Island\", originally announced in 2007 by Techland, is an action role-playing survival horror video game. Set in a zombie-infested tropical island called Banoi, the game focuses heavily on melee combat. According to Techland, it was a game about killing zombies, not a game focused on delivering an emotional experience. Until 2011, Techland declined to give new information regarding the game as requested by the game's publisher, Deep Silver. With the lack of new information surrounding the game, many critics believed that the game had been quietly cancelled. The game was released on February 16, 2011, approximately four years after the game's initial announcement.\n\nThe trailer was produced and made by the Glasgow-based Axis Animation, which had previously created trailers for \"Killzone 2\" and \"Mass Effect 2\". According to Stuart Aitken, Axis's Managing Director and Technical Director and the director of the trailer, Deep Silver gave the team a lot of creative freedom and flexibility in creating the trailer, allowing them to create their own characters instead of using the in-game protagonists. Deep Silver had given them a script and general ideas for them to follow, and the team expanded upon it. In order to make the trailer feel non-linear and focused, the team decided to narrow down the trailer's location to only a single hotel room. Deep Silver wanted the trailer to have some exterior environment. As a result, the team added a segment which has the daughter falling from the hotel window; in the process, audiences glimpse the island setting.\n\nThe team hoped that despite the short duration of the trailer, audiences would understand the story and be connected with its characters. They decided that it would be easy for players to identify with a family and that a story involving parents and children could convey the message quickly. They intended to use the trailer to depict the background information of the game, presenting information regarding the \"discovery\" of the outbreak, its inevitability, and the helplessness of the family. The team had an internal debate on whether the trailer should show guns, ultimately deciding that doing so would distract from the primary goal of the story. The story originally had the mother turn into a zombie, but the team changed it to the daughter, as they considered her more vulnerable when facing a large group of zombies. The team was worried that the action and violence featured would seem excessive, and they decided to alleviate the problem by introducing non-chronological storytelling. Deep Silver also proposed to mitigate the violence by having the trailer presented in slow motion, as they believed that it could make the action feel \"balletic\" instead of purely violent.\n\nThe trailer is made up of computer imagery, and it does not show any actual gameplay footage of \"Dead Island\". The team hoped to use the trailer as a piece of \"artwork\", stating influence from the \"Carousel\" trailer from Philips. The trailer was also designed to showcase \"great zombie moments\" in an effort to attract the genre's supporters. The actual game development team used the trailer to build up the mood and atmosphere for the game, and they designed quests which required players to help people who had lost their families. They hoped that the mood would make players feel that they were the only hope existing on the island.\n\nThe trailer's music was composed by Giles Lamb, who worked for a soundtrack development company called Savalas. The music was designed to be \"somber\", \"melancholy\", and \"elegant\", in contrast with the gore presented in the trailer. The music was designed to be tense when the trailer is depicting violent action, and beautiful during peaceful moments. The team hoped that the music would create a \"juxtaposition between beauty and horror\".\n\nPopular reaction to the trailer led Techland to slightly adjust the game's tone, gameplay, and story, as well as the game's promotion strategy.\n\nA week after the release of the trailer, more than one million people had viewed it through YouTube, exceeding Deep Silver's expectation of only 100,000 views. \"Dead Island\" also became one of the most searched items on Google, YouTube, and Twitter for several days. Axis was pleasantly surprised at the trailer's popularity. Following the trailer's release, \"Dead Island\" became a widely anticipated game.\n\nMany critics praised the trailer's use of reverse storytelling. Keith Stuart from \"The Guardian\" compared it favorably to Coldplay's \"The Scientist\", saying that it successfully delivered an affecting and emotive experience. Mike Fahey from \"Kotaku\" called the trailer's use of the dead girl \"heartbreaking\" and thought that it would be amazing if Techland was able to incorporate these emotional elements into the actual game. Its graphics and pacing also received commendation. The trailer's story was praised for presenting an unconventional take on a zombie apocalypse. Jason Schreier from \"Wired\" said that the trailer had successfully made a saturated genre feel fresh again.\n\nThe trailer generated controversy around the depiction of the daughter's death. Fahey said that such elements are something video games usually \"shy away from\", yet it is presented as a main focus in the trailer. Ben Parfitt from \"Market for Home Computing and Video Games\" found it offensive and thought that the team had stepped across the mark. Defending the trailer, Axis said that their depiction fit the overarching narrative. Robert Rath from \"The Escapist\" also liked the segment, calling it \"deliberate and necessary\", and thought that the overall effect would have been significantly hampered if had been removed from the trailer.\n\nThe lack of gameplay information was also criticized. Laura Parker found the trailer disconnected from the actual game, with the trailer being misleading by not showing any in-game information, and with the game failing to deliver the same emotional effect as the trailer. Daemon Hatfield from IGN similarly thought that the trailer was not useful in assessing the game's quality and expressed concerns that the game would not be as entertaining and interesting as the trailer. Upon release, many reviewers thought that the trailer had set expectation too high for the actual game, and that the game ended up not meeting expectations.\n\nThe trailer was given a gold award at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. It was named by gaming journalists as one of the best video game trailers ever made.\n\nA live-action remake and a recut version of the trailer which shows the story in a chronological order were released by fans. The announcement trailer also boosted the popularity of Techland and Deep Silver. The announcement trailer for \"\", released in 2012, featured a similar, depressing tone. A trailer for \"Goat Simulator\" in 2014 also mimicked the format of the \"Dead Island\" announcement trailer. A movie tie-in based on the trailer was once proposed by Lionsgate, though the project was ultimately cancelled. Deep Silver released a musical tribute to the trailer, coinciding with the launch of \"\" in May 2016.\n\n"}

The style developed under the patronage of Deccan sultanates—( namely, Bijapur, Golkonda, Ahmadnagar, Bidar, and Berar ) and lasted until the extinct of the Qutb Shahi dynasty in 1687 AD.\n\nWhile Mughal painting was developing under Akbar, in the second half of the 16th century, the art form was evolving independently in the Deccan sultanates. The miniature painting style, which flourished initially in the Bahmani court of Bahmani Sultanate and later in the courts of Ahmadnagar, Bijapur, Bidar Berrar and Golkonda is popularly known as the Deccan school of Painting. One of the earliest surviving paintings are found as the illustrations of a manuscript \"Tarif-i-Hussain Shahi\" (1565 AD), which is now in Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal, Pune.

{"id": "26744173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26744173", "title": "Dialogue of Pessimism", "text": "Dialogue of Pessimism\n\nThe Dialogue of Pessimism is an ancient Mesopotamian dialogue between a master and his servant that expresses the futility of human action. It has parallels with biblical wisdom literature.\n\nThe Dialogue is a loosely poetic composition in Akkadian, written soon after 1000 BC in Mesopotamia. It was discovered in five different clay tablet manuscripts written in the cuneiform script. The text is well-preserved, with only 15 of its 86 lines being fragmentary. Two textual versions seem to survive, as a Babylonian tablet is substantially different from Assyrian versions. Its likely Akkadian title was \"arad mitanguranni\", the repeated phrase at the beginning of every stanza.\n\nThe Dialogue of Pessimism takes the form of a dialogue between a master and his slave valet. In each of the first ten stanzas the master proposes a course of action, for which the slave provides good reasons. Each time, however, the master changes his mind and the slave provides equally good reasons for not pursuing that course of action. The courses of action are:\nI. Driving to the palace\n\nII. Dining\n\nIII. Hunting\n\nIV. Marriage (“building a house” in Speiser)\n\nV. Litigation (this is the most fragmentary stanza)\n\nVI. Leading a revolution (“commit a crime” in Speiser)\n\nVII. Sexual intercourse\n\nVIII. Sacrifice\n\nIX. Making investments (“plant crops” in Speiser)\n\nX. Public service\nA sample of the Dialogue is (Master \"Slave\"):\nSlave, listen to me! \"Here I am, master, here I am!\"\nI want to make love to a woman! \"Make love, master, make love!\"\n\"The man who makes love forgets sorrow and fear!\"\nO well, slave, I do not want to make love to a woman.\n\"Do not make love, master, do not make love.\"\n\"Woman is a real pitfall, a hole, a ditch,\"\n\"Woman is a sharp iron dagger that cuts a man’s throat.\"\n(Stanza VII, lines 46–52) \nStanza XI is substantially different:\nSlave, listen to me! \"Here I am, master, here I am!\"\nWhat then is good?\nTo have my neck and yours broken,\nor to be thrown into the river, is that good?\n\"Who is so tall as to ascend to heaven?\"\n\"Who is so broad as to encompass the entire world?\"\nO well, slave! I will kill you and send you first!\n\"Yes, but my master would certainly not survive me for three days.\" \nThe dialogue is limited to two people (unlike, for instance, Plato’s dialogues), as is common in ancient Middle-Eastern wisdom literature. In the scribal tradition of Mesopotamian literature, one learns by verbal instruction and reflective reading, not by debate. It has been suggested that it may have been a dramatic text, performed publicly. Rather than a set of abstract or universal principles to be applied to every situation, the slave employs concrete images and instances.\n\nThe dialogue stands consciously in the continuum of Mesopotamian literature. Line 76 quotes a line at the beginning and the end of the Epic of Gilgamesh. Lines 86–87 quote an ancient Sumerian saying. Lines 62–69 may allude to a part of the Great Hymn to Shamash (lines 118–127).\n\nThe Dialogue falls into the philosophical area of theodicy. Interpretation of the Dialogue is divided. Some see it as a statement of life's absurdity, because there are no definitive right and wrong choices or reasons for action. The final stanza is therefore a logical outcome of this quandary, the choice of non-existence over existential futility. An opposing interpretation takes its cue from the slave's final cheeky retort, seeing the Dialogue as social satire, where the servile yet cheeky slave exposes the vacillation and unproductiveness of his aristocratic master through conflicting and clichéd answers. Religious satire is also present in comments about the behaviour of the gods.\n\nParallels with the second-millennium Mesopotamian text \"Monologue of the Righteous Sufferer\" (also known as \"I will praise the Lord of Wisdom\") and the biblical Book of Ecclesiastes suggest a third interpretation. The universe is indeed enigmatic and human actions seemingly meaningless, yet the gods hold the secrets of the universe (revealed in the slave's comment about heaven and earth in Stanza XI). Rather than suggesting death out of despair, the master wants the slave to enter before him into death so that he can ask the gods. The slave’s final satirical rejoinder parries his master's suggestion. The Dialogue's purpose is partly satirical and partly serious, and its end is to remind readers that the gods control the destinies, which are unknown to us. The wise man, like the slave, reserves judgement and assesses possibilities in the face of life’s ambiguities, albeit while retaining his sense of humour.\n\nThere is a thematic parallel between the Dialogue of Pessimism and the Book of Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament. The affirmations and their negations given by the Dialogue's slave are similar to the list of actions and their opposites given in Ecclesiastes 3:1-9 (\"a time to be born and a time to die...\"). Ecclesiastes, like the Dialogue, has been the subject of pessimistic and optimistic interpretations, and is also amenable to the interpretation that the incomprehensibility of the universe and human life point to our limitations and the transcendent knowledge of God.\n\nThere are also some parallels and contrasts with the Book of Job. Like the Dialogue, Job also considers death as an option in the face of life's contradictions (Job 3:2–13), although he never contemplates suicide. Moreover, Job does not conclude on a note of death: rather, that theme was more present at the outset. The use of irony and satire to probe life's mysteries also feature in both the Dialogue and Job (e.g. Job 9:39–31).\n\nA proverb appearing at the end of the dialogue, \"who is so tall as to ascend to the heavens? who is so broad as to encompass the entire world?\" has several biblical parallels, among which are the opening verse of the proverbs of Agur (Proverbs 30:1); Deuteronomy 30:11-14; Job 11:7-9; and Job 28:12-18.\n\n"}
{"id": "20913753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20913753", "title": "Drama", "text": "Drama\n\nDrama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance: a play, opera, mime, ballet, etc, performed in a theatre, or on radio or television. Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's \"Poetics\" (c. 335 BC)—the earliest work of dramatic theory.\nThe term \"drama\" comes from a Greek word meaning \"action\" (Classical Greek: , \"drama\"), which is derived from \"I do\" (Classical Greek: , \"drao\"). The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. \n\nIn English (as was the analogous case in many other European languages), the word \"play\" or \"game\" (translating the Anglo-Saxon \"pleġan\" or Latin \"ludus\") was the standard term used to describe drama until William Shakespeare's time—just as its creator was a \"play-maker\" rather than a \"dramatist\" and the building was a \"play-house\" rather than a \"theatre\". \n\nThe use of \"drama\" in a more narrow sense to designate a specific \"type\" of play dates from the modern era. \"Drama\" in this sense refers to a play that is \"neither\" a comedy nor a tragedy—for example, Zola's \"Thérèse Raquin\" (1873) or Chekhov's \"Ivanov\" (1887). It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries, along with film studies, adopted to describe \"drama\" as a genre within their respective media. \"Radio drama\" has been used in both senses—originally transmitted in a live performance, it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio.\n\nThe enactment of drama in theatre, performed by actors on a stage before an audience, presupposes collaborative modes of production and a collective form of reception. The structure of dramatic texts, unlike other forms of literature, is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception. \n\nMime is a form of drama where the action of a story is told only through the movement of the body. Drama can be combined with music: the dramatic text in opera is generally sung throughout; as for in some ballets dance \"expresses or imitates emotion, character, and narrative action\". Musicals include both spoken dialogue and songs; and some forms of drama have incidental music or musical accompaniment underscoring the dialogue (melodrama and Japanese Nō, for example). Closet drama describes a form that is intended to be read, rather than performed. In improvisation, the drama does not pre-exist the moment of performance; performers devise a dramatic script spontaneously before an audience.\n\nWestern drama originates in classical Greece. The theatrical culture of the city-state of Athens produced three genres of drama: tragedy, comedy, and the satyr play. Their origins remain obscure, though by the 5th century BC they were institutionalised in competitions held as part of festivities celebrating the god Dionysus. Historians know the names of many ancient Greek dramatists, not least Thespis, who is credited with the innovation of an actor (\"\"hypokrites\") who speaks (rather than sings) and impersonates a character (rather than speaking in his own person), while interacting with the chorus and its leader (\"coryphaeus\"\"), who were a traditional part of the performance of non-dramatic poetry (dithyrambic, lyric and epic).\n\nOnly a small fraction of the work of five dramatists, however, has survived to this day: we have a small number of complete texts by the tragedians Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, and the comic writers Aristophanes and, from the late 4th century, Menander. Aeschylus' historical tragedy \"The Persians\" is the oldest surviving drama, although when it won first prize at the City Dionysia competition in 472 BC, he had been writing plays for more than 25 years. The competition (\"\"agon\") for tragedies may have begun as early as 534 BC; official records (\"didaskaliai\"\") begin from 501 BC when the satyr play was introduced. Tragic dramatists were required to present a tetralogy of plays (though the individual works were not necessarily connected by story or theme), which usually consisted of three tragedies and one satyr play (though exceptions were made, as with Euripides' \"Alcestis\" in 438 BC). Comedy was officially recognized with a prize in the competition from 487 to 486 BC.\n\nFive comic dramatists competed at the City Dionysia (though during the Peloponnesian War this may have been reduced to three), each offering a single comedy. Ancient Greek comedy is traditionally divided between \"old comedy\" (5th century BC), \"middle comedy\" (4th century BC) and \"new comedy\" (late 4th century to 2nd BC).\n\nFollowing the expansion of the Roman Republic (509–27 BC) into several Greek territories between 270–240 BC, Rome encountered Greek drama. From the later years of the republic and by means of the Roman Empire (27 BC-476 AD), theatre spread west across Europe, around the Mediterranean and reached England; Roman theatre was more varied, extensive and sophisticated than that of any culture before it.\n\nWhile Greek drama continued to be performed throughout the Roman period, the year 240 BC marks the beginning of regular Roman drama. From the beginning of the empire, however, interest in full-length drama declined in favour of a broader variety of theatrical entertainments. The first important works of Roman literature were the tragedies and comedies that Livius Andronicus wrote from 240 BC. Five years later, Gnaeus Naevius also began to write drama. No plays from either writer have survived. While both dramatists composed in both genres, Andronicus was most appreciated for his tragedies and Naevius for his comedies; their successors tended to specialise in one or the other, which led to a separation of the subsequent development of each type of drama.\n\nBy the beginning of the 2nd century BC, drama was firmly established in Rome and a guild of writers (\"collegium poetarum\") had been formed. The Roman comedies that have survived are all \"fabula palliata\" (comedies based on Greek subjects) and come from two dramatists: Titus Maccius Plautus (Plautus) and Publius Terentius Afer (Terence). In re-working the Greek originals, the Roman comic dramatists abolished the role of the chorus in dividing the drama into episodes and introduced musical accompaniment to its dialogue (between one-third of the dialogue in the comedies of Plautus and two-thirds in those of Terence). The action of all scenes is set in the exterior location of a street and its complications often follow from eavesdropping.\n\nPlautus, the more popular of the two, wrote between 205 and 184 BC and twenty of his comedies survive, of which his farces are best known; he was admired for the wit of his dialogue and his use of a variety of poetic meters. All of the six comedies that Terence wrote between 166 and 160 BC have survived; the complexity of his plots, in which he often combined several Greek originals, was sometimes denounced, but his double-plots enabled a sophisticated presentation of contrasting human behaviour. No early Roman tragedy survives, though it was highly regarded in its day; historians know of three early tragedians—Quintus Ennius, Marcus Pacuvius, and Lucius Accius.\n\nFrom the time of the empire, the work of two tragedians survives—one is an unknown author, while the other is the Stoic philosopher Seneca. Nine of Seneca's tragedies survive, all of which are \"fabula crepidata\" (tragedies adapted from Greek originals); his \"Phaedra\", for example, was based on Euripides' \"Hippolytus\". Historians do not know who wrote the only extant example of the \"fabula praetexta\" (tragedies based on Roman subjects), \"Octavia\", but in former times it was mistakenly attributed to Seneca due to his appearance as a character in the tragedy.\n\nBeginning in the early Middle Ages, churches staged dramatised versions of biblical events, known as liturgical dramas, to enliven annual celebrations. The earliest example is the Easter trope \"Whom do you Seek? (Quem-Quaeritis)\" (c. 925). Two groups would sing responsively in Latin, though no impersonation of characters was involved. By the 11th century, it had spread through Europe to Russia, Scandinavia, and Italy; excluding Islamic-era Spain.\n\nIn the 10th century, Hrosvitha wrote six plays in Latin modeled on Terence's comedies, but which treated religious subjects. Her plays are the first known to be composed by a female dramatist and the first identifiable Western drama of the post-Classical era. Later, Hildegard of Bingen wrote a musical drama, \"Ordo Virtutum\" (c. 1155).\n\nOne of the most famous of the early secular plays is the courtly pastoral \"Robin and Marion\", written in the 13th century in French by Adam de la Halle. \"The Interlude of the Student and the Girl\" (c. 1300), one of the earliest known in English, seems to be the closest in tone and form to the contemporaneous French farces, such as \"The Boy and the Blind Man.\"\n\nA large number of plays survive from France and Germany in the late Middle Ages, when some type of religious drama was performed in nearly every European country. Many of these plays contained comedy, devils, villains, and clowns. In England, trade guilds began to perform vernacular \"mystery plays,\" which were composed of long cycles of a large number of playlets or \"pageants,\" of which four are extant: York (48 plays), Chester (24), Wakefield (32) and the so-called \"N-Town\" (42). \"The Second Shepherds' Play\" from the Wakefield cycle is a farcical story of a stolen sheep that its protagonist, Mak, tries to pass off as his new-born child asleep in a crib; it ends when the shepherds from whom he has stolen are summoned to the Nativity of Jesus.\n\nMorality plays (a modern term) emerged as a distinct dramatic form around 1400 and flourished in the early Elizabethan era in England. Characters were often used to represent different ethical ideals. \"Everyman\", for example, includes such figures as Good Deeds, Knowledge and Strength, and this characterisation reinforces the conflict between good and evil for the audience. \"The Castle of Perseverance\" (c. 1400—1425) depicts an archetypal figure's progress from birth through to death. \"Horestes\" (c. 1567), a late \"hybrid morality\" and one of the earliest examples of an English revenge play, brings together the classical story of Orestes with a Vice from the medieval allegorical tradition, alternating comic, slapstick scenes with serious, tragic ones. Also important in this period were the folk dramas of the Mummers Play, performed during the Christmas season. Court masques were particularly popular during the reign of Henry VIII.\n\nOne of the great flowerings of drama in England occurred in the 16th and 17th centuries. Many of these plays were written in verse, particularly iambic pentameter. In addition to Shakespeare, such authors as Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Middleton, and Ben Jonson were prominent playwrights during this period. As in the medieval period, historical plays celebrated the lives of past kings, enhancing the image of the Tudor monarchy. Authors of this period drew some of their storylines from Greek mythology and Roman mythology or from the plays of eminent Roman playwrights such as Plautus and Terence.\n\nRestoration comedy refers to English comedies written and performed in England during the Restoration period from 1660 to 1710. Comedy of manners is used as a synonym of Restoration comedy. After public theatre had been banned by the Puritan regime, the re-opening of the theatres in 1660 with the Restoration of Charles II signalled a renaissance of English drama. Restoration comedy is known for its sexual explicitness, urbane, cosmopolitan wit, up-to-the-minute topical writing, and crowded and bustling plots. Its dramatists stole freely from the contemporary French and Spanish stage, from English Jacobean and Caroline plays, and even from Greek and Roman classical comedies, combining the various plotlines in adventurous ways. Resulting differences of tone in a single play were appreciated rather than frowned on, as the audience prized \"variety\" within as well as between plays. Restoration comedy peaked twice. The genre came to spectacular maturity in the mid-1670s with an extravaganza of aristocratic comedies. Twenty lean years followed this short golden age, although the achievement of the first professional female playwright, Aphra Behn, in the 1680s is an important exception. In the mid-1690s, a brief second Restoration comedy renaissance arose, aimed at a wider audience. The comedies of the golden 1670s and 1690s peak times are significantly different from each other.\n\nThe unsentimental or \"hard\" comedies of John Dryden, William Wycherley, and George Etherege reflected the atmosphere at Court and celebrated with frankness an aristocratic macho lifestyle of unremitting sexual intrigue and conquest. The Earl of Rochester, real-life Restoration rake, courtier and poet, is flatteringly portrayed in Etherege's \"The Man of Mode\" (1676) as a riotous, witty, intellectual, and sexually irresistible aristocrat, a template for posterity's idea of the glamorous Restoration rake (actually never a very common character in Restoration comedy). The single play that does most to support the charge of obscenity levelled then and now at Restoration comedy is probably Wycherley's masterpiece \"The Country Wife\" (1675), whose title contains a lewd pun and whose notorious \"china scene\" is a series of sustained double entendres.\n\nDuring the second wave of Restoration comedy in the 1690s, the \"softer\" comedies of William Congreve and John Vanbrugh set out to appeal to more socially diverse audience with a strong middle-class element, as well as to female spectators. The comic focus shifts from young lovers outwitting the older generation to the vicissitudes of marital relations. In Congreve's \"Love for Love\" (1695) and \"The Way of the World\" (1700), the give-and-take set pieces of couples testing their attraction for one another have mutated into witty prenuptial debates on the eve of marriage, as in the latter's famous \"Proviso\" scene. Vanbrugh's \"The Provoked Wife\" (1697) has a light touch and more humanly recognisable characters, while \"The Relapse\" (1696) has been admired for its throwaway wit and the characterisation of Lord Foppington, an extravagant and affected burlesque fop with a dark side. The tolerance for Restoration comedy even in its modified form was running out by the end of the 17th century, as public opinion turned to respectability and seriousness even faster than the playwrights did. At the much-anticipated all-star première in 1700 of \"The Way of the World\", Congreve's first comedy for five years, the audience showed only moderate enthusiasm for that subtle and almost melancholy work. The comedy of sex and wit was about to be replaced by sentimental comedy and the drama of exemplary morality.\n\nThe pivotal and innovative contributions of the 19th-century Norwegian dramatist Henrik Ibsen and the 20th-century German theatre practitioner Bertolt Brecht dominate modern drama; each inspired a tradition of imitators, which include many of the greatest playwrights of the modern era. The works of both playwrights are, in their different ways, both modernist and realist, incorporating formal experimentation, meta-theatricality, and social critique. In terms of the traditional theoretical discourse of genre, Ibsen's work has been described as the culmination of \"liberal tragedy\", while Brecht's has been aligned with an historicised comedy.\n\nOther important playwrights of the modern era include Antonin Artaud, August Strindberg, Anton Chekhov, Frank Wedekind, Maurice Maeterlinck, Federico García Lorca, Eugene O'Neill, Luigi Pirandello, George Bernard Shaw, Ernst Toller, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, Jean Genet, Eugène Ionesco, Samuel Beckett, Harold Pinter, Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Dario Fo, Heiner Müller, and Caryl Churchill.\n\nWestern opera is a dramatic art form that arose during the Renaissance in an attempt to revive the classical Greek drama in which dialogue, dance, and song were combined. Being strongly intertwined with western classical music, the opera has undergone enormous changes in the past four centuries and it is an important form of theatre until this day. Noteworthy is the major influence of the German 19th-century composer Richard Wagner on the opera tradition. In his view, there was no proper balance between music and theatre in the operas of his time, because the music seemed to be more important than the dramatic aspects in these works. To restore the connection with the classical drama, he entirely renewed the operatic form to emphasize the equal importance of music and drama in works that he called \"music dramas\".\n\nChinese opera has seen a more conservative development over a somewhat longer period of time.\n\nPantomime (informally panto), is a type of musical comedy stage production, designed for family entertainment. It was developed in England and is still performed throughout the United Kingdom, generally during the Christmas and New Year season and, to a lesser extent, in other English-speaking countries. Modern pantomime includes songs, gags, slapstick comedy and dancing, employs gender-crossing actors, and combines topical humour with a story loosely based on a well-known fairy tale, fable or folk tale. It is a participatory form of theatre, in which the audience is expected to sing along with certain parts of the music and shout out phrases to the performers.\n\nThese stories follow in the tradition of fables and folk tales. Usually, there is a lesson learned, and with some help from the audience, the hero/heroine saves the day. This kind of play uses stock characters seen in masque and again commedia dell'arte, these characters include the villain (doctore), the clown/servant (Arlechino/Harlequin/buttons), the lovers etc. These plays usually have an emphasis on moral dilemmas, and good always triumphs over evil, this kind of play is also very entertaining making it a very effective way of reaching many people.\n\nPantomime has a long theatrical history in Western culture dating back to classical theatre. It developed partly from the 16th century commedia dell'arte tradition of Italy, as well as other European and British stage traditions, such as 17th-century masques and music hall. An important part of the pantomime, until the late 19th century, was the harlequinade. Outside Britain the word \"pantomime\" is usually used to mean miming, rather than the theatrical form discussed here.\n\nMime is a theatrical medium where the action of a story is told through the movement of the body, without the use of speech. Performance of mime occurred in Ancient Greece, and the word is taken from a single masked dancer called \"Pantomimus\", although their performances were not necessarily silent. In Medieval Europe, early forms of mime, such as mummer plays and later dumbshows, evolved. In the early nineteenth century Paris, Jean-Gaspard Deburau solidified the many attributes that we have come to know in modern times, including the silent figure in whiteface.\n\nJacques Copeau, strongly influenced by Commedia dell'arte and Japanese Noh theatre, used masks in the training of his actors. Étienne Decroux, a pupil of his, was highly influenced by this and started exploring and developing the possibilities of mime and refined corporeal mime into a highly sculptural form, taking it outside of the realms of naturalism. Jacques Lecoq contributed significantly to the development of mime and physical theatre with his training methods.\n\nWhile some ballet emphasises \"the lines and patterns of movement itself\" dramatic dance \"expresses or imitates emotion, character, and narrative action\". Such ballets are theatrical works that have characters and \"tell a story\", Dance movements in ballet \"are often closely related to everyday forms of physical expression, [so that] there is an expressive quality inherent in nearly all dancing\", and this is used to convey both action and emotions; mime is also used. Examples include Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's \"Swan Lake\", which tells the story of Odette, a princess turned into a swan by an evil sorcerer's curse, Sergei Prokofiev's ballet \"Romeo and Juliet\", based on Shakespeare's famous play, and Igor Stravinsky's \"Petrushka\", which tells tells the story of the loves and jealousies of three puppets.\n\nCreative drama includes dramatic activities and games used primarily in educational settings with children. Its roots in the United States began in the early 1900s. Winifred Ward is considered to be the founder of creative drama in education, establishing the first academic use of drama in Evanston, Illinois.\n\nThe earliest form of Indian drama was the Sanskrit drama. Between the 1st century AD and the 10th was a period of relative peace in the history of India during which hundreds of plays were written. With the Islamic conquests that began in the 10th and 11th centuries, theatre was discouraged or forbidden entirely. Later, in an attempt to re-assert indigenous values and ideas, village theatre was encouraged across the subcontinent, developing in a large number of regional languages from the 15th to the 19th centuries. Modern Indian theatre developed during the period of colonial rule under the British Empire, from the mid-19th century until the mid-20th.\n\nThe earliest-surviving fragments of Sanskrit drama date from the 1st century AD. The wealth of archeological evidence from earlier periods offers no indication of the existence of a tradition of theatre. The ancient \"Vedas\" (hymns from between 1500 and 1000 BC that are among the earliest examples of literature in the world) contain no hint of it (although a small number are composed in a form of dialogue) and the rituals of the Vedic period do not appear to have developed into theatre. The \"Mahābhāṣya\" by Patañjali contains the earliest reference to what may have been the seeds of Sanskrit drama. This treatise on grammar from 140 BC provides a feasible date for the beginnings of theatre in India.\n\nThe major source of evidence for Sanskrit theatre is \"A Treatise on Theatre\" (\"Nātyaśāstra\"), a compendium whose date of composition is uncertain (estimates range from 200 BC to 200 AD) and whose authorship is attributed to Bharata Muni. The \"Treatise\" is the most complete work of dramaturgy in the ancient world. It addresses acting, dance, music, dramatic construction, architecture, costuming, make-up, props, the organisation of companies, the audience, competitions, and offers a mythological account of the origin of theatre.\n\nIts drama is regarded as the highest achievement of Sanskrit literature. It utilised stock characters, such as the hero (\"nayaka\"), heroine (\"nayika\"), or clown (\"vidusaka\"). Actors may have specialised in a particular type. It was patronized by the kings as well as village assemblies. Famous early playwrights include Bhasa, Kalidasa (famous for \"Vikrama and Urvashi\", \"Malavika and Agnimitra\", and \"The Recognition of Shakuntala\"), Śudraka (famous for \"The Little Clay Cart\"), Asvaghosa, Daṇḍin, and Emperor Harsha (famous for \"Nagananda\", \"Ratnavali,\" and \"Priyadarsika\"). \"Śakuntalā\" (in English translation) influenced Goethe's \"Faust\" (1808–1832).\n\nRabindranath Tagore was a pioneering modern playwright who wrote plays noted for their exploration and questioning of nationalism, identity, spiritualism and material greed. His plays are written in Bengali and include \"Chitra\" (\"Chitrangada\", 1892), \"The King of the Dark Chamber\" (\"Raja\", 1910), \"The Post Office\" (\"Dakghar\", 1913), and \"Red Oleander\" (\"Raktakarabi\", 1924).\nGirish Karnad is a noted playwright, who has written a number of plays that use history and mythology, to critique and problematize ideas and ideals that are of contemporary relevance. Karnad's numerous plays such as \"Tughlaq\", \"Hayavadana\", \"Taledanda\", and \"Naga-Mandala\" are significant contributions to Indian drama. Vijay Tendulkar and Mahesh Dattani are amongst the major Indian playwrights of the 20th century. Mohan Rakesh in Hindi and Danish Iqbal in Urdu are considered architects of new age Drama. Mohan Rakesh's Aadhe Adhoore and Danish Iqbal's \"Dara Shikoh\" are considered modern classics.\n\nUrdu Drama evolved from the prevailing dramatic traditions of North India shaping Rahas or Raas as practiced by exponents like Nawab Wajid Ali Shah (1822 – 1887) of Awadh. His dramatic experiments led to the famous Inder Sabha of Amanat and later this tradition took the shape of Parsi Theatre. Agha Hashr Kashmiri is the culmination of this tradition.\n\nUrdu theatre tradition has greatly influenced modern Indian theatre. Theatre has flourished in Urdu (which was called Hindi by early writers), along with Gujrati, Marathi, and Bengali. Urdu drama has had an important influence on Bombay Film industry and all the early works of Urdu theatre (performed by Parsi Companies) were made into films. Urdu dramatic tradition has existed for more than a 100 years.\n\nProf Hasan, Ghulam Jeelani, J.N,Kaushal, Shameem Hanfi, Jameel Shaidayi, etc. belong to the old generation, contemporary writers like Danish Iqbal, Sayeed Alam, Shahid Anwar, Iqbal Niyazi, and Anwar are a few postmodern playwrights actively contributing in the field of Urdu Drama.\n\nSayeed Alam is known for his wit and humour and more particularly for plays like 'Ghalib in New Delhi', 'Big B' and many other works, which are regularly staged for large audiences. \"Maulana Azad\" is his most important play both for its content and style.\n\nDanish Iqbal's play \"Dara Shikoh\" directed by M. S. Sathyu is a modern classic that uses newer theatre techniques and a contemporary perspective. His other plays are \"Sahir\". on the famous lyricist and revolutionary poet. \"Kuchh Ishq kiya Kuchh Kaam\" is another play written by Danish which is basically a Celebration of Faiz's poetry, featuring events from the early part of his life, particularly the events and incidents of pre-partition days which shaped his life and ideals. \"Chand Roz Aur Meri Jaan\" – another play inspired from Faiz's letters written from various jails during the Rawalpindi Conspiracy days. He has written 14 other plays including \"Dilli Jo Ek Shehr Thaa\" and \"Main Gaya Waqt Nahin hoon\". Shahid's \"Three B\" is also a significant play. He has been associated with many groups like 'Natwa' and others. Zaheer Anwar has kept the flag of Urdu theatre flying in Kolkata. Unlike the writers of previous generation Sayeed, Shahid, Danish Iqbal and Zaheer do not write bookish plays but their work is a product of performing tradition. Iqbal Niyazi of Mumbai has written several plays in Urdu, his play \"AUR KITNE JALYANWALA BAUGH?\" won a National award other awards. Hence this is the only generation after Amanat and Agha Hashr who actually write for stage and not for libraries.\n\nChinese theatre has a long and complex history. Today it is often called Chinese opera although this normally refers specifically to the popular form known as Beijing opera and Kunqu; there have been many other forms of theatre in China, such as zaju.\n\nJapanese Nō drama is a serious dramatic form that combines drama, music, and dance into a complete aesthetic performance experience. It developed in the 14th and 15th centuries and has its own musical instruments and performance techniques, which were often handed down from father to son. The performers were generally male (for both male and female roles), although female amateurs also perform Nō dramas. Nō drama was supported by the government, and particularly the military, with many military commanders having their own troupes and sometimes performing themselves. It is still performed in Japan today.\n\nKyōgen is the comic counterpart to Nō drama. It concentrates more on dialogue and less on music, although Nō instrumentalists sometimes appear also in Kyōgen. Kabuki drama, developed from the 17th century, is another comic form, which includes dance.\n\n"}

As the popularity of the game grew throughout the late-1970s and 1980s, it became referenced in popular culture more frequently. The complement of games, films and cultural references based on \"Dungeons & Dragons\" or similar fantasies, characters, and adventures became ubiquitous after the end of the 1970s.\n\n\"Dungeons & Dragons\", and tabletop role-playing games in general, have exerted a deep and persistent impact on the development of all types of video games, from \"first-person shooters to real-time strategy games and massively multiplayer online games\", which in turn play a significant and ongoing role in modern popular culture.\n\nIn online culture, the term \"dungeon\" has since come to mean a virtual location where people can meet and collaborate. Hence, multi-user dungeons emerged throughout the 1970s and 1980s as a form of social networks or a social virtual reality. By creating a means for players to assemble and explore an imaginary world, the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" rules provided a transition from fantasy literary settings, such as those of author J. R. R. Tolkien, to fully virtual worlds.\n\nPublic figures who play or have played \"Dungeons & Dragons\" include comedians Stephen Colbert and Chris Hardwick, musician Moby, and actors Vin Diesel, Matthew Lillard, Mike Myers, Patton Oswalt, Wil Wheaton, and Robin Williams.\n\nIndependent fiction derived from the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" game appeared with the \"Endless Quest\" series of books, published by TSR, Inc between 1982 and 1987. The \"Endless Quest\" books provided a form of interactive fiction in the style of the Choose Your Own Adventure series. The continuing success of \"Dungeons & Dragons\" then sparked an even more extensive series of novels, also published by TSR, Inc. The first of these were based upon the \"Dragonlance\" campaign setting, and were released in 1984. There proved to be a lucrative market for these works, and by the 2000s a significant portion of all fantasy paperbacks were being published by Wizards of the Coast, the American game company that acquired TSR, Inc in 1997.\n\nThe impact of \"Dungeons & Dragons\" on players and culture has inspired reflective non-fiction works:\n\nSeveral characters created for playing Dungeons & Dragons, or games derived from \"Dungeons & Dragons\", have later spawned popular fantasy series. Other novels make off-hand references to the game:\n\nBegun in 1986, the comic books \"The Adventurers\" and \"Redfox\" were inspired by \"Dungeons & Dragons\". Several commercial comic strips are based entirely upon the game or make reference to the game in specific panels.\n\nSeveral films include instances of characters playing the game of \"Dungeons & Dragons\". There have also been three feature films released that were based upon the game: \"Dungeons & Dragons\" (2000), \"\" (2005), and \"\" (2012). As of 2015, Warner Bros. Pictures, RatPac-Dune Entertainment, Sweetpea Entertainment, Vertigo Entertainment, Hasbro Studios and Allspark Pictures are currently developing a new \"Dungeons & Dragons\" film scheduled for release on July 23, 2021. The film will reportedly star Ansel Elgort and be directed by Rob Letterman.\n\nThe CBS network ran a Saturday morning cartoon series called \"Dungeons & Dragons\", in which a group of teenagers visiting a \"Dungeons and Dragons\"-themed theme park dark ride are magically transported into the fantasy world of \"Dungeons and Dragons\". The show included the voice talents of Willie Aames of \"Eight is Enough\", and ran from 1983 to 1985.\n\n\"Dungeons & Dragons\" is also referenced in a variety of television programs:\n\n\n\"Dungeons & Dragons\" is referenced in popular music:\n\n\"Dungeons & Dragons\" is referenced in popular video games:\n\n\"Borderlands 2\" downloadable content \"Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep\" involves Tiny Tina serving as a game master of \"Bunkers and Badasses\", the \"Borderlands version of Dungeons & Dragons\".\n\nCanadian video game designer and developer Merritt k created the 2015 Twine game \"(ASMR) Vin Diesel DMing a Game of D&D Just For You\" based on American actor Vin Diesel's \"D&D\" fandom.\n\nIn \"\", there is a part where the player can choose the option for Chloe to join in on a \"D&D\" campaign.\n\nStephen Colbert developed an intense interest in the game during his youth, which he later credited for his talent at character creation. Ethan Gilsdorf credited the game for bestowing upon him \"gifts of creativity and self-actualization\". Actor Vin Diesel, in his introduction to the book \"Thirty Years of Adventure\", wrote that he was \"attracted to the artistic outlet the game provided\" and that the game was \"a training ground for our imagination and an opportunity to explore our own identities\". Vin Diesel, Mike Myers, and Robin Williams also participated in the 2006 Worldwide Dungeons & Dragons Game Day, demonstrating that the game was then still a lively and active hobby.\n\nDirector Chris Weitz pointed out that there \"are a lot of people who played and are horribly embarrassed about it and won't admit it, because it's part of their lives they put behind\". He developed a fervent interest in the game, even greater than in making movies, and said the experience \"had such an influence on his life\". Director Jon Favreau was drawn into the game by the fantasy elements and the sense of story, saying \"it gave me a really strong background in imagination, storytelling, understanding how to create tone and a sense of balance\".\n\nPolitical reporter John J. Miller said that \"Dungeons & Dragons\" was a big part of his life during his school years, and argued that, \"there's a lot to admire about \"D&D\" and what it can do for kids by encouraging them to read, do math, and think creatively\". Fantasy author China Miéville said that playing \"Dungeons & Dragons\" as a youth was one of the most enduring influences on his writing. The two things that particularly influenced him were \"the mania for cataloging the fantastic\" and \"the weird fetish for systematization\", in that everything is reduced to \"game stats\". In contrast, author Mark Barrowcliffe considers his years playing \"Dungeons & Dragons\" to be a wasted youth and all of the players to be nerds. He has tried to put the experience behind him.\n\nThe following public figures have stated that they play, or have played, \"Dungeons & Dragons\", indicating the game's broad appeal to a diverse range of talented individuals.\n"}

It was written by Ben Elton, Rik Mayall and Lise Mayer, and directed by Paul Jackson. It was first aired on BBC2 on 14 December 1982 and was the final episode of the first series.\n\nWith none of the quartet noticing a medieval execution in their back garden, there is initial tranquility in the house, with Neil randomly hitting himself in the face with a frying pan, and Vyvyan reading one of Rick's \"SS Death Camp Battalion go to Monte Cassino for the Massacre\" war comics, leading to an argument with Rick over the comic's content. After Neil prepares to go on a shopping trip for \"Everything except Green Globules and Super Mousse\", Vyvyan mentions that he had concocted a 'homicidal axe-wielding maniac' potion disguised in a Coca-Cola can, that transforms the drinker into said person, under the guise of a \"cure for not being a homicidal axe-wielding maniac\", to which Vyvyan mentions the potential size of the market for such an invention.\n\nHowever, the monsoon-like rain outside soon traps everyone in the house and a game of hide and seek gets underway to pass the time. During this time, the house takes on a Narnia-esque feel, with a lion tamer in Mike's bedroom and Vyvyan finding a witch in a sleigh lurking in a new world at the back of the wardrobe where he was hiding. But all that - plus the sharks at the window and the arson attack on Rick's bedroom caused by Vyvyan - becomes irrelevant as Mr. Balowski arrives, unwittingly drinks Vyvyan's potion, and goes on the hunt. As Mike, Rick and Vyvyan prepare to kill Neil for food with an electric hedge trimmer, Mr. Balowski breaks down the door to Neil's room with an axe, leading to the group trying to escape him. After tricking Mr. Balowski into entering Mike's room, which was being rented out to Bobby the Lion Tamer and his man-eating lions, the group notice that the flood waters are subsiding. The episode ended by showing Vyvyan's hamster, SPG, floating on a discarded McEwan's Export can on the flood waters, as if to prove he had survived Vyvyan's angry outburst which led to him throwing him outside.\n\nAs with all episodes of \"The Young Ones\", the main four characters were student flatmates Mike (Christopher Ryan); Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson); Rick (Rik Mayall) and Neil (Nigel Planer). The episode also features their landlord Jerzei Balowski (Alexei Sayle), a character who was appearing for the second time during the first series, and would appear once more in total.\n\nThis episode was the only one of the dozen made not to feature a band performing mid-show; the lion-tamer provided the \"cabaret\" instead. \n\nWhile the boys are playing hide-and-seek, Vyvyan hides in a wardrobe and ends in a Narnia-like world. Mr. Balowski's axe-murdering condition cause by Vyvyan's potion is a reference to Stephen King's novel, \"The Shining\".\n\nThe monks at the medieval execution at the beginning are chanting 'Dominus ad nauseam', which means '[Discussing] the Lord to [the point of] nausea'. SPG has an olive branch in his mouth at the end, a biblical reference (Genesis 8:11) to the dove in the story of Noah.\n"}
{"id": "512131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=512131", "title": "Focus puller", "text": "Focus puller\n\nA focus puller, or 1st assistant camera, is a member of a film crew's camera department whose primary responsibility is to maintain image sharpness on whatever subject or action is being filmed.\n\n\"Pulling focus\" or \"rack focusing\" refers to the act of changing the lens's focus distance setting in correspondence to a moving subject's physical distance from the focal plane. For example, if an actor moves from 8m to 3m away from the focal plane within a shot, the focus puller will change the distance setting on the lens during the take in precise relation to the changing position of the actor. Additionally, the focus puller may shift focus from one subject to another within the frame, as dictated by the specific requirements of the shot.\n\nA good focus puller will have an intimate knowledge of cinematographic and optical theory. Depending on the parameters of a given shot, there is often very little room for error. As such, the role of a focus puller is extremely important within the realm of a film production; a \"soft\" image will, in most circumstances, be considered unusable, since there is no way to fix such an error in post-production. One must also consider that an actor may not be able to duplicate his or her best performance in a subsequent take, so the focus puller is expected to perform flawlessly on every take. Because of these factors, some production personnel consider the focus puller to have the most difficult job on set.\n\nBritish cinematographer Oliver Stapleton has written:\nDuring production, 1st ACs are also responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of all camera equipment and accessories, including; lenses, filters, batteries, film magazines/recording media, matte boxes, etc., as well as configuring the camera and its accessories in multiple ways for different setups. 1st ACs arrive on set before the director, director of photography (DoP) and camera operator, and ensures the camera and all required lenses are prepared for the day's shoot. During filming, the 1st AC is responsible for moving the camera to each setup as directed by the Director of Photography. On larger budget productions, the camera is usually mounted on a dolly for most of the day, which is operated by the Dolly Grip. At the end of each shooting day, 1st ACs clean the equipment and pack it up in preparation for the next day. If there is a problem with the rushes (such as a scratch on the film), the focus puller communicates with the film lab to fix any faults with the camera or film stock.\n\nSharp focus is fundamental to reproducing a realistic, appealing image, and a viewer's attention is automatically drawn to sharper areas. When done correctly, good pulling goes mostly unnoticed by the audience.\n\nThe shooting of a scene typically begins with a blocking rehearsal, in which the various actors' positions are established. During the rehearsal, the 2nd AC lays tape marks on the floor at all points an actor pauses movement. The actors then leave set to go through hair and makeup, and stand-ins come in to take their places at these various positions for the purposes of lighting, framing, and focus-mark setting. Once a camera position is established by the director of photography and camera operator, the 1st AC begins to measure the various distances between the actors' marks and the focal plane of the camera. These distances are recorded in a series of grease pencil/pen marks on the focus barrel of the lens, and/or the marking disc on the follow focus device. Using the stand-ins or 2nd AC, marks are checked through the viewfinder and/or the onboard monitor for accuracy. Marks may be repositioned in order to provide specific framing desired, and the 1st AC must be aware of this and re-measure/re-set his marks accordingly. Additionally, the 1st AC may have the 2nd AC lay down specific distance marks on the floor which will be referenced during the take as actors move between their marks, in order to assist in accurately adjusting the focus to the correct intermediate distances.\n\nWhen the actors return to set, there is usually a rehearsal for camera in which the focus puller and operator will practice the shot and make sure everything has been set up properly. During a take, the focus puller modifies the focus based on the dialog, movement of the actors or subject, movement of the camera, the DoP's directions, and compensates on the fly for actors missing their marks or any unforeseen movement. In cases where an obstruction prevents the focus puller from seeing all his marks, he may request the 2nd AC call the marks for him over a 2-way radio during the shot. In some situations, such as on long lenses, wide apertures, very close distances, or any combination of the three, a subject moving even a few millimeters may require immediate and very precise focus correction.\n\nAfter a take, if the focus puller feels he's made a mistake—be it a timing error, a missed mark, or any other issue which may have rendered some part of the take \"soft,\" he or she will typically report this to the operator (who most likely noticed the error in the viewfinder) or director of photography, and may ask for another take if another wasn't already planned.\n\nTraditionally, the focus puller used only his marks and his own well-developed sense of distance estimation to achieve good results. Over the last decade, the increased use of digital cameras, higher-resolution video taps and/or on-camera monitors have provided focus pullers with additional tools to help maintain proper focus. A high-definition monitor can be particularly useful when a fast-paced production simply does not allow time for the focus puller to set and check all marks that may be needed, or if no rehearsal will be provided.\n\nProfessional 1st ACs have many tricks for pulling focus in difficult situations or when accurate measurement is impossible. Often, before a scene is even rehearsed or established, the 1st AC will take surveying measurements of the general environment in order to have a good idea of the distance between reference points, such as patterns on the floor or walls, furniture, and whatever else might be around. These reference measurements can be used to quickly establish rough distances between the camera and the subject in chaotic shooting circumstances.\n\nIn addition to keen eyesight, reflexes, and intuition, the focus puller's primary tools are a cloth or fiberglass tape measure, steel tape measure, laser rangefinder, and in some cases an on-camera ultrasonic rangefinder which provides a real-time distance readout mounted on the side of the mattebox or camera body. In setups where the focus puller cannot touch the camera, such as on steadicam or crane shots, he or she will use a remote follow focus system, though some focus pullers prefer using a remote system at all times.\n\nAt the end of a successfully shot scene, the focus puller will be called upon to \"Check the gate\". This involves removing the lens and inspecting, with the aid of a flashlight and magnifying glass, the aperture to which the film is held during exposure. The focus puller is looking for any foreign bodies, e.g. hair, bits of broken film, fluff etc., that would show on the film and therefore ruin the scene that has just been filmed. This obviously is only relevant to shooting on film: however, a similar task is required for digital movie cameras (although not nearly as often) which involves checking the sensor.\n\nThe 1st AC reports to the director of photography, works alongside the camera operator, and oversees the 2nd assistant camera (also known as the \"clapper loader\") and any other members of the camera department.\n\n"}

{"id": "1749257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1749257", "title": "Franz Xaver Winterhalter", "text": "Franz Xaver Winterhalter\n\nFranz Xaver Winterhalter (20 April 1805 – 8 July 1873) was a German painter and lithographer, known for his portraits of royalty in the mid-19th century. His name has become associated with fashionable court portraiture. Among his best known works are \"Empress Eugénie Surrounded by her Ladies in Waiting\" (1855) and the portraits he made of Empress Elisabeth of Austria (1865).\n\nFranz Xaver Winterhalter was born in the small village of Menzenschwand, (now part of Sankt Blasien), in Germany's Black Forest in the Electorate of Baden, on 20 April 1805. He was the sixth child of Fidel Winterhalter (1773–1863), a farmer and resin producer in the village, and his wife Eva Meyer (1765–1838), a member of a long established Menzenschwand family. His father was of peasant stock and was a powerful influence in his life. Of the eight brothers and sisters, only four survived infancy. Throughout his life Franz Xaver remained very close to his family, in particular to his brother Hermann (1808–1891), who was also a painter.\n\nAfter attending school at a Benedictine monastery in St. Blasien, Winterhalter left Menzenschwand in 1818 at the age of 13 to study drawing and engraving. He trained as a draughtsman and lithographer in the workshop of Karl Ludwig Schüler (1785–1852) in Freiburg im Breisgau. In 1823, at the age of 18, he went to Munich, sponsored by the industrialist Baron von Eichtal (1775–1850). In 1825, he was granted a stipend by Ludwig I, Grand Duke of Baden (1763–1830) and began a course of study at the Academy of Arts in Munich with Peter von Cornelius (1783–1867), whose academic methods made him uncomfortable. Winterhalter found a more congenial mentor in the fashionable portraitist Joseph Stieler (1781–1858). During this time, he supported himself working as lithographer.\n\nWinterhalter entered court circles when in 1828 he became drawing master to Sophie Margravine of Baden, at Karlsruhe. His opportunity to establish himself beyond southern Germany came in 1832 when he was able to travel to Italy, 1833–1834, with the support of Grand Duke Leopold of Baden. In Rome he composed romantic genre scenes in the manner of Louis Léopold Robert and attached himself to the circle of the director of the French Academy, Horace Vernet. On his return to Karlsruhe he painted portraits of the Grand Duke Leopold of Baden and his wife, and was appointed painter to the grand-ducal court.\n\nNevertheless, he left Baden to move to France, where his Italian genre scene \"Il dolce Farniente\" attracted notice at the Salon of 1836. \"Il Decameron\" a year later was also praised; both paintings are academic compositions in the style of Raphael. In the Salon of 1838 he exhibited a portrait of the Prince of Wagram with his young daughter. His career as a portrait painter was soon secured when in the same year he painted Louise Marie of Orleans, Queen of the Belgians, and her son. It was probably through this painting that Winterhalter came to the notice of Maria Amalia of the Two Sicilies, Queen of the French, mother of the Queen of the Belgians.\n\nIn Paris, Winterhalter quickly became fashionable. He was appointed court painter of Louis-Philippe, the king of the French, who commissioned him to paint individual portraits of his large family. Winterhalter would execute more than thirty commissions for him.\n\nThis success earned the painter the reputation of a specialist in dynastic and aristocratic portraiture, skilled in combining likeness with flattery and enlivening official pomp with modern fashion.\n\nHowever, Winterhalter's reputation in artistic circles suffered. The critics, who had praised his debut in the salon of 1836, dismissed him as a painter who could not be taken seriously. This attitude persisted throughout Winterhalter's career, condemning his work to a category of his own in the hierarchy of painting. Winterhalter himself regarded his first royal commissions as a temporary intermission before returning to subject painting and the field of academic respectability, but he was a victim of his own success, and for the rest of his life he worked almost exclusively as a portrait painter. His success in this field made him rich. Winterhalter became an international celebrity enjoying Royal patronage.\n\nAmong his many regal sitters was also Queen Victoria. Winterhalter first visited England in 1842, and returned several times to paint Victoria, Prince Albert and their growing family, painting at least 120 works for them, a large number of which remain in the Royal Collection, on display to the public at Buckingham Palace and other royal residences. Winterhalter also painted a few portraits of the aristocracy in England, mostly members of court circles. The fall of Louis-Philippe in 1848 did not affect the painter's reputation. Winterhalter went to Switzerland and worked in Belgium and England.\n\nPersistence saw Winterhalter survive from the fall of one dynasty to the rise of another. Paris remained his home until a couple of years before his death. A halt in portrait commissions in France allowed him to return to subject painting with \"Florinda\" (1852; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), a joyous celebration of female beauty inspired by a Spanish legend. In the same year his marriage proposal was rejected, and Winterhalter remained a bachelor committed to his work.\n\nAfter the accession of Napoleon III, his popularity grew. From then on, under the Second Empire, Winterhalter became the chief portraitist of the imperial family and court of France. The beautiful French Empress Eugénie became a favorite sitter, and she treated him generously. In 1855 Winterhalter painted his masterpiece: \"The Empress Eugénie Surrounded by her Ladies in Waiting\". He set the French Empress in a pastoral setting gathering flowers in a harmonious circle with her ladies in waiting. The painting was acclaimed, and exhibited in the universal exposition in 1855. It remains Winterhalter's most famous work.\n\nIn 1852, he went to Spain to paint Queen Isabella II with her daughter. Russian aristocratic visitors to Paris also liked to have their portraits executed by the famous master. As the \"Painter of Princes\", Winterhalter was thereafter in constant demand by the courts of Britain (from 1841), Spain, Belgium, Russia, Mexico, the German states, and France. During the 1850s and 1860s, Winterhalter painted a number of important portraits of Polish and Russian aristocrats. In 1857, he painted the portrait of Tsarina Maria Alexandrovna.\n\nDuring the Second Mexican Empire in the 1860s, headed by Maximilian I of Mexico, Winterhalter was commissioned to paint portraits of the Imperial couple. The Empress consort of Mexico, Charlotte of Belgium was the daughter of Louise-Marie of France, Queen of the Belgians, whom Winterhalter painted at the beginning of his career in France. Some of Winterhalter's paintings of the Mexican monarchs still remain in their Mexico City palace, Chapultepec Castle, now the National Museum of History.\n\nTo deal with those pressing for portrait commissions, many of whom were calling for multiple replicas, Winterhalter made extensive use of assistants. No portrait painter had ever enjoyed such an extraordinary royal patronage as Winterhalter; only Rubens and Van Dyck worked as he did in an international network.\n\nWinterhalter sought respite from the pressures of his work with holidays abroad in Italy, Switzerland, and above all Germany. Despite the many years he lived in France, he remained deeply attached to his native country. For all his success and popularity, Winterhalter continued to live simply and abstemiously. In 1859 he bought a villa in Baden-Baden, his favorite vacation spot.\n\nIn 1864 Winterhalter made his last visit to England. In the autumn of that year he traveled to Vienna to execute the portraits of Emperor Franz Joseph and Empress Elisabeth that remain among his most well-known works. As he grew older, Winterhalter's links with France weakened while his interest in Germany grew. He was taking a cure in Switzerland at the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, the war that ended the Second French Empire. After the war, the painter did not return to France, going instead to Baden. He was officially still accredited at the court of Baden and he settled in Karlsruhe. In the last two years of his life Winterhalter painted very little. During a visit to Frankfurt am Main in the summer of 1873 he contracted typhus and died on 8 July. He was 68 years old.\n\nWinterhalter came into his own as a portrait painter during the second Empire and he painted his best work during the last two decades of his life. He matched his style to the luxury and relaxed atmosphere of the age, its hedonism and gaiety. His female sitters of the 1850s and 1860s inhabit a different physiological climate from those he painted earlier; they are not reticent and reserved. His male sitters inspired few original or memorable compositions.\n\nWinterhalter never received high praise for his work from serious critics, being constantly accused of superficiality and affectation in pursuit of popularity. However, he was highly appreciated by his aristocratic patrons. The royal families of England, France, Spain, Russia, Portugal, Mexico, and Belgium all commissioned him to paint portraits. His monumental canvases established a substantial popular reputation, and lithographic copies of the portraits helped to spread his fame.\n\nWinterhalter's portraits were prized for their subtle intimacy; the nature of his appeal is not difficult to explain. He created the image his sitters wished or needed to project to their subjects. He was not only skilled at posing his sitters to create almost theatrical compositions, but also was a virtuoso in the art of conveying the texture of fabrics, furs and jewellery, to which he paid no less attention than to the face. He painted very rapidly and very fluently, designing most of his compositions directly in the canvas. His portraits are elegant, refined, lifelike, and pleasantly idealized.\n\nConcerning Winterhalter's method of working, it is thought that, practiced as he was at drawing and representing figures, he painted directly onto the canvas without making preliminary studies. He frequently decided upon the dress and pose of the sitter. His style was suave, cosmopolitan and plausible. Many of the portraits were copied in his workshop or reproduced as lithographs.\n\nAs an artist he remained a difficult figure to place; there are few painters with whom to compare him, and he does not fit into any school. His early affinities were Neoclassical but his style can be described as Neo-Rococo. After his death, his painting fell out of favor, being considered romantic, glossy, and superficial. Little was known about him personally and his art was not taken seriously until recently. However, a major exhibition of his work at the National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom) in London and the Petit Palais in Paris in 1987 brought him into the limelight again. His paintings are exhibited today in leading European and American museums.\n\n\n"}

As a result of World War II he moved to Venezuela in 1946, where he lived for the rest of his life. He was a successful businessman and part owner of ACO Group, a large Venezuelan conglomerate. He formed his own company Grupo Oriand in 1994. At the time of the restoration of Estonian independence, Männil got involved in Estonian matters, actively interacting with politicians Vaino Väljas and Edgar Savisaar, and acting as an advisor during latter's prime minister term.\n\nHarry Männil was an active art collector and philanthropist, especially noted for his collection of pre-Columbian art. His art related activities included serving as director of Caracas Athenaeum in Venezuela, and as advisor for the Museum of Modern Art in New York. He also founded Eduard Wiiralt Gallery in Estonian National Library.\n\nHarry Männil was born into an iron salesman's family on May 17, 1920, in Tallinn, Estonia, and spent his childhood in Pääsküla, Tallinn. He graduated from the Gustav Adolf Grammar School in 1938 and from 1939–40 studied economics at the University of Tartu and the Tallinn University of Technology. In the summer of 1941, during the Soviet occupation, he hid in a forest to avoid the mobilization. Männil joined the political police of the Estonian Self-Administration as an assistant in September 1941. He held the position until June 10, 1942, when he was fired for unknown reasons. This period of collaboration with the Nazi government would later lead to Männil being accused of war crimes. After being relieved, Männil continued his studies at the University of Tartu.\n\nIn October 1943 he escaped to Finland when the German Security Service began to consider him politically dangerous as a student leader at the university. In Finland he studied business management in Helsinki. Männil was accused by a local police official of illegal trade in gold and valuables brought to Finland by Estonian refugees. These claims were, however, denied by Männil.\n\nMännil moved to Sweden in September 1944 with the intention of continuing his studies. He stayed at a refugee camp for a short while. Soon he received a residence permit to live in Stockholm and a working permit that allowed him to take a job at an archive. In November 1944, a complaint regarding Männil's Nazi involvement was filed at the Swedish Commission of Foreigners, and he was investigated by the Sandler Commission. The relative ease with which Männil received his work and residence permits raised the suspicions of the local authorities. In September 1945, he was fired from his job at the request of the Commission of Foreigners. A month later, an extension to his residence permit was declined. Männil was allowed to stay in Stockholm to make preparations for his emigration to Venezuela, and an extension was granted on his residence permit a short while later. After Männil was denied a transit visa to Britain, the Swedish authorities pressured him to leave the country.\n\nWhen Männil arrived in Maracaibo, Venezuela, in February 1946, he described himself as \"penniless\". He had traveled there under an employment contract to work for the enterprise headed by Juan Mendiri in Maracaibo and which later became part of BECO. He joined BECO, a department store founded in 1942 and owned by Blohms, a family of German descent. Beco was bought out by a group of investors headed by Arnold Orav together with Juan Simon Mendoza (co-founder of Venezuela's largest business empire, the Polar Group), and a couple of other Estonians, who, like Männil, were members of the academic corporation Vironia. Arnold Carl Orav, Chmn, split from BECO in 1951 to form ACO Group, a company that would eventually control over one-sixth of Venezuela's automotive trade. Männil received Venezuelan citizenship in 1952. Männil assumed the title of Chmn, in addition to CEO of the ACO Group, It emerged in the 1970s as the world's largest tractor dealership as the dealer for John Deere Tractors in Venezuela. It also became the largest automobile dealership in South America, according to the Ford Motors Company (USA). A significant contributor to the success of the Aco Group was the innovative introduction in Venezuela of in-house auto sale financing using a captive finance company. In 1983, the Aco Group was ranked fifth largest private-sector company in Venezuela [El Universal]. A progressive downturn in Venezuela's economy which had particular adverse on Aco's capital intensive businesses, resulted in a reorganization in 1994 under new leadership. Mannil was voted out as CEO so he left ACO and formed Oriand, with a portion of auto dealerships that had been part of Aco. At that time he had been the fourth largest shareholder, owning 20% of the company. Männil continued to own Oriand Grupo Oriand, until his death.\n\nMännil was member of AEI World Forum, founded by president Gerald Ford whom Männil personally knew.\n\nIn 1990, Männil visited Estonia for the first time since 1943 at the invitation of Vaino Väljas, who he had met when Väljas was the Soviet ambassador to Venezuela. At the time of the restoration of Estonian independence (1990–1992), during the governments of Edgar Savisaar and Tiit Vähi, Männil was the president of the Prime Minister's Economy Friends Club. The club consisted of Estonian businessmen living abroad who gave economic advice and helped to explain Estonia's situation to Western nations. Männil was a godfather of Savisaar's daughter.\n\nNear the end of 2002, Männil was forced to temporarily relocate to Costa Rica due to the Venezuelan general strike. Männil's sons succeeded him when he retired from active business dealings in 2003. Harry Männil died on January 11, 2010, in San José, Costa Rica. His ashes were placed in a chapel on his ranch located in the mountains of Costa Rica.\n\nMännil was known as an art collector and cultural benefactor in several countries. His interest in art collecting first arose when he came into the possession of some works by Eduard Wiiralt during World War II. Männil started collecting pre-Columbian art in 1957, and eventually owned the largest private collection in Venezuela. His collection was regarded as among the 200 most important private collections by \"ARTnews\" magazine in 1997. Männil classified his art collection into three main groups: pre-Columbian art, modern Latin American art, and art of the South American Indigenous people. He also possessed a few items of 17th–18th century colonial art. Männil, together with his wife, promoted the commercial production and marketing of the textile works of the Guajiro Indians. These two interests led to conflicts with local anthropologists, who criticized their relationship with the Guajiro people and their means of building their archaeological collection.\n\nOn July 22, 2010, after Harry Männil's death, Costa Rican authorities raided his house in Heredia and seized 108 pieces of pre-Columbian art, including fourteen large stone spheres. The family had been given two deadlines to hand over the objects voluntarily, and since that did not happen, a raid was conducted. Officials stated that the pieces had been obtained through an illegal purchase which had broken a law against trafficking in archaeological artifacts. The objects were taken to the Museo Nacional de Costa Rica in San José.\n\nHarry Männil was the founder and first director of the West Venezuela Water Sport Federation, and had been the director of Caracas Athenaeum in Caracas and the Maracaibo Art Center. He was a member of the International Council of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Männil, together with Henry Radeval, contributed to the establishment of the Estonian National Library's Eduard Wiiralt gallery and founded the Eduard Wiiralt Art Award in 1998.\n\nEstonian writer Olev Remsu has published a biography of Harry Männil titled \"Elitaarne mees\" (Tänapäev 2011).\n\nFrom 1968 until his death Männil was a Knight of Malta. He was an honorary citizen of the city of Thibodaux, Louisiana. The Venezuelan government awarded him the Order of the Star of Carabobo and the Order of Francisco de Miranda. He received the Order of the Polar Star from the King of Sweden.\n\nHarry Männil was a brother of geologist Ralf Männil. He married Masula D'Empaire, a granddaughter of commercial tycoon and banker Samuel Belloso, in 1955; they had four children. The Belloso are a prominent family of recent Jewish heritage dating back as commercial traders and bankers in Curacao. Many of the family members converted to become Catholics while others retained their Jewish faith to the present.\n\nMännil's primary country of residence was Venezuela, where he lived in Caracas, but he also owned a ranch in Costa Rica, a farm in Llanos, Venezuela, and apartments in Paris and New York.\n\n"}

It is now in the National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh. Made within a few decades of 700 AD, the Hunterston Brooch is cast in silver, gilt, and set with pieces of amber (most now missing), and decorated with interlaced animal bodies in gold filigree. The diameter of the ring is 12.2 cm, and in its centre there is a cross and a golden Glory representing the Risen Christ, surrounded by tiny bird heads. The pin, which is broken, can travel freely around the ring as far as the terminals, which was necessary for fastening; it is now 13.1 cm long, but was probably originally 15 cm or more. \n\nThe brooch may have been made at a royal site, such as Dunadd in Argyll, though is more likely to have been made in Ireland, especially as its pseudo-penannular form is typical of Irish brooches, whereas the truly penannular form remained usual in Pictish brooches. On the other hand, its style is closely comparable to a terminal fragment of a penannular brooch found in Dunbeath in 1860 which probably was made in Scotland; craftsmen may have travelled across the area using the locally popular forms. Lloyd and Jennifer Laing feel it was probably made in Dalriada, and the Museum of Scotland say \"The style of the brooch has Irish parallels, while the filigree resembles metalwork from England. The brooch was probably made in western Scotland where the two traditions were joined, or perhaps in Ireland by a craftsman trained in foreign techniques.\"\n\nThe brooch has a complex construction typical of the most elaborate Irish brooches. Panels of filigree work were created separately on gold trays, which were then fitted into the main silver-gilt body. On the reverse four panels of silver-gilt were also inserted; as in other examples like the Tara Brooch the decoration on the reverse uses older curvilinear \"Celtic\" motifs looking back to La Tène style Insular Celtic decoration, though on the Hunterston Brooch such motifs also appear on the front. \n\nThe back of the brooch has a scratched inscription in runes in the Old Norse language, probably 10th century, \"Melbrigda owns this brooch\"; Maél Brigda, \"devotee of Bridgit\" is a common Gaelic female name, though seen as male by other sources. Much later ownership inscriptions are not uncommon on elaborate Celtic brooches, often from Norse-Gael contexts. The Hunterston Brooch is clearly an object of very high status, indicating the power and great prestige of its owner. With the Tara Brooch in Dublin, and the Londesborough Brooch in the British Museum, it is considered one of the finest of over 50 highly elaborate Irish Celtic brooches to survive, and is \"arguably the earliest of the ornate penannular brooches from Britain and Ireland\".\n\n"}

{"id": "47833350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47833350", "title": "Litema", "text": "Litema\n\nLitema (pronounced: /ditʼɪːma/; also spelled \"Ditema\"; Singular: Tema, Sesotho for \"text\" or \"ploughed land\") is a form of Sesotho mural art composed of decorative and symbolic geometric patterns, commonly associated with Sesotho tradition today practised in Lesotho and neighbouring areas of South Africa. Basotho women generate litema on the outer walls and inside of homesteads by means of engraving, painting, relief mouldings and/or mosaic. Typically the geometric patterns are combed or scratched into the wet top layer of fresh clay and dung plaster of the wall, and later painted with earth ochers or, in contemporary times, manufactured paint. Patterns most often mimic ploughed fields through a combed texture, or the patterns refer to plant life, and more occasionally to other aspects of the natural world, such as referring to clan totem animal. Litema are transient; they may desiccate and crumble or be washed away by heavy rain. It is common for women of an entire village to apply litema on such special occasions as a wedding or a religious ceremony.\n\nAs Gary van Wyk (1993:84) pointed out in his analysis of the etymology of the Sesotho noun denoting \"Sesotho mural art,\" \"litema\" also refers to the associated concepts of \"ploughed lands\", and the decorative tradition is symbolically linked to cultivation in many ways. It is derived from the verb stem \"-lema\" (in the infinitive, \"ho lema\" \"to cultivate\"), which is a reflex of the Proto-Bantu root \"*-dɪ̀m-\" \"to cultivate (esp. with hoe)\". The orthographic <l> in \"li-\" (Class 10 noun class prefix for Sesotho nouns) is pronounced [d] in Sesotho since [d] is an allophone of /l/ occurring before the close vowels, /i/ and /u/. The orthographic <e> can have three possible values in Sesotho: /ɪ/, /ɛ/, and /e/. In <litema> is pronounced /ɪ/, as per the Proto-Bantu root.\n\nThe litema patterns are characterised by a multi-stage symmetry. Patterns are generally arranged in square cells. A wall to be shaped is divided into a grid to form the cells. Each cell is applied with the same pattern, which is usually rotated or mirrored from cell to cell. The symmetry of the overall pattern thus depends on the symmetries present in the basic pattern. There are designs with only one mirror axis in the basic patterns that result in an overall impression of flowing in one direction. Other basic patterns have several axes of symmetry or a rotational symmetry, and give the overall pattern a rather flat ornamental impression. The colour design is restrained, usually only two colours are used\n\nThe tradition of mural art in Southern Africa is not of recent origins. While excavations at Sotho-Tswana archaeological sites have revealed hut floors that have survived the elements for as much as 1500 years, the earliest evidence of Sotho-Tswana mural painting stretches back about five centuries (Grant 1995:45 ; Van Wyk 1998:88). It long predates the tradition of Ndebele mural painting that has been globaly popularized. Begun in the 19th century, the Ndzundza Ndebele mural art tradition called \"igwalo\" (more widely known as Ndebele house painting), is said to be a synthesis of a Northern Sotho \"ditema\" tradition and the Nguni design traditions employed in beadwork, pottery and basket weaving.\n\nOne of the earliest written accounts of Basotho mural art is by the missionary Rev. John Campbell. In his 1813 description of Batlhaping (South Tswana) art, Campbell stated the following:\"Having heard of some paintings in Salakootoo's house, we went after breakfast to view them. We found them very rough representations of the camel-leopard, rhinoceros, elephant, lion, tiger, and stein-buck, which Salakootoo's wife had drawn on the clay wall, with white and black paint. However, they were as well done as we expected, and may lead to something better\" (Grant 1995:43).\n\nOn his second journey in 1820, Campbell, gave an enthusiastic account of what he saw at the house of a certain chief \"Sinosee\" of the Hurutse lineage of the Sotho-Tswana. Campbell provided both illustrations as well as a verbal description of the chief's house: \"The wall was painted yellow, and ornamented with figures of shields, elephants and camel-leopards, etc. It was also adorned with a neat cornice or border painting of a red colour...its walls (of Sinosee's bedroom) were decorated with delightful representations of elephants and giraffes… In some houses there were figures, pillars, etc moulded in hard clay and painted with different colours that would not have disgraced European workmen\" (Van Wyk 1996:43; 1998:88).\n\nCampbell's accounts were compiled and published by historian George Stow, in his book \"The Native Races of South Africa\" (1905). Stow also published the earliest known drawings of litema – reproductions of eight designs made by the \"Bakuena\" (the founding clan of the Basotho nation), which he likely drew himself, based on an unpublished letter by Stow in the South African Library in which he recounts visiting a ruined Bakoena kraal (Van Wyk 1998:89). Stow's drawings showed textured panels similar to litema engravings still made today as well as painted patterns of dots, stripes, triangles, and zigzags executed in limited colors. \n\nIn his 1861 book, the French missionary Eugene Casallis recalled the litema patterns he had experienced since settling among Basotho in the 1830s, calling the designs \"ingenious\", which suggests designs more intricate than the Bakoena examples Stow reproduced (Van Wyk 1998:89). Stow's documentation did not include any designs incorporating plant motifs like those seen in modern-day litema. Van Wyk (1994) suggests that the more modern and \"intricate curvilinear designs have a distinctly Victorian or Edwardian flavor that was probably influenced by such turn-of-the-century European products as linoleum patterns, cast-iron moldings and lace\". \n\nAlmost a century separates Stow's drawings from those done in 1976 by students of the Lesotho National Teachers Training College (Van Wyk 1989:89). Benedict Lira Mothibe, an art lecturer at the college at the time, instructed students to copy litema designs for the purposes of using these in classroom geometry lessons and as copies for potato prints. More importantly, it was an attempt by Mothibe to revive interest in what he considered a worthwhile Sesotho tradition. Gary van Wyk employed these drawings during his extensive field research in South Africa and Lesotho from 1991-1994, recording women's responses to the historical patterns, including the names and meanings they ascribed to them, and later republished several of the drawings. He found that although many of the specific vegetal patterns (e.g. \"melons\") that had been named in the 1970s had been forgotten by the 1990s and subsumed under a general descriptive category of \"blomme\", the Afrikaans word for \"flowers,\" nonetheless this designation maintained the close symbolic association between women and vegetative fertility, linked to women's traditional roles as cultivators and foragers. Furthermore, a few patterns recorded by Mothibe were still identifiable and being produced in the early 1990s, such as one that refers to the board for marabaraba, a popular indigenous game like checkers (1998:90-91). \n\nMore recently (2003), Mothibe, in a further contribution towards the cause of preservation, compiled and donated a second edition on litema designs entitled \"Basotho Litema Patterns (With Modifications)\" to the School of Design Technology and Visual Art of the Central University of Technology, Free State, providing an updated record of designs and their interpretation.\n\nResearch conducted by Van Wyk and Mathews in the late-1980s and mid-1990s, culminating in two photographically illustrated books titled \"African Painted Houses: Basotho Dwellings of Southern Africa\" (Van Wyk, 1998) and \"The African Mural\" (Chanquion & Matthews, 1989)), suggests that the art of litema cannot be understood in purely aesthetic terms. \n\nIn several works on this topic, Gary Van Wyk (1993, 1994, 1996, 1998) states that Sesotho murals are a form of religious art, appeals to the ancestors for the rain that delivers the fertility that nourishes the fields and thereby sustains the herds and the human community. Murals, he says, can be seen as prayers in paint. If the ancestors are satisfied, they provide rain that washes away the murals, and the cycle of life begins anew. It is fitting that murals are produced by women, who are symbolically linked to the house, which is a metaphor of the womb and of creation, and to the vegetal realm to which women are linked through their traditional roles as cultivators and foragers, and through several other vegetal symbols. The Basotho creation myth, for example, states that the nation emerged from a dark place deep in the earth through a bed of reeds; accordingly it was once customary upon the birth of child inside the earthen house, originally built in an igloo shape, and therefore womb-like, to place a reed in the doorway of the home until the child \"crossed the reed\" to emerge into the light of day (Van Wyk 1998: 103-107). Similarly, female initiates wear a reed mask, and during their initiation confinement they weave reed mats. \n\nThis symbolic link between the igloo-shaped house and the body later was transferred to modern rectangular homes with flat roofs, where the surrounds of doorways and windows were particularly ornamented, and the name for the litema patterns along the roofline was the \"headband\". \n\n\"The fecundity of fields and of women is celebrated in the creation of radiant blooms, unfurling fronds, spiralling tendrils and sprouts...Because agricultural labor was traditionally women's work, women who decorate houses can be viewed as picturing this work in the fields upon their walls. The murals are thus African landscapes, composed of the very landscape they represent\"(Van Wyk 1994). This is most apparent in litema patterns that consist solely of uncolored combing into mud: these closely mimic the appearance of a plowed field. \n\nVan Wyk found that red ocher, called \"letsoku\", or \"the blood of the earth\", symbolized fertility and the blood of both menstruation and sacrifice, underscoring the key link between the ancestors and fertility and accounting for the fact that red ocher is invariably incorporated into every painting scheme. White symbolized the calm, purity and enlightenment that the ancestors promote and desire, while black represented the dark rain clouds that the ancestors deliver if all is calm and well, and these two colors are frequently combined in dense, alternating patterns applied to transitional zones of the architecture, such as the roofline and around doors and windows. Similarly, such patterns elements as triangles and zigzags likely also carried symbolic meanings that have become obscured in recent times. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Van Wyk also photographed murals that expressed political statements, using the colors of the banned African National Congress during the apartheid era, or incorporating specific political graphics or statements. \nTom Mathews in his writings (supported by photographs taken by his son Paul Chanquion) stated that flowers and dots were symbols of fertility. Furthermore, he states that chevron patterns represent water or uneven ground whilst triangles are symbols denoting male and female (Changuion & Matthews, 1989:9,19,55).\n\nIn the study conducted by the CUT, no persons knowledgeable in the art of litema (Bekker, Thabane and Mothibe) or practising litema artists had any knowledge of a deeper significance other than that of beautifying the home for aesthetic purposes. Some of the artists questioned did however share their opinions concerning the possibility of symbolic meaning. According to artists in the Free State, their mothers (many of whom originate from Lesotho), might have been aware of such meanings, but did not share this information with them during their teaching.\n\nOne popular commentator has claimed that litema represent an ancient Basotho logographic writing system. As stated above, it is probable that there has always been a symbolic logic associated with litema (perhaps comparable to the tradition of Adinkra symbols in West Africa), but there is little evidence to assert the historical existence of a formal logography of the kind represented in Egyptian hieroglyphics or Chinese characters.\n\nNevertheless, there is indeed a contemporary writing system (specifically, a featural syllabary) associated with litema, that can be used to write Sesotho (and all other Southern Bantu languages). It is called \"Ditema tsa Dinoko\" (\"Ditema syllabary\") and is also known by its Zulu name, \"Isibheqe Sohlamvu\", and various other related names in different languages.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2069562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2069562", "title": "Quillwork", "text": "Quillwork\n\nQuillwork is a form of textile embellishment traditionally practiced by Native Americans that employs the quills of porcupines as an aesthetic element. Quills from bird feathers were also occasionally used in quillwork.\n\nPorcupine quillwork is an art form completely unique to North America. Before the introduction of glass beads, quillwork was a major decorative element used by the peoples who resided in the porcupine's natural habitat, which included indigenous peoples of the Subarctic, Northeastern Woodlands, and Northern Plains. The use of quills in designs spans from Maine to Alaska. Quillworking tools were discovered in Alberta, Canada and date back to the 6th century CE.\n\nCheyenne oral history, as told by Picking Bones Woman to George Bird Grinnell, says quilling came to their tribe from a man who married a woman, who hid her true identity as a buffalo. His son was also a buffalo. The man visited his wife and son in their buffalo home, and, while among the buffalo, the man learned the art of quilling, which he shared with the women of his tribe.\n\nJoining the Cheyenne Quilling Society was a prestigious honor for Cheyenne women. Upon entering the Society, women would work first on quilling moccasins, then cradleboards, rosettes for men's shirts and tipis, and ultimately, hide robes and backrests.\n\nPorcupine quills often adorned rawhide and tanned hides, but during the 19th century, quilled birch bark boxes were a popular trade item to sell to European-Americans among Eastern and Great Lakes tribes. Quillwork was used to create and decorate a variety of Native American items, including those of daily usage to Native American men and women. These include clothing such as coats and moccasins, accessories such as bags and belts, and furniture attachments such as a cradle cover.\n\nQuills suitable for embellishment are two to three inches long and may be dyed before use. In their natural state, the quills are pale yellow to white with black tips. The tips are usually snipped off before use. Quills readily take dye, which originally was derived from local plants and included a wide spectrum of colors, with black, yellow, and red being the most common. By the 19th century, aniline dyes were available through trade and made dying easier.\n\nThe quills can be flattened with specific bone tools or by being run through one's teeth. Awls were used to punch holes in hides, and sinew, later replaced by European thread, was used to bind the quills to the hides.\n\nThe four most common techniques for quillwork are appliqué, embroidery, wrapping, and loom weaving. Appliquéd quills are stitched into hide in a manner that covers the stitches. In wrapping, a single quill may be wrapped upon itself or two quills may be intertwined.\n\nQuills can be appliquéd singly to form curvilinear patterns, as found on Odawa pouches from the 18th century. This technique lends itself to floral designs popularized among northeastern tribes by Ursuline nuns. Huron women excelled at floral quillwork during the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nPlains quillwork is characterized by bands of rectangles creating geometrical patterns found also in Plains painting. Rosettes of concentric circles of quillwork commonly adorned historical Plains men's shirts, as did parallel panels of quillwork on the sleeves. These highly abstracted designs had layers of symbolic meaning.\n\nThe Red River Ojibwe of Manitoba created crisp, geometric patterns by weaving quills on a loom in the 19th century.\n\nQuillwork never died out as a living art form in the Northern Plains. Some communities that had lost their quillwork tradition have been able to revive the art form. For instance, no women quilled in the Dene community of Wha Ti, Northwest Territories by the late 1990s. The Dene Cultural Institute held two workshops there in 1999 and 2000, effectively reviving quillwork in Wha Ti.\n\nThe art form is very much alive today. Examples of contemporary, award-winning quillworkers include Juanita Growing Thunder Fogarty, (Sioux-Assiniboine) artist; Dorothy Brave Eagle (Oglala Lakota) of Denver, Colorado; Kanatiiosh (Akwesasne Mohawk) of St. Regis Mohawk Reservation; Sarah Hardisty (Dene) of Jean Marie River, Northwest Territories; Leonda Fast Buffalo Horse (Blackfeet) of Browning, Montana; and Deborah Magee Sherer (Blackfeet) of Cut Bank, Montana.\n\nNorthern Lakes College of Alberta, Canada teaches a college-level course in quillwork art.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8918515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8918515", "title": "Resist dyeing", "text": "Resist dyeing\n\nResist dyeing (resist-dyeing) is a traditional method of dyeing textiles with patterns. Methods are used to \"resist\" or prevent the dye from reaching all the cloth, thereby creating a pattern and ground. The most common forms use wax, some type of paste made from starch or mud, or a mechanical resist that manipulates the cloth such as tying or stitching. Another form of resist involves using a chemical agent in a specific type of dye that will repel another type of dye printed over the top. The best-known varieties today include tie-dye and batik.\n\nWax or paste: melted wax or some form of paste is applied to cloth before being dipped in dye. Wherever the wax has seeped through the fabric, the dye will not penetrate. Sometimes several colors are used, with a series of dyeing, drying and waxing steps. The wax may also be applied to another piece of cloth to make a stencil, which is then placed over the cloth, and dye applied to the assembly; this is known as resist printing.\n\nStencils: a stencil is placed over the fabric where it is to be shielded from ink, similar to how screen prints are made.\n\nMechanical: the cloth is tied, stitched, or clamped using clothespegs or wooden blocks to shield areas of the fabric.\n\nChemical: a modern textile printing method, commonly achieved using two different classes of fiber reactive dyes, one of which must be of the vinyl sulfone type. A chemical-resisting agent is combined with dye Type A, and printed using the screenprint method and allowed to dry. A second dye, Type B, is then printed overtop. The resist agent in Type A chemically prevents Type B from reacting with the fabric, resulting in a crisp pattern/ground relationship.\n\nResist dyeing has been very widely used in Eurasia and Africa since ancient times. The first discoveries of pieces of linen was from Egypt and date from the fourth century. Cloth, used for mummy wrappings, was coated with wax, scratched with a sharp stylus, and dyed with a mixture of blood and ashes. After dyeing the cloth was washed in hot water to remove the wax. In Asia, this technique was practiced in China during the T'ang dynasty (618–907), in India and Japan in the Nara period (645–794). In Africa it was originally practiced by the Yoruba tribe in Nigeria, Soninke and Wolof in Senegal.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Her parents were both Southerners, with her father, an accountant who worked in nearby New York City, New York, holding a Phi Beta Kappa key from Duke University, in North Carolina. Ernest's mother had been the president of the boarding school formerly known as St. Mary's College in that state. Cruikshank has a brother, and had a sister, Carol, who died in 1991. Their maternal aunt, Bea, was a painter from the 1910s to the 1940s, whose work included a portrait commission by US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Cruikshank studied art at Smith College, where in her junior year art teacher Elliot Offner sent slides of her colored-pencil and clay-relief-on-paper drawings to a screening committee that resulted in a scholarship to the two-month Yale Summer Art School. At the urging of a classmate there, Warner Wada, she began considering adapting her drawing style to animation. Returning to Smith for her senior year and obtaining the primer \"Animation\" by Preston Blair, Cruikshank, with additional research, arranged for a special-studies class in animation. With an animation stand consisting of a Bolex camera attached to a photo enlarger, constructed by instructor David Batchelder, she produced her first animated short, the three-minute, 16mm \"Ducky\". Done with watercolor and paper animation, it starred a prototype version of her future recurring character Quasi, which one writer characterized as \"an infantile duck with buck front teeth, thick glasses and a red cape\". Cruikshank, describing her anthropomorphic characters, said, \"My ducks are based on the ducks from Carl Barks' comics. But I guess they got twisted in memory, because people don't seem to see much similarity between them.\"\n\nEncouraged by the response of \"Ducky\", Cruikshank, after graduation, enrolled at the San Francisco Art Institute, in San Francisco, California, to study filmmaking. Under instructor Larry Jordan, she made the five-minute animated short \"Fun on Mars\" (1971), which used watercolor, crayon markers on paper, cutouts, and collage. Produced for $100, it also featured early versions of her trademark duck-creatures. Her next short, \"Chow Fun\" (1972), created with a $400 grant secured in association with PBS, mixed paper animation and cutouts glued onto animation cels.\n\nWhile editing \"Chow Fun\" at San Francisco's Snazelle Films, a commercial-film company that also rented out space and film equipment, Cruikshank, at an employee's suggestion, showed her work to company president E. E. Gregg Snazelle, who gave her a job a week later \"to experiment in animation and do TV commercials when there was work\". By the end of summer 1972, Cruikshank was head animator there. In 2009, she recalled of her time with Snazelle,\n\nAt Snazelle, Cruikshank began developing her best-known work, \"Quasi at the Quackadero\" (1975), working titles of which included \"I Walked with a Duck\", \"Hold That Quasi\", and \"Quasi Quacks Up\". The 10-minute, 35mm short, with 100 watercolor backgrounds and approximately 5,000 cels, took two years for Cruikshank to draw, followed by four months for photography and post-production. Cruikshank independently financed the $6,000 budget, which went primarily for cel painting, sound recording and lab and camera work. Underground cartoonist Kim Deitch, then Cruikshank's boyfriend, did much of the inking, using dip pen and rapidograph, with Kathryn Lenihan doing most of the cel painting. The short starred Quasi, voiced by Deitch; Anita, which one writer described as \"Betty Boop with a New Wave wardrobe\" and whose Mae West-like voice was supplied by Cruikshank; and robot Rollo. They progress through the Quackadero, a Coney Island-esque sideshow with such attractions as the Hall of Time Mirrors, which depict the viewer as he or she will look in \"old age\" or \"100 years from now\", and the Time Holes, in which one can lean on a railing and see a live slice of three million years B.C. unfold. The music, by the Berkeley, California band the Cheap Suit Serenaders, used slide flute, xylophone, ukulele, duck call, boat whistle and bagpipe to create what Cruikshank called the \"strange, gallopy feeling\" of 1920s/1930s dance-band music, of which she is a devotee.\n\n\"Quasi at the Quackadero\" won awards and was shown at the Los Angeles Film Exposition, and made its first theatrical booking at the Northside Theater in Berkeley, not far from Cruikshank's home at the time at 1890 Arch Street in that city.\n\nCruikshank's next short, the eight-minute, 35mm \"Make Me Psychic\" (1978; working title \"Mesmeroid Madness\") returns Quasi and Anita and adds the suave Snozzy. Built around a device that taps into one's latent telekinetic power, leading to slapstick at a party, the $14,000 film also was financed by Cruikshank, with the higher budget going toward the hiring of additional cel painters and increased lab fees. Of its slicker look than her previous short, Cruikshank said, \"People didn't know what to make of 'Quasi.' It was pretty hard to absorb in one sitting, solid. So, I thought I would try directing the eye more, by simplifying things and giving the next film a clearer focus.\" The Cheap Suit Serenaders again supplied music.\n\nIn 1980, Cruikshank won a $10,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to create a storyboard and three-minute sample reel for a proposed animated feature, \"Quasi's Cabaret\", which she described as involving \"three hedonistic ducks who try to open the ultimate tropical nightclub.\" She also tried developing feature projects combining live action and animation, one a comedy set in a mental institution, the other, \"Joystick\", \"sort of a humorous horror story\" about the effects of computer animation on an artist modeled on herself. Additionally, she attempted to sell cable-TV networks on \"Weird Airways\", a projected series of three-minute shorts starring Snozzy as the owner-pilot of a charter airline and Anita as a flight attendant.\n\nCruikshank evolved a recognizable style with surrealistic and psychedelic elements. Her film \"Face Like a Frog\" (1987) bears a musical score by Oingo Boingo, with the group's Danny Elfman singing his song \"Don't Go in the Basement.\"\n\nCruikshank has contributed animation sequences to feature films, including \"\" (1983) and \"Top Secret!\" (1984), as well as the opening title sequences to \"Ruthless People\" (1986), \"Mannequin\" (1987), \"Loverboy\" (1989), \"Madhouse\" (1990), and \"Smiley Face\" (2007). She has also worked in commercials and website design. Cruikshank also animated and produced many music videos for \"Sesame Street\" from 1989-1999. \n\nFor a short time in the 1990s, Cruikshank was employed by the Palo Alto laboratory and technology incubator Interval Research Corporation as an animator.\n\nCruikshank is in the process, as of 2011, of transferring her works into 35mm film format, for archival purposes, In October 2012, several 35mm prints of her work were screened at the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nCruikshank was in a decade-long common-law marriage with underground cartoonist Kim Deitch during the period 1971–c. 1982. On March 17, 1984, she married producer Jon Davison, with whom she has a daughter, Dinah.\n\nCruikshank prefers the early New York City animation of such producers as the Fleischer Studios and the Van Beuren Studios, as well as early Bob Clampett. In a 1981 interview, she said of her own style at the time, \n\nSeveral other short films are on Cruikshank's YouTube channel.\n\nIn 1986, Cruikshank won the initial Maya Deren Award for independent film and video artists, given by the American Film Institute, along with Stan Brakhage and Nam June Paik.\n\nIn 2009, \"Quasi at the Quackadero\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress. It was voted in the 1994 book \"The 50 Greatest Cartoons: As Selected by 1,000 Animation Professionals\".\n\n"}

University cities, such as Gothenburg, Lund, Uppsala, and Linköping have long-running traditions of spex. The word is likely derived from abbreviated student slang for \"spektakel\" (spectacle; scene; show). This form of comedy theatre may also be known as Gyckel (buffoonery), when performed at a Gask.\n\nThe first spexes were performed possibly as early as the 16th century in Uppsala. Local students were practising Latin by writing short plays in Latin, called spexes. These performances were performed by male-only casts, as all the students at that time were male, and the tradition of gender switching for roles continues today. Over the next 300 years the spexes developed into their modern form, which emerged around 1850 at Uppsala University.\n\nThe first spexes in Finland were performed at the Helsinki University of Technology at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nSpexes are always amateur productions, written and performed by students, and often have a historical theme. \nOther prominent features of spexes are the musical-like mix of song (mostly popular hits with new parodic lyrics) and dialogue (often featuring rhyme), and heavy use of satire and parody.\n\nOne of the distinguishing features of spex as opposed to other forms of theatre is the central prominence of audience participation. The audience have established lines, shouting \"Restart!\" (Swedish: Omstart!/Omtag!) or \"One more time!\" (Swedish: En gång till!) if they consider the current scene to be of particularly high quality. The actor is then expected to improvise the scene or punchline in a new way. There are also several other commands that the audience can give, such as demanding that the actors should perform the current scene backwards, in slow-motion, or in another language.\n\nWhile spexes are typically in Swedish or Finnish, at least all Physicist Spex (Fyysikkospeksi, Aalto University, Finland) productions to date have been translated into English for a visiting performance in Stockholm, Sweden. The English translation is now also performed in Finland, to provide the unusual event of a spex aimed specifically at an audience of English-speaking students.\n\nWhen performed at a Gask, this form of theatre may be known as \"Gyckel\" or \"jyckel\". A gyckel typically involves a group of students singing a song or performing a play lasting no more than a few minutes. There are several unwritten rules, such as that the gyckel must have been written by the performers and be presented for the first time at the gask. The gyckel should also feature sarcastic and/or sexist humor.\n\nAt a gask with guests from different faculties it is usually expected that each faculty performs its own gyckel. Others may also report that they will be performing a gyckel to the toastmaster, who will then announce when the time has come for a certain group to perform their gyckel.\n"}

He was captured and executed in 1942 in Valjevo. The photo of him taken shortly before the execution has become a symbol of resistance against fascism in the Second World War. He was proclaimed People's Hero of Yugoslavia in 1949.\n\nStjepan Filipović was born on 27 January 1916 in Opuzen (modern-day Croatia) as fifth child in the family of Anton and Ivka Filipović. The Filipović family moved throughout the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, so he lived in Županja, Mostar and Kragujevac. In Kragujevac, he studied locksmithing and mastered the basics of electrical wiring, carpentry and bookbinding. He joined the labour movement in 1937, but he was arrested in 1939 and sentenced to a year in prison. He joined the Communist Party of Yugoslavia in 1940.\n\nFilipović was commander of the Partisans' Tamnavsko-Kolubarski unit in Valjevo (modern-day Serbia) by 1941. He was captured on 24 February 1942 by Axis forces and hanged in Valjevo on 27 May 1942, aged 26. As the rope was put around his neck, Filipović defiantly thrust his hands out and shouted \"Smrt fašizmu, sloboda narodu!\" which translates as \"Death to fascism, freedom to the people!\". He urged the Yugoslav people to resist and implored them to never cease resisting. At this moment, a photograph was taken which has since become famous, and from which a statue of Filipović was cast.\n\nFilipović was declared a National Hero of Yugoslavia on 14 December 1949. The town of Valjevo has a statue dedicated to him, \"\"Stevan\" Filipović\". A monument was also erected in his home town of Opuzen in 1968, but was demolished in 1991; reconstruction is planned by the Croatian Ministry of Culture.

It consists of a battered (sloping) face at the base of a fortified wall. The slope acts as an effective defensive measure in two ways. First, conventional siege equipment is less effective against a wall with a talus. Scaling ladders may be unable to reach the top of the walls and are also more easily broken due to the bending stresses caused by the angle they are forced to adopt. Siege towers cannot approach closer than the base of the talus, and their gangplank may be unable to cover the horizontal span of the talus, rendering them useless. Furthermore, defenders are able to drop rocks over the walls, which will shatter on the talus, spraying a hail of shrapnel into any attackers massed at the base of the wall.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3179882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3179882", "title": "Tertiary color", "text": "Tertiary color\n\nA tertiary color is a color made by mixing full saturation of one primary color with half saturation of another primary color and none of a third primary color, in a given color space such as RGB, CMYK (more modern) or RYB (traditional).\n\nTertiary colors have general names, one set of names for the RGB color wheel and a different set for the RYB color wheel. These names are shown below.\n\nAnother definition of tertiary color is provided by color theorists such as Moses Harrisand Josef Albers, who suggest that tertiary colors are created by intermixing pairs of secondary colors: orange-green, green-purple, purple-orange; or by intermixing complementary colors. This approach to tertiary color relates specifically to color in the form of paints, pigments and dyes. \n\nThe primary colors in an RGB color wheel are red, green, and blue, because these are the three additive colors—the primary colors of light. The secondary colors in an RGB color wheel are cyan, magenta, and yellow because these are the three subtractive colors—the primary colors of pigment.\n\nThe tertiary color names used in the descriptions of RGB (or equivalently CMYK) systems are shown below.\n\nThe primary colors in an RYB color wheel are red, yellow, and blue. The secondary colors — orange, green, and purple — are made by combining the primary colors.\n\nIn the red–yellow–blue system as used in traditional painting and interior design, tertiary colors are typically named by combining the names of the adjacent primary and secondary.\n\nThe terms for the RYB tertiary colors are not set. For the six RYB hues intermediate between the RYB primary and secondary colors, the names amber/marigold (yellow–orange), vermilion/cinnabar (red–orange), magenta (red–purple), violet/indigo (blue–purple), teal/aqua (blue-green), and chartreuse/lime green (yellow–green) are commonly found. The names for the twelve quaternary colors are more variable, if they exist at all, though indigo and scarlet are standard for blue–violet and red–vermilion.\n\nIn another sense, a tertiary color is obtained by mixing secondary-colored pigments. These three colors are russet (orange–purple), slate (purple–green), and citron (green–orange), with the corresponding three quaternary colors plum (russet–slate), sage (slate–citron), buff (citron–russet) (with olive sometimes used for either slate or citron). Beyond that are shades of grey (blue grey and brown greys), which approach but never quite reach black.\n\nThe RYB color terminology outlined above and in the color samples shown below is ultimately derived from the 1835 book \"Chromatography\", an analysis of the RYB color wheel by George Field, a chemist who specialized in pigments and dyes.\n\nUnlike the RGB (CMY) color wheel, the RYB color wheel has no scientific basis. The RYB color wheel was invented centuries before the 1890s, when it was found by experiment that magenta, yellow, and cyan are the primary colors of pigment, not red, yellow, and blue.\n\nThe RGB (CMY) color wheel has largely replaced the traditional RYB color wheel because it is possible to display much brighter and more saturated colors using the primary and secondary colors of the RGB (CMY) color wheel. In the terminology of color theory, RGB color space (CMY color space) has a much larger color gamut than RYB color space.\n\n"}

(aka The Lambs Club) is a social club in New York City for actors, songwriters, and others involved in the theatre. It is America's oldest theatrical organization. \"The Lambs\" is a registered trademark of The Lambs, Inc.; and the club has been commonly referred to as The Lambs Club and The Lambs Theater since 1874.\n\nIn 1868 The Lambs was founded in London by actors, led by John Hare, the first Shepherd, looking to socialize with like-minded people. Several of those, most notably Henry James Montague, came to the United States and formed The Lambs of New York during Christmas week of 1874. It was incorporated in 1877 in New York City. Shortly afterward the London Lambs closed.\n\nThe club's name honors the essayist Charles Lamb and his sister Mary, who during the early 19th century played host to actors and literati at their famed salon in London.\n\nIn 1924 they celebrated their golden jubilee at the Earl Carroll Theatre.\n\nThe Lambs, the New York Friars' Club and The Players in New York are often confused. In 1964 long-time syndicated columnist Earl Wilson put it this way: \"Long ago a New Yorker asked the difference between the Lambs, Friars, and Players, since the membership was, at the time, predominantly from Broadway.\" It was left to \"a wit believed to have been George S. Kaufman\" to draw the distinction: \"The Players are gentlemen trying to be actors, the Lambs are actors trying to be gentlemen, and the Friars are neither trying to be both.\"\n\nThe president of The Lambs is called \"The Shepherd\". The Club displays the portraits of all its presidents, painted by artists such as James Montgomery Flagg and Everett Raymond Kinstler.\n\nThe Lambs has had many Manhattan homes since 1874, beginning with Delmonico's Restaurant in Union Square. Then in 1875 they met at the Maison Doree on the south side of 14th St. opposite Union Square; 1876–77 next to Wallack's theater at 848 Broadway; 1877–78 at the Union Square Hotel, 6 Union Square; 1879 within a brownstone at 19 East 16th St.; 1880–91 at a Brownstone at 34 West 26th St.; 1891 at the Gilsey House, 1200 Broadway; 1892 at 8 West 29th St.; 1893–96 at 26 West 31st St.; 1897–1905 at 70 West 36th St., what was formerly and thereafter Keen's Chophouse remodeled by Stanford White to be a clubhouse; in 1905 at 128–130 West 44th St., in a house designed by Stanford White, then doubled in size in 1915.\n\nUntil 1974 the Club remained at the building at 128 West 44th St. The building was also designed by Stanford White, and was erected in 1904–1905; it expanded in 1915 to include 132 West 44th St. When the club relocated to its current nine-story quarters at 3 West 51st St. adjacent to Rockefeller Center, it sold its own quarters to the Church of the Nazarene which intended to use the old building as a mission in Times Square. The church leased part of the building for what would become the Off Broadway Lamb's Theatre which is not related to the Club except for the name of the building.\n\nThe building was designated a New York City Landmark in September 1974; and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 3, 1982.\n\nIn 2006 the Church of the Nazarene sold the building and theatre, which has been renovated by the Chatwal Hotel. They operate a restaurant in the hotel and named it The Lambs Club, although there is no relation between the hotel and The Lambs other than what was left of the building.\n\nThe Lambs, Inc., is still active in its nine-story quarters at 3 West 51st St. adjacent to Rockefeller Center. Its members have been instrumental in the formation of ASCAP, Actors' Equity and The Actors' Fund of America, Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and in the merger that created SAG-AFTRA. Of the first 21 Council members of Actors' Equity, 20 were members of The Lambs. The meetings to form Actors' Equity were held at The Players, a club similar to The Lambs, because there were too many producer members of The Lambs. The Actors' strike of 1919 was settled in The Lambs, which was referred to as \"Local One.\"\n\nHistorically, The Lambs has been the spawning ground of plays, friendships and partnerships. \"Mark Twain Tonight\" (with Hal Holbrook) and \"Stalag 17\" were first performed at The Lambs prior to their national successes.\n\nAlan J. Lerner and Frederick Loewe first met at The Lambs, often trying works-in-progress on their fellow Lambs. Loewe left a percentage of his share of Brigadoon royalties to The Lambs' Foundation. Since its founding, there have been more than 6,000 Lambs including Spencer Tracy, Fred Astaire, Irving Berlin, George M. Cohan, W.C. Fields, Will Rogers, John Philip Sousa, Conrad Nagel, Fred Waring and Albert Hague, and Cliff Robertson, Abe Vigoda and Ken Howard. Current members include Joyce Randolph of \"The Honeymooners,\" Jim Dale, Matthew Broderick and Tony Award-winning conductor/arranger Donald Pippin.

The song was adapted from the Cameroonian band Golden Sounds's 1986 song \"Zangaléwa.\" The song initially generated controversy after numerous South Africans expressed disappointment in FIFA's decision to select Shakira to sing the song, arguing that a native artist should have been assigned the role.\n\nIt garnered generally favourable reviews from critics, receiving praise for its production. \"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)\" peaked at number one on record charts of numerous countries including Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Switzerland. In the United States, the song peaked at number 38 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart and was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for selling over one million units in the country. The single similarly attained multi-platinum certifications in other countries, including a nine-times platinum certification in Sweden and a six-times platinum certification in Spain. \"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)\" has sold 15 million downloads worldwide, becoming one of the best-selling singles of all time.\n\nThe music video for \"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)\" was directed by Marcus Raboy and shows Shakira and a group of dancers and children dancing to the song together. It features cameos by various footballers like Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. It became popular on YouTube, receiving 2.1 billion views as of November 2018 and becoming the twenty-fifth most-watched video of all time on the site. Shakira performed the song at the 2010 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony on 10 June as well as at the closing ceremony on 11 July. It was also included on the set list of her The Sun Comes Out World Tour (2010–11) and El Dorado World Tour (2018).\n\nIn February 2010, Shakira wrote and produced \"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)\" with American record producer John Hill, who had previously collaborated with her on several songs from \"She Wolf\". The inclusion of Freshlyground, a South African Afro-fusion band, on the track came to take place after Hill met with their producer in New York. The band were finishing their studio album \"Radio Africa\" when Hill approached them requesting for input regarding the song. The producer left the band alone to make additions to the track and returned hours later to listen to it. Giving little reaction after hearing it, Hill expressed interest in recording \"everything I'd heard here\" and told the band that they would hear from him later.\nOn 26 April, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) announced that \"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)\" would serve as the official song of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, which was to begin in South Africa later in June, and would also appear on \"Listen Up! The Official 2010 FIFA World Cup Album.\" The announcement mentioned that Shakira would perform the song at the closing ceremony of the cup, which would take place before the Final match, on 11 July at the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg. She would also headline the World Cup FIFA World Cup Kick-Off Celebration Concert on 10 June at the Orlando Stadium in Johannesburg. The song was premiered on 28 April and was made available for digital download on the iTunes Store on 7 May 2010. It received a physical release as a CD single on 28 May. A Spanish-language version of the song, titled \"Waka Waka (Esto es África),\" was also recorded by Shakira. It was released as a single in specific markets. \"K-Mix\" versions of \"Waka Waka (This Time for África)\" and \"Waka Waka (Esto es Africa)\" were also included in the singer's ninth studio album, \"Sale el Sol,\" which she released in October the same year.\n\nA pop song, \"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)\" draws inspiration from traditional African music and blends an African Colombian rhythm with a Soca-influenced beat. It contains instrumentation from a Southern African guitar. The chorus of the song and the words \"waka waka\" are borrowed from \"Zangaléwa,\" a 1986 song recorded by Cameroonian band Golden Sounds, which was a hit not only across Africa but also in Shakira's native country, Colombia. According to Debora Halbert, author of the book \"The State of Copyright: The Complex Relationships of Cultural Creation in a Globalized World,\" Golden Sounds are not the original creators of the chorus too, since it has been adapted from \"military marches of unknown origins that go back as far as World War II.\"\nThe lyrics of \"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)\" compare football (soccer) players to soldiers on a battlefield and encourage them to fight for their goals. Fraser McAlpine from BBC Music Chart Blog described them to be \"about an undisclosed event which is about to happen for Africa, in which everyone gets together and enjoys the fruits of their hard work, even though there have been many hardships along the way.\" The Spanish version of the song does not contain a war metaphor and instead \"talks about walls coming down.\"\n\nFIFA's decision to choose \"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)\" as the official song was negatively received by South African people, who felt Shakira was not the \"right person to represent the country's first World Cup,\" arguing that an African artist should have been assigned the role. South African musicians were also displeased regarding the lack of native acts scheduled to perform at the FIFA World Cup Kick-Off Celebration Concert on 10 June 2010. They expressed anger towards the South African Football Association (SAFA) for letting international artists like Alicia Keys, the Black Eyed Peas, and Shakira to headline the event. Subsequently, the Creative Workers Union of South Africa planned a demonstration to be held on 15 April, but called it off after SAFA announced that the repertoire of performing acts would be finalised after \"consultation with fans and host cities.\" Danny Jordaan, head of the South African World Cup Organising Committee and president of SAFA, released a statement assuring that \"the incredibly talented South African and African music industry will play a major part in the tournament's off-field success and character.\" Freshlyground's violinist Kyla-Rose Smith defended FIFA's decision to select \"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)\" as the official song, saying: \"I think that the World Cup is a global event but it’s also a business, a huge marketing exercise. FIFA requires a musician of a certain global reach to appeal to all the different kinds of people who are involved and witness and watch the World Cup. So I understand the choice of someone like Shakira.\"\nThe \"waka waka\" riff of the song also generated controversy. In June 2010, it was reported that Dominican musician Wilfrido Vargas had decided to file a lawsuit against Shakira for plagiarising the riff off his composition \"El Negro No Puede\" for a sum of $11 million, which was performed by Dominican group Las Chicas del Can. However, Vargas later directly addressed the issue and said he did not have any intention to sue Shakira, clarifying that he himself did not own the riff used in \"El Negro No Puede,\" and that the prior statements made in his name were fabricated.\n\nFraser McAlpine from BBC Music Chart Blog gave the song a four out of five rating and praised its welding of \"undulating African guitars to a clod-hopping, skippy township beat.\" However, he felt the song did not seem to be about the World Cup and could \"just as easily be about a global effort to build water-pipes in the worst drought-ridden areas of the continental land-mass.\" Robert Copsey from Digital Spy rated it three out of five stars, favouring its \"ludicrously catchy\" chorus, although he commented: \"Somewhat inevitably, 'Waka Waka (This Time For Africa)' sees Shak[ira] replace her usual kooky lyrics with lines that wouldn't sound out of place on an \"X Factor\" winner's song.\" Kyle Anderson from MTV picked \"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)\" as the best official World Cup song, calling it a \"funky, inspirational tune.\" Canada.com critic Stuart Derdeyn, however, was highly critical of the song and called it \"sonic vomit\" and \"perhaps the stupidest official song for any major sporting event ever.\"\n\"Waka-Waka (This Time for Africa)\" received a nomination at the 2010 Premios \"Shock\" for \"Best Radio Song\" (\"Mejor Canción Radio\"), but lost to \"No Digas lo Siento\" by Don Tetto. The song was nominated \"Top Latin Song\" at the 2011 \"Billboard\" Music Awards. In the same year, it received a nomination for \"Latin Digital Download of the Year\" at the 2011 Latin \"Billboard\" Music Awards.
