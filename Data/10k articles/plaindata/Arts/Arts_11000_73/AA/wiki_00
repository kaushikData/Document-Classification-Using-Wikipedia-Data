The company agrees to provide financial and other support for the artist, including direct advances as well as support in marketing, promotion, touring and other areas. In turn, the artist agrees to give the company a percentage of an increased number of their revenue streams, often including sales of recorded music, live performances, publishing and more. \n\nThis business arrangement is an alternative to the traditional recording contract. In a 360 deal, a company typically provides support to an artist in more areas than covered by a traditional recording contract on the condition of receiving a percentage of revenue from these additional areas. During the first decade of the 21st century, revenues from recorded music fell dramatically and the profit margins traditionally associated with the record industry disappeared. The 360 deal reflects the fact that much of a musician's income now comes from sources other than recorded music, such as live performance and merchandise.\n\nAccording to Jeff Hanson, head of Silent Majority Group, the first new artist 360° deal was created by Hanson along with attorneys Jim Zumwalt and Kent Marcus, and Jim's partner Orville. It was submitted to Atlantic Records for the rock band Paramore while Hanson, Marcus and Zumwalt were employed by the label. Hanson has said there was strong resistance to the deal by both label and band and that he had to fight to make it happen, but believes his efforts were vindicated by the band's subsequent success, saying: \"How else would a label have been patient enough to put the band on three straight Warped Tours and down-streamed the band to Fueled by Ramen all while losing millions of dollars?\"\n\n360 deals have been made by traditional record companies, as in Robbie Williams's pioneering deal with EMI in 2002.\nThey have also been made between artists and promoters, as with Live Nation's 2007 deal with Madonna\nand 2008 deal with Jay-Z.\n\n360° deals have attracted criticism from various quarters. Panos Panay, CEO of online music platform Sonicbids, has said:\n\n\"If you want to find out the future of 360° deals, look at Motown in the late 60s. Motown was the pioneer of a 360° deal ... They owned your likeness, your touring, publishing, record royalties, told you what to wear, told you how to walk … It made for great entertainment but if you look at every one of those artists, what happened? Sooner or later they said, 'I’m not going to go on the road for 200 shows because you tell me so. I’m an artist! I’m a creative person!' Eventually all these artists left ... There’s two things we know about creativity: you can’t force it and you can’t really control it.\"\n"}

Renaissance art biographer Giorgio Vasari saw them in side altars of the church of San Giovanni Battista alla Calza, after the original location had been destroyed during the Siege of Florence in 1529. It was moved to the Uffizi in the 20th century.\n\nThe dating of the work is disputed: it varies from 1482, the year of Perugino's return from Rome, to a slightly later period, although before the end of the century, when the artist started to use only line oil, which in these works is used only at an experimental level.\n\nThe painting was restored in 1998.\n\nChrist is portrayed in center of the panel above a clear sky, kneeling in the Garden of Gethsemane and receiving by an angel a divine chalice. His figure forms a triangle with the three sleeping apostles at the bottom (from the left, John, Peter and James); the triangle is connected to the painting's sides by the symmetrical line of the hills. Behind Jesus is a lake landscape, a typical element of the Italian painting at the time, with a fortified city and an ancient bridge. \n\nAt the sides, two groups of soldiers, led by Judas Iscariot, are closing to arrest Jesus.\n"}
{"id": "14910198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14910198", "title": "An Leabhar Breac", "text": "An Leabhar Breac\n\nAn Leabhar Breac (\"Speckled Book\"), now less commonly Leabhar Mór Dúna Doighre (The Great Book of Dun Doighre\") or possibly erroneously, Leabhar Breac Mic Aodhagáin (\"The Speckled Book of the MacEgans\"), is a medieval Irish vellum manuscript containing Middle Irish and Hiberno-Latin writings. The manuscript is held in the library of the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin, where it is catalogued as RIA MS 23 P 16 or 1230.\n\nIt was most probably compiled by Murchadh (Riabach) Ó Cuindlis of Bally Lough Deacker, at Duniry between the years 1408 and 1411. Duniry — Dún Daighre, Dún Doighre — in eastern Clanricarde (now east County Galway) is situated south-east of the town of Loughrea, and in the medieval era was home to a branch of the bardic Clann Mac Aodhagáin (the MacEgans), who served as brehons for the O'Connors of Clanricarde.\n\nIn the 16th century, the manuscript was in the possession of the Mac Egans of Duniry, hence the older title Leabhar Mór Dúna Doighre. In 1629, when the manuscript was held in the convent of Kinalehin, County Galway.\n\nIt was consulted by Mícheál Ó Cléirigh, brother of the Four Masters, who copied pp. 272–7. The book passed into the possession of Eamon Ó Ceallaigh (Co. Roscommon) in 1732, then of Dr. John O'Brien by 1768 and finally of Cornelius O'Daly (Mitchelstown, Co. Cork). The Royal Irish Academy acquired the first volume in 1789, when General Charles Vallancey purchased it for the academy for 3 guineas from Cornelius O'Daly. O'Daly also owned the second volume, which comprises nine leaves, but was unaware that it belonged to the larger volume. In 1789, this volume was acquired by Chevalier O'Gorman, by George Smith of College Green in the next century and by the Academy sometime after 1844. The manuscript is held in the Academy's library in Dublin to this day.\n\nThe manuscript is of a large size, measuring 40.5 cm x 28 cm, which makes it the largest Irish vellum manuscript to have been written by a single scribe. It contains 40 folios, which are written in double columns. Capitals are decorated in a simple style, with some letters having been interwoven with zoomorphic patterns and coloured in red, vermilion, yellow and blue. There are two drawings, a flower-like diagram on p. 121 and a drawing of the Crucifixion on p. 166.\n\nThe manuscript consists almost entirely of religious writings in Latin and Middle Irish. It includes homiletic \"Lives\" of Saint Patrick, Saint Columba, Saint Brigid, Saint Cellach, and Saint Martin, the earliest version of \"Félire Óengusso\" (\"Martyrology of Óengus\"), the \"Rule of the Céli Dé\", \"Aislinge Meic Con Glinne\" (\"The Vision of Mac Conglinne\"), a version of \"Fís Adamnáin\" (\"The Vision of Adamnán\"), \"Saltair na Rann\", \"Stair Nicomeid\" (\"Gospel of Nicodemus\"), \"Amra Choluim Chille\", a Marian litany, and various ecclesiastical legends, hymns, catecheses and homilies. Exceptions to the predominantly religious contents are \"Sanas Cormaic\" (\"Cormac's Glossary\") and a history of Philip of Macedon and Alexander the Great.\n\nThe numerous notes which Murchadh Ó Cuindlis jotted into the margins afford us a unique glimpse of the circumstances of the writing process. These range from everyday details like a cat straying about or a robin singing in a beautiful voice to a nearby pillage in Lorrha by a certain Murchad Ua Madagáin. A persistent object of complaint for the writer is the weather, in particular the cold. Based on the notes, Tomás Ó Concheanainn has been able to reconstruct the time span in which certain sections had been written. For instance, it took the scribe about 6 weeks to write 35 pages (pp. 141–75), while some parts proved more challenging, such as a column for a poem with interlinear glosses, which cost him a day.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 6, 2002. This episode, as well as the earlier \"Anthology of Interest I\", serves to showcase three \"imaginary\" stories.\nProfessor Farnsworth hauls out his What-If Machine again, fine-tunes it, and the crew takes a look at three alternative realities.\nBender asks what would happen if he were human. The simulation opens with Professor Farnsworth announcing that he has invented a process of reverse fossilization, which can turn robots and machines into organic life-forms. He uses his process on Bender, who is transformed into a human. After a short period of adaptation, Bender's self-control is overwhelmed by his new senses of taste and touch, and goes on a binge of eating, smoking, partying, and drinking alcohol. \nA week later, at the Nobel Prize judging, the Professor presents Bender, who has become an overweight blob. The committee initially condemns Farnsworth, but Bender begs them to consider his lifestyle. This inspires the scientists to spend the night in a state of wild hedonism. The next morning, the hungover committee awards Bender the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, but discover that he died the moment the party began. The \"woo!\" noises that the partygoers assumed were from Bender were actually caused by air escaping the many folds of fat on his body. The Planet Express crew sadly roll away Bender's corpse.\nFry asks to see a world that is more like a video game. As the simulation starts, President of Earth Richard Nixon is preparing to sign a treaty with Ambassador Kong of planet Nintenduu 64. Ambassador Kong attacks Nixon, and a state of war erupts.\nDue to his extensive knowledge of video games from the 20th Century, Fry is brought to the Milatari headquarters and introduced to General Colin Pac-Man. Before Fry can impart his wisdom to the military, the Nintendians launch an attack on Washington, D.C., and they are forced into the escape tunnels, which resemble a Pac-Man board.\nThey emerge outside the Planet Express building, where the Nintendian invaders, led by Lrrr, are blasting New New York. Fry situates himself at the controls of a rolling anti-aircraft artillery platform, and begins destroying the alien ships in a manner similar to Space Invaders. Fry is unable to destroy the final ship, which lands nearby. The invaders emerge and demand \"a million allowances worth of quarters\" with which to do their laundry. The Earthlings refuse. The invaders suggest they be allowed to throw their laundry in with Earth's as a compromise, and the Earthlings agree.\nLeela asks what if she found her true home. However, when the lever is pulled to start the simulation, it hits Leela on the head and knocks her unconscious, prompting her to dream a parody of \"The Wizard of Oz\" with Leela as Dorothy, Nibbler as Toto, Amy as Glinda the Good Witch, Fry as the Scarecrow, Bender as the Tin Man, Zoidberg as the Cowardly Lobster, and Professor Fansworth as the Professor of Oz.\nLeela and Nibbler, while riding in the Planet Express ship, are taken by tornado to Oz. The ship's landing gear lands on the Wicked Witch of the East, killing her. Leela takes the witch's magic boots from her corpse and puts them on, since it is hard to find footwear in her size. She asks Amy for help getting back home, and Amy tells her that only The Professor at the Emerald Laboratory can send her home. Leela is joined in her quest by Fry, Bender, and Zoidberg. They all are captured by Wicked Witch Mom who asks Leela to be her witch daughter. Leela happily agrees, but when Bender pops opens a celebratory bottle of champagne, the spilled liquid causes Mom to melt into nothing. They resume their journey to the Emerald Laboratory, where The Professor tells Leela to click her boot heels together and wish to be sent back home. Instead, she uses them to become a witch and turns Fry, Bender and The Professor into toads. However, a toilet overflow in the upstairs bathroom (caused by Zoidberg's use of it) leaks through the ceiling and onto Leela, causing her to melt. She wakes up to find Bender splashing water in her face and berates the crew for showing up in her wonderful dream and ruining it.\n\nIn a split-second establishing shot of New New York before the Professor's press conference, the towers of the World Trade Center are seen. This episode aired on January 6, 2002, about 4 months after the towers were destroyed.<br>\nThe song that Bender becomes infatuated with as a human is \"Conga\" by Gloria Estefan. The title of the segment is a nod to the Isaac Asimov collection of short stories \"I, Robot\".\n\nThe \"Raiders of the Lost Arcade\" segment is a \"non-stop barrage of game references\" with jokes and allusions referencing a wide array of classic video games. The title is a reference to the 1981 film \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\". The segment starts off with a sequence from \"Asteroids\". \"Ambassador Kong\" is a reference to the arcade game \"Donkey Kong\", as is Italy's ambassador to the U.N. being Mario. The maze which the characters run through is an homage to both \"Pac-Man\" and \"Ms. Pac-Man\". Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man both appear in the episode (Pac-Man as General Colin Pacman, and Ms. Pac-Man as his wife/widow).\nThe Nintendians' fleet is composed of \"Space Invaders\" ships, which move in the same pattern as those in the video game (\"Drop down, increase speed, and reverse direction!\"). Fry plays to the accompaniment of a cassette tape of \"Tom Sawyer\" by Rush. The planet Nintendu 64 is a reference to the game console Nintendo 64. When the Milatari HQ is first shown, the green tank from \"Battlezone\" is driving past. When the characters walk through the HQ, they go past doors labelled Moon Patrol and Missile Command. As the video game villains (Lrrr, Donkey Kong, a Berzerk robot, a Robotron brain, \"BurgerTime\"s Mr. Egg, and Q*bert) exit the landed ship, one character says the phrase \"All your base are belong to us\".\n\nThe majority of the plot is a direct parody of the 1939 film \"The Wizard of Oz\", with Leela taking the place of Dorothy, Amy as the Good Witch of the North, Fry as the Scarecrow, Bender as the Tin Man, Zoidberg as the Cowardly Lion, Professor Farnsworth as the Wizard and Mom as the Wicked Witch of the West. When Leela first exits the spaceship, a parody of the NBC peacock logo is seen spreading its feathers.\nIn 2006, IGN.com ranked this episode as the series' twelfth best, with \"Anthology of Interest I\" at number 13, in their list of the \"Top 25 Futurama episodes\". Zack Handlen of \"The A.V. Club\" gave the episode a B.\nIn its initial airing, the episode received a Nielsen rating of 4.5, placing it 62nd among primetime shows for the week of December 31, 2001 – January 6, 2002.\n\n"}

It has been identified as the stronghold of Pāpak Khorramdin, the leader of the Khurramites in Azarbaijan who fought the Islamic caliphate of Abbassids. Iranian Azarbaijanis gather at Babak Castle during the first weekend in July for the annual commemoration of Babak Khorramdin.\n\nThe ascent to the Castle is not for the infirm, elderly, or those afraid of heights. A series of long, and in places, broken steps lead the traveler to the top of a hill from where there are several choices for further ascent. The easiest is straight in front of the steps and consists of a long dirt track. As there are no sign posts towards the Castle, walk towards the peak on your left hand side but do not leave the dirt track. You will need hiking boots, a sun hat, plenty of water, and at least 3 hours for the climb, and 2 hours for the descent. At the end of the dirt track, turn left onto the rocky mountain side, and beware of slipping. The first of sign of the ruins will appear on your left, but do not become too complacent: the actual Castle is another 2 peaks march away. The first peak has views of the Castl. After ascending a second peak, with its own ruins, you will see the Castle perched on top a jagged cliff. Ascending the Castle steps is a dangerous process, as there are sheer cliffs on your right hand side, and no protective rails or fences to prevent a fall of several hundred meters. Take extreme care of the edge, and hold on to your children. Once you have climbed the pinnacle of the cliff, you will truly appreciated the amazing effort in building and maintaining a fort at this altitude. Unfortunately, you will also have to tolerate the graffiti on the ancient walls, and young people playing chicken on top of the Castle walls. Under no circumstances should you even consider climbing these walls: first, this can damage the ancient structure, and second, a fall of several thousands of meters would lead to certain death. Nevertheless, the experience afterward is well worth the strenuous climb: the surrounding Arasbaran oak forest, jagged cliffs, mountains in the distance, and the history of the place combine to create one of Iran's most beautiful vistas.\nThe castle, built on 2300-2600 meter heights, surrounded by gorges as deep as 400 to 600 meters, is believed to belong to the Parthian dynasty and modified under the Sasanid dynasty. To reach the castle, one has to trek a tortuous and narrow passageway and then cross a corridor-shaped temple, 200 meters in lengths.\n\n\n"}

In chapter four, she explains in detail why she decided to focus her study on childbirth: \"I never chose to study birth. In some sense, birth chose me.\"\n\nJordan's work argues against romanticized perspectives of \"early, less complex societies\" that present childbirth as uncomplicated. Instead, she suggests that childbirth is a life-altering event in all societies, but can be understood differently by using a cross-cultural perspective. In their edited collection, \"Childbirth and Authoritative Knowledge: Cross-Cultural Perspectives\", Robbie E. Davis-Floyd and Carolyn F. Sargent praised the book for focusing \"anthropological attention on childbirth as a subject worthy of in-depth ethnographic fieldwork and cross-cultural comparison, and that inspired many others to enter the field.\"\n\nJordan argues that birth should be examined utilizing a biosocial approach, which recognizes birth as a biological process that is shaped by social and cultural practices. Along with a concern for medical safety, Jordan also focuses on \"maternal attitudes and participation in birth, the birth setting, and the mother's selection of birth attendants.\" Jordan uses her observations in the field, alongside academic anthropological sources to analyze birth as it occurs in four different societies.\n\nAs an ethnographer, Jordan and her collaborator Nancy Fuller incorporated qualitative and quantitative approaches to compare health policies and statistical data from the four birthing systems. Jordan employed formal and informal interviews based on her participant observation. In particular, she used technological means of data collection, such as videotaping and tape recording devices, to record and review her findings and produce high-quality documentation. Jordan reflects upon the methodological and ethical responsibility in her research to justify the decision-making process of the biosocial framework.\n\nIn 1980, Jordan received the Margaret Mead Award in recognition for \"Birth in Four Cultures\".\n\nWhile much of the reception for \"Birth in Four Cultures\" has been overwhelmingly positive, some anthropologists have criticized Jordan for her exclusive focus on the social aspects of birth without much attention to religious or ideological concerns in her research.\n\n\"Birth in Four Cultures\" was one of the first ethnographies to study cross-cultural systems of birth. Jordan argued that economics, culture, and politics affect birth as a system, which led to the beginning of the sub-category of anthropology called Anthropology of Birth.\n\n\"Birth in Four Cultures\" has been used to advocate for preserving midwifery care in developing countries.\n\nThere have been four editions of the book in 1978, 1980, 1983, and 1993, including updates to the material from Jordan's continued research on the subject. The 4th edition was revised and expanded by anthropologist Robbie Davis-Floyd.\n"}

It is thought to be the last Victorian steam-driven brickworks left in the UK.\n\nThe brick kiln, chimney, drying sheds, and the boiler and engine house at the south section of the brickworks are listed Grade II* as a group on the National Heritage List for England.\n\nBursledon Brickworks started out in 1897 as \"Hooper & Ashby\", a Southampton-based builders' merchants, who also made bricks. The company was co-founded by the Ashby's and the Hooper's two separate Quaker families, both hailing from the town of Staines in Middlesex (now part of the county of Surrey). Edward Hooper, who moved to Southampton at the age of 26 was a civil engineer and architect. In the 1851 census records, Edward is described as being both an engineer and a brick maker. He takes out a lease on Baltic Wharf in Chapel Road. It is here that Edward sets up a business as a builders' merchant and a manufacturer trading in slate. This is followed by the expansion of his business, when he takes out a lease on a second building, American Wharf, nine-years later. \n\nIn 1903, \"Hooper & Ashby\" changed its name to \"The Bursledon Brick Co. Limited\" or \"(B.B.C. Ltd.),\" this coincided with the extension of the southern complex with the addition of the northern complex. This was further extended in 1935. With the extra capacity, the brickworks was producing in excess of 20 million bricks a year. They were one of the main producers of bricks in the region. Most of the original machinery was moved to the Swanwick site from Chandler's Ford.\n\nOn 20 March, Bursledon Brickworks F.C. beat North Warnborough 4–1 in the semi-finals of the 1926 Hants Junior Cup. The cricket team, Lower Swanwick B.C.C. won the Sarisbury and District Cricket League Division 2 championship shield.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the family business was amalgamated with the Sussex and Dorking Brick Company and in 1959 became Redland Holdings Ltd.\n\nThe brickworks finally closed in 1974, and the site was later saved from demolition by the \"Hampshire Buildings Preservation Trust\". The south section of Bursledon Brickworks which houses the brick kiln, chimney, drying sheds, boiler and engine house are Grade II* listed. The north section was demolished and the land was acquired by the National Air Traffic Services. \"NATS\" operate the London Area Control Centre and London Terminal Control Centre. As site owners, they have provided funding for the Swanwick Lakes Wildlife Reserve project managed by the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust.\n\nThe Bursledon Brickworks Trust which ran from July 1997 – February 2007 was replaced by the Bursledon Brickworks Museum Trust in November 2016.\n\nIn 2012, the Heritage Lottery Fund granted the museum funding of £666,300 to open up the first floor of the building, create two more education spaces and employ some paid staff. Project manager Carolyne Haynes said: “We’re always under threat, in that it’s a big building that’s permanently trying to fall down and we’re permanently trying to keep it open, running it with volunteers. The most important thing about this money is we’ll be able to pay some staff to make sure we can open three days a week – that will give us a regular opening time.\n\n“The place deserves to be recognised nationally and this is a big first step towards that.”\n\nThe grant will also help pay for improved disabled access for the museum, in Coal Park Lane, Swanwick.\n\nHead of the South-East’s Heritage Lottery Fund, Stuart McLeod, said: “Our industrial heritage is something we should be hugely proud of – it helped build the world we live in today. Bursledon Brickworks is the perfect example of this and an incredible survivor of its time.”\n\nAt the heart of the museum, and the heart of the collection, is the original brick making machinery, steam engine and related smaller equipment, such as barrows, shovels and wagons, once used at Bursledon Brickworks. The steam engine and machinery were restored about 20 years ago and are operated on special events.\n\nThe brickworks has two entrances to the site, the first on Swanwick Lane. This entrance is used by the general public and has a car park. This is also where coaches drop off passengers (group visits) and the rear entrance on Coal Park Lane. The Coal Park Lane entrance is mainly used by the staff and/or volunteers based at the site, and is where deliveries are overseen.\n\nBack in July 2015, BBC Radio Solent presenter Nick Girdler visited the brickworks. Here he oversaw the unveiling of a new brick sculpture, affectionately known as \"the Twisted Shard\". The structure which took 5 months to build was designed by local brick lecturer and artist Joe Taylor from Woolston, Southampton, in partnership with Michelmersh Brick Holdings. He enlisted the help of some of his Southampton City College students to aid in the construction of \"the Twisted Shard\". Later that same year, the brickworks was featured in the last five minutes of the BBC's – \"VE Day: First Days of Peace\" documentary.\n\nIn January 2017, a five-minute segment on Bursledon Brickworks featured on Series 14: Episode 6 of the BBC One television programme Antiques Road Trip. A month later, the museum welcomed wine connoisseur Peter Richards from Saturday Kitchen.\n\n"}

They are considered one of the most important modernist architectural firms in post-war England.\n\nThe practice was founded in 1952 by Geoffry Powell (1920–1999), Peter \"Joe\" Chamberlin (1919–1978) and Christoph Bon (1921–1999), following Powell's win in the 1951 architectural competition for the Golden Lane Estate. The three founding partners taught at Kingston Polytechnic (now Kingston University School of Architecture) when they each entered the design competition with the agreement that should any of them win they would form a partnership with the other two to deliver the project. The Golden Lane Estate is sometimes referred to as the apprentice piece of the practice and is important for its planned landscape which 'straddles the boundary between the picturesque and the formal'.\n\nCharles Greenberg became an additional partner of the practice in 1960, although he chose not to add his name to the partnership for personal reasons. He was the only other partner working with CP&B on Barbican. Frank Woods also became an additional partner, and in 1985 the firm name became Chamberlin Powell Bon & Woods. The firm continued to 1989. Its records are archived at the Royal Institute of British Architects.\n\nFollowing completion of the Golden Lane Estate, they won the commission to design and execute the adjacent Barbican development, also for the Corporation of the City of London, the wealthy municipal administration that has responsibility for the historic core of London, today the central business district. The Barbican was such a large job they set up a sub-practice to deal with it: Chamberlin Powell and Bon (Barbican) Ltd.\n\nThe firm was strongly influenced by the work and ideas of Swiss/French architect Le Corbusier, with the essence of the innovative design being encapsulated by the project architect Leopold Rubinstein who trained with Le Corbusier in Paris. Other works included two schools in London, New Hall, Cambridge (a new college at Cambridge University) now known as Murray Edwards College, and an ambitious materplan and major expansion of the campus at University of Leeds.\n\nIt is a measure of the importance of the practice in post-war British architecture that many of their works are now Listed Buildings.\n\n\n"}

Thus, the front endpapers precede the title page and the text, whereas the back endpapers follow the text. Booksellers sometimes refer to the front endpaper as FEP. \n\nBefore mass printing in the 20th century it was common for the endpapers of books to have paper marbling. Sometimes the endpapers are used for maps or other relevant information. They are the traditional place to put bookplates, or an owner's inscription.\n\n, there are many styles of endsheets or endpapers that are specifically designed for use with different bindings. For example, endsheets reinforced with cloth are used in sewn bindings. The cloth holds the stitches and prevents the paper from perforating and tearing.\n\nOther styles are designed for use with perfect binders. Combined and Universal Endsheets are loaded into the cover feeder of an automatic perfect binder and attached – instead of the soft cover – automatically producing a book block reinforced from head to tail.

{"id": "301456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=301456", "title": "Happy ending", "text": "Happy ending\n\nA happy ending is an ending of the plot of a work of fiction in which almost everything turns out for the best for the protagonists, their sidekicks, and almost everyone except the villains.\n\nIn storylines where the protagonists are in physical danger, a happy ending mainly consists of their survival and successful completion of the quest or mission; where there is no physical danger, a happy ending may be lovers consummating their love despite various factors which may have thwarted it. A considerable number of storylines combine both situations. In Steven Spielberg's version of \"War of the Worlds\", the happy ending consists of three distinct elements: The protagonists all survive the countless perils of their journey; humanity as a whole survives the alien invasion; \"and\" the protagonist father regains the respect of his estranged children. The plot is so constructed that all three are needed for the audience's feeling of satisfaction in the end. \n\nA happy ending is epitomized in the standard fairy tale ending phrase, \"happily ever after\" or \"and they lived happily ever after\". (\"One Thousand and One Nights\" has the more restrained formula \"they lived happily until there came to them the One who Destroys all Happiness\" (i.e. Death); likewise, the Russian versions of fairy tales typically end with \"they lived long and happily, and died together on the same day\".) Satisfactory happy endings are happy for the reader as well, in that the characters he or she sympathizes with are rewarded. However, this can also serve as an open path for a possible sequel. For example, in the 1977 film \"Star Wars\", Luke Skywalker defeats the Galactic Empire by destroying the Death Star; however, the story's happy ending has consequences that follow in \"The Empire Strikes Back\". The concept of a permanent happy ending is specifically brought up in the Stephen King fantasy/fairy tale novel \"The Eyes of the Dragon\" which has a standard good ending for the genre, but simply states that \"there were good days and bad days\" afterwards.\n\nA happy ending only requires that the main characters be all right. Millions of innocent background characters can die, but as long as the characters that the reader/viewer/audience cares about survive, it can still be a happy ending. Roger Ebert comments in his review of Roland Emmerich's \"The Day After Tomorrow\": \"Billions of people may have died, but at least the major characters have survived. Los Angeles is leveled by multiple tornadoes, New York is buried under ice and snow, the United Kingdom is flash-frozen, and lots of the Northern Hemisphere is wiped out for good measure. Thank god that Jack, Sam, Laura, Jason and Dr. Lucy Hall survive, along with Dr. Hall's little cancer patient.\"\n\nThe presence of a happy ending is one of the key points that distinguish melodrama from tragedy. In certain periods, the endings of traditional tragedies such as \"Macbeth\" or \"Oedipus Rex\", in which most of the major characters end up dead, disfigured, or discountenanced, have been actively disliked. In the Seventeenth Century, the Irish author Nahum Tate sought to improve William Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" in his own heavily modified version in which Lear survives and Cordelia marries Edgar. Tate's version dominated performances for a century and a half, Shakespeare's original nearly forgotten. Both David Garrick and John Philip Kemble, while taking up some of Shakespeare's original text, kept Tate's happy ending. Edmund Kean played \"King Lear\" with its tragic ending in 1823, but failed and reverted to Tate's crowd-pleaser after only three performances. Only in 1838 did William Macready at Covent Garden successfully restore Shakespeare's original tragic end – Helen Faucit's final appearance as Cordelia, dead in her father's arms, became one of the most iconic of Victorian images and the play's tragic end was finally accepted by the general public. Most subsequent critics have not found Tate's amendments an improvement, and welcomed the restoration of Shakespeare's original. Happy endings have also been fastened – equally, with no lasting success – to \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Othello\". \n\nThere is no universally accepted definition of what a happy ending is; such definitions can considerably vary with time and cultural differences. An interpretation of \"The Merchant of Venice\"s forced conversion of Shylock to Christianity is that it was intended as a happy ending. As a Christian, Shylock could no longer impose interest, undoing his schemes in the play and ending the rivalry between him and Antonio, but more important, contemporary audiences would see becoming a Christian as a means to save his soul (cf. Romans 11:15). In later times, Jews (and non-Jewish opponents of anti-Semitism) strongly objected to that ending, regarding it as depicting a victory for injustice and oppression and as pandering to the audience's prejudices.\n\nMost interpretations of the legend of Don Juan end with the protagonist rake being dragged off to Hell, in just retribution for his many sins (for example, the ending of Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\"). However, José Zorrilla - whose 1844 play \"Don Juan Tenorio\" is the version most well-known in the Spanish-speaking world - believed that a story should never end sadly, and must always have a happy ending. In Zorrilla's depiction, Don Juan is saved at the last moment from the flames of Hell by the selfless pure love of Doña Inés, a woman whom he wronged but who forgave him; she had made a deal with God to offer her own blameless soul on behalf of Don Juan's - thus redeeming Don Juan and taking him with her to Paradise.\n\nA \"Times\" review of \"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\" strongly criticized John le Carré for failing to provide a happy ending, and gave unequivocal reasons why in the reviewer's opinion (shared by many others) such an ending is needed: \"The hero must triumph over his enemies, as surely as Jack must kill the giant in the nursery tale. If the giant kills Jack, we have missed the whole point of the story.\"\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw had to wage an uphill struggle against audiences, as well as some critics, persistently demanding that his \"Pygmalion\" have a happy ending, i.e. that Professor Higgins and Eliza Doolitle would ultimately get married. To Shaw's great chagrin, [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] who presented the play in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1914 had sweetened the ending and told Shaw: \"My ending makes money; you ought to be grateful. Your ending is damnable; you ought to be shot.\" The irritated Shaw added a postscript essay, \"'What Happened Afterwards\", to the 1916 print edition, for inclusion with subsequent editions, in which he explained precisely why in his view it was impossible for the story to end with Higgins and Eliza getting married. Nevertheless, audiences continued wanting a happy ending also for later adaptations such as the musical and film \"[[My Fair Lady]]\".\n\nIn numerous cases, [[Hollywood]] studios adapting literary works into film added a happy ending which did not appear in the original. \n\n\n[[Category:Endings]]\n[[Category:Narratology]]\n[[Category:Fiction]]\n[[Category:Plot (narrative)]]\n[[Category:Recurrent elements in fairy tales]]"}

A human video consists of a song or medley played over loudspeakers while actors use rhythmic physical movement (gestures and other movements of the limbs and body) to communicate emotions to a given audience.\n\nThe performance is presented in a form similar to a music video. It presents a story that illuminates a particular artistic intent through spatial relationships, meaningful gestures, and artistic movement. \n\nThe story told within the video can be either implicit in the words of the song or a story written independently of the original artist's meaning.\n\nJust as more \"traditional\" forms of theater can be situated on different types of stages, so too can these dramatic acts. This particular form of drama can perform the same text in many different venues without disrupting its meaning. Because it typically has no set and limited costumes, it can be performed in nearly any location.\n\nProps are sometimes used, but are forbidden in some competitive venues. In this instance, props are restricted in an effort to force creativity—because in the ideal Human Video, all actors on stage should be used to represent objects like crosses, thrones, trees or giants. Actors movements demonstrate a story and the theme of the song being played.\n\nIn the United States, one example of how human videos have permeated the culture is the inclusion of human videos in Fine Arts Festivals and church ministry groups (Assemblies of God, Pentecostal Holiness Church, Church of God, etc.) in a variety of Protestant denominations. The Fine Arts Festival in the Assemblies of God denomination is the largest and most intense of all competitions and categories. Churches spend many months and countless hours practicing in order to receive recognition at the National Fine Arts Festival.\n\nThe name \"human video\" was coined by Randy Phillips. He is reported to have performed the first \"human video\" in a chapel service at Central Bible College, with several elements used from the then quite popular Deaf Ministry Team.

It was the southern Illyrians who minted the first coins followed by the northern Illyrian during the Roman era. Illyrian coins have also been found in other areas apart from Illyria, such ancient Macedonia, Italy, Greece, Asia Minor and Egypt.\n\nThe earliest Illyrian coins were probably minted by the Tyntenoi north of Lake Ohrid minted coins around 540 BC with the Greek legend Tynteni. Their silver coins reached Italy, Egypt and many parts of Asia. They belonged to the group of 'Thraco-Macedonian' coinages of this period, and they bore the same emblems as the coins of Ichnae at the head of the Thermaic Gulf. Production ceased in the early 5th century BC, most likely in 475 BC when this period was one of comparative poverty, during which contacts were lost with mainland Greece and relations with Ionia via the Danube valley slackened.\n\nThe Messapians in southern Italy minted coins in the early 5th century BC. They were an early imitation of the Greek coins from Magna Grecia. The cities which minted these early mints were Valesio, Brindisi, Nardò, Oria, Ugento, Grax and Samadi. Valesio struck silver coins, Nardò silver and bronze while from the 3rd century BC only bronze coins were issued. The coins feature Lapagus, an ancient Iapygian hero. Other features included Athena, Heracles and Zeus.\n\nAt the same time as the Messapians, the Paeonian tribe of the Derrones were also producing coins. These coins are traditionally dated to 500 BC – 450 BC. Frequent depictions on the coins attributed to the Derrones are Oxen and Corinthian helmets. Their god, Darr(h)on, was worshipped by Paionians and Macedonians. The Paeonian kings dealt greatly and seriously with the minting coins. However this activity in terms of quality and appearance did not differ much from Greek coins. Even the Paeonians themselves at this time were becoming hellenized more and more and lost to a great degree their characteristic as a non-Greek people.\n\nThe earliest Illyrian coins in Illyria were minted from the start of the 4th century BC in the Illyrian city of Damastion and Daparria by the Illyrian tribe of the Dyestes under Bardylis, which had been influenced by Hellenization to an extent. For about 200 years, this city minted silver coins with symbols imitating those of the Hellenic cities in the Aegean, as well as original symbols such as tongs of a metal smelter. The circulation of Damastion coins included Kosovo, southern Serbia, Macedonia and the Adriatic coast from Shkodër to Split. The presence of silver mines around the city in ancient sources made it possible for the minting of coins in such a great abundance.\n\nThe only kings to have minted coins bearing their names were Lycceius, Patraus, Audoleon, Monunius, Mytilus, Gentius and Ballaios.\n\nThe coinage of Patraus is remarkable. They have on the obverse a head of Apollo, which may be in allusion to the king's name, Apollo being known under the name of Patraus. On the reverse of the coins is a horseman riding over an enemy, in allusion to triumphs over the Macedonians and an inscription of the king.\n\nThe coins of Audoleon have a head wearing a Corinthian helmet on the obverse and on the reverse a horse stepping, very boldly executed and the inscription of the king.\n\nThe first Dardanian king to have minted silver coins was Monunius in the beginning of the 3rd century BC, around 280 BC. He struck his coins in the Greek colony of Durrës and they differed only in having the jaw of a boar set over the cow, as a symbol of the royal Illyrian house. The coins also had the abbreviated inscription 'ΔYP' (for Durrës) to donate the place where they were minted, as well as showing royal sovereignty over the city. These coins have been found in great numbers in the Illyrian city of Gurëzeza, and in the interior of Albania beyond Apollonia. The Illyrian kingdom under Monunius extended as far as the Lyncestian Lakes, and from here Monunius could have intervened in the quarrel about the Macedonian throne, eventually turning into a claimant for it. This surely is the meaning of the minting of a second series of silver coins bearing his name and traditional Macedonian symbols, the head of Heracles on the face and on the reverse, Olympian Zeus sitting on his throne. That this, was a short lived dream of the Illyrian king is shown by the fact that so few coins were minted, so much that only one specimen is preserved today.\n\nMytilus, the successor of King Monunius, struck his coins 10 years later around 270 BC. His bronze coinage with the symbols of the city of Durrës in Albania bear his name. The coinage of Apollonia in the same period bore only his monogram, as well as symbols similar to those of the Aetolian League.\n\nThe most productive conage is of Gentius who ruled from 181 BC. Two of his mints were located in Shkodra, the ancient Illyrian capital at the time of his regn, and in Lezha, both located in modern-day north-eastern Albania. His coins were also struck in Durrës, where the royal title is absent from any silver coin, and the name Gentius, not uncommon to an Illyrian male, may belong not to the king but to a local magistrate. However, around 30 to 40 examples of bronze coins have been recorded with the legend 'King Genthios'. Upon his defeat by the Romans in 168 BC his treasury of 120,000 silver pieces were conveyed to Rome.\n\nBallaios reigned after the kingdom of Gentius was dissolved into the Roman Empire from around 167 BC – 135 BC. The abundance of the coinage of Ballaios in the region would suggest that he was a powerful and influential king although no literary of historical evidence of him exists. The coins of the well-known king Gentius are scarce in comparison to the coins of Ballaios. His silver issues are rare, but bronze coins (without the royal title) occur on Hvar in Croatia, both in single finds and in hoards, and at Rhizon, the ancient capital of Queen Teuta, in a different series bearing the royal title. The coins of Ballaios were widely imitated in the region, sometimes so crudely that they are unintelligible. Ballaios struck coins in two cities: Pharos and Rhizon. The weight of the bronze coins are between 1.0 and 4.5 g, while most of the documented specimens weigh between 2.0 and 2.5 g. The relativity great impact of the coinage of Ballaios is indicated by a large number of imitations of his coins. His coins are found in both the eastern Adriatic shores and frequently in Italy, which confirms the trade contacts between the two Adriatic coasts.\n\nOn the obverse of his coins a bust of the king facing left to right is depicted, while on the reverse Artemis (advancing or standing) is represented, with or without a torch and sometimes carrying one or two spears. It is significant that Ballaios also had silver coins minted, which indicates his wealth and power, since elsewhere in Dalmatia, silver coinage is very rarely documented from the Greek and Illyrian mints.\n\nThe coins of ancient Lissus, modern-day Lezha, with the legend 'LISSITAN' began with autonomous issues under the Macedonian influences (211 BC – 197 BC). The coins were followed later by the issues of Gentius with a ship on the reverse and a third series from the period after the kings removal. Lissus minted coins on behalf of the community of the Lissians and minted a rare coin with an inscription over the head of an Illyrian god wearing a causia type hat. The face depicted on the Lissian coins was originally though to be of King Gentius, although Albanian archaeologist, Hasan Ceka was proved it to by the head of the Illyrian sea god, Rodon. The head of Artemis and an Illyrian shield is depicted on some Lissian coins. The Shkodra coins fall into three similar groups, the first and third with the legend 'SKODRI-NON' and the second with the legend of king Gentius. In the city of Rhizon a mint was established that issued several coinages. These incleded autonomous coinages of the town, in bronze, the royal coinage of king Ballaios, in silver and bronze, most probably, the coinage labeled “Coinage from the Rhizonian Gulf”, which has been considered as the coinage of an alliance in which Rhizon played a part, in silver and bronze.\nThe chronology of these coinages is still not defined with precision, primarily because the historical background of their issuance remains little known. There is hardly any mention in the literary sources of the town of Rhizon, and none of the king Ballaios. However, several features of these coinages - such as the characteristics of style, elements of inscription and iconography (especially the presence of the title “basileus” on the coinage of Ballaios, and the presence of a Macedonian shield on the “Coinage from the Rhizonian Gulf”), metrology, choice of coined metals, etc. – point to the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE as the general chronological framework for the activity of the Rhizonian mint and for the successive issuance of the coinages of different issuing authorities there. Around Lake Scutari the Labeates issued a rare type of bronze coin, bearing the head of an Illyrian deity and a Liburnian warship with a dolphin swimming underneath. Between 217 BC and 84 BC the city of Oria in Italy minted coins with the head of Lapagus, the ancient Iapygian hero. In Daorson the capital of the Daorsi in modern Bosnia, 39 different coins (29 bearing the image of King Ballaios from 168 BC, and 9 with a Greek inscription and a boat image) have been discovered. Money was of immense importance to the Daorsi, ensuring the tribe's independence while also confirming their well developed business, cultural and trade links with other peoples. Illyrian coins also appeare in other ancient cities especially those in the south of Illyria, such as in the Illyrian/Greek cities of Byllis, Amantia, Pelion and Olympe. The koinon of the Bylliones centred on the city of Byllis minted its own bronze coins. The first coins came out around 270 BC and continued until 167 BC when the Romans dissolved the koinon.\n\n\n"}

She made her directorial and screenwriting feature film debut in 2007 with \"Unrelated\".\n\nAfter leaving school in the late 1970s, Hogg worked as a photographer and began to make experimental super-8 films after borrowing a camera from Derek Jarman, who became an early mentor after a chance meeting in Patisserie Valerie in Soho. One of these, a film about a kinetic sculpture by artist Ron Haselden, won her a place to study direction at the National Film and Television School. Her graduation piece \"Caprice\" starred a then unknown Tilda Swinton. On graduation, Hogg directed several music videos for artists such as Alison Moyet, and won her first television commission writing and directing a programme segment for Janet Street Porter's Channel Four series \"Network 7\", \"Flesh + Blood\". In the 1990s, Hogg directed episodes of \"London Bridge\", \"Casualty\" and \"London's Burning\". She also directed the \"EastEnders\" special \"EastEnders: Dot's Story\" (2003).\n\nHogg has said, \"I wanted to make a film doing everything I was told not to do in television.\" She shot her first feature, \"Unrelated\" (2008), in Tuscany. It tells the story of a childless woman, Anna (Kathryn Worth), of around forty who goes on holiday to Italy with her friend Verena (Mary Roscoe) and her teenage family. Over the course of the holiday, tensions emerge as Anna spends less time with the 'grown-ups' and is drawn towards the teenage crowd and the attractions of Verena's teenage nephew (Tom Hiddleston).\n\nThe film received critical acclaim, premiering at the London Film Festival in 2007 and winning the FIPRESCI International Critics Award. It also won the Guardian First Film Award in 2008 and the Evening Standard British Film Awards 'Most Promising Newcomer' Award in 2009, as well as being nominated for their Best Film Award and earning Hogg a nomination for the London Film Critics' Circle 'Breakthrough Filmmaker' Award in 2009.\n\nHer second film, \"Archipelago\", shot on the island of Tresco had its UK premiere at the 2010 London Film Festival, where it was nominated in the Best Film category. It was released in the UK on 4 March 2011 by Artificial Eye.\n\nHer third film \"Exhibition\" starred musician Viv Albertine and artist Liam Gillick and also featured Hogg's long time collaborator Tom Hiddleston. The film premiered at the Locarno Film Festival in 2013. Peter Bradshaw writing in \"The Guardian\" hailed is as 'a masterful cinematic enigma' awarding it the full five stars.\n\nHogg's style is influenced by European and Asian directors such as Eric Rohmer and Yasujirō Ozu, using extended takes and minimal camera movement. She takes the unusual approach of casting a mixture of actors and non-professional actors in her films, such as the landscape painter Christopher Baker in \"Archipelago\". Her depiction of unarguably middle-class characters has prompted some commentators to see her work as spearheading a new type of social realism in British film.\n\nIn 2015 Hogg directed Harold Pinter's unproduced film screenplay adaptation of the short story by Karen Blixen \"The Dreaming Child\" for Radio 4, adapting the screenplay with producer Laurence Bowen. It starred Lydia Leonard, who worked with Hogg on her film \"Archipelago\", and Bertie Carvel.\n\nIn October 2015 Hogg co-curated the retrospective exhibition of film maker Chantal Akerman's installation work, \"Chantal Akerman NOW\", at the Ambika P3 Gallery. This was the culmination of a two year long retrospective of Akerman's work she had programmed with Adam Roberts, with whom she founded the cinema collective A Nos Amours in 2011. The collective is \"dedicated to programming over-looked, under-exposed or especially potent cinema\". In an interview, Hogg cited a concern that 'A new generation is growing up who actually don’t know the work of directors like Tarkovsky.', as a major motivation behind establishing the collective.\n\n\n"}

From 1844 to 1851, he studied with Rafał Hadziewicz, one of his father's former students, at the School of Fine Arts in Warsaw. His most important influences, however, came from Jan Feliks Piwarski, a landscape painter who was one of the first in Poland to promote the concept of painting en plein aire. He joined a group led by January Suchodolski that travelled on painting and drawing excursions throughout the country.\n\nIn 1853, he received a scholarship and went to Saint Petersburg to enroll at the Imperial Academy of Arts, where he studied with the battle painter, Bogdan Willewalde. He graduated in 1856 and, the following year, went to Paris to study in the studios of Horace Vernet. After a year there, he travelled in Italy, then returned to Warsaw and remained there the rest of his life.\n\nHe is primarily known for his landscapes and battle scenes. One of the most notable is a large canvas depicting King John II Casimir Vasa at the Battle of Berestechko, done together with Juliusz Kossak. Horses are a prominent feature in most of his works.

The film features Deborah Tranelli as its protagonist, actress-turned-vigilante Carla Harris. The film has since received a cult following and is often mentioned in works discussing films of the rape and revenge genre.\n\nCarla Harris is living the American dream. She has a handsome and wealthy husband, Mark. On their way home from a restaurant, they spot a man attacking a woman. Mark tries to help but is killed. The man escapes when the police arrive. Russo, an officer, goes to her house and tells her that there are no witnesses. Russo says that he will contact her if they find anything.\n\nOn the way to her parents' house, Carla stops at a gas station where she sees her old boyfriend Burke and one of Burke's friends, Sparky. Later that night, Carla goes to a club and meets her old high school friends, her best friend Estelle and her husband Slob. Carla also meets David but Estelle doesn't like him. After being accosted by Burke, the local butcher, Carla goes home. While she is changing, she notices Timmy, the gardener spying on her. Later that night, the men break into her house and rape her. When her parents return, Burke grabs Mr. Harris's shotgun and kills them, as well as Timmy.\n\nMeanwhile, in the hospital, Carla wakes up and tells the doctor that she wants revenge. Later that night, she escapes from the hospital. She goes to the closed bar, seduces the bartender and convinces him to pour wine all over his body. She steals his gun, then throws a candle at him, leaving him to burn. The next day, Carla finds Burke in his speedboat. She grabs a knife on the boat and stabs him. She then takes a grapple and throws it through his chest. She ties the other end to his boat and starts the boat, making him drown and then escapes. Carla then sneaks to Sparky's gas station. While Sparky is working on a car, Carla drops the car on him, killing him. Later that night, Carla goes to Arnie's ice company. Carla pushes Arnie in the ice cube maker. A block of ice pushes him in the cube hole, leaving him to die.\n\nCarla goes to the ice truck when Fletch, the gang and some town locals spot her and chase her to her parents' house. Carla blocks the doors and hides in a corner. The men start to burn the house down, but Carla goes into the basement and escapes through a vent. When the Sheriff asks Fletch about the burning, he claims he knew nothing about it. Later that night, Fletch is alone in the butcher shop. Carla arrives and the two fight. Carla finds the shotgun that Fletch used to kill her family and kills him with it.\n\nTwo months later, in New York, Carla finds the man who killed her husband. She seduces him, then grabs his gun and shoots him. She then walks away in tears.\n\nThe film, a Westbook Brooks production in association with D.S., was directed by Cirio H. Santiago and was shot in New York City and Connecticut. The screenplay was written by Reilly Askew and Anthony Maharaj. While the film has been frequently thought of as an unofficial remake of Meir Zarchi's \"I Spit On Your Grave\" (1978) since both movies share a similar storyline, this claim has neither been refuted nor acknowledged.\n\nDeborah Tranelli, best known for her longtime role in the soap opera \"Dallas\", was cast as the lead character and protagonist, actress-turned-vigilante Carla Harris. Not having a stunt double, Tranelli did her own action exploits. The theme song was performed by her as well. Kaz Garas, Rosemarie Gil, Ed Crick, Nick Nicholson and Terrence O'Hara also star in the film, while Carmen Argenziano has a cameo appearance as a detective.\n\n\"AllMovie\" noted the film \"obviously takes its inspiration from \"I Spit On Your Grave\"\", but added that the film \"is likely to amuse exploitation fans\" due to it going to lengths to be more outrageous than its predecessor and becoming a self-parody by being overt in presentation of the heroine enduring a brutal rape and then having to witness her own parents being killed in front of her resulting in her seeking revenge. The reviewer cautioned viewers and concluded, \"The end result is as subtle as a flying mallet and ragged in both the acting and technical departments but Deborah Tranelli delivers a brave, surprisingly strong performance as the beleaguered heroine and the film uses that performance to its benefit by having her in the majority of its scenes. To sum up, \"Naked Vengeance\" might be derivative schlock but it has a certain crude effectiveness that will appeal to grindhouse fans.\n\nThe magazine \"Critical Condition\" (which focuses on \"obscure & bizarre films on video and DVD\") described \"Naked Vengeance\" as \" a perfectly crazy rip-off of \"I Spit on Your Grave\" (1978), maybe even outdoing it in sheer sleaze factor alone,\" and judges it to be Santiago's \"crowning achievement\". Using a methodology that polls viewers to measure their \"satisfaction\" with the picture, \"HBO's Guide to Movies on Videocassette and Cable TV\" gave this film a four-star rating.\n\nIn his short review for the \"Sydney Morning Herald\", David Frith described the character Harris as \"a sort of female Charles Bronson, wreaking bloody revenge on male hoodlums.\" In analysing the film in his work \"Screening the Male: Exploring Masculinities in the Hollywood Cinema\", Steve Cohan compares it with \"I Spit On Your Grave\" and postulates that the film's castration scene is a partial representation of \"a male death wish\". He adds that \"there is no doubt that the audience is intended to enjoy his save punishment\". A similar conclusion is made in \"Introduction to Film Studies\", in which author Jill Nelmes argues that \"Species\" samples elements from \"Naked Vengeance\" and \"I Spit On Your Grave\", whereas Annette Kuhn likens it to \"Violated\" (1984) and \"Shame\" (1987).\n\n"}

She wrote novels, short stories and essays, for which she received the Strega Prize and Bagutta Prize. Most of her works were also translated into English and published in the United Kingdom and United States.\n\nAn activist, for a time in the 1930s she belonged to the Italian Communist Party. In 1983 she was elected to Parliament from Rome as an Independent.\n\nBorn in Palermo, Sicily in 1916, Ginzburg spent most of her youth in Turin with her family, as her father in 1919 took a position with the University of Turin. Her father, Giuseppe Levi, a renowned Italian histologist, was born into a Jewish Italian family, and her mother, Lidia Tanzi, was Catholic. Her parents were secular and raised Natalia, her sister Paola (who would marry Adriano Olivetti) and her three brothers as atheists. Their home was a center of cultural life, as her parents invited intellectuals, activists and industrialists. At age 17 in 1933, Ginzburg published her first story, \"I bambini\", in the magazine \"Solaria\".\n\nIn 1938, she married Leone Ginzburg, and they had three children together, Carlo, Andrea, and Alessandra. Their son Carlo Ginzburg became a historian.\n\nAlthough Natalia Ginzburg was able to live relatively free of harassment during World War II, because of Leone's anti-Fascist activities, her husband was sent into internal exile, assigned from 1941–1943 to a poor village in Abruzzo. She and their children lived most of the time with him.\n\nOpponents of the Fascist regime, she and her husband secretly went to Rome and edited an anti-Fascist newspaper, until Leone Ginzburg was arrested. He died in 1944 after suffering severe torture, including crucifixion, in jail.\n\nIn 1950, Ginzburg married again, to Gabriele Baldini, a scholar of English literature. They lived in Rome. He died in 1969.\n\nAfter her marriage, she used the name \"Natalia Ginzburg\" (occasionally spelled \"Ginzberg\") on most subsequent publications. Her first novel was published under the pseudonym \"Alessandra Tornimparte\" in 1942, during Fascist Italy's most anti-Semitic period, when Jews were banned from publishing.\n\nGinzburg spent much of the 1940s working for the publisher Einaudi in Turin in addition to her creative writing. They published some of the leading figures of postwar Italy, including Carlo Levi, Primo Levi, Cesare Pavese and Italo Calvino. Ginzburg's second novel was published in 1947.\n\nThe experiences that she and her husband had during the war altered her perception of her identification as a Jew. She thought deeply about the questions aroused by the war and the Holocaust, dealing with them in fiction and essays. She converted to Catholicism, arousing controversy among her circle, because she believed that Christ was a persecuted Jew.\n\nBeginning in 1950, when Ginzburg married again and moved to Rome, she entered the most prolific period of her literary career. During the next 20 years, she published most of the works for which she is best known. She and Baldini were deeply involved in the cultural life of the city.\n\nIn 1964 she played the role of Mary of Bethany in Pier Paolo Pasolini's \"The Gospel According to St. Matthew\".\n\nGinzburg was politically involved throughout her life as an activist and polemicist. Like many prominent anti-Fascists, for a time she belonged to the Italian Communist Party. She was elected to the Italian Parliament as an Independent in 1983.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is part of the collection of the Musée provincial Félicien Rops in Namur, Belgium.\n\nThe work in Namur is 75 cm high and 48 cm wide, executed in gouache and watercolor paint heightened with pastel on paper. Reproductions of the work (soft-ground etchings, heliogravures and aquatints, sometimes colored) are also present in other museum collections, such as the LACMA, the National Museum of Western Art and the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam.\n\n\"Pornocrates\" is considered the best-known work by Rops. It was realized at a time when Rops was 45 years old and lived in Paris together with the sisters Léontine and Aurélie Duluc, who both were his mistresses and became mothers to his children. The title of the work can be translated as \"the ruler of fornication\". According to his own correspondence, Rops produced this painting \"in an overheated apartment, full of different smells, where the opopanax and cyclamen gave me a slight fever conductive towards production or even towards reproduction\". The work depicts a woman, holding a swine on a leash, viewed from the left side. The woman, said to be a courtesan, is almost naked, with the exception of long black silk gloves, a blindfold, a plumed hat, black shoes and stockings, and a band of gold and blue silk – accessories which only emphasize her nakedness. Above the pig with golden tail, three winged putti fly away in what looks like shock or horror. Rops refers to them as \"Three loves – ancient loves – vanish in tears\".\n\nVarious interpretations for the work exist. The woman can be seen as a powerful female, led by the hog, which can be seen as an image of man, in a bestial, submissive and ignorant state, kept in check by the woman. The pig with golden tail can also be seen as an allegory for luxury, or even as an animal of the devil, a symbol of fornication, steering the woman in blindness. In any case the work represents Rops' vision of the woman of his time: a \"femme fatale\" who was increasingly assertive, ruthless and seductive. \"She was the human animal viciously depicted by Félicien Rops as \"Pornokrates\", ruler of Proudhon's \"Pornocracy\", a creature blindly guided by a hog, the symbol of Circe, the bestial representative of all sexual evil\".\n\nThe woman and pig are walking on top of a marble stage, with a frieze depicting four allegories of the arts: sculpture, music, literature and painting. The fine arts are depicted as grey, classical male figures, looking desperate. This might be interpreted as the victory of sensuousness and eroticism of the art that Rops and his contemporaries of the Decadent movement created, in contrast with the boredom of the academic art of that era.\n\nThe title may also refer to the concept of pornocracy, a period in the History of the papacy during the first half of the 10th Century where the Popes were strongy influenced by a corrupt aristocratic family, the Theophylacti. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon published his anti-feminist tract \"La Pornocratie ou les femmes dans les temps modernes\" in 1875, three years before Rops worked on his \"Pornocrates\".\n\nAn early owner of the work was the Belgian jurist and art collector Edmond Picard. \"Pornocrates\" was received with indignation and scandal during the 1886 exhibition of the Cercle des XX, an art group to which Rops belonged.\n\n"}

Liberation theology is a school of theology within Christianity, particularly in the Catholic Church. It emphasizes the Christian mission to bring justice to the poor and oppressed, particularly through political activism.

It was first founded in 1926. Amateur theatre companies in Scotland have generally presented repertoire in English, Lowland Scots and, more occasionally, Scottish Gaelic. \n\nThe SCDA was founded during the period of the Scottish Renaissance, a time of increasing calls to revive many of the cultural and political institutions in Scotland which were perceived as moribund at this period, including native theatre. Serious professional theatre in Scotland had more or less lapsed by the 1880s and the first twentieth century attempt to revive it faltered with the demise of Alfred Wareing's short-lived Glasgow Repertory Theatre (founded in 1909) which closed down on the outbreak of World War I. Its remaining funds were used in the early 1920s to found the amateur Scottish National Players with the goal to promote native theatre. During the interwar years all such initiatives had their origins in the amateur theatre movement, in particular Glasgow's Curtain Theatre (1932–39) founded by Grace Ballantyne, Scottish People's Theatre and Glasgow Unity. \n\nNo teaching institutions offered formal provision for training in Scottish styles of performance or diction until the establishment of the Glasgow College of Dramatic Art in 1950 (as part of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music). as a consequence, most of Scotland's ground-breaking mid-twentieth century native actors, such as Duncan Macrae, Roddy McMillan or Molly Urquhart, first developed their skills and methods through performance with the more innovative non-professional companies listed above. Similarly, native playwrights who wished to present authentic representations of Scottish life on the stage, such as Joe Corrie, Robert McLellan, John Brandane, Ena Lamont Stewart and others, first came to attention generally through amateur productions of their plays. \n\nLowland Scots playwrights in particular were well served by non-professional theatre at a time when voicing for professional actors in Britain was dictated by received pronunciation. Miscasting in professional productions of McLellan's Scots plays was a regular complaint for the playwright, often in contrast to amateur productions of his Scots in which actors without formal training gave sympathetic and authentic delivery of the language. \n\nAfter James Bridie's establishment of the Citizens Theatre in 1942, Scotland finally began to develop a native professional theatre. \n\nAfter the introduction of television during the 1950s, the number of amateur companies in Scotland, in common with the situation elsewhere, began to decline from its peak in the 1940s, but it still remains a vigorous part of Scottish cultural life. \n\nThe SCDA has maintained a successful annual one-act drama festival since its inception, with one interregnum of five years (1940–45) during the Second World War.\n\n\n"}

The Simon Bauer collection included 93 works from the Impressionist movement. Since the liberation of France, some of the canvases have reappeared at auctions or exhibitions in museums.\n\nSimon Bauer was born in 1862 to a humble background. He made a fortune in the footwear business, selling his holdings at the age of 40, at which point he began to travel the world to make up for his lack of education.\n\nAccording to the inventory taken at the time of its appropriation on 10 October 1943, Bauer's art collection comprised more than 90 works that included eleven by Pissarro, four by Sisley, four by Boudin, and one each by Degas and Berthe Morisot. The sale was entrusted to a merchant designated by the General Commissariat for Jewish Affairs ().\n\nThe following year, in the summer of 1944, Bauer was interned at the Drancy internment camp but saved from deportation and likely death by a railway strike. He was released in September 1944 and tried to recover the paintings that had been stolen from him, but with little success. Some of them are kept in the Jeu de Paume museum in Paris, but most have disappeared.\n\nBauer died in 1947. His grandson, Jean-Jacques Bauer, has attempted to recover his grandfather's paintings.

It is transitional between the preceding Mycenaean pottery and the subsequent styles of Greek vase painting, especially the Protogeometric style. The vases date to between 1030 and 1000 BC. \n\nSubmycenaean pottery is not very well researched, as only few sites from the period have been discovered so far. The style was first recognised in 1939 by Wilhelm Kraiker and Karl Kübler, based on finds from the Kerameikos and Pompeion cemeteries in Athens and on Salamis. The existence of the style remained disputed among archaeologists until later discoveries in Mycenae clearly showed the existence of separate Late Mycenaean and Submycenaean strata. \n\nSubmycenaean pottery occurs primarily in contexts such as inhumations and stone-built cist graves. Find locations are widely distributed, suggesting a settlement pattern of hamlets and villages. Apart from the sites mentioned above, Submycenaean pottery is known from locations such as Corinth, Asine, Kalapodi, Lefkandi and Tiryns.\n\nThe quality of the vases varies widely. Only few shapes were produced, especially stirrup jars with a pierced shoulder, belly amphorae and neck amphorae, \"lekythoi\" as well as jars, some with trefoil-shaped mouths. By the end of the Submycenaean period, the stirrup jar was replaced by the \"lekythos\". Submycenaean decoration is rather simple, the hand-painted motifs are limited to horizontal or vertical wavy lines, single or double hatched and overlapping triangles, as well as single or multiple concentric semicircles. The shoulders of \"lekythoi\", amphorae and stirrup jars bore ornamental decoration. Amphorae, \"amphoriskoi\" and jugs were usually painted with one or several thick wavy lines. In general, the style was much shorter and less carefully made than the previous types of pottery.\n\n\n"}

It stars Michael Boatman and Lori Petty as rookie police officers who uncover a conspiracy around the arrest of a suspect (Ice Cube). After a festival run, it was released in the United States on June 2, 1995, and grossed $3.3 million.\n\nJohn \"J. J.\" Johnson is a rookie deputy sheriff in the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department. Because of his inexperience and race, he experiences tension with his white colleagues as their first black deputy. Although he initially clashes with Deputy Deborah Fields, the department's first female deputy, they strike up a friendship. While on patrol, Johnson backs up Deputy Bono when he stops a black man, Teddy Woods, at a gas station. When Bono runs Woods' drivers license, he finds a warrant for his arrest. Woods reveals he has a stolen pistol in his car, and the police officers arrest him.\n\nDeputy Fields is the second deputy to the scene of a murder, but Detectives Baker and Hall dismiss her observations. Mr. Greenspan says a black man murdered his wife in a botched robbery, and the detectives pressure Woods to confess after they trace his stolen pistol to the murder. Woods defiantly proclaims his innocence, frustrating his lawyer, James Locket, who advises him to show less attitude in court. At the same time, community activist Reverend Banks raises awareness of the death of a black prisoner whom he believes to have been murdered by the police while in custody. Johnson dismisses the concerns of his family and girlfriend, saying there is no evidence of this.\n\nWhile coaching Bono on what to say at the trial, Johnson's commander, Clarence Massey, learns that Bono stopped Woods because of his race. Frustrated, Massey instructs him to come up with a better excuse. Bono suggests a traffic violation and later requests that Johnson back him up. Johnson agrees, and Massey praises him for his loyalty and dependability while chastising Fields for her refusal to fit in better. At the trial, Locket points out holes in the police testimony, making Johnson wonder if he made the right decision. Fields joins Johnson in investigating what really happened. With help from a whistleblower, they discover numerous cover-ups that involve Baker, Hall, and Massey.\n\nAs the trial progresses and Greenspan's testimony proves problematic, Massey has Baker murder Greenspan to prevent him from becoming a liability. Hall, sick from cancer, dies at the station. Tensions rise as Johnson and Fields continue pursuing their own investigation, and they become further paranoid when Johnson insists they were intentionally given faulty intelligence during a drug raid. After Fields is hospitalized following an assault, Johnson and Baker come to blows. Massey breaks them up and temporarily places Johnson in a jail cell. When released, he delivers incriminating evidence to Locket that implicates Baker in various crimes, including the murder of the black prisoner and framing Woods.\n\nThe jury can not reach a verdict. Facing a widespread investigation of police corruption that goes to the city council and mayor's office, the district attorney offers to drop the charges against Woods. Locket, with the reluctant backing of a city councilman, instead pushes for a new trial, which the judge accepts. Bono turns state's evidence and testifies against Johnson, admitting that the two committed perjury. Caught up in the probe, Johnson pleads guilty and receives a suspended sentence. After the sheriff's department is disbanded, Massey retires, Baker is sentenced to four years and is in an honor prison while appealing. The unit is disbanded and the other officers including Bono are reassigned.\n\n\nThe budget was under $5 million.\n\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 64% of 22 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.6/10. Todd McCarthy of \"Variety\" called it a \"powerful moral drama\" that addresses too many complexes issues for one film. While commenting on how it presaged the O. J. Simpson murder trial, Caryn James of \"The New York Times\" called it smart and compelling. Peter Ranier of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote, \"It's a rigorous, angry piece of work, but it misses out on the psychological depths that have made Burnett's previous films among the glories of recent American independent moviemaking.\" Hal Hinson of \"The Washington Post\", in comparing it negatively to television cop dramas, described it as \"a topical but otherwise unremarkable police drama\". Michael Wilmington of the \"Chicago Tribune\" rated it 3/4 stars and wrote, \"It's unusual to see a police thriller told with this kind of care, subtlety, thoughtfulness and creativity.\"\n\nAt the 1994 Locarno International Film Festival, Charles Burnett was nominated for the Golden Leopard.\n\n"}

While working for Square, she was best known for her work on the soundtrack for \"Kingdom Hearts\", which was her last game for the company before leaving. Starting with \"\" in 2003, she began working as an active freelancer, starting up a music production company called Midiplex. Despite going freelance, she has continued to work on projects for Square Enix, including all of the titles in the \"Kingdom Hearts\" series, as well as for other games such as \"The 3rd Birthday\" and \"Final Fantasy XV\".\n\nHer works have gained a great deal of popularity, and have been performed in multiple video game music concerts, including one, \"Sinfonia Drammatica\", that was focused half on her \"greatest hits\" album, \"Drammatica: The Very Best of Yoko Shimomura\", and half on the music of a previous concert. Music from several of her games have been published as arranged albums, and as piano scores.\n\nShimomura was born on October 19, 1967, in Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan. She developed an interest for music at a young age, and started taking piano lessons \"at the age of four or five\". She began composing her own music by playing the piano randomly and pretending to compose, eventually coming up with her own pieces, the first of which she claims to still remember how to play. Shimomura attended Osaka College of Music, and graduated as a piano major in 1988.\n\nUpon graduation, Shimomura intended to become a piano instructor and was extended a job offer to become a piano teacher at a music store, but as she had been an avid gamer for many years she decided to send some samples of her work to various video game companies that were recruiting at the university. Capcom invited her in for an audition and interview, and she was offered a job there. Her family and instructors were dismayed with her change in focus, as video game music was not well respected, and \"they had paid [her] tuition for an expensive music school and couldn't understand why [she] would accept such a job\", but Shimomura accepted the job at Capcom anyway.\n\nWhile working for Capcom, Shimomura contributed to the soundtracks of over 16 games, including the successful \"\", which she composed all but three pieces for. The first soundtrack she worked on at the company was for \"Samurai Sword\" in 1988. \"Final Fight\", in 1989, was her first work to receive a separate soundtrack album release, on an album of music from several Capcom games. The first soundtrack album to exclusively feature her work came a year later for the soundtrack to \"Street Fighter II\". While she began her tenure at Capcom working on games for video game consoles, by 1990 she had moved to the arcade game division. She was a member of the company's in-house band Alph Lyla, which played various Capcom game music, including pieces written by Shimomura. She performed live with the group on a few occasions, including playing piano during Alph Lyla's appearance at the 1992 Game Music Festival.\n\nIn 1993, Shimomura left Capcom to join another game company, Square. She stated that the move was done because she was interested in writing \"classical-style\" music for fantasy role-playing games. While working for Capcom, she was in the arcade department and was unable to transfer to the console department to work on their role-playing video game series \"Breath of Fire\", although she did contribute one track to the first game in the series. Her first project at Square was the score for the role-playing video game \"Live A Live\" in 1994. While she was working on the score to \"Super Mario RPG\" the following year, she was asked to join Noriko Matsueda on the music to the futuristic strategy RPG \"Front Mission\". Although she was overworked doing both scores and it was not the genre that she was interested in, she found herself unable to refuse after her first attempt to do so unexpectedly happened in the presence of the president of Square, Tetsuo Mizuno. These games were followed by \"Tobal No. 1\", the last score she worked on with another composer for a decade.\n\nOver the next few years, she composed the soundtrack to several games, including \"Parasite Eve\" and \"Legend of Mana\". Of all her compositions, Shimomura considers the soundtrack to \"Legend of Mana\" the one that best expresses herself and the soundtrack remains Shimomura's personal favourite. \"Parasite Eve\" on the PlayStation had the first soundtrack by Shimomura that included a vocal song, as it was the first game she had written for running on a console system that had the sound capability for one. In 2002 she wrote the score for \"Kingdom Hearts\", which she has said is the most \"special\" soundtrack to her, as well as a turning point in her career; she named the soundtracks to \"Street Fighter II\" and \"Super Mario RPG\" as the other two significant points in her life as a composer.\n\n\"Kingdom Hearts\" was wildly successful, shipping more than four million copies worldwide; Shimomura's music was frequently cited as one of the highlights of the game, and the title track has been ranked as the fourth-best role-playing game title track of all time. The soundtrack has led to two albums of piano arrangements. \"Kingdom Hearts\" was the last soundtrack that she worked on at Square. After the release of \"Kingdom Hearts\" in 2002, Shimomura left Square for maternity leave, and began work as a freelancer in 2003. She has built on the work she did while at Square; since leaving she has composed or is composing music for eleven \"Kingdom Hearts\" games and Nintendo's \"Mario & Luigi\" series. She has also worked on many other projects, such as \"Heroes of Mana\" and various arranged albums. In February 2014, Shimomura played piano at a retrospective 25th anniversary concert at Tokyo FM Hall. She performed songs from games such as \"Kingdom Hearts\", \"Live a Live\", and \"Street Fighter II\". During the \"Beware the Forest's Mushrooms\" performance from \"Super Mario RPG\", Shimomura was joined onstage by fellow game composer Yasunori Mitsuda, who played the Irish bouzouki. She most recently composed and produced the majority of the score for \"Final Fantasy XV\", which she began writing for in 2006, a decade before the game was released.\n\nAfter composing soundtracks to over 45 different games, Shimomura has become one of the biggest names in video game music industry, and has been described as \"the most famous female video game music composer in the world\". Shimomura's best works compilation album, titled \"Drammatica: The Very Best of Yoko Shimomura\", was released in March 2008. The album contains compositions from \"Kingdom Hearts\" and many other games she worked on in full orchestration, with Shimomura stating that she chose music that was popular among fans and well-suited for orchestration, but had never been performed by an orchestra before. In a 2008 interview with Music4Games regarding the project, Shimomura commented that with the sheet music generated for the project, she would be interested in pursuing a live performance of \"Drammatica\" for fans if the opportunity arose. In March 2009, that wish was realized when it was announced that Arnie Roth would conduct the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra at the concert Sinfonia Drammatica in the Stockholm Concert Hall, which would combine music from the album with performances of Chris Hülsbeck's Symphonic Shades concert. The concert took place in August 2009. In March 2007, Shimomura released her first non-video game album, \"Murmur\", an album of vocal songs sung by Chata.\n\nShimomura's music for \"Kingdom Hearts\" made up one fourth of the music of the Symphonic Fantasies concerts in September 2009, which were produced by the creators of the Symphonic Game Music Concert series and conducted by Arnie Roth. \"Legend of Mana\"s title theme was also performed by the Australian Eminence Symphony Orchestra for its classical gaming music concert \"A Night in Fantasia 2007\".\n\nMusic from the original soundtrack of \"Legend of Mana\" was arranged for the piano and published by DOREMI Music Publishing. Two compilation books of music from the series have also been published as \"Seiken Densetsu Best Collection Piano Solo Sheet Music\" first and second editions, with the second including Shimomura's tracks from \"Legend of Mana\". All songs in each book have been rewritten by Asako Niwa as beginning to intermediate level piano solos, though they are meant to sound as much like the originals as possible. Additionally, piano sheet music from \"Kingdom Hearts\" and \"Kingdom Hearts II\" has been published as music books by Yamaha Music Media.\n\nShimomura's first dedicated concert performance outside Japan was held at the Salle Cortot in Paris in November 2015. Later that same month, she performed at the El Plaza Condesa in Mexico City. In September 2016, some of her music for \"Final Fantasy XV\" was performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London, as well as in Boston, with Shimomura herself performing on piano.\n\nShimomura lists Ludwig van Beethoven, Frédéric Chopin, and Maurice Ravel as some of her influences on her personal website. She has also stated that she has enjoyed \"lounge-style jazz\" for a long time. Despite these influences and her classical training, the diverse musical styles that she has used throughout her career and sometimes in the same soundtrack include \"rock, electronica, oriental, ambient, industrial, pop, symphonic, operatic, chiptune, and more\". She draws inspiration for her songs from things in her life that move her emotionally, which she describes as \"a beautiful picture, scenery, tasting something delicious, scents that bring back memories, happy and sad things... Anything that moves my emotion gives me inspiration\". Shimomura has also stated that she comes up with most of her songs when she is doing something that is \"not part of [her] daily routine, like traveling.\" Although her influences are mostly classical, she has said that in her opinion her \"style has changed dramatically over the years, though the passion for music stays the same.\" Shimomura has said that she believes that an important part of \"the creative process behind music\" is to \"convey a subtle message, something that comes from your imagination and sticks with the listener, without being overly specific about what it means\", rather than only writing simple themes with obvious messages. Her favorite track that she has ever composed is \"Dearly Beloved\" from \"Kingdom Hearts\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
