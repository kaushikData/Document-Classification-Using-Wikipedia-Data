{"id": "51812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51812", "title": "Amphora", "text": "Amphora\n\nAn amphora (; Greek: ἀμφορεύς, \"amphoréus\"; English plural: amphorae or amphoras) is a type of container of a characteristic shape and size, descending from at least as early as the Neolithic Period. Amphorae were used in vast numbers for the transport and storage of various products, both liquid and dry, but mostly for wine. They are most often ceramic, but examples in metals and other materials have been found. Versions of the amphorae were one of many shapes used in Ancient Greek vase painting. \n\nThe amphora complements the large storage container, the pithos, which makes available capacities between one-half and two and one-half tons. In contrast, the amphora holds under a half-ton, typically less than 50 kilograms (100 lbs). The bodies of the two types have similar shapes. Where the pithos may have multiple small loops or lugs for fastening a rope harness, the amphora has two expansive handles joining the shoulder of the body and a long neck. The necks of pithoi are wide for scooping or bucket access. The necks of amphorae are narrow for pouring by a person holding it by the bottom and a handle. Some variants exist. The handles might not be present. The size may require two or three handlers to lift. For the most part, however, an amphora was tableware, or sat close to the table, was intended to be seen, and was finely decorated as such by master painters.\n\nStoppers of perishable materials, which have rarely survived, were used to seal the contents. Two principal types of amphorae existed: the \"neck amphora\", in which the neck and body meet at a sharp angle; and the \"one-piece amphora\", in which the neck and body form a continuous curve. Neck amphorae were commonly used in the early history of ancient Greece, but were gradually replaced by the one-piece type from around the 7th century BC onward.\n\nMost were produced with a pointed base to allow upright storage by embedding in soft ground, such as sand. The base facilitated transport by ship, where the amphorae were packed upright or on their sides in as many as five staggered layers. If upright, the bases probably were held by some sort of rack, and ropes passed through their handles to prevent shifting or toppling during rough seas. Heather and reeds might be used as packing around the vases. Racks could be used in kitchens and shops. The base also concentrated deposits from liquids with suspended solid particles, such as olive oil and wines.\n\nAmphorae are of great use to maritime archaeologists, as they often indicate the age of a shipwreck and the geographic origin of the cargo. They are occasionally so well preserved that the original content is still present, providing information on foodstuffs and mercantile systems. Amphorae were too cheap and plentiful to return to their origin-point and so, when empty, they were broken up at their destination. At a breakage site in Rome, Testaccio, close to the Tiber, the fragments, later wetted with Calcium hydroxide (Calce viva), remained to create a hill now named Monte Testaccio, high and more than 1 kilometre in circumference.\n\nAmphora is a Greco-Roman word developed in ancient Greek during the Bronze Age. The Romans acquired it during the Hellenization that occurred in the Roman Republic. Cato is the first known literary person to use it. The Romans turned the Greek form into a standard -a declension noun, \"amphora\", pl. \"amphorae\". Undoubtedly, the word and the vase were introduced to Italy through the Greek settlements there, which traded extensively in Greek pottery.\n\nIt is remarkable that even though the Etruscans imported, manufactured, and exported amphorae extensively in their wine industry, and other Greek vase names were Etruscanized, no Etruscan form of the word exists. There was perhaps an as yet unidentified native Etruscan word for the vase that pre-empted the adoption of \"amphora\".\nThe Latin word derived from the Greek \"amphoreus\" (), a shortened form of \"amphiphoreus\" (), a compound word combining \"amphi-\" (\"on both sides\", \"twain\") and \"phoreus\" (\"carrier\"), from \"pherein\" (\"to carry\"), referring to the vessel's two carrying handles on opposite sides. The amphora appears as , \"a-pi-po-re-we\", in the Linear B Bronze Age records of Knossos, , \"a-po-re-we\", at Mycenae, and the fragmentary \"]-re-we\" at Pylos, designated by , Bennett's AMPHORA, which has a number of scribal variants. The two spellings are transcriptions of amphiphorēwes (plural) and amphorēwe (dual) in Mycenaean Greek from which it may be seen that the short form prevailed on the mainland. Homer uses the long form for metrical reasons, and Herodotus has the short form. Ventris and Chadwick's translation is \"carried on both sides.\"\n\nAmphorae varied greatly in height. The largest stands as tall as 1.5 metres (5 ft) high, while some were less than 30 centimetres (12 in) high - the smallest were called amphoriskoi (literally \"little amphorae\"). Most were around 45 centimetres (18 in) high.\n\nThere was a significant degree of standardisation in some variants; the wine amphora held a standard measure of about 39 litres (41 US qt), giving rise to the amphora quadrantal as a unit of measure in the Roman Empire. In all, approximately 66 distinct types of amphora have been identified.\n\nFurther, the term also stands for an ancient Roman unit of measurement for liquids. The volume of a Roman amphora was one cubic foot, c. 26.026 L.\n\nRoman amphorae were wheel-thrown terracotta containers. During the production process the body was made first and then left to dry partially. Then coils of clay were added to form the neck, the rim, and the handles. Once the amphora was complete, the maker then treated the interior with resin that would prevent permeation of stored liquids. The reconstruction of these stages of production is based primarily on the study of modern amphora production in some areas of the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nAmphorae often were marked with a variety of stamps, sgraffito, and inscriptions. They provided information on the production, content, and subsequent marketing. A stamp usually was applied to the amphora at a partially dry stage. It indicates the name of the \"figlina\" (workshop) and/or the name of the owner of the workshop. Painted stamps, \"tituli picti\", recorded the weight of the container and the contents, and were applied after the amphora was filled.\n\nThe first systematic classification of Roman amphorae types was undertaken by the German scholar Heinrich Dressel. Following the exceptional amphora deposit uncovered in Rome in Castro Pretorio at the end of the 1800s, he collected almost 200 inscriptions from amphorae and included them in the \"Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum\". In his studies of the amphora deposit he was the first to elaborate a classification of types, the so-called \"Dressel table\", which still is used today for many types.\n\nSubsequent studies on Roman amphorae have produced more detailed classifications, which usually are named after the scholar who studied them. For the neo-Phoenician types see the work by Maña published in 1951, and the revised classification by van der Werff in 1977-1978. The Gallic amphorae have been studied by Laubenheimer in a study published in 1989, whereas the Cretan amphorae have been analyzed by Marangou-Lerat. Beltràn studied the Spanish types in 1970. Adriatic types have been studied by Lamboglia in 1955. For a general analysis of the Western Mediterranean types see Panella, and Peacock and Williams.\n\nCeramics of shapes and uses falling within the range of amphorae, with or without handles, are of prehistoric heritage across Eurasia, from the Caucasus to China. For example, the kvevri, common in the Republic of Georgia and the Caucasus, may be traced back to approximately 6000 BC. Amphorae dated to approximately 4800 BC have been found in Banpo, a Neolithic site of the Yangshao culture in China. Amphorae first appeared on the Phoenician coast at approximately 3500 BC.\n\nIn the Bronze and Iron Ages amphorae spread around the ancient Mediterranean world, being used by the ancient Greeks and Romans as the principal means for transporting and storing grapes, olive oil, wine, oil, olives, grain, fish, and other commodities. They were produced on an industrial scale until approximately the 7th century AD. Wooden and skin containers seem to have supplanted amphorae thereafter.\n\nThey influenced Chinese ceramics and other East Asian ceramic cultures, especially as a fancy shape for high-quality decorative ceramics, and continued to be produced there long after they had ceased to be used further west.\n\nBesides coarse amphorae used for storage and transport, the vast majority, high-quality painted amphorae were produced in Ancient Greece in significant numbers for a variety of social and ceremonial purposes. Their design differs vastly from the more functional versions; they are typified by wide mouth and a ring base, with a glazed surface and decorated with figures or geometric shapes. They normally have a firm base on which they can stand. amphorae were used as prizes in the Panathenaic Festivals held between the 6th century BC to the 2nd century BC, filled with olive oil from a sacred grove. Surviving examples bear the inscription \"I am one of the prizes from Athens\", and usually depict the particular event they were awarded for. \n\nPainted amphorae were also used for funerary purposes, often in special types such as the \"loutrophoros\". Especially in earlier periods, outsize vases were used as grave markers, while some amphorae were used as containers for the ashes of the dead. By the Roman period vase-painting had largely died out, and utilitarian amphorae were normally the only type produced.\n\nVarious different types of amphorae were popular at different times:\n\nOn a neck amphora, the handles are attached to the neck, which is separated from the belly by an angular carination. There are two main types of neck amphorae:\nThere are also some rarer special types of neck amphora, distinguished by specific features, for example:\n\nIn contrast to the neck amphora, a belly amphora does not have a distinguished neck; instead the belly reaches the mouth in a continuous curve. After the mid-5th century BC, this type was rarely produced. The \"pelike\" is a special type of belly amphora, with the belly placed lower, so that the widest point of the vessel is near its bottom. The \"pelike\" was introduced around the end of the 6th century BC.\n\nAnother special type is the Panathenaic prize amphora, with black-figure decoration, produced exclusively as prize vessels for the Panathenaia and retaining the black-figure technique for centuries after the introduction of red-figure vase painting. Some examples bear the inscription \"ΤΩΝ ΑΘΗΝΗΘΕΝ ΑΘΛΩΝ\" meaning \"[I am one] of the prizes from [the goddess] Athena\". They contained the prize of oil from the sacred olive tree of the goddess Athena for the winners of the athletic contests held to honour the goddess, and were evidently kept thereafter, and perhaps used to store wine, before being buried with the prize-winner. They depicted goddess Athena on one side (as seen on the second image on this page) and the athletic event on the other side, e.g. a scene of wrestling or running contest etc.\nBy the Roman period utilitarian amphorae were normally the only type produced.\n\nThe first type of Roman amphora, Dressel 1, appears in central Italy in the late 2nd century BC. This type had thick walls and a characteristic red fabric. It was very heavy, although also strong. Around the middle of the 1st century BC the so-called Dressel 2-4 starts to become widely used. This type of amphora presented some advantages in being lighter and with thinner walls. It has been calculated that while a ship could accommodate approximately 4500 Dressel 1, it was possible to fit 6000 Dressel 2-4 in the same space.</ref> Dressel 2-4 were often produced in the same workshops used for the production of Dressel 1 which quickly ceased to be used.\n\nAt the same time in Cuma (southern Italy) the production of the \"cadii cumani\" type starts (Dressel 21-22). These containers were mainly used for the transportation of fruit and were used until the middle imperial times. At the same time, in central Italy, the so-called Spello amphorae, small containers, were produced for the transportation of wine. On the Adriatic coast the older types were replaced by the Lamboglia 2 type, a wine amphora commonly produced between the end of the 2nd and the 1st century BC. This type develops later into the Dressel 6A which becomes dominant during Augustan times.\n\nIn the Gallic provinces the first examples of Roman amphorae were local imitations of pre-existent types such as Dressel 1, Dressel 2-4, Pascual 1, and Haltern 70. The more typical Gallic production begins within the ceramic ateliers in Marseille during late Augustan times. The type Oberaden 74 was produced to such an extent that it influenced the production of some Italic types. Spanish amphorae became particularly popular thanks to a flourishing production phase in late Republican times. The \"Hispania Baetica\" and \"Hispania Tarraconensis\" regions (south-western and eastern Spain) were the main production areas between the 2nd and the 1st century BC due to the distribution of land to military veterans and the founding of new colonies. Spanish amphorae were widespread in the Mediterranean area during early imperial times. The most common types were all produced in Baetica and among these there were the Dressel 20, a typical olive oil container, the Dressel 7-13, for garum (fish sauce), and the Haltern 70, for defrutum (fruit sauce). In the Tarraconensis region the Pascual 1 was the most common type, a wine amphora shaped on the Dressel 1, and imitations of Dressel 2-4.\n\nNorth-African production was based on an ancient tradition which may be traced back to the Phoenician colony of Carthage. Phoenician amphorae had characteristic small handles attached directly onto the upper body. This feature becomes the distinctive mark of late-Republican/early imperial productions, which are then called neo-Phoenician. The types produced in Tripolitania and Northern Tunisia are the Maña C1 and C2, later renamed van Der Werff 1, 2, and 3. In the Aegean area the types from the island of Rhodes were quite popular starting from the 3rd century BC due to local wine production which flourished over a long period. These types developed into the \"Camulodunum\" 184, an amphora used for the transportation of Rhodian wine all over the empire. Imitations of the Dressel 2-4 were produced on the island of Cos for the transportation of wine from the 4th century BC until middle imperial times. Cretan containers also were popular for the transportation of wine and can be found around the Mediterranean from Augustan times until the 3rd century AD. During the late empire period, north-African types dominated amphora production. The so-called African I and II types were widely used from the 2nd until the late 4th century AD. Other types from the eastern Mediterranean (Gaza), such as the so-called Late Roman 4, became very popular between the 4th and the 7th century AD, while Italic productions ceased.\n\nSome modern winemakers and brewers are using amphoras to provide a different palate and tastes to their products than are available with other aging methods.\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}
{"id": "1937861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937861", "title": "Anagnorisis", "text": "Anagnorisis\n\nAnagnorisis (; ) is a moment in a play or other work when a character makes a critical discovery. Anagnorisis originally meant recognition in its Greek context, not only of a person but also of what that person stood for. Anagnorisis was the hero's sudden awareness of a real situation, the realisation of things as they stood, and finally, the hero's insight into a relationship with an often antagonistic character in Aristotelian tragedy.\n\nIn his \"Poetics\", as part of his discussion of peripeteia, Aristotle defined anagnorisis as \"a change from ignorance to knowledge, producing love or hate between the persons destined by the poet for good or bad fortune\" (1452a). It is often discussed along with Aristotle's concept of catharsis.\nIn the Aristotelian definition of tragedy, it was the discovery of one's own identity or true character (e.g. Cordelia, Edgar, Edmund, etc. in Shakespeare's \"King Lear\") or of someone else's identity or true nature (e.g. Lear's children, Gloucester's children) by the tragic hero. \n\nAristotle was the first writer to discuss the uses of anagnorisis, with peripeteia caused by it. He considered it the mark of a superior tragedy, as when Oedipus killed his father and married his mother in ignorance, and later learned the truth, or when Iphigeneia in Tauris realizes in time that the strangers she is to sacrifice are her brother and his friend, and refrains from sacrificing them. Aristotle considered these complex plots superior to simple plots without anagnorisis or peripeteia, such as when Medea resolves to kill her children, knowing they are her children, and does so.\n\nAnother prominent example of anagnorisis in tragedy is in Aeschylus's \"The Choephoroi\" (\"Libation Bearers\") when Electra recognizes her brother, Orestes, after he has returned to Argos from his exile, at the grave of their father, Agamemnon, who had been murdered at the hands of Clytemnestra, their mother. Electra convinces herself that Orestes is her brother with three pieces of evidence: a lock of Orestes's hair on the grave, his footprints next to the grave, and a piece of weaving which she embroidered herself. The footprints and the hair are identical to her own. Electra's awareness is of her brother's presence, who is the one person who can help her by avenging the death of their father.\n\nThe section of Aristotle's \"Poetics\" dealing with comedy did not survive, but many critics also discuss recognition in comedies. A standard plot of the New Comedy was the final revelation, by birth tokens, that the heroine was of respectable birth and so suitable for the hero to marry. This was often brought about by the machinations of the tricky slave. This plot appears in Shakespeare's \"The Winter's Tale\", where a recognition scene in the final act reveals that Perdita is a king's daughter rather than a shepherdess, and so suitable for her prince lover.\n\nThe earliest use of anagnorisis in a murder mystery was in \"The Three Apples\", a classical \"Arabian Nights\" tale, where the device is employed to great effect in its twist ending. The protagonist of the story, Ja'far ibn Yahya, is ordered by Harun al-Rashid to find the culprit behind a murder mystery within three days or else be executed. It is only after the deadline has passed, and as he prepares to be executed, that he discovers that the culprit was his own slave all along.\n\nAnagnorisis, however, is not limited to classical or Elizabethan sources. Author and lecturer Ivan Pintor Iranzo points out that contemporary \"auteur\" M. Night Shyamalan uses similar revelations in \"The Sixth Sense\", in which child psychologist Malcolm Crowe successfully treats a child who is having visions of dead people, only to realize at the close of the film that Crowe himself is dead, as well as in \"Unbreakable\", in which the character of David realizes that he survived a train crash that killed the other passengers, due to a supernatural power. Another well known example of anagnorisis from popular culture is the revelation that Darth Vader is the father of Luke Skywalker in \"The Empire Strikes Back\". An extensive account of the history and application of anagnorisis is provided by Terence Cave in his book \"Recognitions\".\n\nA humorous definition is included in 'The Banner: mock-heroic verse epic, Part 1: Sid' by Robin Gordon:\n\nIn any moment of such crisis / \none thinks, of course, of those devices / \nwhich Aristotle said were needed / \nin any poem. We have heeded / \nAristotle, and our plot, / \n(beginning, middle, end), has got / \ncomplications too, and error / \nfit to rouse cathartic terror, / \nprotagonists, antagonists, / \nperipiteia, turns and twists. / \nThe poet's comments form the choruses, / \nbut now it's time for anagnorisis. / \nWhen Oedipus sees the bird he's bedded / \nis his own father's lawful wedded / \nwife, in fact she is his mother, / \nor Iphigenia finds her brother, / \nDiscovery or Recognition / \nbrings the plot to its fruition.\n"}
{"id": "334825", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=334825", "title": "Ancient art", "text": "Ancient art\n\nAncient art refers to the many types of art produced by the advanced cultures of ancient societies with some form of writing, such as those of ancient China, India, Mesopotamia, Persia, Palestine, Egypt, Greece, and Rome. The art of pre-literate societies is normally referred to as Prehistoric art and is not covered here. Although some Pre-Columbian cultures developed writing during the centuries before the arrival of Europeans, on grounds of dating these are covered at Pre-Columbian art, and articles such as Maya art and Aztec art. Olmec art is mentioned below.\n\nDue to the highly religious nature of ancient Ancient Egyptian civilization, many of the great works of ancient Egypt depict gods, goddesses, and Pharaohs, who were also considered divine. Ancient Egyptian art is characterized by the idea of order. Clear and simple lines combined with simple shapes and flat areas of color helped to create a sense of order and balance in the art of ancient Egypt. Ancient Egyptian artists used vertical and horizontal reference lines to maintain the correct proportions in their work. Political and religious, as well as artistic, order was also maintained in Egyptian art. To clearly define the social hierarchy of a situation, figures were drawn to sizes that were based not on their distance from the painter's perspective but on relative importance. For instance, the Pharaoh would be drawn as the largest figure in a painting no matter where he was situated, and a greater God would be drawn larger than a lesser god.\n\nSymbolism also played an important role in establishing a sense of order. Symbolism, ranging from the Pharaoh's regalia (symbolizing his power to maintain order) to the individual symbols of Egyptian gods and goddesses, was omnipresent in Egyptian art. Animals were usually also highly symbolic figures in Egyptian art. Color, as well, had extended meaning—blue and green represented the Nile and life; yellow stood for the sun god; and red represented power and vitality. The colors in Egyptian artifacts have survived extremely well over the centuries because of Egypt's dry climate.\n\nDespite the stilted form caused by a lack of perspective, ancient Egyptian art is often highly realistic. Ancient Egyptian artists often show a sophisticated knowledge of anatomy and a close attention to detail, especially in their renderings of animals.\nDuring the 18th Dynasty of Egypt a Pharaoh by the name of Akhenaton took the throne and abolished the traditional polytheism. He formed a monotheistic religion based on the worship of Aten, a sun god. Artistic change followed political upheaval. A new style of art was introduced that was more naturalistic than the stylized frieze favored in Egyptian art for the previous 1700 years. After Akhenaton's death, however, Egyptian artists reverted to their old styles.\n\nFaience that was produced in ancient Egyptian antiquity as early as 3500 BC was in fact superior to the tin-glazed earthenware of the European 15th century. Ancient Egyptian faience was not made of clay but instead actually of a ceramic composed primarily of quartz.\n\nMesopotamia (from the Greek Μεσοποταμία \"[land] between the rivers\", in Syriac called ܒܝܬ ܢܗܪܝܢ pronounced \"Beth Nahrain\", \"Land of rivers\", rendered in Arabic as بلاد الرافدين bilād al-rāfidayn) is a toponym for the area of the Tigris-Euphrates river system, largely corresponding to modern-day Iraq, as well as some parts of northeastern Syria, southeastern Turkey, and southwestern Iran. Mesopotamia is often considered the \"cradle of civilization.\" Within its boundaries, some of the most ancient civilizations known first developed writing and agriculture. Many civilizations flourished there, leaving behind a rich legacy of ancient art.\n\nWidely considered to be the cradle of civilization, Bronze Age Mesopotamia included Sumer and the Akkadian, Babylonian and Assyrian empires. In the Iron Age, it was ruled by the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian empires. The indigenous Sumerians and Akkadians (including Assyrians & Babylonians) dominated Mesopotamia from the beginning of written history (c. 3100 BC) to the fall of Babylon in 539 BC, when it was conquered by the Achaemenid Empire. It fell to Alexander the Great in 332 BC and after his death it became part of the Greek Seleucid Empire.\n\nAround 150 BC, Mesopotamia was under the control of the Parthians. Mesopotamia became a battleground between the Romans and Parthians, with parts of Mesopotamia (particularly Assyria) coming under periodic Roman control. In 226 AD, it fell to the Sassanid Persians, and remained under Persian rule until the 7th-century Arab Islamic conquest of the Sassanid Empire. A number of primarily Christian native Mesopotamian states existed between the 1st century BC and 3rd century AD, including Adiabene, Oshroene and Hatra. \nEtymology:\nThe regional toponym Mesopotamia (from the root words \"meso\" < μέσος = middle and \"potamia\" < ποταμός = river, literally \"between rivers\") was coined in the Hellenistic period to refer to a broad geographical area without definite boundaries, and was probably used by the Seleucids. The term biritum/birit narim corresponded to a similar geographical concept and was coined during the Aramaicization of the region, in the 10th century BC.\n\nIt is widely accepted, however, that early Mesopotamian societies simply referred to the entire alluvium by the Sumerian term kalam (\"land\"). More recently, terms like \"Greater Mesopotamia\" or \"Syro-Mesopotamia\" have been adopted to refer to wider geographies corresponding to the Near East or Middle East. These later euphemisms are Eurocentric terms attributed to the region in the midst of various 19th-century Western encroachments.\n\nArchaeological evidence attests to their existence during the 5th millennium BC. The Sumerians decorated their pottery with cedar oil paints. The Sumerians also developed jewelry.\n\nOne of the most remarkable artifacts remaining from the Sumerian civilization is known as the \"Standard of Ur\". Dated to approximately 2500 B.C., the Standard is a wooden box inlaid with shells and lapis lazuli. It depicts, on one side, soldiers presenting their king with prisoners and, on the other side, peasants presenting him with gifts—stunning evidence that attests to the vibrancy of art in this ancient culture. Sumer had made many great advances; for example, there is the wheel, which had made transportation easier for the Sumerians. The arch was the greatest architectural achievement of Sumer. The ziggurats were pyramid-shaped temples the Sumerian architects built. They believed that the gods lived at the tops of the temples. The kings would declare that the gods had sent them to rule, and the Sumerians would happily follow the king's laws. The king had many important jobs like leading the army and looking after irrigation, with which Sumerians could control rivers. The rulers would have battles over land, and life went on for the Sumerians.\n\nThe conquest of Sumer and Akkad by Babylon marks a turning point in the artistic as well as political history of the region.\n\nThe Babylonians took advantage of the abundance of clay in Mesopotamia to create bricks. The use of brick led to the early development of the pilaster and column, as well as of frescoes and enameled tiles. The walls were brilliantly coloured, and sometimes plated with bronze or gold as well as with tiles. Painted terra-cotta cones were also embedded in the plaster.\n\nThe sean were also great metal-workers, creating functional and beautiful tools with copper. It is possible that Babylonia was the original home of copper-working, which spread westward with the civilization to which it belonged. In addition, the want of stone in Babylonia made every pebble precious and led to a high perfection in the art of gem-cutting. The arts of Babylon also included tapestries, and Babylonian civilization was from an early date famous for its embroideries and rugs.\n\nLike all other kingdoms, the Babylonian kingdom did not last forever. When Babylon fell into decline it was eventually conquered by Assyria, one of its former colonies, Assyria inherited its arts as well as its empire.\n\nAt first, Assyrian architects and artists copied Babylonian styles and materials, but as time went by, however, the later Assyrians began to shake themselves free of Babylonian influences. The walls of the Assyrian palaces were lined with slabs of stone instead of brick, and were colored instead of painted as in Chaldea. In place of the bas relief we have sculpted figures, the earliest examples being the statues from Girsu which are realistic but somewhat clumsy.\n\nNo remarkable specimens of metallurgic art from early Assyria have been found, but at a later epoch great excellence was attained in the manufacture of such jewellery as ear-rings and bracelets of gold. Copper was also worked with skill.\n\nThe forms of Assyrian pottery were graceful; the porcelain, like the glass discovered in the palaces of Nineveh, was derived from Egyptian originals. Transparent glass seems to have been first introduced in the reign of Sargon II. Stone as well as clay and glass were employed in the manufacture of vases. Vases of hard stone have been disinterred at Tello similar to those of the early dynastic period of Egypt.\n\nAshurbanipal had promoted art and culture and had a vast library of cuneiform tablets at Nineveh.\n\nThe greatest civilization of the Bronze Age was that of the Minoans, a mercantilist people who built a trading empire from their homeland of Crete and from other Aegean islands. Minoan civilization was known for its beautiful ceramics, but also for its frescos, landscapes, and stone carvings. In the early Minoan period, ceramics were characterized by spirals, triangles, curved lines, crosses, and fishbone motifs. In the middle Minoan period, naturalistic designs such as fish, squid, birds, and lilies were common. In the late Minoan period, flowers and animals were still the most characteristic, but variability had increased. The 'palace style' of the region around Knossos is characterized by strong geometric simplification of naturalistic shapes and by monochromatic painting. The Palace at Knossos was decorated with frescoes that showed aspects of daily life, including court ritual and entertainment such as bull-leaping and boxing. The Minoans were also skilled goldsmiths who created beautiful pendants and masks.\n\nMycenaean art is close to the Minoan and includes many splendid finds from the royal graves, most famously the Mask of Agamemnon, a gold funeral mask. As may be seen from this item, the Mycenaeans specialized in gold-working. Their artworks are known for a plethora of decorative motifs employed. At some point in their cultural history, the Mycenaeans adopted the Minoan goddesses and associated these goddesses with their sky-god; scholars believe that the Greek pantheon of deities does not reflect Mycenaean religion except for the goddesses and Zeus. These goddesses, however, are Minoan in origin.\n\nAncient Greek art includes much pottery, sculpture as well as architecture. Greek sculpture is known for the contrapposto standing of the figures. The art of Ancient Greece is usually divided stylistically into three periods: the Archaic, the Classical and the Hellenistic. The history of Ancient Greek pottery is divided stylistically into periods: the Protogeometric, the Geometric, the Late Geometric or Archaic, the Black Figure and the Red Figure. Ancient Greek art has survived most successfully in the forms of sculpture and architecture, as well as in such minor arts as coin design, pottery and gem engraving.\n\nThe most prestigious form of Ancient Greek painting was panel painting, now known only from literary descriptions; they perished rapidly after the 4th century AD, when they were no longer actively protected. Today not much survives of Greek painting, except for late mummy paintings and a few paintings on the walls of tombs, mostly in Macedonia and Italy. Painting on pottery, of which a great deal survives, gives some sense of the aesthetics of Greek painting. The techniques involved, however, were very different from those used in large-format painting. It was mainly in black and gold and was painted using different paints than the ones used on walls or wood, because it was a different surface.\n\nThe first sculptures in India date back to the Indus Valley civilization some 5,000 years ago, where small stone carvings and bronze castings have been discovered. Later, as Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism developed further, India produced some of the most intricate bronzes in the world, as well as unrivaled temple carvings, some in huge shrines, such as the one at Ellora.\n\nThe Ajanta Caves in Maharashtra, India are rock-cut cave monuments dating back to the second century BCE and containing paintings and sculpture considered to be masterpieces of both Buddhist religious art and universal pictorial art.\n\nIran succeeded to the Hittite Empire and initially took much of its artistic styles from them. Huge palaces in rural settings, often worked on by craftsmen drawn from other nations, subject or not, were distinctive features. After the Empire was decisively overthrown by Alexander the Great a new Sassanian culture emerged, notable for palaces and metalwork. The capitals Susa, Persepolis, Ecbatana and Estakhr have revealed much rich Persian art.\n\nIt is commonly said that Roman art was derivative from Greek and Etruscan art. Indeed, the villas of the wealthy Romans unearthed in Pompeii and Herculaneum show a strong predilection for all things Greek. Many of the most significant Greek artworks survive by virtue of their Roman interpretation and imitation. Roman artists sought to commemorate great events in the life of their state and to glorify their emperors as well as record the inner life of people, and express ideas of beauty and nobility. Their busts, and especially the images of individuals on gravestones, are very expressive and lifelike, finished with skill and panache.\n\nIn Greece and Rome, wall painting was not considered as high art. The most prestigious form of art besides sculpture was panel painting, i.e. tempera or encaustic painting on wooden panels. Unfortunately, since wood is a perishable material, only a very few examples of such paintings have survived, namely the Severan Tondo from circa 200 AD, a very routine official portrait from some provincial government office, and the well-known Fayum mummy portraits, all from Roman Egypt, and almost certainly not of the highest contemporary quality. The portraits were attached to burial mummies at the face, from which almost all have now been detached. They usually depict a single person, showing the head, or head and upper chest, viewed frontally. The background is always monochrome, sometimes with decorative elements. In terms of artistic tradition, the images clearly derive more from Greco-Roman traditions than Egyptian ones. They are remarkably realistic, though variable in artistic quality, and may indicate the similar art which was widespread elsewhere but did not survive. A few portraits painted on glass and medals from the later empire have survived, as have coin portraits, some of which are considered very realistic as well. Pliny the Younger complained of the declining state of Roman portrait art, \"The painting of portraits which used to transmit through the ages the accurate likenesses of people, has entirely gone out…Indolence has destroyed the arts.\"\n\nThe eras of Japanese art correspond to the locations of various governments. The earliest known Japanese artifacts are attributable to the Aniu tribe, who influenced the Jōmon people, and these eras came to be known as the Jōmon and Yayoi time periods. Before the Yayoi invaded Japan, Jimmu in 660 B.C. was the crowned emperor. Later came the Haniwa of the Kofun era, then the Asuka when Buddhism reached Japan from China. The religion influenced Japanese art significantly for centuries thereafter.\n\nPrehistoric artwork such as painted pottery in Neolithic China can be traced back to the Yangshao culture and Longshan culture of the Yellow River valley. During China's Bronze Age, Chinese of the ancient Shang Dynasty and Zhou Dynasty produced multitudes of artistic bronzeware vessels for practical purposes, but also for religious ritual and geomancy. The earliest (surviving) Chinese paintings date to the Warring States period, and they were on silk as well as lacquerwares.\nOne of ancient China's most famous artistic relics remains the Terracotta warriors, an assembly of 8,099 individual and life-size terracotta figures (such as infantry, horses with chariots and cavalry, archers, and military officers), buried in the tomb of Qin Shi Huang, the First Qin Emperor, in 210 BC. This tradition was carried into the subsequent Han Dynasty, although their tombs contained miniature versions of the soldiers in addition to domestic servants to serve rulers and nobility in the afterlife. Chinese art arguably shows more continuity between ancient and modern periods than that of any other civilization, as even when foreign dynasties took the Imperial throne they did not impose new cultural or religious habits and were relatively quickly assimilated.\n\nThe ancient Olmec \"Bird Vessel\" and bowl, both ceramic and dating to circa 1000 BC as well as other ceramics are produced in kilns capable of exceeding approximately 900 °C. The only other prehistoric culture known to have achieved such high temperatures is that of Ancient Egypt.\n\nMuch Olmec art is highly stylized and uses an iconography reflective of the religious meaning of the artworks. Some Olmec art, however, is surprisingly naturalistic, displaying an accuracy of depiction of human anatomy perhaps equaled in the pre-Columbian New World only by the best Maya Classic era art. Olmec art-forms emphasize monumental statuary and small jade carvings. A common theme is to be found in representations of a divine jaguar. Olmec figurines were also found abundantly through their period.\n\nSources\n\n]\n"}

April is introduced as the sister of established character Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson).\n\nApril arrives in Albert Square in December 1995 to invite Carol and her boyfriend Alan (Howard Antony) to her wedding. April had been living and working in Greece for eight years selling time-share apartments, where she met and got engaged to a native named Nikos. Carol initially refuses the invitation as she knows that her black boyfriend will not be well received by her racist father, Jim Branning (John Bardon). However, Alan decides that he wants to go so April enlists her niece Sonia (Natalie Cassidy) as bridesmaid.\n\nThe ceremony is due to take place in April 1996 but just at the last minute the groom's best man turns up with the news that Nikos has fled back to Greece, leaving April distraught and humiliated. The day isn't a complete waste though as Alan and Carol get married in their place.\n\nApril returns to Walford in July to visit her sister, and after meeting the market inspector Michael Rose (Russell Floyd), to whom she is attracted to, she decides to stay. She gets herself a job working in Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth)'s café, where she is witness to her brother-in-law's flirtations with the vindictive Frankie Pierre (Syan Blake). When it becomes obvious that Frankie is involved with Alan, April informs Carol, which eventually leads to the end of Alan and Carol's relationship.\n\nApril and Michael's relationship continues over the next few months and eventually Michael falls in love and begs April to move in with him. April is unsure whether she wants to take such a big step, and while she is considering what to do, her ex, Nikos, shows up and tries to worm his way back into her affections. He demands to marry her and despite the fact that he had previously jilted her at the altar, April decides to give him another chance. She leaves Walford with him and manages to get him down the aisle, leaving Michael to marshal his stalls and mull over what might have been.\n\nApril's last appearance is in October 1996. Eleven years later it is revealed that April is still living in Greece, and is unable to attend her nephew Bradley (Charlie Clements)'s wedding to Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner). Following Jim's death in 2015, April's brother Max Branning (Jake Wood) declared during his eulogy that his sisters hated Jim so much they did not make any effort to attend his funeral.\n\nThe character of April Branning, played by Debbie Arnold, is introduced in December 1995 as the \"fun-loving\" sister of Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson). Her entrance storyline is part of a plot that leads to the marriage of Carol and her boyfriend Alan (Howard Antony) - when April is jilted at the altar, Carol and Alan marry in her place. The character was turned into a regular in 1996, moving to the soap's setting of Albert Square.\n\nAt the time, Jaci Stephen, television critic for \"The Mirror\" described April as a kind of character \"who, from the moment they open their mouths, appear to have been around for ever.\" She added, \"She has bleached blonde hair, overdresses and has the kind of flirtatious manner guaranteed to drive the Square's women to violence. As April grows more glamorous Cindy (Michelle Collins) grows more dowdy.\"\n\nApril's most high-profile storyline is a romance with market inspector Michael Rose (Russell Floyd). In August 1996, less than a year after her arrival, it was announced that actress Debbie Arnold was quitting her role as April Branning, despite previously being quoted as saying \"If they try to get rid of me, I'll chain myself to the railings of Albert Square.\" Arnold reportedly said, \"I want to move on\" and a friend of hers is quoted as saying \" Debbie has already appeared in \"Coronation Street\" and \"Emmerdale\". She's terrified of getting in a rut and wants to try her hand at other TV work - she's had plenty of offers already.\"\n\nIt was reported at the time that April's leaving storyline would revolve around an affair with her sister's husband Alan Jackson. According to \"The Mirror\", \"the show's bosses are planning a sensational storyline for her departure - April will start a steamy affair with her screen sister's husband Alan, played by Howard Anthony. But his missus finds out and viewers will be treated to an emotional confrontation between the two. April ends up packing her bags and leaving the Square because she still holds a torch for her brother-in-law.\" This proved to be false, and April instead departed after dumping Michael Rose and reuniting with her former lover to start a new life in Greece. She last appeared in October 1996.\n\nActress Debbie Arnold was reportedly popular in the role of April, receiving 400 letters from fans in two weeks.\n"}

{"id": "4766041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4766041", "title": "Aspazija", "text": "Aspazija\n\nAspazija was the pen name of Elza Johanna Emilija Lizete Pliekšāne (née Elza Rozenberga; 16 March 1865 – 5 November 1943), a Latvian poet and playwright. Aspazija is the Latvian transliteration of Aspasia.\n\nAspazija was born and raised in a wealthy peasant family near Jelgava in 1865, where she studied and was active in youth organizations. She left gymnasium during the last year of studies, and in 1886 married Wilhelm Max Valter. Later she became interested in literature, mainly by German authors. Her first publication appeared in 1887 in the newspaper \"Dienas Lapa\". In 1891 she divorced her husband and until 1893 worked as a private teacher in Jaunsvirlauka. In 1893 she settled in Riga and started to work as journalist. In 1894 her first plays \"Vaidelote\" and \"Zaudētās tiesības\" were staged in Riga.\n\nIn those years she met Jānis Pliekšāns (better known as Rainis), a newspaper editor, poet, lawyer, and a leader of the New Current (Jaunā strāva) movement. Under his influence Aspazija joined the New Current. The couple married in 1897, when they moved to Panevėžys, Lithuania, after the crackdown of New Current. The same year she published her first collection of poetry. For his activities Rainis was imprisoned and later sentenced to five years in exile in Russia from 1897–1903, and Aspazija followed him. Together they translated into Latvian many works of Goethe. Later they returned to Latvia and continued writing, while Rainis also participated in socialist politics.\nThe 1905 Revolution began with protests in St. Petersburg in January. Within days protests spread to Riga and many were killed on 13 January 1905. Aspazija's play \"Vaidelote\" (The Vestal) opened in January and was interpreted as a breakup call from the Imperialist Russia. (Rainis also published a collection of revolutionary poems, \"Vētras Sēja\" (\"The Sowing of the Storm\").) The czar ordered a crack-down, and many revolutionaries were arrested and killed in 1905-6. Therefore, Rainis and Aspazija fled to Switzerland and lived in exile in Castagnola from 1905 to 1920. \n\nWhen they returned to independent Latvia after World War I, Aspazija was active in the feminist movement. She also joined the Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party and was elected to the constitutional assembly. After Rainis died in 1929 Aspazija lived very privately in Riga or in her summer house in Dubulti. She died in 5 November 1943 in Dubulti and was buried in the Rainis cemetery in Riga, next to her husband.\n\nAspazija's first works are realistic, but most of her work is neo-romantic. Some are a nostalgic look to the past. For example, the play \"Vaidelote\" (a female servant to gods in Lithuanian mythology), written in 1894, takes place in the 14th century Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The plays \"Simple Rights\" and \"Unattained Goals\" provoked many discussions because of their protest against the patriarchal society. The play \"Silver Veil\" (\"Sidraba šķidrauts\") is considered to be her best work. In 1923 she wrote a play titled \"Aspazija\".\n\nIn the poetry compilation \"Red Flowers\", simple and ordinary things are viewed in a romantic light. At the same time, her poems are full of light, fantasy, and rebellious moods. In \"Soul's Twilight\" (1904), pessimistic moods take over.\n\nWhile living abroad, Aspazija wrote the poetry compilations \"Sunny Corner\" and \"Spread Wings\", which have fewer social aspects and more intimate text, less rebellion against society, and more personal feelings. \n"}

Outside Italy, it is sometimes known as \"Sangue Napolitano\" (\"Neapolitan Blood\").\n\nAssunta Spina is a laundress living in Naples, engaged to a violent butcher named Michele Mangiafuoco. She is also courted intensely by Raffaele. When she accepts Raffaele's offer to dance during an open air feast in Posillipo because she feels Michele is ignoring her, tragedy strikes. Michele, blinded by rage, slashes her face and is subsequently arrested. During the trial she bears witness in order to rescue him, saying he never wounded her, but the jury does not believe her. She is enticed by the court vice-chancellor to strike a bargain—Michele will stay in the nearby prison of Naples instead of Avellino, and at the end of the punishment Michele will kill the vice-chancellor before Assunta's eyes. She must take responsibility for the act before the eyes of the police in order to save her man.\n\nThe original novel from which the story was taken was written by Salvatore di Giacomo, and had been adapted to a successful theatre drama in 1909. Before Francesca Bertini became a famous actress, she would perform in this drama as a walk-on in the laundry scenes. Five years later, when she had started her career as a film actress, she and actor-director Gustavo Serena adapted the drama for film. Bertini is sometimes listed as co-director of the film. Bertini claimed with some support that she was the director of the film. The film stock was colorized with 4 colors and distributed worldwide by Caesar Film.\n\n\nFrancesca Bertini fully displayed her talent for the first time, introducing a new style of acting on the Italian silver screen. Her performance is generally rated as extraordinary, and in polar opposition to the work of writer and dramatist Gabriele D'Annunzio who was very popular at the time.\nFor example, the movie \"Cabiria\" by Giovanni Pastrone (1914)—one of the first known films where a camera moves through scenes while filming—was once considered a masterpiece at least in part because D'Annunzio had written the captions, but to modern moviegoers they seem excessively emphatic and redundant. The same can be said of the marked gestures of many actors and actresses of the silent era. Bertini wanted to end this affected behavior, so she focused on realism. Her performances bear a closer resemblance to reality because of some acting devices: never look into the camera, use everyday gestures, and so on. The lunch scene in \"Assunta Spina\", for example, still has impact because of these devices. The attempt to reflect reality also reduced the need for captions explaining the action. Even though only a single year passed between the release of \"Cabiria\" and \"Assunta Spina\", there seems to be at least a decade's worth of difference in artistic subtlety and nuance.\n\nIn 1930 the plot of \"Assunta Spina\" inspired a new film by Roberto Roberti. Another was produced in 1948, directed by Mario Mattoli, with Anna Magnani and Eduardo De Filippo as the protagonists.\n"}

The area known as DUMBO used to be known as Gairville. It encompasses two sections: one located between the Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges, which connect Brooklyn to Manhattan across the East River, and another that continues east from the Manhattan Bridge to the Vinegar Hill area. The neighborhood is bounded by Brooklyn Bridge Park to the north, the Brooklyn Bridge to the west, Brooklyn Heights to the south and Vinegar Hill to the east. Dumbo is part of Brooklyn Community Board 2.\n\nThe area was originally a ferry landing, characterized by 19th- and early 20th-century industrial and warehouse buildings, Belgian block streets, and its location on the East River by the imposing anchorage of the Manhattan Bridge. The entirety of Dumbo was bought by developer David Walentas and his company Two Trees Management in the late 20th century, and remade into an upscale residential and commercial community—first becoming a haven for art galleries, and currently a center for technology startups.\n\nThe large community of tech startups earned DUMBO the nickname of \"the center of the Brooklyn Tech Triangle\". In that time, Dumbo had become Brooklyn's most expensive neighborhood, as well as New York City's fourth-richest community overall; this is owing in part to its large concentration of technology startups, its close proximity to Manhattan, and its large number of former industrial buildings that have been converted into spacious luxury residential lofts. The neighborhood is the corporate headquarters for e-commerce retailer Etsy and home furnishing stores company West Elm.\n\nThe name is an acronym of \"Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass\". Several other New York City neighborhoods are known by portmanteaus, including Tribeca, SoHo, NoHo, NoMad, and Nolita in Manhattan, and BoCoCa in Brooklyn.\n\nThe area has been known variously as Rapailie, Olympia, and Walentasville. The \"Olympia\" name came from Comfort and Joshua Sands, who bought the land in 1787 and were planning to develop the land as a summer place for New Yorkers. Through the 18th and 19th centuries, the area now known as Dumbo was considered part of Vinegar Hill.\n\nIn the 1890s, the western portion of the neighborhood was known as Fulton Landing, after the ferry stop that connected it to Manhattan before the Brooklyn Bridge opened. At that time, it was primarily a manufacturing district, with warehouses and factories that made machinery, paper boxes and Brillo soap pads. The area has been known variously as Rapailie, Olympia, and Walentasville. The cardboard box was invented in the Robert Gair building on Washington Street by Robert Gair, a Scottish emigrant; because of Gair's fame, the area was known as Gairsville for a long time. The Gair building is now home to Etsy.>\n\nThe Jay Street Connecting Railroad ran through Dumbo's waterfront from circa 1904–1906 through 1957. It ran from rail yards beneath the Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges to buildings near the waterfront in Dumbo and Vinegar Hill. At the height of operations, it had spurs into several buildings, a car float bridge on Bridge Street, and a yard with capacity of 120 cars. The tracks were abandoned in 1959, though the railroad's tracks are still visible on streets in Dumbo.\n\nWith the deindustrialization of New York City, Dumbo began to become primarily residential; artists and other young homesteaders seeking relatively large and inexpensive loft apartment spaces for studios and homes began moving there in the late 1970s. The acronym \"Dumbo\" arose in 1978, when new residents coined it in the belief such an unattractive name would help deter developers.\n\nNear the end of the 20th century, as property became more and more expensive in Manhattan, Dumbo became increasingly gentrified. Even so, the acronym 'Dumbo' was largely unknown as late as 1997, and the area itself was very inclusive, serving mainly as an enclave for artists located along the East River and under the Manhattan Bridge. At this stage there were still many air conditioner repair shops, auto shops, and \"seedy back alleys and wharves\"; and, because the neighborhood was still gentrifying from its industrial past, it lacked even a bookstore, coffee shop, or laundromat. The efforts of Joy Glidden, the Founding Director of the Dumbo Arts Center (DAC) and co-founder of the Dumbo Art Under the Bridge Festival, achieved successful development in Dumbo, which is now a model for similar waterfront developments around the world. Glidden stated of Dumbo's gentrification, \"It may be one of the last of what could be considered a true arts community in New York.\" \n\nThe DUMBO Historic District, a historic industrial complex and national historic district in Dumbo, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. It consists of 95 contributing buildings; the manufacturing concerns located in this district included Benjamin Moore & Co. (paint), Arbuckle Brothers (coffee and sugar), J.W. Masury & Son (paint), Robert Gair (paper boxes), E.W. Bliss (machinery), and Brillo (soap pads). The district includes the earliest large-scale reinforced concrete factory buildings in America. On December 18, 2007, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission voted unanimously to designate Dumbo as the city's 90th historic district. The Dumbo historic district consists of properties bound by John Street to the north, York Street to the south, Main Street to the west, and Bridge Street to the east.\n\nThe area has emerged as one of New York City's premier arts districts, with a cluster of for-profit art galleries such as the Klompching Gallery, and such not-for-profit institutions as the St. Ann's Warehouse and the A.I.R. Gallery.\n\nChef Jacques Torres opened a chocolate factory in Dumbo in December 2000. Other culinary businesses in the area include Grimaldi's, the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory, and The River Café, all clustered in Fulton Landing, also home to Bargemusic, a floating venue for classical music.\n\nInvitations for the 2009 presidential inauguration of U.S. President Barack Obama were printed by Dumbo printer Precise Continental.\n\nThe first public space in the neighborhood was Fulton Ferry, followed by Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park. The first six acres of Brooklyn Bridge Park, a joint state/city venture under development, were opened in March 2010.\n\nThe building at 200 Water Street, which the Brillo Manufacturing Co. once occupied, is being renovated as a high-end condo building.\n\nDumbo has New York City's highest concentration of technology firms by neighborhood. Dumbo is home to 25 percent of New York City-based tech firms. Within a 10-block radius are 500 tech and creative firms that employ over 10,000 people. It also contains the corporate headquarters for e-commerce retailer Etsy and home furnishing stores company West Elm.\nThe City of New York, in conjunction with New York University, installed an incubator in Dumbo to support development of tech start-ups. Dumbo's average office rent of $25 per square foot makes it more attractive to start-ups than Manhattan, where rents averaged $40 per square foot in 2013. The area has been compared to the Silicon Roundabout area in Shoreditch, East London, as well as to Manhattan's Silicon Alley.\n\nNew York City Subway stations are located at York Street () on the IND Sixth Avenue Line, and High Street () on the IND Eighth Avenue Line. New York City Bus service is provided by the .\n\nRamps and staircases connect the Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan Bridge walkways to Dumbo.\n\nIn June 2011, NY Waterway started service to points along the East River. On May 1, 2017, that route became part of the NYC Ferry's East River route, which runs between Pier 11/Wall Street in Manhattan's Financial District and the East 34th Street Ferry Landing in Murray Hill, Manhattan, with five intermediate stops in Brooklyn and Queens. One of the East River Ferry's stops is at Fulton Ferry in Dumbo.\n\nThe neighborhood contains the Farragut Houses, a group of ten towers managed by the New York City Housing Authority.\n\n"}

{"id": "8395427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8395427", "title": "Economics of the arts and literature", "text": "Economics of the arts and literature\n\nEconomics of the arts and literature or cultural economics (used below for convenience) is a branch of economics that studies the economics of creation, distribution, and the consumption of works of art, literature and similar creative and/or cultural products. For a long time, the concept of the \"arts\" were confined to visual arts (e.g., painting) and performing arts (music, theatre, dance) in the Anglo-Saxon tradition. Usage has widened since the beginning of the 1980s with the study of cultural industry (cinema, television programs, book and periodical publishing and music publishing) and the economy of cultural institutions (museums, libraries, historic buildings). The field is coded as in the \"Journal of Economic Literature\" classification system used for article searches.\n\nCultural economics is concerned with the arts in a broad sense. The goods considered have creative content, but that is not enough to qualify as a cultural good. Designer goods such as clothes and drapes are not considered usually to be works of art or culture. Cultural goods are those with a value determined by symbolic content rather than physical characteristics. (For further considerations, see also Cultural Institutions Studies). Economic thinking has been applied in ever more areas in the last decennia, including pollution, corruption and education.\n\nWorks of art and culture have a specific quality, which is their uniqueness. While other economic goods, such as crude oil or wheat are generic, interchangeable commodities (given a specific grade of the product), there is only one example of a famous painting such as the Mona Lisa, and only one example of Rodin's well-known sculpture \"The Thinker\". While copies or reproductions can be made of these works of art, and while many inexpensive posters of the Mona Lisa and small factory-made replicas of \"The Thinker\" are sold, neither full-size copies nor inexpensive reproductions are viewed as substitutes for the real artworks, in the way that a consumer views a pound of Grade A sugar from Cuba as a fully equivalent substitute for a pound of Grade A sugar from United States or Dominican Republic. As there is no equivalent item or substitute for these famous works of art, classical economist Adam Smith held it was impossible to value them. Alfred Marshall noted that the demand for a certain kind of cultural good can depend on its consumption: The more you have listened to a particular kind of music, the more you appreciate. In his economic framework, these goods do not have the usual decreasing marginal utility.\n\nKey academic works in cultural economics include those of Baumol and Bowen (Performing Arts, The Economic Dilemma, 1966), of Gary Becker on addictive goods, and of Alan Peacock (public choice). This summary has been divided into sections on the economic study of the performing arts, on the market of individual pieces of art, the art market in cultural industries, the economics of cultural heritage and the labour market in the art sector.\n\nThe seminal paper by William Baumol and Bowen introduced the term cost disease for a relative cost growth of live performances. This cost growth explains the increasing dependency of this kind of art on state subsidies. It occurs when the consumable good is labour itself. To understand this phenomenon, compare the change in the cost of performing the Molière play \"Tartuffe\" in 1664 and in 2007 with the change in cost of calculating a large number of sums from an accounting ledger. In 1664, you needed two hours and twelve actors to perform Molière's play, and it would take, say, twelve accountants working for two hours to add up all the sums in an accounting ledger. In 2007, a single accountant with a $10 calculator can add the sums in 20 minutes, but you still need two hours and twelve actors for the Molière play. Artists must make a considerable investment in human capital (e.g., training), and needs to be paid accordingly. The artists' pay needs to rise along with that of the population in general. As the latter is following the general productivity in the economy, the cost of a play will rise with general productivity, while the actors' productivity does not rise.\n\nThere are two lines of thought in subsequent literature on the economics of the performing arts:\n\n\nTwo segments of the market in the visual arts can be distinguished: works of art that are familiar and have a history, and contemporary works that are more easily influenced by fashion and new discoveries. Both markets, however, are oligopolistic, i.e., there are limited numbers of sellers and buyers (oligopsony). Two central questions on the working of the markets are: How are prices determined, and what is the return on artworks, compared to the return on financial assets?\n\nComponents of a work of art, like raw stone, tubes of paint or unpainted canvas, in general have a value much lower than the finished products, such as a sculpture or a finished painting. Also, the amount of labour needed to produce an item does not explain the big price differences between works of art. It seems that the value is much more dependent on potential buyers', and experts' perception of it. This perception has three elements: First, social value, which is the social status the buyer has by owning it. The artist thus has an \"artistic capital\". Second, the artistic value, compared to contemporary works, or as importance to later generations. Third, the price history of the item, if a buyer uses this for his expectation of a future price at which he might sell the item again (given the oligopolistic market structure).\nThree kinds of economic agents determine these values. Specific experts like gallery owners or museum directors use the first, social value. Experts like art historians and art professors use the second, artistic value. Buyers who buy works of art as an investment use the third, the price history and expectations for future price increases.\n\nSome major financial institutions, banks and insurance companies, have had considerable return rates on investments in art works in the 1990s. These rates have not slowed down at the same time as the rates on stock exchanges, in the early 90's. This may indicate a diversification opportunity. Apart from this evidence of successful investment, the amount of data available has stimulated study of the market. Many works are sold on auctions. These transactions are thus very transparent. This has made it possible to establish price databases, with prices of some items going back to 1652. Empirical studies have shown that, on average, the return on works of art has been lower than that on equity, with a volatility that is at least as high. An intangible gain in terms of pleasure of having a work of art could explain this partly. However, before interpreting the figures, it should be borne in mind that art is often exempt of many kinds of taxes. In 1986, Baumol made an estimate of an average yearly rate of return of 0.55 percent for works of art, against a rate of return of 2.5 percent for financial assets, over a 20-year period.\n\nSome famous artworks such as the \"Mona Lisa\" painting are not reproducible (at least in the sense of creating another copy that would be seen as equivalent in value), but there are many cultural goods whose value does not depend on a single, individual copy. Books, recordings, movies get some of their value from the existence of many copies of the original. These are the products of major cultural industries, which are the book industry, the music industry and the film industry. These markets are characterized by:\n\nThe important cultural industries tend to have an oligopolistic market structure. The market is dominated by a few major companies, with the rest of the market consisting of many small companies. The latter may act as a filter or as \"gatekeepers\" for the artistic supply. A small company with a successful artist or good quality roster can be bought by one of the major companies. Big conglomerates, pooling TV and film production, have existed for decades. The 1990s have seen some mergers extending beyond the industry as such, and mergers of hardware producers with content providers. Anticipated gains from synergy and market power have not been realised, and from the early 2000s there has been a trend towards organisation along sector lines.\n\nCultural heritage is reflected in goods and real estate. Management and regulation of museums has come under study in this area.\n\nMuseums, which have a conservatory role, and provide exhibitions to the general public, can be commercial, or on a non-profit base. In the second case, as they provide a public good, they pose the problems related to these goods: should they be self-financing, or be subsidized ? One of the specific issues is the imbalance between the huge value of the collections in museums, and their budgets. Also, they are often located in places (city centres) where the cost of land is high, which limits their expansion possibilities. American museums exhibit only about half of their collection. Some museums in Europe, like the Pompidou Centre in France, show less than 5 percent of their collection. Apart from providing exhibitions, museums get proceeds from derived products, like catalogues and reproductions. They also produce at a more intangible level: They make collections. Out of so many pieces in the public domain, they make a selection based on their expertise, thus adding value to the mere existence of the items.\n\nThe dual goal of conservation and providing exhibitions obviously presents a choice. On the one hand the museum has, for conservation reasons, an interest in exhibiting as few items as possible, and it would select lesser known works and a specialized audience, to promote knowledge and research. On the other hand, the exhibition argument requires showing the major pieces from different cultures, to satisfy the demands from the public and to attract a large audience. When a government has made a choice about this, application of economic contract theory will help to implement this choice by showing how to use incentives to different managers (on the financial, conservatory side) to obtain the required result.\n\nMany countries have systems that protect historically significant buildings and structures. These are buildings or other structures that are deemed to have cultural importance or which are deemed to have heritage value. Owners get tax deductions or subsidies for restoration, in return for which they accept restrictions on modifications to the buildings or provide public access. Buildings that are often classified as heritage buildings include former or current Parliament buildings, cathedrals, courthouses, houses built in a recognized historical style, and even fairly regular houses, if the house was formerly the home of a famous politician, artist or inventor. Buildings with heritage status cannot typically be demolished. Depending on the nature of the heritage restrictions, the current owner may or may not be allowed to modify the outside or inside of the building. Such a system poses the same choice problems as museums do. There has been little study of this issue.\n\nThe labour market for artists is characterized by:\n\nThe term \"star system\", coined by Sherwin Rosen, is used to explain why a very small number of the artists and creators in the market, such as the celebrity A-list actors and top pop singers, earn most of the total earnings in a sector. Rosen's 1981 paper examined the economics of superstars to determine why “relatively small numbers of people earn enormous amounts of money and seem to dominate the fields in which they engage.” Rosen argues that in superstar markets, \"small differences in talent at the top of the distribution will translate into large differences in revenue.\" Rosen points out that \"...sellers of higher talent charge only slightly higher prices than those of lower talent, but sell much larger quantities; their greater earnings come overwhelmingly from selling larger quantities than from charging higher prices\".\n\nIn cultural industries, the uncertainty about the quality of a product plays a key role in this. The consumer does not really know how good the product is, until he or she has consumed it (think of a movie), and the producer is confronted with the typical uncertainty in a cultural industry. The consumer looks for guidance in the price, reputation, or a famous name on the cover or poster. As the producer understands this using a famous director, actor or singer affects demand, he or she is prepared to pay a lot for a name considered a sign of quality (a star). Indeed, authors like Adler and Ginsburgh have given evidence that star status is determined by chance: in a musical contest, results were highly correlated with the order of performance. This randomness has been used to explain why the labor supply in the sector remains excessive: given the extreme gains of a star, and an irrational behaviour, or particular preferences, with respect to chance, unsuccessful artists keep trying, even when they are earning their money mostly in a different trade, such as waiting tables. A second argument is the possibility of intangible returns to artists' labour in terms of social status and lifestyle. For example, even a struggling DJ spends most of her time onstage on nightclubs and raves, which for some people is a desirable outcome.\n\nA case has been made for the existence of a different structure in the production of cultural goods . (See Cultural Institutions Studies.) An artist often considers a product to be an expression of himself, while the ordinary craftsperson is only concerned with his product, as far as it affects his/her pay or salary. For example, a painter who creates artworks that are displayed in museums may view her paintings as her artistic expression. On the other hand, a scene painter for a music theatre company may see herself as a craftsperson who is paid by the hour for doing painting. The artist may thus want restrict the use of his or her product, and he/she may object if a museum uses a reproduction of his/her painting to help sell cars or liquor. On the other hand, the scene painter may not object to commercial re-uses of her set painting, as she/he may see it just as a regular job.\n\n\n\n"}

In 2008, \"The Guardian\" placed it as the second most beautiful bookshop in the world.\n\nSituated on Santa Fe Avenue in Barrio Norte, the building was designed by architects Peró and Torres Armengol for impresario Max Glücksmann (1875-1946), and opened as a theatre called \"Teatro Gran Splendid\" in May 1919. The ecleticist building features ceiling frescoes painted by the Italian artist Nazareno Orlandi and caryatids sculpted by Troiano Troiani, whose work also graces the cornice along the Palacio de la Legislatura de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires.\n\nThe theatre had a seating capacity of 1,050, and staged a variety of performances, including appearances by the tango artists Carlos Gardel, Francisco Canaro, Roberto Firpo and Ignacio Corsini. Glücksmann started his own radio station in 1924 (\"Radio Splendid\"), which broadcast from the building where his recording company, \"Nacional Odeón\", made some of the early recordings of the great tango singers of the day. In the late twenties the theatre was converted into a cinema, and in 1929 showed the first sound films presented in Argentina.\n\nThe ornate former theatre was leased by Grupo Ilhsa in February 2000. Ilhsa, through Tematika, owns El Ateneo and Yenny booksellers (totaling over 40 stores), as well as the El Ateneo publishing house. The building was subsequently renovated and converted into a book and music shop under the direction of architect Fernando Manzone; the cinema seating was removed and in its place book shelves were installed. Following refurbishment works, the El Ateneo Grand Splendid became the group's flagship store, and in 2007 sold over 700,000 books; over a million people walk through its doors annually.\n\nChairs are provided throughout the building, including the still-intact theatre boxes, where customers can dip into books before purchase, and there is now a café on the back of what was once the stage. The ceiling, the ornate carvings, the crimson stage curtains, the auditorium lighting and many architectural details remain. Despite the changes, the building still retains the feeling of the grand theatre it once was. \"The Guardian\", a prominent British periodical, named El Ateneo Grand Splendid second in its 2008 list of the world's ten best bookshops.\n"}
{"id": "3931064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3931064", "title": "Fallen Astronaut", "text": "Fallen Astronaut\n\nFallen Astronaut is an aluminium sculpture created by Paul Van Hoeydonck. It is a small stylized figure, meant to depict an astronaut in a spacesuit, intended to commemorate the astronauts and cosmonauts who have died in the advancement of space exploration. It was commissioned and placed on the Moon by the crew of Apollo 15 at Hadley Rille on August 1, 1971, next to a plaque listing the fourteen men known at the time to have died.\n\nThe crew kept the memorial's existence a secret until after completion of their mission. After public disclosure, the National Air and Space Museum requested and received a replica of the statue. Controversy soon followed, as Van Hoeydonck claimed a different understanding of the agreement made with the astronauts and attempted to sell up to 950 copies of the statue. He finally relented under pressure from NASA, which has a strict policy against commercial exploitation of the US government space program.\n\nPrior to his Apollo 15 lunar mission, astronaut David Scott met Belgian painter and printmaker Paul Van Hoeydonck at a dinner party. It was there agreed that Van Hoeydonck would create a small statuette for Scott to place on the Moon, though their recollections of the details disagree. Scott's purpose was to commemorate those astronauts and cosmonauts who had lost their lives in the furtherance of space exploration, and he designed and separately made a plaque listing fourteen American and Soviet names. Van Hoeydonck was given a set of design specifications: the sculpture was to be lightweight but sturdy, capable of withstanding the temperature extremes of the Moon; it could not be identifiably male or female, nor of any identifiable ethnic group. According to Scott, it was agreed Van Hoeydonck's name would not be made public, to avoid the commercial exploitation of the US government's space program. Scott kept the agreement secret from NASA management prior to the mission, smuggling the statue aboard his spacecraft.\n\nVan Hoeydonck gives a different account of the agreement: according to an interview in Belgian newspaper \"Le Soir\", the statue was supposed to be a representation of all mankind, not only fallen astronauts or cosmonauts. He claimed he did not know the statue would be used as a memorial for the fallen space-goers, and the name given to the work was neither chosen nor approved by him; he had intended the figure to be left standing upright. He also denies it was agreed he would remain anonymous. Both his and Scott's versions of events are given in an article in \"Slate\" magazine in 2013.\n\nDuring the Apollo 15 mission, near the completion of his work on the lunar surface on August 1, 1971, Scott secretly placed the \"Fallen Astronaut\" on the Moon, along with a plaque bearing the names of eight American astronauts and six Soviet cosmonauts who had died in service:\n\nScott photographed the memorial, but waited for a post-mission press conference to publicly disclose its existence. Later, he noted that \"Sadly, two names are missing (from the plaque), those of Valentin Bondarenko and Grigori Nelyubov.\" He explained that the western world was unaware of their deaths, because of the secrecy surrounding the Soviet space program at the time. Also missing was the name of Robert Henry Lawrence Jr., the first black astronaut and a U.S. Air Force officer selected for the Manned Orbiting Laboratory program who was killed in a training accident in 1967.\n\nAfter the crew disclosed the statuette's existence during their press conference, the National Air and Space Museum requested that a replica be made for public display. The crew agreed, on condition that it be displayed \"with good taste and without publicity\". The replica was given to the Smithsonian Institution on April 17, 1972, the day after CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite referred to the \"Fallen Astronaut\" and plaque as the first art installation on the Moon during the broadcast of the Apollo 16 launch. It is now on display with a replica of the plaque in the Museum's National Mall Building in the Space Race Wing, Gallery 114.\n\nIn May 1972, Scott learned that Van Hoeydonck planned to make and sell more replicas. Believing that this would be a violation of the spirit of their agreement, and NASA's policy against commercial exploitation of the space program, Scott tried to persuade Van Hoeydonck to refrain. It was advertised in a full-page advertisement in the July 1972 issue of \"Art in America\" magazine, that 950 replicas of \"Fallen Astronaut\" signed by the sculptor would be sold by the Waddell Gallery of New York for $750 each; a second edition, at a lower, unspecified price; and a catalog edition, at $5.\n\nAfter complaints from NASA about the intended sale, Van Hoeydonck retracted his permission for it and no statues were sold.\n\nOn September 11, 2007, art journalist Jan Stalmans wrote to Van Hoeydonck, asking him how many replicas were in existence. Van Hoeydonk returned a handwritten response on the letter, that 50 copies had been made, most of which were still in his possession, unsigned. Van Hoeydonck wrote that he had only ever received money for one copy of \"Fallen Astronaut\", despite many purchase offers he had received (see the English translation ).\n\n\n\n"}

Numerous other non-Sega/Sammy properties are also referenced throughout the anime, but their names are changed slightly, such as \"The King of Fighters '95\" being alluded to as \"COF 95\" and \"Capcom vs SNK 2\" as \"S-Cup\". Discussion of \"eroge\", erotic video games usually of the visual novel genre, also occurs often.\n\nSimilar to the treatment of video games in the series, popular anime and manga are often alluded to by pseudonyms, such as \"\"Gungal\" (\"Gundam\"), \"Reass Mood\" (\"Code Geass\"), \"Haregan\" (\"Hagane no Renkinjutsushi/Fullmetal Alchemist\"), \"Scram Dunk\" (\"Slam Dunk\"), \"Neko Yasha\"\" (\"InuYasha\"), and many others. \"Genshiken\" usually avoids referring to these series so in-depth that it would require the use of names and lines from their real-world counterparts, with several notable exceptions: in the model-building chapter of the manga (but not the anime), actual \"Gundam\" mecha and characters are referred to throughout, while the dialogue quoted by Sue (except for one \"Neko Yasha!\" outburst) is pulled directly from \"Evangelion\", \"Lupin III\", \"Azumanga Daioh\", and other series.\n\nThese cultural references have remained intact for the English adaption of the manga, which include a section for translation notes. However, due to the number of allusions made and the inability for a translator to always know what is being referred to, many explanations of \"otaku\" references are still absent. The anime however, has been criticized for having \"excessive script variances\" with its English dub translations, such as injecting English specific references like \"talk to the hand\" and for inconsistently including liner notes.\n\nRamen Angel Pretty Menma\n\nAnother fictitious series created for the series is \"Ramen Angel Pretty Menma\", a generic adult visual novel. Mentioned in passing as Sasahara's first such game in the manga, it is given much greater emphasis in the second TV series. The plot revolves around Kaoru Torigara, only son of a ramen shop owner, who is going to renovate his inherited ramen shop. He discovers that his shop has a guardian angel named Pretty Menma. Pretty Menma tells Kaoru that his dead father's intention is making him succeed in the \"Food King Wars\", a battle of restaurants around the world that is held every 4 years. Kaoru and Menma must help each other to go through the struggles of the \"Food King Wars\". In the anime, there is also \"Ramen Angel Pretty Menma 2\", which continues from the first version. Additionally, the third version of the opening sequence (that uses the same song, but adds scenes and edits existing ones) shows Ogiue cosplaying Pretty Menma, Ohno cosplaying Cutie Tonko (another heroine in this series who represents \"tonkotsu\", a form of ramen broth), and Kasukabe cosplaying Menma's mother. This series is also spun off into its own Internet radio show, manga (serialized in \"Monthly Comic Alive\") and a drama CD.\n\n\"Genshiken\" follows the lives of a group of college students drawn together by their shared hobbies, and the trials and adventures associated with being otaku. The story begins with the introduction of Kanji Sasahara, a shy, confidence-lacking freshman who on club day at university, decides to join a club he would actually enjoy, Genshiken. Over his four years at Shiiou University, Sasahara comes to accept himself for who he is and loses the inhibitions and guilt he once felt and associated with otaku culture, becoming an enthusiastic clubmember, and for a time, a capable club president. As the story of \"Genshiken\" progresses, focus is also placed on Saki Kasukabe, a determined non-otaku who initially struggles to drag her boyfriend Kousaka out of the club, and Chika Ogiue, a self-professed otaku-hater who feels a deep-seated shame and self-loathing toward her own interests and hobbies.\n\nDuring the course of the series, the reader bears witness as the group grows in its cohesiveness over time, and bonds form between the characters as they begin to see themselves as more than fellow club members, but friends as well. In this context, club activities such as group outings, the biannual pilgrimage to Comifes, and even simply hanging out in the clubroom, allow the characters' complex relationships to grow into friendship, infatuation, and at times, even love. While a few of them never quite see eye-to-eye about their interests or the lives they lead, they are held together by the bonds of friendship that they share.\n\nAfter Sasahara, Kousaka and Kasukabe graduate, the series shifts focus to three new club members: The self-conscious Yajima, the energetic-yet-annoying Yoshitake, and Hato, a male fujoshi who cross-dresses fit in better and go unrecognized from his normal classmates. Emphasis is also put on the character of Madarame, a former president of the club who actually graduated a year before Sasahara, but remained in the club due to working and having an apartment nearby and hanging out in the clubroom in his time off and struggles to grow up and move on from university.\n\nThe manga was brought to television by the production company Genco through animation studio Palm in 2004 as a twelve-episode anime and in 2006 and 2007 as a three-episode OVA, adapting the first five volumes of the manga. The TV series was licensed for North American release by Media Blasters.\n\nThe anime adaptation is very faithful to the original work, with few revisions being made, with the exception that many references to specific anime, manga, and video games are changed or removed. The previously fictional \"Kujibiki Unbalance\" manga series was also turned into an anime series to match the medium, with three complete episodes being created for sampling in the anime version of \"Genshiken\". The three \"Kujibiki Unbalance\" episodes are provided as bonus OVAs with the purchase of the \"Genshiken\" DVDs.\n\nIt was originally announced by Media Factory at Comiket 69 that the second TV series of \"Genshiken\" would premiere in October 2006. However, Media Factory clarified their statement in May 2006, saying that the series airing in the fall would be a full-fledged \"Kujibiki Unbalance\" series, rather than a \"Genshiken\" sequel. Nevertheless, the DVD releases of the new \"Kujibiki Unbalance\" series each included an OVA episode of \"Genshiken\", for a total of three new episodes. The first new episode was released with \"Kujibiki Unbalance\" DVD Box 1 on December 22, 2006, with the two subsequent installments following on February 23 and April 25, 2007, respectively.\n\nOn April 23, 2007, it was announced on the \"Genshiken\" homepage that a second anime television series would be produced, including the character Ogiue, who had been introduced in the OVA episodes. The first episode of the second series aired on October 11, 2007 on Japanese TV. A radio webcast ran simultaneously with the terrestrial broadcast. The final episode of the series aired on December 27, 2007; however, it did not conclude the story.\n\nThe TV version of \"Genshiken 2\" aired with minor censorship. Oddly though, the censorship was that of a highly erotic kiss that involved no nudity. Additional nudity like breast nipples and strong cleavage was also censored. The DVD version shows everything uncensored.\n\nIn the March issue of \"Monthly Afternoon\" it was announced that a new anime had been authorized for \"Genshiken: Second Season\". The new anime sequel is directed by Tsutomu Mizushima at Production I.G, with Michiko Yokote serving as the series composition. The series premiered in July 7, 2013 and includes the opening song \"Genshi, Joshi wa, Taiyo Datta\" by Sumire Uesaka and the band Kabuki Rocks. At Anime Expo 2013, NIS America announced their acquisition of \"Genshiken: Second Season\" for North American release.\n\nA \"Genshiken: Second Season\" OAD (Original Animation DVD) was bundled with the limited edition of the 15th volume of the \"Genshiken\" manga, released in Dec 20, 2013. The story is set between the events of the \"Genshiken 2\" and \"Genshiken: Second Season\" series.\n\nThere has been three drama CD bundled together with different media in the series. The first one was released as a \"first press\" item for the 9th volume of the manga, while the two others were included in the two first volumes of the \"Genshiken 2\" DVDs.\n\nList of releases:\n\n\nIn 2008, Kodansha released the light novel \"Shoron Genshiken: Hairu Ranto no Yabou\", with Del Rey releasing the book in June 2010. The book introduces the character of Ranto Hairu, the rich grandson of one of Japan's most influential businessmen, as he takes over the student club organization with the intention of getting rid of any elements he views as unsavory. Meanwhile, a supernatural force is slowly abducting members of Genshiken without a trace.\n\nChronologically the book falls just after certain events in the second volume, although it should be noted that few of the book's events follow the story elements already established in the series. Changes such as Kuchiki remaining with the Genshiken after his initial attempts to join, the established president of the student club organization drops out due to pregnancy, as well as Ohno and Tanaka's relationship being more established than it was during this point in time. The light novel also introduces several characters that are only present in the novel itself and do not appear in the anime or manga. Also of note is that there are several elements present in the book (such as the supernatural) that are not present in the anime or manga.\n\n\"Genshiken\" has been praised for its execution of the slice-of-life genre, in that it is able to be funny while still maintaining a strong sense of reality. Anime News Network reviewer Bamboo Dong's review of the first manga volume called \"Genshiken\" \"one of the best manga series out this year\", praising Shimoku Kio's attention to detail and David Ury's translation work. \"Genshiken\" was also selected as one of the Manga Division Jury Recommended Works in the 2005 Japan Media Arts Festival.\n\n\n"}

It was written and directed by Elizabeth Gill.\n\nThe movie is set around a small group of characters experiencing relationships which build and crumble before the viewers' eyes. The title of the film refers to the belief, expressed by several of characters, that the goldfish retains a memory of something for only three seconds. Tom, one of the principal characters in the film, draws comparisons between this and the human tendency to jump from one relationship to the next, \"forgetting\" the pain that any previous one might have caused. The film shows complexities involved in straight, gay, lesbian, and bisexual relationships.

{"id": "297436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=297436", "title": "Hard-edge painting", "text": "Hard-edge painting\n\nHard-edge painting is painting in which abrupt transitions are found between color areas. Color areas are often of one unvarying color. The Hard-edge painting style is related to Geometric abstraction, Op Art, Post-painterly Abstraction, and Color Field painting.\n\nThe term was coined by writer, curator and \"Los Angeles Times\" art critic Jules Langsner, along with Peter Selz, in 1959, to describe the work of painters from California, who, in their reaction to the more painterly or gestural forms of Abstract expressionism, adopted a knowingly impersonal paint application and delineated areas of color with particular sharpness and clarity. This approach to abstract painting became widespread in the 1960s, though California was its creative center. \n\nOther, earlier, movements, or styles have also contained the quality of hard-edgedness, for instance the Precisionists also displayed this quality to a great degree in their work. Hard-edge can be seen to be associated with one or more school of painting, but is also a generally descriptive term, for these qualities found in any painting. Hard-edged painting can be both figurative or nonrepresentational.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Langsner and Peter Selz, then professor at the Claremont Colleges, observed a common link among the recent work of John McLaughlin (1898–1976), Lorser Feitelson (1898-1978), Karl Benjamin (1925-2012), Frederick Hammersley (1919–2009) and Feitelson's wife Helen Lundeberg (1908-1999). The group of seven gathered at the Feitelson's home to discuss a group exhibition of this nonfigurative painting style. Curated by Langsner, \"Four Abstract Classicists\" opened at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1959. Helen Lundeberg was not included in the exhibit. These painters were featured in a touring exhibition during 2008 called \"The Birth of the Cool\" in California museums along with midcentury design, music and film.\n\n\"Four Abstract Classicists\" was subtitled \"California Hard-edge\" by British art critic and curator Lawrence Alloway when it traveled to England and Ireland. The term came into broader use after Alloway used it to describe contemporary American geometric abstract painting featuring \"economy of form,\" \"fullness of color,\" \"neatness of surface,\" and the nonrelational arrangement of forms on the canvas.\n\nIn 1964, a second major hard-edge exhibition curated by Jules Langsner was held at the Pavilion Gallery in Balboa, CA (also known as the Newport Pavilion) with the cooperation of the Ankrum Gallery, Esther Robles Gallery, Felix Landau Gallery, Ferus Gallery and Heritage Gallery of Los Angeles. This was called, simply, \"California Hard-edge painting.\" Included in this show were Florence Arnold, John Barbour, Larry Bell, Karl Benjamin, John Coplans, Lorser Feitelson, Frederick Hammersley, June Harwood, Helen Lundeberg, John McLaughlin, and Dorothy Waldman.\n\nIn 2000, Tobey C. Moss curated \"Four Abstract Classicists Plus One\" at her gallery in Los Angeles. The exhibit again featured John McLaughlin, Feitelson, Hammersley, and Benjamin, and added Lundeberg as the fifth of the original Hard-edge painters. In 2003, Louis Stern Fine Arts showed a retrospective exhibition for Lorser Feitelson entitled \"Lorser Feitelson and the invention of Hard-edge painting, 1945-1965.\" The same year, NOHO MODERN showed the works of June Harwood in an exhibition entitled \"June Harwood: Hard-edge painting Revisited, 1959-1969.\" Art critic Dave Hickey solidified the place of these 6 artists in: \"The Los Angeles School: Karl Benjamin, Lorser Feitelson, Frederick Hammersley, June Harwood, Helen Lundeberg, and John McLaughlin.\" The exhibition was held at the Ben Maltz Gallery of the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles in 2004-2005.\n\nThis style of hard-edge geometric abstraction recalls the earlier work of Kasimir Malevich, Wassily Kandinsky, Theo van Doesburg, and Piet Mondrian. Other artists associated with Hard-edge painting include Herb Aach, Josef Albers, Richard Anuszkiewicz, Max Bill, Ilya Bolotowsky, Herbert Busemann, Ralph Coburn, Nassos Daphnis, Ronald Davis, Gene Davis, Robyn Denny, Howard Mehring, Burgoyne Diller, John Ferren, Peter Halley, Al Held, Robert Indiana, Ellsworth Kelly, Günther C.

{"id": "49287751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49287751", "title": "Kaufmann Crucifixion", "text": "Kaufmann Crucifixion\n\nThe Kaufmann Crucifixion is a Bohemian Gothic panel painting by an unknown artist that dates from 1340-1360. It was most probably the central part of a relatively small folding altarpiece. \nThe picture was probably painted in Prague. It was acquired from the Berlin collection of Richard von Kaufmann (1849-1908) by the Berlin art dealers Pavel Cassirer and F.W. Lippmann along with Hugo Helbing from Munich, who donated it to the then Kaiser Friedrich Museum in Berlin. From there, the picture found its way to the Gemäldegalerie Berlin.\n\nThe tempera painting on a wooden panel covered with stretched canvas is 67 x 29.5 cm in size. It was restored in 1918 and fixed to a fresh canvas base.\nIn the Bohemian context, it is the first known depiction of Calvary with three crosses and a complexity of events beneath them, which both point to an Italian influence. The composition of space and the use of perspectival shortening are also Italian in origin. At the same time, other elements of the painting such as the wealth of rhythm in the figures’ movement, the sharp drawing, the plastic modelling and the Gothic vividness of colour also point to Lower Austrian and western European (French) models. The dramatically focused naturalism is something of an exception to the otherwise lyrical atmosphere of Bohemian painting. Although the overall stylistic conception of the picture has a number of features that correspond to the work of the Master of the Vyšší Brod Altarpiece, it is in fact a later work by another artist that represents a progression from mystically religious expression to a dramatic presentation of reality and the intensifying of its effect.\nOpinion is divided among art historians as to the work’s Bohemian origin, some of them considering it to be the work of an Austrian artist who emerged from the workshop of the Master of the Klosterneuburg Altarpiece (de: \"Meister der Rückseite des Verduner Altars\"). This is also connected with the dating of the work that some, in connection with the Klosterneuburg Altarpiece (1331) have pinpointed to the later period of John of Luxembourg (1340) while others judge it to be influenced by Italian art (such the picture The Crucifixion by Simone Martini of 1342) and consider it more likely to have been painted after 1350.\n\nIn its form, the Kaufmann Crucifixion is a perfect work that has no parallels in European painting of that period. Several of its motifs were later often adopted, especially that of the man sitting on the ground with one leg bent and the other stretched out. Works inspired by the Kaufmann Crucifixion can be evidenced in surviving panel paintings, though also in manuscript illuminations in Bohemia and other countries.\n\n\n"}

It offers bursaries for writing projects, runs literary events and lectures, and provides financial assistance for creative mentoring and other literary-based ventures. The organisation also selects the National Poet for Wales, and manages competitions including Wales Book of the Year, the Cardiff International Poetry Competition, and the Rhys Davies Short Story Competition.\n\nThe Academi was initially formed as a Welsh language society in 1959, following a public discussion between Robert Maynard Jones and poet Waldo Williams. The Academi attracted notable Welsh writers and academics into its society from the start, and while a Welsh language-only publication, had as its chairmen Iorwerth Peate (1959–63), T. J. Morgan (1963–66) and J. E. Caerwyn Williams (1966–1975). An English language section was added in 1968 through the initiative of editor and linguist Meic Stephens in his then capacity as literature director of the Welsh Arts Council. The first chairman of the English language section was Glyn Jones who held the post until 1973. He was followed by Roland Mathias (1973–78), G.O. Jones (1978–81), Sam Adams (1981–84), Tony Curtis (1984–87), Gillian Clarke (1987–1993) and Sally Roberts Jones (1993–1997). The Welsh language chairmen after J. E. Caerwyn Williams were R.M.

It also administers the National Poet for Wales post (Gwyneth Lewis – 2005, Gwyn Thomas – 2006), \"Bardd Plant Cymru\" (Gwyneth Glyn); the Welsh-language Children's Laureate joint scheme between S4C, The Welsh Books Council, Literature Wales and Urdd Gobaith Cymru, and in 2005, administered the Cardiff Capital Poet project (Gillian Clarke). Managed by Literature Wales, the Glyn Jones Centre, based in the Wales Millennium Centre, provides a space for visitors and writers to gain and exchange information on the practice, publication and promotion of writing. The centre houses a large collection of Welsh-interest literature. \n\nFollowing a lottery grant from the Arts Council of Wales, Literature Wales produced The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales (published by University of Wales Press in 2008). The encyclopaedia was published in both Welsh and English and aims to combine the coverage of a gazetteer and biographical dictionary with the authority of a historical dictionary and the utility of a guide book.\n\nLiterature Wales's website provides a service as a guide to literary activity in Wales and beyond, including a database of all known writers, funding bodies, writers’ groups, publishers and periodicals currently active in Wales, listings of current poetry and story writing competitions and details of opportunities for writers. It also offers advice on getting published and publishing in general, as well as providing information on the other literature bodies and organisations in Wales.\n\nThe organisation of the awards presentation of the Academi's Wales Book of the Year competition 2008 was criticised after then Culture Minister Rhodri Glyn Thomas announced the wrong winner, although it was a simple mistake. \n\nLiterature Wales has campaigned against the Welsh Journals Online project of the National Library of Wales because it argues that authors should be paid in return for permission to allow their material to be digitised.\n\nAs a registered charity, Literature Wales is funded from public sources (largely the Arts Council of Wales, local authorities and a number of trusts), from members' subscriptions and to a lesser degree, from trading and literary activity. Its main offices are in Cardiff, sited at the Wales Millennium Centre, and there is also a small office based at Ty Newydd in Llanystumdwy in north Wales. \n\nLiterature Wales's chief executive is Lleucu Siencyn who replaces the previous chief executive, the poet and author Peter Finch.\n"}
{"id": "8606735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8606735", "title": "Los Alcornocales Natural Park", "text": "Los Alcornocales Natural Park\n\nLos Alcornocales Natural Park (in Spanish, Parque natural de Los Alcornocales) is a natural park located in the south of Spain, in the autonomous community of Andalusia; it is shared between the provinces of Cádiz and Málaga. The natural park occupies a territory spanning seventeen municipalities with a total population of about 380,000. \"Los Alcornocales\" means \"the cork oak groves\". \n\nNearly all of the uninhabited land in the park is covered by Mediterranean native forest. While some of the land has been cleared for cattle ranches, much of the human activity in the park is devoted to exploitation of the forest's resources: hunting wild game, collecting wild mushrooms, and foraging for good specimens of tree heath. \nThe tree heath (\"Erica arborea\", called \"brezos\" in Spanish) is a small evergreen shrub, rarely more than two or three meters high; it is the source of the reddish briar-root wood used in making tobacco pipes, and its wood is excellent raw material for making charcoal.\n\nAbove all, however, the park's forests are exploited for the production of cork. The cork oak (\"Quercus suber\") is a tree with a spongy layer of material lying between the outer surface of its bark and the underlying living layer called the \"phloem\" (which, in turn, encloses the non-living woody stem.) Cork is generated by a specialized layer of tissue called \"cork cambium\". Properly done, harvesting cork from a given tree can be undertaken every ten to twelve years without damaging the tree; the cork cambium simply regenerates it. Cork has many commercial uses, including wine-bottle stoppers, bulletin boards, coasters, insulation, sealing material for jar lids, flooring, gaskets for engines, fishing bobbers, handles for fishing rods and tennis rackets, etc.\n\nGiven the geographic position of Los Alcornocales, the dominant climate in the zone is, logically, Mediterranean, but a series of factors contribute to its uniqueness. Its close proximity to the sea helps keep the temperature relatively mild all year long. The average rainfall usually reaches over 800 L/m², with certain zones receiving more than 1,400 L/m² thanks to the ocean front. In the mountain ranges to the south, there are great fogs known as the \"barbas del Levante\" (the beards of the east wind). These fogs provide the humidity to form precipitation during the long dry seasons that usually characterize Mediterranean climates. The strong East wind is known as El Levante, and is associated with high temperatures. The wind from the West, which frequently brings rain, is known as El Poniente. These winds make this area one of the best places to construct wind farms in all of Spain.\n\nThe park is characterized by the most extensive forest of cork in Spain and one of the largest in the world. In contrast to the mountains of cork in other latitudes where the tree density is low, in this zone the trees form an authentic forest with a rich variety of shrub and herbaceous vegetation intimately connected. This assures a natural regeneration of the forest, a good mix of ages, and a high level of floral and animal biodiversity.\n\nForests and smaller wooded areas within the park are comprised mainly by cork oaks (\"Quercus suber\"), Portuguese oaks (\"Quercus faginea\"), Pyrenean oaks (\"Quercus pyrenaica\"), olive trees (\"Olea europaea\"), alders (\"Alnus glutinosa\"), holly trees (\"Ilex aquifolium\"), bay laurels (\"Laurus nobilis\"), rhododendrons (\"Rhododendron ponticum\"), ferns, mosses, and lichens.\n\n\nThe cork oak groves of Los Alcornocales are situated in a strategic place. They sit astride two important axes, one an east-west axis, the other north-south. The land here has allegiances to both the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea; similarly, it forms the throat of a bridge between Europe and Africa, a bridge broken only by the narrow Strait of Gibraltar. Its geographic position is the circumstance, as much as its climate, topography, or suitability for agriculture, that has dictated its patrimony.\nThe area has been populated for tens of thousands of years. This is attested by the presence of archaeological remnants of settlements by Neanderthals dating back more than thirty thousand years, as well as stone implements, engravings, and cave paintings from both the Paleolithic and Neolithic ages. Of the greatest interest to visitors, however, are the Bronze Age cave dwellings that dot the area. Of more than fifty caves discovered so far, there are three that have special artistic value: the Cueva del Tajo de las Figuras (Cave of the Figures on the Precipice), which has been compared to the Sistine Chapel among examples of cave art; the Cave of the High Laja, that houses pictures of the earliest-known boats to ply the Mediterranean; and the Cave of Bacinete, with more than a hundred pictographic representations in a magnificent state of conservation. \n\nLater in history, a succession of civilizations and cultures, one superimposed on the next, has dominated this area, all of whom have contributed to its ethnological character. Each has left its marks on the landscape; there are megalíthic monuments, Iberian, Phoenician, and Roman ruins, Arab strongholds, etc. Many of the towns that today comprise the park reached their highest state of civilization during the Muslim Nasrid dynasty, when this area was on the western fringe of the Kingdom of Granada. Today, in this area, many examples of the architecture introduced during the period of Muslim occupation survive; among them are the unique White Towns of Andalusia. Jimena de la Frontera, Castellar de la Frontera, and Medina Sidonia are magnificent examples.\n\nThe Cueva del Tajo de las Figuras, located near the town of Benalup-Casas Viejas, belongs to the group of paleolithic and neolithic sites in southern Spain that have examples of rock art that the Spanish call \"art sureño\" (southern art). In 1913, Juan Cabré and Eduardo Hernández-Pacheco began the first systematic studies of \"art sureño\" at this cave. The paintings are mostly representations of birds and odd four-footed man-like figures dating from neolithic times.\nIn 1924 the \"Cueva del Tajo de las Figuras\" was declared an Artistic Architectonic Monument by the Spanish state. For several decades, in order that visitors might better able to discern the paintings on the wall, tour guides have repeatedly sprayed water on them. This practice has resulted in the deposition of layers of lime on the paintings. Beginning in 2005, an effort to restore them was undertaken.\n\nNear the \"Cueva del Tajo de las Figuras\" was the ancient \"Laguna de la Janda\", a haven where millions of birds, both resident and migratory species, found a suitable habitat for feeding and reproduction. Unfortunately, during the middle part of the twentieth century, this important ecological niche was destroyed. To support local rice-growing, water from the lagoon and its associated fresh-water wetlands was diverted, and the area dried up almost completely. In the process, the last reproductive Spanish population of the Eurasian crane (\"Grus grus\") was lost as well.\n\nAll or part of sixteen municipalities of the Province of Cádiz lie within the Natural Park of Los Alcornocales : Alcalá de los Gazules, Algar, Algeciras, Arcos de la Frontera, Benalup-Casas Viejas, Benaocaz, Castellar de la Frontera, El Bosque, Jerez de la Frontera, Jimena de la Frontera, Los Barrios, Medina-Sidonia, Prado del Rey, San José del Valle, Tarifa and Ubrique.

Suits and sport coats are the most common garments made-to-measure. The fit of a made-to-measure garment is expected to be superior to that of a ready-to-wear garment because made-to-measure garments are constructed to fit each customer individually based on a few body measurements to customize the pre-existing pattern. \nMade-to-measure garments always involve some form of standardization in the pattern and manufacturing, whereas bespoke tailoring is entirely made from scratch based on a customer's specifications with far more attention to minute fit details and using multiple fittings during the construction process. \nAll else being equal, a made-to-measure garment will be more expensive than a ready-to-wear garment but cheaper than a bespoke one. \"Custom made\" most often refers to MTM. Country of origin makes a difference in pricing, with made in China MTM garments typically priced below made in Italy ready-to-wear.\n\nTo order a made-to-measure garment, the customer's measurements are first taken by a made-to-measure retailer. Then a base pattern is selected that most closely corresponds with the customer’s measurements. This base pattern is altered to match the customer’s measurements. The garment is constructed from this altered pattern.\n\nThe primary benefits to the customer of made-to-measure clothing are that the garments will be well-fitted to the customer's body and the customer may have the opportunity to customize the fabric and detailing. The primary disadvantage of made-to-measure is that the customer must wait up to several weeks for the garment to be sewn and delivered. A typical price markup for a made-to-measure item is 15% over the price of its ready-to-wear counterpart.\n\nMade-to-measure retailers often travel internationally meeting clients in cities, providing samples of the latest materials and styles.\n\nUnlike bespoke garments, which traditionally involves hand sewing, made-to-measure manufacturers use both machine- and hand-sewing. Made-to-measure also requires fewer fittings than bespoke, resulting in a shorter wait between customer measurement and garment delivery.\n\nMade-to-measure is sometimes also referred to as personal tailoring.\n\nIn recent years tailoring has evolved further with young companies like Artefact London, that make a blend of made-to-measure and bespoke approaches. A base pattern is used to gauge your measurements and your unique pattern is created electronically with all alterations accounted for prior to cutting. Thus alleviating the need for baste fitting that is mandatory in bespoke with very minor alterations (if any) needed at the fitting.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the legal definition of “made-to-measure” has been conflated with bespoke tailoring by a ruling of the Advertising Standards Authority. The ruling is based on the Oxford English Dictionary definition of bespoke as \"made to order\". While this ruling clarified the difference between bespoke and ready-to-wear, it had the effect of blurring the line between bespoke and made-to-measure.\n\nThe ruling established that a \"made-to-measure suit would be cut, usually by machine, from an existing pattern, and adjusted according to the customer's measurements,\" while \"a bespoke suit would be fully hand-made and the pattern cut from scratch, with an intermediary baste stage which involved a first fitting so that adjustments could be made to a half-made suit.\" The ruling concluded, however, that a \"majority of people... would not expect that bespoke suit to be fully hand-made with the pattern cut from scratch,\" effectively equalizing the terms bespoke and made-to-measure.\n\nWhile etymologist Michael Quinion observed that by definition \"it was legitimate for a tailor offering clothes cut and sewn by machine to refer to them as bespoke, provided that they were made to the customer's measurements\", since the traditional use of bespoke inside the tailoring community has been more nuanced than the Oxford definition, others concluded that the ASA \"took a rather ignorant decision to declare that there is no difference between bespoke and made-to-measure.\"\n\n"}

The usage and origins of this term are debated.\n\nThe \"old\" Leipzig School was a term used by art journalists which had become established by some time no later than 1977, and the involvement of Werner Tübke, Wolfgang Mattheuer and Bernhard Heisig with documenta 6. The students of those artists, including Sighard Gille and Arno Rink, can be seen as the second generation of the Leipzig School.\n\nThe New Leipzig School, as a third generation, relates to the post-reunification climate of modern Germany and is closely linked with the Hochschule für Grafik und Buchkunst Leipzig. It usually refers to the students of Gille and Rink, but occasionally those of Rolf Kuhrt or even Heisig or Tübke. Its works tend to be characterised by a combination of figurative and abstract elements. Clear messages, which were characteristic of the \"first\" Leipzig generation of painters, are no longer present.\n\nThe list of painters that are classified in this school is not fixed, but has included Neo Rauch, Christoph Ruckhäberle and Matthias Weischer. Others who have been associated with the term include Tim Eitel, Tilo Baumgärtel, Christian Brandl, David Schnell, Martin Kobe, Michael Triegel, Ulf Puder, Rosa Loy and Axel Krause.\n\nA significant role in the success of the \"New Leipzig School\" was played by the gallery owner Gerd Harry Lybke, who introduced the works of Rauch in particular to the globally important American art market. Other Leipzig artists were able to achieve international acclaim in the wake of this, such as the Greek-German painter Aris Kalaizis. Parallels can be seen between these successes and those of the Young British Artists. Also crucial for the Leipzig painters' success was Matthias Kleindienst, gallery owner and head of the woodcutting workshop at the Hochschule, whose search for talent paved the way for many young Leipzig artists, including Weischer. Another major factor in their market success was the \"LIGA\" art project, established in Berlin in 2002 under the direction of Christian Ehrentraut, a former collaborator with Lybke.\n\nMost of the artists tagged as \"Leipzig School\" members reject the classification. The art historical community has also consistently avoided the term on account of its vagueness and imprecision. However, it is widely used as a label and marketing tool in the world of art dealership.\n\nMany painters and galleries associated with the School are based in the \"Music District\" (\"Musikviertel\") in the south-western part of the inner city, and more recently at the Leipzig Cotton Mill in Plagwitz.\n\n"}

{"id": "15149488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15149488", "title": "Palestinian costumes", "text": "Palestinian costumes\n\nPalestinian costumes are the traditional clothing worn by Palestinians. Foreign travelers to Palestine in the 19th and early 20th centuries often commented on the rich variety of the costumes worn, particularly by the fellaheen or village women. Many of the handcrafted garments were richly embroidered and the creation and maintenance of these items played a significant role in the lives of the region's women.\n\nThough experts in the field trace the origins of Palestinian costumes to ancient times, there are no surviving clothing artifacts from this early period against which the modern items might be definitively compared. Influences from the various empires to have ruled Palestine, such as Ancient Egypt, Ancient Rome and the Byzantine empire, among others, have been documented by scholars largely based on the depictions in art and descriptions in literature of costumes produced during these times.\n\nUntil the 1940s, traditional Palestinian costumes reflected a woman's economic and marital status and her town or district of origin, with knowledgeable observers discerning this information from the fabric, colours, cut, and embroidery motifs (or lack thereof) used in the apparel.\n\nGeoff Emberling, director of the Oriental Institute Museum, notes that Palestinian clothing from the early 19th century to World War I show \"traces of similar styles of clothing represented in art over 3,000 years ago.\"\n\nHanan Munayyer, collector and researcher of Palestinian clothing, sees examples of proto-Palestinian attire in artifacts from the Canaanite period (1500 BCE) such as Egyptian paintings depicting Canaanites in A-shaped garments. Munayyer says that from 1200 BC to 1940 AD, all Palestinian dresses were cut from natural fabrics in a similar A-line shape with triangular sleeves. This shape is known to archaeologists as the \"Syrian tunic\" and appears in artifacts such as an ivory engraving from Megiddo dating to 1200 BC.\n\nIn \"Palestine: Ancient and Modern\" (1949) produced by the Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology, Winifred Needler writes that:\n\nNeedler also cites well-preserved costume artifacts from late Roman-Egyptian times consisting of \"loose linen garments with patterned woven bands of wool, shoes and sandals and linen caps,\" as comparable to modern Palestinian costumes.[6]\n\nThe shift from woven to embroidered designs was made possible by artisanal manufacture of fine needles in Damascus in the 8th century. Embroidered dress sections, like the square chest piece (qabbeh) and decorated back panel (shinyar) prevalent in Palestinian dresses, are also found in costume from 13th century Andalusia. Each village in Palestine had motifs that served as identifying markers for local women. Common patterns included the eight-pointed star, the moon, birds, palm leaves, stairs, and diamonds or triangles used as amulets to ward off the evil eye.\n\nTraditionally, Palestinian society has been divided into three groups: villagers, townspeople, and Bedouins. Palestinian costumes reflected differences in the physical and social mobility enjoyed by men and women in these different groups in Palestinian society.\n\nThe villagers, referred to in Arabic as \"fellaheen\", lived in relative isolation, so that the older, more traditional costume designs were found most frequently in the dress of village women. The specificity of local village designs was such that, \"A Palestinian woman's village could be deduced from the embroidery on her dress.\"\n\nTownspeople, (Arabic: \"beladin\") had increased access to news and an openness to outside influences that was naturally also reflected in the costumes, with town fashions exhibiting a more impermanent nature than those of the village. By the early 20th century, well to-do women (and men) in the cities had mostly adopted a Western style of dress. Typically, Ghada Karmi recalls in her autobiography how in the 1940s in the wealthy Arab district of Katamon, Jerusalem, only the maids, who were local village women, donned traditional Palestinian dresses.\n\nDue to their nomadic life-style, Bedouin costume reflected tribal affiliations, rather than their affiliations to a localized geographic area.\n\nAs in most of the Middle East, clothing for men had a more uniform style than women's clothing.\n\nWoolen fabrics for everyday use were produced by weavers in Majdal, Bethlehem, Ramallah, and Jerusalem. The wool could be from sheep, goats or camels. Weaving among the Bedouins was and is still traditionally carried out by women to create domestic items, such as tents, rugs, and pillow covers. Thread is spun from sheep's wool, colored with natural dyes, and woven into a strong fabric using a ground loom.\n\nLinen woven on hand-looms and cotton were mainstay fabrics for embroidered garments, though cotton was not widely used until the end of the 19th century when it began to be imported from Europe. Fabrics could be left uncoloured or dyed various colours, the most popular being deep blue using indigo, others being black, red and green. In 1870 there were ten dyeing workshops in the Murestan quarter of Jerusalem, employing around 100 men.\n\nAccording to Shelagh Weir, the colour produced by indigo (\"nileh\") was believed to ward off the evil eye, and frequently used for coats in the Galilee and dresses in southern Palestine. Indigo dyed heavy cotton was also used to make sirwals or shirwals, cotton trousers worn by men and women that were baggy from the waist down but tailored tight around the calves or ankles. The wealthier the region, the darker the blue produced; cloth could be dipped in the vat and left to set as many as nine times. Dresses with the heaviest and most intricate embroidery, often described as 'black', were made of heavy cotton or linen of a very dark blue. Travellers to Palestine in the 19th and 20th centuries represented pastoral scenes of peasant women donned in blue going about their daily tasks, in art and literature.\n\nBecause of the hot climate and for reasons of prestige, dresses were cut voluminously, particularly in the south, often running twice the length of the human body with the excess being wrapped up into a belt. For more festive dresses in southern Palestine, silks where imported from Syria with some from Egypt. For example, a fashion of the Bethlehem area was to interlay stripes of indigo-blue linen with those of silk.\n\nFashions in towns followed those in Damascus, Syria. Some producers in Aleppo, Hama and Damascus produced styles specifically for the Palestinian market. Weavers in Homs produced belts and some shawls exclusively for export to Nablus and Jerusalem.\n\nThe production of cloth for traditional Palestinian costumes and for export throughout the Arab world was a key industry of the destroyed village of Majdal. Majdalawi fabric was produced by a male weaver on a single treadle loom using black and indigo cotton threads combined with fuchsia and turquoise silk threads. While the village no longer exists today, the craft of Majdalawi weaving continues as part of a cultural preservation project run by the Atfaluna Crafts organization and the Arts and Crafts Village in Gaza City.\n\nDiverse motifs were favored in Palestinian embroidery and costume as Palestine's long history and position on the international trade routes exposed it to multiple influences. Before the appearance of synthetically dyed threads, the colors used were determined by the materials available for the production of natural dyes: \"reds\" from insects and pomegranate, \"dark blues\" from the indigo plant: \"yellow\" from saffron flowers, soil and vine leaves, \"brown\" from oak bark, and \"purple\" from crushed murex shells. Shahin writes that the use of red, purple, indigo blue, and saffron reflected the ancient color schemes of the Canaanite and Philistine coast, and that Islamic green and Byzantine black were more recent additions to the traditional palette. Shelagh Weir, author of Palestinian costume (1989) and Palestinian embroidery (1970), writes that cross-stitch motifs may have been derived from oriental carpets, and that couching motifs may have origins in the vestments of Christian priests or the gold thread work of Byzantium. Simple and stylized versions of the cypress tree (saru) motif are found throughout Palestine.\n\nLongstanding traditions of embroidery were found in the Upper and Lower Galilee, in the Judean Hills and on the coastal plain. Research by Weir on embroidery distribution patterns in Palestine indicates there was little history of embroidery in the area from the coast to the Jordan River that lay to the south of Mount Carmel and the Sea of Galilee and to the north of Jaffa and from Nablus to the north. Decorative elements on women's clothing in this area consisted primarily of braidwork and appliqué. \"Embroidery signifies a lack of work,\" an Arab proverb recorded by Gustaf Dalman in this area in 1937 has been put forward as a possible explanation for this regional variation.\n\nVillage women embroidering in locally-distinctive styles was a tradition that was at its height in Ottoman-ruled Palestine. Women would sew in items to represent their heritage, ancestry, and affiliations. Motifs were derived from basic geometric forms such as squares and rosettes. Triangles, used as amulets, were often incorporated to ward off the \"evil eye\", a common superstition in the Middle East. Large blocks of intricate embroidery were used on the chest panel to protect the vulnerable chest area from the evil eye, bad luck and illness. To avoid potential jinxes from other women, an imperfection was stitched in each garment to distract the focus of those looking. \n\nGirls would begin producing embroidered garments, a skill generally passed to them by their grandmothers, beginning at the age of seven. Before the 20th century, most young girls were not sent to school, and much of their time outside of household chores was spent creating clothes, often for their marriage trousseau (or \"jhaz\") which included everything they would need in terms of apparel, encompassing everyday and ceremonial dresses, jewelry, veils, headdresses, undergarments, kerchiefs, belts and footwear.\n\nIn the late 1930s, new influences introduced by European pattern books and magazines promoted the appearance of curvilinear motifs, like flowers, vines or leaf arrangements, and introduced the paired bird motif which became very popular in central Palestinian regions. John Whitting, who put together parts of the MOIFA collection, has argued that \"anything later than 1918 was not indigenous Palestinian design, but had input from foreign pattern books brought in by foreign nuns and Swiss nannies\". Others say that the changes did not set in before the late 1930s, up to which time embroidery motifs local to certain villages could still be found. Geometric motifs remained popular in the Galilee and southern regions, like the Sinai Desert.\n\nSome professions, such as the Jaffa boatmen, had their own unique uniforms. The horse or mule drivers (\"mukaaris\"), widely used between the towns in an age before proper roads, wore a short embroidered jacket with long sleeves slit open on the inside, red shoes and a small yellow woolen cap with a tight turban.\n\nThe 1948 Palestinian exodus led to a disruption in traditional modes of dress and customs, as many women who had been displaced could no longer afford the time or money to invest in complex embroidered garments. Widad Kawar was among the first to recognize the new styles developing after the Nakba.\n\nNew styles began to appear in the 1960s. For example, the \"six-branched dress\" named after the six wide bands of embroidery running down from the waist. These styles came from the refugee camps, particularly after 1967. Individual village styles were lost and replaced by an identifiable \"Palestinian\" style.\n\nThe shawal, a style popular in the West Bank and Jordan before the First Intifada, probably evolved from one of the many welfare embroidery projects in the refugee camps. It was a shorter and narrower fashion, with a western cut.\n\nIncome generating projects in the refugee camps and in the Occupied Territories began to use embroidery motifs on non-clothing items such as accessories, bags and purses. With the evolution of the different groups distinct styles are beginning to be appear. Sulafa the UNRWA project in the Gaza Strip has exhibited work at Santa Fe in America. Atfaluna, also from Gaza, working with deaf people, sells its products through the internet. West Bank groups include the Bethlehem Arabs Women's Union, Surif Women's Cooperative, Idna, the Melkite Embroidery Project (Ramallah). In Lebanon Al-Badia, working in the Refugee Camps, is known for high quality embroidery in silk thread on dresses made of linen. The Jerusalem-based Fair Trade organisation Sunbula, is working to improve the quality and presentation of items so that they can be sold in European, American and Japanese markets.\n\n\n\n\nThe women in each region had their distinctive headdress. The women embellished their headdresses with gold and silver coins from their bridewealth money. The more coins, the greater the wealth and prestige of the owner (Stillman, p. 38);\n\nThe styles of headwear for men have always been an important indicator of a man's civil and religious status as well as his political affiliation: A turban being worn by a townsman and a kaffiyeh by a countryman. A white turban signifying an Islamic judge \"qadi\". In the 1790s, the Ottoman authorities instructed the Mufti of Jerusalem, Hassan al-Husayni, to put a stop to the fashion of wearing green and white turbans which they regarded as the prerogative of officially appointed judges. In the 19th century, white turbans were also worn by supporters of the Yaman political faction, while the opposing Qais faction wore red. In 1912, the Palestine Exploration Fund reported that Muslim men from Jerusalem usually wore white linen turbans, called \"shash\". In Hebron, it would be of red and yellow silk, in Nablus red and white cotton. Men in Jaffa wore white and gold turbans, similar to the style in Damascus. A green turban indicated a descendant of Muhammed.\n\nFrom 1880 the Ottoman style of tarboush or fez began to replace the turban amongst the effendi class. The \"tarboush\" had been preceded by a rounder version with blue tassel which originated from the Magreb. The arrival of the more vertical Young Turk version was emancipating for the Christian communities since it was worn by all civil and military officials regardless of religion. The exception being the Armenians who adopted a black style.\n\nThe European styles, \"Franjy\" hat (\"burneiTah\"), were not adopted.\n\nThe kaffiyeh replaced the tarbush in the 1930s.\n\nResidents of the major towns, Jerusalem, Jaffa, Ramleh, Lydd, Hebron, Gaza and Nablus, wore soft white sheepskin shoes with the point in front turned up: low cut, not above the ankle, and yellow for men. Before the mid-19th century non-Muslims wore black shoes. Village men wore a higher style fastened at the front with a leather button which provided protection from thorns in the fields. Bedouin wore sandals, made by wandering shoemakers, usually Algerian Jews. The Arabic name for sandal, \"na'l\", is identical to that used in the Bible. On special occasions Bedouin men wore long red boots with blue tassels and iron heels, \"jizmet\", which were made in Damascus.\nExamples of Palestinian costumes and related artifacts are housed in several museums and collections, both public and private.\n\nThe following is a list of some of the public collections:\n\n\n\nA fuller bibliography can be found here: https://web.archive.org/web/20070613141917/http://www.palestinecostumearchive.org/bibliography.htm\n\nProducers:\n"}

{"id": "88470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=88470", "title": "Shada (Doctor Who)", "text": "Shada (Doctor Who)\n\nShada is an unaired serial of the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\". It was intended as the final serial of the 1979–80 season (season 17) but was never completed, owing to strike action at the BBC during filming.\n\nThe BBC released a completed version of \"Shada\" in 2017, with missing dialogue newly recorded by the original cast, using the same audio equipment employed in the initial shoot, and animated by the team that undertook the animated version of the 1966 serial \"The Power of the Daleks\".\n\nPrevious attempts to present the story include a narrated reconstruction for BBC Video; a re-imagined audio play by Big Finish Productions, also offered with basic Flash imagery on BBCi and the BBC Doctor Who website; and a novelisation by Gareth Roberts, based on the latest shooting scripts, with the author's own additions.\n\nThe Doctor answers a distress signal from Professor Chronotis, a Time Lord posing as a professor at St. Cedd's College, Cambridge who loaned a Gallifreyan tome to his student Chris Parsons. The Doctor retrieves the book while Chronotis dies after his mind was extracted by the sphere of a mad scientist named Skagra, living long enough to warn Romana, Parsons, and K9 of them and Shada. The Doctor locates Skagra's cloaked spacecraft, only for his companions to be captured while Skagra has his sphere extract the Doctor's mind to decode the book before taking Romana in the TARDIS to his carrier ship and Krarg creations. But the Doctor survived his ordeal with his mind intact and has ship's computer release Chris and K9 and take them to a space station Skagra previously occupied. The group find Skagra's discarded colleagues and learn he is after a Time Lord named Salyavin.\n\nBack on Earth, Clare Keightley accidentally revives Chronotis whose chambers are revealed as a TARDIS, the Professor explaining the book is a key to the prison planet Shada where Salyavin is held. Chronotis and Clare repair the TARDIS to reach Skagra's carrier, saving the Doctor and Chris after Skagra decoded the book and reveals his intent to absorb Salyavin's mind and use its telepathy to unite all life into a single Universal Mind. The group reach Shada as Skagra releases the prisoners, Chronotis revealed as Salyavin with Skagra extracting his mind and turning the prisoners and Chris into his thralls. Reminded that the Universal Mind contains a copy of his brain, the Doctor builds a telepathy helmet to wrestle control from Skagra while the Krarg are destroyed. Skagra ends up a prisoner in his own ship while the Doctor returns the restored prisoners to Shada and parts ways with Chronotis, musing over Chronotis' exploits being exaggerated while expecting a similar treatment within two centuries.\n\nOriginally, writer Douglas Adams presented a wholly different idea for the season's six-part finale, involving the Doctor's retirement from adventuring. Facing resistance from producer Graham Williams, Adams chose to avoid work on a replacement, under the expectation that time pressures would eventually force the producer's hand and allow his idea to be used. Ultimately, however, Williams forced Adams to conceive a new story as a last-minute replacement, which became \"Shada\".\n\nUnder its original remit, Graham Williams intended the story as a discussion about the death penalty, specifically how a civilisation like the Time Lords would deal with the issue, and treat its prisoners.\n\nAs composed by Adams, the story was scheduled to span six 25-minute episodes. Location filming in Cambridge and the first of three studio sessions at BBC Television Centre were completed as scheduled; however, when the scheduled second studio block was due to start, it fell foul of a long-running technicians' dispute at the BBC. The strike was over by the onset of rehearsals for the third recording session, but ultimately the studio time was redirected to other higher-priority Christmas programming, leaving the serial incomplete. \n\nFollowing the departure of Graham Williams from the producer role, attempts were made by new producer John Nathan-Turner to remount the story; for various reasons, however, this never transpired. Consequently, in June 1980, the production was formally dropped. It is estimated that only 50% of the story was filmed.\n\nAfter the production halt, Adams expressed a low opinion of the script and was content to let it remain obscure, turning down offers to adapt the story in various forms. He once claimed that when he had signed the contract allowing the script's 1992 release (accompanying the serial's VHS reconstruction), it had been amongst a pile of papers sent over by his agent, and that he was unaware of what he was agreeing to.\n\nIn 1983, clips from \"Shada\" were used in \"The Five Doctors\", the 20th-anniversary special. Tom Baker, the fourth actor to play the Doctor, had declined to appear in the special, and the plot was reworked to explain the events in the clips.\n\nDenis Carey was subsequently cast as the eponymous Keeper in Tom Baker's penultimate story, \"The Keeper of Traken\" (1981), and also appeared as the Borad's avatar in \"Timelash\" (1985).\n\nA decade after the serial's abandonment, John Nathan-Turner set out to complete the story in a fashion, by commissioning new effects shots and a score, and having Tom Baker record linking material to cover the missing scenes. The resulting shortened episodes (of between 14 and 22 minutes each) received a 111-minute VHS release in 1992. In its UK edition, the VHS was accompanied by a facsimile of a version of Douglas Adams's script. The release was discontinued in the UK in 1996.\n\nThis VHS reconstruction, the 2003 BBCi/Big Finish adaptation and the 1994 documentary \"More Than Thirty Years in the TARDIS\", were re-released together on DVD on 7 January 2013, as \"The Legacy Collection\" (UK) or simply \"Shada\" (North America). \n\nOn 24 November 2017, an effort to complete the serial officially, using newly recorded dialogue from the original cast (using the serial's original recording engineer and audio equipment), and new animated footage to complete the missing segments, was released as a digital download; DVD and Blu-ray releases followed on 4 December 2017 in Region 2. The new sequences were animated by the same team that undertook the 2016 animated edition of the 1966 serial \"The Power of the Daleks\", including director Charles Norton, with lead character art by Martin Geraghty, character shading by Adrian Salmon, props by Mike Collins, and background art by Daryl Joyce.\n\nA 2-disc region 1 DVD release was originally set to be made available on 9 January 2018; this was later postponed in the U.S. and Canada to 4 September 2018. The serial was released on 10 January 2018 in Region 4.\n\nThis version received its U.S. broadcast debut 19 July 2018, on BBC America, with guide data giving the episode title as \"The Lost Episode\" rather than \"Shada\".\n\nIn 2003, the BBC commissioned Big Finish Productions to remake \"Shada\" as an audio play which was then webcast in six episodic segments, accompanied by limited Flash animation, on the BBC website using illustrations provided by comic strip artist Lee Sullivan. The play starred Paul McGann as the Eighth Doctor and Lalla Ward as Romana. The audio play was also broadcast on digital radio station BBC7, on 10 December 2005 (as a 2-hour omnibus), and was repeated in six parts as the opening story to the Eighth Doctor's summer season, which began on 16 July 2006.\n\nThe webcast version (originally broadcast via BBCi's \"Red Button\") remains available from the BBC \"Doctor Who\" \"classic series\" website, and an expanded audio-only version is available for purchase on CD from Big Finish. This expanded version was the one broadcast on BBC7.\n\nTom Baker was originally approached to reprise the role of the Doctor, but declined. The Eighth Doctor was then substituted and the story reworked accordingly.\n\nPortions of the Big Finish version were reworked by Gary Russell to make the story fit into \"Doctor Who\" continuity. This included a new introduction, and a new explanation for the Fourth Doctor and Romana being \"taken out of time\" during the events of \"The Five Doctors\"; the Eighth Doctor has come to collect Romana and K9 because he has begun to have a feeling that there was something they should have done at that time.\n\nWhen Skagra is investigating the Doctor, clips from three other Big Finish productions can be heard, exclusively on the CD version – \"The Fires of Vulcan\", \"The Marian Conspiracy\" and \"Phantasmagoria\". The original serial was to have used clips from \"The Pirate Planet\" (1978), \"The Power of Kroll\" (1978–79), \"The Creature from the Pit\" (1979), \"The Androids of Tara\" (1978), \"Destiny of the Daleks\" (1979), and \"City of Death\" (1979).\n\nIn Episode 2 of the webcast version, when Chris is in his lab showing Clare the book, a vending machine-like object in the background is labelled \"Nutrimat\", a reference to a similar device in Adams' \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\". Two other references are a sequence where Skagra steals a Ford Prefect and when images of \"Hitchhiker's Guide\" characters appear as inmates on Shada itself.\n\nIn 2010, Ian Levine funded an unofficial project to complete the original \"Shada\" story using animation and the original voice actors, minus Tom Baker and David Brierley, to complete the parts of the story that were never filmed. John Leeson would replace Brierley as the voice of K9, and Paul Jones (better known as a studio carpenter) would replace Tom Baker as the Doctor. The completed story was finished in late 2011 and announced by Levine, via his Twitter account, on 8 September 2011. J. R. Southall, writer for the science fiction magazine \"Starburst\", reviewed Levine's completed version and scored it 10 out of 10 in an article published on 15 September 2011. The completed Levine version appeared on torrent sites over two years later, on 12 October 2013.\n\nElements of the story were reused by Douglas Adams for his novel \"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency\", in particular the character of Professor Chronotis who possesses a time machine. Adams did not allow \"Shada\", or any of his other \"Doctor Who\" stories, to be novelised by Target Books. It is, therefore, one of only five serials from the 1963–1989 series not to be novelised by Target – along with Adams' other stories \"The Pirate Planet\" and \"City of Death\", plus Eric Saward's two Dalek stories (\"Resurrection of the Daleks\" and \"Revelation of the Daleks\").\n\nA six-part adaptation of the story by Jonathan V Way appeared in issues 13–18 of \"Cosmic Masque\", the Doctor Who Appreciation Society's fiction magazine. Adams granted permission for the adaptation on condition that it was never published in collected form.\n\nBBC Books published a novelisation of this serial on 15 March 2012, written by Gareth Roberts. Roberts drew on the latest versions of the scripts available, as well as adding new material of his own to \"fix\" various plotholes and unanswered questions. Nicholas Pegg, in his review of the book for \"Doctor Who Magazine\" heartily praised it, calling it a \"successful duet\".\n\nLalla Ward delivered an 11hr 30min unabridged reading of the Gareth Roberts novelisation for AudioGo; joining her, voicing K9, was John Leeson. The audio recording was released on 15 March 2012, and is available for download or on 10 CDs (CD , Download ). Vanessa Bishop reviewed it favourably for \"Doctor Who Magazine\", singling out Simon E Power's sound design for special praise.\n\nPaul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping gave the serial (at the time in the form of the 1992 VHS reconstruction) a mixed review in \"The Discontinuity Guide\" (1995), saying; \n\nPatrick Mulkern reviewed the 2017 partially reconstructed version for \"Radio Times\". Mulkern thought that despite \"pockets of magic to enjoy\" it was a \"sprawling but far-from-epic serial.\" The humour was repetitive and fell flat and the action pedestrian. Mulkern recommended Gareth Roberts' novelisation as a superior alternative.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "463721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=463721", "title": "Space group", "text": "Space group\n\nIn mathematics, physics and chemistry, a space group is the symmetry group of a configuration in space, usually in three dimensions. In three dimensions, there are 219 distinct types, or 230 if chiral copies are considered distinct. Space groups are also studied in dimensions other than 3 where they are sometimes called Bieberbach groups, and are discrete cocompact groups of isometries of an oriented Euclidean space.\n\nIn crystallography, space groups are also called the crystallographic or Fedorov groups, and represent a description of the symmetry of the crystal. A definitive source regarding 3-dimensional space groups is the \"International Tables for Crystallography\" ().\n\nSpace groups in 2 dimensions are the 17 wallpaper groups which have been known for several centuries, though the proof that the list was complete was only given in 1891, after the much harder case of space groups had been done.\n\nIn 1879 Leonhard Sohncke listed the 65 space groups (called Sohncke groups) whose elements preserve the orientation. More accurately, he listed 66 groups, but Fedorov and Schönflies both noticed that two of them were really the same. The space groups in 3 dimensions were first enumerated by (whose list had 2 omissions (I3d and Fdd2) and one duplication (Fmm2)), and shortly afterwards were independently enumerated by (whose list had 4 omissions (I3d, Pc, Cc, ?) and one duplication (P2m)). The correct list of 230 space groups was found by 1892 during correspondence between Fedorov and Schönflies. later enumerated the groups with a different method, but omitted four groups (Fdd2, I2d, P2d, and P2c) even though he already had the correct list of 230 groups from Fedorov and Schönflies; the common claim that Barlow was unaware of their work is a myth.\n\nThe space groups in three dimensions are made from combinations of the 32 crystallographic point groups with the 14 Bravais lattices, each of the latter belonging to one of 7 lattice systems. This results in a space group being some combination of the translational symmetry of a unit cell including lattice centering, the point group symmetry operations of reflection, rotation and improper rotation (also called rotoinversion), and the screw axis and glide plane symmetry operations. The combination of all these symmetry operations results in a total of 230 different space groups describing all possible crystal symmetries.\n\nThe elements of the space group fixing a point of space are the identity element, reflections, rotations and improper rotations.\n\nThe translations form a normal abelian subgroup of rank 3, called the Bravais lattice. There are 14 possible types of Bravais lattice. The quotient of the space group by the Bravais lattice is a finite group which is one of the 32 possible point groups. Translation is defined as the face moves from one point to another point.\n\nA glide plane is a reflection in a plane, followed by a translation parallel with that plane. This is noted by \"a\", \"b\" or \"c\", depending on which axis the glide is along. There is also the \"n\" glide, which is a glide along the half of a diagonal of a face, and the \"d\" glide, which is a fourth of the way along either a face or space diagonal of the unit cell. The latter is called the diamond glide plane as it features in the diamond structure. In 17 space groups, due to the centering of the cell, the glides occur in two perpendicular directions simultaneously, \"i.e.\" the same glide plane can be called \"b\" or \"c\", \"a\" or \"b\", \"a\" or \"c\". For example, group Abm2 could be also called Acm2, group Ccca could be called Cccb. In 1992, it was suggested to use symbol \"e\" for such planes. The symbols for five space groups have been modified:\nA screw axis is a rotation about an axis, followed by a translation along the direction of the axis. These are noted by a number, \"n\", to describe the degree of rotation, where the number is how many operations must be applied to complete a full rotation (e.g., 3 would mean a rotation one third of the way around the axis each time). The degree of translation is then added as a subscript showing how far along the axis the translation is, as a portion of the parallel lattice vector. So, 2 is a twofold rotation followed by a translation of 1/2 of the lattice vector.\n\nThe general formula for the action of an element of a space group is\n\n\"y\" = \"M\".\"x\" + \"D\"\n\nwhere \"M\" is its matrix, \"D\" is its vector, and where the element transforms point \"x\" into point \"y\". In general, \"D\" = \"D\"(lattice) + \"D\"(\"M\"), where \"D\"(\"M\") is a unique function of \"M\" that is zero for \"M\" being the identity. The matrices \"M\" form a point group that is a basis of the space group; the lattice must be symmetric under that point group.\n\nThe lattice dimension can be less than the overall dimension, resulting in a \"subperiodic\" space group. For (overall dimension, lattice dimension):\n\nThere are at least ten methods of naming space groups. Some of these methods can assign several different names to the same space group, so altogether there are many thousands of different names.\n\n\n\nThere are (at least) 10 different ways to classify space groups into classes. The relations between some of these are described in the following table. Each classification system is a refinement of the ones below it.\n\nIn \"n\" dimensions, an affine space group, or Bieberbach group, is a discrete subgroup of isometries of \"n\"-dimensional Euclidean space with a compact fundamental domain. proved that the subgroup of translations of any such group contains \"n\" linearly independent translations, and is a free abelian subgroup of finite index, and is also the unique maximal normal abelian subgroup. He also showed that in any dimension \"n\" there are only a finite number of possibilities for the isomorphism class of the underlying group of a space group, and moreover the action of the group on Euclidean space is unique up to conjugation by affine transformations. This answers part of Hilbert's eighteenth problem. showed that conversely any group that is the extension of Z by a finite group acting faithfully is an affine space group. Combining these results shows that classifying space groups in \"n\" dimensions up to conjugation by affine transformations is essentially the same as classifying isomorphism classes for groups that are extensions of Z by a finite group acting faithfully.\n\nIt is essential in Bieberbach's theorems to assume that the group acts as isometries; the theorems do not generalize to discrete cocompact groups of affine transformations of Euclidean space. A counter-example is given by the 3-dimensional Heisenberg group of the integers acting by translations on the Heisenberg group of the reals, identified with 3-dimensional Euclidean space. This is a discrete cocompact group of affine transformations of space, but does not contain a subgroup Z.\n\nThis table gives the number of space group types in small dimensions, including the numbers of various classes of space group. The numbers of enantiomorphic pairs are given in parentheses.\na - Trivial group <BR>\nb - One is the group of integers and the other is the infinite dihedral group; see symmetry groups in one dimension <BR>\nc - these 2D space groups are also called wallpaper groups or plane groups. <BR>\nd - In 3D there are 230 crystallographic space group types, which reduces to 219 affine space group types because of some types being different from their mirror image; these are said to differ by \"enantiomorphous character\" (e.g. P312 and P312). Usually \"space group\" refers to 3D. They were enumerated independently by , and . <BR>\ne - The 4895 4-dimensional groups were enumerated by . corrected the number of enantiomorphic groups from 112 to 111, so total number of groups is 4783+111=4894. There are 44 enantiomorphic point groups in 4-dimensional space. If we consider enantiomorphic groups as different, the total number of point groups is 227+44=271. <BR>\nf - enumerated the ones of dimension 5. counted the enantiomorphs. <BR>\ng - enumerated the ones of dimension 6, later the corrected figures were found. Initially published number of 826 Lattice types in was corrected to 841 in . See also . counted the enantiomorphs, but that paper relied on old erroneous CARAT data for dimension 6.\n\nIn addition to crystallographic space groups there are also magnetic space groups (also called two-color (black and white) crystallographic groups or Shubnikov groups). These symmetries contain an element known as time reversal. They treat time as an additional dimension, and the group elements can include time reversal as reflection in it. They are of importance in magnetic structures that contain ordered unpaired spins, i.e. ferro-, ferri- or antiferromagnetic structures as studied by neutron diffraction. The time reversal element flips a magnetic spin while leaving all other structure the same and it can be combined with a number of other symmetry elements. Including time reversal there are 1651 magnetic space groups in 3D . It has also been possible to construct magnetic versions for other overall and lattice dimensions (Daniel Litvin's papers, , ). Frieze groups are magnetic 1D line groups and layer groups are magnetic wallpaper groups, and the axial 3D point groups are magnetic 2D point groups. Number of original and magnetic groups by (overall, lattice) dimension:\n\nTable of the wallpaper groups using the classification of the 3-dimensional space groups:\n\nFor each geometric class, the possible arithmetic classes are\n\nNote. An \"e\" plane is a double glide plane, one having glides in two different directions. They are found in seven orthorhombic, five tetragonal and five cubic space groups, all with centered lattice. The use of the symbol \"e\" became official with .\n\nThe lattice system can be found as follows. If the crystal system is not trigonal then the lattice system is of the same type. If the crystal system is trigonal, then the lattice system is hexagonal unless the space group is one of the seven in the rhombohedral lattice system consisting of the 7 trigonal space groups in the table above whose name begins with R. (The term rhombohedral system is also sometimes used as an alternative name for the whole trigonal system.) The hexagonal lattice system is larger than the hexagonal crystal system, and consists of the hexagonal crystal system together with the 18 groups of the trigonal crystal system other than the seven whose names begin with R.\n\nThe Bravais lattice of the space group is determined by the lattice system together with the initial letter of its name, which for the non-rhombohedral groups is P, I, F, or C, standing for the principal, body centered, face centered, or C-face centered lattices.\n\n\n"}

The tour promoter makes an offer of employment to a particular artist, usually through the artist’s agent or music manager. The promoter and agent then negotiate the live performance contract. The majority of live performance contracts are drawn up using the American Federation of Musicians (AFM) standard contract format known as the \"AFM Performance Agreement\".\n\nIncluded among the tour promoter’s various job responsibilities are: (1) obtaining venue, concert hall, theater, nightclub or arena bookings; (2) pricing the event or tour; and (3) providing air, sea or land transportation (optional). However the promoter must have upfront cash and or sponsorship financing to pay for advertising the tours of the artists. Such advertising costs, usually referred to as a Media or Promotional Kit, commonly include television and radio advertisements, posters, newspaper and magazine adverts, online marketing and so on.\n\nThere are no figures available concerning how much an average concert promoter makes annually. Like most music industry professions, compensation depends on the level of success possessed by the artist the promoter works with, location, and what a given market will bear. The promoter assumes all the financial risk in putting on a show, so compensation also depends on how successful the promoter is at negotiating with vendors and creating sold-out shows. Additionally, in-depth knowledge of their operating market and audience characteristics are critical success factors for any tour promoter.\n\nThe rise of large corporation mega-promoters over the past ten years has made it much more difficult for aspiring tour promoters to break into the industry. Live Nation (previously known as Clear Channel Entertainment) is the number one concert promoter in the world according to figures released by \"Pollstar Magazine\" in 2006. The Beverly Hills, California-based corporation accounted for about $1.3 billion in concert box-office sales during 2005, according to Billboard magazine's tracking. Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG Live) was ranked second with $417 million, followed by House of Blues (HOB Entertainment) at number three with $245 million. On July 5, 2006, Live Nation purchased HOB Entertainment for $350 million, further expanding their market share in the live-music business.\n\nWhile average ticket prices jumped to roughly $57 in 2005, the number of tickets sold for the 100 biggest tours dipped 3.5%, to 36.3 million. Some fans have complained to government officials, particularly after they found tickets to the same concerts or sporting events available - sometimes at many times the face value - on secondary sellers like Stubhub.com and TicketsNow minutes after the public sale began. After hearing from some would-be ticket buyers, the Missouri attorney general announced the state was suing three ticket resellers on charges they violated state consumer protection laws. That same day, the Arkansas attorney general said he was seeking documents from five resellers. And the attorney general’s office in Pennsylvania is also looking into the ticket sale business after receiving several hundred complaints over the recent sale of tickets for a Hannah Montana concert in Pittsburgh.\n\nOn December 21, 2007, Live Nation announced it would acquire the software and services to ramp up its ticket-selling operation, potentially positioning the company to compete directly with its longtime contractor, Ticketmaster.\n\nLive Nation, the largest concert promoter, and Ticketmaster Entertainment, the No. 1 ticket seller, announced merger on February 10, 2009. Then on January 25, 2010 the U.S. Department of Justice approved the merger with terms that include that Ticketmaster sell Paciolan, its ticketing and software services unit, to Comcast's sports and entertainment firm or \"another buyer suitable to the department.\"\n\nTicketmaster must also license its software to Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG), the company’s largest customer. With a copy of the Ticketmaster software, AEG will be able to market an attractive ticketing system to venues, according to the DOJ; under the settlement terms, both companies will be able to compete head-to-head with Ticketmaster.\n\nColleges can provide \"dedicated fans, an excellent testing ground, eager workers, [and] loyal fans.\" The college market provides a network of new potential fans that artists, labels, agents, and managers could focus on for promotion. The major record labels have departments dedicated to college promotion and hire students as representatives for all the artists on these labels. Sony Music Entertainment has a college marketing department, which promotes records released by Sony and by their independent label affiliates. Other music marketing companies such as Cornerstone Promotion focus on college marketing. Cornerstone Promotion hires representatives from colleges all around the country to implement small scale marketing campaigns on their campuses. \nArtists began breaking into the college market in the 1990s. Billboard Magazine published articles dating back to the early-mid nineties urging artists and agents to take advantage of the college market. Artists such as Dave Matthews Band and R.E.M. played college shows to increase their presence in the college market in the nineties. Billboard Magazine has emphasized the extent to which college concerts can help an artist in multiple articles.\n\nThere are numerous degree programs and academic courses focusing on concert promotion and venue management. Some of these are full degree programs, while others are certificates offered for post-graduate studies. For example, New York University offers a Certificate in Meeting, Conference, and Event Management, and a Certificate in Sports Marketing.\n\n\n"}

Boll was the co-executive producer of the 2005 Academy Award-winning documentary, \"Born Into Brothels\". \n\nThe film follows five diverse women artists; Maye Torres, Mayumi Oda, Camille Musser, Angela Williams and Janice Mars Wunderlich, ranging in age from 27 to 65 from all over the United States as they chart a path to create their individual type of art while balancing the demands of motherhood and societal expectations. By following the lives of these five artists, the film explores the intersections of motherhood and creativity, partnering and independence, economics and art, parenting and work. \"Who Does She Think She Is?\" looks at “the under-representation of mothers in the arts and other creative fields.”\n\nIn an interview with \"The Wall Street Journal\", Boll says that a main theme connecting the women was the “idea of giving yourself permission to do that work you’re called to do.” According to \"The New York Times\", the film “provides a nuanced look at the sacrifices and challenges facing female artists who become mothers.”\n\nMaye Torres, a full time multimedia artist. She lives and works in Taos, New Mexico and Venice Beach, California. She is the mother of three sons; Isaiah, a glass artist and musician; Zach, an accomplished pianist and composer; and Matthias, PhD candidate in Chemical Engineering Univ. of Florida, Gainesville. Her career spans 37 years and her award-winning work is in public and private collections throughout the world.\n\nAngela Williams, an actress and extraordinary singer. Mother of two daughters.\n\nCamille Musser, a gifted painter and mother of two, Musser founded the Youlou Arts Foundation. \n\nMayumi Oda, a print maker, activist and mother of two, was born in Japan. Oda’s art focuses primarily on goddess imagery.\n\nJanis Wunderlich, a sculptor, mother of five, and full time working artist. Wunderlich creates fairytale-esque creatures out of clay.\n\nOne critic has stated, \"It’s not every documentary that compels me to stay up writing most of the night and that weighs heavily on my mind for days. But, then again, \"Who Does She Think She Is?\" is not your average documentary.\"\n\nThere have been more mixed reviews, one magazine saying that the film has “revelatory moments” but also provides too restrictive a definition of “artist” and at times was “clumsily” composed.\n\n\"The New York Times\" called the film an answer to the call of “self-expression in the face of biological imperatives and cultural programming.” \"The Village Voice\" has called it “a call to arms.”. According to \"The Huffington Post\", despite the films feminist stance, it produces and engaging story.\n\n"}
