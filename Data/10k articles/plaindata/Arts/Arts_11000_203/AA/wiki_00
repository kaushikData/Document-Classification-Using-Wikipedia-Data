Directed by Philip Lyall and Nimisha Mukerji, it follows Markvoort as she lives her life undaunted by her disease, waiting for a lung transplant while blogging about her experiences.\n\nThe film began when Philip Lyall, a long-time friend of Markvoort, introduced her to his University of British Columbia film school partner Nimisha Mukerji. Lyall and Mukerji had been looking for a post-graduation project and decided to chronicle Markvoort's wait for a double-lung transplant. They named the film \"65_Redroses\" after Eva's online identity, which she had chosen because, according to the Canadian cystic fibrosis community, \"sixty-five roses\" is how many young children with the disease mispronounce \"cystic fibrosis\". Eva added 'red' because it was her favourite colour.\n\nWhen Lyall and Mukerji began shooting, Markvoort's lungs were so clogged doctors said that without a transplant, she would not live to 2009. She was getting ready to visit a pumpkin patch the week before Halloween in 2007, when her pager went off, a signal to call the hospital transplant center. A pair of lungs was available for transplant. This sequence, emotional for both Markvoort and the filmmakers, was instrumental in attracting the attention and backing of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\n\"65_Redroses\" premiered at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival and won three awards at the Vancouver International Film Festival, including most popular Canadian film and documentary. It debuted on television on CBC's \"The Passionate Eye\" series and was acquired by the Public Broadcasting Service for international distribution.\n\nOn November 16, 2010, it was announced that \"65_Redroses\" had been acquired by the Oprah Winfrey Network and would premiere in the United States in early 2011.\n\nHello Cool World is the distributor of the film in Canada.\n\n"}

It usually contained water for the washing of hands (\"aqua\" + \"manos\") over a basin, which was part of both upper-class meals and the Christian Eucharist. Historically the term was sometimes used for any shape of basin or ewer so used, regardless of shape. Most surviving examples are in metal, typically copper alloys (brass or bronze), as pottery versions have rarely survived.\n\nPersian aquamaniles predate any zoomorphic aquamaniles known in Europe. An Iranian (Abbasid caliphate), Aquamanile in the form of an eagle, bearing the date 180 AH/CE 796-797, of bronze, inlaid with silver and copper, in the State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, is the earliest dated Islamic object in metalwork. Among the latest in date is one also at the State Hermitage Museum, a late Islamic aquamanile from Khorasan, dated 1206. Islamic law deprecated the use of such representational figures, and the Islamic zoomorphic aquamanile tradition died out.\n\nHowever the tradition was taken up enthusiastically in Europe, where the form remained popular until the Renaissance.\n\nThe Byzantine Empire's cultural connections with Sassanid Persia and the Abbasid caliphate, never peaceful in the political sphere, nevertheless brought the aquamanile into the Christian Mediterranean world. The earliest European portable aquamaniles date to the eleventh century.\nEwers and basins were needed in Christian liturgy for the ritual of the lavabo, in which the officiating priest washes his hands before vesting, again before the consecration of the Eucharist and after mass. As a ritual object, metal was considered more suitable than pottery, although most examples in pottery no doubt were broken and discarded. The aquamaniles made in the Mosan – or Meuse valley – region, using the brass alloy of silvery tint called \"dinanderie\" (from the center of its manufacture in the region of Dinant) were often fantastic and zoomorphic in their forms, which were constrained only by the need for a larger opening for filling the vessel and a spout for pouring. Church records inventory aquamaniles in silver or gilt copper, but the great majority of surviving examples are in base metals, which were not worth melting down.\n\nAs well as the altar, aquamaniles were used at the tables of the great, where extravagant designs of symbolic or fantastical beasts – lions were especially popular – were developed in purely secular iconography. A gold aquamanile, c. 1215, in the treasury of the cathedral at Aachen, takes the form of a man's bust; it is a rare survival of an aquamanile in a precious metal. An aquamanile (ref. Metropolitan Museum) in the form of Aristotle on hands and knees, being ridden by Phyllis, bore several moral lessons, with ribald undertones; such an aquamanile was distinctly secular in nature.\n\nBronze aquamaniles in the form of leopards were part of court ritual in Benin, where the concept may have arrived from the Islamic north. An 18th-century bronze leopard aquamanile from Benin is in the collection of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.\n\nFrom the Renaissance elaborate versions of the conventional ewer were preferred to zoomorphic forms. A late version of the aquamanile was the silver-gilt mounted rider on a stand, bought in 1700 for the treasury of the Basilica of St-Denis and sold in 1798. Its form is recorded in an engraving by Félibien. (ref. St-Denis) The idea of ewers in fantastic shapes has never died out.\n\nThe following aquamanilia in public collections are set in approximate chronological order:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Balachander, starring Prameela, Sivakumar, S. V. Subbaiah, Kamal Haasan and M. N. Rajam in prominent roles. The film marked Kamal Haasan's first adult role, while, along with Prameela, Jayachitra, Jayasudha, Sashikumar and Achacho Chitra made their debuts in Tamil cinema. V. Kumar composed the music for the film, which was the last Balachander film he worked on.\n\nThe film told the story of a young woman who is forced to become a prostitute to support her conservative, but extremely poor Brahmin family. It carried hard hitting messages and very bold scenes and was controversial at the time of its release, but became a commercial hit. The film was featured as part of the Tamil Nadu government's information campaign promoting family planning.\n\nLalitha is the eldest daughter of a pious and conservative Brahmin family. She has eight siblings and poverty reigns. Her aunt comes with her unmarried daughter and starts living with them. They are spendthrifts and create lots of problems. One day Thangavelu presents Lalitha a saree when he sees her with a torn saree. Her father gets angry and gives the saree to the mentally unstable Thangam, who roams around the village. When Thangavelu's father scolds Thangavelu for gifting a saree, he fights and leaves home to join the army. Later they come to know that Thangavelu is dead. Lalitha's father goes out of town to search for a groom. That night all the children sit down to eat. Her mom ask her to tell the kids there is no food. She presents a tongue-twister to the kids and everyone understands no food was cooked. That's when Lalitha realises in what poor state her home is. She decides to take up the family mantle and goes to work. She starts work as office help. She travels to Madras to meet a politician for requesting her brothers medicine seat. She was advised to go home. Another person promises to get a seat for her brother, but forces her into something else. She tries to commit suicide, but drops it when she talks with her brother. She leaves to Hyderabad with a promotion. Due to family needs and ill fate, she ends up as a prostitute, but manages to settle all her brothers and sisters. When she returns home for a visit, her mother realises something is different with Lalitha. when Kamal's marriage with the local girl is fixed, her aunt makes trouble and spreads the truth with all. Her aunt wanted to marry her daughter to Kamal. Her family ditches her when they come to know about her dark side. Thangavelu, a man who was once rejected by her marries her. She keeps calling Thangam to inform her that she got married making the audience believe she has lost her sanity in the end.\n\n\nT. S. B. K. Moulee in an interview in 2014 told that Balachander, who used to watch Moulee's plays, wanted him to write a comedy track for the film as he liked Moulee's style of writing. Moulee, however, felt that the film did not warrant any separate comedy as it would \"dilute its seriousness\" and did not work on the film.\n\n\"Arangetram\"'s music was composed by V. Kumar. It marks the last collaboration between Kumar and Balachander. Kannadasan had written the lyrics.\n\nBalachander remade this film in Hindi as \"Aaina\", with Mumtaz playing the lead, supported by Rajesh Khanna and Kamal Hassan. This was Kamal Haasan's first Hindi film. Later he was launched as a leading actor with \"Ek Duuje Ke Liye\", by K. Balachander.\n\nIn Telugu it was remade as Jeevitha Rangamu. Rama Sarma, head of the family is Gummadi and his wife is by Savithri. Main lead role is once again played by Prameela. Other artistes include Jayasidha, Phataphat Jayalakshmi, Lakshmikanth, Chalam, S. V. Rangarao and Ravi Kondalarao. Music was composed by S. Rajeswara Rao.

Arthur Garner was articled to Charles J. Phipps, the architect, whose connection was largely theatrical, he having erected no less than forty English theatres; from which circumstance may perhaps be traced the young pupil's gravitation to the stage, where he became a \"protégé\" of Mr. George Gordon, the scenic artist. From the paint-room Garner soon found his way to the footlights, and for some time appeared in various provincial companies.\n\nIn 1873 Garner arrived in Melbourne, returning to London in 1876. In 1879 Garner began his career as an Australian entrepreneur by taking out \"The London Comedy Company\" (1879), of which Fred Marshall was the bright particular comic star and Mr. George Gordon the hardly less indispensable scenic artist. Garner opened Garner's Theatre (previously White's Rooms) in Adelaide in 1880.\nIn 1881 Garner joined J. C. Williamson, the eminent Australian-American actor, and George Musgrove in establishing the leading firm of Australasian managers, generally known as the \"Trio,\" which has controlled a greater number of theatres and entered into engagements, dramatic and operatic, on a larger scale than has ever been attempted in the southern hemisphere. Their operations practically commenced at the Theatre Royal, Melbourne, on July 1, 1882, with the production of Gilbert and Sullivan's \"Patience\". Many eminent London \"artistes\" were introduced to the colonies under their regime; but the most substantial undertaking of Williamson, Garner & Musgrove was the building of the new Princess's Theatre, Melbourne, in 1886, regarded as one of the finest theatres in the world.\n\nGarner was twice married: first, to the noted English actress Blanche Stammers, who died in Melbourne in 1883; and, secondly, to Letitia Hill Martin, sister of Patchett Martin, herself an accomplished \"littérateur\", and formerly a contributor to the Australian press.\n\nThey retired to England, living at 36 Kempshott-road, Streatham Common, Surrey.

{"id": "391167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=391167", "title": "Curator", "text": "Curator\n\nA curator (from , meaning \"to take care\") is a manager or overseer. Traditionally, a curator or keeper of a cultural heritage institution (e.g., gallery, museum, library, or archive) is a content specialist charged with an institution's collections and involved with the interpretation of heritage material.\n\nA traditional curator's concern necessarily involves tangible objects of some sort — artwork, collectibles, historic items, or scientific collections. More recently, new kinds of curators have started to emerge: curators of digital data objects and biocurators.\n\nIn smaller organizations, a curator may have sole responsibility for acquisitions and even for collections care. The curator makes decisions regarding what objects to select, oversees their potential and documentation, conducts research based on the collection and its history, provides proper packaging of art for transportation, and shares research with the public and community through exhibitions and publications. In very small, volunteer-based museums such as those of local historical societies, a curator may be the only paid staff-member.\n\nIn larger institutions, the curator's primary function is that of a subject specialist, with the expectation that he or she will conduct original research on objects and guide the organization in its collecting. Such institutions can have multiple curators, each assigned to a specific collecting area (e.g., curator of ancient art, curator of prints and drawings, etc.) and often operating under the direction of a head curator. In such organizations, the physical care of the collection may be overseen by museum collections-managers or by museum conservators, with documentation and administrative matters (such as personnel, insurance, and loans) handled by a museum registrar.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the term \"curator\" also applies to government employees who monitor the quality of contract archaeological work under Planning Policy Guidance 16: Archaeology and Planning (PPG 16) and manage the cultural resource of a region. In the museum setting, a curator in the United Kingdom may also be called a \"keeper\".\n\nIn Scotland, the term \"curator\" is also used to mean the guardian of a child, known as curator \"ad litem\".\n\nIn the US, curators have multifaceted tasks dependent on the particular institution and its mission. But in recent years the role of the curator has evolved alongside the changing role of museums. As US museums have become increasingly more digitized, curators find themselves constructing narratives in both the material and digital worlds. Historian Elaine Gurian has called for museums in which \"visitors could comfortably search for answers to their own questions regardless of the importance placed on such questions by others\". This would change the role of curator from teacher to \"facilitator and assistor\". In this sense, the role of curator in the United States is precarious, as digital and interactive exhibits often allow members of the public to become their own curators, and to choose their own information. Citizens are then able to educate themselves on the specific subject they are interested in, rather than spending time listening to information they have no desire to learn.\n\nMore recently, advances in new technologies have led to a further widening of the role of curator. This has been a focus in major art institutions internationally and has become an object of academic study and research.\n\nIn contemporary art, the title \"curator\" identifies a person who selects and often interprets works of art. In addition to selecting works, the curator is often responsible for writing labels, catalog essays, and other content supporting exhibitions. Such curators may be permanent staff members, \"guest curators\" from an affiliated organization or university, or \"freelance curators\" working on a consultancy basis. The late-20th century saw an explosion of artists organizing exhibitions. The artist-curator has a long tradition of influence, notably featuring Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723-1792), inaugural president of the Royal Academy of Arts, London, founded in 1768.\n\nIn some US cultural organizations, the term \"curator\" may designate the head of any given division. This has led to the proliferation of titles such as \"Curator of Education\" and \"Curator of Exhibitions\". The term \"literary curator\" has been used to describe persons who work in the field of poetry, such as former 92nd Street Y poetry-director Karl Kirchwey. This trend has increasingly been mirrored in the United Kingdom in such institutions as Ikon, Birmingham, UK and Baltic, Gateshead, UK.\n\nIn Australia and New Zealand the term also applies to a person who prepares a sports ground for use (especially a cricket ground). This job is equivalent to that of groundsman in some other cricketing nations.\n\nIn France, the term curator is translated as \"conservateur\". There are two kinds of curators: heritage curators (\"conservateurs du patrimoine\") with five specialities (archeology, archives, museums, historical monuments, natural science museums), and librarian curators (\"conservateurs des bibliothèques\"). These curators are selected by competitive examination and attend the INP (Institut National du Patrimoine). The \"conservateurs du patrimoine\" are civil servants or work in the public service; the use of the title by private workers is not possible.\n\nCurators hold a high academic degree in their subject, typically a Doctor of Philosophy or a master's degree in subjects such as history, history of art, art, archaeology, anthropology, or classics. Curators are also expected to have contributed to their academic field, for example, by delivering public talks, publishing articles, or presenting at specialist academic conferences. It is important that curators have knowledge of the current collecting market for their area of expertise, and are aware of current ethical practices and laws that may impact their organisation's collecting.\n\nThe increased complexity of many museums and cultural organisations has prompted the emergence of professional programs in fields such as public history, public humanities, museum studies, arts management, and curating/curatorial practice. In 1992, the Royal College of Art established an MA course co-funded by the Royal College of Art and the Arts Council of Great Britain, the first in Britain to specialise in curating with a particular focus on contemporary art. The course is now funded by Arts Council England, and in 2001 the course title was amended to Curating Contemporary Art to more accurately reflect the content and primary focus of the programme. Similarly, a number of contemporary art institutions launched curatorial study courses as an alternative to traditional academic programs. Established in 1987, the École du Magasin is a curatorial training program based at the art center Le Magasin in Grenoble, France. Similarly, the Whitney Museum of American Art, through its independent study program, hosts a curatorial program as one of its three study areas, and de Appel arts centre has hosted a curatorial programme since 1994. Other institutions that run programs in curating include Norwich University of the Arts; The Courtauld Institute of Art, London, UK, Kingston University; Goldsmiths, University of London; Birkbeck, University of London; Chelsea College of Arts; University of the Arts London; California College of the Arts; University of Southern California; Bard College; School of Visual Arts; the École du Louvre; the Institut national du patrimoine (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage), University of Rennes 2—Upper Brittany; OCAD University; and University of Melbourne. (See \"→External links\" for further information on courses.)\n\nCommunity curation - alternately known as public curation - is a movement in US museums and public humanities organizations to involve community members in various curatorial processes, including exhibit development and programming. Community members involved in community curation are likely not trained as museum professionals, but have vested interests in the outcomes of curatorial projects. Community curation is a response to the 19th century “information transmission” model of learning, in which museums are sources of expert knowledge and visitors are the recipients of that expertise. Community curation seeks not to abandon expertise, but to broaden definitions of expertise to “include broader domains of experience” that visitors bring to museums. \n\nCommunity curation practices are varied. The Wing Luke Museum conducts community outreach at the beginning of exhibition projects, and convenes community advisory committees at various stages in the curatorial process. The Brooklyn Historical Society has accepted exhibit proposals from community members and trained them in curatorial skills to co-create exhibits. Such efforts to allow communities to participate in curation can require \"\"more\" not less expertise from museum staff.\" \n\nIn the same way that a museum curator may acquire objects of relevance or an art curator may select or interpret a work of art, the injection of technology and impact of social media into every aspect of society has seen the emergence of technology curators.\n\nTechnology curators are people who are able to disentangle the science and logic of a particular technology and apply it to real world situations and society, whether it is for social change, commercial advantage, or other purposes. The first UK \"Wired\" Conference had a test lab, where an independent curator selected technology that showcased radical technology advancements and their impact on society, such as the ability to design and \"print\" physical objects using 3D printers (such as a fully working violin) or the ability to model and represent accurate interactive medical and molecular models in stereoscopic 3D. \n\nMLOVE, a Confestival started in 2010, celebrated the disruption of the perception of what a tech conference should be, using a radically more interactive format that drew on a variety of influences outside of the traditional world of technology, including religion, micro-banking for developing countries, and interactive art installations/workshops such as the Future Cube and a giant interactive video projection.\n\n\n\n"}

Dance has certainly been an important part of ceremony, rituals, celebrations and entertainment since before the birth of the earliest human civilizations. Archeology delivers traces of dance from prehistoric times such as the 5,000-year-old Bhimbetka rock shelters paintings in India and Egyptian tomb paintings depicting dancing figures from c. 3300 BC.\n\nOne of the earliest structured uses of dances may have been in the performance and in the telling of myths. It was also sometimes used to show feelings for one of the opposite gender. It is also linked to the origin of \"love making.\" Before the production of written languages, dance was one of the methods of passing these stories down from generation to generation.\n\nAnother early use of dance may have been as a precursor to ecstatic trance states in healing rituals. Dance is still used for this purpose by many cultures from the Brazilian rainforest to the Kalahari Desert.\n\nAn early manuscript describing dance is the Natya Shastra on which is based the \"modern\" interpretation of classical Indian dance (e.g. Bharathanatyam).\n\nIn a classical Greek song, Apollo, the god of medicine, music and poetry, one of the twelve greater gods and son of the chief god Zeus, was called The Dancer. In a Greek line Zeus himself is represented as dancing. Terpsichore is one of the nine Muses, representing dancing and dramatic chorus. In Sparta, a province of ancient Greece, the law compelled parents to exercise their children in dancing from the age of five years. They were led by grown men, and sang hymns and songs as they danced. \nIn very early times a Greek chorus, consisting of the whole population of the city, would meet in the market-place to offer up thanksgivings to the god of the country. Their jubilees were always attended with hymn-singing and dancing.\n\nThe Torah, the Psalms, and many other scriptures reference dance:\n\nOld Testament\n\nNew Testament\n\nFrom a Hindu point of view, the whole Universe is being brought into existence as the manifestation of the dance of the Supreme Dancer, Nataraja. In the Hindu scriptures, every god has his or her own style (lasya and tandava respectively represent two aspects of dance) we read about 23 celestial beings called Apsarases who dance to please the gods and express the supreme truths in the magic of movement.\n\nThe dance in the Hinduism used to be a part of a sacred temple ritual, especially in South and Eastern India, where the female priestesses devadasi's worshiped different aspects of the Divine through the elaborate language of mime and gestures. Natyashastra is the most ancient and the most elaborate scripture describing every element and aspect of this sacred art-worship.\n\nThe temple dance gradually evolved into what is known today as the South Indian Classical Dance that still preserves many ritualistic elements of Hinduism. Some of the classical Indian dancers are believed to be incarnations of apsaras.\n\nSee Seungmu\n\n\nIn the Protoevangelium of James, it is reported that Mary danced before the Ark of the Covenant in the Temple of Jerusalem at the time of her presentation.\n\nThroughout the history of Christianity, several denominations and independent congregations prohibited social dancing for various reasons; however, dance has always been a part of the social life of many Christians. Christian lyrics are found in the sounds of Ballroom, Country, Rock and Roll, Latin, Night Club, and other dance music. Ballet originated in Italy at weddings.\n\nNumerous examples of traditional dance can be found in modern Roman Catholic communities. The Brazilian dance and martial art of capoeira (particularly capoeira angola) is regularly performed—including between \"capoeiristas\" of different sexes—to lyrics and \"ladinhas\" (litanies) praising God, the saints, and the Virgin. In a similar vein, several genres of dance music in Romani people/Romani culture involve religious themes and lyrics. In the Philippines, the \"Subli\"—a devotional dance of the Catholic Tagalogs in Batangas Province—honours the True Cross. Finally, the celebrations of Carnival and Mardi Gras feature dance.\n\nMany Charismatic and Pentecostal Protestant denomonations practice dance during worship services. Congregants frequently dance during services as an act of worship. Some Charismatics practice prophetic dance, a religious practice in which practitioners believe they are representing what the Lord is doing through their movements. This is often accompanied with banners, ribbons and, instruments. Bethel Church in Redding, California has a school where people who wished to be trained in prophetic dance can go.\n\n\n"}

The dvarapala statue is a widespread architectural element throughout Hindu and Buddhist cultures, as well as in areas influenced by them like Java.\n\nIn most southeast Asian languages (including Thai, Burmese, Vietnamese, Khmer and Javanese), these protective figures are referred to as \"dvarapala\". Sanskrit \"dvāra\" means \"gate\" or \"door\", and \"pāla\" means \"guard\" or \"protector\".\n\nThe related name in Indonesian and Malaysia is \"dwarapala\". Equivalent door guardians in northern Asian languages are \"Kongōrikishi\" or \"Niō\" in Japanese, \"Heng Ha Er Jiang\" in Chinese, and \"Narayeongeumgang\" in Korean.\n\nDvarapalas as an architectural feature have their origin in tutelary deities, like Yaksha and warrior figures, such as Acala, of the local popular religion. Today some dvarapalas are even figures of policemen or soldiers standing guard.\n\nThese statues were traditionally placed outside Buddhist or Hindu temples, as well as other structures like royal palaces, to protect the holy places inside. A dvarapala is usually portrayed as an armed fearsome guardian looking like a demon, but at the gates of Buddhist temples in Sri Lanka, dvarapalas often display average human features. In other instances a fierce-looking nāga snake figure may perform the same function. \n\nThe sculptures in Java and Bali, usually carved from andesite, portray dvarapalas as fearsome giants with a rather bulky physique in semi kneeling position and holding a club. The largest dvarapala stone statue in Java, a dvarapala of the Singhasari period, is 3.7 meters tall. The traditional dvarapalas of Cambodia and Thailand, on the other hand, are leaner and portrayed in a standing position holding the club downward in the center.\n\nThe ancient sculpture of dvarapala in Thailand is made of a high-fired stoneware clay covered with a pale, almost milky celadon glaze. Ceramic sculptures of this type were produced in Thailand, during the Sukhothai and Ayutthaya periods, between the 14th and 16th centuries, at several kiln complexes located in northern Thailand. \n\nDepending on the size and wealth of the temple, the guardians could be placed singly, in pairs or in larger groups. Smaller structures may have had only one dvarapala. Often there was a pair placed on either side of the threshold to the shrine. Some larger sites may have had four (lokapālas, guardians of the four cardinal directions), eight, or 12. In some cases only the fierce face or head of the guardian is represented, a figure very common in the kratons in Java.\n\n\n"}

Located some southwest of Sjöbo in southern Sweden, it belongs to the Diocese of Lund. The church is noted for the many frescos which decorate the vaulted ceilings in the nave and the chancel.\n\nThe present church was built in the 12th century, replacing an earlier wooden church. It stands on a site that was used as an ancient place of worship. In the 13th century, a broad tower was built at the west end of the building.\n\nThe church originally had a flat wooden ceiling. In the 15th century, it replaced with vaults. As the nave was unusually wide, two columns were built in the centre of the nave to support them. As a result, six vaults, each with four segments, were built in the nave in addition to a vault with four segments in the chancel. The Baroque altarpiece and pulpit are from 1626.\n\nThe frescos were painted in about 1500 by the so-called Everlöv Workshop which bears strong similarities to the Brarup and Elmelunde Workshops in Denmark. The vaults in the chancel are decorated with paintings of the four Evangelists. Those in the nave include the Creation, Adam and Eve, Lazarus, the Nativity and the seven deadly sins.\n"}
{"id": "919807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=919807", "title": "Graphic arts", "text": "Graphic arts\n\nA category of fine art, graphic art covers a broad range of visual artistic expression, typically two-dimensional, i.e. produced on a flat surface. The term usually refers to the arts that rely more on line or tone than on colour, especially drawing and the various forms of engraving; it is sometimes understood to refer specifically to printmaking processes, such as line engraving, aquatint, drypoint, etching, mezzotint, monotype, lithography, and screen printing (silk-screen, serigraphy). Graphic art further includes calligraphy, photography, painting, typography, computer graphics, and bindery. It also encompasses drawn plans and layouts for interior and architectural designs.\n\nThroughout history, technological inventions have shaped the development of graphic art. In 2500 BC, the Egyptians used graphic symbols to communicate their thoughts in a written form known as hieroglyphics. The Egyptians wrote and illustrated narratives on rolls of papyrus to share the stories and art with others.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, scribes manually copied each individual page of manuscripts to maintain their sacred teachings. The scribes would leave marked sections of the page available for artists to insert drawings and decorations. Using art alongside the carefully lettered text enhanced the religious reading experience.\n\nJohannes Gutenberg invented an improved movable type mechanical device known as the printing press in 1450, the first outside of Asia. His printing press facilitated the mass-production of text and graphic art and eventually, replaced manual transcriptions altogether.\n\nAgain during the Renaissance years, graphic art in the form of printing played a major role in the spread of classical learning in Europe. Within these manuscripts, book designers focused heavily on typeface.\n\nDue to the development of larger fonts during the Industrial Revolution, posters became a popular form of graphic art used to communicate the latest information as well as to advertise the latest products and services.\n\nThe invention and popularity of film and television changed graphic art through the additional aspect of motion as advertising agencies attempted to use kinetics to their advantage.\n\nThe next major change in graphic arts came when the personal computer was invented in the twentieth century. Powerful computer software enables artists to manipulate images in a much faster and simpler way than the skills of board artists prior to the 1990s. With quick calculations, computers easily recolor, scale, rotate, and rearrange images if the programs are known.\n\nThe scientific investigations into legibility has influenced such things as the design of street signs. New York City is in the process of changing out all of its street signs bearing all capital letters for replacement with signs bearing only upper and lower case letters. They estimate that the increased legibility will facilitate way-finding and reduce crashes and injuries significantly.\n\nGraphic artists applying for positions in today's job market are expected to be familiar with computers and a variety of software programs in order to create the most appealing, up to date designs.\n\nGraphic art software includes applications such as:\n\n\nBeside computers and software, graphic artists are also expected to be creative with processing camera work, registration, crop marks, and masking.\n\nOne of the most common career paths for a graphic artist today is web design. With the popularity of the World Wide Web, the demand for web designers is immense. Graphic artists use their creativity with layouts, typography, and logos to market the products or services of the client’s business. In addition to creating graphical designs, graphic artists also need to understand hypertext, web programming, and web page maintenance in order to successfully create a web page. The responsibility for effective communication also falls under the auspices of the graphic designer.\n\n"}

With the establishment of the State of Israel, the name of the association was changed to the \"Association of Painters and Sculptors in Israel\". In 2002, the name was changed again to \"Painters and Sculptors Association (Tel Aviv)\" and three independent associations of painters and sculptors were established in Jerusalem, Haifa and Be'er Sheva.\n\nThe association was founded in October 1920 by the Association of Hebrew Artists, in its committee were the following artists: Meir Gur-Arie, S. Ben-David, Abel Pann, Avraham Melnikov and Shmuel Opel. The aim of the association was to \"develop and disseminate among the people the arts, the art work and taste and beauty in the Hebrew spirit.\" In April 1921 the members of the association presented an exhibition at the Tower of David.\n\nSince 1923, the association has exhibited 19 different group exhibitions. These were eclectic exhibitions with many works of art on various artistic levels. Alongside these exhibitions, occasional group exhibitions were held on a commercial or artistic basis.\n\nIn addition, the Society created the Painting and Sculpture Section of the journal \"Theater and Art\" which was published in 1927.\n\nOn August 4, 1934, the first convention of the Association of Painters and Sculptors was held in Tel Aviv. There was talk about building a pavilion for exhibitions and a permanent exhibition, establishing a cooperative of painters, a club, mutual help and housing for the members of the association. A committee was chosen, composed of Chaim Gliksberg, Nahum Gutman, Newman, Avni, Yishai Kolbiansky, Leoben and Eliahu Sigard. Gliksberg was the association secretary. On August 14, a parallel assembly was held in Jerusalem, in which a committee was appointed that included Zeev Ben Zvi, Meir Gur-Arie and Jacob Steinhardt.\n\nOne of the association's exhibitions, \"The Eighth Exhibition,\" took place in December 1942 at Habima Theatre, where the works of Arie Aroch, Aharon Giladi, Zvi Meirovitch, Avraham Natan (Nathanson), Avigdor Stematsky and Yehezkel Streichman were exhibited. Another sculptor, Dov Feigin appeared in the catalog but did not participate in the exhibition at last. Another exhibition – \"The Shiva Exhibition\" – took place in 1947 at the Tel Aviv Museum, with the participation of Aroch, Giladi, Meirovitch, Natan, Streichman, Jacob Wexler and Yosef Zaritsky. In these exhibitions, the artists aspired to the creation of modern art under European influence and to create \"an original style, rooted in our reality.\" In these exhibitions, although they did not establish a clear artistic platform, there was a tendency to emphasize the painterly means. In addition, these exhibitions symbolized a certain separation and a \"positive appearance\" of the artists against the background of the \"generalism\" regime ... which helps blur the boundaries and dimensions, in order to impose mediocrity \"\n\nIn 1948,Yosef Zaritsky served as chairman of the association, and when an invitation came to present an exhibition of Israeli artists in the Italian pavilion at the Venice Biennale, he chose not to share the list of participating artists because of his concern about the selection of medium-sized artists. In the wake of the accusations, several artists, including Moshe Castel, Streichman and Yohanan Simon, announced their immediate retirement from the association, and they established with Zaritsky the \"Ofakim Hadashim\".\n\nFrom 1964 to 1967, Ruth Horam served as the chairperson of the Association\n\nFrom 1969 to 1981, Alexander Bogen served as chairman of the Association.\n\nIn the years 1989–2005, Rachel Shavit-Bentwich served as chairperson of the Association and as Chairperson of the Honorary Council.\n\n\nVisual arts in Israel\n\n"}

The mosque is the result of continual construction, reconstruction, additions and renovations on the site from around 771 to the end of the 20th century. The Grand Bazaar of Isfahan can be found towards the southwest wing of the mosque. It has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2012.\n\nBuilt during the Umayyad dynasty, it is rumored in Isfahan that one of the pillars of this Mosque were personally built by the Caliph in Damascus. Prior to it becoming a Mosque, it is said to have been a house of worship for Zoroastrians.\n\nThis is one of the oldest mosques still standing in Iran, and it was built in the four-\"iwan\" architectural style, placing four gates face to face. An \"iwan\" is a vaulted open room. The \"qibla iwan\" on the southern side of the mosque was vaulted with \"muqarnas\" during the 13th century. \"Muqarnas\" are niche-like cells.\n\nConstruction under the Seljuqs included the addition of two brick domed chambers, for which the mosque is renowned. The south dome was built to house the mihrab in 1086–87 by Nizam al-Mulk, the famous vizier of Malik Shah, and was larger than any dome known at its time. The north dome was constructed a year later by Nizam al-Mulk's rival Taj al-Mulk. The function of this domed chamber is uncertain. Although it was situated along the north-south axis, it was located outside the boundaries of the mosque. The dome was certainly built as a direct riposte to the earlier south dome, and successfully so, claiming its place as a masterpiece in Persian architecture for its structural clarity and geometric balance. Iwans were also added in stages under the Seljuqs, giving the mosque its current four-iwan form, a type which subsequently became prevalent in Iran and the rest of the Islamic world.\n\nResponding to functional needs of the space, political ambition, religious developments, and changes in taste, further additions and modifications took place incorporating elements from the Mongols, Muzzafarids, Timurids and Safavids. Of note is the elaborately carved stucco mihrab commissioned in 1310 by Mongol ruler Oljaytu, located in a side prayer hall built within the western arcade. Safavid intervention was largely decorative, with the addition of muqarnas, glazed tilework, and minarets flanking the south iwan.\n\nThe cupolas and piers that form the hypostyle area between the iwans are undated and varied in style, endlessly modified with repairs, reconstructions and additions.\n\nThe origins of this mosque lie in the 8th century, but it burnt down and was rebuilt again in the 11th century during the Seljuk dynasty and went through remodeling many times. As a result, it has rooms built in different architectural styles, so now the mosque represents a condensed history of Iranian Architecture.\n\n\n"}

Linda became landlady of The Queen Victoria public house and moved there with her family from her mother's pub in Watford. In May 2016, Bright announced that she was pregnant with her second child and that she would be taking maternity leave. Linda departed the series on 25 December 2016 although she made two separate guest appearances on 16 March 2017 and 30 June 2017. She returned full-time on 7 August 2017.\n\nThe introduction of Dyer and Bright was part of a large cast shake-up planned by new executive producer Treadwell-Collins in an attempt to improve ratings. Bright previously auditioned for the role of Tanya Branning in 2006, but the part was given to Jo Joyner.\n\nLinda's storylines include her feud with Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), coming to terms with her youngest son Johnny (Sam Strike/Ted Reilly) being gay, being raped by Mick's brother Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo) and coping in the aftermath, giving birth to a premature baby after falling down the stairs, suffering from bulimia nervosa, being in denial of the possibility that her baby son Ollie Carter could have brain damage, leaving to care for her mother Elaine Peacock (Maria Friedman) following her stroke, discovering that Mick kissed their daughter-in-law Whitney Carter (Shona McGarty) and revealing that she has secretly battled cervical cancer before being involved in an ambulance crash when Johnny is shot and perverting the course of justice when Stuart Highway (Ricky Champ) is shot leading to her being falsely accused of attempted murder.\n\nLinda first appears when her partner Mick's sister, Shirley and Tina, visit her mother Elaine Peacock's (Maria Friedman) pub in Watford, where Linda and her family are living. They intend to ask Mick for a loan but Linda rejects them as Mick is not around. As revenge, Tina steals the money from a bingo jar but Shirley returns it, proving her honesty to Mick, and also recommends The Queen Victoria (The Vic) as a potential pub of their own on Albert Square in Walford, where Shirley lives. Mick purchases the pub from Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), who is at first unaware of his identity, and Mick, Linda, their son Johnny Carter (Sam Strike) and their dog, Lady Di (Hot Lips), move in and start trading. Linda continues to clash with Shirley, who moves in with them, and she befriends Sharon Rickman (Letitia Dean) over their mutual dislike of Shirley. Linda and Mick receive an invite to their daughter Nancy Carter's (Maddy Hill) wedding to Wayne Ladlow (Malachi Kirby), a troublemaker, but they disapprove so Mick forcibly removes her from the wedding service. In the following argument, Nancy reveals that Johnny is gay, and has been hiding his sexuality in fear of how his parents will react. Linda refuses to accept that he is gay and encourages him to date Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), who shows an interest in him. Mick, along with Shirley and Tina, visit their estranged father Stan Carter (Timothy West) for money, and reunite with him in the process. He moves into the pub when he breaks his ankle and becomes immobile, and, despite initially clashing with him, Linda warms to having him around.\n\nLinda's friendship with Sharon comes under strain when Sharon reveals plans to open a new bar in Walford, named \"The Albert\". Realising it will be in direct competition to The Vic, she plots to get inside knowledge about the bar, convincing Johnny to take a job there.

He is grieving for a comrade he has lost, and Linda is a comfort and support to him. Shirley's estranged son Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo) comes to Walford, and although he continues to share a troubled relationship with his mother, he is welcomed by Mick and Linda into the family. Dean develops feelings for Linda, which she is at first unaware of, but discovers when he gropes her buttocks at a photoshoot for his new salon. She warns him that it is inappropriate but does not tell Mick out of fear of angering him.\n\nTina encourages Johnny to embrace his sexuality, inviting him to gay pride in London. Linda continues to be uncomfortable with this, and attempts to sabotage his plans by making him work. However, he realises what she is doing and in the ensuing argument he leaves home. Stan takes Linda to his old flat where Johnny is staying, and, after some tough love from Stan about her past, she apologises to Johnny and drops him off at gay pride, giving him her blessing. The following week, Linda has a party for her birthday, and Lee returns permanently from Afghanistan in time for the celebrations. After the party, Linda and Mick have a heart to heart, and he asks her to marry him properly, but she declines, determined to keep up the pretence to their children that they are already married. This conversation is overheard by Dean, who agrees to keep quiet.\n\nLinda supports Mick when he participates in a swimming gala for Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick), despite being fearful of water. Mick conquers his fears, but on the way home he is arrested for soliciting a prostitute. He tells Linda that the police are making a mistake as it was in fact his friend Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), that was speaking with the prostitute; he pulled over merely to see what was going on. Stan's girlfriend, Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell) overhears the conversation and accompanies Linda to Mick's hearing, and Linda is devastated when he pleads guilty to protect Ian, who is going through a tough time following the death of his daughter, Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater). Linda agrees to keep quiet, but Cora has a change of heart about supporting Linda and reveals Mick's offence to the whole pub, running his name through the mud. Unable to cope with the negative social stigma surrounding her family, Linda demands that Mick reveals the truth, but he refuses, wanting to keep his word to Ian. However, the truth is revealed when the prostitute, who is revealed to be Cora's estranged daughter Rainie Cross (Tanya Franks), bumps into Ian's partner Denise Fox (Diane Parish) and reveals the truth. Denise visits Linda, struggling with the revelation, and Linda lies that she only just found out about Ian's actions. Ian however reveals the truth to Denise, who accuses Linda of attention seeking. One evening, Dean kisses Linda but she slaps him. Distraught over the upset that Mick's actions have brought her family, Linda leaves Walford to stay with Elaine in Watford. She returns, reconciling with Mick, before Sharon and Phil's wedding. When Sharon suggests that Dean's advances towards Linda were encouraged, both drunk, they have a bitter row in the pub. Then Sharon tells Nancy about the kiss, so Nancy accuses Dean and Linda of having an affair.\n\nShirley flees from Walford after the wedding, leaving Dean upset. Mick asks Linda to comfort him, but, misunderstanding her reassurance and very drunk, Dean rapes her. She becomes very withdrawn, telling nobody and refusing to be intimate with Mick. Trying to get to the bottom of what is going on, he calls Linda's mother, Elaine, asking her to visit The Vic to help him understand her behaviour. Elaine makes some progress before leaving again. Mick theorises that Linda is pregnant when she vomits at the smell of lavender bath soap, and she, is horrified to discover he is correct, when she takes a test. She lies to Mick about the result and plans to have an abortion, but Mick finds out and she agrees to keep the baby. She is disturbed when Dean finds out, and tries to hang onto the belief that the baby is Mick's. Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner) bumps into Linda who asks her about her relationship with Dean, Linda nearly admits that Dean raped her however she is stopped from doing so when they are interrupted by Dean. However, Stacey grows suspicious, and when Linda unexpectedly gets scared when Dean is around, Stacey surmises that Dean raped her and confronts Linda. When Stacey depicts how she felt after her rape, Linda accepts that he did. Johnny announces he is leaving Walford to travel with Gianluca, although initially upset, Linda decides to support him.\n\nLinda, feeling increasingly threatened by Dean, turns down Mick's Christmas Day proposal before stunning Mick by revealing the rape. Later that day he confronts Dean who lies, saying that he and Linda were having an affair. Mick attacks Dean forcing Shirley's revelation—Dean is his brother. Linda eavesdrops while Mick, Tina, Shirley, Babe and Stan argue, only to hear Mick deny that Dean is part of the family. Mick tells them that Dean raped Linda, but she overhears. Without saying anything, Linda leaves the pub. Mick leaves messages on her voicemail to ask her to come home and Elaine returns her to the pub. When she attempts to find solace in Sharon's home, Mick joins her, and she says they should not let what happened get in the way of their relationship. They are about to return to the pub when Mick has second thoughts and he decides to take Linda away for a break. When they return a few weeks later, they find Shirley helping to run the pub so Mick asks her to leave. When Mick accompanies her to the police station, Linda reports Dean for rape. She then fills Nancy and Lee in on recent events, having already told Elaine and Sharon. Dean is arrested by the police but released after questioning and accuses Linda of lying. Linda proposes to Mick who accepts. The next day, Nancy confesses to her that Mick choked Dean unconscious in the cellar and is being secretive about what happened. Elaine returns for Mick and Linda's engagement party, while Linda confronts Mick, who assures her that he did not kill Dean, although, later, Nancy tries to tell Shirley something about Dean, but collapses on the ground before she can do so. After Elaine returns for Linda's five-month scan the day after, Linda confesses to her her fears that the baby may not be Mick's. Linda organises a romantic picnic as a fresh start for her and Mick. Linda is devastated to learn that Dean will not be charged due to lack of evidence. Linda pleads with Dean to admit he raped her but just as she seems to be making leeway, Mick interrupts.\n\nLinda falls down the stairs, causing her to go into premature labour. She gives birth to a healthy son, Ollie Carter (Jack Tilley). Linda confronts a delusional Dean when he insists on meeting the baby, believing that Ollie is his son. Mick discovers that he, Linda and Ollie share the same blood type, but Dean does not, meaning Dean cannot be the father. Linda and Mick agree they should marry soon. On her return home with Mick and Ollie, Linda snubs an apologetic Dean's attempt to shake her hand. When Linda and Nancy return from holiday, Linda learns that Lee has been suffering from depression, and she encourages him to take his medication. Elaine moves in temporarily, which initially causes consternation when she interferes with running the pub. Mick arranges for Linda to go to a wedding fair in Birmingham, and when she returns, she discovers that Mick and Shirley have been seeing each other in secret, which upsets Linda. After making herself sick one day, she tells Mick she cannot get married. Eventually, she tells him she hates herself and, because of Dean, she feels the same way she did when she suffered from bulimia after her father died, and has been making herself sick again. However, she agrees to marry Mick with his support. When Dean attempts to rape his fiancée Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), Linda encourages her to report this to the police. During a heated exchange with Linda where Shirley is present, Dean admits that he raped Linda. Stunned, Linda tells Mick, while Dean goes into hiding, where he sees one of Mick and Linda's wedding invites. Dean goes to the wedding venue and attempts to drown Shirley, jumping into the lake with her. Mick fights with Dean in the lake and he is knocked unconscious. Mick rescues him and resuscitates him, and he is arrested for the attempted rape of Roxy. Afterwards, Linda and Mick marry. When they return from their honeymoon, Whitney kisses Mick, saying she has feelings for him, so he tells Linda what happened. Linda tells Whitney to keep away from Mick and not to give up on Lee.\n\nNancy and Lee have an argument, which causes Ollie (now Charlie Harrington) to fall off his highchair. Mick and Linda do not witness this, and when Mick insists they should get Ollie to hospital, Linda states he seems fine, but she later finds Ollie is not breathing. She successfully resuscitates him, only for him to suffer a seizure. Ollie is taken to hospital where a doctor tells the Carters that he could have brain damage after a head injury. Linda, in denial about the severity of Ollie's condition, argues with Mick, especially when he blames Nancy for the incident, however, she soon realises that Mick is right about Ollie having changed when he does not respond to her in the usual way. Linda is delighted by Johnny's (now Ted Reilly) return but saddened by Nancy's departure. Linda is devastated when Dean is acquitted but tells Mick she has become a strong person and that their relationship has become stronger. The Carters are later devastated when a pregnant Whitney suffers a miscarriage but are delighted when Lee and Whitney get married. The Carters are traumatised by a violent robbery on The Vic, during which Linda's favourite necklace is stolen. Linda is inspired to make Christmas great as a result, and is overjoyed when Ollie takes his first steps. Linda is devastated to learn that Elaine has had a stroke in Spain on Christmas Eve, and she flies out there with Johnny to support her mother. Later, Johnny returns to Walford while Linda relocates with Elaine to Watford to aid her mother's recovery. Mick visits Linda and informs her that Babe has caused the pub to be fined £20,000 because of her selling alcohol illegally outside of licensing hours. When Mick struggles to cope with the pub's mounting debts, Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) calls Linda, worried about Mick. Linda returns the following day and Mick informs her of Lee's departure and the debts he left. Linda initially blames Whitney and an argument ensues, causing Whitney to leave. Mick explains to Linda that it was Lee's fault, causing another argument, although they make up and have sex. After a heart-to-heart with Whitney, Linda decides to return to Elaine, which angers Mick as Linda saw the state he was in and left anyway. Linda then sends Woody Woodward (Lee Ryan) to work in The Vic as a bar manager. With Lady Di needing an expensive operation and mounting debts, Shirley convinces Linda to sell the freehold of The Vic, and they agree not to tell Mick. Linda signs the paperwork and Shirley forges Mick's signature. Linda returns to Walford for her birthday and meets Fi Browning (Lisa Faulkner), The Vic's business consultant sent by the freeholder, Grafton Hill, and with the changes, she feels that The Vic is not her home. She leaves again in the middle of the night, saying Elaine has fallen, but she is fine and Linda tells Elaine that she could not talk to Mick.\n\nTwo months later, Mick phones Linda, telling her to come back home or else there will be nothing to come back to. When Linda and Ollie (now Harry Farr) return, she is surprised when she discovers the amount of changes that have happened. When Linda discovers that Mick has been fighting in the pub, Shirley tells her that he has struggled with her prolonged absence and Linda admits that she has neglected him. When Linda is seemingly about to tell Mick about her secret, Mick admits to her that he is in love with someone else. Linda realises it is Whitney and throws her out, while Mick begs her not to give up on their marriage. Linda agrees to reconcile but is furious when Mick admits he paid Whitney off, so she slaps him. Following a conversation with Fi, Linda offers Whitney her job back but she also defies Fi by rehiring Tracey (Jane Slaughter). After confiding in Denise about Mick's infatuation, Denise tells Linda that she saw Mick and Whitney kiss several months previously. Linda then learns that Fi nearly kissed Mick. Linda considers leaving Walford with Ollie, however, she talks to Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) and reveals that Elaine's stroke was not severe and she recovered relatively quickly, but that Linda stayed away from Walford because she had been diagnosed with cervical cancer while caring for Elaine. Jack accompanies Linda to a check-up where she is told that there are no signs of cancer in her body but there is a chance it could come back, so she is unsure if she should tell Mick, but she does so. They go on holiday to rekindle their marriage and when they return, Linda is delighted that Whitney and Woody are emigrating, but Woody leaves without Whitney, so Linda is annoyed. Mick asks Linda to renew their wedding vows and she accepts, though has doubts after seeing Mick comforting Whitney. The Carters attempt to raise money after Grafton Hill tell them they need to pay £60,000 in repair costs or face eviction, though Fi tells them she has reduced it to £50,000. They raise the money but Fi's father, James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde), reveals he now owns the business and Fi denies reducing the debt. James gives an eviction notice to the Carters, giving them a month to leave. After James collapses due to a heart attack, Fi gives the Carters a chance to buy back the freehold for the Vic for £150,000. Linda rejects this offer, calling it unrealistic and telling her that her family will get their comeuppance. However, Mick is determined to find the money to keep the pub and signs up to participate in a robbery with Aidan Maguire (Patrick Bergin) and his gang on New Year's Day Linda is distraught when Mick is shot by Halfway (Tony Clay), an army friend of Lee's during the robbery. However, Mick recovers with the help of Linda, Mariam Ahmed and a remorseful Halfway, who offers to help out at the pub. Several days later, Mick finds an expensive ring in Halfway's possession and interrogates Halfway, who admits he stole it from the robbery. Halfway gives the ring to the Carters, who then give the ring to Fi in exchange for the freehold for the pub. However, Aidan becomes suspicious of this and attempts to blackmail Mick into letting him use the pub for drug dealing. Aidan steps up his demands, repeatedly forcing him to accept money for these drug deals despite Linda returning it. The Carters decide to flee Walford to escape Aidan, who shows up and beats Mick up for not giving into his demands. However, Phil stops Aidan at the last minute and pressures him into leaving Walford or he'll reveal to the police that he killed Fi's brother Luke Browning (Adam Astill). Aidan calls off the drug deals, giving the Carters back control of the Vic.\n\nHalfway's brother and Mick's longtime friend, Stuart Highway (Ricky Champ), arrives. Tina reveals that he abused her and another person Dylan Box (Ricci Harnett) when they were teenagers, and she attacks him. Stuart seeks revenge on the Carters and one night, Stuart is shot in the Vic. Linda initially thinks Mick shot Stuart so she dumps the gun in the canal after she finds it in the bar but she is seen by Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters). Mick tells Linda he is innocent and she worries whether she did the right thing, though Mick reassures her. The next day, Linda is arrested for Stuart's attempted murder. However, when Stuart regains consciousness, he tells the police that Mick shot him, and Mick is arrested and remanded. Linda ends their relationship when he admits he started smothering Stuart and tells Stuart she believes that Mick shot him. Linda and Stuart begin meeting regularly and become close despite the family's protests. She tells the family she thinks Mick is guilty, throws away her wedding rings, and later throws the family out, then allows Stuart to move in, and calls a solicitor to begin divorce proceedings from Mick. When Shirley breaks into the pub to confront Linda over being manipulated by Stuart, Linda calls the police and they arrest Shirley. She is released the next day and attacks Stuart. Linda takes Shirley aside and secretly shows her that she has hidden her wedding rings in her bra: her close friendship with Stuart is actually part of a bigger plan to help get Mick out of prison as she still loves Mick and believes he is innocent.\n\nLinda was introduced as the wife of Mick Carter, played by Danny Dyer, the brother of established character Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), who has appeared in \"EastEnders\" since 2006. Luisa Bradshaw-White joined the cast as Shirley's sister Tina Carter in early November, and Linda was the second new Carter to appear after her. Kellie Bright's casting was announced alongside Danny Dyer's on 1 October 2013, a week after Bradshaw-White's casting was revealed. Linda was described as having been with Mick since they were teenagers, and despite not being 'blessed with brains', is a 'tough woman who will always fight tooth and nail for her family - especially her children'. Bright previously appeared as a bridesmaid in 1986 at the wedding of Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) and Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt), and starred in scenes opposite her current co-star Letitia Dean, who continues to appear as Sharon Watts. Bright estimated herself to be aged 10 at the time. She also auditioned for the role of Tanya Branning in 2006, a role that was eventually given to Jo Joyner.\n\nLinda first appeared in an episode that aired on BBC One on 19 December 2013, visited by her partner Mick's sisters Shirley and Tina when they needed money. Linda rejected them. She made her full arrival on 26 December 2013, the Boxing Day episode for \"EastEnders\", moving into her new home on Albert Square, The Queen Victoria. Mick and Linda became the landlord and landlady of their pub, positions they still hold as of today. In a poll held by Digital Spy a month after the introduction of the Carters, Linda was the least popular, with 5.65% of the vote. Mick proved to be the most popular, with nearly 50% of the vote.\n\nLinda's early stories included her struggle with son Johnny's (Sam Strike) sexuality, which was revealed a week after the Carters moved into the Vic. While Mick portrayed the accepting father (a portrayal that was widely praised by critics), Linda protested against her son being gay, and encouraged him to enter a relationship with his friend, Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), who was obviously keen. This caused many arguments between mother and son. The argument eventually reached breaking point in June 2014, when Linda failed to support Johnny's plans to go to gay pride and caused him embarrassment by revealing his cowardice during the attack on Sharon Rickman (Letitia Dean). As a result, Johnny left home, but Linda tracked him down with the help of her father-in-law Stan (Timothy West), and they reunited, with Linda showing her acceptance by dropping him off at gay pride in London.\n\nOther storylines included Linda's turmoilous friendship with Sharon Rickman, which turned into a rivalry when she opened a rival bar, 'The Albert' in Walford; her plans to breed her dog, Lady Di, being scuppered when her daughter Nancy (Maddy Hill) lost control of her and she was impregnated by Abi Branning's (Lorna Fitzgerald) dog Tramp; and her turmoil over her eldest son, Lee (Danny-Boy Hanchard) being in the army, and her supporting him through the grief for a lost comrade on his return to England. She was involved in a brief scandal where Dexter Hartman (Khali Best), Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) and Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) discovered pictures of her during her time as a Page 3 model.\n\nUpon the character's announcement, Treadwell-Collins explained that in their fictional backstory, Mick and Linda have been married for over twenty years, and have been together since they were teenagers. \"Hello\" called them \"childhood sweethearts\". They were called \"a tight family unit\", and Treadwell-Collins said they have a \"good marriage\" and \"an easy shorthand with each other—but can also still fight like teenagers.\" He said that the characters would laugh, cry, argue and make up, which would embarrass their children, but would delight their neighbours. It was said that the couple \"still love each other, no matter what life throws at them\", and that after moving to the fictional setting of Walford from Watford, \"life's about to throw them a few curve balls.\" \"Inside Soap\" said that Mick and Linda have a passionate relationship and adore each other.<ref name=\"Inside Soap 2013 51/52\"></ref> Bright explained that Mick and Linda have grown up together, and said: \"It's a weird thing when you've known someone your whole life—you're more than just husband and wife. You're something else.\" She later said that Mick and Linda have known each other since they were five or six years old, and can finish each other's sentences and know how the other is feeling by the look on their face. Dyer and Bright both said that Mick and Linda are passionate and lustful, with Bright saying they are \"madly in love\" and describing a \"real fizz between them\". She said, \"they're kind of tearing each other's heads off or tearing each other's clothes off.\" Dyer said there is a \"Den and Angie [Watts] feel\" to the relationship. Jane Simon from the \"Daily Mirror\" said that the fact Mick and Linda are happily married is a \"rare thing in soapland\". However, in July 2014, it was revealed in storylines that Mick and Linda are not married, yet all their families believes they are, a fact that left Carena Crawford from \"All About Soap\" wondering why they never got married and why they kept this a secret, but she hoped for a big wedding.\n\nIn April 2014, Matt Di Angelo was reintroduced as Shirley Carter's estranged son Dean Wicks. Linda formed a connection with Dean as she counselled him through his long standing issues with his mother, having a fair perspective on the situation due to her own battles with Shirley in the past. Through this, Dean developed feelings for her. Linda remained unaware of the crush for several weeks until Dean fondled her buttocks during a photoshoot for the salon. Linda warned him to back off. Speaking of Dean's feelings for Linda, Di Angelo claimed that it stemmed from the desire that 'Dean (secretly) wants to be Mick', but warned that it wouldn't 'be filled with too much happiness for too long'. Dean also stumbled upon the family secret that Mick and Linda were not married, and later drunkenly kissed Linda when she was struggling with issues surrounding Mick falsely pleading guilty to soliciting prostitutes.\n\nOn 31 August 2014, it was announced that Dean would rape Linda. \"EastEnders\" bosses worked with charity Rape Crisis to develop the storyline. Bright said about the storyline that she 'hoped that Linda's journey would change viewers' perception of rape', while Di Angelo claimed that although the storyline will be 'challenging', it was massively 'important'. The storyline aired over the autumn. Maria Friedman was introduced as Linda's mother, Elaine Peacock. Following the attack Linda became pregnant. When Dean returns to the pub after a short absence, Bright stated that Linda is horrified despite trying to move on. Bright also added that Linda does not want to know who the baby's father is as she thinks that Linda is \"scared and terrified\".\n\nIn May 2016, Bright announced that she is pregnant with her second child, and on 28 September 2016 it was confirmed that Bright would take six months maternity leave. Linda's on screen departure aired on 25 December 2016. Bright interrupted her maternity leave for two episodes in March 2017, a voiceover on 14 March 2017 and on 23 May 2017 and a physical appearance on 16 March 2017.\n\nBright returned to filming full-time on 22 April 2017, and after making a guest appearance on 30 June 2017, her full-time return aired on 7 August.\n\nLinda appears in animated form in a \"Children in Need\" sketch called \"Tom and Jerry: A Fundraising Adventure\", broadcast during the 2014 telethon on 14 November 2014, along with Mick in The Queen Victoria. In the sketch, cartoon cat and mouse duo Tom and Jerry visit several animated versions of BBC stars, tasked by Terry Wogan to raise cash. Linda is not voiced in the sketch.\n\nAlong with Dyer, Bright was nominated for \"Best On-screen Partnership\" at The British Soap Awards 2014 for the relationship between Mick and Linda. However, they lost out to David Neilson and Julie Hesmondhalgh, who play Roy and Hayley Cropper respectively in \"Coronation Street\". Kate White from \"Inside Soap\" was pleased to see Linda's backstory explored, saying \"Now we know a bit about Linda's past and what made her a control freak, she's finally a sympathetic character. We liked her already, but we love her now!\" Bright won the awards for \"Best Actress\" and \"Best Dramatic Performance\" at The British Soap Awards 2015. In August 2017, Bright and Dyer were longlisted for Best Partnership and the showdown between Mick and Linda was longlisted for Best Show-Stopper. Neither nominations made the viewer-voted shortlist.\n\n"}

Sonia Manzano, best known for playing Maria Rodriguez on \"Sesame Street\", was a frequent writer for the show.\n\nSet in Philadelphia, the show centers on Little Bill Glover as he explores everyday life through his imagination. Little Bill lives with his parents, his great grandmother Alice (aka Alice the Great), his older sister April and brother Bobby.

It is believed to have originated during the mid-fifteenth century by Nikolaos Tzafouris.\n\nThe iconography of the Madre della Consolazione type is of Western origin. It has clearly been influenced by Italian prototypes from the 14th century. The icon’s Italian title refers to the suffering of Christ, as anticipated by his mother. The type was probably introduced to the Orthodox-Christian world by the famous icon painter Nikolaos Tzafouris in the second half of the 15th century; his oeuvre is typified by combined Byzantine and Italian iconographical types. Our icon is painted in a highly refined style and can be dated in the late 15th century.\n\nVery similar floral punched motifs can be found in the halos of the signed Tzafouris Pieta icon in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna and in the halos of the signed Tzafouris Madre della Consolazione icon in a Dutch private collection (currently on loan to the Ikonen-Museum Recklinghausen, Germany). The punching, the specific iconography and the refined style of the painting, all point towards Nikolaos Tzafouris or a painter from his immediate circle.\n\nThe icon was in the collection of Morsink Icon Gallery, Amsterdam till 2016 and then was purchased by a private collector from the Netherlands.\n"}

He graduated with a B.A. from Bucknell University, then studied in a traditional Japanese painting doctorate program for several years at Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music with several notable artists such as Takashi Murakami and Hiroshi Senju. He was the first non-native to participate in the Japanese Painting Doctorate Program, which dates back to 15th century. His bicultural arts education led his style towards a fusion between fine art and abstract expressionism, together with the traditional Japanese art of Nihonga and Kacho-ga (bird-and-flower painting tradition).\n\nOn September 1, 2015, Fujimura was appointed Director of the Brehm Center for Worship, Theology, and the Arts at Fuller Theological Seminary. In this role, he will be a “vision director” for Fuller’s Brehm Center, leading and teaching from his studio space in order to foster a robust, imaginative experience for students. Fujimura hopes to be a catalyst for innovation in the future of seminary education, integrating the best of the arts into the church, seeing cities as classrooms for that integration, and helping the church to become the leading practitioner of culture care. Fujimura understands \"culture care\" as giving import to the creation and conservation of beauty as an antidote to cultural brokenness by asserting a need for cultural “generativity” in public life. (See his speech on culture care at the National Press Club.) Fujimura’s book \"\" is a support volume to the personal gatherings and international speaking engagements in which he shares that vision with like-minded artists, supporters, and creatives.\nFujimura founded the International Arts Movement in 1991. He has co-hosted several major conferences for the International Arts Movement, and continues to develop the gathering through Culture Care Summit (Feb 8-12th, 2017 at Fuller). In 2011 the Fujimura Institute was established and launched the Qu4rtets, a collaboration between Fujimura, painter Bruce Herman, Duke theologian/pianist Jeremy Begbie, and Yale composer Christopher Theofanidis, based on T.S. Eliot’s Four Quartets. The exhibition travelled to Baylor University, Duke University, and Yale University, Hong Kong University, Cambridge University, Gordon College, Roanoke College and other institutions around the globe. Qu4rtets became the first contemporary art exhibited at the historic King's Chapel in Cambridge, UK, for the Easter of 2015, and was exhibited in Hiroshima for the 70th anniversary of the atomic bombings in November 2015.\n\nHe is represented by Artrue International and exhibits regularly in Waterfall Mansion Gallery in New York City and other galleries internationally.

At the completion of his term in 2009, then Chair Dana Gioia awarded him the Chairman's Medal for his service and contribution to arts advocacy in the United States.\n\nHis work includes “The Splendor of the Medium”, \"Water Flames,\" and \"Charis,\" and \"Golden Sea,\" a collection of paintings using stone-ground minerals including gold, platinum, azurite, malachite and cinnabar. He has collaborated with percussionist/composer Susie Ibarra on multiple occasions, and his live painting was recorded by Plywood Pictures in \"Live in New York: Susie Ibarra + Makoto Fujimura.\" (2009)\n\nIn November 2009, Fujimura's works were coupled with works of Georges Rouault at Dillon Gallery. Fujimura created several new works in homage to the 20th century master, the catalyst of the \"Sacred Arts Movement\" in Paris that influenced Picasso, Matisse and other modernist artists. Fujimura wrote an essay for the show that was included in a short book that was produced to accompany the show called \"Soliloquies\" (Square Halo Books, 2009).\n\nCrossway Publishing commissioned Fujimura in 2009 for The Four Holy Gospels project to commemorate the 400th Anniversary of the publishing of the King James Bible. It was the first time that a single artist has been commissioned to illuminate the four Gospels in nearly five hundred years. The Gospels were on exhibition at the Museum Of Biblical Art in Manhattan in 2011, and are on display in Takashimaya, Nihonbashi, Tokyo, until December, 2011. The Four Holy Gospels consist of five major frontispieces, 89 chapter heading letters and over 140 pages of hand illumined pages, all done in traditional Nihonga.

The agency handles literary estates and subsidiary rights for the authors that it represents.\n\nMavis McIntosh (1906-1986) and Elizabeth Otis founded McIntosh & Otis in the mid 1920s, after they quit the literary agency at which they were working because they were dissatisfied with its practices. In 1928, they incorporated the firm, and by the early 1930s, it was a reputable and successful literary agency.\n\nIn 1963, McIntosh & Otis merged with New-York based agency Constance Smith Associates. Patricia Schartle Myrer, who was a partner at Constance Smith Associates, became President of McIntosh & Otis.\n\nIn the 1970s, McIntosh & Otis hired Eugene Winick, a copyright attorney, as outside counsel to represent the literary estates of authors represented by McIntosh & Otis, such as Mary Higgins Clark, Harper Lee, Sinclair Lewis, Ayn Rand, and Thomas Wolfe. In 1984, Patricia Schartle Myrer retired and appointed Eugene Winick as President of McIntosh & Otis.\n\nIn 2001, Samuel Pinkus, a literary agent at McIntosh & Otis and Eugene Winick's son-in-law, took over as President of the agency but left in 2004.\nElizabeth Winick Rubinstein, Eugene Winick's daughter, is currently the President of McIntosh & Otis.\n\nIn 1931, John Steinbeck sent McIntosh & Otis a number of his early manuscripts based on the recommendation of Carl Wilhelmson. McIntosh & Otis gave Steinbeck positive encouragement, and he stuck with the firm as his only literary agency for the rest of his career, spanning nearly 40 years.\n\nIn 1952, McIntosh & Otis sold the film rights of Steinbeck's classic novel \"East of Eden\" (1952) to Warner Brothers, which adapted it as a 1955 movie starring James Dean. Steinbeck received $125,000 for the film rights, plus 25 percent of the profits.\n\nWhen Steinbeck won the 1962 Nobel Prize for literature, he gave McIntosh & Otis a percentage of the award money out of gratitude for their support.\n\nIn 2004, McIntosh & Otis sold the film rights of Steinbeck's classic novel \"East of Eden\" to Universal Pictures, after the book was chosen for Oprah's Book Club list. The option expired, and Universal had to once again obtain the film rights. A forthcoming two-film series, starring Jennifer Lawrence, was scheduled for production as of April 2014.\n\nPatricia Highsmith appointed Patricia Schartle Myrer as her literary agent in 1959, when Myrer was with Constance Smith Associates. After Constance Smith Associates merged with McIntosh & Otis in 1963, Myrer continued as Patricia Highsmith's American literary agent. A. M. Heath served as Patricia Highsmith's British agents. Over time, Patricia Highsmith came to resent the 5% commission each literary agency took, and Myrer fired Highsmith in 1979.\n\nMcIntosh & Otis handle the subsidiary rights for Louisiana University Press and the University of Nebraska Press.\n\nOn September 12, 2013 McIntosh & Otis announced that they would handle the subsidiary rights for Rutgers University Press with respect to paperback reprints, audio, e-book, book club, foreign, film, TV and stage rights.\n\nIn June 2013, McIntosh & Otis filed a lawsuit against a literary agent formerly employed with them, Samuel Pinkus, in relation with another lawsuit that was filed against him by author Harper Lee, who claimed that Pinkus had duped her into handing over her copyright for her novel \"To Kill A Mockingbird\". McIntosh & Otis claimed a percentage of commissions Pinkus earned from clients he took with him when he left the company in 2004 but eventually settled the lawsuit in September 2013.\n"}

Her drawings, paintings, and sculptures focus on the representation of people, either in portraiture or as figures who embody aspects of her inner experience. She has been praised for her ability to articulate complex and profound emotion in her work. Among her art media are paint (oil and acrylic), ink, marker pen, papier-mâché, clay, and wood. She was a performance artist in the 1980s, and she plays guitar and violin.\n\nAlper is the subject of the documentary film \"Heaven Is a Traffic Jam on the 405\" (2016), which won the Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject) in 2018.\n\nAlper was born into a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York in 1959; she was the second of four children, and the only girl. When she was age two, her family moved to Los Angeles, where she has lived ever since. As a child, Alper had a phobia of touching others and of being touched, for fear that her touch was poisonous. By age four or five, she was drawing prolifically, and she found that drawing relieved her anxiety.\n\nAlper's parents hired visual artist Dorothy Cannon to tutor her in art. The lessons were in Cannon's home: a creatively decorated and inspiring place filled with music. For her students, Cannon read aloud nonsense verse by Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear. She worked with a variety of media, and introduced Alper to papier-mâché (a medium Alper was still using 50 years later). They made a mask together, and Alper continued making masks until she shifted her subject to people and the human form.\n\nAlper later attended an alternative school in Highland Park. In 1974, she began to learn puppet-making from marionettist Harry Burnett. Burnett, who was then in his mid-seventies, was spending his winter years teaching such skills to children, the elderly, and the disabled. \"I made really intricate marionettes that took me months to finish,\" Alper recalls. \"I wanted to have control over something and I had control of my marionettes—but, oddly enough, I never played with them. I always gave them away shortly after I finished them.\"\n\nIn 1976, Alper enrolled at Immaculate Heart College, a Catholic private college in Los Angeles, but she was distressed by the way the nuns treated her. In 1978 she transferred to Los Angeles City College, where she continued her education in art until 1983. In the mid-1980s, when Alper was 27, she suffered a mental breakdown and lost the ability to speak, write, or think in words. Eventually she was able to communicate by rearranging pre-printed words. In 1994, faced with crippling depression, Alper opted for electroconvulsive therapy, which left her with some parts of her brain permanently damaged.\n\nThrough all the changes in her life, Alper remained close to her first art teacher, Cannon, until Cannon's death in 1999. When Cannon died, Alper was at her bedside holding her hand. Some years later, she studied with painter and professor Susanna Maing of Occidental College. She also approached Bolivian-American painter Tom Wudl. Alper had an upcoming show, and was feeling very anxious about it. She was also afraid that she had lost her creativity. \"Tom promised me that we are creativity itself, and that he could help me find that in myself again,\" Alper said. Wudl invited her to study under him at no charge. Since then, she has worked with Wudl for several years.\n\nAmong Alper's art media are oil and acrylic paint, papier-mâché, clay, ink, and marker pen. When she eventually tired of papier-mâché, she began to study wood carving. She plays guitar and violin, and reports that all of her family members were musical. Her mother, she says, also aspired to be a painter, but hid her paintings from her children.\n\nAlper taught alongside her mentor, Cannon, off and on from 1976 to 1995. In the late 1970s she was a teaching assistant at Area H Alternative School, one of the first alternative schools in Los Angeles. In 1986 she taught art on a voluntary basis to terminally ill teenagers at Children's Hospital Los Angeles.\n\nIt was around this time that she met Marc Sirinsky, who was directing a theatre group called Imagination Workshop. His wife, Catherine Coulson (the \"Log Lady\" of \"Twin Peaks\" fame), became one of her students, and also a good friend. \"I got to know Mindy… when I came to have her help me draw a log, and we really connected,\" Coulson explains. During a period in 1992 when Alper lost the power of speech, Coulson acted as an intermediary to help her answer questions for an interview with Kristine McKenna. At the time of the interview, Sirinsky was working on a play intended to adapt Alper's drawings for the stage.\n\nSusan Arnold, a film producer and casting director, also met Alper through the Workshop. When she was producing \"Benny & Joon\" (1993), she arranged for Alper to help Mary Stuart Masterson prepare for her role as a mentally ill young woman who falls in love with a mime artist.\n\nAlper ceased giving private instruction in 2001. In 2006, she was a visiting artist at the California Institute of the Arts, for the benefit of an experimental drawing class there.\n\nFrom 1982 to 1989, Alper was active in the theatre: first as a member of a performance art and comedy group called the Love Machine, and then with the Buttersticks, a performance art troupe that she co-founded. In 1984, her papier-mâché work was featured in the journal \"Fiberarts\". She has exhibited her paintings and sculpture in several community venues around Los Angeles. After an exhibition at Random Gallery of Highland Park in 1988, she returned for a solo show in 1994, called \"Drawing on the Wrong Side of the Brain\", followed by a few group shows in the late 1990s. Among her other solo shows are Raddack Gallery in 1987, and Sincere Technologies Gallery of Oakland in 1989. Rosamund Felsen Gallery of Los Angeles, which has represented her since 2006, hosted shows for her in 2006, 2007, and 2013.\n\nThe 2006 and 2007 shows demonstrated Alper's drawings in ink and marker pen. In 2013, she exhibited alongside abstractionist painter Marcia Roberts. Alper's exhibit featured more than 20 pieces, including papier-mâché sculpture and ink drawing. In 2016 the gallery closed its space on Santa Fe Avenue in Downtown Los Angeles, and has operated as a website since then. The gallery's final group show, Celebration (2016), included three untitled Alper drawings in ink and marker pen.\n\nChamber musician Jay Hosler is the nephew of Dorothy Cannon, Alper's mentor, and has known Alper since she was about five years old. When he and fellow musician Peggy Harrison began writing children's literature together, Alper agreed to illustrate their first story: a chapter book called \"Norm and Burny: The Black Square\". \"The Black Square\" was published in 2013, and it includes 23 drawings. Its sequel, \"The Girl with the Gold Coin\" (2014), is also illustrated by Alper. In the books, Norm is a 12-year-old boy who goes on adventures with his (somewhat wiser) canine companion, Burny.\n\nAlper's work is representational. While she sometimes paints or sculpts portraits, much of her output comprises line drawings and paintings that are expressive of her emotional state, or which evidence the workings of the unconscious. Her figures are human (or humanoid), and sometimes anthropomorphic. Cannon recalled that, as a child, Alper had \"an unusual capacity for dipping into her subconscious and doing drawings from that point of view\"; she described Alper's memory as \"photographic\". Journalist and art curator Kristine McKenna esteemed Alper's work from early childhood as \"remarkably sophisticated in their technical polish and psychological complexity\". Writing in 2018, film critic Richard Brody was impressed by Alper's ability to capture powerful emotion and potent memories with such precision and sincerity. He found her portraits to be \"brilliant [and] moving\".\n\nDuring a ten-year period when she lost the power of speech for long stretches, her work changed: \"I was very prolific with my drawing,\" Alper says, \"and I think that I was telling more complete stories—maybe because I so desperately was trying to communicate.\"\n\nWhile studying at Tom Wudl Studio in the 2010s, Alper caught the attention of B. J. Dockweiler, a fellow painter and classmate. Dockweiler was fascinated by Alper's work and disposition. Dockweiler's husband, Frank Stiefel, was equally intrigued when he met Alper at a group show and saw some of her pieces. He talked with Alper occasionally, as they attended some of the same art openings. He asked if he could film her as she worked on one of her newest pieces: a monumental bust of her therapist, Shoshana Gerson. After a few months of filming, Stiefel interviewed Alper on camera; five more interviews followed, and Alper's story emerged. The film, \"Heaven Is a Traffic Jam on the 405\", premiered at the Austin Film Festival in 2016, where it won the Jury Award and the Audience Award in the \"Documentary Short\" category. The Jury Award qualified the film for an Academy Award nomination. At the 90th Academy Awards in 2018, it won the Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject).\n"}

{"id": "45438", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45438", "title": "Painterliness", "text": "Painterliness\n\nPainterliness is a concept based on the German term (painterly), a word popularized by Swiss art historian Heinrich Wölfflin (1864–1945) to help focus, enrich and standardize the terms being used by art historians of his time to characterize works of art. It is the opposite of linear, plastic or formal linear design.\n\nAn oil painting is painterly when there are visible brushstrokes, the result of applying paint in a less than completely controlled manner, generally without closely following carefully drawn lines. Works characterized as either painterly or linear can be produced with any painting media: oils, acrylics, watercolors, gouache, etc. Some artists whose work could be characterized as painterly are Pierre Bonnard, Francis Bacon, Vincent van Gogh, Rembrandt, Renoir, and John Singer Sargent. In watercolor it might be represented by the early watercolors of Andrew Wyeth.\n\nIn contrast, \"linear\" could describe the painting of artists such as Botticelli, Michelangelo, and Ingres, whose works depend on creating the illusion of a degree of three-dimensionality by means of \"modeling the form\" through skillful drawing, shading, and an academic rather than impulsive use of color. Contour and pattern are more in the province of the linear artists, while dynamism is the most common trait of painterly works.\n\nThe Impressionists, Fauvists and the Abstract Expressionists tended strongly to be painterly movements.\n\nPainterly art often makes use of the many visual effects produced by paint on canvas such as chromatic progression, warm and cool tones, complementary and contrasting colors, broken tones, broad brushstrokes, sketchiness, and impasto.\n\nAlthough \"painterly\" generally refers to a certain use of paint in art, it happens that some forms of sculpture make use of apparently random surface effects which, if not exactly resembling brushstrokes, contain the traits of painterliness. The application of the term \"painterly\" outside of painting may help the viewer or listener experience more deeply the significance of Auguste Rodin's surfaces or Richard Strauss's flow of chromatic harmonies.\n\n\"Painterly\" is used to describe computer software, especially mobile apps, designed to create special effects on photographs, mimicking recognizably artistic styles such as oils, watercolors, Japanese woodcuts, etc., or based on styles like van Gogh or Monet, and so on. The resulting photographs are also called \"painterly.\" \n\n"}

James outlined for his superiors the cost of a complete reproduction of Domesday Book (an estimate of £1575 for 500 copies or £3.3s per copy) using his process. In addition to this James further outlined the cost of a single county to demonstrate the affordability of the process, using Cornwall as an example of one of the shorter entries in the volumes (eleven folio pages) and estimated the cost of 500 copies to be £11. 2s. 4d. In doing so he selected the first extract of Domesday Book that he would photozincograph.\n\nOn 24 January 1861, Sir Henry was granted permission to photozincograph the Cornwall fragment of Domesday as a Treasury funded experiment to determine the success of the process. Joseph Burtt, one of the Assistant Keepers of the Records was directed to assist the Record Office binder, Hood, to unbind the relevant pages from Domesday and on Monday 4 February 1861 Burtt transported Domesday to Southampton by train.\n\nOn arrival at the Ordnance Survey offices in Southampton, Burtt expressed his satisfaction with the buildings' \"fireproof principles, and…military guard\", and was given use of the best room in the building in which Domesday was placed in a fireproof safe, and the key entrusted to Burtt. Burtt’s description of the preparations extends to the actual photozincographic process, including James’s insistence that all plates should be developed and printed before the folios were returned. Nevertheless, the photozincography of Cornwall was completed in 11 days and Burtt returned to London. The process was carried out in the Ordnance Survey photography building nicknamed the glasshouse.\n\nHaving completed Cornwall, James requested permission to photozincograph the rest of Domesday. Despite his claim that the public sale of the bound and engraved copies could cover the entire cost of the photozincography of the counties, the Lords of the Treasury wished to consult the Master of the Rolls regarding the comparison of James’s photozincographic reproductions with a rival process employed by Rev. Lambert Larking of Kent. Larking (a local antiquarian) had employed an artist to assist the reproduction of the county of Kent using the lithographic process - a much more expensive means of reproduction than photozincography. However, in order to secure this permission over Larking's process James had to provide the Treasury with evidence of public interest and a guarantee of low-cost production. Thomas Letts of Letts Son & Co. Limited, London distributed a circular nationally bearing a foreword from James encouraging subscription, and by late October more than fifty subscribers to each county had been amassed. On 28 November 1861 Burtt returned to Southampton once more with Domesday for the aforementioned counties’ photozincographing, and by December James had secured permission from the Treasury to copy the remainder of Great Domesday – but he was explicitly forbidden from reproducing Kent, in defence of Larking’s lithograph. By 1864 the facsimile of the entirety of Great Domesday had been completed, and had been published in 32 county volumes including Kent following Larking's death, who granted James permission to complete the reproduction of the county due to his infirmity in the final stages of his life. \n\nThe volumes were published in two colours (red and black), replicating the colours used in the original manuscript.\n\n\"The books which were printed by James's method are still sought after even if they are not up to the standard of later facsimiles. His edition of \"Domesday Book\" is still the only facsimile of it available and can be found reasonably cheaply, whereas the letterpress is extremely rare and very expensive.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "57062676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57062676", "title": "Portrayal of female bodies in Chinese contemporary art", "text": "Portrayal of female bodies in Chinese contemporary art\n\nPortrayal of female bodies in Chinese contemporary art has become a lot more diverse as women artists start to rise in China. Many contemporary Chinese women artists have employed the use of female bodies as the subject of their artworks. From the ancient and imperial period of China until early the 19th century, women's body images in Chinese art were predominantly portrayed through male artists' lenses. As a result, female bodies were often misrepresented. With the arrival of modernism in Chinese contemporary art, women now have more influences in the field of visual arts. Chinese women artists employ unconventional artistic expressions in order to speak about their experiences of being a female and an artist in a patriarchal society. Although the Chinese visual art field has been more inclusive in the recent decades, women artists’ representation in major art exhibitions is still significantly less than male artists. Therefore, artists and curators have made a joint effort to devote certain art exhibitions to just Chinese women artists.\n\nTraditionally, female bodies were only valued as carriers for the family bloodline. In traditional paintings, nude women were a taboo for the artists. As a result, the portrayal of women's bodies was formulaic, always with slim figures, usually leaning on another object or have a slightly bent posture to further emphasize their delicate bodies.\n\nFemale images would also demonstrate ideal qualities of women at that time. Aside from feminine beauty and charm, she should also possess the virtues of subordinating herself in a Confucian patriarchal society. Therefore, women in these ancient paintings all wore long silk skirts that came down to the ankles. They could only show the part of their body above their chest. Their appearance, combined with their slender body figures, showed the submissive and demure qualities, which was desirable for male audiences.\n\nA drastic change in ideal femininity occurred in 1966 and 1967 when the Cultural Revolution in China took place. The Cultural Revolution, led by Mao Zedong, denounced the traditional image of women's inferiority and calls for a women's liberation in the new China. Propaganda tools, such as performance art, films, and posters, strongly supported this movement and effectively constructed and broadcast a new female identity. Feminine beauty was no longer characterized by delicate figures, but instead by masculinized images of women. For example, \"Iron girls\" represented the permissible appearances of women in the 1970s. They should not wear anything that showed their female curves. Moreover, women were encouraged to dress like men and go to work like men did, given that Mao called for a \"gender erasure\" in order to make \"Chinese women in new China.\"\n\nSimilar to \"Iron Girls,\" \"Strong Women\" images were popularized through mass media, such as cartoons and local newspapers. Their appearance was defined by masculinized traits: tanned skin tone, sturdy figures, and blue and black work uniforms. Feminine features, like smooth skin and hands, were seen as something to be ashamed of because they were expected to be contributing to the nation's economy like men did.\n\nIn her installation series, \"Trauma\", Hung Liu portrays a bound-foot woman. Foot binding was practiced among Chinese women from the Song dynasty up until the early 20th century. Women would wrap their feet tightly in order to keep them small, which was characterized as a feminine beauty at the time. In Liu's installation pieces, she repeatedly shows an emotionless woman with her naked feet. As a result of the foot binding cultural, these women had deformed feet.\n\nFeng Jiali is famous for her oil painting of explicit images of female bodies. A series of her paintings depict young, school-aged Chinese girls, usually skimpily dressed in the bath or laying in bed. The girls in her paintings almost always look directly at the viewers, some innocent-looking, some with a confrontational gaze.\n\nAnother series of her works involves photographs of her pregnant body. By revealing her own pregnant body fearlessly in front of the camera, she challenges the traditional views of pregnant body as something private and a mean to continue the family line, favoring boys over girls, and following the one-child policy. Because pregnant nude is normally not defined as the ideal beauty found in female bodies, Feng’s photo collage expresses another aspect of being a woman. She desired to express the hardships and anxieties of being pregnant, which contradicts with the conventional, sacred portrayal of childbirth by many male artists.\n\nCai Jin, another contemporary oil painter, also challenges the traditional taboos of nudity in ancient Chinese art history. Unlike Feng Jiali, however, Cai articulates female bodies in a semi-abstract way by using organic elements in her paintings. A series of her paintings depict women's bodies shaped like banana tree leaves. Unlike many conventional portrayals of the female body that serves in the interest of male audiences, Cai painted the bodies like decomposed flesh, which is then metamorphosed into dripping, red, banana leaves.\n\nTraditionally, plants, especially flowers, are associated with femininity. However, Cai made a modern twist on this subject and made it into a somewhat unpleasant-looking and distorted image, rejecting the stereotypical delicate women and flowers association. Like how Feng declared that pregnant bodies can be art too, Cai had made an assertion that although women's bodies aren't always going to be maintained in a perfect way, they can still become a form of art.\n\nIn \"Opening of the Great Wall\", He Chengyao presented her own naked body in a public space in 2001 and took a series of photographs of herself. The photographs documented her walking confidently with her upper body being nude. She held her bright red bra on her right hand and tied her sweater around the waist. She had a deadpan expression on her face and a confident posture as she walks toward the camera. The photo was taken on the Great Wall of China, which is one of the most popular scenic spots in Beijing, China.\n\nDespite the fact that she was surrounded by many curious tourists, He still maintained a confident look. She had also spontaneously joined in an installation by a male artist, H.A. Schult, which was exhibited on the Great Wall at the same time. Whether intended or not, she had made her appearance as a Chinese women artist in the mainstream of male art production. Furthermore, although her piece took place in 2001, women's nudity in public spaces was still considered taboo at the time.\n\nHe Chengyao completed this performance art piece in 2004 at the Shanghai Doland Museum of Modern Art, which combined the themes of body and identity. As the title of the piece suggested, He Chengyao performed a series of exercises in front of a large group of audiences, while her naked body was tightly wrapped with tape. Her movement caused the tape to be ripped apart one by one. She also wrapped her self with the sticky side of the tape out, which made her body parts stuck together and making it increasingly harder to perform the exercise.\n\nXiang Jing is a Beijing-based sculptor. She is best known for her depiction of realistic nude women sculptures. One of her sculptures, \"Your Body\", portrays a nude and bald woman slumping in a chair with her legs spread open. There's a prominent scar on the right side of her abdomen. She has sagging breasts, belly fat rolls, and blank expression on her face. None of these qualities fall under the expectation of the ideal female body.\n\nThough efforts have been made in order to make the visual art field more inclusive, women's artworks have still been underrepresented in major exhibitions. In the late 1980s, when the first major Chinese Art exhibition took place, only five women, out of sixty-seven artists and participants, were included in the show. While artists from mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, were being recognized for their diverse identities, women artists' participation in this first Chinese exhibition were not acknowledged.\n\nSimilarly, in the traveling exhibition, \"Transience: Chinese Experimental Art at the End of Twentieth Century\" in 1998, only three women artists presented their artworks. The curator of this exhibition, Wu Hung, intended to provide a platform for experimental Chinese art to take place. However, it appears that women's innovative artistic expressions were still being excluded and didn't gain as many recognition as male Chinese artists have had.\n\nThe issue of unequal representation among male and female Chinese artists did receive some attention from the public. As a result, curators and artists have made a joint effort to devote certain exhibition and publications solely for female artists.\n\n\"Century Women\" was one of the first exhibitions dedicated to Chinese women artists. It intended to raise awareness on female experiences, roles, subject matters, and most importantly, art practices through the perspective of women living in contemporary Chinese society. In addition to providing a platform to showcase artworks made by Chinese women, it also exhibited photos and documents showing women's art production in China. More than seventy artists participated in this exhibition and presented over five hundred pieces of artworks\n\nThis exhibition was held concurrently around the world, such as China, Singapore, Germany, and the United States, to spread pan-Asian feminist artworks. Specifically, the show in New York, \"Against the Tide (1998),\" featured five female artists who were born in China and grew up during the Cultural Revolution. Cai Jin, who also participated in this show, presented her Banana Plant series in the show, which is a suggestive form of presenting female nude bodies in a public space.\n\nList of Chinese women artists\n"}

When it was disbanded in 1976, the RAAs came under the then Deputy Secretary General, Angus Stirling, until 1980 when a Regional Department was formed. \n\nThe Wilding report of 1989 recommended the RAAs should be replaced as there was significant differences in distribution of funding between different regions. They were replaced by 10 \"Regional Arts Boards\" (RABs) in 1990.. The new Boards received the majority of their funding directly from the Arts Council rather than local sources. This changed the nature and structure of regional arts. These were independent non-profit limited by guarantee companies with some local authority representation on their management boards, but the democratic role and the link between subscription and governance was broken. Payment of a subscription did not guarantee a seat or a vote.\n\nAfter the Arts Council of Great Britain was abolished in 1994, the RABs were transferred to a new single body: Arts Council England. In 2001 it was announced that the RABS would be abolished in an effort to streamline the administration of Arts Council England.. The Boards closed in April 2002 and smaller regional offices were maintained in the regions, except the South East Board which became part of southern region,\nto bring them into line with the then [[regional development agency areas.\n\n\n\n[[Category:Arts councils of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Arts organisations based in England]]\n[[Category:Arts organizations established in 1990]]\n[[Category:Arts organizations disestablished in 2002]]\n[[Category:Defunct public bodies of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:1900 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:2002 disestablishments in England]]\n"}

It was made in 1981 as a fusion of two readymades and launched Arad's career. The chair is a postmodernist design, combining a car seat with a structural tubing frame.\n\nArad had left his employment with a firm of architects, and obtained the parts to make the chair from a scrapyard in Chalk Farm, London. The readymade chair was the first piece of furniture he produced.\n\nThe red leather seat is from a Rover P6 and is housed in a black painted curved steel frame made from a Kee Klamp milking stall. Later exhibited pieces had epoxy lacquered frames. The frame provides both feet and arm rests.\n\nThe Rover P6 is sometimes known as the 2000. Some reports of the chair refer to it being made using seats from the 200, P5 or 90.\n\nFurniture maker Joe Hall visited Arad's Covent Garden shop in the and then collaborated with him to make further chairs. Hall scoured the country's scrapyards for P6 seats, which cost £5£15 each and were in excellent condition.\n\nThe chairs sold for £99 each in 1981, about three times the production cost. Original chairs made by Arad's One Off company have been auctioned by Christie's, Bonhams, Bonhams & Butterfield and Göteborgs Auktionsverk. Hundreds have been produced since 1981, fetching thousands of pounds at auctions at the turn of the century. The success of the chair, which has become an icon, launched Arad's career.\n\nThe chairs were produced by One Off until 1989, and in 2008 were being produced by Vitra in two models. A two-seater version was auctioned in 2011.\n\nFashion designer Jean Paul Gaultier bought six chairs in 1981, while they also attracted the attention of furniture manufacturer Vitra. The chair is recognised as a postmodernist design.\n\nA presenter of BBC Television's Top Gear sat on such a chair from 1988. The chair also featured in a television advertisement for an unrelated product. Arad's own children were breast-fed on the chair.\n\nThe chair has formed part of various exhibitions, including those at London's Design Museum, Barbican Art Gallery, Timothy Taylor Gallery, Paris's Centre Pompidou and New York's Museum of Modern Art.\n"}

{"id": "431845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=431845", "title": "Stippling", "text": "Stippling\n\nStippling is the creation of a pattern simulating varying degrees of solidity or shading by using small dots. Such a pattern may occur in nature and these effects are frequently emulated by artists.\n\nIn a drawing or painting, the dots are made of pigment of a single colour, applied with a pen or brush; the denser the dots, the darker the apparent shade—or lighter, if the pigment is lighter than the surface. This is similar to—but distinct from—pointillism, which uses dots of different colours to simulate blended colours.\n\nIn printmaking, dots may be carved out of a surface to which ink will be applied, to produce either a greater or lesser density of ink depending on the printing technique. In engraving, the technique was invented by Giulio Campagnola in about 1510. Stippling may also be used in engraving or sculpting an object even when there is no ink or paint involved, either to change the texture of the object, or to produce the appearance of light or dark shading depending on the reflective properties of the surface: for instance, stipple engraving on glass produces areas that appear brighter than the surrounding glass.\n\nThe technique became popular as a means of producing shaded line art illustrations for publication, because drawings created this way could be reproduced in simple black ink. The other common method is hatching, which uses lines instead of dots. Stippling has traditionally been favoured over hatching in biological and medical illustration, since it is less likely than hatching to interfere visually with the structures being illustrated (the lines used in hatching can be mistaken for actual contours), and also since it allows the artist to vary the density of shading more subtly to depict curved or irregular surfaces.\n\nImages produced by halftoning or dithering and computer printers operate on similar principles (varying the size and/or spacing of dots on paper), but do so via photographic or digital processes rather than manually. These newer techniques have made it possible to convert continuous-tone images into patterns suitable for printing, but artists may still choose stippling for its simplicity and handmade appearance. \"The Wall Street Journal\" still features stippled and hatched portraits known as hedcuts (a style brought to the WSJ by Kevin Sprouls in 1987) in its pages, a holdover from its earlier avoidance of photographs.\n\nIn description of flora species, a stippling is a kind of pattern, especially in the case of flowering plants, produced in nature that occur on flower petals and sepals. These are similar to the dot patterns in artworks that produce an often intricate pattern. An example can be seen on the base of the petal insides of \"Calochortus luteus\", a lily endemic to California.\n\nThe term stipple can also apply to a random pattern of small depressions applied to a surface to increase the friction and make the surface easier to grip. This process is similar to knurling or checkering, but is often used on complex curved surfaces, such as anatomical grips, where a regular pattern would not fit. Stippling can be cast into plastic objects, or applied with a hammer and punch to wood or metal objects.\n\nA further use of stipple indicates the damage caused by spider mites which make tiny white spots on plant leaves which can coalesce until the entire leaf appears silvery.\n\nIn quilt making, the term refers to background quilting in heirloom quilts and all-over stitching in others. It is made freehand or with free-motion machine quilting by densely stitching through all layers in a relatively close repetitive design.\n\nIn interior decoration, the tips of the bristles of a stippling brush are dabbed onto a freshly painted wall or surface to create a subtle design in the paint. The paint hit by the points is displaced and leaves only a thin dot of paint through which a lighter layer of colour underneath will show through.\n\nIn digital photography, stippling refers to image noise similar to film grain.\n\nIn forensic science, stippling refers to a pattern of gunshot residue burned into the skin that results from close proximity to a discharged firearm. \n"}
{"id": "2658000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2658000", "title": "Street art", "text": "Street art\n\nStreet art is visual art created in public locations, usually unsanctioned artwork executed outside of the context of traditional art vans. Other terms for this type of art include \"independent public art\", \"post-graffiti\", and \"neon-graffiti\", and is closely related with urban outfiters and guerrilla art. Common forms and media include spray paint graffiti, stencil graffiti, wheatpasted poster art, sticker art, street installations, and sculpture. Video projection and yarn bombing have also gained some popularity near the turn of the 21st century.\n\nStreet art is a form of artwork that is displayed in a community on its surrounding buildings, streets, trains, and other publicly viewed surfaces. Many instances come in the form of guerrilla art, which is composed to make a public statement about the society that the artist lives within. The work has moved from the beginnings of graffiti and vandalism to new modes where artists work to bring messages, or just simple beauty, to an audience.\n\nSome artists use \"smart vandalism\" as a way to raise awareness of social and political issues. Others simply see urban space as an untapped format for personal artwork, while others may appreciate the challenges and risks that are associated with installing illicit artwork in public places. A common motive is that creating art in a format which utilizes public space allows artists who may otherwise feel disenfranchised to reach a much broader audience than other styles or galleries would allow.\n\nWhereas traditional graffiti artists have primarily used spray paint to produce their work, \"street art\" encompasses many other media, such as LED art, mosaic tiling, stencil art, sticker art, reverse graffiti, \"Lock On\" sculptures, street installations, wheatpasting, woodblocking, yarn bombing, and rock balancing. New media forms such as projection onto large city buildings are an increasingly popular tool for street artists—and the availability of cheap hardware and software allows street artists to become more competitive with corporate advertisements. Much like open source software, artists are able to create art for the public realm from their personal computers, similarly creating things for free which compete with companies making things for profit.\n\nSome observers use the term \"independent public art\" to describe a type of street art, which can also include work in remote places that may not be visited by an audience, and may also be short-lived. An ephemeral instance of colored smoke in the forest, or a precarious rock balance are examples. Some work has been installed underwater.\n\nSlogans of protest and political or social commentary graffitied onto public walls are the precursor to modern graffiti and street art, and continue as one aspect of the genre. Street art in the form of text or simple iconic graphics in the vein of corporate icons become well-known yet enigmatic symbols of an area or an era. Some credit the \"Kilroy Was Here\" graffiti of the World War II era as one such early example; a simple line-drawing of a long-nosed man peering from behind a ledge. Author Charles Panati indirectly touched upon the general appeal of street art in his description of the \"Kilroy\" graffiti as \"outrageous not for what it said, but where it turned up\". Much of what can now be defined as modern street art has well-documented origins dating from New York City's graffiti boom, with its infancy in the 1960s, maturation in the 1970s, and peaking with the spray-painted full-car subway train murals of the 1980s centered in the Bronx.\n\nAs the 1980s progressed, a shift occurred from text-based works of early in the decade to visually conceptual street art such as Hambleton's shadow figures. This period coincides with Keith Haring's subway advertisement subversions and Jean-Michel Basquiat's SAMO tags. What is now recognized as \"street art\" had yet to become a realistic career consideration, and offshoots such as stencil graffiti were in their infancy. Wheatpasted poster art used to promote bands and the clubs where they performed evolved into actual artwork or copy-art and became a common sight during the 1980s in cities worldwide.\nThe group working collectively as AVANT were also active in New York during this period. Punk rock music's subversive ideologies were also instrumental to street art's evolution as an art form during the 1980s. Some of the anti-museum mentality can be attributed to the ideology of Marinetti who in 1909 wrote the \"Manifesto of Futurism\" with a quote that reads, \"\"we will destroy all the museums\".\" Many street artists claim we do not live in a museum so art should be in public places with no tickets.\n\nThe northwest wall of the intersection at Houston Street and the Bowery in New York City has been a target of artists since the 1970s. The site, now sometimes referred to as the Bowery Mural, originated as a derelict wall which graffiti artists used freely. Keith Haring once commandeered the wall for his own use in 1982. After Haring, a stream of well-known street artists followed, until the wall had gradually taken on prestigious status. By 2008, the wall became privately managed and made available to artists by commission or invitation only.\n\nA series of murals by René Moncada began appearing on the streets of SoHo in the late 1970s emblazoned with the words \"I AM THE BEST ARTIST\". René has described the murals as a thumb in the nose to the art community he felt he'd helped pioneer but by which he later felt ignored by. Recognized as an early act of \"art provocation\", they were a topic of conversation and debate at the time, and related legal conflicts raised discussion about intellectual property, artist's rights, and the First Amendment. The ubiquitous murals also became a popular backdrop to photographs taken by tourists and art students, and for advertising layouts and Hollywood films.\n\"IATBA\" murals were often defaced, only to be repainted by René.\n\nSome street artists have earned international attention for their work and have made a full transition from street art into the mainstream art world — some while continuing to produce art on the streets. Keith Haring was among the earliest wave of street artists in the 1980s to do so. Traditional graffiti and street art motifs have also increasingly been incorporated into mainstream advertising, with many instances of artists contracted to work as graphic designers for corporations. Graffiti artist Haze has provided font and graphic designs for music acts such as the Beastie Boys and Public Enemy. Shepard Fairey's street posters of then-presidential candidate Barack Obama were reworked by special commission for use in the presidential campaign. A version of the artwork also appeared on the cover of \"Time\" magazine. It is also not uncommon for street artists to start their own merchandising lines.\n\nStreet art has become more accepted by the general public, likely due to its artistic recognition and the high-profile status of Banksy and other artists. This has led street art to become one of the 'sights to see' in many European cities. Some artists now provide tours of local street art and are able to share their knowledge, explaining the ideas behind many works, the reasons for tagging and the messages portrayed in a lot of graffiti work. \nBerlin, London, Paris, Hamburg and other cities all have popular street art tours running all year round. In London alone there are supposedly ten different graffiti tours available for tourists. Many of these organisations, such as Alternative London, ParisStreetArt, AlternativeBerlin, pride themselves on working with local artists, so visitors can get an authentic experience and not just a rehearsed script.\n\nMany of these guides are painters, fine-art graduates and other creative professionals that have found the medium of street art as a way to exhibit their work. With this commercial angle they are able to let people in to the world of street art and give them more of an understanding of where it comes from. It has been argued that this growing popularity of steet art has made it a factor in gentrification.\n\nStreet art can have its own set of legal issues. The parties involved can include the artist, the city or municipal government, the intended recipient, and the owner of the structure or the medium where the work was displayed. One example is a case in 2014 in Bristol England, which exhibits the legal, moral, and ethical questions that can result. The \"Mobile Lovers\" by Banksy was painted on plywood on a public doorway, then cut out by a citizen who in turn was going to sell the piece to garner funds for a Boys Club. The City government in turn confiscated the artwork and placed it in a museum. Banksy, hearing of the conundrum then bequeathed it to the original citizen, thinking his intentions were genuine. In this case, as in others, the controversy of ownership and public property, as well as the issues of trespassing and vandalism are issues to be resolved legally.\n\nGraffiti is characteristically made up of written words that are meant to represent a group or community in a covert way and in plain sight. The tell tale sign of street art is that it usually includes images, illustrations, or symbols that are meant to convey a message. While both works are meant to represent or tell a message to viewers, one difference between the two comes in the specific viewers that it is meant for. One trait of street art that has helped to bring it to positive light in the public eye is that the messages shown in these public spaces are usually made to be understandable to all.\n\nWhile both of these types of art have many differences, there are more similarities than their origins. Both graffiti and street art are works of art that are created with the same intent. Most artists, whether they are working anonymously, creating an intentionally incomprehensible message, or fighting for some greater cause are working with the same ambitions for popularity, recognition, and the public display or outpouring of their personal thoughts, feelings, and/or passions.\n\nThe term street art is described in many different ways, one of which is the term \"guerrilla art.\" Both terms describe these public works that are placed with meaning and intent. They can be done anonymously for works that are created to confront taboo public issues that will result in backlash, or under the name of a well-known artist. With any terminology, these works of art are created as a primary way to express the artist's thoughts on many topics and public issues.\n\nOne defining trait or feature of street art is that it is created on or in a public area without or against the permission of the owner. This is a trait which falls in line with that of graffiti. A main distinction between the two comes in the second trait of street art or guerrilla art, where it is made to represent and display a purposefully uncompliant act that is meant to challenge its surrounding environment. This challenge can be granular, focusing on issues within the community or broadly sweeping, addressing global issues on a public stage.\n\nThis is how the term \"guerilla art\" was associated with this type of work and behavior. The word ties back to guerilla warfare in history where attacks are made wildly, without control, and with no rules of engagement. This type of warfare was dramatically different than the previously formal and traditional fighting that went on in wars normally. When used in the context of street art, the term guerilla art is meant to give nod to the artist's uncontrolled, unexpected, and often unnamed attack on societal structure or norms.\n\nGuerilla sculpture is the placement of sculptures in street settings without official approval; it developed from street art in England in the late 20th century. In addition to the nontraditional setting of the works of art involved, there are also many different techniques used in the creation of this art work. The artists tend to work illegally and in secrecy to create and place these works in the dark of night, cloaked in mystery regarding their origins and creators. The sculptures are used to express the artist's views and to reach an audience that would not otherwise be reached through more traditional methods of displaying one's work to the public. In performing these acts of artistic expression, they are not working to gain acceptance or love of the people that they reach, but at times may even anger those who view their work.\n\nAn example is the overnight appearance of an unsanctioned sculpture of Edward Snowden onto a column in Fort Greene Park in New York City. In other cases the sculptures integrate two-dimensional backdrops with a three-dimensional component, such as one by Banksy titled \"Spy Booth\" (2014). The backdrop was painted on a wall in Cheltenham, England and featured Cold-War spy characters adorned in trench coats and fedoras, with spy accoutrements, microphones, and reel-to-reel tape decks. These characters appeared to be tapping into a broken telephone booth.\n\nA deviation from unsanctioned street sculpture is \"institutionalized guerilla sculpture\", which is sanctioned by civic authorities and can be commercialized. One such artist from the Netherlands is Florentijn Hofman, who in 2007 created \"Rubber Duck\", a colossal rendition of the childhood tub-toy. The Guardians of Time guerrilla dOCUMENTA are social sculptures by Manfred Kielnhofer.\nAlthough this type of art has become a staple of most cities around the world, the popularity of this form of artistic expression was not always so apparent as it is today. In recent years, street art has undergone a major transformation in public opinion to even become a socially accepted and respected accent to the public places that they adorn. Even with this push for public acceptance, the act of defacing public property with any and all message, whether it is considered art or not, has yet to become permitted or approved by the government. Today's street art, while common and growing in acceptance, is largely placed in a middle ground between an act that is against the law and a beautifully respected act of artistic expression.\n\nIn the beginning, graffiti was the only form of street art that there was and it was widely considered to be a delinquent act of territorial marking and crude messaging. Initially, there was very clear divisions between the work of a street artist and the act of tagging a public or private property, but in recent years where the artists are treading the line between the two, this line has become increasingly blurred. Those who truly appreciate the work of famed street artists or street works of art, are in acceptance of the fact that this art would not be the same without the medium being the street. The works are subject to whatever change or destruction may come due to the fact that they are created on public or private surfaces which are neither owned by the artist or permitted to be worked on by the property owners. This acceptance of the potential impermanence of the works of art and the public placement of the uncondoned works are what contribute to the meaning of the piece and therefore, what helps the growth of street art popularity.\n\nThe free art movement is the practice of artists leaving art in public places as street art, as well as being free for the public to remove and keep. The artwork is usually tagged with a notice stating it is free art, and either with the artist's name or left anonymously. The movement was reinvigorated by British artist My Dog Sighs coining the term \"Free Art Fridays\" and actively participating in the movement, which has since spread internationally. Clues to the location of artworks are sometimes left on social media to combine treasure hunting with art.\n\nThe movement is distinct from the free culture movement as the artist retains full copyright for the work.\n\nStreet art exists worldwide. Large cities and regional towns of the world are home to some form of street art community, from which pioneering artists or forerunners of particular mediums or techniques emerge. Internationally known street artists travel between such locations to promote and exhibit their artwork.\n\nNew York City attracts artists from around the world.\nIn Manhattan, \"post-graffiti\" street art grew in the 1980s from the then largely vacant neighborhoods of SoHo and the Lower East Side. The Chelsea art district became another locale, with area galleries also hosting formal exhibitions of street artist's work. In Brooklyn, the Williamsburg and Dumbo neighborhoods — especially near the waterfront — are recognized street art sites.\n\nPrograms in the Pennsylvania cities of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh provide funding to agencies who employ street artists to decorate city walls. The Mural Arts Program established in 1984 has helped Philadelphia earn praise as the \"City of Murals\".\nThe project was initiated to encourage graffiti artists toward a more constructive use of their talents. Murals backed by The Sprout Fund in Pittsburgh were named the \"Best Public Art\" by the \"Pittsburgh City Paper\" in 2006.\n\nStreet art in Atlanta centers on the Old Fourth Ward and Reynoldstown neighborhoods, the Krog Street Tunnel, and along the 22-mile BeltLine railway corridor which circles the inner city. Atlanta established a Graffiti Task Force in 2011. Although the city selected a number of murals which would not be targeted by the task force, the selection process overlooked street art of the popular Krug Street Tunnel site. Art created in conjunction with the Living Walls street art conference, which Atlanta hosts annually, were spared. Some actions taken by the unit, including arrests of artists deemed vandals, caused community opposition; some considered the city's efforts as \"misdirected\" or \"futile\". After being sued by a group of artists in 2017 the city of Atlanta agreed not to enforce an ordinance requiring artists to obtain city approval for murals on private property. Images and locations of over 200 works of Atlanta street art can be found on the Atlanta Street Art Map.\n\nSarasota, Florida, hosts an annual street art event, the Sarasota Chalk Festival, founded in 2007.\nAn independent offshoot known as \"Going Vertical\" sponsors works by street artists, but some have been removed as controversial.\n\nThe Los Angeles neighborhood of Hollywood and streets such as Sunset Boulevard, La Brea, Beverly Boulevard, La Cienega, and Melrose Avenue are among key locations. LAB ART Los Angeles, opened in 2011, devotes its 6,500 square feet of gallery space to street art. Artwork by locals such as Alec Monopoly, Annie Preece, Smear and Morley are among the collection.\n\nSan Francisco's Mission District has densely packed street art along Mission Street, and along both Clarion and Balmy Alleys.\nStreets of Hayes Valley, SoMa, Bayview-Hunters Point and the Tenderloin have also become known for street art.\nSan Diego's East Village, Little Italy, North Park, and South Park neighborhoods contain street artwork of VHILS, Shepard Fairey, Tavar Zawacki a.k.a. ABOVE, Space Invader, Os Gêmeos, among others. Murals by various Mexican artists can be seen at Chicano Park in the Barrio Logan neighborhood.\n\nMontreal (Canada) With over 80 murals and counting since the foundation of MURAL Festival in 2013, the annual street art festival contributed in creating Le Plateau-Mont-Royal as an epicentre for urban arts. Villeray, Downtown Montreal Le Sud-Ouest, Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, and multiple art districts also continue to broaden the street art circuit within the Island of Montreal.\n\nToronto (Canada) has a significant graffiti scene.\n\nRichmond, Virginia has over 100 murals created by artists, many of whom are alumni of Virginia Commonwealth University's School of the Arts or current students there. Some of the murals are privately commissioned by individuals and businesses, some are created by solo street artists, and some are collaborative group fund-raising projects.\n\nDenver street artists have been busy brightening (and enlightening) the urban landscape for decades by making canvases of the city's alleyways, building exteriors, warehouses, garage doors and storefronts. The city of Denver has a whole area called the River North Art District (RiNo) that is dedicated to the work of local creative artists. Most artists in the RiNo district are commissioned by the local business owners who want to give their buildings colorful imagery. \nBuenos Aires has developed a reputation for its large scale murals and artworks in many subway stations and public spaces. The first graffiti artists started painting in street in the Argentine capital in the mid-1990s after visiting other countries in Europe and South America. One of the first recognized street artists in Argentina is Alfredo Segatori, nicknamed 'Pelado', who began painting in 1994 and holds the record for the longest mural in Argentina measuring more than 2000m2.\n\nSão Paulo is also home to an internationally recognized street art scene.\n\nAn abundance of buildings slated for demolition provide blank canvases to a multitude of artists, and the authorities cannot keep up with removing artists output. \"Population density\" and \"urban anxiety\" are common motifs expressed by \"Grafiteiros\" in their street art and \"pichação\", rune-like black graffiti, said to convey feelings of class conflict.\n\nInfluential Brazilian street artists include Claudio Ethos, Os Gêmeos, Vitche, Onesto, and Herbert Baglione.\n\nBogotá Has lot of walls dedicated to street art and a powerful artistic movements. The tourist can appreciate several wall performances around 26 street (), \n\nRecently, Bogotá's street art suffered persecution by local and municipal governments that erase works in several public and private walls arguing vandalic acts, private property damage and visual contamination.\n\nLondon has become one of the most pro-graffiti cities in the world. Although officially condemned and heavily enforced, street art has a huge following and in many ways is embraced by the public, for example, Stik's stick figures. Dulwich Outdoor Gallery, in collaboration with Street Art London, is an outdoor \"gallery\" of street art in Dulwich, southeast London, with works based on traditional paintings in Dulwich Picture Gallery.\n\nBristol has a prominent street art scene, due in part to the success of Banksy, with many large and colourful murals dominating areas of the city.\n\nPoland has artists like Sainer and Bezt known for painting huge murals on buildings and walls.\n\nParis, France has an active street art scene which is home to artists such as Space Invader, Jef Aérosol, SP 38 and Zevs. Some connect the origins of street art in France to Lettrism of the 1940s and Situationist slogans painted on the walls of Paris starting in the late 1950s. Nouveau realists of the 1960s, including Jacques de la Villeglé, Yves Klein and Arman interacted with public spaces but, like pop art, kept the traditional studio-gallery relationship. The 1962 street installation \"Rideau de Fer\" (Iron Curtain) by Christo and Jeanne-Claude is cited as an early example of unsanctioned street art. In the 1970s, the site-specific work of Daniel Buren appeared in the Paris subway. Blek le Rat and the Figuration Libre movement became active in the 1980s. The 13 arrondissement is actively promoting street art through the Street Art 13 project. That includes two remarkable frescos by D*Face from London: \"Love will not tear us apart\" and “Turncoat”.\n\nStreet art on the Berlin Wall was continuous during the time Germany was divided, but street art in Berlin continued to thrive even after reunification and is home to street artists such as Thierry Noir Tavar Zawacki a.k.a. ABOVE and SP 38. Post-communism, cheap rents, and ramshackle buildings gave rise to street art in areas such as Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg, Kreuzberg, and Friedrichshain.\n\nThe second biggest city in Estonia, Tartu, has been called the Estonian street art capital. While Tallinn has been against graffiti, then Tartu is known for street art festival Stencibility and for being home for a wide range of works from various artist.\n\nThe street art scene in Greece has been active since the late 1980s but gained momentum in Athens leading up to the country's 2011 financial crisis, with a number of artists raising voices of resistance, creating allegorical works and social commentary in the historic city center and Exarhia district. The \"New York Times\" published a story about the crisis in relation to street art, and art in general.\nStreet art by Bleeps.gr, whose work has been categorized as \"artivism\", can be found in neighborhoods such as Psiri.\n\nIn Spain Madrid and Barcelona represent the most graffiti populated cities, while Valencia, Zaragoza and Málaga also have a street art scene.\nItaly has been very active in street art since the end of the 1990s; some of the most famous street artists include BLU, 108, and Sten Lex.\nStreet art in Amsterdam (Netherlands) centers on the Flevopark, on the east side, NDSM wharf in Amsterdam Noord, and the Red-light District.

The exhibition included work from some of Poland's elite street artists as well as globally known artists. Despite being mostly accepted by the public, with authorities occasionally allowing artists licenses to decorate public places, other properties are still illegally targeted by artists. Warsaw and Gdańsk are other Polish cities with a vibrant street art culture.\n\nA monument in Bulgaria depicting Soviet Army soldiers was targeted by anonymous street artists in June, 2011.

Cheney, between 1930 and 1931. It was commissioned by the National Association of Book Publishers, and later published in 1932. The purpose of the report was to analyze the overall structure of the book publishing industry and to find ways to improve the system as a whole. The report advocated for several revisions to the book publishing industry including standardization of the physical size of books, increasing the number of children reading books in the education system, and constructing more bookstores in more parts of the country in the United States. Cheney also correctly anticipated the increasing demand for more books at the end of the Second World War, and sought to find ways to better distribute them.\n\nThe most important contribution of The Cheney Report to the market of American book publishing, and to American culture as a whole, was his insistence on the implementation of a standardized form of communication within the book publishing world. Cheney was the first person to suggest some kind of machine based coding system for the organization of books. While he did not present a specific plan for this machine based coding system in his report, Cheney’s revolutionary ideas helped spur the creation and implementation, several decades later, of the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) that the United States adopted to categorize books.\n\nOn the 60th anniversary of The Cheney Report in 1992, Publishers Weekly reprinted the report in full and began to revisit some of the ideas the report originally proposed.\n\nWhile the ideas presented in the report later helped establish a system as effective as the ISBN, The Cheney Report was not well received at the time of publication. Cheney claimed to have written the report “in the spirit of objective sympathy”, but the report was mostly met with harsh criticism and considered wildly ineffective by most book industry insiders at the time. Many people felt the ideas he proposed were farfetched, while today the idea of a book coding system, like the ISBN, seems completely logical. One of The Cheney Report supporters did give an alternative reading of The Cheney Report in a 1932 edition of Publishers Weekly:\n\nAlmost none of the ideas presented in the report were taken seriously, and it was not until much later in American history that the machine based coding system was invented and implemented. Cheney did not gain much notoriety from this report and the report has largely gone unnoticed in current American culture. Cheney died in 1939 and never got to see his ideas and concepts implemented.\n"}

A passage at the beginning of the first volume emphasizes the role of Robert Harley, the first earl, in the creation of the library:\nThere can be no Objection against the Prefixing the reasons for Creating the Right Honorable Robert Harley, Esq., a Peer of Great-Britain, and Earl of Oxford; especially, as the valuable Collection, intended to be published in this Form, was made by the Greatness of his Knowledge in all Branches of Learning, and at the vast Expence of that noble Family. ...his Library consisted of more than 100000 different Authors: He, I say, cannot be denied the first Place in this Miscellany, which esteems it an Honour to bear his Name.\n\nEdward Harley, the second earl, who had died only a few years before \"The Harleian Miscellany\" was published, was also a bibliophile who had greatly expanded the library.\n\n"}
{"id": "18364113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18364113", "title": "Theatre criticism", "text": "Theatre criticism\n\nTheatre criticism is a genre of arts criticism, and the act of writing or speaking about the performing arts such as a play or opera.\n\nTheatre criticism is distinct from drama criticism, as the later is a division of literary criticism whereas the former is a critique of the theatrical performance. Dramas or plays as long as they stay in the print form remain a part of literature. They become a part of the performing arts as soon as the written words of the drama are transformed into performance on the stage or any arena suitable for viewers to see. So the literary craft gives birth to a stage production. Likewise a criticism of a written play has a different character from that of a theatre performance. \n\nThere is a distinctive dissimilarity between theatre criticism and a theatre review. Both of them deal with the dramatic arts as they are performed. But they are done in different ways and for different purposes. Both have strong rationalities to support the observations expressed, both are analytical, and both deal with the commendable as well as the blemishes of the production. A theatre review is a short essay for the ordinary uninitiated readers who get to know about the play being performed, about the group staging the play, and its director and other actors. Basically a review is a subjective discourse hinting on the cultural and artistic significance of the production. The storyline is discussed as it is believed to be the mainstay of the production. The discussion reflects an instant reaction of viewing the performance. An overall clinical analysis of each department of the production, like that of acting, stage craft, lighting designs and its implementation, background scoring, dress and costume designing, make-up etc., and even the script that had been prepared for the staging, is made by the reviewer. A review is published during the period when the play is ‘on’, that is, when the play is being regularly staged. This requires a speedy writing of the piece. Thus, a review lacks any deep analytical discourse or investigative studies of the different aspects. It never gives any conclusive verdict about the production, as such. \n\nTheatre criticism, on the other hand, is a deep analytical discourse of the production against the backdrop of the theatre-arts as a whole. The social and political bearings that have relevance to the play are highlighted, so also the cultural import. Hence, the discussion becomes a highly theoretical objective discourse on the historical significance of the production. Criticism thus is an academic dissertation that is usually lengthy and may take a considerable time to write. The piece may be published even after the regular staging of the play has been suspended or stopped, or a subsequent production of a different play has been started by the group. Technicalities of the different aspects of the production are discussed in details together with exhaustive analysis of the rationalities of their execution. Criticism thus is an anatomical scrutiny of the production. The play is not discussed in detail as such, as it is job of the literary critic. Philosophical, political or moral criticism may be considered anti-theatrical. \n\nSome major newspapers cover the arts in some form and theatre criticism may be included as a part of this arts coverage. In the 21st century theatre criticism has grown in online venues, such as e-magazines and blogs, while criticism in newspapers has shrunk. Recent research shows that despite the different medium, online critics may be as trusted as theatre critics who write for newspapers.\n\nSpecialist media exists to cover most artistic disciplines, in this field one such publication is \"The Stage\" (see our for more).\n\n\n\n"}

This rating reason raises a warning to parents and guardians to learn more about a film before they allow their children to view it. \n\nThese thematic elements may include autism, death, disease, discrimination, self-harm, defiance, child abuse, dysfunctional families, driving under the influence, STDs, hate, coming-of-age issues, crime, corruption, verbal abuse, teenage pregnancy, addiction, disability, hazing, infidelity, politics, social issues, abortion, religion, and other serious subjects or mature discussions that some parents and guardians feel may not be appropriate for their young children. \n\nFilms with strong thematic elements include \"The Cider House Rules\", \"Zootopia\", \"Coco\", \"Juno\", \"The Aviator\", \"The Color Purple\", \"In Her Shoes\", \"I Love You Phillip Morris\", \"Finding Dory\", \"My Girl\", \"\", \"Hop\", \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\", \"The Hunger Games\", \"Warrior\", \"A Beautiful Mind\", \"Inside Out\", \"White Oleander\", \"42\",\"Only Yesterday\", \"God's Not Dead\", \"God's Not Dead 2\", \"\", \"The Fault in Our Stars\", \"Isle of Dogs\", \"The Secret Life of Pets 2\" and \"Wonder Park\".

The main character is alone, in a wild island, when he starts to hear this unexpected music.\nIn the plot the song stands for the lightheartedness of the high society, that somehow violates the wild space of a lonely island, were the main character is literally \"struggling for survival\".\n\nOne can argue that Bioy Casares chose this song mainly because it was a strong symbol to represent the society of the 40's.\n\nThe saxophonist Pablo in Herman Hesse's novel \"Steppenwolf\" mentions this song as an example of melodies quietly reproduced every night by dreamy people.\n"}
