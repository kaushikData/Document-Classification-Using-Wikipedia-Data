It is held in the collection of the Abingdon County Hall Museum.\nThe map covers the stretch of river between Abingdon and Radley. It is long and wide, consisting of four pieces of vellum that are glued together.\n\nThe map was preserved in the archives of the Verney family, having been inherited by Mary Blacknall (1616–1650), who married Sir Ralph Verney, 1st Baronet, of Middle Claydon (1613–1696). In 1907, it was given to the Corporation of Abingdon and was framed and held in the Guildhall at Abingdon. The map was restored for a reopening of Abingdon Museum, where it was put on display in 2012. As part of the investigation during this process, the map was x-rayed at the National Gallery in London. \n\nAnother smaller map of the river, known as the Blacknall Map (or Claydon Map), is held at Claydon House, the Verney family home, in Buckinghamshire to the north of Abingdon. This was produced for William Blacknall in support of his mill-owning and fishery rights during a lawsuit in 1570. The Monks' Map itself may well have been produced for a similar purpose rather than by monks at Abingdon Abbey.\n\n"}

{"id": "41812290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41812290", "title": "Annette Lemieux", "text": "Annette Lemieux\n\nAnnette Lemieux (born 1957 in Norfolk, Virginia) is an American artist who emerged in the early 1980s along with the “picture theory” artists (David Salle, Jack Goldstein, Cindy Sherman, Barbara Kruger, Richard Prince). Lemieux brought to the studio a discipline equally based on introspection, and the manifestations of an ideological minimalism. Process is a key component in the execution of her works over the past three decades, creating the lure to the confrontation of issues of social and historical urgency.\nLemieux has been the recipient of awards from the National Endowment of the Arts and the Keiser Wilhelm Museum, Germany and an honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts from Monserrat College of Art. Presently, in addition to her studio and exhibition schedule, she is a senior lecturer at Harvard University in the area of visual and environmental studies.\n\nLemieux is represented by Elizabeth Dee Gallery in New York.\n\nAnnette Rose Lemieux was born in Norfolk, Virginia. Her father Joseph was in the Marines, and the family lived in a house close to the base. When Lemieux's father was called overseas, her mother, Margaret, moved with their two daughters – Annette and Suzette – to her hometown of Torrington, Connecticut. Later on, she received her Bachelor of Fine Arts in painting from Hartford Art School University of Hartford in Connecticut.\n\nIn early works like \"It’s a Wonderful Life\", 1986 [named after the 1946 Frank Capra film], Lemieux incorporated multiple forms of popular media to create a narrative in the form of self-doubt, personal vulnerability, along with an awareness of the absurdist political/religious/economic histories we accumulate as a civilization in a never-ending current. Following the legacies of Robert Rauschenberg and John Cage, she works to narrow the gap between “art” and “life”. Lemieux's works resist the traps of a “signature style,” and she has referred to her shows looking more like group shows rather than a single artist's. Her work surprises us, challenges her audience to keep up, and resists the conformity of the brand. As stated by Peggy Phelan, “For Lemieux, the art object offers her thoughts and feelings a way to travel . . . Art is her way of responding, both publicly and intimately, to the ongoing predicament of our lives”.\n\nLemieux works from a repertoire of real objects and images from films and books featuring reproductions of historical photographs from the forties and fifties, which she calls her “landscape.” Her practice reflects a deep commitment to content and well as process, incorporating intellectual analyses of social codes with an emphasis on psychological and emotional content. Fundamentally interdisciplinary in content and form, Lemieux’s work is a continual exploration and explication of our cultural constructs and how objects that reflect the self define the self within the culture. In her review of Lemieux's major retrospective \"The Strange Life of Objects,\" Elizabeth Michelman explains that, \"[In] addressing her content-laden material systematically, not sentimentally, Lemieux places objects and images in predicaments that are highly structured and memorable. In both two- and three-dimensional formats, she appropriates and wittily recontextualizes furnishings, texts and photographs rescued from history, popular culture and personal records.\"\n\nIn her recent show entitled \"Unfinished Business\" at the Carpenter Center, Harvard University, Lemieux explored the territory between object, mediated memory, personal experience and cultural history that has informed her practice for three decades. Lemieux’s objects and imagery derive directly from the world as it exists, not from the recesses of a private imagination that must search itself to produce the substance of invented images.\nWith representative examples of her work in over 50 public collections, Lemieux has been the focus of two recent exhibitions organized by the Krannert Art Museum and Harvard University.\n\nLemieux's work can be found in the permanent collections of numerous art museums, including Museum of Modern Art, New York; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Whitney Museum of American Art; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Hirshhorn Museum, Washington; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven; Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University; Worcester Art Museum, Worcester MA; Museum of Fine Arts Boston; The Art Institute Chicago, as well as many other museums throughout the world. Additionally, she has received awards and grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Kaiser Wilhelm Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, as well as other institutions. In 2009, received an honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts from Montserrat College of Art as well.\n\n\n\n"}

Later she has an appointment with the school therapist Vincent (Tom Malloy) who sees the burn and questions how it happened but she refuses to talk. During class she begins to fantasize about kissing the Red Headed Girl (Mallory Moye) who is sitting in the front row. After class, the girl approaches Ashley asking why she is always looking at her during class and calls her weird. As she is leaving, a boy named Steve approaches her, but she ignores him and leaves.\n\nAt home, Ashley has a fight with her mother Stacy Collins (Jennifer Taylor) because Vincent had called her and requested she take Ashley to group therapy at the hospital. Ashley attends the group therapy sessions, but refuses to participate in the discussion. Things become worse when one member becomes aggressive and is dragged away by hospital attendants. Ashley returns to the park to smoke where she meets Vickey (Danielle Morrow), who asks for a smoke. Asking if her lighter is real gold, Vickey suggests that she should try to scratch it like in the movies. Ashley hands Vickey her switchblade. Impressed, Vickey invites Ashley to her house. Vickey tells Ashley she can contact her under the username \"SapphoGirl13\" on her computer. Vickey and Ashley begin kissing when Vickey notices cuts along Ashley’s wrists. Ashley becomes turned on when Vickey touches her wrists, but Vickey becomes disturbed when Ashley wants to use the switchblade and asks her to leave. At home, Ashley contacts Vickey on her computer using the alias \"HomeStarch99\" and they begin to have cybersex however Ashley quickly becomes uninterested, turns off the computer and cuts herself instead.\n\nWith the group therapy not working, Vincent informs Ashley and Stacy that a social worker will visit them. Stacy threatens to confiscate Ashley’s computer, but eventually lets her keep it after she begs her not to take it. The next day at the park, Ashley meets Randall (Luke Eberl) and the Red Headed Girl from her class in a car drinking. They invite Ashley to join them and the girl begins to give Ashley alcohol using mouth to mouth and then offers to reward her with a kiss every time she takes a drink. Initially starting off well, the girl becomes angry when Ashley scratches her nails hard onto her back and they ask her to get out of the car. Ashley is waiting at a bus stop to return home when she meets Chico (Brennan Murray) after talking to her. She does not reply so he decides to try holding her hand and she does not resist. Arriving home, she meets Stacy’s new boyfriend Bill (Michael Madsen) and instantly does not like him. After an awkward meal, she retreats to her room and proceeds to play loud music to distract her from the sexual sounds coming from her mother’s room. She goes on her computer and begins to chat with \"Candid33,\" a 33-year-old woman called Candice (Nicole Buehrer). They exchange phone numbers and talk about their hobbies.\n\nThe social worker arrives to meet Ashley and Stacy, however, Stacy becomes angry when she feels that she thinks Stacy is a bad mother. Ashley leaves for school and meets Chico again at the bus stop. He once again tries to hold hands, but this time she refuses. When he asks why, she tells him she likes girls. Chico becomes angry and leaves. At school, Ashley goes to her appointment with Vincent who decides to try a new approach, but Ashley is reminded of her dad who had died years before and she begins to cry. Ashley reveals her dad Michael Collins (Bill Lippincott) hurt her, but before going into detail, the session ends and she gets up and leaves for class. After class, she again meets Steve who asks her out, but is rejected. Ashley is at home watching TV when Stacy and Bill come home from the market, but Stacy has to go back because she forgot her debit card. Alone in the house with Ashley, Bill sits next to her and tries to initiate a conversation. Continually ignored, Bill forces a kiss on Ashley just as Stacy returns home. Stacy kicks Bill out of the house and questions Ashley on what was happening. But when Ashley won't talk, Stacy slaps her and sends her to her room. Ashley sits on her bed, takes out her switchblade and cuts her wrists. As she watches the blood coming from her wrists, she decides to call Candice and they proceed to have phone sex.\n\nAt school, Carly (Deanna Moore), Sammy (Anne Elisabeth) and Summer (Reid Cox) invite Ashley to join them skipping class. However, when they are outside the school, the three girls all attack Ashley because she is a lesbian. The social worker returns, this time speaking to Stacy in private. Still initially unwilling to answer and questions, she eventually breaks down crying and reveals that Ashley’s dad Michael sexually abused Ashley when she was a child.\n\nAfter school, Steve once again approaches Ashley who again ignores him and enters the women’s bathroom. Angry at constantly being rejected, Steve follows her into the bathroom and forces a kiss on her, however she retaliates by biting his lip. Enraged, he throws her to the ground and begins to force himself on her when she slashes his chest with the switchblade and runs away. Ashley goes to meet Candice at her house. Ashley is initially very shy, so Candice decides that to break the awkward silence, they should get dressed up and go out for dinner. Their date is a success and Candice even manages to get Ashley to smile, something she almost never does. Returning to Candice's house, they meet her roommate Clair (Sarah Schreiber) and photographer Laura (Ilea Matthews). After introducing themselves to each other, Laura asks Ashley if she could take some pictures of her. Ashley is having fun until they notice the scars on her wrists and she once again becomes silent. However, she gets her confidence back when Laura reveals she also used to cut her wrists. That night, Ashley and Candice spend the night together.\n\nIn the morning, Candice points out that Ashley should leave or she will be late for her train. Ashley becomes disheartened however Candice quickly reassures her that she does want to continue their relationship together. When Ashley arrives home, she finds Stacy waiting up for her and worrying where she had been, After talking together, they are finally able to reconcile their relationship. Back at school, Ashley has her appointment with Vincent as usual and he is surprised to see her happy and smiling for the first time. On the way home, she meets Chico again and they decide to be friends again. That night, Ashley goes to her room and merrily calls Candice.\n\nThe film was listed in 2014 by Autostraddle as one of \"8 Pretty Great Lesbian Movies You Haven’t Seen Yet.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2907134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2907134", "title": "Barbara Kopple", "text": "Barbara Kopple\n\nBarbara Kopple (born July 30, 1946) is an American film director known primarily for her documentary work.\n\nShe has won two Academy Awards, the first in 1976 for \"Harlan County, USA\", about a Kentucky miners' strike, and the second in 1991 for \"American Dream\"\",\" the story of the Hormel Foods strike in Austin, Minnesota in 1985-86. \n\nKopple also directed \"A Conversation With Gregory Peck\" and \"Bearing Witness\", as well as documentaries on Mike Tyson and Woody Allen. The latter film, \"Wild Man Blues\", focuses on his Dixieland jazz tour and on Allen's relationship with Soon-Yi Previn. She has directed episodes of the television drama series \"\" and \"Oz\", winning a Directors Guild of America award for the former.    \n\nKopple grew up on a vegetable farm in Scarsdale, New York, the daughter of a textile executive. She studied psychology at Northeastern University, where she opted to make her first film instead of writing a term paper for a clinical psychology course. This experience began Kopple's interest in filmmaking. Kopple's political involvement started in college with her participation in antiwar protests against the Vietnam War.\n\nKopple attended the School of Visual Arts soon thereafter, where Kopple met documentary filmmakers Albert and David Maysles through a classmate. She would assist them on their documentary \"Salesman\", before doing camera work for their film on the Rolling Stones, \"Gimme Shelter\". Reflecting on her time working with the Maysles, Kopple said “the wonderful thing about working for Alan and David Maysles was that they were the first company that treated women as equals...everybody attended all the meetings; everybody's opinion was important.” She subsequently worked as an editor, camera operator, and sound operator on numerous documentaries before starting production on \"Harlan County, USA\" in 1972. \n\nKopple first became aware of the plights of the Appalachia miners while studying at Northeastern University. In 1972, Kopple started up her own production company, Cabin Creek Films. It was during this time that miners walked off the job in Harlan County, and Kopple began the filming Miners for Democracy movement led by Arnold Miller. When Tony Boyle was ousted from the union leadership and miners began striking for union recognition, Kopple moved to Harlan with a crew of five and a loan of $12,000. Kopple and her crew lived with the miners, filming even when they ran out of film because the presence of a camera “kept down violence.”\n\nThe film took four years to make and costed over $200,000. Continuing production was financially demanding on Kopple and her small crew, who regularly moved back-and-forth between Harlan and New York to collect financial backing from grant proposals and odd jobs, even writing letters for money from miners’ homes. When she ran out of money, Kopple would “come back to New York and take whatever job I could, editing, sound, until I got enough to go back.” Kopple also accepted donated money from her parents, friends and others in order to continue financing the project; she eventually placed herself into great debt for the film, utilizing her personal credit card for many expenses.\n\nKopple was threatened by mine owners during filming, being told that “if I was ever caught alone at night I'd be killed.” She reportedly carried two pistols while filming in Harlan.\n\n\"Harlan County, USA\" debuted at the New York Film Festival in October, 1976, where it received a standing ovation. The film would go on to win the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, Kopple accepting the award “on behalf of the miners of Harlan County who took us into their homes, trusted us, and shared their love with us.” \n\nAfter \"Harlan County, USA\", Kopple wouldn't officially finish another documentary until 1990. Kopple instead would take her political focus on unions to television, directing the 90-minute television drama \"Keeping On\".\n\nKopple's next feature-length documentary would capture the rise and fall of a two-year-long workers strike against Hormel Foods. Kopple was first turned onto the subject matter in the early 1980s while working on starting a different documentary project. While driving in Worthington, Minn., Kopple heard a new radio broadcast on developing strikes amongst workers in meatpacking plants of Austin. Kopple reportedly started driving towards Austin immediately; “that was the beginning,” said Kopple, “And I never left.\" \n\n\"American Dream\" proved to be even more difficult for Kopple to produce than \"Harlan County, USA,\" despite her previous documentary's success. Budget for the film was tight, and Kopple found it difficult to obtain funding due to its subject matter.\n\nUnlike \"Harlan County\", which had Kopple very much on one side of the battle, Kopple intentionally aimed to be much more objective in depicting the differing perspectives of the Hormel Strike in \"American Dream\". “I cared about the people in Austin, Minn., very much,” Kopple reflected, “but if we were ever to look back at [the film], we had to have the full story.”\n\n\"American Dream\" premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 6, 1990. It would eventually earn Kopple her second Academy Award the following year. Kopple continued to exclusively make documentaries for nearly the next decade and a half, exploring new subject matters such as crime procedurals and the lives of celebrities. \n\nHer first non-documentary feature film to play in theaters, \"Havoc\", starred Anne Hathaway and Bijou Phillips as wealthy suburbanites who venture into East Los Angeles Latino gang territory, and was released straight to DVD in 2005. Kopple has recently ventured into advertising work that includes documentary-style commercials for Target Stores. \n\nShe was also among the 19 filmmakers who worked together anonymously (under the rubric Winterfilm Collective) to produce the film \"Winter Soldier\", an anti-war documentary about the Winter Soldier Investigation. She has also done films for The Working Group, directing the 30-minute short documentary \"Locked Out in America: Voices From Ravenswood\" for the \"We Do the Work\" series. (\"We Do the Work\" aired in the mid-1990s on the PBS television series \"P.O.V.\", and Kopple's segment was based on the book \"\".)\n\nIn the fall of 2006, she released a documentary, \"\", about the Dixie Chicks' George W. Bush-related controversy.\n\nIn 2012 Kopple released two films. One is about Mariel Hemingway, the granddaughter of Ernest Hemingway, and the other is concerning the 150th Anniversary of \"The Nation\" magazine. The film on Hemingway, \"Running from Crazy\", was shown at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival and on the Oprah Winfrey Network.\n\nIn 2014 the UK's \"Sight and Sound\" magazine published a \"Greatest Documentaries of All Time\" list, in which Kopple's film \"Harlan County, USA\" (1976) was ranked 24th, tied with two other movies.\n\nWhen beginning to make the film \"Harlan County, USA\" Kopple was promised a $9,000 grant then was later denied. This happened countless times before she eventually secured the necessary funds. The moving image collection of Barbara Kopple is held at the Academy Film Archive, which preserved \"Harlan County, USA\".    \n\nKopple's documentaries are in the style of cinema vérité. Reflecting on her documentaries in 1991, Kopple said “...the kind of films that influenced me have more to do with watching people, letting scenes come alive so you actually see people change through the course of the film...almost like you're right there.” Her work typically consist of observational footage, minimal voice-overs and intimate interviews with her subjects. She has listed the Maysle brothers and D.A. Pennebacker as notable influences on her technique. “I absolutely loved [\"Don't Look Back\"] because he got so close to Dylan,” Kopple said of Pennebacker, “I wanted to make films that were as intimate as that.”\n\nKopple's work is often politically-driven. She has made several films on U.S. labor issues, as well as worker's unions, and has been a longtime advocate for the American labor movement. Many of her documentaries revolve around political subject matters, but her more recent work has taken a shift towards music documentary and celebrity portraiture.\n\nFor her documentaries Kopple works in small crews of 2 to 5, almost always acting as her own sound operator. \n\nKopple is a niece of the American playwright Murray Burnett.\n\n\n•  1977: Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, \"Harlan County, USA\"\n\n•  1990: CINE Golden Eagle for Documentary, American Dream \n\n•  1991: Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, \"American Dream\"\n\n•  1991: Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, \"American Dream\"\n\n•  1992: DGA Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Documentary/Actuality, \"American Dream\" \n\n•  1993: Nominee for Primetime Emmy in Outstanding Individual Achievement – Informational Programming, \"Fallen Champ: The Untold Story of Mike Tyson\"\n\n•  1993: Woman in Film Crystal Awards, Dorothy Arzner Directors Award \n\n•  1994: American Film Institute, USA, Maya Deren Independent Film and Video Artists Award\n\n•  1994: CINE Golden Eagle for Documentary, \"A Century of Women\"\n\n•  1994: DGA Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Documentary/Actuality, \"Fallen Champ: The Untold Story of Mike Tyson\"\n\n•  1995: Nominee for Primetime Emmy in Outstanding Informational Series, \"A Century of Woman\"\n\n•  1998: DGA Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Dramatic Series’, \"Homicide: Life on the Street\" \n\n•  1998: Human Rights Watch International Film Festival, Lifetime Achievement Award \n\n•  2005: CINE Golden Eagle for Documentary, \"Bearing Witness\" \n\n•  2006: Nominee for EDA Award for Best Documentary by or About Women, \"Shut Up & Sing\"\n\n•  2006: Audience Award for Audience Favorite Documentary, \"Shut Up & Sing\"\n\n•  2006: Woman Film Critics Circle Awards, Lifetime Achievement Award \n\n•  2006: Special Jury Prize for DocuFest Competition, \"Shut Up & Sing\"\n\n•  2010: Nominated for Emmy in Outstanding Arts & Culture Documentary, \"Woodstock: Now & Then\"\n\n•  2011: Felix Award for Best Documentary, American Dream \n\n•  2011: Grand Festival Award for Documentary, \"Bagels, Borscht, and Brotherhood – Allen Ginsberg \" \n\n•  2014: Nominee for Primetime Emmy in Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction, \"Running from Crazy\" \n\n•  2017: Nominated for Emmy in Outstanding Arts & Culture Documentary, \"Miss Sharon Jones!\"\n\n•  2018: Athena Film Festival, Laura Ziskin Lifetime Achievement Award \n\n\n"}
{"id": "79504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=79504", "title": "Bard", "text": "Bard\n\nIn medieval Gaelic and British culture, a bard was a professional story teller, verse-maker and music composer, employed by a patron (such as a monarch or noble), to commemorate one or more of the patron's ancestors and to praise the patron's own activities.\n\nOriginally a specific, lower class of poet, contrasting with the higher rank known as \"fili\" in Ireland and Highland Scotland, with the decline of living bardic tradition in the modern period the term \"bard\" acquired generic meanings of an author or minstrel, especially a famous one. For example, William Shakespeare, and Rabindranath Tagore, are known as \"the Bard of Avon\" and \"the Bard of Bengal\" respectively.\n\nThe word is a Celtic loan word from Scottish Gaelic \"bàrd\", Irish \"bard\", Welsh \"bardd\". In 16th-century Scotland, it was a derogatory term for an itinerant musician; nonetheless it was later romanticised by Sir Walter Scott.\n\nIn medieval Gaelic and Welsh society, a \"bard\" (Scottish and Irish Gaelic) or \"bardd\" (Welsh) was a professional poet, employed to compose eulogies for his lord (see planxty). If the employer failed to pay the proper amount, the bard would then compose a satire (c.f. \"fili\", \"fáith\"). In other Indo-European societies, the same function was fulfilled by skalds, rhapsodes, minstrels and \"scops\", among others. A hereditary caste of professional poets in Proto-Indo-European society has been reconstructed by comparison of the position of poets in medieval Ireland and in ancient India in particular.\n\nBards (who are not the same as the Irish 'filidh' or 'fili') were those who sang the songs recalling the tribal warriors' deeds of bravery as well as the genealogies and family histories of the ruling strata among Celtic societies. The pre-Christian Celtic peoples recorded no written histories; however, Celtic peoples did maintain an intricate oral history committed to memory and transmitted by bards and filid. Bards facilitated the memorisation of such materials by the use of metre, rhyme and other formulaic poetic devices.\n\nOne of the most notable bards in Irish Mythological was Amergin Glúingel, he was bard, druid and judge for the Milesians.\n\nIn medieval Ireland, bards were one of two distinct groups of poets, the other being the \"fili\". According to the Early Irish law text on status, \"Uraicecht Becc\", bards were a lesser class of poets, not eligible for higher poetic roles as described above. However, it has also been argued that the distinction between \"filid\" (pl. of \"fili\") and bards was a creation of Christian Ireland, and that the \"filid\" were more associated with the church. By the Early Modern Period, these names came to be used interchangeably.\n\nIrish bards formed a professional hereditary caste of highly trained, learned poets. The bards were steeped in the history and traditions of clan and country, as well as in the technical requirements of a verse technique that was syllabic and used assonance, half rhyme and alliteration, among other conventions. As officials of the court of king or chieftain, they performed a number of official roles. They were chroniclers and satirists whose job it was to praise their employers and damn those who crossed them. It was believed that a well-aimed bardic satire, \"glam dicenn\", could raise boils on the face of its target.\n\nThe bardic system lasted until the mid-17th century in Ireland and the early 18th century in Scotland. In Ireland, their fortunes had always been linked to the Gaelic aristocracy, which declined along with them during the Tudor Reconquest.\n\nThe early history of the bards can be known only indirectly through mythological stories. The first mention of the bardic profession in Ireland is found in the Book of Invasions, in a story about the Irish colony of Tuatha De Danann (Peoples of Goddess Danu), also called Danonians. They became the \"aos sí\" (folk of the mound), comparable to Norse \"alfr\" and British fairy. During the tenth year of the reign of the last Belgic monarch, the people of the colony of Tuatha De Danann, as the Irish called it, invaded and settled in Ireland. They were divided into three tribes—the tribe of Tuatha who were the nobility, the tribe of De who were the priests (those devoted to serving God or De) and the tribe of Danann, who were the bards. This account of the Tuatha De Danann must be considered legendary; however the story was an integral part of the oral history of Irish bards themselves.\n\nThe best-known group of bards in Scotland were the members of the MacMhuirich family, who flourished from the 15th to the 18th centuries. The family was centred in the Hebrides, and claimed descent from a 13th-century Irish bard who, according to legend, was exiled to Scotland. The family was at first chiefly employed by the Lords of the Isles as poets, lawyers, and physicians. With the fall of the Lordship of the Isles in the 15th century, the family was chiefly employed by the chiefs of the MacDonalds of Clanranald. Members of the family were also recorded as musicians in the early 16th century, and as clergymen possibly as early as the early 15th century. The last of the family to practise classical Gaelic poetry was Domhnall MacMhuirich, who lived on South Uist in the 18th century.\n\nA number of bards in Welsh mythology have been preserved in medieval Welsh literature such as the Red Book of Hergest, the White Book of Rhydderch, the Book of Aneirin and the Book of Taliesin. The bards Aneirin and Taliesin may be legendary reflections of historical bards active in the 6th and 7th centuries.\nVery little historical information about Dark Age Welsh court tradition survives, but the Middle Welsh material came to be the nucleus of the Matter of Britain and Arthurian legend as they developed from the 13th century. The (Welsh) Laws of Hywel Dda, originally compiled around 900 A.D, identify a bard as a member of a king's household. His duties, when the bodyguard were sharing out booty, included the singing of the sovereignty of Britain—possibly why the genealogies of the British high kings survived into the written historical record.\n\nThe royal form of bardic tradition ceased in the 13th century, when the 1282 Edwardian conquest permanently ended the rule of the Welsh princes. The legendary suicide of \"The Last Bard\" (c. 1283), was commemorated in the poem \"The Bards of Wales\" by the Hungarian poet János Arany in 1857, as a way of encoded resistance to the suppressive politics of his own time. However, the poetic and musical traditions were continued throughout the Middle Ages, e.g., by noted 14th-century poets Dafydd ap Gwilym and Iolo Goch. The tradition of regularly assembling bards at an eisteddfod never lapsed, and was strengthened by formation of the Gorsedd by Iolo Morganwg in 1792, establishing Wales as the major Celtic upholder of bardic tradition in the 21st century. Many regular \"eisteddfodau\" are held in Wales, including the National Eisteddfod of Wales which was instituted in 1861 and has been held annually since 1880. Many Welsh schools conduct their own annual versions at which bardic traditions are emulated.\n\nThe musical and poetic traditions of the Welsh bards are perpetuated by the Gorsedd of bards and through the National Eisteddfod of Wales (\"Eisteddfod Genedlaethol Cymru\").\n\nFrom its frequent use in Romanticism, 'The Bard' became attached as a title to various poets,\n\nFrom its Romanticist usage, the notion of the bard as a minstrel with qualities of a priest, magician or seer also entered the fantasy genre in the 1960s to 1980s, for example as the 'Bard' class (Dungeons & Dragons),\"Bard\" class (Pathfinder RPG - Paizo), \"Bard\" by Keith Taylor (1981), \"\" by Morgan Llywelyn (1984), and in video games in fantasy settings such as \"The Bard's Tale\" (1985).\n\n\n"}

The fountain was originally made for the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and is now located at the corner of Independence Avenue and First Street, SW, in the United States Botanic Garden, on the grounds of the United States Capitol, in Washington D.C..\n\nThe Fountain of Light and Water, commonly called the Bartholdi fountain, was created for the 1876 Philadelphia Exposition which celebrated the 100th birthday of the United States. It was designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, and it was cast by the Durenne foundry in France, which had won awards for its cast-iron fountains at earlier international expositions in 1862, 1867 and 1873. Bartholdi offered the fountain to the Exposition for free; he intended to sell it afterwards, and to sell others of the same design to other cities. The fountains stood at the center of the esplanade, near the main entrance to the exposition.\n\nWhen the exposition ended in 1877, Bartholdi did not find any buyers for his fountain. One year later it was purchased by the United States Congress, which offered him only six thousand dollars, half the sum he had originally asked. In 1878, it was placed at the base of Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. In 1926 it was removed and stored to facilitate completion of the George Gordon Meade Memorial, and for landscaping improvements around the Grant Memorial. In 1932, the sculpture was placed at its current location in the United States Botanic Garden, on the grounds of the United States Capitol, \n\nIn 2008 the Architect of the Capitol began a complete restoration of the fountain and its basin, the first complete deconstruction and restoration since 1927. The restoration repaired deterioration to the metals inside and out, and also provided modern pumps and motors, a new water treatment and filtration system, and a zinc coating to preserve the original cast-iron of the fountain. The fountain was returned to Bartholdi Park in spring 2011.\n\nThe fountain is composed of a series of basins, supported by sculptures of classical figures. The cast iron is coated with bronze, stands thirty feet high, and weighs thirty thousand pounds. It stands in the center of a large circular marble pool. \n\nThree figures of women, standing on a triangle pedestal with an ornamental design of seas shells and three reptiles spouting water, support the lower cast iron vasque, which is adorned with a circle of twelve lamps. In the center, three kneeling tritons support another, smaller and higher vasque. Water spouts from a crown at the top, cascades down into the smaller vasque, and then down into the larger vasque before spilling into the main basin. The cascade of water was illuminated by the gas lamps (later replaced with electric globes), making it one of the first monuments in Washington, D.C. to be lit at night, and therefore a popular evening destination in the 1880s.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19378082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19378082", "title": "Bibliotheca universalis", "text": "Bibliotheca universalis\n\nBibliotheca universalis (1545–49) was the first truly comprehensive \"universal\" listing of all the books of the first century of printing. It was an alphabetical bibliography that listed all the known books printed in Latin, Greek, or Hebrew.\n\nThe Swiss scholar Conrad Gessner started to compile his extensive work on \"Bibliotheca universalis\" at the age of 25. He first visited as many of the Italian and German libraries as he could find. His motivation was partly a fear of the loss of precious manuscripts, such as the destruction of the library at Buda, by the Turks in 1526. He described the project in its title, as involving works \"extant and not, ancient and more recent down to the present day, learned and not, published and hiding in libraries\". He published the completed work in 1545 in Zurich, after some four years of research. At the time, he wrote \"In truth I rejoice and thank God because I have finally gotten out of the labyrinth in which I was trapped for almost three years\". It included his own bio-bibliography. \"Bibliotheca universalis\" was the first modern bibliography of importance published since the invention of printing, and through it, Gessner became known as the \"father of bibliography.\"\n\nThe work attempted to be an exhaustive survey of known writing in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and included approximately three thousand authors The authors’ forenames were listed alphabetically according to mediaeval usage, with a reverse index of their surnames. It was intended as an index by subject of all known authors. Gessner listed the writers together with the titles of their works, short biographies, and publication details including place of printing, printers and editors. He added his own annotations, comments, and evaluations of the nature and merit of every entry. It included about twelve thousand titles.\n\nGessner followed Johannes Trithemius’s work of placing works in systems of cataloging. Gessner admired Trithemius’s systems and used them as guidelines and templates; however Gessner carried the idea of cataloging and systems a step further. Theodore Besterman, in \"The Beginnings of Systematic Bibliography\", suggests that Gessner’s work to organize knowledge was the forerunner of Francis Bacon’s works and other encyclopedias that followed. Though called \"universal\", it was intended to be selective.\n\nIn 1548, Gessner followed this with a companion thematic index to \"Bibliotheca universalis\", a large folio, \"Pandectarum sive Partitionum universalium Conradi Gesneri Tigurini, medici & philosophiae professoris, libri xxi\" (\"Pandectae\").\n\nThe \"Pandectae\" had nineteen sections, each devoted to a scholarly discipline and contained dedications to the best scholar printers of Gessner's time. He listed their publications and accomplishments. The planned scope of 21 books was never completed, since part 20 \"De re medica\". was never published, and part 21 \"De theologia Christiana\" was published separately as \"Partitiones theologicae\" in 1549. A further supplement \"Appendix bibliothecae\" containing additions previously published separately by Lycosthenes (1551) and Simmler (1555) appeared in 1555.\n\nGessner made full use of any publishers' catalogues and booksellers' lists which were available in the 16th century that were printed when he was doing his research. These included use of printed catalogues supplied by firms like Aldus Manutius of Venice and Henri Estienne of Paris.\n\nGessner's work, with its heterodox principles and advanced Protestant scholarship was a direct challenge to the authority of the Catholic Church which soon banned the work in the Index librorum prohibitorum. The Counter Reformation's response took another generation of Catholic scholarship to produce and appeared on the Vatican press in Rome in 1593 under the programmatic title, \"Bibliotheca selecta\". This updated \"Anti-Gessner\" was assembled in 18 books covering the bibliography of the traditional scientific disciplines (Theology, 1-11, Law, 12, Philosophy, 13, Medicine, 14) and the liberal arts, 15-18, by the Mantuan Jesuit humanist and bibliographer Antonio Possevino.\n\n"}

CREW operates on the border between art and science, between performance art and new technology. Artist Eric Joris develops his live-art projects in close collaboration with scientists and other artists\n\nCREW's shows range from one-to-one performances, staged performances and visual arts installations to scientific research set-ups and interventions in public spaces. CREW's work has been presented on stages across Europe, at large public events from Brussels to the Shanghai World Expo, and at scientific conferences in Europe, China and the U.S. In 13 years CREW has immersed thousands of people.\n\nCREW is artistic partner in the EU-funded multidisciplinary research consortium Dreamspace, which develops tools that enable creative professionals to combine live performances, video and computer generated imagery in real time.\n\nCREW creates immersion-based performance and was the first to combine 360° Omni Directional Video (ODV) and Head-mounted display (HMD) for delivering an 'Alternative Reality' ('AltR'). Unlike sitting and standing Virtual Reality applications, CREW's work delivers 'AltR' which is anchored in the physical: by moving, walking and running the 'immersant' experiences the virtual world from within his own body. This resulted in the 2004 \"Crash\", a performance piece in which embodiment was a key element. A playful use of real time versus prerecorded material typified the work of this period and turned the 'immersants' into real protagonists. 'Headswap' sessions allowed integration of out-of-body phenomena into performances like \"Double U\" (2008).\n\"Terra Nova\" gave fifty-five people an immersive experience in the course of a ninety-minute show.\n\nIn 2000 CREW built a performance Cave automatic virtual environment large enough to include actors, artists, technicians and an audience of fifty. CREW's inspiration came from a theatre technician, Paul Antipoff, who was paralysed from the neck down and survived through a symbiosis with technology. The University of Hasselt developed a PC-driven CAVE, with a 3D real-time painting tool, and a robotic leg. Antipoff was able to 'handle' his computer, electric wheelchair and robotic leg with tools attached to his head and mouth. Immersed with the audience in the CAVE, Antipoff started to paint and to interact with a live virtual actor and with the audience.\n\nIn 2002 Eric Joris and Kurt Vanhoutte (University of Antwerp) wanted to create a medium ‘like a prosthesis’ based upon Joris' work with the paraplegic actor. Eric Joris sought to combine 360° Omni Directional Video (ODV) with a Head-mounted display (HMD) and a tracking system instead of using computer graphics or ‘virtual reality’ tools (as in Computer Caves). EDM/University of Hasselt developed not only the camera but the whole system and software around. Their collaboration resulted in immersive performance like \"Crash\",\"U\", \"EUX\" and \"Terra Nova\". Their system proved to be ahead of its time and led to many new applications. Ever since Omni Directional Video (360°) grew popular and the University of Hasselt made a first spin-off, centering on a 16head camerasystem for sports events.\n\nBecause the live performances were technically, financially and logistically very demanding CREW and EDM/University of Hasselt developed a new configuration: C.a.p.e. / Computer Assisted Personal Environment. It is a lightweight version consisting of a backpack with a PC, a Head-mounted display using prerecorded material for 15 minute walks or experiences of fictional, documentary and musical nature. Premièred at the Shanghai World Expo in 2010, this participatory format offers a radically new way to engage with a narrative. C.a.p.e. comes in many versions: \"C.a.p.e. Brussels\", \"C.a.p.e. Tohoku\", \"C.a.p.e. KIT\", \"C.a.p.e. Horror\", \"C.a.p.e. Vooruit\" and \"C.a.p.e. Anima\".\n\nA new version of fully navigable 'AltR' (Alternative Reality), making use of lightfield capture is being investigated by CREW and University of Hasselt/iMinds with the FP7 ICT Dreamspace consortium.\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n"}

It is near the Hungarian-Slovenian border, in the Vendvidék region. Its patron saint Stephen Harding was an English saint and the founder of the Cistercian Order.\n\nBecause this area is traditionally ethnically Slovenian, in the past mass was offered only in Prekmurje Slovenian. Today mass is offered in Hungarian and in the local Prekmurje Slovenian dialect.\n\nThe church was built in 1785. The bishop of Vas, János Szily, aided in the construction and also supported building a school in the village. The first priest was János Marits.

In Alsószölnök where German, Slovenian and Hungarian people lived, the believers went to Sankt Martin an der Raab in Austria (a church was also built in Alsószölnök built in 1816).\nBishop Szily supported masses being offered in the local language (Croatian, the Prekmurje dialect, or German), and therefore he appointed Marits.\n\nIn 2005 Jožef Smej, the bishop of Maribor, and few Hungarian and Slovenian priests blessed a memorial tablet in the church listing the names of Apátistvánfalvian priests and chaplains.\n\nThe walls of the church are thick and it can hold 2,000 people. The baroque murals were created by an unknown painter. The High Altar shows the Legend of St. Stephen Harding. The Trinity is depicted above the mural.\n\nThere is an organ in the choir. The organ was made in 1894 and restored in 2007. Prior to the restoration a small organ was used.

{"id": "11742509", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11742509", "title": "Conservation and restoration of textiles", "text": "Conservation and restoration of textiles\n\nThe conservation and restoration of textiles refers to the processes by which textiles are cared for and maintained to be preserved from future damage. The field falls under the category of art conservation as well as library preservation, depending on the type of collection. In this case, the concept of textile preservation applies to a wide range of artifacts, including tapestries, carpets, quilts, clothing, flags and curtains, as well as objects which ‘’contain’’ textiles, such as upholstered furniture, dolls, and accessories such as fans, parasols, gloves and hats or bonnets. Many of these artifacts require specialized care, often by a professional conservator. The goal of this article is to provide a general overview of the textile preservation process, and to serve as a jumping-off point for further research into more specialized care. Always contact a professional conservator if you are unsure of how to proceed in the preservation process.\n\nHistoric textile collections can largely be divided into three categories: museums, historic societies/locations, and private collections. The needs of each of these locations will vary. A private collection, for instance, is less likely to have as high a traffic flow as a museum, and may thus be able to take preservation steps that a working museum cannot (such as keeping lights to a minimum for longer periods of time). The different venues may also have different problems that arise, such as the fact that many historic homes do not have climate control, and rely strongly on natural light to display their furnishings, both of which may contribute to textile decay.\n\nThe chief cause for decay in textiles is almost always the environment in which they are stored. Light, temperature, and humidity can all contribute to a textile’s health or deterioration, depending on their intensity. Additionally, pests, chemicals, and pollutants may also cause damage to an antique fabric. Airborne chemicals, such as smog or cigarette smoke are also harmful to the textiles, and should be avoided if at all possible: high-efficiency air filters should be installed throughout the building to reduce the presence of airborne chemicals that may stain, discolor, or weaken fabrics.\n\nLight can have a variety of effects on textiles over time. In some cases, it may contribute to fading or discoloration, but of more concern is the damage which the fibers may suffer under prolonged exposure to non-visible light, such as ultraviolet and infrared lighting. Ideally, textiles should be stored or displayed in as little light as possible, and preferably in total darkness. However, as this is impractical for display and care of the piece, knowing the limits of lighting as well as the safest amounts of lighting, become important.\n\nNatural light is the most common source of ultraviolet light, and as such, care should be taken to avoid exposure to direct sunlight at all costs, and indirect sunlight whenever possible. This may mean storing or displaying textiles in an area without windows, or with blackout curtains, which can be pulled whenever the room is not in use. If a room relies on natural light, UV screens or coatings can be applied to the windows to block harmful rays while still allowing light to pass through. These filters should be checked periodically, however, as they have a limited lifespan and may need to be replaced every few years.\n\nFluorescent and halogen-produced light can also produce large amounts of UV radiation, though filters which fit over the bulbs are available to limit the damaging light. These filters will need to be replaced when the bulbs are changed, so maintenance staff should be aware of them and their use.\n\nOne advantage of fluorescent lights is that they produce little heat, which may also be harmful to textiles. Incandescent lights produce a large amount of heat in addition to large quantities of infrared radiation, which is likewise damaging to the fibers in antique textiles. If incandescent lights must be used, they should be placed far enough away from display cases that their heat does not affect the contents. \n\nIn the case of particularly delicate textiles, display organizers might consider motion-activated or timed lighting, or lighting controlled though a visitor-activated switch, which would allow the textiles to remain in darkness when they are not under view. All textiles should be displayed on a rotating schedule, allowing them a few months of display, then the rest of the year in dark storage, to prolong their life.\n\nHeat and humidity can both contribute and a textile’s deterioration. However, excessive dryness may also cause damage, especially to elastic fibers, such as wool, which rely on some amount of moisture to maintain their flexibility (Putnam and Finch). Additionally, temperature and humidity should be kept as constant as possible; changes in either of these may cause the textile fibers to expand and contract, which, over time, can also cause damage and deterioration to the textile. For this reason, both storage and display areas should be fitted with monitoring equipment to gauge the temperature and humidity of rooms, display cases, enclosed storage facilities, and work areas.\n\nIdeally, temperature should be kept around 70 degrees Fahrenheit, though some slight fluctuation in either direction is permissible, as long as it occurs gradually. For instance, temperature may be slightly lower in winter to save energy costs, but the change should be effected slowly, so as not to place the fibers under undue stress.\n\nAs for humidity, the preservationist or conservator should aim for a relative humidity of 50%, though, as with temperature, some small fluctuation is allowable, as long as it occurs gradually (Mailand). In enclosed display or storage cases, humidity can be somewhat maintained through the use of silica gel crystals. These crystals should not be placed in contact with the textiles, but may be placed in breathable muslin bags and hung inside the case to maintain a constant humidity; they should be monitored periodically, however, to be sure that they are working.\n\nIn areas where climate control is unavailable (such as in historic buildings), the conservator can still moderate the temperature and relative humidity through use of fans, humidifiers and dehumidifiers, and portable heating or cooling units.\n\nIn addition to temperature and humidity, air flow is also a concern for textile preservation. Textiles should never be sealed in plastic or other air-tight casing unless it is part of a treatment or cleaning process. Proper circulation, combined with the suggested humidity, will help to prevent the growth of mold and mildew, which may stain or weaken antique textiles.\n\nPests are another significant threat to textile collections, as there are a number of creatures which can cause damage to fibres. Among the most common are clothes moths, carpet beetles, silverfish, firebrats and rodents.\n\nClothes moths are attracted to protein fibres, and so are especially drawn to silk, wool, and feathers. An infestation might be identified through the evidence of white cocoons (or the remnants thereof) on the textiles, or of sighting the insects themselves. They are roughly 8 centimetres long and white in colour.\n\nLike clothes moths, carpet beetles are likewise drawn to proteins, and can be quite destructive. Evidence of an infestation may take of the form of chewed holes, carcasses, or larvae, which appear as small pale worm-like insects.\n\nSilverfish and firebrats are related insects which consume starch, usually found in sizing or other treatments applied to fabrics, as well as plant-based textiles such as linen and cotton. Both are attracted to dark, moist climates, though silverfish prefer cooler temperatures, while firebrats tend towards warmer. Both are about 12 millimetres in length and either light or dark in colouring, depending on which type is present.\n\nRodent infestations can be identified in the usual ways, such as seeing droppings, nests, or comparatively large chewed areas of textile where they have caused damage.\nIn all cases, chemical means of pest control should be avoided if possible, not only due to harm to humans who come in contact with them, but because the chemicals may cause damage to the very textiles the conservator is trying to save. For rodents, snap traps may be effective, and if needed, a professional exterminator should be called. Poison baited traps should be avoided, as the rodent could die somewhere inaccessible, and provide a breeding ground for further pests. Also, in the case of a rodent infestation, all access points to the room (such as cracks or holes) through which they might be entering should be located and sealed if possible.\n\nFor insects, keeping clean storage, display, and work environment is the best method of prevention. Also, sticky traps (replaced often) around doors, windows, and display cases may be useful for monitoring the insect population. Furthermore, the population of carnivorous insects, such as spiders, should be observed. While such insects are not harmful to textiles by themselves, they may indicate another population of insects which are.\n\nIf the infestation can be limited to one or a few pieces, the insects may be killed through freezing of the object. The textile should be wrapped in plastic and vacuum-sealed, then brought to a freezing temperature as quickly as possible, to prevent the insects from adjusting to the cold. The object may be left frozen for several days, but should be brought slowly back up to room temperature to avoid further damage. Note that while this method should kill adults, it may not destroy any eggs that are present.\n\nIf chemical means must be employed, it would be best to consult with a professional conservator to be certain that the treatment will not harm the textiles themselves.\n\nEven if no signs of an infestation are present, textiles should still be inspected periodically to be certain that there is no outbreak that has gone unobserved. Additionally, when dealing with a new acquisition which shows signs of insect damage, the specimen should be quarantined until it can be determined whether the insects are still present before introducing it to the rest of the collection.\n\nIn some cases, the textiles are weakened not by outside causes such as light or pests, but by chemical reactions taking place within the fabric itself, such as the oxidation of iron-based mordants over time, which can cause darkening and discolouration in the surrounding fibres.\n\nOne example which is cited frequently throughout the literature is the case of “shattered silk.” During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, many silk manufacturers treated their fabrics with metallic salts (usually containing tin and iron) to give them a heavier, more luxurious feel. However, as these fabrics have aged, the metals in the fibres have accelerated their decay and caused them to become extremely brittle. The shredded or “shattered” effect this causes is the reason for the name. In this case, the environment of the textile contributes very little to the deterioration from the metallic salts, though exposure to light may accelerate it even further.\n\nTextile preservationists should be familiar with their collections and the history and provenance of their pieces. Chemical tests can reveal the types of dyes and mordants used, as well as any other treatments applied to the fabric. Such knowledge can lead to the prevention of further decay by learning which pieces need to be handled with particular care.\n\nIt goes without saying that fragile and/or valuable textiles should be handled with care, and as little as necessary in any given circumstance. However, should handling be necessary, there are precautions which can be taken to ensure the safety of the textile.\n\nBecause our hands contain oils and acids in the skin, clean cloth gloves should be worn when handling textiles. If gloves are unavailable, then frequent hand-washing should be undertaken to ensure that no damage is caused. For similar reasons, the working, display, and storage areas should be free of food, drink, and cigarette smoke, which can also stain or damage the fabric. Finally, to avoid ink stains, only pencils should be used for writing or sketching in the work space.\n\nTo avoid snags and pulls, remove any jewelry that may catch in the fabric’s weave, and wear clothing free of large buckles or other objects which may snag the textile. Long hair should also be tied back to allow a clear view of the working area, even when the head is bent over the table.\n\nWhen working with the textiles, it should be placed on a clean, flat surface which is larger than the textile itself, so that the whole piece is supported evenly. Although it is supported, never place anything on top of the textile while it is in the flat position.\n\nWhen moving the textile, it is important to maintain the flat, even support of the work space. If the piece is small enough (a handkerchief or sampler, for instance), it may be placed on an acid-free board or similar support and carried as if on a tray. If the piece is too large for this (a carpet or tapestry, for example), the piece may be rolled around an acid-free tube and carried by two people to its new location.\nFinally, antique costumes and clothing should never be worn, as the mere process of putting the clothes on and taking them off will cause damage. Additionally, the model may not fit the costume precisely – clothing was for a long time made to fit a specific person, not mass-produced in approximate sizes – causing strain where there should be none and slack where there likewise should be none.\n\nOne of the safest and easiest ways to clean textiles is to vacuum them. The fabric is placed on a clean, flat work surface. If the specimen is particularly delicate, or simply as a precaution, a fibreglass screen edged with twill tape may be placed over the textile. The screen allows dirt and dust to pass through, but prevents individual threads from being pulled loose or unravelled further by the suction. Using a vacuum attachment and the lowest power setting, move the suction over the screen until the entire area has been cleaned. If needed, move the screen to a new area and begin again. Always remember to vacuum both sides of the textile, as dirt may filter through to the other side. Hanging textiles will need to be vacuumed less often than horizontal pieces, as there are fewer places where dust can collect.\n\nOne of the key standards of preservation is that of reversibility: anything done to preserve a piece should be able to be undone with minimal damage to the piece itself. Because wet cleaning is a chemical process, it is not reversible, and so should be used only when absolutely necessary.\n\nBefore cleaning a textile, certain questions should be asked to determine both the best treatment for that particular combination of textile and soil, and to ascertain whether the piece is able to be cleaned, or may sustain damage during the process.\n\nWhat is the chemical composition of the textile? In other words, does it have a high acid content? Were there chemicals used in its production that might contribute to how it reacts to water? Or how it may react to cleaning chemicals?\n\nWhat are the characteristics of the fibres? For instance, cotton and linen, being plant fibers, are both stronger wet than dry, and so may be able to withstand a more mechanical stress than something like silk. Wool can absorb large amounts of water, but mats if washed in high temperatures. All silks become brittle with age, but weighted silks (see Textile Instability above) decay more quickly, and thus must be handled with extreme care. Additionally, some silks, once wet, can be permanently spotted. Learn the basic characteristics of the type of fibres you have, and how they have been treated before undertaking any kind of cleaning.\n\nWhat colourants have been used, and how will they react to cleaning? This can apply not only to dyes but to mordants as well. Different parts of the world may have different dye processes, so here is where knowledge of when and where a textile originated, as well as a working knowledge of chemistry, can come in handy. If in doubt as to the wash ability of a dye, apply a drop or two of water to an inconspicuous place and blot with a clean white cloth. If the dye transfers to the cloth, even in small amounts, the textile should not be washed.\nAre there finishes or surface treatments that must be preserved? For example, is the fabric painted? If so, it should never be washed; some other cleaning method should be used.\n\nWhat kinds of soils are there? The older the stain, the more difficult it is to remove. After a certain point, it may be best to leave the stain or soil, or remove it only partially, in order to preserve the rest of the piece. Additionally, soils which may not be detectable to the naked eye might be present in the textile; flags, for instance, may be highly acidic due to long exposure to air pollutants, and should be treated by a professional conservator.\n\nWhat cleaner is safest and most effective? Commercial detergents should never be used on antique textiles, whatever their claims of gentleness: the chemicals used in most clothes detergents are too harsh for old fibres to withstand. A wide range of speciality detergents are available from conservation suppliers, though most sources suggest Ivory dish soap as a last-minute substitution if needed. Never use chemical spot cleaners, as they are likewise too harsh for old fibres to tolerate. This is especially important for pieces in situ, as this may endanger other nearby pieces as well (the wooden part of an upholstered piece of furniture, for instance).\n\nWhat additives and cleaning aids are needed? This can include physical supplies (water, screens, a vacuum cleaner), as well as chemical (water softener, cleaning agents, etc.).\n\nHow long can the specimen be exposed to the cleaner? Prolonged exposure may cause additional damage to the fibres.\n\nWhat mechanical action can be used? The older and more fragile a textile, the less movement it will be able to tolerate during the cleaning process, so this should be considered before undertaking a cleaning.\n\nOnce the best cleaning process has been determined, the piece should be prepared for washing. Usually, this involves vacuuming to remove any surface dirt. Linings and backing should also be removed, vacuumed, and washed separately. This is not only to prevent colour bleeding, but to avoid trapping dirt between the layers, which may cause discolouration from the inside. Additionally, different fibres react to cleaning in different ways, and fabrics may shrink or stretch, which, if they are still attached together, may cause rippling and distortion in the lining and outer layer of the textile.\n\nAs with moving or working with dry pieces, the textile should be washed in a flat, fully supported position. Usually this is achieved through the use of screens like the ones used in vacuuming, though these may be supported in a frame of some kind for added stability. The textile should be sandwiched between two screens. If the piece is particularly delicate or fragile, it may be wrapped in netting, then placed between the screens. \n\nThe cleaning solution should be prepared using distilled water. If that is unavailable, softened water may be substituted. The main concern is to avoid hard water, which will leave deposits of minerals in the fibres. The solution should be placed in a container large enough for the textile to lie flat in. For large pieces, it may be necessary to construct a temporary basin outside or in a large room: Putnam and Finch suggest using boards or bricks to constrict a frame, then lining it with a large piece of plastic, weighted on the sides, and strong enough to support the water that will be poured into it. If a smaller basin is used, it should be of ceramic, stainless steel or a stable plastic.\n\nThe screen-encased textile is lowered into the solution. The textile can then be washed by pressing a soft sponge directly down onto the fibres. DO NOT RUB the sponge, as this will cause unnecessary abrasion at a moment when the textile is already weak from the water. The textile may be submerged for no more than an hour, and should be rinsed at least four times after it is cleaned (Mailand). The final rinse should always be with distilled water. The textile should be placed to dry on a flat surface or screen, in a well-ventilated room away from heat.\n\nDry cleaning is generally only used for oil stains, as it is a very stressful process of the textile. Commercial dry cleaners should never be used, as the chemicals used in the process are too strong for old fabrics to withstand without damage. If dry cleaning is absolutely necessary, consult a professional conservator.\n\nSteaming and ironing textiles should be done with caution, as the heat may affect the viability of the fibres. More importantly, the fabric should always be cleaned before either of these processes is used, since heat may trap dirt and stains in the fibres to such an extent that the stain becomes permanent. Always use the lowest setting for either of these procedures. If a garment relies on folds to maintain its proper shape (such as pleats), it may be better to finger-press the folds into place when the garment is damp and allow it to dry that way, rather than subject it to the added stress of ironing.\n\nIf a textile item is relatively thin and light, and is safe to wet, it can be laid out flat on a piece of glass which is larger than the item. Before each use, the glass surface should be cleaned with 'safe' cleaners, as for the textile itself (see 'Wet Cleaning,' above), even if the glass has been kept in a clean place. The last rinse of the glass should ideally be with a very clean cotton cloth and distilled water.\n\nLay the textile out as flat as possible on the dry glass. Do not let the textile touch any metal or other casing that protects the edge of the glass. Old storm-windowpanes and glass shower doors are often used for this task, and they usually have their original edging left on, if it's not too bulky, for reasons of safety in handling. If the textile is known to be clean, it can be laid out dry and gently wetted to full saturation. As sections are wetted, any crumples, folds, or details (such as fringes, the picots on the edges of lace, or fine pleats) can be gently teased into place with clean fingertips so that they lie as flat as possible on the glass.\n\nSome old textiles can be flattened on glass just after washing, though it may be best to transfer to the glass fully supported, as on a netting screen or similar. The supporting fabric can be removed by rolling it out from under the textile item as it is laid out on the glass, bit by bit. Just be aware that this can stress the fibres: do not use this method on any old textile that is likely to be damaged by the handling. Let such fabrics dry first, then lay them on the glass and wet them in place.\n\nLet dry completely in a darkened place with good air-flow. The textile can be gently lifted from the glass when it's completely dry, and will usually look just as smooth as if a hot iron had been used on it.\n\nRestoration can be done with techniques like mending and darning.\n\nAs stated in the Climate section, the best storage environment for textiles is clean, dark, cool, and moderately dry, with a constant temperature and relative humidity. Ideally, there should be no strain on any one particular area of cloth. There are three basic kinds of storage for textiles, and the choice of which to use relies on the type of textile and the space available. The three types are: Flat, Rolled, and Hanging storage.\n\nFlat storage is the best option for exceptionally fragile pieces because it provides the most even support for the fibres. Enamelled metal shelves or drawers may be used, or acid-free boxes. The textiles may be placed in the boxes or drawers flat, if at all possible. If folding becomes necessary, acid-free tissue paper should be used to form soft rolls around which the folds can be shaped, to prevent creases from forming. Even so, folded textiles should be removed and refolded differently every few months, to allow even wear on the piece.\n\nFor exceptionally large textiles, such as tapestries, draperies, carpets and quilts, rolled storage is the best option. Like the upholstery section of a fabric store, the rolled storage area should consist of racks, each containing horizontally suspended acid-free or fabric-covered tubes around which the fabrics can be wrapped, being sure to line the selvages up with the edges of the roll. Textiles with a decorative side (such as velvets and embroidered textiles) should always be rolled with the decorative side facing out. This is because the inner layer, especially if there is a lining, may crease, stretch, or fold while it is on the roll. The rolled textiles can then be covered with a muslin wrapper to protect it from dust.\n\nFor costumes, flat storage may create more problems than it solves, since it is impossible to store them in this manner without forming folds and creases. Therefore, unless the costume is so weakened that it cannot support its own weight, hanging storage is perhaps the best option. Costumes which are unusually heavy (heavily beaded gowns, for instance), or those whose fabric may distort easily (such as some stretch fabrics, or those cut on the bias) should also be stored in flat storage. Garments suitable for hanging should be placed on plastic hangers which have been padded to mimic the shape of human shoulders, and covered with a plastic or cloth cover with an open bottom to allow air circulation while keeping the costume clean. Wooden hangers may have a high acid content, which may cause discolouration or decay to the costume. Likewise, metal hangers do not provide sufficient support, and may lead to distortion of the garments’ shoulders. Therefore, both forms of hanging should be avoided.\n\nIf sufficient space is available, selected garments may be stored on dummies to better keep their shape. If this method is used, dummies should be fitted out with the proper undergarments, such as bustles or panniers, to provide adequate support for the garments as they were intended to be worn. However, while the main concern of a display may be to make the garment look attractive on the dummy, storage need have no such considerations. Loose, unsupported parts of the garment (such as sleeves or shirts) should be loosely stuffed with acid-free tissue paper to provide additional support.\n\nCostume accessories can be stored in a variety of ways. Generally, bonnets and gloves should be loosely stuffed with acid-free tissue and placed in archival-quality boxes or under cover. Fans and parasols may be stored in half-open positions, which provide the least amount of stress on the fabrics.\n\nThe conditions required for display of textiles are largely those that have already been discussed in the Storage and Environment sections. Dry, cool, and dark, are to be preferred, with clean surroundings and frequent checks to be certain that the textiles are remaining in good condition. Lighting should be kept to a minimum, and textiles should be rotated through display, so that each is only exposed to light for a few months at a time before being returned to darkness or taken for cleaning/conservation work. Textiles should be vacuumed before and after display.\n\nIn France, conservators specialized in textiles arts are trained at the Institut National du Patrimoine (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage). Their mission is to intervene when heritage resources are threatened or deteriorated for several reasons. The conservator prevents works of art from disappearing or loses its purpose whilst analyzing the complex stage of its material history and the cause of alteration.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Various cultures view the sexual and cultural significance of the navel differently, and these views have changed over time, which has shaped social mores relating to the navel in design of clothing and social traditions and practices.\n\nThe public exposure of the male and female midriff and bare navel has been taboo at times in Western cultures, being considered immodest or indecent. It was banned in some jurisdictions, with some arguing that it simulated an \"erogenic orifice\". Eventually, only female navel exposure was banned and not male because, it was argued, the simulation or upward displacement from vagina to navel was commonplace and obvious in women.\n\nCommunity perceptions have changed and exposure of female midriff and navel is more accepted today and in some societies or contexts it is both fashionable and common, though not without its critics. The exposure of the male navel has not been as controversial nor as common, and is usually in the context of barechestedness. Exposure of the navel by females is commonly associated with the popularization of the bikini, of the crop top and low-rise clothing.\n\nIn the United States, the Motion Picture Production Code, or Hays Code, enforced after 1934, banned the exposure of female navel in Hollywood films. The National Legion of Decency, a Roman Catholic body guarding over American media content, also pressured Hollywood to keep clothing that exposed certain parts of the female body, such as bikinis and low-cut dresses, from being featured in Hollywood movies.\nDuring the 1950s, Joan Collins was prohibited by the censors from exposing her navel in \"Land of the Pharaohs\" (1955). To get around the censors' guidelines, she wore a jewel, a ruby, in her navel. This technique of baring the midriff but gluing a jewel on the navel was used in many other Hollywood films featuring belly dance sequences. Kim Novak wore a ruby in her navel for the film \"Jeanne Eagels\" (1957); saying in an interview, \"they had to glue it in every time. I got a terrible infection from it.\" Marilyn Monroe, for a scene from \"Some Like It Hot\" (1959), wore a dress that revealed skin everywhere but had a tiny piece of fabric to hide her navel. (The film was condemned by the National Legion of Decency, but for other reasons.)\n\nBy the 1960s, community standards had changed. Marilyn Monroe was allowed to expose her navel in \"Something's Got to Give\" (1962) and later commented, \"I guess the censors are willing to recognize that everybody has a navel.\" Ursula Andress, appearing as Honey Rider in the 1962 James Bond film, \"Dr. No\", wore her iconic white bikini, which exposed her midriff and navel. However, when Annette Funicello was cast in her first beach movie \"Beach Party\" (1963), Walt Disney, who held her contract, insisted that she only wear modest bathing suits and keep her navel covered, to preserve her wholesome persona, though she was the only one of the ample number of young women in the film not bikini-clad. In the 1967 film \"Follow That Camel\", actress Anita Harris wore a jewel on her navel for a belly dance sequence.\n\nThe Hays Code was abandoned soon after, and with it the prohibition of female navel exposure, as well as other restrictions. The influence of the National Legion of Decency had also waned by the 1960s. With the withdrawal of the Code and the change to a classification regime, the ban on the exposure of parts of the human body that had previously been regarded as immodest or indecent was withdrawn; and with it there was an increasing level of body exposure over time. The exposure of the navel ceased to be controversial in the context of a general increase in nudity.\n\nDuring the late 1980s, Disney's heroines began exposing more skin as well. In the 1989 animated film \"The Little Mermaid\", the animated lead protagonist, Ariel, flashed her navel while wearing only fins and seashells, a first in Disney's history.\n\nIn 1951, the United States Code of Practices for Television Broadcasters came into force, which, besides other things, prohibited female navel exposure on US television. During the 1960s, Barbara Eden was not allowed to show her navel on the US TV show \"I Dream of Jeannie\" (1965–70). Her pants had to be worn above the navel, which became ineffective. After a few frames of her navel exposure went unnoticed, they decided to use fabric and skin-colored make-up to cover her navel. Her costume became low rise (with no censorship) in 1985 and In 2013, Barbara Eden attended the Life Ball event in Vienna dressed in the same costume of \"I Dream of Jeannie\" but flaunting her navel. In February 1964, Scandinavian Airlines placed an advertisement in newspapers and magazines throughout America. It featured a bikini-clad blonde model exposing her bellybutton posing on a rock above the caption \"What to show your wife in Scandinavia\". The image that appeared in most publications had the belly button removed.\nThe first exposure of a navel in a TV series occurred in 1961 on the \"Dr. Kildare\" series. Dawn Wells and Tina Louise were not allowed to expose their navels in \"Gilligan's Island\" (1964–67). Wells was required to wear high-waisted shorts that covered her navel.\nWells stated in an interview, \"Oh my goodness, I designed the shorts. Because it was the first short shorts ever on television and it had to cover my navel. \"Gilligan's Island\" actually gave censors headaches back in the '60s. Ginger's cleavage, and Mary Ann's navel were only allowed 3 seconds an episode.\" The censors missed Nichelle Nichols showing her navel in the second-season \"\" episode \"\" (1967). It is believed that it was due to Bjo Trimble that it went unnoticed. Another episode of \"Star Trek\", called \"A Private Little War\" (1968), also managed to get past the censors when Nancy Kovack's belly button was clearly visible in some shots and not covered by jewelry as seen when the fringe from her top was not covering it. In 1969, Mariette Hartley was not allowed to show her belly button in \"\" (1969), the penultimate episode of Gene Roddenberry's \"Star Trek\". Gene had Mariette expose not one but two belly buttons in the sci-fi film \"Genesis II\" (1973).\n\nIn \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour\" (1971–74), network censors feared Cher's navel exposure would become a cause célèbre at CBS. Cher once commented, \"There were so many things that were censored—ideas and words. All I know is I got in trouble for showing my belly button, and every time I turned around after I went off the air, all you saw were Cheryl Ladd's boobs.\" \"People\" magazine dubbed Cher \"Pioneer of the Belly Beautiful\".\n\nThe American code of practice was suspended in 1983.\n\nNavel exposure became common in the culture of 20th-century music, starting in the 1980s, with many famous female pop stars having appeared on and offstage and in music videos with their midriff exposed, usually wearing a crop top, including Madonna, during 1983, she caused controversy when she wore a mesh crop top in her video for the song \"Lucky Star\". \"People\" magazine wrote that Madonna made the bare navel her trademark.\n\nActress Cher sported an Indian princess outfit with feathers and beads around her navel for the Academy Awards ceremony in 1986. California designer Christine Albers commented, \"the look is good for anyone who has a great body but especially for women who do a lot of stomach exercises.\"\n\nPaula Abdul's bellybutton was exposed in a fishnet see-through dress in the 1989 music video for \"Cold Hearted\" and she appeared with a tattooed navel in the music video for \"My Love Is for Real\" in 1995.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Canadian country singer Shania Twain appeared in low jeans baring her midriff and navel in her music videos and performances. It became both the most widely discussed body part in country music and her trademark. Shania once commented, \"Someone said to me once, 'Well, if I had your belly-button I'd sell 8 million albums too.' But it takes a lot more than a belly-button to sell more than 8 million albums.\" Jennifer Lopez is believed to have started the trend of exposing the navel on stage and red carpets. It has been said Christina Aguilera has the most recognizable belly button in history. \"People\" magazine stated, \"The 19-year-old hotshot chanteuse behind 'What a Girl Wants', once a Mouseketeer alongside Britney Spears, can't quite pull off pop star flash without belly-flopping.\"\nIn 2001, the editors of \"Britannica\" commissioned an article on Britney Spears that deconstructs her bare midriff. The article describes Miss Spears's navel as \"a heated boundary between baby and babe\". She had been a major inspiration for the navel piercing trend. \"Spin\" magazine chose Madonna's navel as its \"most incredible\" rock star body part for a September 2005 feature. Gregorio Luke, former director of the Museum of Latin American Art who conducted lectures about belly buttons, said, \"The belly button has been a sign of beauty in goddesses as different as Astarte, Venus or Aphrodite. We ask which is more beautiful, the perfectly round belly button of Jane Fonda or Raquel Welch's grain of coffee navel? Every star from Madonna to Shakira proudly displays their belly button.\"\n\nOn the contrary, American columnist Kathleen Parker in an article about Katharine Hepburn once commented, \"Young movie-going girls today don't have access to many in the mold of Katharine Hepburn. Instead by mall observations most are Britney wannabes—hip-hugged, tattooed, pierced and out there. The female navel has become the refrigerator man's continental divide. I hate to break it to you, oh future daughters-in-law, but everybody's got a belly button. Your inney- or outey-ness is not the stuff either of revelation or revolution.\"\n\nExposed midriff is associated with the crop top, often in association with low-rise clothing. Another way that the navel may be exposed is via a deep plunging neckline dress or top that drops below the natural waist line.\nLow-rise clothing started in the early 1990s, when the British magazine \"The Face\" featured Kate Moss in low-rise jeans on its March 1993 issue cover. Models such as Gisele Bündchen frequently flash their midriffs. In 1994, Art Cooper, editor-in-chief of \"GQ\" magazine said that his big seller in 1994 was the February issue with Geena Davis on the cover, on which she wore an Armani suit opened at the hips to reveal her navel, It sold about 400,000 copies. He stated, \"Part of the success is the navel factor. I think the belly button is really an erogenous zone.\"\n\nNavel piercing and navel tattoos has become more common among young women. The trend of piercing or tattooing the navel became popular in the 1990s. It is popular among middle-aged women. Actress Drew Barrymore has a butterfly tattoo beneath her navel. The growing popularity of belly dancing, where navel exposure is typical, has also added to the navel exposure trend.\n\nContrarily, advice columnist Ann Landers commented, \"Navels are neither sexy nor obscene. I do not believe any female of good taste would wear an outfit where her navel shows. This does not include women in costumes or those on beaches in bikinis. The same goes for males. An adult male who wears hip-huggers so low rates zero minus 10 on the scale of taste—it's my opinion but it's one I feel strongly about.\" Fashion historian James Laver told that he hasn't quite caught up with the idea of exposing the navel, saying, \"I have never regarded that as a particularly attractive part of the human anatomy\". The navel fashion returned in the 1980s, when a New York City ban on exposing the navel in public was lifted.\n\nThe importance of the navel is such that for Czech model Karolína Kurková, who does not have a navel, the magazine and catalogue art directors routinely airbrush one in for her during post-production. They keep a collection of belly button shots in different positions, and Photoshop them on to her whenever she's doing a bikini picture. Kelly Ripa has also appeared in magazine covers of Shape with morphed navels.\n\nSince 2010, the crop top evolved by which women started wearing it with a high-rise skirts, jeans, or shorts that are high enough to cover the belly button. The bandeau top also made an appearance in formal wear, usually associated with a high-rise skirt or pants that cover the navel. Actress Halle Berry wore a bandeau with matching pants to the MTV Video Music Award, fueling the trend of wearing a bandeau top as an out-of-home dress. Miley Cyrus also wore a bandeau top with cropped high waisted pants at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards and Jourdan Dunn wore a bandeau top with a long skirt.\n\nDisplays of the female navel commenced with the introduction of the bikini in 1946, designed by Louis Réard, though two-piece swimsuits that exposed the midriff but covered the navel appeared in the 1930s. Réard could not find a model who would dare wear his brief design, so he hired Micheline Bernardini, a 19-year old nude dancer from the Casino de Paris, as his model. The uptake of the new-style swimsuit was very slow, and even then the bikini was not regarded as suitable clothing beyond the beach or pool. During the 1960s, Mary Quant's designs featured exposed navels and bare midriffs.\nExposure of the male navel was limited well into the 1960s. The swimwear covered the lower abdomen and usually the navel. Occasionally the swimwear would be worn immediately below the navel. The swimwear evolved to longer legs and lower waist line. Male swimwear could not be worn above the navel nor below the knee in events of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).\n\nBikinis have become a major component of marketing various women's sports, and most female athletes often wear a sports bikini that exposes the navel as the professional attire. Bulgarian athlete Ivet Lalova is known for her \"tribal sun\" tattoo around her navel. Croatian athlete Blanka Vlašić is famous for her navel piercing.\n\nThe fashion later became increasingly popular through sporting styles tops comprising modified sports bras without additional outer garments, sports bikinis, and cheerleading style fashions developing largely from the styles originating with the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders in the early 1970s.\n\nFemale tennis players are known for exposing their navels or navel piercings on court. American tennis player Serena Williams was noted by the media for exposing her navel piercing during her matches.\nSimilarly, retired Russian tennis player Anna Kournikova was known for frequent navel exposure during her matches. In 2009, for an interview to the German magazine\n\"Der Spiegel\" when asked about her belly button showing during serves, she commented, \"These are men's ravings.Why you should hide it, when it isn't necessary? Female beach volley ball players play in bikinis - does it bother anyone?\"\nAmerican female golfer Laura Diaz commenting to the Ladies Professional Golf Association for \"Sports Illustrated\", \"The LPGA needs to acknowledge that a lot of people watch women's sports more for the women than for the sports. Why else would Anna Kournikova, who has never won a singles title, be the most popular player in women's tennis? We have quite a few attractive women, and we should use our looks to our advantage. After all, what's so wrong with seeing an occasional belly button?\"\n\nMales often wear no shirt with lower rise shorts during practice. This was somewhat upheld during practice of American football, which was carried over to wearing cropped jerseys during 1980s telecasts. Cropped jerseys became dormant for 20 years until male athletes returned to midriff exposure for comfort purposes. However, the NCAA has placed an official ban on navel exposure. The National Football League has long placed a ban on navel exposure (It has since required jerseys to be tucked in.) and banned Elliott's crop top in September 2016.\n\nThe navel is mentioned as an important element of a woman's beauty in the Song of Songs of the Hebrew Bible. It contains imagery similar to that in the love songs of ancient Egyptian literature. Song of Songs 7:2 states, \"Your navel is a rounded bowl.\" The verse preceding the line mentioning the navel (Song of Songs 7:1) states, \"your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of a master hand\", ) and the verse following states, \"Your belly is a heap of wheat.\" Thus, the description of the navel is placed textually in between the description of the curves of a woman through thigh and the stomach or midriff. \"Belly\" also suggests the womb, and the combination of the imagery of the womb with that of wheat suggests the link between eroticism and fertility through the imagery of the navel and curvaceous thighs. These passages also celebrate a curvaceous stomach and midriff and plumpness as aspects of female physical attractiveness.\n\nIn the ancient Mediterranean, Hebrew, Israelite and Middle Eastern worldview, it was a common belief that shrines, important places such as cities or capitals, or other such places of prominence had a position of centrality to the world and hence equated to the child-bearing, life-giving navel of a mother. These domains constituted what could be regarded as important bond that linked the universe. Thus Nippur, the ancient city of the Mesopotamian people, was often described as the \"navel\". This suggested to the prominence of the location and the way it was seen to function as a place of centrality and as a link between earth and the heavens and the Universe. The Greeks thought that the conical stone \"Omphalos\" (\"navel\") located at Delphi was the center of the earth.\n\nIn a similar vein, in the Jewish \"Midrashim\" it is stated, \"God created the world like an embryo. Just as the embryo begins at the navel and continues to grow from that point, so too the world. The Holy One, blessed be he, began the world from its navel. From there it was stretched hither and yon. Where is its navel? Jerusalem. And its (Jerusalem's) navel itself? The altar.\" This passage describes how the centrality of the ancient city of Jerusalem and of the altar of the ancient temple of Jerusalem within cosmic framework was equated to the navel of a mother and the source of life. This is also seen in the Book of Jubilees 8:19 and Book of Enoch 26:1 where it is describes Mount Zion as \"The center of the navel of the earth\". In Samaritan tradition Mount Gerizim is described as the navel of the earth, the only place that was not submerged in the deluge of the story of Noah's Ark. The phrase \"navel of the earth\" is used in (Ezek 38:12; Judg 9:37) Aramaic \"tibbur\" (\"navel\") and is also mentioned in Ezek 16:4. According to Samaritan tradition, Adam was made from the dust of Mount Gerizim. The navel is also celebrated in the belly dancing tradition of Mediterranean, and middle eastern cultures. When Pope Urban II called for the First Crusade, he referred to Jerusalem as \"the navel of the world\".\n\nIn Egypt, dancing in public with an uncovered navel is illegal, so many dancers wear a body stocking or netting to cover their skin. An Egyptian girl named Rubi upset members of parliament and the TV authority enough to institute a ban on music videos when a woman's navel appears.\n\nWhile the West was relatively resistant to midriff-baring clothing until the 1980s, it has long been a fashion with Indian women. These women, especially those from Southern India, have traditionally worn saris that bare the midriff. Women from Rajasthan leave the midriff exposed while wearing Ghagra Cholis. These women often cover their heads with \"dupattas\", and may cover their faces in front of strangers with \"ghoonghats\". There is a belief in India that navel-baring has a symbolic, almost mystical, association with birth and life, and that the display is meant to emphasize the centrality of nature in the nurture role. In ancient Indian tradition, the navel of the god Vishnu is considered to be the center of the universe and the source of life. From his navel a new world emerges. This has been depicted in many ancient Indian sculptures as a lotus emerging from the navel on which god Brahma is seated.\n\nAlthough women in ancient India wore saris that bared the midriff, the \"Dharmasastra\" writers stated that women should be dressed such that the navel was never visible, and navel exposure became taboo. The trend of exposing the navel was started by women who were dancers, acrobats, or entertainers, and who developed a technique of wearing the sari like a pair of trousers well below the navel to assist in the free movement of the legs. Women in this type of attire are very common in many ancient Indian sculptures, and paintings.\n\nIndian sculpture emphasised the centrality and sexuality that emanated from the depiction of the woman's navel. One of the most stunning examples would be Didarganj Yakshi, a statue of a woman made during the Mauryan period. Carved out of sandstone, which gives it a natural shine where the navel is deeply embedded within the centre of the torso, drawing the focus of the viewer. Before sculpting, the sculptors created an image and indicated the six structural centers, of which the navel is one, as defined by Yoga principles. Technically, the typical female representation in ancient Indian art includes an hourglass figure with large hips, breasts, and buttocks, and a deep navel. According to Indian physiognomy, if a woman's navel is deep, she is popular and loved by her husband. A broad, fleshy, shallow navel indicates a lucky woman. A woman with deep navel with a whirl to the right side is considered auspicious and is expected to lead a comfortable life. Famous Indian painter M. F. Husain once commented, \"The belly button has always been in. It has been an intrinsic part of the Indian woman. It has been part of Indian sculptures that go back so many centuries. That is why so many years ago, even in the 50s, all my works had women show their belly buttons.\"\n\nWith their migration to different countries, many Indian women began to wear the normal sari below the waistline, exposing the navel in a style known as a low-rise or low hip sari. The trend started during the 1950s, when saris were worn below the navel, with big pleats that were tightly draped across the curves of the body. Due to liberalization and changing global markets, saris are re-emerging as erotic apparel. As a result, saris began to be designed in innovative ways using different materials, such as transparent and semi-transparent saris made of sheer fabrics like chiffon. These modern saris may be draped in different ways, such as a petticoat being tied about below the navel, just above the pubic area, and a small blouse ending just below the breasts with a thin \"pallu\" exposing some part of the blouse and almost the entire midriff. In September 2012, \"The New York Times\" featured a wedding announcement with an image of a woman of Indian heritage displaying her navel in a \"gagra choli\" for the first time. This style was popularised by Bollywood celebrities and other popular regional film industries, such as Tamil and Telugu cinema. \nIn ancient Indian tradition, the navel of Lord Vishnu is considered to be the source of life and creativity. There's almost some sort of fascination with the navel in India, because it is considered to be a symbol of birth and life. That means in ancient India, women would wear sari that bared their midriffs. \n\nIndian television actors have followed suit, wearing saris that expose more skin, including the navel, with viewers mimicking the styles.\n\nSome women wear navel jewels or navel piercings to emphasize the navel and enhance its appeal. Another option is using \"bindis\" to decorate the navel. Tattoos near or below the navel were becoming popular in cities such as Pune in early 2012. Actresses Mandira Bedi and Chhavi Mittal are known for their unique tattoos on their navels.\n\nSometimes the low-rise style is modified, with the navel being covered by the pallu when wearing a low-rise non-transparent sari. In some corporations in India, saris are required to be worn in a manner that avoids navel exposure. Anita Gupta, Senior Vice-President at J. Walter Thompson in Chennai commented that formal wear for woman should not expose the navel.\n\nIndian actresses have expressed comfort with the practice of exposing their navels in film, preferring it to showing cleavage and calling it uncontroversial.\n\nSouth Indian actresses such as Silk Smitha, Simran, Kiran Rathod, Namitha, Trisha Krishnan, Anushka Shetty, Shriya Saran, Ileana D'Cruz, Kajal Aggarwal, Mumtaj, Taapsee Pannu, Shruti Hassan, Tamannaah, Samantha Ruth Prabhu, Nayanthara, Shwetha Menon, etc., are known for their navel exposure. Actresses such as Ileana D'Cruz, Tamannaah, Shriya Saran etc., are known for exposing their slim midriffs in song sequences.\n\nDuring the 1990s, scenes focusing on the female protagonist's navel were common in Tamil cinema. Actress Sukanya became famous for a scene in the 1992 film \"Chinna Gounder\", where the main protagonist spins a top on the female protagonist's navel. The 1993 film \"Gentleman\" featured a scene in the song sequence where female protagonist's navel is poked with a sword. In 1996, actress Nagma became known for acting in a food play scene in the Tamil film \"Love Birds\", which involves the male protagonist breaking an egg and cooking it on her navel, which was similar to a scene from \"Hot Shots!\" (1991) involving Valeria Golino. In the early 2000s Simran Bagga was known for her navel exposure in films. Her pierced navel also drew many youths to the cinema for the 2002 film \"Pammal K. Sambandam\".\nIn his review of \"Isai\" (2015), film critic Baradwaj Rangan stated that \"Sulagna brings to mind the heroines of a certain era who were chosen not because they had beautiful eyes or a bewitching smile but because of the quiver-quotient of their navel when confronted by a close-up.\" Film critic Sudhir Srinivasan wrote in a review for the 2016 film \"Aranmanai 2\", \"The emphasis is not so much on making a horror story that is novel, than it is on fixating on the heroine’s navel.\"\n\nOf the South Indian film industries, Telugu cinema more frequently has actresses expose their navels. Film scholar Mahesh Kathi commented that Telugu cinema has a long history of \"fondness for the navel\", citing old South Indian temple architecture, which features numerous prominent displays of navels in their carvings, and calling such displays a \"South Indian aesthetic sensibility\". He continued, \"Cinematically, while cleavage is just a peek at the bosom, the navel encompasses the woman's entire sensuality. \nThe 1978 film \"Maro Charitra\" was the first to feature the scene where a top spins on the female protagonist's navel. \n\nVeteran Telugu film director Kovelamudi Raghavendra Rao's movies always have guaranteed navel show of the heroines. He used to include the navel of the heroine in every possible frame and exploit it in song sequences such as dropping of water, flowers, fruits, ice cubes etc., on the navel. Prominent Telugu actor and director Dasari Narayana Rao had once commented, \"When you see a heroine slightly removing her pallu to show her inside assets, you don't feel ashamed of it because of the artistic way in which Ragahvendra Rao projects it on the screen. Especially heroines' navels look most beautiful in his movies.\" \nTelugu actor and politician Chiranjeevi had commented in a TV show, \"If you want to know about fruits, you have to do one film with director K. Raghavendra Rao. He used to put all the fruits around the heroine’s navel (boddu).\"\nIn 2016, actress Pragya Jaiswal had requested Raghavendra Rao to have a shot with fruits and flowers on her navel as part of a song sequence. She told in an interview,\"That's the third day of shooting with KRR sir and we're canning a song. But actually he's not making any flower or fruit thrown at my navel or waist, that's why I took courage to ask him to hit my navel with them\"\n\nThe 2013 Telugu film \"Action 3D\" paid tribute to Raghavendra Rao with a song featuring his symbolic acts on the female protagonist's navel.\nA song sequence in the 2012 Telugu spoof film \"Sudigadu\" features the main protagonist dropping a watermelon and a pumpkin on the female protagonist's navel.\nActress Monal Gajjar who has acted in the scene had commented on an interview, \"When the hero throws it on my tummy I am supposed to scream with a strange sound and they told me they are not real, all are toy fruits.\"\n\nFemale dancers of Bollywood have always exposed their navels, since Amrapali (1966), with cameras focused on them. In the 1968 Bollywood film \"Brahmachari\", actress Mumtaz was seen in a Sharara sari showing her navel for a song and dance number, \"Aaj kal tere mere\". A Sharara has a long blouse top with a unique divided skirt bottom, which has less flow than \"lehenga\". It fits like a loose pant until reaching the knee, where it flares out. The particular style of sari became extremely popular and was dubbed the Mumtaz Sari. The 1981 film \"Ek Duuje Ke Liye\", a remake of the 1978 \"Maro Charitra\" featured the replication of the \"top spinning on the navel\" scene with Rati Agnihotri. She had stated in an interview,\"Today, when someone asks me how I balanced the top, I don't have an answer.Those days we didn't have monitors, the luxury of too many rehearsals or retakes. I did what was expected of me, telling myself it was like dramatics day in school, only instead of the stage I was facing a camera\". The film \"Khalnayak\" (1993) was famous for the song \"Choli ke Peeche\" featuring Madhuri Dixit in navel-exposing attire. In the 2003 film \"Jism\", actress Bipasha Basu appeared in a foreplay scene with an ice cube on her navel. Actress Aishwarya Rai showcased her navel in a brocade \"choli\" and dipped \"ghagra\" for the hit song \"Kajra Re\" in the film \"Bunty Aur Babli\" (2005). Katrina Kaif became famous for her dance performance showcasing her navel for the item number Sheila Ki Jawani for the 2010 film \"Tees Maar Khan\". Film critic Baradwaj Rangan stated on his blog in a review for the film, \"Katrina Kaif makes her entry in the well-shot, well-scored Sheela ki jawani song sequence, brandishing a belly button that seems to have a life of its own\". For the 2011 film \"The Dirty Picture\", actress Vidya Balan had acted in a scene where an egg put on her navel becomes an omelette. She stated in an interview, \"It was difficult to control laughter and Milan used to wait to get me into the character because all this was part of the song and dance of those times to market the Silk phenomenon\". Recently, Rakhi Sawant appeared in an item song \"Latto Ghuma Re Chora\" for the 2012 film \"Rakhtbeej\" in which a top is spun on her midriff and navel. She stated in an interview that the filming was painful since the director spun the sharp-pointed top 30 times on her midriff.\n\nThe Censor Board of India for Indian cinema has created some limitations on \"vulgar\" visuals, such as restricting zoom shots of the navel, kissing the navel, and squeezing the navel and waist. It had been implemented during the 1990s. Many films have faced censor cuts for navel scenes.\n\nMany actors have expressed mixed views on the display of and emphasize of the navel. Some feel displaying the midriff or navel cannot be considered exposing when compared to Hollywood films. Actress Shilpa Shetty argued, \"If navel-showing is obscenity, then our traditional Indian outfitthe traditional sarishould be banned in the first place.\" Actress, BJP member and CBFC member Jeevitha while speaking on item numbers stated, \"Dance numbers are okay, but girls don't need to dress vulgarly. They can wear skirts but not too much below the navel.\" Telugu film director Krishna Vamsi commented, \"All film-makers have problems with the censors. They sometimes object to showing the navel of a woman when, in other films, it is allowed. We cannot even question them. The censors should give us general rules in writing as to what is allowed and what is not, instead of taking decisions according to their whims and fancies.\" Actor R. Madhavan commented, \"I have often been embarrassed to see certain films I have done. ... when I see myself kissing a dancing heroine's navel in some films, I feel ashamed.\" Actress Taapsee Pannu commented, \"I believe the navel is overrated. I think sensuality can be expressed in other ways.\" Bengali actress Swastika Mukherjee said, \"I am not very comfortable though I have tried wearing a \"lehenga choli\" with a stick-on in my navel.\" Many actresses have opted to hide their navels by wearing trikinis for beach or pool scenes.\n\nJapan has long had a special regard for the navel. During the early Jōmon period in northern Japan, three small balls indicating the breasts and navel were pasted onto flat clay objects to represent the female body. The navel was exaggerated in size, informed by the belief that the navel symbolizes the center of where life begins. On many middle Jomon figurines, the significance of the navel was emphasized with an indentation or hole. Sometimes, the importance of the navel was further enhanced by connecting with a line from the navel towards the chest. Early Japanese poems feature many references to the female navel. In some, the word \"navel\" actually refers to an indentation or hole instead of the belly button. The shape of the umbilicus of a newborn baby would be discussed at length. If a baby's navel points downward, the parents would brace themselves for a weakling child who will bring them woe. The thunder god Raijin, with his terrifying drums, great horns, and long tusks, was said to have an insatiable appetite for young navels, and mothers had to nag their youngsters constantly to keep themselves well covered up. Due to the mythology, navel exposure was not encouraged in the earlier times. The traditional clothing of Japanese women has a wide cloth belt around the midriff to protect the belly and keep it warm. The Japanese believe the belly is the source of person's warmth and that the perfect navel is an innie.\n\nAlthough navel exposure has become a recent trend in fashion in Japan, annual \"Heso Matsuri\" (\"belly button festivals\") have been held in Japan since the late 1960s. The tradition of the Hokkaido \"Heso Odori\" (\"belly button dance\") began in 1968. Dancers make their \"heso\" (\"belly button\") into a face, using paint, special costumes, and props. Many variations of the dance have been developed, leading to competitions among dancers, who compete for prizes in various categories.\n\nA similar type festival is held at Shibukawa, north of Tokyo. The idea was formed based on the location of Shibukawa, which is also referred to as the \"Belly Button of Japan\". The festival is based on a traditional Japanese form of entertainment where revelers paint a face on their torsos and stomachs to appear as a head. A \"kimono\" is wrapped around the waist, and the person's real head is hidden by a large cloth hat. The belly button is traditionally painted into a mouth. In recent years, modern motifs and Japanese anime designs have appeared in the festival.\n\nSigiriya frescoes depict royal ladies wearing cloth draped as a \"dhoti\", tied in a knot at the front and pulled down to expose the navel. They wear pleated robes from the waist upwards, as well a necklace, armlets, wristlets, ear and hair ornaments, and display their breasts. The ladies in waiting wear waist clothes, a few ornaments and a firm \"thanapatiya\" (\"breast bandage\").\n\nIn the Sinhalese poetic work Kaviyasekara, a father advises his married daughter as to proper clothing, \"Dress your garment above your navel, without exposing the fair bosom, and expose not your teeth in laughing.\"\n\nIn his work \"Daily Code for the Laity\" (1898), the Buddhist leader Anagarika Dharmapala wrote that a sari blouse must be long, fully covering a woman's breasts, midriff, navel, and back.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, a visible navel was very rare. By the late 1990s, the Bollywood connection and the media and technological changes that occurred in India had influenced Sri Lanka's fashion outlook, with the navel becoming a focus in the modern Sri Lankan wardrobe. Sri Lankan films commonly depict the women of the country's earliest history as scantily clad with exposed navels, and the country has become more open to the topic in general. In Nov 2015, Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya stated that a school dress code for students and teachers would be issued requiring that the navel be covered. However, the Ceylon Teachers Union President Joseph Stalin condemned it and commented, \"We condemn this statement. It is an anachronistic proposal. We see nothing wrong with teachers wearing sarees below the belly button. It may be that there is something wrong with Mr. Devapriya’s eye sight. We like to ask the Chief Minister whether the belly button is the main concern facing the education sector in the Western Province\".\n\nIn 2004, the President of Indonesia Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono spoke out against exposed navels, saying, \"Indonesian women, who are known for their courtesy, should refrain from exposing their midriffs or belly buttons, which now seems to be taken for granted. There are many ways to express beauty, as part of aesthetics, and to express freedom but not by showing things that lead to pornography.\" He further added that while the state could not dictate dress codes, citizens were expected to respect the country's moral values and courtesy. A week later, a cabinet minister quoted Yudhoyono as saying that he felt \"disturbed and uneasy\" to see television shows in which women exposed their navels.\n\nIn 2006, Agus Suwage, an Indonesian artist, installed his Pinkswing Park exhibit at Jakarta's international biennale.The exhibit was surrounded by massive panels with multiple pictures of a near-naked man and woman frolicking in a park. Within days of the exhibition's launch, Islamic fundamentalists had descended on the biennale, forcing its closure and demanding prosecutions. At first police claimed his work blasphemed the story of Adam and Eve; a few weeks later they told Suwage he faced five years in jail for producing pornography. The Indonesian parliament decided to introduce a sweeping anti-pornography law. The law imposes a rigid social template; couples who kiss in public will face up to five years' jail, as would anyone flaunting a \"sensual body part\"—including their navel—and tight clothing will be outlawed. Due to this new anti-pornography law, topless bathing and surfing on the beaches of Bali, a common practice among tourists, would also be prohibited. The law would also affect older tribal women, who often still walk topless. The introduction of a bill was attacked by women's rights campaigners in the country, who fear it is the first step towards the implementation of Islamic Sharia law.\n\nDespite these laws, pop singers such as Inul Daratista, known for her hip swaying moves, and Agnez Mo continue exposing their navels, but undergo some restrictions in advertisements.\n\nTraditionally, Korean women are expected to dress modestly. The traditional wear such as Hanbok cover the entire body.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the fashion trend among young South Korean women for wearing cropped T-shirts that leave the midriff exposed had started, due to the hot climatic conditions. The trend spread to create changes in female fashion such that when a policeman in Gwangju arrested two young women for flaunting their belly buttons in the street, the judge threw the case out, ruling that the flashing of a female navel was not indecent. It further became popular due to Korean pop culture, where K-pop stars started wearing body piercings and midriff-exposing shirts. In July 1997, the South Korean broadcaster KBS announced tough new rules for pop stars appearing on TV. One among the many limitations was \"no exposing of navels\".\n\nDuring the 2000s, it became common among young women to expose their belly buttons by rolling up their shirts similar to a crop-top. During sport events such as football, the female audience apply body paints or temporary tattoos around their belly buttons. In 2010, Korean girl group Rainbow's dance routine that involved lifting up their shirts to expose their navels became popular. The band stated in an interview, \"We have to keep our abs in shape for the belly button dance.\" But the routine was subsequently has been banned. The SBS TV show \"Inkigayo\" told girl groups to restrain showing their skin too much and about their outfits. In 2013, Yoona, a member of Korean girl band Girls' Generation, caused a minor controversy by revealing an exposed midriff featuring a protruding cantaloupe-like outie navel, which started a spirited discussion and polarized opinions on the Chinese-language internet.\n\nAlthough, the formal wear is expected to cover the stomach and belly button.\n\nIn 2005, Vivienne, a virtual girlfriend created by software maker Artificial Life Inc. of Hong Kong, was reprogrammed not to bare her navel or display body piercings in conservative Muslim countries including Malaysia to avoid problems. In 2006, Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat gave his blessings to an Islamic form of dance clubs to serve as entertainment outlets at Kota Bharu. He commented that there must be proper attire for women, including clothes that do not reveal the navel, saying Muslim women must be covered from head to toe except for their face and hands, while Muslim men must be decently dressed when in public. Under Malaysian government rules for stage performances, a female artist must be covered from her shoulders to her knees. This law prevented pop icon Beyoncé Knowles from performing in navel-exposing attire in 2007. Beyoncé canceled the show amid opposition from local groups, calling the cancellation a result of a \"scheduling conflict\".\n\nSaint Thomas Aquinas considered the navel as the \"bodily metaphor for spiritual things\".\n\nIn Indian traditional medicine, the \"Cyperus rotundus\" tuber is made into a paste and applied around the navel to relieve pain caused by roundworms. Pomegranate plant juice and paste is used to treat snake bites; the juice is dropped into the nostrils, ears, and navel. Applying a little bit of ghee or mustard oil on cotton and keeping it on the navel overnight is considered a remedy for dry lips. Castor oil is applied to the navel of infants as a remedy for stomach aches. The Gonds, a tribe from central India, apply \"Gloriosa superba\" rhizome extract over the navel and vagina to cause labour pain and perform normal delivery.\n\nAccording to Ayurveda, the navel is an important site in the human body. Nearly 72,000 subtle nerves, or \"nadis\" converge in this area. By the principles of Ayurveda and yoga, the human body is made up of six \"chakras\", with the \"Manipura chakra\" located at the spine directly behind either the navel or the solar plexus, depending on the system, while its \"kshetram\", or superficial activation point, is located directly on the navel and represents the element fire. Vayu or vital wind as specified in Ayurveda, is divided into five sub categories. Of these, Samāna Vayu, situated in the navel region, is believed to aid in digestion and give physical strength to the body.\n\nAccording to Ayurvedic principles, navel displacement is a condition in which the navel center shifts.\nThis might create digestive disorders. Proper practice of yoga is considered to be a remedy to realigning the navel.\n\nIn Sri Lanka traditional medicine, a composition of herbs, powdered pepper, and water is applied as a paste to the navel as a remedy for stomach aches. During difficulties in delivery, a betel leaf is placed on the woman's navel, which is believed to be under a spell.\n\nLaying wormwood on the female navel or spreading a paste of reindeer lichen on the navel were considered by Russian women to make the delivery of a child fast and painless.\n\nIn the Chinese art of acupuncture, the navel is sometimes referred to as 神阙 (\"shénquè\", roughly translating to divine imperfection or mark of the ancestors). Often, the navel is used as a moxibustion point. However, the navel itself is not used in acupuncture due to the likelihood of infection.\n\n"}

It garnered one million hits in its first week on YouTube.\n\nOn 16 December 2012, a horrific gang-rape of an Indian girl took place in a moving bus in New Delhi, the national capital of India. The event was followed by various protests in which masses took to the streets in various Indian states, demanding the government to form stricter laws regarding women safety. The media industry voiced its concern in its own way. One such way was the women-empowerment ad campaign 'Dekh Le', launched one year after the incident.\n\nThe 90 second video shows four different scenarios where women are made to feel uneasy and uncomfortable by male gaze in everyday life situations. It shows women at a red light, in a bus, on a train and at a cafe, being subjected to staring male eyes. In order to retaliate, these women show mirrors to the men; on seeing how bad they look while staring at a girl, realize their mistake and are forced to take their eyes off. The video concludes with the four empowered women going about their business, free from prying eyes.\nThe jingle was sung by famous Indian singer Sona Mohapatra and composed by Ram Sampath. The hook line \"Dekh Le Tu Dekhta Hua Kaisa Dikhta Hai\" translates as \"Look how you look while you are looking at me.\"\n\nThe ad found a lot of media coverage, both on online news websites and blogs, as well as offline newspapers and magazines.\nRheana Murray from New York Daily News described the video: \"Video from Indian arts group shows leering men what they look like.\"\nDeepa Kunapuli from Upworthy wrote \"It's meant to start a conversation about what empowerment for women looks like.\"\nEmma Cueto from Bustle writes, \"The video is great, both in its very realistic – and uncomfortable – portrayal of men staring at young women, and also in the message it is trying to send.

{"id": "2738515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2738515", "title": "Digital theatre", "text": "Digital theatre\n\nStrictly, digital theatre is a hybrid art form, gaining strength from theatre’s ability to facilitate the imagination and create human connections and digital technology’s ability to extend the reach of communication and visualization. (However, the phrase is also used in a more generic sense by companies such as Evans and Sutherland to refer to their fulldome projection technology products.)\n\nDigital theatre is primarily identified by the coexistence of “live” performers and digital media in the same unbroken(1) space with a co-present audience. In addition to the necessity that its performance must be simultaneously “live” and digital, the event’s secondary characteristics are that its content should retain some recognizable theatre roles (through limiting the level of interactivity) and a narrative element of spoken language or text. The four conditions of digital theatre are:\n\n\nA brief clarification of these terms in relation to digital theatre is in order. The significance of the terms “live” or “liveness” as they occur in theatre can not be over-emphasized, as it is set in opposition to digital in order to indicate the presence of both types of communication, human and computer-created. Rather than considering the real-time or temporality of events, digital theatre concerns the interactions of people (audience and actors) sharing the same physical space (in at least one location, if multiple audiences exist). In the case of mass broadcast, it is essential that this sharing of public space occurs at the site of the primary artistic event.(6) The next necessary condition for creating digital theatre is the presence of digital media in the performance. Digital media is not defined through the presence of one type of technology hardware or software configuration, but by its characteristics of being flexible, mutable, easily adapted, and able to be processed in real-time. It is the ability to change not only sound and light, but also images, video, animation, and other content into triggered, manipulated, and reconstituted data which is relayed or transmitted in relation to other impulses which defines the essential nature of the digital format. Digital information has the quality of pure computational potential, which can be seen as parallel to the potential of human imagination.\n\nThe remaining characteristics of limited interactivity and narrative or spoken word are secondary and less distinct parameters. While interactivity can apply to both the interaction between humans and machines and between humans, digital theatre is primarily concerned with the levels of interactivity occurring between audience and performers (as it is facilitated through technology).(7) It is in this type of interactivity, similar to other types of heightened audience participation,(8) that the roles of message sender and receiver can dissolve to that of equal conversers, causing theatre to dissipate into conversation. The term “interactive” refers to any mutually or reciprocally active communication, whether it be a human-human or a human-machine communication.\n\nThe criteria of having narrative content through spoken language or text as part of the theatrical event is meant not to limit the range of what is already considered standard theatre (as there are examples in the works of Samuel Beckett in which the limits of verbal expression are tested), but to differentiate between that which is digital theatre and the currently more developed fields of digital dance9 and Art Technology.(10) This is necessary because of the mutability between art forms utilizing technology. It is also meant to suggest a wide range of works including dance theatre involving technology and spoken words such as Troika Ranch’s The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz (Troika Ranch, 2000), to the creation of original text-based works online by performers like the Plain Text Players or collaborations such as Art Grid’s Interplay: Hallucinations, to pre-scripted works such as the classics (\"A Midsummer Night’s Dream\", \"The Tempest)\" staged with technology at the University of Kansas and the University of Georgia.\n\nThe Participatory Virtual Theatre efforts at the Rochester Institute of Technology take a different approach by have live actors use motion capture to control avatars on a virtual stage. Audience responses are designed into the software that supports the performance. In the 2004 production, \"What's the Buzz?\" (17), a single node motion capture device controlled the performance of a swarm of bees. Later performances use two motion capture systems located in different buildings controlling the performance on a single virtual stage (18).\n\nThese criteria or limiting parameters are flexible enough to allow for a wide range of theatrical activities while refining the scope of events to those which most resemble the hybrid “live”/mediated form of theatre described as digital theatre. digital theatre is separated from the larger category of digital performance (as expressed in the overabundance of a variety of items including installations, dance concerts, Compact discs, robot fights and other events found in the Digital Performance Archive).\n\nIn the early 1980s, video, satellites, fax machines, and other communications equipment began to be used as methods of creating art and performance. The groups Fluxus and John Cage were among the early leaders in expanding what was considered art, technology, and performance. With the adaptation of personal computers in the 1980s, new possibilities for creating performance communications was born. Artists like Sherrie Rabinowitz and Kit Galloway began to transition from earlier, more costly experiments with satellite transmission to experiments with the developing internet. Online communities such as The Well and interactive writing offered new models for artistic creativity. With the ‘Dot Com’ boom of the 1990s, telematic artists including Roy Ascott began to develop greater significance as theatre groups like George Coates Performance Works and Gertrude Stein Repertory Theatre established partnerships with software and hardware companies encouraged by the technology boom.In Australia in the early 1990s Julie Martin's Virtual Reality Theatre presented works at the Sydney Opera House, featuring the first hybrid human digital avatars, in 1996 \"A Midsummer Nights Dream featured Augmented Reality Stage sets designed and produced by her company. Researchers such as Claudio Pinanhez at MIT, David Saltz of The Interactive Performance Laboratory at the University of Georgia, and Mark Reaney head of the Virtual Reality Theatre Lab at the University of Kansas, as well as significant dance technology partnerships (including Riverbed and Riverbed’s work with Merce Cunningham) led to an unprecedented expansion in the use of digital technology in creating media-rich performances (including the use of motion capture, 3D stereoscopic animation, and virtual reality as in The Virtual Theatricality Lab‘s production of \"The Skriker\" at Henry Ford Community College under the direction of Dr. George Popovich. Another example is the sense:less project by Stenslie/Mork/Watz/Pendry using virtual actors that users would engage with inside a VR environment. The project was shown at ELECTRA, Henie Onstad Art Center, Norway, DEAF 1996 in Rotterdam and the Fifth Istanbul Biennial (1997).\n\nEarly use of mechanical and projection devices for theatrical entertainments have a long history tracing back to mechanicals of ancient Greece and medieval magic lanterns. But the most significant precursors of digital theatre can be seen in the works of the early 20th century. It is in the ideas of artists including Edward Gordon Craig, Erwin Piscator (and to a limited degree Bertolt Brecht in their joint work on Epic Theatre), Josef Svoboda, and the Bauhaus and Futurists movements that we can see the strongest connections between today’s use of digital media and live actors, and earlier, experimental theatrical use of non-human actors, broadcast technology, and filmic projections.\n\nThe presence of these theatrical progenitors using analog media, such as filmic projection, provides a bridge between Theatre and many of today’s vast array of computer-art-performance-communication experiments. These past examples of theatre artists integrating their modern technology with theatre strengthens the argument that theatrical entertainment does not have to be either purist involving only “live” actors on stage, or be consumed by the dominant televisual mass media, but can gain from the strengths of both types of communication.\n\nDigital theatre does not exist in a vacuum but in relation to other terminology. It is a type of Digital Performance and may accommodate many types of “live”/mediated theatre including “VR Theatre”(11) and “Computer Theatre,”(12) both of which involve specific types of computer media, “live” performers, story/words, and limited levels of interactivity. However, terms such as “Desktop Theatre,”(13) using animated computer avatars in online chat-rooms without co-present audiences falls outside digital theatre into the larger category of digital performance. Likewise, digital dance may fall outside the parameters of digital theatre, if it does not contain elements of story or spoken words.\n\n\"Cyberformance\" can be included within this definition of Digital theatre, where it includes a proximal audience: \"Cyberformance can be created and presented entirely online, for a distributed online audience who participate via internet-connected computers anywhere in the world, or it can be presented to a proximal audience (such as in a physical theatre or gallery venue) with some or all of the performers appearing via the internet; or it can be a hybrid of the two approaches, with both remote and proximal audiences and/or performers.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The term is used for works of fiction which combine the literary devices of metafiction with historical fiction. Works regarded as historiographic metafiction are also distinguished by frequent allusions to other artistic, historical and literary texts (i.e. intertextuality) in order to show the extent to which works of both literature and historiography are dependent on the history of discourse.\n\nThe term is closely associated with works of postmodern literature, usually novels. According to Hutcheon, in \"A Poetics of Postmodernism\", works of historiographic metafiction are \"those well-known and popular novels which are both intensely self-reflexive and yet paradoxically also lay claim to historical events and personages\". Works often described as examples of historiographical metafiction include: William Shakespeare's \"Pericles, Prince of Tyre\" (c.1608), John Fowles' \"The French Lieutenant's Woman\" (1969), E. L.

The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore simplicity should be a key goal in design, and that unnecessary complexity should be avoided. The phrase has been associated with aircraft engineer Kelly Johnson. The term \"KISS principle\" was in popular use by 1970. Variations on the phrase include: \"Keep it simple, silly\", \"keep it short and simple\", \"keep it simple and straightforward\", \"keep it small and simple\" and \"keep it stupid simple\".\n\nThe acronym was reportedly coined by Kelly Johnson, lead engineer at the Lockheed Skunk Works (creators of the Lockheed U-2 and SR-71 Blackbird spy planes, among many others).\n\nWhile popular usage has transcribed it for decades as \"Keep it simple, stupid\", Johnson transcribed it as \"Keep it simple stupid\" (no comma), and this reading is still used by many authors. There was no implicit meaning that an engineer was stupid; just the opposite.\n\nThe principle is best exemplified by the story of Johnson handing a team of design engineers a handful of tools, with the challenge that the jet aircraft they were designing must be repairable by an average mechanic in the field under combat conditions with only these tools. Hence, the \"stupid\" refers to the relationship between the way things break and the sophistication available to repair them.\n\nThe acronym has been used by many in the U.S. military, especially the U.S. Navy and United States Air Force, and in the field of software development.\n\nThe principle most likely finds its origins in similar minimalist concepts, such as Occam's razor, Leonardo da Vinci's \"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication\", Mies Van Der Rohe's \"Less is more\", Bjarne Stroustrup's \"Make Simple Tasks Simple!\", or Antoine de Saint Exupéry's \"It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away\". Colin Chapman, the founder of Lotus Cars, urged his designers to \"Simplify, then add lightness\". Heath Robinson machines and Rube Goldberg's machines, intentionally overly-complex solutions to simple tasks or problems, are humorous examples of \"non-KISS\" solutions. Also Shakespeare's \"Brevity is the soul of wit\".\n\nA variant — \"Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler\" — is attributed to Albert Einstein, although this may be an editor's paraphrase of a lecture he gave.\n\nMaster animator Richard Williams explains the KISS principle in his book \"The Animator's Survival Kit\", and Disney's Nine Old Men write about it in \"\", a considerable work of the genre. The problem faced is that inexperienced animators may \"over-animate\" in their works, that is, a character may move too much and do too much. Williams urges animators to \"KISS\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "249650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=249650", "title": "Mommie Dearest", "text": "Mommie Dearest\n\nMommie Dearest is a memoir and exposé written by Christina Crawford, the adopted daughter of actress Joan Crawford. Published in 1978, it described the author's upbringing by an unbalanced alcoholic mother, who she judged unfit to raise children. The book attracted much controversy regarding child abuse and child trafficking, with many family friends denouncing it as fiction, but others claiming that it was a broadly accurate, if exaggerated, account of Christina’s troubled childhood. It was turned into a film starring Faye Dunaway.\n\nIn the book, Christina contends that Joan used to hit her with objects because of alcoholism and that Joan placed more importance on being famous and ignored being a parent. Christina suggests that Joan may have adopted children as a publicity stunt to support her career. She implies Joan had a long list of affairs with men, who Christina was required to call \"Uncle\" and rarely \"Daddy\", and that Joan also had many affairs with women. Christina suggests that as she grew older and more difficult to control, Joan found excuses to remove Christina from the home by sending her to various boarding schools and strict religious academies, often specifying in her instructions that Christina must be allowed no contact with the outside world. Often, the schools were used to punish Christina for defying her mother or fighting back against abusive behavior.\n\nChristina recounts several evenings on which Joan's behavior was unbalanced, and at least one encounter with her mother where Joan attempted to strangle her. In another encounter, Joan reportedly discovered Christina's clothes hanging in a closet on wire hangers, instead of higher-quality crochet hangers, and reprimanded her harshly. In an incident in which Christina refused to eat very rare beef, Joan ordered the meat returned to the refrigerator and refused to allow Christina any other food for several days until she finished the meal, but Christina managed to hold out until her mother gave up and allowed her regular meals again. Joan allegedly disposed of her children's possessions to punish them for minor transgressions. Joan also supposedly strapped Christina's younger adopted brother, Christopher, to his bed each night until he was twelve, ostensibly to control his sleepwalking.\n\nChristina reported that Joan's controlling and erratic behavior continued throughout Christina's adulthood. She asserts that Joan was jealous of her daughter's burgeoning acting career to the point of taking over Christina's role in the soap opera \"The Secret Storm\" while Christina was in the hospital recovering from an ovarian cyst. (Christina's character was twenty-eight years old; Joan was then in her sixties.) She also used money to control the adult Christina's behavior by taking her out for expensive meals and paying for taxis while refusing to give Christina money for basic living expenses. This culminated in Christina learning that she and her brother Christopher had been left out of Joan's will, even though Christina believed that they had reconciled with their mother.\n\nThe book's publication in 1978 created an enormous amount of attention.\n\nSome of Joan's friends disputed the version of events presented in \"Mommie Dearest\". Among them were Van Johnson, Cesar Romero, Bob Hope, Barbara Stanwyck, Sydney Guilaroff, Ann Blyth, Gary Gray, and particularly Myrna Loy, Joan's friend since 1925. While acknowledging that Joan was highly ambitious and an alcoholic for much of her life, critics have suggested that Christina embellished her story. Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Crawford's first husband, described the book by stating, \"The Joan Crawford that I've heard about in \"Mommie Dearest\" is not the Joan Crawford I knew back then.\" The two younger Crawford children, Cindy and Cathy, born 1947 and both adopted by Crawford, have stated categorically many times that they did not witness or experience any of the events that were described in the book. However, Christopher always staunchly defended Christina's claims, saying of their mother in 1978, \"I honestly to this day do not believe that she ever cared for me.\"\n\nLiz Smith, writing in the \"Baltimore Sun\", said, \"I was inclined to believe Joan was misguided in her attempts to 'mold' her children—and was vain and self-absorbed like most great stars—but the stories of beatings and near-madness were over the top.\" Crawford's secretary for nearly 50 years, Betty Barker, also stated that while Joan was strict, Christina and Christopher were never abused.\n\nHowever, Joan's friends Helen Hayes, James MacArthur, June Allyson, Rex Reed, and Betty Hutton have verified some of the stories in Christina's book and claimed they also witnessed some of the abuse in person. Hutton had previously lived near Crawford's Brentwood home and has stated that she saw the children during or after various moments of abuse. Hutton stated she would often encourage her own children to play with Christina and Christopher to draw them away from their challenges at home. Joan's \"Mildred Pierce\" co-star, actress Eve Arden, sided with Christina about Joan's parenting abilities and said that she suffered from bipolar disorder and was a good woman in many ways but as an alcoholic with a violent temper, she was simply unfit to be a mother. In the book \"Understanding the Borderline Mother\", author Christine Ann Lawson suggests that Joan may have had borderline personality disorder (BPD), along with an obsessive compulsion with cleanliness.\n\nThe last pages of Christina's book suggest that she was not about to let her mother have the \"last word\" by omitting her daughter from her will. Later biographers have reported that Christina began writing her book before Crawford's death and have suggested that Joan's knowledge of its contents may have been a factor in Joan Crawford cutting her daughter from her will.\n\nChristina has stood by her story and later released a \"20th Anniversary Edition\", which includes 100 pages of new material and omits about 50 pages of original material. The second edition names certain individuals not named in the original book and focuses more on Christina's relationship with her mother from her high school graduation until the 1970s. It also reveals what became of her brother and describes several incidents involving him.\n\nReleased by a smaller publishing company, the second edition included some unconventional promotional methods. In 1981, the book had been adapted as a movie starring Faye Dunaway to which the shocked Christina gave negative feedback and lectures on the new edition at screenings of the film. Christina also appeared at readings with drag entertainer Lypsinka, who has made numerous appearances as Joan Crawford during stage acts. \n\nIn 2017 Crawford worked with lyricist and composer David Nehls on a stage musical adaptation of \"Mommie Dearest\", which was produced by Out of the Box Theatrics in New York City.\n\n\n"}

She was the leader of the major Japanese political party, the Democratic Party.\n\nBorn Hsieh Lien-fang () in Tokyo to a Taiwanese father () and Japanese mother (), she studied at Aoyama Gakuin in Tokyo from kindergarten through university. She enrolled in the law faculty of Aoyama Gakuin University and graduated in 1990 with the B.L. degree in Public Law. Born as a citizen of the Republic of China , she did not become a citizen of Japan until 1985 when the Nationality Law was amended to allow Japanese mothers to pass Japanese nationality to their children. She was legally a dual citizen until 2016. She adopted her mother's surname, , when she acquired Japanese citizenship; to avoid name confusion in her career, she began to go simply by Renhō.\n\nAfter her debut as a Clarion Girl in 1988, Renhō appeared on several television and radio programs as a commentator. In 1993, she became a newscaster on TBS and TV Asahi, covering several historical events including the Great Hanshin earthquake.\n\nShe was married in 1993 and studied the Chinese language at Peking University from 1995 to 1997. Renhō returned to television in 2000, anchoring and reporting on several TBS programs. She reported from Taiwan during Chen Shui-bian's presidential campaign, which brought her to the attention of Taiwanese political leaders. In Taiwan, she is often referred to as Lien-fang, the Standard Chinese pronunciation of her given name.\n\nIn July 2004, Renhō was elected to the House of Councillors representing Tokyo as a member of the Democratic Party of Japan. Since election, she has been heavily involved in parenting issues and policies. Renhō has criticized Japan's diplomacy with China and its refusal to recognize Taiwan, stating that \"Japan is too polite when dealing with China, taking a low profile\" and \"Taiwan is my father's country. Why isn't Taiwan a country?\" Since taking office, she has traveled to Taiwan several times on official and unofficial business, garnering extensive public and media attention, and has become close to senior members of the Democratic Progressive Party.\n\nAfter the DPJ assumed the reins of government in September 2009, she received much public attention for her stern stance and direct questions to bureaucrats during special fiscal screening committees of the established under Yukio Hatoyama.\n\nIn June 2010, then Prime Minister Naoto Kan appointed her as Minister for Administrative Reforms. Upon taking the post, Renhō stated that she would be giving particular attention to eliminating waste in the 21 government account. She lost her seat in Cabinet in a subsequent reshuffle, but was retained as a special advisor to the Prime Minister.\n\nIn the 2010 House of Councillors election, she garnered a record 1,710,734 constituency votes.\n\nShe also served as a member of the Cabinet of Japan from 2010 to 2012, serving as Minister for Government Revitalisation and Minister of State for Consumer Affairs and Food Safety.\n\nIn September 2011, she was re-appointed as State Minister of Government Revitalization (responsible for administrative reforms) in the cabinet of then prime minister Yoshihiko Noda. Her new portfolio also included responsibility for civil service reform, gender equality and Japan's declining birthrate. She served in this post until a cabinet reshuffle in January 2012.\n\nThe DPJ was ousted from government in the 2012 general election, following which Renhō returned to the opposition bench. She retained her seat in the 2016 House of Councillors Election.\n\nIn September 2016, she was elected as the leader of Japan's Democratic Party, making her the first woman elected as their leader and the first person with mixed ethnic heritage and dual-citizenship to head a major political party in Japan.\n\nUpon her election as president of the Democratic Party, \"The Japan Times\" reported on several of her policies. They reported that she is opposed to revisions of Article 9 of the Constitution, but is willing to join debates with the Liberal Democratic Party on other constitutional revisions. They also reported that she views Abenomics to be a partial success, but pushes for greater investment in education, child-rearing and nursing care. She has also ruled out forming a coalition government with the Japanese Communist Party and opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nDuring the presidential election, Renhō claimed that she had given up her Taiwanese citizenship. However, reports emerged that her Taiwanese citizenship had not been properly renounced. In response to doubts regarding her legal status, she took steps to renounce her Taiwanese citizenship beginning in late 2016.\n\nIn July 2017, the Democratic Party suffered a very poor showing in the Tokyo prefectural election. Some senior party members blamed the results, in part, on the ongoing questions surrounding Renhō's citizenship. In response to these concerns, she provided evidence of her renunciation of Taiwanese citizenship at a press conference later that month.\n\nDays after her press conference, and days following the resignation of former prime minister Yoshihiko Noda as party secretary-general, Renhō resigned as head of the party, stating that she had not shown sufficient ability to lead it.\n\nDissatisfied with the ambiguous direction of the DP leadership post the 2017 election, Renho expressed interest in joining the new progressive Constitutional Democratic Party and had an exploratory talk with CDP leader Yukio Edano in mid-December. She applied to join the CDP on December 26, 2017 citing the DP's lack of policy directions and the CDP's conversely clear policy directions. The CDP admitted her into the party on December 28, 2017.\n\nHer husband, , is a journalist and a guest lecturer at several universities. In 1997, she gave birth to twins. She has two siblings, one brother who is one year older, and one brother who is two years younger.

He became known, early in his career, for writing, starring in and producing Edwardian musical comedy, often together with his famous wife, Ellaline Terriss. His most famous acting role was that of Ebenezer Scrooge in Charles Dickens's \"A Christmas Carol\".\n\nMaking his stage début at the age of nine and performing professionally by sixteen, Hicks joined a theatrical company and toured America before starring in \"Under the Clock\" in 1893, the first musical revue ever staged in London. Following this, he starred in a revival of \"Little Jack Sheppard\" at the Gaiety Theatre, London which brought him to the attention of impresario George Edwardes. Edwardes cast Hicks in his next show, \"The Shop Girl\", in 1894. Its success led to his participation in two more of Edwardes's hit \"girl\" musicals, \"The Circus Girl\" (1896) and \"A Runaway Girl\" (1898), both starring Terriss. He first played the role of Ebenezer Scrooge in 1901 and eventually played it thousands of times onstage. Hicks, along with his wife, joined the producer Charles Frohman in his theatre company and wrote and starred in a series of extraordinarily successful musicals, including \"Bluebell in Fairyland\" (1901), \"Quality Street\" (1902), \"The Earl and the Girl\" (1903) and \"The Catch of the Season\" (1904).\n\nHicks used his fortune from these shows to commission the building of the Aldwych Theatre in 1905 and the Hicks Theatre in 1906, opening the latter with a new hit show, \"The Beauty of Bath\". His stage performances were less successful in later years, and he opted instead to star in music hall tours, including \"Pebbles on the Beach\" (1912). He continued to write light comedies, the most popular of which was \"The Happy Day\" (1916). On film, he first appeared in \"Scrooge\" and \"David Garrick\" both from 1913. Later notable films included \"The Lambeth Walk\" (1939) and \"Busman's Honeymoon\" (1940), and his last film was in the year of his death, 1949.\n\nHicks was born in St. Hélier on the island of Jersey. At the age of nine, he appeared as Little Buttercup in Gilbert and Sullivan's \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" at his school in Bath. After that, he was determined to be an actor.\n\nHicks first appeared professionally on stage at the age of sixteen in a production of \"In the Ranks\" at the Grand, Islington. In 1889, he joined the theatrical company of Mr. and Mrs. Kendal for an American tour where they presented a repertory of contemporary plays. Hicks starred as Dr. Watson in the first revue show ever staged in London, \"Under the Clock\" (1893), a parody of Sherlock Holmes and Watson written by Hicks with Charles Brookfield (who played Holmes), at the Royal Court Theatre. That same year, he married Ellaline Terriss. After that, he starred in a revival of \"Little Jack Sheppard\" at the Gaiety Theatre, London. This brought him to the attention of the impresario George Edwardes. In 1894, Hicks joined his wife in the successful \"Fairy pantomime\", \"Cinderella\", produced by Henry Irving with music by Oscar Barrett, where she had been playing the title role. He played Thisbe, one of Cinderella's half-sisters who, in this version, were \"Girton College girls who can jabber Greek and Latin, read French, play golf, and indulge in manly exercises. Thisbe has an affectation for intellectuality – Ibsen, Spooks, and the new humor.\"\n\nEdwardes gave Hicks the chance to star in his next show, \"The Shop Girl\" (1894), which became a hit at the Gaiety in 1894, playing for 546 performances. Hicks's wife joined Edwardes's company during the run of the show, replacing the star in the title role, and together they made the musical an even bigger hit. The following year, Hicks transferred with the show to Broadway for a short run and then toured in America in 1895 with his wife, where they befriended the American novelist Richard Harding Davis. At the instance of W. S. Gilbert, Hicks wrote a drama called \"One of the Best\", a vehicle for his father-in-law William Terriss at the Adelphi Theatre, based on the famous Dreyfus Trial. The Hickses were frequent guests of Gilbert at his estate in Grim's Dyke. Hicks hurried back from America for the opening in December 1895. It ran for over a year.\n\nAnother early success for the young couple was \"The Circus Girl\" (1896). Hicks and Terriss both had a comedy background, and they transformed the \"lovers\" roles in the new genre of Edwardian musicals from overly sentimental to mischievous and light-hearted characters exchanging witty banter. Hicks then worked as co-author on \"The Yashmak\" and then on one of the Gaiety Theatre's most successful shows, \"A Runaway Girl\" (1898), in which Terriss played the title role. This was followed by \"With Flying Colours\" (1899). Also in 1899, Hicks starred as the Duc De Richelieu in \"A Court Scandal\", a comedy adapted by Aubrey Boucicault and Osmond Shillingford from \"Les Premières Armes de Richelieu\" by Dumanoir, at the Court Theatre. The same year, he and Terriss adopted a daughter, Mabel, and Terriss gave birth to their second child, Elizabeth (\"Betty), in 1904.\n\nIn early 1900, the Hickses played in their only Broadway show together, \"My Daughter-in-law\", at the Frohman brothers' old Lyceum Theatre. They then joined forces with producer Charles Frohman and, in his company, over a period of seven years, they played the leads in a series of musicals written by Hicks, including \"Bluebell in Fairyland\" (1901 with music by Walter Slaughter and lyrics by Charles Taylor – this Christmas show for children was continually revived for the next four decades) and \"The Cherry Girl\" (1902). Hicks and Terriss also starred in \"Quality Street\" in 1902. At that time, they moved to a new home, The Old Forge, at Merstham, Surrey. Their cul-de-sac was renamed \"Quality Street\".\n\nHicks also wrote the highly successful \"The Earl and the Girl\" (1903) and the successful \"The Catch of the Season\" (1904 with Herbert Haines and Taylor). Ellaline was pregnant with Betty, and so Zena Dare originated the leading role in \"The Catch of the Season\" until Terriss could assume the role. Hicks wrote, and Frohman produced, \"The Talk of the Town\" (1905 with Haines and Taylor), \"The Beauty of Bath\" (1906 with Haines and Taylor; the show included additional lyrics by newcomer P. G. Wodehouse and additional music by Jerome Kern), \"My Darling\" (1907 with Haines), and \"The Gay Gordons\" (1907). Hicks used some of the fortune he received from these shows to build the Aldwych Theatre in 1905 and the Hicks Theatre in 1906, which was renamed the \"Globe Theatre\" in 1909 and then the \"Gielgud Theatre\" in 1994. \"The Beauty of Bath\" was the first production at the theatre.\n\nIn \"The Dashing Little Duke\" (1909; with C. Hayden Coffin, Courtice Pounds and Louie Pounds), produced by Hicks at the Hicks Theatre, which was less successful, Hicks' wife played the title role (a woman playing a man). When she missed several performances due to illness, Hicks played the role – possibly the only case in the history of a musical where a husband succeeded to his wife's role. The piece was based on \"A Court Scandal\", in which Hicks had played in 1899. Hicks then wrote and starred in \"Captain Kidd\" (1910), an adaptation with music and lyrics by Leslie Stuart and Adrian Ross, of the American farce \"The Dictator\" (1904 by Richard Harding Davis). This flopped, bringing an end to the era of supremacy in London's musical theatre of Hicks and Terriss. Hicks appeared in his first Shakespeare play that year, \"Richard III\". The same year, he penned the first of several autobiographies. The following year, he took a company on a tour of South Africa. After the outbreak of World War I, Hicks was the first British actor to bring a tour to France (with Terriss), giving concerts to British troops at the front. Because of this, he was awarded the French Croix de Guerre. Hicks was briefly declared bankrupt in 1915.\n\nHicks and Terriss concentrated on comedy roles and music hall tours in later years, including \"Pebbles on the Beach\" (1912), singing and dancing 'Alexander's Ragtime Band'. Their one return to musical comedy, \"Cash on Delivery\" (1917), confirmed the public's preference for comedy revues and music hall. Hicks continued to write light, escapist comedies, such as \"The Happy Day\" (1916), \"Sleeping Partners\" (1917) and, after the war, satiric farces, such as \"Good Luck\" and \"Head Over Heels\" (1923) and adaptations of French farces (\"The Man in Dress Clothes\").\n\nHicks appeared in three early silent films: \"Scrooge\" and \"David Garrick\" in 1913, and \"A Prehistoric Love Story\" in 1915. He decided in 1923 to produce his own films. His first film, in which he starred, was \"Always Tell Your Wife\", which was based on one of his plays. While making that film, Hicks fired the director and hired an unknown young director to make his debut: Alfred Hitchcock. Hicks directed \"Sleeping Partners\" (1930) and \"Glamour\" (1931). In addition, over a dozen films were made either from his plays or his scripts, and he starred in about twenty films, many with his wife. One of his early films was \"Money for Nothing\" (1932)\n\nIn 1931, he was awarded the Legion of Honour for his promotion of French drama on the English stage. In 1934, he had taken over Daly's Theatre in London, where he produced and appeared in a series of successful plays including \"Vintage Wine\" that he and Ashley Dukes adapted from a novel.\n\nHicks's most famous role was that of Ebenezer Scrooge in Charles Dickens's \"A Christmas Carol\". He first played this role in 1901 and eventually played it thousands of times onstage, often at benefits, and twice on film: the 1913 silent film \"Scrooge\" and the 1935 film \"Scrooge\", produced in England. In 1926, Pathé Pictures released the 1913 film in America under the title \"Old Scrooge\". This 1926 print has been released on DVD. The 1935 \"Scrooge\" was the first feature-length film version of the story with sound. The film has been praised for its vivid atmosphere, but most of the ghosts in the film are not seen on screen, except for the Ghost of Christmas Present (Oscar Asche). Donald Calthrop portrays Bob Cratchit, and Maurice Evans has a bit part as one of Scrooge's debtors. Most prints in circulation are of the abridged, six-reel (hour-long) version. The film was seldom seen due to the popularity of the 1938 and the 1951 film versions of Dickens's novel. Poor-quality prints were shown on television in the 1980s, but in 2002 the film was restored to its original eight-reel length and issued on DVD. In 2007 the hour-long version was issued in a colourised edition.\n\nAmong his other film appearances, Hicks starred in the film version of his show \"Vintage Wine\" (1935) and as Sir John Tremayne in \"The Lambeth Walk\" (1939), the film version of the stage musical \"Me and My Girl\", \"Young Man's Fancy\" (1939), \"Pastor Hall\" (1940) and \"Busman's Honeymoon\" (1940). Hicks wrote for films until 1941 (\"Kisses for Breakfast\", in which he starred, based on the French play \"The Matrimonial Bed\" by André Mouëzy-Éon and Yves Mirande). When World War II began, he acted, on 12 November 1939, as the master of ceremonies at the first concert given in France by the newly formed ENSA (Entertainment National Service Association). For this action, Hicks was awarded his second Croix de Guerre.\n\nHicks was knighted in 1934. Later films included \"Fame is the Spur\" (1947) and \"Silent Dust\" (1949). He continued appearing on stage and in films until a year before his death in Hampshire, England, at the age of 78.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27866702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27866702", "title": "The Silmarillion", "text": "The Silmarillion\n\nThe Silmarillion is a collection of mythopoeic works by English writer J. R. R. Tolkien, edited and published posthumously by his son, Christopher Tolkien, in 1977, with assistance from Guy Gavriel Kay. \"The Silmarillion\", along with J. R. R. Tolkien's other works, forms an extensive, though incomplete, narrative that describes the universe of Eä in which are found the lands of Valinor, Beleriand, Númenor, and Middle-earth, within which \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" take place.\n\nAfter the success of \"The Hobbit\", Tolkien's publisher requested a sequel. Tolkien sent them an early draft of \"The Silmarillion\" but they rejected the work as being obscure and \"too Celtic\". The result was that Tolkien began work on \"A Long Expected Party\", the first chapter of what he described at the time as \"a new story about Hobbits\", which became \"The Lord of the Rings\".\n\n\"The Silmarillion\" comprises five parts. The first part, \"Ainulindalë\", tells of the creation of Eä, the \"world that \"is\"\". \"Valaquenta\", the second part, gives a description of the Valar and Maiar, the supernatural powers in Eä. The next section, \"Quenta Silmarillion\", which forms the bulk of the collection, chronicles the history of the events before and during the First Age, including the wars over the Silmarils that gave the book its title. The fourth part, \"Akallabêth\", relates the history of the Downfall of Númenor and its people, which takes place in the Second Age. The final part, \"Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age\", is a brief account of the circumstances which led to and were presented in \"The Lord of the Rings\".\n\nThe five parts were initially separate works, but it was the elder Tolkien's express wish that they be published together. Because J. R. R. Tolkien died before he finished revising the various legends, Christopher gathered material from his father's older writings to fill out the book. In a few cases, this meant that he had to devise completely new material in order to resolve gaps and inconsistencies in the narrative.\n\n\"The Silmarillion\", like Tolkien's other Middle-earth writings, was meant to have taken place at some time in Earth's past. In keeping with this idea, \"The Silmarillion\" is meant to have been translated from Bilbo's three-volume \"Translations from the Elvish\", which he wrote while at Rivendell.\n\nChapters in the book include:\n\nThe inside title page contains an inscription written in Tengwar. In the common script, it reads \"The tales of the First Age when Morgoth dwelt in Middle-earth and the Elves made war upon him for the recovery of the Silmarils to which are appended the downfall of Númenor and the history of the Rings of Power and the Third Age in which these tales come to their end.\"\n\nThe first section of \"The Silmarillion\", \"Ainulindalë\" (\"The Music of the Ainur\"), takes the form of a primary creation narrative. Eru (\"The One\"), also called Ilúvatar (\"Father of All\"), first created the Ainur, a group of eternal spirits or demiurges, called \"the offspring of his thought\". Ilúvatar brought the Ainur together and showed them a theme, from which he bade them make a great music. Melkor – whom Ilúvatar had given the \"greatest power and knowledge\" of all the Ainur – broke from the harmony of the music to develop his own song. Some Ainur joined him, while others continued to follow Ilúvatar, causing discord in the music. This happened thrice, with Eru Ilúvatar successfully overpowering his rebellious subordinate with a new theme each time. Ilúvatar then stopped the music and showed them a vision of Arda and its peoples. The vision disappeared after a while, and Ilúvatar offered the Ainur a chance to enter into Arda and govern over the new world.\n\nMany Ainur descended, taking physical form and becoming bound to that world. The greater Ainur became known as the Valar, while the lesser Ainur were called the Maiar. The Valar attempted to prepare the world for the coming inhabitants (Elves and Men), while Melkor, who wanted Arda for himself, repeatedly destroyed their work; this went on for thousands of years until, through waves of destruction and creation, the world took shape.\n\n\"Valaquenta\" (\"Account of the Valar\") describes Melkor and each of the 14 Valar in detail, as well as a few of the Maiar. It also reveals how Melkor seduced many Maiar – including those who would eventually become Sauron and the Balrogs – into his service.\n\n\"Quenta Silmarillion\" (\"The History of the Silmarils\"), which makes up the bulk of the book, is a series of interconnected tales set in the First Age that make up the tragic saga of the three jewels, the Silmarils.\n\nThe Valar had attempted to fashion the world for Elves and Men, but Melkor continually destroyed their handiwork. After he destroyed the two lamps that illuminated the world, the Valar moved to Aman, a continent to the west of Middle-earth, where they established their home called Valinor. Yavanna created Two Trees that illuminated Valinor and left Middle-earth to darkness and Melkor. Soon after, stars created by Varda began to shine and the Elves awoke. The elves originally formed three groups: the Vanyar, the Noldor, and the Teleri, though some elves were captured and enslaved by Melkor, eventually to be bred into orcs. Knowing the danger the Elves were in, the Valar decided to fight Melkor to keep the Elves safe. After defeating and capturing Melkor, they invited the Elves to live in Aman. Many Elves travelled to Aman, while others refused and still others stopped along the way, including the Elves who later became the Sindar, ruled by the Elf King Thingol and Melian, a Maia. Of the three tribes that set out, all of the Vanyar and Noldor, and many of the Teleri reached Aman.\n\nIn Aman, Fëanor, son of Finwë, King of the Noldor, created the Silmarils, jewels that glowed with the light of the Two Trees. Melkor, who had been held in captivity by the Valar, was eventually released after feigning repentance. Upon release, Melkor deceived Fëanor into believing that his eldest half-brother Fingolfin was attempting a coup against Finwë. This rift led to the banishment of Fëanor from the Noldor city Tirion, and Fëanor thereafter created the fortress Formenos to the North of Tirion. Finwë moved to Formenos to live with Fëanor, his favourite of three sons, and there they safely kept the Silmarils. After many years, Fëanor travelled to Tirion to make amends with Fingolfin, while Finwë stayed at Formenos. While making amends, Melkor destroyed the Two Trees with the help of Ungoliant, a dark spider spirit Melkor found in Avathar, on the Southeast side of Aman. Together, Melkor and Ungoliant then escaped to Formenos, killed Finwë, stole the Silmarils, and fled to Middle-earth. Melkor kept the Silmarils and banished Ungoliant, later attacking the Elvish kingdom of Doriath, ruled by the Elf King Thingol and his wife Melian. He was defeated in the first of five battles of Beleriand, however, and barricaded himself in his northern fortress of Angband.\n\nFëanor and his sons swore an oath of vengeance against Melkor – and against anyone who withheld the Silmarils from them, even the Valar. Fëanor persuaded most of the Noldor to pursue Melkor, whom Fëanor renamed as Morgoth, into Middle-earth. Fëanor's sons seized ships from the Teleri, attacking and killing many of them, and left the other Noldor to make the voyage by foot. Upon arriving in Middle-earth, the Noldor under Fëanor attacked Melkor and defeated his host, though Fëanor was slain by Balrogs. After a period of peace, Melkor attacked the Noldor but was again defeated and besieged. Nearly 400 years later, he broke the siege and drove the Noldor back.\n\nAfter the destruction of the Trees and the theft of the Silmarils, the Valar created the moon and the sun. At the same time, Men awoke, some of whom later arrived in Beleriand and allied themselves with the Elves. Beren, a man who had survived the latest battle, wandered to Doriath, where he fell in love with the elf Lúthien, the king's daughter. The king sought to prevent their marriage by imposing what he believed an impossible task: retrieving one of the Silmarils from Melkor. But together, Beren and Lúthien embarked on this quest. Sauron, a powerful servant of Melkor, imprisoned Beren along the way; but with Lúthien's help he escaped, crept into Melkor's fortress, and stole a Silmaril from Melkor's crown. Having achieved the task, the first union of man and elf was formed, though Beren was soon mortally wounded and Lúthien also died of grief. However she convinced the Vala Mandos to revive Beren and herself, choosing to sacrifice her immortality in favour of a mortal life with her beloved.\n\nThe Noldor, seeing that a mortal and an elf-woman could infiltrate Angband, perceived that Melkor was not invincible. They attacked again with a great army of Elves, Dwarves and Men. But they were deceived by Melkor, who had secretly darkened the hearts of many of the men. Thus it was that the Elvish host were utterly defeated, due in part to the treachery of some Men. However, many Men remained loyal to the Elves and were honoured thereafter.\n\nNone received more honour than the brothers Húrin and Huor. Huor died in battle, but Melkor captured Húrin, and cursed him to watch the downfall of his kin. Húrin's son, Túrin Turambar, was sent to Doriath, leaving his mother and unborn sister behind in his father's kingdom (which had been overrun by the enemy). Túrin achieved many great deeds of valour, the greatest being the defeat of the dragon Glaurung. Despite his heroism, however, Túrin was plagued by the curse of Melkor, which led him unwittingly to murder his friend Beleg and to marry and impregnate his sister Nienor, whom he had never met before, and who had lost her memory through Glaurung's enchantment. Before their child was born, the bewitchment was lifted as the dragon lay dying. Nienor, realizing what grew within her, took her own life. Upon learning the truth, Túrin threw himself on his sword.\n\nHuor's son, Tuor, became involved in the fate of the hidden Noldorin kingdom of Gondolin. He married the elf Idril, daughter of Turgon, Lord of Gondolin (the second union between Elves and Men). When Gondolin fell, betrayed from within by Maeglin, Tuor saved many of its inhabitants from destruction. All of the Elvish kingdoms in Beleriand eventually fell, and the refugees fled to a haven by the sea created by Tuor. The son of Tuor and Idril, Eärendil the Half-elven, was betrothed to Elwing, herself descended from Beren and Lúthien. Elwing brought Eärendil the Silmaril of Beren and Lúthien, and using its light Eärendil travelled across the sea to Aman to seek help from the Valar. The Valar obliged; they attacked and defeated Melkor, completely destroying his fortress Angband and sinking most of Beleriand; and they expelled Melkor from Arda. This ended the First Age of Middle-earth. The last two Silmarils were taken by Fëanor's surviving sons Maedhros and Maglor. However, Maedhros killed himself by leaping into a fiery chasm with a Silmaril while Maglor threw his into the sea and spent the rest of his days wandering along the shores of the world, singing his grief.\n\nEärendil and Elwing had two children: Elrond and Elros. As descendants of immortal elves and mortal men, they were given the choice of which lineage to belong to: Elrond chose to belong to the Elves, his brother to Men. Elros became the first king of Númenor and lived to 500 years old, being given an extended life in return for choosing to be a Man.\n\n\"Akallabêth\" (\"The Downfallen\") comprises about 30 pages, and recounts the rise and fall of the island kingdom of Númenor, inhabited by the Dúnedain. After the defeat of Melkor, the Valar gave the island to the three loyal houses of Men who had aided the Elves in the war against him. Through the favour of the Valar, the Dúnedain were granted wisdom and power and life more enduring than any other of mortal race had possessed, making them comparable to the High-Elves of Aman. Indeed, the isle of Númenor lay closer to Aman than to Middle-earth. But their power lay in their bliss and their acceptance of mortality. The fall of Númenor came about in large measure through the influence of the corrupted Maia Sauron (the chief servant of Melkor), who arose during the Second Age and tried to conquer Middle-earth.\n\nThe Númenóreans moved against Sauron, who saw that he could not defeat them by force and allowed himself to be taken as a prisoner to Númenor. There he quickly enthralled the king, Ar-Pharazôn, urging him to seek out the immortality that the Valar had apparently denied him, thus nurturing the seeds of envy that the Númenóreans had begun to hold against the Elves of the West and the Valar. So it was that all the knowledge and power of Númenor was turned towards seeking an avoidance of death; but this only weakened them and sped the gradual waning of the lifespans to something more similar to that of other Men. Sauron urged them to wage war against the Valar themselves to win immortality, and to worship his master Melkor, whom he said could grant them their wish. Ar-Pharazôn created the mightiest army and fleet Númenor had seen, and sailed against Aman. The Valar and Elves of Aman, stricken with grief over their betrayal, called on Ilúvatar for help. When Ar-Pharazôn landed, Ilúvatar destroyed his fleet and drowned Númenor itself as punishment for the rebellion against the rightful rule of the Valar. Ilúvatar created a great wave, such as had never before been seen, which utterly destroyed and submerged the isle of Númenor, killing all but those Dúnedain who had already sailed east, and changing the shape of all the lands of Middle-earth.\n\nSauron's physical manifestation was also destroyed in the ruin of Númenor, but as a Maia, his spirit returned to Middle-earth, no longer able to take upon himself the fair form he once had. Some Númenóreans who had remained loyal to the Valar were spared and were washed up on the shores of Middle-earth. Among these survivors were Elendil their leader, a descendant of Elros, and his two sons Isildur and Anárion who had also saved a seedling from Númenor's white tree, the ancestor of that of Gondor. They founded the Númenórean Kingdoms in Exile: Arnor in the north and Gondor in the south. Elendil reigned as High-king of both kingdoms, but committed the rule of Gondor jointly to Isildur and Anárion. The power of the kingdoms in exile was greatly diminished from that of Númenor, \"yet very great it seemed to the wild men of Middle-earth\".\n\nAt the end, it is mentioned that the sunken Númenor came to be called \"Atalantë\", a name not used when it existed. This led many readers to the conclusion that Númenor is Atlantis; this direct link was, however, denied by Tolkien himself, who asserted that it's a natural word following the constructs of Quenya.\n\nThe concluding section of the book, comprising about 20 pages, describes the events that take place in Middle-earth during the Second and Third Ages. In the Second Age, Sauron emerged as the main power in Middle-earth, and the Rings of Power were forged by Elves led by Celebrimbor. Sauron secretly forged his own ring to control the others, which led to war between the peoples of Middle-earth and Sauron, culminating in the War of the Last Alliance, in which Elves and the remaining Númenóreans united to defeat Sauron, bringing the Second Age to an end. The Third Age began with the passing of the One Ring to Isildur, who was ambushed at the Gladden Fields shortly afterwards, and lost the ring in the River Anduin. This section also gives a brief overview of the events leading up to and taking place in \"The Lord of the Rings\", including the waning of Gondor, the re-emergence of Sauron, the White Council, Saruman's treachery, and Sauron's final destruction along with the One Ring, after which the ages of magic end.\n\nTolkien first began working on the stories that would become \"The Silmarillion\" in 1914, intending them to become an English mythology that would explain the origins of English history and culture. Much of this early work was written while Tolkien, then a British officer returned from France during World War I, was in hospital and on sick leave. He completed the first story, \"The Fall of Gondolin\", in late 1916.\n\nHe called his collection of nascent stories \"The Book of Lost Tales\". This became the name for the first two volumes of \"The History of Middle-earth\", which include these early texts. The stories employ the narrative device of a mariner named Eriol (in later versions, an Anglo-Saxon named Ælfwine) who finds the island of Tol Eressëa, where the Elves live; and the Elves tell him their history. However, Tolkien never completed \"The Book of Lost Tales\"; he left it to compose the poems \"The Lay of Leithian\" and \"The Lay of the Children of Húrin\".\n\nThe first complete version of \"The Silmarillion\" was the \"Sketch of the Mythology\" written in 1926 (later published in Volume IV of \"The History of Middle-earth\"). The \"Sketch\" was a 28-page synopsis written to explain the background of the story of Túrin to R. W. Reynolds, a friend to whom Tolkien had sent several of the stories. From the \"Sketch\" Tolkien developed a fuller narrative version of \"The Silmarillion\" called \"Quenta Noldorinwa\" (also included in Volume IV). The \"Quenta Noldorinwa\" was the last version of \"The Silmarillion\" that Tolkien completed.\n\nIn 1937, encouraged by the success of \"The Hobbit\", Tolkien submitted to his publisher George Allen & Unwin an incomplete but more fully developed version of \"The Silmarillion\" called \"Quenta Silmarillion\", but they rejected the work as being obscure and \"too Celtic\". The publisher instead asked Tolkien to write a sequel to \"The Hobbit\". Tolkien began to revise \"The Silmarillion\", but soon turned to the sequel, which became \"The Lord of the Rings\". He renewed work on \"The Silmarillion\" after completing \"The Lord of the Rings\", and he greatly desired to publish the two works together. But when it became clear that would not be possible, Tolkien turned his full attention to preparing \"The Lord of the Rings\" for publication.\n\nIn the late 1950s Tolkien returned to \"The Silmarillion\", but much of his writing from this time was concerned more with the theological and philosophical underpinnings of the work than with the narratives themselves. By this time, he had doubts about fundamental aspects of the work that went back to the earliest versions of the stories, and it seems that he felt the need to resolve these problems before he could produce the \"final\" version of \"The Silmarillion\". During this time he wrote extensively on such topics as the nature of evil in Arda, the origin of Orcs, the customs of the Elves, the nature and means of Elvish rebirth, and the \"flat\" world and the story of the Sun and Moon. In any event, with one or two exceptions, he wrought little change to the narratives during the remaining years of his life.\n\nFor several years after his father's death, Christopher Tolkien compiled a \"Silmarillion\" narrative. Christopher's intentions seem to have been mostly to use the latest writings of his father's that he could, and to keep as much internal consistency (and consistency with \"The Lord of the Rings\") as possible, though he admitted that a complete consistency was impossible. As explained in \"The History of Middle-earth\", Christopher drew upon numerous sources for his narrative, relying on post-Lord of the Rings works where possible, but ultimately reaching back as far as the 1917 \"Book of Lost Tales\" to fill in portions of the narrative which his father had planned to write but never addressed. In one later chapter of \"Quenta Silmarillion\", \"Of the Ruin of Doriath\", which had not been touched since the early 1930s, he had to construct a narrative practically from scratch. The final result, which included genealogies, maps, an index, and the first-ever released Elvish word list, was published in 1977.\nBecause of Christopher's extensive explanations (in \"The History of Middle-earth\") of how he compiled the published work, much of \"The Silmarillion\" has been debated by readers. Christopher's task is generally accepted as very difficult given the state of his father's texts at the time of his death: some critical texts were no longer in the Tolkien family's possession, and Christopher's task compelled him to rush through much of the material. Christopher reveals in later volumes of \"The History of Middle-earth\" many divergent ideas which do not agree with the published version. Christopher Tolkien has suggested that, had he taken more time and had access to all the texts, he might have produced a substantially different work. But he was compelled by considerable pressure and demand from his father's readers and publishers to produce something publishable as quickly as possible.\n\nIn October 1996, Christopher Tolkien commissioned illustrator Ted Nasmith to create full-page full-colour artwork for the first illustrated edition of \"The Silmarillion\". It was published in 1998, and followed in 2004 by a second edition featuring corrections and additional artwork by Nasmith.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, Christopher Tolkien published most of his father's Middle-earth writings as the 12-volume \"The History of Middle-earth\" series. In addition to the source material and earlier drafts of several portions of \"The Lord of the Rings\", these books greatly expand on the original material published in \"The Silmarillion\", and in many cases diverge from it. There is much that Tolkien intended to revise but only sketched out in notes, and some new texts surfaced after the publication of \"The Silmarillion\". These books also make it clear just how unfinished the later parts of \"The Silmarillion\" really were: some parts were never rewritten after the early versions in \"Lost Tales\".\n\n\"The Silmarillion\" is a complex work exhibiting the influence of many sources. A major influence was the Finnish epic \"Kalevala\", especially the tale of Kullervo. Influence from Greek mythology is also apparent. The island of Númenor, for example, recalls Atlantis. This, however, Tolkien later described in a letter to Christopher Bretherton as merely a \"curious chance\".\n\nGreek mythology also colours the Valar, who borrow many attributes from the Olympian gods. The Valar, like the Olympians, live in the world, but on a high mountain, separated from mortals; But the correspondences are only approximate; the Valar also contain elements of Norse mythology. Several of the Valar have characteristics resembling various Æsir, the gods of Asgard. Thor, for example, physically the strongest of the gods, can be seen both in Oromë, who fights the monsters of Melkor, and in Tulkas, the physically strongest of the Valar. Manwë, the head of the Valar, exhibits some similarities to Odin, the \"Allfather\". Tolkien also said that he saw the Maia Olórin (Gandalf) as an \"Odinic wanderer\".\n\nInfluence of the Bible and traditional Christian narrative are seen in \"The Silmarillion\" in the conflict between Melkor and Eru Ilúvatar, a parallel of the polarity of Lucifer and God. Further, \"The Silmarillion\" tells of the creation and fall of the Elves, as \"Genesis\" tells of the creation and fall of Man. As with all of Tolkien's works, \"The Silmarillion\" allows room for later Christian history, and one draft even has Finrod, a character in \"The Silmarillion\", speculating on the necessity of Eru's (God's) eventual Incarnation to save mankind.\n\nMedieval Christian cosmology shows its influence especially in the account of the creation of the universe as the manifestation of a sort of song sung by God with which the angels harmonize until the fallen angel introduces discord. St. Augustine's writings on music, as well as the extensive medieval tradition of the divine harmony—more familiar to us today in the notion of the \"music of the spheres\"—served as bases for this telling of creation.\n\nCeltic mythology show its influence in the exile of the Noldorin Elves, for example, that borrow elements from the story of Irish legends of the Tuatha Dé Danann. Welsh influence is seen in the Elvish language Sindarin, that Tolkien gave \"a linguistic character very like (though not identical with) British-Welsh ... because it seems to fit the rather 'Celtic' type of legends and stories told of its speakers\".\n\nAt the time of release, reviews of \"The Silmarillion\" were generally mixed to negative. \"The Silmarillion\" was criticized for being too serious, lacking the light-hearted moments that were found in \"The Lord of the Rings\" and especially \"The Hobbit\". \"Time\" magazine lamented that there was \"no single, unifying quest and, above all, no band of brothers for the reader to identify with\". Other criticisms included difficult-to-read archaic language and many difficult and hard-to-remember names.\n\nRobert M. Adams of \"The New York Review of Books\" called \"The Silmarillion\" \"an empty and pompous bore\", \"not a literary event of any magnitude\", and even claimed that the main reason for its \"enormous sales\" was the \"Tolkien cult\" created by the popularity of \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\", predicting that more people would buy \"The Silmarillion\" than would ever read it. The \"School Library Journal\" called it \"only a stillborn postscript\" to Tolkien's earlier works. Peter Conrad of the \"New Statesman\" even went so far as to say that \"Tolkien can't actually write\".\n\nNonetheless, a few reviewers praised the scope of Tolkien's creation. \"The New York Times Book Review\" acknowledged that \"what is finally most moving is … the eccentric heroism of Tolkien's attempt\". \"TIME\" described \"The Silmarillion\" as \"majestic, a work held so long and so powerfully in the writer's imagination that it overwhelms the reader\". The \"Horn Book Magazine\" even lauded the \"remarkable set of legends conceived with imaginative might and told in beautiful language\". John Calvin Batchelor, reviewing the book for \"The Village Voice\", lauded the book as a \"difficult but incontestable masterwork of fantasy\" and praised the character of Melkor, describing him as \"a stunning bad guy\" whose \"chief weapon against goodness is his ability to corrupt men by offering them trappings for their vanity\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

YFS also serves as a vehicle to promote networking opportunities and leadership development among its members to further strengthen the communities where these institutions are located. YFS is composed of individuals in their twenties, thirties and forties.\n\nAfrican Diasporan Institutions are cultural, historic, educational, and economic institutions and organizations that are located in cities around the world that have large populations of people African descent. These institutions include but are not limited to museums, historical societies, theatre companies, dance companies, libraries and archives and performing arts groups.\n\nYFS began as an auxiliary group at the African American Museum of Philadelphia (AAMP). While working as the educational coordinator at AAMP, Shantrelle P. Lewis witnessed a lack of young adult visitors. Following in the tradition of other arts and cultural organizations, Lewis developed a plan to attract a younger demographic that could inject a new energy into the museum. YFS held its inaugural event, Soul Simpatico, in October 2005, and within a year it had brought in 100 new members to AAMP.\n\nAs the organization grew, it became apparent that similar institutions in Philadelphia needed innovative ways to engage young adults looking for alternatives to the conventional nightlife scene of clubs and bars. In January 2007, YFS incorporated as a Pennsylvania non-profit organization and secured 501(c)3 status by June of the same year. Over the next two years, YFS partnered with various cultural organizations in Philadelphia, grew its membership base and held several successful events. YFS also started chapters in New Orleans and New York City, with plans to expand domestically and internationally.\n\n1) Institution Building: YFS will help to ensure the survival and growth of important institutions. Through the development of a young core of members, supporters and sponsors, YFS will assist in sustaining African Diasporan Institutions for future generations. Each YFS chapter will invite up to 7 institutions in its geographic area to become a partner institution. These institutions will receive direct support and benefits as a partner institution of the Young Friends Society.\n\n2) Cross-cultural association: Over the next decade, YFS will establish chapters in major cities around the African Diaspora. This will serve as a link between the various people and cultures that exist within the African World. It serves to educate people about the similarities and variations of people of African descent. Chapters will be established in the U.S., Caribbean, South America, Europe and the Continent of Africa.\n\n3) Individual Support: YFS serves as a major catalyst for leadership development and interaction amongst like-minded individuals who are passionate about achieving their own unique potential and developing a global society. Unlike other networking forums that tend to serve individuals from a narrow demographic, YFS will bridge positive young people from diverse socio-economic, political, cultural, intellectual and religious backgrounds to support culture. In the process, it will also provide support for its members and their respective endeavors.\n\n\n\n"}

The new theatre had a capacity of about 2,000 spectators and included a parterre with the lowest-priced tickets sold only to males who stood throughout the performances, an amphitheatre, and four rows of boxes. The Opéra used the theatre from 27 October 1781 until August 1794.\n\nThe theatre was destroyed by fire during the Paris Commune of 1871 and replaced in 1873 with a building designed by the architect Oscar de la Chardonnière (d. 1881), who enlisted the aid of the sculptor Jacques-Hyacinthe Chevalier (1825–1895) in the design of the new facade. The new interior was designed by H. Chevalier. With relatively brief interruptions, the theatre has been in continuous operation since. \n\n\nThe theatre's other productions have included the ballet \"Leda, the Swiss Milkmaid\" (1823) and works by Dany Boon, Charles-Gaspard Delestre-Poirson and Gaston Arman de Caillavet.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53665518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53665518", "title": "Women in Chinese literature", "text": "Women in Chinese literature\n\n\"Cai\", loosely translated as \"literary talent\", is an attribute describing profound lyricism, deep intellectuality and analytic skill. Although it was acknowledged that both women and men possessed \"cai\", the phrase \"nuren wucai bian shi de\" 女人無才便是德 (for women, lack of literary talent is a virtue) summarizes the dominant sentiment that the literary field was traditionally a domain for men. Despite this belief, works authored by women play an integral part throughout Chinese history. There were a number of women writers prior to the 20th century who were respected by the intelligentsia of their era, even if much of their work was considered less important than men's work in general. Female writers helped to bring forth themes such as romance, marriage, gender roles and the politics surrounding women.\n\nThe first women recorded in biography and bibliography were poets. The aesthetic nature of poetry was highly regarded, while fiction was viewed as an avenue taken because of a failed career or commercial venture. A marked increase in female literacy took place during the Late Imperial Era. One of the more notable poets of this time was Mao Xiuhui, a 16th-century poet that used the plight of her husband's failed attempt at gaining a position as civil servant to write a poem that draws parallels between the male and female as they suffer hardships in the political and domestic arenas respectively. Other notable female poets in Chinese history were Gao Zhixian, Xue Tao, and Li Qingzhao.\n\nThe beginning of the century marked a period of growing unrest for women as the feminist movement took hold. Women of this period were faced with the dilemma of protesting oppressive ideals stemming from Confucian ideology or remaining true to their family and maintaining peace and order. Literary discourse at the time was highly influenced by this social movement. Women writers of the time authored works reflecting the feminist sentiment and the issues that came with revolution. Eileen Chang, Lu Yin, Shi Pingmei and Ding Ling, were four of the most influential feminist writers of the time. In the 1920s and 1930s, Freudian psychoanalysis gained favor with Chinese feminists looking to study gender relationships, thus becoming a topic of many feminist writers throughout the early and mid portions of the 20th century.\n\nWhen Mao came to power in 1949, he addressed the issue of women's rights and tried to establish women's equality through the \"iron girls\" of national development ideal. Through this philosophy, long-standing practices such as foot binding, prostitution and trafficking of women were abolished. Women were given the opportunity to own land, divorce, and join the military and other employment fields. The establishment of this ideology, however, did not liberate women; instead, it undermined the feminine voice by forcing women to take a male-oriented stance on public and domestic policy. Literature authored during this time reflects the restrictive and masculine perspective of women writers during this period. This \"Mulanian\" style of writing submerged true feminine identity, rendering the female perspective neglected and hidden in the male dominated political and aesthetic arenas. There were some exceptions to this rule, such as Yuan Chiung-chiung, who wrote about women’s issues and how much women could accomplish without men.\n"}

The series is distributed as a mail order membership club. In addition some individual volumes are available for sale directly through the Readers Digest website. The series began with single annual volumes in 1982 and 1983, then expanded to bi-monthly editions for years 1984-1995, and is published approximately every six weeks. The series is still in print. Many of the editions are ornately illustrated and included specially commissioned artwork. Each volume includes a small paper pamphlet with a biography of the author.\n\nThere are many variations within the WBR series. The most common variations include cloth boards versus smooth boards, patterned end papers with ribbon bookmarks versus plain colored end papers without ribbon bookmarks, different colored covers but retaining the same embossed cover image, and books that have completely different cover art than other editions.\n\nOne example of cloth boards versus plain boards is \"Far From The Madding Crowd\". Both the cloth and the plain editions are the same color with the same artwork, only the material of the boards is different. Other examples include \"Moby Dick, Treasure Island, O Pioneers, The Sea Wolf,\" and \"Uncle Tom’s Cabin\".\n\nAn example of the variation of patterned end papers with ribbon bookmarks versus plain colored end papers without bookmarks is \"Silas Marner\". Both books have the same artwork on the outside cover, but on the inside one edition has plain white end papers and the other has marble patterned end papers and a colored ribbon bookmark. Other titles with this variation are \"Pride And Prejudice, The Call of the Wild/White Fang, The Scarlet Letter, The House of Seven Gables, The Last Of The Mohicans, A Tale Of Two Cities, Tess of the D’Urbervilles, A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur’s Court, Little Women, Jane Eyre, Great Expectations, Twice-Told Tales,\" and \"The Innocents Abroad.\"\n\nAn example of a title having different colored covers but retaining the same embossed artwork image is \"A Tale Of Two Cities\". Cover variations of \"A Tale of Two Cities\" include a blue cloth cover, a brown cloth cover, and a red cover. Other editions with this variation include \"The Innocents Abroad, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, A Tale of Two Cities, Tales of Suspense, Silas Marner, Wuthering Heights\" (old cover style), \"Ben Hur, The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer\", and \"The Return of Sherlock Holmes\".\n\n\"Tess of the D’Urbervilles\" is an example where in two editions the boards are the same color (gray) but the embossed parts of the cover and the faux quarter leather covering are different colors. The artwork and faux leather is red in one edition and blue in the other edition.\n\nSome books have been printed with completely different cover artwork from other editions. Examples include \"Barchester Towers, The Jungle Books, Captains Courageous, Beau Geste\", and \"Wuthering Heights\". For some books, such as \"The Jungle Books\" and \"Barchester Towers\", the UK edition was published with illustrations where the American version was not.\n\nA spelling variation in a book title occurs with \"A Journey to the Center of the Earth\". In the UK, the edition was published under the title \"A Journey to the Centre of the Earth\".\n\nIn the United States, the James Hilton titles (\"Lost Horizon, Good-bye Mr. Chips and Other Stories\") were printed in two separate volumes whereas in the UK edition, they were combined into one book.\n\nEach edition in the WBR series includes a sheet folded in half numbered with page numbers one through four with a synopsis of the history of how the book came to be published and a short biography of the author and perhaps some information about the artist in illustrated editions. \"On Our Selection/Our New Selection\" is different from the rest of the books because not only is the author biography insert included, but also a folder containing six 5.5\" x 8.5\" prints of artwork by artist Lionel Lindsay. The prints included are titled \"Judy Wasn’t Frightened Of Jew-Lizards\", \"Sarah Thought It A Fine Effect\", \"‘It’s A Lie!’ Dad roared\", \"Daniel Damascus Rudd, Sir!\", and \"Dad Come to See the Great Metropolis.\" These are illustrations found in the actual book. One print is not from the book. It is not given a title and depicts the father scratching his bare head riding a horse in the woods at a walk towards the lower right hand foreground.\n\nReader’s Digest also issued a book safe as part of the WBR series, \"Paradise Lost\" by John Milton. The outside of the book safe is designed to look like other editions in the series, but inside the safe are two separated compartments. The interior of the safe is lined with light gray velvet and is kept closed with velcro strips on the back of the cover and on the middle divider between the two compartments.\n\nVivat Direct Limited, t/a Reader's Digest, a publishing company in the UK that usually prints Reader's Digest Select Editions, has published World's Best Reading books starting in 2010: \"Kidnapped/Treasure Island\" (), \"Wuthering Heights\" (), \"Oliver Twist\", \"Pride & Prejudice\", \"A Study In Scarlet/The Hound Of The Baskervilles\"(), \"Moonstone\", \"Robinson Crusoe\", \"The War of the Worlds/The Time Machine\", \"Jo's Boys\", \"Three Men in a Boat/Three Men on the Bummel\", and \"Ivanhoe\" (). These editions were published with insert pages like the other World's Best Reading books with the World's Best Reading logo at the top of the first page just like the other inserts. However, the inserts have the initials WBR above the spelled out World's Best Reading on the insert pages and the WBR initials on the spine of the books. These books are different from the original World's Best Reading books because they are bound in cloth and do not have the faux quarter leather binding over the spine. They also have illustrations on the front and back covers, unlike the rest of the series which have illustrations on the front cover board only.\n\n"}
