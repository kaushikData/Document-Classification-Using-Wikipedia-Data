Over the years, this group of archivists originally known as the Film and Television Archives Advisory Committee (F/TAAC) expanded from a handful of participants to several hundred archivists from over 100 national, regional and local institutions. In 1990, the name of the group was changed to the Association of Moving Image Archivists. In 1991, AMIA voted to formalize as an individual-based member-based professional association, the only one of its kind in the moving image archival field. Although AMIA's office is based in the US, its membership is now drawn from across the world. Further information on the origins and history of AMIA can be found here.\n\nMembership is open to anyone who has an interest in the preservation of moving images and associated sound recordings: in practice, most of the membership are professional archivists (both public sector and commercial) and people working in associated professions, e.g. librarianship, the film and television industry or academics in related fields. AMIA offers both individual and institutional membership.\n\nAMIA is governed by a Board of Directors, which is elected by the membership on a two-year cycle, and chaired by a president. The Board oversees and ratifies the work of the sub-groups through which the work of the organization is undertaken. The last significant changes to the governing structure were undertaken in 2009, when the present structure of committees and task forces was introduced.\n\n\n\nAMIA is a volunteer based organization and projects rely on work done by its members in Committees and Task Forces. More information about AMIA's Committees can be found here.\n\n\nOne of the principal activities undertaken by AMIA is the annual conference, which takes place each fall at a different city in North America. Recent conferences have occurred in Austin, Texas, Seattle, Washington, Richmond, Virginia, Savannah, Georgia, and Portland, Oregon. For more information see here: http://www.amiaconference.com\n\nDedicated to presenting the latest technologies in audiovisual restoration and preservation. The Reel Thing brings together a unique line up of laboratory technicians, archivists, new media technologists and preservationists. The Reel Thing Technical Symposium is organized and coordinated by Grover Crisp and Michael Friend.\n\nSince 2008, The Reel Thing: Los Angeles has offered two days of presentations and screenings each August. In addition, a half day event is held in conjunction with the AMIA Annual Conference. For more information: http://www.the-reel-thing.org/\n\nDAS offers in-depth, real world information on an ever-advancing technology. Case studies offer a broad mix of institutions, providing a unique opportunity to compare approaches in different communities. This real-life approach brings together content creators, caretakers and vendors to address the realities with which we are all faced, what works in \"theory\", and what works in the real world.\nhttp://www.digitalassetsymposium.com\n\nAMIA's online continuing education series are intended to further education in the archival moving image profession, as well as to provide introduction to these topics to the broader libraries and archives community. http://www.amiaonline.org\n\nAMIA's Festival of the Archives celebrates the work done by media archives in their efforts to preserve history and cultural heritage. The festival offers attendees quality films that highlight preservation and restoration efforts a wide spectrum of archival materials - feature films, documentaries, animation, historical footage, and commercial video. The inaugural festival was held in December, 2012 in conjunction with the SIFF Cinema Uptown in Seattle, Washington.\n\nAMIA operates an E-mail discussion list, known as AMIA-L to facilitate professional communication within the field. Subscription is open to AMIA members and non-members, and is free of charge. Topics that frequently arise in online discussion include news stories and media coverage related to moving image archiving, technical issues, requests for information about specific films or archive footage for re-use in TV productions, copyright and media history in general. The AMIA-L generates approximately 10-15 postings a day. All AMIA-L postings are archived online and available for public access. AMIA also operates a member list-serv to which only its members may subscribe.\n\nDeveloped by AMIA's Access Committee, the DEEP FOCUS portal is an inclusive outreach tool designed to provide academics, archivists, artists, curators, educators, exhibitors, filmmakers, programmers, researchers and students with a user-friendly and centralized means of global discovery – interconnecting a disparate labyrinth of invaluable moving image catalogs, services, resources, websites and related information.\n\nDEEP FOCUS welcomes a diverse range of entries into the directory. If your institution or company collects or works with moving images and/or provides services related to the field, your entry is integral to the success of the portal. You can find DEEP FOCUS here\n\nThe AMIA Newsletter is published electronically four times per year. It provides up-to-date information about the association and its activities, as well as regular columns and features and resources of interest to moving image archivists.\n\n\"The Moving Image\" is a peer-reviewed academic journal that explores topics relevant to both the media archivist and the media scholar. The Moving Image deals with crucial issues surrounding the preservation, archiving, and restoration of film, video, and digital moving images. It is edited by Susan Ohmer and Don Crafton and published by University of Minnesota Press.\n\n\"The AMIA Global Supplier Directory\", is published electronically four times per year and available on the AMIA website. The Supplier Directory is intended as an international resource guide for anyone working with audiovisual media.\n\nThe training of moving image archivists is central to AMIA's role as a professional organization and essential to the long-term survival of our moving image heritage. To this end, in addition to workshops and symposia, AMIA offers annual scholarships for students in education and training programs geared to the profession. In addition, AMIA offers the Image Permanence Institute Internship in Preservation Research, offering a student of merit who is committed to the preservation of moving images the opportunity to acquire practical experience in preservation research.\n\nAMIA supports a number of public and professional programs to promote education and foster cooperation and communication among the individuals and organizations concerned with the acquisition, preservation, description, exhibition, and use of moving image materials.\n\nAs an international organization, AMIA offers two programs to encourage professional exchange and enhance professional development to professional archivists from the developing world. More information can be found here: http://www.amianet.org/programs-and-initiatives/list-of-programs\n\nThe Your Archive Deserves Advocacy! initiative offers three annual awards in an effort focused on promoting the people and stories behind archives as well as providing resources that support advocacy.\n\nCommunity Travel Grants were established to pay tribute to the work of AMIA members, and offer colleagues, friends and families a way to honor contributions to the moving image field. The Fund provides travel funding for the AMIA Annual Conference.\n\nAMIA provides workshops covering a range of archival activities. Workshops are offered primarily in conjunction with the annual conference, but AMIA also offers regional hands-on workshops when possible. Recent workshops have covered: digital programming basics; cataloging & metadata; safeguarding audio visual assets; archival film presentation for projectionists, a writers workshop, access copy production for archivists, copyright, and an annual Hackday! and Community Archiving Workshop.\n\nIn addition to the three key events listed, AMIA organizes a number of special screenings and workshops that celebrate the preservation and restoration work done by archivists worldwide.\n\nAs an NGO (non-governmental organization) AMIA has consultative status with UNESCO and has coordinated on international events and presented at UNESCO events - most recently at the Memory of the World Programme Conference in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nIn addition, AMIA is affiliated with, and undertakes joint activities with, a number of organizations and projects worldwide. As the current chair of the Coordinating Council of Audiovisual Archives Association, AMIA works with other international audiovisual archives associations to promote the work done by archivists and to influence the development of public policy on issues of importance to the preservation of our audiovisual heritage.\n\nOn October 27 each year AMIA members participate in and promote the World Day for Audiovisual Heritage. In 2006 at its 33rd session the General Conference of UNESCO declared 27 October as World Day for Audiovisual Heritage. It is a unique occasion to raise awareness of the importance of sounds and images as a source of history of the last 150 years and of the importance of preserving them and making them accessible to whoever is interested in their content.\n\nAMIA participation also includes the following: a founding member of NAANICA (North American Archival Network), a branch of ICA; a founding member of the United States Committee of the Blue Shield, a branch of International Committee of the Blue Shield; representation on the National Film Preservation Board; a member of the Digital Promise coalition; and maintains relationships with more than a dozen organizations with similar missions.\n\nAMIA Awards recognize outstanding professional achievement in and contributions to the field of moving image archiving.\n\n\nAMIA provides travel grants to its annual conference. These travel grants are awarded based on criteria including financial need, as well as how attendance at the conference will contribute to professional development.\n\n\n\n"}

All share a common function in that they are invoked to highlight positive aspects of the in-group by explicit auto-stereotyping or, alternatively, to identify the negative characteristics of out-groups. The explicit positive stereotyping of an in-group may often implicitly suggest negative characteristics of a rival out-group.\"\nIn \"blasons populaires\" nations are homogeneous and have national characteristics.\n\nItems such as ethnic jokes or blonde jokes are very common examples of blason populaire.\n\nThe Irish proverbial material is almost devoid of any national blasons populaires, with the possible exception of the multi-group international comparison. These comparisons are often manifested in epigrammatic form in European languages, with the most salient and representative stereotypical trait being attributed to the nations involved (what Billig (1995) refers to as ‘banal nationalism’). Enumerative structures, usually tri- or quadripartite formulas, are the favoured apparatus. The syntactic and semantic juxtaposition of negative traits for comparative purposes is then counter-balanced by the positive representation of one nation, usually in final position, most commonly the in-group that invokes the comparison. Below is a nineteenth-century German example (Reinsberg-Düringsfeld 1863, 5) in which there is no apparent in-group.\n\nIn Wallonia (Belgium) and Luxembourg, the concept of \"blason populaire\" refers to a demonym-like nickname of the inhabitants of a village or a city.\n\n\"Blasons populaire\" come from the traditional languages (Walloon, Luxembourgish). They are never translated in French, as opposed to the demonyms which exist in French and in Walloon, often in two different constructions.\n\nSome, which have lost their pejorative meaning, are now used to name restaurants, theater groups, communal houses, etc. They are also used in pseudonyms of writers in Walloon.\n\nThe inhabitants of all villages or cities in these regions have a \"blason populaire\" (in Picard language: \"surpitchet\").\n\nFor example, for the town of Amiens the blason is \"chés Maqueus d'gueugues d'Anmien\" ('the Eaters of Walnuts of Amiens'). In 1597, Spanish soldiers mounted a surprise attack. They were disguised as peasants and put walnuts at the doors of the town. The inhabitants were famished and opened the doors, following which the Spanish soldiers entered the city; with deadly consequences for the inhabitants.\n\n\n"}

The work was a highly successful popularization of Greek mythology for English-speaking readers. Carl J. Richard comments that it was \"one of the most popular books ever published in the United States and the standard work on classical mythology for nearly a century,\" until the release of classicist Edith Hamilton's 1942 \"Mythology: Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes\".\n\nThe book is a prose recounting of myths and stories from three eras: Greek and Roman mythology, King Arthur legends and medieval romances. Bulfinch intersperses the stories with his own commentary, and with quotations from writings by his contemporaries that refer to the story under discussion. This combination of classical elements and modern literature was novel for his time.\n\nBulfinch expressly intended his work for the general reader. In the preface to \"The Age of Fable\" he states \"Our work is not for the learned, nor for the theologian, nor for the philosopher, but for the reader of English literature, of either sex, who wishes to comprehend the allusions so frequently made by public speakers, lecturers, essayists, and poets, and those which occur in polite conversation.\"\n\nBulfinch originally published his work as three volumes: \"The Age of Fable, or Stories of Gods and Heroes\", published in 1855; \"The Age of Chivalry, or Legends of King Arthur\", published in 1858; and \"Legends of Charlemagne, or Romance of the Middle Ages,\" published in 1863. The original three volumes were later combined into a single volume titled \"Bulfinch's Mythology\", published in 1881. Now in the public domain, multiple editions of the combined work are still in print more than 150 years after the three books were published.\n\n"}

DanceAbility promotes contemporary dance performance that mixes able and disabled dancers in the same performances. This dance genre is often called \"inclusive dance\", \"MixedAbility\" or \"physically integrated dance\".\n\nAccording to the Mission Statement of DanceAbility International, \"The work of DanceAbility International helps decrease prejudice and misconceptions about diversity in the field of dance, and by extension in society\".\n\nDanceAbility trains its dancers using improvisation techniques, mainly Contact Improvisation. This is \"a forum in which able and disabled dancers learn to move together\". Alessi has described Contact Improvisation as a technique that evolved \n\nAlessi has said that he was greatly influenced in his career by the experience of growing up with family members with disabilities: \"I have three immediate relatives with disabilities—my mother was quadriplegic following a traffic accident when I was 7, my sister had polio, and my uncle had what I call 'unique mental capabilities'\". Alessi was also influenced by the dance cultures of the various inner cities he was exposed to while moving often as a child.\n\nDancers who have worked with DanceAbility include Alito Alessi, Emery Blackwell, Karen Nelson, Scott Smith, and Charlene Curtis. Alessi launched DanceAbility with Karen Nelson in 1987, after reading an article about Contact Improvisation in Contact Quarterly dance and improvisation journal. DanceAbility began as a project of the Joint Forces Dance Company, giving a workshop on Contact Improvisation. DanceAbility became an international project beginning with workshops in Germany in 1991; teachers of inclusive and contemporary dance from several countries participated in DanceAbility gatherings annually during the early 1990s in Eugene, Oregon.\n\nIn the early years of DanceAbility, the majority of inclusive dance teachers were self-taught. DanceAbility offered teacher certification in 1997. Teacher training remains one of its core projects. Teacher training is now given in several countries, including:\n\nFollowing a major donation in 2007 from Marisa De Leon, founder of a school for children with disabilities in Montevideo, Uruguay, DanceAbility International has expanded into Latin America.

Manzini asserts that everybody is endowed with the ability to design, though not everyone is a competent designer and fewer still become professional designers.

{"id": "6556775", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6556775", "title": "Ecstasy (philosophy)", "text": "Ecstasy (philosophy)\n\nEcstasy (from the Ancient Greek ἔκστασις \"ekstasis\", \"to be or stand outside oneself, a removal to elsewhere\" from \"ek-\" \"out,\" and \"stasis\" \"a stand, or a standoff of forces\") is a term used in Ancient Greek, Christian and Existential philosophy. The different traditions using the concept have radically different perspectives.\n\nAccording to Plotinus, ecstasy is the culmination of human possibility. He contrasted emanation (πρόοδος, \"prohodos\") from the One—on the one hand—with ecstasy or reversion (ἐπιστροφή, \"epistrophe\") back to the One—on the other.\n\nThis is a form of ecstasy described as the vision of, or union with, some otherworldly entity (see religious ecstasy)—a form of ecstasy that pertains to an individual trancelike experience of the sacred or of God.\n\nAmong the Christian mystics, Bernard of Clairvaux, Meister Eckhart and Teresa of Ávila had mystical experiences of ecstasy, or talked about ecstatic visions of God.\n\nThe term is currently used in philosophy usually to mean \"outside-itself\". One's consciousness, for example, is not self-enclosed, as one can be conscious of an Other person, who falls well outside one's own self. In a sense consciousness is usually, \"outside itself,\" in that its object (what it thinks about, or perceives) is not itself. This is in contrast to the term enstasis which means from \"standing-within-oneself\" which relates to contemplation from the perspective of a speculator.\n\nThis understanding of enstasis gives way to the example of the use of the \"ecstasy\" as that one can be \"outside of oneself\" with time. In temporalizing, each of the following: the past (the 'having-been'), the future (the 'not-yet') and the present (the 'making-present') are the \"outside of itself\" of each other. The term ecstasy () has been used in this sense by Martin Heidegger who, in his \"Being and Time\" of 1927, argued that our being-in-the-world is usually focused toward some person, task, or the past (see also existence and \"Dasein\"). Telling someone to \"remain in the present\" could then be self-contradictory, if the present only emerged as the \"outside itself\" of future possibilities (our projection; ') and past facts (our thrownness; ').\n\nEmmanuel Levinas disagreed with Heidegger's position regarding ecstasy and existential temporality from the perspective of the experience of insomnia. Levinas talked of the Other in terms of 'insomnia' and 'wakefulness'. He emphasized the absolute otherness of the Other and established a social relationship between the Other and one's self. Furthermore, he asserted that ecstasy, or exteriority toward the Other, forever remains beyond any attempt at full capture; this otherness is interminable or infinite. This \"infiniteness\" of the Other would allow Levinas to derive other aspects of philosophy as secondary to this ethic. Levinas writes:\nThe term 'ecstasy' is also used concomitantly by philosophers to refer to a heightened state of pleasure or area of consciousness that may have been ignored by other theorists; to sexual experiences with another person, or as a general state of intense emotional rapture. These may include epiphany, intense consciousness toward another, or extraordinary physical connections to others.\n\n"}
{"id": "50820349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50820349", "title": "Elisabeth Thuillier", "text": "Elisabeth Thuillier\n\nElisabeth Thuillier (fl. 1890s-1920s) was a French colourist who ran a workshop in Paris where her employees hand-coloured early films and photographic slides using her plans and colour choices. She is remembered especially for the work she did for the director Georges Méliès.\n\nThuillier had experience in colouring slides for magic lanterns, and in other kinds of photographic and colour work. Her workforce had started colouring film by 1897. This cinematic work was still new and it was given last place in the following description of her exhibit for the Paris \"Exposition Universelle\" in 1900. Its length reflects the importance of Thuillier's business.\n\n\"Colours and colouring. Raw materials for tinting. Negative and positive photographs, on paper, on glass, on silk, on leather, on celluloid parchment. Stereoscopic prints on glass, coloured slides. Photochromy and artistic colour photographs. Film colouring for cinematography.\"\n\nThe \"Exposition\" jury awarded her a bronze medal.\n\nThuillier hired more than 200 employees, all women, to handle the film commissions her workshop undertook. In a 1929 interview, she recollected spending her nights selecting colours and trying out samples. Thuillier described her colours for film as \"fine\" aniline dyes, creating transparent and luminous tones. These dyes were dissolved first in water and then in alcohol. Each colourist was assigned a single tone, tinting specific parts of each frame before passing the film on to the next worker, in assembly line fashion. Some areas to be coloured were so small that a paintbrush containing only a single horsehair was used.\n\nThuillier and her workers probably used four basic dyes: orange, a cyan-like blue-green, magenta, and bright yellow. These could be mixed to create other colours. The tones produced also changed depending the shade of grey of the film underneath. Some films used more than twenty distinct colours, and all the work was done by hand. The workshop was at 87 Rue du Bac, Paris.\n\nAccording to Thuillier's recollections, her studio typically produced about 60 coloured copies of each film they took on. For 300 metres of hand-coloured film, the cost was about 6 or 7 thousand francs per copy.\n\nThuillier handled all colouring work on Méliès' films from 1897 to 1912. Thuillier's work on Méliès's films was international; for example, the American distribution company Selig Polyscope negotiated with Méliès to have its prints shipped to France to be coloured by Thuillier's workers.\n\nHer business was also used by Pathé, but she called off an agreement to work exclusively for them when she realised she would have to share authority with a Mme. Florimond whose husband was a key employee there. Another customer was experimental film-maker Raoul Grimoin-Sanson.\n\nThe pioneering director Segundo de Chomón was not a client but was introduced to Thuillier's techniques of hand-colouring through his wife Julienne Mathieu. Mathieu (Mme. Chaumont or Chomón) had worked in the Thuillier workshop, as a supervisor according to some sources, as well as acting in silent movies. Chomón soon moved on to adding colour with stencils.\n\nThuillier's hand-painting proved to be a slow, expensive way of colouring reels of film, and the world of cinema moved towards using stencils instead of freehand colouring; this was more efficient for multiple copies. The last client for Thuillier's colouring techniques was Georges Dufayel, whose impressive department store \"Grands Magasins Dufayel\" housed a cinema and other attractions. In her 1929 interview, Thuillier expressed regrets about the disappearance of her craft.\n\nIn December 1929, she was invited to a gala given in Méliès' honour at Salle Pleyel. Several films were shown, including \"A Trip to the Moon\". For this event, \"extremely delicate\" colour restoration work was undertaken by two of Thuillier's \"pupils\", according to \"Cinéa\" magazine. Since the original negatives had been destroyed, the women removed the colour from old positive copies of the films, made new negatives, then new positives, and re-coloured those. (Thuillier remarked to the press that if she had had sufficient time, she would have done the work herself.) Méliès introduced her in his speech at the gala as an \"eminent artist\" who did her work with a \"remarkable talent\". The audience applauded and called \"bravo\".\n\nLittle is known about Thuillier's non-professional life. On her business letterheads she was Mme. B. Thuillier, and was described as a widow around 1900. In the 1920s she withdrew from Paris to \"the provinces\".\n\n"}
{"id": "10055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10055", "title": "Etiology", "text": "Etiology\n\nEtiology (; alternatively aetiology or ætiology) is the study of causation, or origination. The word is derived from the Greek , \"aitiología\", \"giving a reason for\" (, \"aitía\", \"cause\"; and , \"-logía\"). More completely, etiology is the study of the causes, origins, or reasons behind the way that things are, or the way they function, or it can refer to the causes themselves. The word is commonly used in medicine, (where it is a branch of medicine studying causes of disease) and in philosophy, but also in physics, psychology, government, geography, spatial analysis, theology, and biology, in reference to the causes or origins of various phenomena.\n\nIn the past, when many physical phenomena were not well understood or when histories were not recorded, myths often arose to provide etiologies. Thus, an etiological myth, or origin myth, is a myth that has arisen, been told over time or written to explain the origins of various social or natural phenomena. For example, Virgil's Aenead is a national myth written to explain and glorify the origins of the Roman Empire. In theology, many religions have creation myths explaining the origins of the world or its relationship to believers.\n\nIn medicine, the etiology of an illness or condition refers to the frequent studies to determine one or more factors that come together to cause the illness. Relatedly, when disease is widespread, epidemiological studies investigate what associated factors, such as location, sex, exposure to chemicals, and many others, make a population more or less likely to have an illness, condition, or disease, thus helping determine its etiology. Sometimes determining etiology is an imprecise process. In the past, the etiology of a common sailor's disease, scurvy was long unknown. When large, ocean-going ships were built, sailors began to put to sea for long periods of time, and often lacked fresh fruit and vegetables. Without knowing the precise cause, Captain James Cook suspected scurvy was caused by the lack of vegetables in the diet. Based on his suspicion, he forced his crew to eat sauerkraut, a cabbage preparation, every day, and based upon the positive outcomes, he inferred that it prevented scurvy, even though he did not know precisely why. It took about another two hundred years to discover the precise etiology: the lack of vitamin C in a sailor's diet.\n\nAn etiological myth, or origin myth, is a myth intended to explain the origins of cult practices, natural phenomena, proper names and the like. For example, the name Delphi and its associated deity, \"Apollon Delphinios\", are explained in the Homeric Hymn which tells of how Apollo, in the shape of a dolphin ('), propelled Cretans over the seas to make them his priests. While Delphi is actually related to the word ' (\"womb\"), many etiological myths are similarly based on folk etymology (the term \"Amazon\", for example). In the \"Aeneid\" (published circa 17 BC), Virgil claims the descent of Augustus Caesar's Julian clan from the hero Aeneas through his son Ascanius, also called Iulus. The story of Prometheus' sacrifice trick at Mecone in Hesiod's \"Theogony\" relates how Prometheus tricked Zeus into choosing the bones and fat of the first sacrificial animal rather than the meat to justify why, after a sacrifice, the Greeks offered the bones wrapped in fat to the gods while keeping the meat for themselves. In Ovid's \"Pyramus and Thisbe\", the origin of the color of mulberries is explained, as the white berries become stained red from the blood gushing forth from their double suicide.\n\n"}

He is the founder and artistic director of Theatro Technis in London, England, which was established in 1957.\n\nGeorge Eugeniou was born in Limassol, Cyprus. He came to London in 1950 to study theatre with the support of his eldest sister, Loula Ionnides, and her family.\n\nHe trained at Morley College, where he met Frank Drew, who gave him free lessons in diction and voice. With Drew's help, Eugeniou received a scholarship at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art, where he won a Spotlight and a Webber Cup awards for his acting abilities.\n\nIn 1954 he joined Dundee Repertory Theatre company in Scotland as assistant stage manager, while also performing small parts. Then, he returned to London and joined a Cypriot amateur group under the auspices of The Cypriot Brotherhood with Paul Stasino, Anna Koutayiar and Theo Moreas. One year later he joined Sir Donald Wolfit's company which was performing the play \"The Strong are Lonely\", touring all the major cities of England ending at Piccadilly Theatre first and then at the Haymarket Theatre. In 1956, he joined Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop in Stratford East with several productions, including \"The Quare Fellow\" by Brendan Behan.\n\nIn 1957, Eugeniou founded Theatro Technis, which was neither commercial nor subsidised, with the help of a group of actors, workers and students, including Andreas Markou, Stelios Kyriacou, Medea O'Brennon, Andy Lysandrou and Spyros Kyprianou. Theatro Technis can be defined as a \"radical and total\" theatre as Eugeniou's philosophy is to break barriers between nationalities, religions, genders, sexual orientations, classes, ages and languages.\n\nEugeniou has totally dedicated himself to Theatro Technis, abandoning his career as a mainstream actor, apart from a few movies in the 1950s and '60s. As Theatro Technis' artistic director he devised, directed and acted in numerous productions, often inspired by Cypriot or Greek artists and events. He was among the first to produce plays written or acted by black personalities such as Mark Heath, Harcourt Nichols, and Peter Blackman. Eugeniou has helped hundreds of student from all over London and abroad, proposing work-experiences or internships, free of charge. His passion for alternative theatre remains a common thread in his work as he always believes that the creative spirit is not for sale.\n\nStill marked by his Cypriot accent, Eugeniou staged a production of Aristophanes' famous satires, as \"Women in Parliament\", in June 2013.\n\nIn 1967, he initiated the Cyprus Week, an annual festival to highlight the Cypriot culture and way of life in the United Kingdom and to create a greater awareness of the struggle of Cyprus against British colonialism and Turkish invasion of Cyprus. He is also one of the founders of the National Federation of Cypriots in England, an umbrella organisation of more than one hundred Cypriot organisations.\n\nIn 1968, he created the first Cypriot Advisory Service in the United Kingdoms, which has helped thousands of Cypriot migrants and refugees receive welfare benefits, education, or housing. He also instigated and helped build the Cyprus Villages Housing in partnership with St Pancras Housing Association in the late 1980s. This \"from life to art to life\" philosophy is a cornerstone of his work.\n\nIn 1969, George Eugeniou married Maroulla Sekkides, who became an actress with Theatro Technis. They have a son Aris, who is also dedicated to the theatre.\n\n"}
{"id": "738235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=738235", "title": "Grisaille", "text": "Grisaille\n\nA grisaille ( or ; 'grey') is a painting executed entirely in shades of grey or of another neutral greyish colour. It is particularly used in large decorative schemes in imitation of sculpture. Many grisailles include a slightly wider colour range, like the Andrea del Sarto fresco illustrated. Paintings executed in brown are referred to as brunaille, and paintings executed in green are called verdaille.\n\nA grisaille may be executed for its own sake, as underpainting for an oil painting (in preparation for glazing layers of colour over it), or as a model for an engraver to work from. \"Rubens and his school sometimes use monochrome techniques in sketching compositions for engravers.\" Full colouring of a subject makes many more demands of an artist, and working in grisaille was often chosen as being quicker and cheaper, although the effect was sometimes deliberately chosen for aesthetic reasons. Grisaille paintings resemble the drawings, normally in monochrome, that artists from the Renaissance on were trained to produce; like drawings they can also betray the hand of a less talented assistant more easily than a fully coloured painting.\n\nGiotto used grisaille in the lower registers of his frescoes in the Scrovegni Chapel, and Robert Campin, Jan van Eyck and their successors painted grisaille figures on the outsides of the wings of triptychs, including the Ghent Altarpiece. Originally these were the sides on display for most of the time, as the doors were normally kept closed except on feast days or at the (paid) request of tourists. However today these images are often invisible in museums when the tryptych is displayed open and flat against a wall. In these cases imitation of sculpture was intended; sculpture was still more expensive than a painting even by a top master.\n\nIlluminated manuscripts had often been produced in pen and wash with a very limited colour range, and many artists such as Jean Pucelle and Matthew Paris specialised in such work, which had been especially common in England since Anglo-Saxon times. Renaissance artists such as Mantegna and Polidoro da Caravaggio often used grisaille as a classicising effect, either in imitation of the effect of a classical sculptured relief, or of Roman painting.\n\nIn the Low Countries a continuous tradition of grisaille paintings can be traced from Early Netherlandish painting to Martin Heemskerck, Pieter Brueghel the Elder (\"Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery\") and Hendrik Goltzius, and through the copious output of Adriaen van de Venne, to the circle of Rembrandt, and Jan van Goyen.\n\nThe ceiling frescoes of the Sistine Chapel have portions of the design in grisaille, as does the lower part of the great staircase decoration by Antonio Verrio at Hampton Court.\n\nGrisaille, while less widespread in the 20th Century, continues as an artistic technique. Pablo Picasso's painting \"Guernica\" is one contemporary example.\n\nHugo Bastidas is a contemporary American painter known for black and white paintings that imitate the effect of grisaille and often resemble black and white photographs. Bastidas’ paintings frequently reference architecture, water, vegetation and art history, and reflect his concern about the human condition, globalization, and their effect on the Earth’s well-being. After returning to New York from a Fulbright Fellowship in his native Ecuador in the early 1990s, Bastidas began using a restricted color palette of black and white. His medium- and large-scale paintings allude to black-and-white photography, and feature contrasting zones of high and low detail. By making thousands of marks with a size No. 1 hog's bristle brush on linen primed with rabbit-skin glue, Bastidas achieves a high level of image definition. He also works in digital photography, which informs his subject matter without rendering a photo-realistic effect.\n\nWith the 20th century's emphasis on direct (\"alla prima\") painting, the grisaille technique lost favour with artists of the period. This historic method is still incorporated into the curriculum of some private ateliers.\n\nThe term is also applied to monochrome painting in other media such as enamels, where an effect similar to a relief in silver may be intended. It is common in stained glass, where the need for sections in different colours was thereby greatly reduced. Portions of a window may be done in grisaille — using, for example, silver stain or vitreous paint — while other sections are done in coloured glass.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40064569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40064569", "title": "Halsted Church", "text": "Halsted Church\n\nHalsted Church stands in the little village of Halsted some 6 km east of Nakskov on the Danish island of Lolland. Dating from the second half of the 12th century, the church has a Romanesque chancel and nave, a large burial chapel from 1636 and a tower from 1877. The church was closely associated with Halsted Priory, which has not survived.\n\nThe granite church is first mentioned in 1177. It is therefore older than Halsted Kloster, the Benedictine priory with which it was associated from the 13th century until 1536. The church was dedicated to St Samson of Constantinople. In 1177, the Crown's clerical appointment rights were transferred by King Valdemar to Ringsted Abbey, which continued to have responsibility over Halsted Priory. At the time of the Reformation, ownership returned to the Crown, which retained it until 1719 when it was transferred to ]]Jens Juel-Vind]] in exchange for Juellinge on Zealand. It was subsequently owned by members of the Juel-Vind family. After the barony was dissolved in 1921, the church came under ownership of the adjoining main building, named Halsted Kloster. In 1987, Mogens-Krag-Juel-Vind-Frijs returned ownership to the church itself.\n\nThe church was originally a Romanesque building with a nave, chancel, apse and possibly a tower. Remains of the chancel and nave survive in the masonry of today's structure. When it became the priory church at the end of the 13th century, the chancel was extended to the east, its three-sided gable replacing the former apse. The church formed the northern wing of a four-winged priory of which nothing remains today. In 1510, the Lübeckers burnt down the abbey, probably also destroying the church's Romanesque tower. During the 16th century the church was extended towards the west. A low tower was built at the west end and was rebuilt in the 1870s. In 1636, Borkvard Rud obtained rights to build the north chapel as a burial chapel for the owners of nearly Sæbyholm. The church was fully restored from 1868 to 1877.\n\nVaults were introduced at the beginning of the 16th century, with three cross-vaults in the nave, two star-shaped vaults in the chancel and a five-sectioned vault at the end of the chancel. The late 15th-century altarpiece is a Gothic triptych with a scene of the crucifixion in the centre and saints and apostles on the two wings. The auricular chancel screen from 1671 with the 11 apostles and Christ's baptism was probably crafted by Henrik Werner. A Baroque altarpiece which crowned the altar from 1750 to 1877, when it was replaced by the 15th-century work, can now be seen on the north wall of the chancel. The auricular pulpit (1636), displaying representations of Faith, Hope and Charity as well as the arms of Prince Christian and Princess Magdalene Sibylle, is the work of Jørgen Ringnis. The font from c. 1750 is probably from the same workshop as the Baroque altarpiece.\n\n"}

She had a long affair with the journalist-turned-politician Henry Labouchère, later marrying him.\n\nHodson was born at Upper Marsh in St Mary's parish, Westminster, London. She was the eldest daughter of George Alfred Hodson (1822–1869), an Irish-born comedian, singer and innkeeper, and Henrietta Elizabeth Noel, an actress and singer. Her two sisters, Kate (later Mrs Charles Henry Fenton, but known on stage as Kate Gordon) and Sylvia (Mrs J. Stripling Blythe), were also actresses. Hodson's cousin was the theatre producer George Musgrove.\n\nHodson made her first professional stage appearance at the Theatre Royal, Glasgow, in 1858. In 1860, she and Henry Irving worked together in Manchester in \"The Spy, or, A Government Appointment\". She joined J. H. Chute's Bath and Bristol companies in 1861 and built a reputation as a popular soubrette and burlesque actress. An 1883 \"New York Times\" article calls her \"the cleverest Aladdin in H. J. Byron's piece I remember to have seen.\" In 1863, at the Theatre Royal in Bath, England, she played the role of Oberon in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" under the management of Madge Robertson (later Mrs Kendal), who also starred in the play, and Ellen Terry. There she also played the title role in the burlesque \"Endymion\". In 1864, she married Richard Walter Pigeon, a solicitor and widower from Bristol, England, who had several children, and left the stage. They had one child, George Walter Noel Pigeon, born in 1865. Hodson left her husband, amid rumours of abuse, and returned to acting, using her maiden name.\n\nIn 1866, Hodson made her London début at the Prince of Wales's Theatre under the management of Marie Wilton (later Lady Bancroft) and H. J. Byron, as Prometheus in Byron's Christmas show, \"Pandora's Box, or, The Young Spark and the Old Flame\". In 1867, with Charles Wyndham, Irving, J. L. Toole, Lionel Brough and Terry, Hodson joined a new company at Queen's Theatre, Long Acre, and opened with Charles Reade's \"The Double Marriage\", in which Hodson played the small role of Jacintha. About 1868, she moved in with Henry Labouchère, a member of parliament and later a journalist and playwright, who was one of the founders of Queen's Theatre, but they could not marry until years later when her first husband died. Other roles that season included Arabella Fotheringay in \"The First Night\", Lucy in Byron's \"Dearer than Life\" and in the same author's \"The Lancashire Lass\", and the title role in \"Oliver Twist\". In addition to roles in other Byron pieces, she acted at Queen's in various extravaganzas and burlesques, including \"La Vivandière\" by W. S. Gilbert, \"The Stranger\" by Robert Reece, \"The Gnome King\" by William Brough, the successful \"The Turn of the Tide\" by F. C. Burnand, and \"Twixt Axe and Crown\" by Tom Taylor. She stayed with that company for three years.\n\nIn 1870, she managed the Royalty Theatre for a season, playing in many of its pieces. She starred in Reece's \"Whittington Junior and his Sensation Cat\" and other burlesques. Back at Queen's Theatre, she played Ariel in \"The Tempest\" and Imogen in \"Cymbeline\". In 1871 she began to manage the Royalty again, starring there in \"The Honeymoon\" as Juliana. She instituted the innovation of using a hidden orchestra below the stage. Also in 1871, she played Lady Amaranth in John O'Keefe's \"Wild Oats\", followed by such roles as Nydia the blind girl in John Oxenford's version of Lord Lytton's \"The Last Days of Pompeii\" (1872), Dick Wastrell in \"Old London\", adapted from \"Les Chevaliers du Brouillard\" (1873; a French dramatisation of \"Jack Sheppard\"), and Jane Theobald in Gilbert's \"Ought We to Visit Her?\" (1874). During that play, she quarrelled with Gilbert, threatened him with legal action when he described the quarrel to others, and demanded a written apology, which she then made public.\n\nIn 1875 in Liverpool, Hodson created the title character of Clytie in Joseph Hatton's dramatisation of his novel of the same name. That year she also created the lead role of Eliza Smith in Arthur Sullivan's \"The Zoo\" in London. She repeated the role at the Olympic Theatre in 1876. In 1877, she became the leading actress with the Haymarket Theatre, then managed by John Baldwin Buckstone. There she played Cynisca in a revival of Gilbert's \"Pygmalion and Galatea\". Gilbert did not wish to cast her, but under her contract with the Haymarket, she insisted on taking the role and again threatened legal action. The next Gilbert piece at the theatre was a revival of \"The Palace of Truth\", and Hodson insisted on playing a different role than the one Gilbert and Buckstone wished. Buckstone gave the actress notice that she would not be needed the next season. Hodson blamed Gilbert and consulted her solicitor. When he told her that she had no case, she instead complained of Gilbert's \"persecution\" of her and criticised his demanding directing methods in a pamphlet-letter circulated among theatre professionals. Gilbert responded quickly with an open letter, setting forth a series of letters and references that showed inaccuracies in Hodson's statements. This was published on 27 May 1877 in \"The Era\", along with Hodson's rebuttal. In the end, she did not appear in \"The Palace of Truth\".\n\nIn 1878, Hodson returned to Queen's Theatre as Dolores, Countess Rysoor, in Labouchère's \"Fatherland\", an adaptation of Victorien Sardou's \"Patrie!\". She retired from acting soon afterwards and lived in comfort at Alexander Pope's Villa at Cross Deep Twickenham, near London, with Labouchère. However, in 1881, she tutored and mentored Lillie Langtry in her early stage work, accompanying Langtry to America the next year, although the two soon fell out, and Hodson returned to England.\n\nIn 1887, she finally married Labouchère, with whom she already had a daughter, Mary Dorothea (1884–1944). In 1903 Hodson and her husband moved to Villa Christina, near Florence, Italy. She died there at the age of 69. Her daughter, Mary Dorothea, married Carlo Emanuele Starabba, 2nd Marchese di Rudinì (the son of Antonio Starabba, Marchese di Rudinì, prime minister of Italy) in 1903, then the Prince Gyalma Odescalchi De Szerem, and finally Don Eugenio Ruspoli. Hodson and Labouchère are buried at the cemetery of San Miniato al Monte, Florence.\n\n (1908) London: Hutchinson & Co.; \n\n"}

{"id": "707063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=707063", "title": "Ikat", "text": "Ikat\n\nIkat is a dyeing technique used to pattern textiles that employs resist dyeing on the yarns prior to dyeing and weaving the fabric.\n\nIn ikat the resist is formed by binding individual yarns or bundles of yarns with a tight wrapping applied in the desired pattern (\"ikat\" means \"to bind\" in the Indonesian language). The yarns are then dyed. The bindings may then be altered to create a new pattern and the yarns dyed again with another colour. This process may be repeated multiple times to produce elaborate, multicolored patterns. When the dyeing is finished all the bindings are removed and the yarns are woven into cloth. In other resist-dyeing techniques such as tie-dye and batik the resist is applied to the woven cloth, whereas in ikat the resist is applied to the yarns before they are woven into cloth. Because the surface design is created in the yarns rather than on the finished cloth, in ikat both fabric faces are patterned.\n\nA characteristic of ikat textiles is an apparent \"blurriness\" to the design. The blurriness is a result of the extreme difficulty the weaver has lining up the dyed yarns so that the pattern comes out perfectly in the finished cloth. The blurriness can be reduced by using finer yarns or by the skill of the craftsperson. Ikats with little blurriness, multiple colours and complicated patterns are more difficult to create and therefore often more expensive. However, the blurriness that is so characteristic of ikat is often prized by textile collectors.\n\nIkat is produced in many traditional textile centres around the world, from India to Central Asia, Southeast Asia, Japan (where it is called kasuri), Africa and Latin America. Double ikats—in which both the warp and weft yarns are tied and dyed before being woven into a single textile—are relatively rare because of the intensive skilled labour required to produce them. They are produced in Okinawa islands of Japan, the village of Tenganan in Indonesia, and the villages of Puttapaka and Bhoodan Pochampally in Telangana in India. In fact, many other parts of India have their indigenous Ikat weaving techniques. Orissa’s Sambalpuri Ikat is quite different from the sharp Ikat patterns, woven in Patan of Gujarat. The latter, known as Patan Patola, is one of the rarest forms of double Ikat, which takes a lot of time and effort in dyeing and weaving. A different form of Patola ikat is made in Rajkot, Gujarat. Telia Rumal made in Andhra, Pasapalli from Odisha and Puttapaka from Telangana are other Indian Ikats. \n\nIn warp ikat it is only the warp yarns that are dyed using the ikat technique. The weft yarns are dyed a solid colour. The ikat pattern is clearly visible in the warp yarns wound onto the loom even before the weft is woven in. Warp ikat is, amongst others, produced in Indonesia; more specifically in Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Sumatra by respectively the Dayaks, Torajans and Bataks.\n\nIn weft ikat it is the weaving or weft yarn that carries the dyed patterns. Therefore, the pattern only appears as the weaving proceeds. Weft ikats are much slower to weave than warp ikat because the weft yarns must be carefully adjusted after each passing of the shuttle to maintain the clarity of the design.\n\nDouble Ikat is a technique in which both warp and the weft are resist-dyed prior to weaving. Obviously it is the most difficult to make and the most expensive. Double ikat is only produced in three countries: India, Japan and Indonesia. The double ikat made in Patan, Gujarat in India is the most complicated. Called \"patola,\" it is made using fine silk yarns and many colours. It may be patterned with a small motif that is repeated many times across the length of a six-meter sari. Sometimes the Patan double ikat is pictorial with no repeats across its length. That is, each small design element in each colour was individually tied in the warp and weft yarns. It's an extraordinary achievement in the textile arts. These much sought after textiles were traded by the Dutch East Indies company for exclusive spice trading rights with the sultanates of Indonesia. The double ikat woven in the small Bali Aga village, Tenganan in east Bali in Indonesia reflects the influence of these prized textiles. Some of the Tenganan double ikat motifs are taken directly from the patola tradition. In India double ikat is also woven in Puttapaka, Nalgonda District and is called \"Puttapaka Saree.\" In Japan, double ikat is woven in the Okinawa islands where it is called \"tate-yoko gasuri\".\n\nPasapalli Ikat is one of the Ikkat saree and Pasapalli ikat saree made in Odisha. The word Pasapalli comes from 'Pasa' which means a board game with four clear parts (much like Ludo). Each pasapalli ikat saree or material - which is made with the same technique as the Sambalpuri Ikat - has some or the other form of this chequered design. \n\n\"Ikat\" is an Indonesian language word, which depending on context, can be the nouns: cord, thread, knot and the finished \"ikat\" fabric as well as the verbs \"to tie\" or \"to bind\". It has a direct etymological relation to Javanese language of the same word. Thus, the name of the finished \"ikat\" woven fabric originates from the \"tali\" (threads, ropes) being \"ikat\" (tied, bound, knotted) before they are being put in \"celupan\" (dyed by way of dipping), then \"berjalin\" (woven, intertwined) resulting in a \"berjalin ikat\"- reduced to \"ikat\".\n\nThe introduction of the term \"ikat\" into European language is attributed to Rouffaer. \"Ikat\" is now a generic English loanword used to describe the process and the cloth itself regardless of where the fabric was produced or how it is patterned.\n\nIn Indonesian the plural of \"ikat\" remains \"ikat\". However, in English a suffix plural 's' is commonly added, as in \"ikats.\" This is true in other some other languages. All are correct.\n\nIkat is a weaving style common to many world cultures. It is probably one of the oldest forms of textile decoration. However, it is most prevalent in Indonesia, India and Japan. In Central and South America, \"ikat\" is still common in Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala and Mexico.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Silk Road desert oases of Bukhara, Samarkand, Hotan and Kashgar (in what is now Uzbekistan and Xinjiang in Central Asia) were famous for their fine silk Uzbek/Uyghur ikat.\n\nIndia, Japan, Indonesia and many other Southeast Asian nations including Cambodia, Myanmar, Philippines and Thailand have weaving cultures with long histories of ikat production.\n\nDouble ikat weaving is still found in India, Japan and Indonesia. In Indonesia, it is still woven in Bali, Java, Kalimantan or Borneo and Sumatra.\nAnother country that has been weaving Ikat is Iran.\nThe name of this technique in yazd is Daraee.Daraee means wealth,the reason of this naming is that in wedding ceremonies, There were these fabrics in the bride’s dowry, and the people who had bought these fabrics were rich.\n\nAs textiles do not last well through history, scholars have so far been unable to determine where the technique of ikat originated. Nevertheless, some parts of Asia demonstrates strong ikat traditions which suggest its possible origin; they are Maritime Southeast Asia, Indian subcontinent and Central Asia. However, it probably developed in several different locations independently, since ikat was known to be produced in several pre-Columbian Central and South American cultures.\n\nThe term \"ikat\" has Indonesian origin, and it was introduced into European textile vocabulary back in early 20th century, when the Dutch scholars begin to study the rich textile traditions of East Indies archipelago (today Indonesia).\n\nUyghurs call it atlas (in IPA [ɛtlɛs]) and use it only for woman's clothing. The historical record indicates that there were 27 types of atlas during Qing occupation. Now there are only four types of Uyghur atlas remaining: Qara-atlas (Darayi, black ikat used for older women's clothing), Khoja'e-atlas (yellow, blue, purple ikat used for married women), Qizil-atlas (red ikat used for girls) and Yarkant-atlas (Khan-atlas). Yarkant-atlas has more diverse styles; during Yarkant Khanate (16th century), there ten different styles of Yarkant-atlas.\n\nIkat created by dyeing the warp are simpler to make than either weft ikat or double ikat. First the yarns--cotton, silk, wool or other fibres—are wound onto a frame. Then they are tied into bundles. The bundles may be covered with wax, as in batik. (However, in making batik, the craftsperson applies the resist to the finished cloth rather than to the yarns to be woven.) The warp yarns are then wrapped tightly with thread or some other dye-resistant material to prevent unwanted dye permeation. The procedure is repeated, depending on the number of colours required to complete the design. Multiple coloration is common, requiring multiple rounds of tying and dyeing. The newly dyed and thoroughly washed bundles are wound onto the loom to produce the warp (longitudinal yarns). Warp threads are adjusted for the desired alignment for precise motifs.\n\nSome ikat traditions, such as Central Asia's, embrace a blurred aesthetic in the design. Other traditions favour a more precise and more difficult to achieve refinement in the placement of the ikat yarns. South American and Indonesian ikat are known for a high degree of warp alignment. Weavers must adjust the warp repeatedly to maintain pattern alignment.\n\nPatterns result from a combination of the warp dye and the weft thread colour. Some warp ikat traditions are designed with vertical-axis symmetry or have a \"mirror-image\" running along their long centre line. That is, whatever pattern or design is woven on the right is duplicated on the left in reverse order about a central warp thread group. Patterns can be created in the vertical, horizontal or diagonal.\n\nWeft ikat uses resist-dyeing for the weft yarns. The movement of the weft yarns in the weaving process means precisely delineated patterns are more difficult to weave. The weft yarn must be adjusted after each passing of the shuttle to preserve the pattern.\n\nNevertheless, highly skilled artisans can produce precise weft ikat. Japanese weavers produce very accurate indigo and white weft ikat with small scale motifs in cotton. Weavers in Odisha, India have replicated fine Urdu script in weft ikat. In Thailand, weavers make silk sarongs depicting birds and complex geometrical designs in seven colour weft ikat.\n\nIn some precise weft ikat traditions (Gujarat, India), two artisans weave the cloth: one passes the shuttle and the other adjusts the way the yarn lies in the shed.\n\nAs the weft is commonly a continuous strand, aberrations or variation in coloration are cumulative. Some weft ikat traditions incorporate this affect into their aesthetic. Patterns become transformed by the weaving process into irregular and erratic designs. Guatemalan ikat is well-noted for its beautiful \"blurs.\"\n\nDouble ikat is created by resist-dyeing both the warp and weft prior to weaving. Some sources use the term double ikat only when the warp and weft patterning overlap to form common, identical motifs. If they do not, the result is referred to as compound ikat.\n\nThis form of weaving requires the most skill for precise patterns to be woven and is considered the premiere form of ikat. The amount of labour and skill required also make it the most expensive, and many poor quality cloths flood the tourist markets. Indian and Indonesian examples typify highly precise double ikat. Especially prized are the double ikats woven in silk known in India as \"patola\" (singular: \"patolu\"). These are from Gujarat (Cambay). During the colonial era, Dutch merchants used patola as prestigious trade cloths during the peak of the spice trade.\nIn Indonesia double ikat is only woven in the Bali Aga village of Tenganan. These cloths have high spiritual significance. In Tenganan they are still worn for specific ceremonies. Outside Tenganan, geringsing are treasured as they are purported to have magical powers.\n\nThe double ikat of Japan is woven in the Okinawa islands and is called \"tate-yoko gasuri\".\n\nPochampally Sari, a variety from a small village in Nalgonda district, Andhra Pradesh, India is known for silk saris woven in the double Ikat.\n\nThe Puttapaka Saree is made in Puttapaka village, Samsthan Narayanpuram mandal in Nalgonda district, India. It is known for its unique style of silk saris. The symmetric design is over 200 years old. The Ikat is warp-based. The Puttapaka Saree is a double ikat.\n\nBefore the weaving is done, a manual winding of yarn, called Asu, needs to be performed. This process takes up to 5 hours per sari and is usually done by the womenfolk, who suffer physical strain through constantly moving their hands back and forth over 9000 times for each sari. In 1999, a young weaver C Mallesham developed a machine which automated Asu, thus developing a technological solution for a decades-old unsolved problem.\n\nOshima ikat is a uniquely Japanese ikat. In Oshima, the warp and weft threads are both used as warp to weave stiff fabric, upon which the thread for the ikat weaving is spot-dyed. Then the mats are unravelled and the dyed thread is woven into oshima cloth.\n\nThe Oshima process is duplicated in Java and Bali, and is reserved for ruling royalty, notably \"Klungkung\" and \"Ubud\": most especially the \"dodot\" cloth semi-cummerbund of Javanese court attire.\n\nThe Cambodian ikat is a weft ikat woven of silk on a multi-shaft loom with an uneven twill weave, which results in the weft threads showing more prominently on the front of the fabric than the back.\n\nBy the 19th century, Cambodian ikat was considered among the finest textiles of the world. When the King of Thailand came to the US in 1856, he brought as a gift for President Franklin Pierce fine Cambodian ikat cloth. The most intricately patterned of the Cambodian fabrics are the \"sampot hol\"—skirts worn by the women—and the \"pidans\"—wall hangings used to decorate the pagoda or the home for special ceremonies.\n\nUnfortunately, Cambodian culture suffered massive disruption and destruction during the mid-20th century Indochina wars but most especially during the Khmer Rouge regime. Most weavers were killed and the whole art of Cambodian ikat was in danger of disappearing.\n\nKikuo Morimoto is a prominent pioneer in re-introducing ikat to Cambodia. In 1995, he moved from Japan and located one or two elderly weavers and Khmer Rouge survivors who knew the art and have taught it to a new generation.\n\nIn Thailand, the local weft ikat type of woven cloth is known as Matmi (also spelled 'Mudmee' or 'Mudmi').\nTraditional Mudmi cloth was woven for daily use among the nobility. Other uses included ceremonial costumes. Warp ikat in cotton is also produced by the Karen and Lawa tribal peoples in northern Thailand.\n\nThis type of cloth is the favourite silk item woven by ethnic Khmer people living in southern Isaan, mainly in Surin, Sisaket and Buriram.\n\nIn Iran, Ikat which is called Darayee has been carried out in different areas and now in Yazd there are some workshops to produce it. it is said that this kind of cloth has been used in the dowry, as a bride's property in the old days. in popular belief, there is a quote that people who bought this type of cloth were wealthy.\nIkat patterns are common among the Andes peoples, and native people of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela. The Mapuche shawl or poncho of the Huaso cowboys of Chile is perhaps the item best known in the West. Wool and \"cabuya\" fibre are the most commonly used. \n\nThe Mexican rebozos can be made from silk, wool or cotton and are frequently ikat dyed. These shawls are seen as a part of the Mexican national identity and most women own at least one.\n\nLatin American \"ikat\" (Jaspe, as it is known to Maya weavers) textiles are commonly woven on a back-strap loom. Pre-dyed warp threads are a common item in traditional markets- saving the weaver much mess, expense, time and labour.

Isfahani carpets are known for their high quality. The most famous workshop in Isfahan is \"Seirafian\".\n\nIsfahan rugs are knotted on either silk or cotton foundations, with up to 1.000.000 Persian knots/sqm(there have been pieces created by Seyrafian master workshop with higher knot count), using exceptionally good quality (referred to as kork wool in Iran) wool for the pile, which is normally clipped quite low. In the beginning of the renewal of Isfahan as the carpet center of high quality rugs, most rugs used traditional motifs inspired by the architectural motifs and tiles that decorated the historical buildings of this great city. Designers were further inspired by the poets of Persia (Rumi, Hafez, Attar), nature, and religious spiritual intimations that are deeply ingrained in the culture. In contemporary items the palette has become more pastel, utilizing the technical perfection and artistic flair of this \"City of Art\". Both Classical and contemporary Isfahan’s are extremely attractive, and the subduing of the palette, particularly the elimination of strong reds, makes them more compatible with Western decorative schemes.\n\nA range of traditional designs are still used including allover Shah Abbas, Vase, Tree of Life and Pictorial schemes but by far the most popular composition is based on a circular central medallion (Derived from the famous mosque of Shah Lutf Allah in Isfahan) set against an elegantly sculpted field decorated with intricately purling vine palmette and flor motifs.\n\nAntique/ semi-Antique rugs of Isfahan are more colorful and richer in tone than that of Nain, a nearby city renowned for its exceptional handmade rugs. Antique Isfahans are quite sought after since production had been almost completely been halted since 1722, during which the Afghan invasion occurred. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century that it was firmly reestablished.\n\nShah Abbas the Great was an inspired King of the Safavid dynasty, and in consequence not only moved the capital of Persia to Isfahan from Qazvin but also started an artistic renaissance within the capital of his court. Under his vision and guidance carpet weaving in Isfahan flourished. However the Afghan invasion dealt a serious blow to this industry which it never recovered from until the beginning of the 20th century. Some early pieces created in the last century can be found which consist of 500.000 knots-1.000.000 knots/m2, however these are rare and few in number. World war I brought a change in “modern” Isfahan which was the center of weaving for the fashion industry of Iran. The change of fashion in the world also influenced Iran, causing Isfahan to lose its lucrative fabric industry. However, the shrewd businessman of Isfahan decided to utilize the fine quality wool in fabrics and Aba’s into high quality Persian rugs which again reestablished Isfahan as a base for one of the finest and most beautiful carpets of Iran.\n\nSome Isfahani rugs became known in Western Europe as \"Polish rugs\"or \"Polonese rugs\". This name refers to carpets woven with silk, golden and silver threads in Persia during the 16th-18th centuries and exported to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. They were commissioned by wealthy Polish noblemen and decorated with their coats of arms. Some of them were later resold to West European buyers who were often convinced of their Polish origin, hence their name.\n\n"}

This date was defined with Arabic ligature on the facade of the Friday Mosque, stating the year 126 according to Islamic calendar as the establishment year. Just in this period the construction of new religious buildings – mosques – was begun in the territory of Azerbaijan. Historical appearance of ancient Islamic architectural monuments was related to Arabs’ governance and spreading of Islam in the territory of Azerbaijan. Friday Mosque of Shamakhi is considered the first mosque in the Caucasus after cathedral Friday Mosque of Derbent, which was constructed in 734. \n\nThe construction date of the mosque is dated from the governance period of Caliphate’s vicar in the Caucasus and Dagestan, Arabic commander Maslam ibn Abd-al Melik, brother of Umayyad caliph Valil I (705-715), by whom Shamakhi was chosen as the residence. In these years Arab governors, strengthening towers of this ancient city with the rich cultural heritage, began the construction of new structures in its territory. Arabs attached the great importance to Shamakhi, which is visible from the great architectural appearance of Friday Mosque.\n\nConsiderable demolitions and damages of Friday Mosque during the battles and earthquakes were the reason of restorative reconstructions of the mosque’s building. According to information of Imadeddin Isfahani - a chronicler of Seljuq’s epoch, beginning from 1123, Shirvanshah rulers resorted to Seljuq’s sultan Mahmud (1118-1131), for defense from forays of Georgians. The chronicle says that “the assailants demolished the mosque, knocked down the minaret, plundered in the city” at that time in Shamakhi. \n\nThe first construction of Friday Mosque was begun at the end of the 12th century and was related to the considerable damage of Friday Mosque’s building suffered from partial forays and was conditioned by the strengthening of Shirvanshakh’s power during the reign of the ruler Manuchehr III, by whom were built new constructions and strengthened the city walls. Historian-archeologist Jiddi, relying on historical sources and books about construction reported about a sobriquet “The Great Khagan”, how Manuchehr II was called due his great merits. At that time, the eminent Persian poet Khaqani, native of Shamakhi, wrote that “the glory of his city overshadowed the glory of Bukhara”. Archeological excavations, held in 1970, in the territory of the mosque confirmed the considerable constructional and architectural changes, dated from that epoch. Considerable amount of madrasah, cell-huts and graves were found during the archeological excavations. \n\nThe second construction of the mosque was made in the 17th century, during the reign of Safavid Dynasty. Evliya Çelebi-Turkish scientist-traveler visiting Shamakhi in 1656, said that Friday Mosque is the largest religious construction of the city among others. In his work Evliya Chelebi reports about some structural changes of Friday Mosque during the Safavids’ epoch. \n\nThe third reconstruction of the mosque was made in 1860 by province architect Hajibababeyov after the great damage of the building by the earthquake in 1859. This reconstruction was made on the basis of draft images of Russian artist Grigory Gagarin. \n\nThe fourth reconstruction was begun after the strongest earthquake in 1902, which was demolished and damaged a lot of buildings of Shamakhi. For complete reconstruction of the mosque were gathered donations by philanthropists and was created a special committee. Primarily, the reconstruction of the mosque was charged to the eminent Azerbaijani architect of that time-Ziverbey Ahmadbeyov, a native of Shamakhi city. One of the conditions of the architect was preservation of external of the mosque, but the committee didn’t agree with that, which became the reason of the architect’s discharge from the subsequent works of the mosque’s reconstruction. Continuation of the work in the mosque was offered to the architect Józef Plośko. Variation of the project, presented by Józef Plośko in 1909, provided considerable change of façade and external look of the mosque. The project was based on the foundation of elder plan and results of the uncompleted construction, but there appeared orderly flanking minarets on it and open balconies with light pavilions, symmetric-axial composition of the mosques with pair minarets was completed by a great central cupola. Such planning was used in the 15th century in construction of Tabriz school of architecture for the first time and also adopted architectural features of Shirvanshahs’ Palace ensemble in Baku. Construction of the mosque based on Józef Plośko’s project was charged to D.Sadykhbeyov, but such important elements as central cupola, side minarets, gallery, portal and central stair platform were deleted from the project during the work because of the deficiency of financial resources.\n\nIn 1918, Friday Mosque, which was not fully constructed, again was suffered from fire, made by armed units of Armenian party “Dashnaktsutiun” under the guidance of Stepan Lalayan, whose attack to Shamakhi began nearly simultaneously with bloody events in Baku. According to petition of Shamakhi people living in Baku to general Thompson – Commander-in-Chief of the Union Army “the city was completely destroyed, and then-burned, none of the mosques could escape destruction”. As a result of the fire, 1800 residents-women, children, old men, who were forcibly driven away to the mosque were burned alive by dashnaks. Rare manuscripts and books were also destroyed. Today, everybody can see tracks of fire on the walls of the mosque.\n\nIn December 2009, the order about the restoration of the state historical-architectural monument Friday mosque of Shamakhi was written by Ilham Aliyev-the President of Azerbaijan.\n\nThe Friday Mosque Complex always distinguished with its volume and silhouette among cultic and civil monuments of Azerbaijan because of the correlation with earlier monuments of Islamic architecture, keeping its composition centre. The only extant sketch of Friday Mosque was made in 1847, by Russian architect G.Gagarin from life, who portrayed architectural monuments and other cities of Azerbaijan in his pictures. Just these pictures make an idea about the external look and internal ornamentation of old Friday Mosque. The ancient internal planning organization of the mosque has been kept till now, in spite of the multiple reconstructions. Three-hall structure of the mosque, three-section internal area covered with central and not great side cupolas are seen on G.Gagarin’s pictures. The central pointed dome, pillars of side sections and oblong interior of the main hall of warship makes Friday Mosque similar with Friday Mosque of Derbent. Plan of the mosque is rectangular, sizes of the mosque’s are 46 meters length and 28 meters width, the mosque has a large warship hall, divided into three separated quadratic sections related with each other by open and large apertures. Each prt of the mosque has separate mihrab and aperture for entrance. Friday Mosque is called three-hall mosque because of a such plan. Such kind of planning reminds of planning organization of the well-known Great mosque of Umayyads in Damask, which was built in 708. Friday Mosque of the 8th century in Aghsu, which was destroyed during the fire in 1918, was differed with analogical planning. The frequent constructions enabled to keep initial internal outlines and foundation of the mosque in whole, though the internal ornamentation and some details of external façade suffered definite modifications. Archeological researches showed that, plan of the building remained invariable, in spite of the multiple reconstructions. \n\nMost considerable modifications on the architectural structure of the mosque were made on Józef Plośko’s project. The architect added elements of the Eastern architecture, taking traditions of Islamic architecture as a principle of that time to his project. Planning structure of Friday Mosque should be supplemented with dynamic content and special picturesqueness in Józef Plośko’s interpretation. Eliminating side abutments of the warship hall, the architect tried to create most solid and monumental interior. For creating the same size of three halls of the mosque, the architect with specific artistic-plastic expressiveness conceived non-traditional construction, the metallic carcasses of which were produced in Warsaw for Shirvan zone of the cupola. For strengthening significance of the composition, Plośko developed high multiple-window lodgement to which the central cupola leaned on. There should be four decorative minarets around it. Ornamental decorations, shebeke (window frameworks with gashed patterns) and decorative pillars were also intended to be in the project.\n"}

Some actors are typecast as leads, but most play the lead in some performances and supporting or character roles in others.\n\nSometimes there is more than one significant leading role in a dramatic piece, and the actors are said to play \"co-leads\"; a large supporting role may be considered a \"secondary lead\". Award nominations for acting often reflect such ambiguities. Thus, sometimes two actors in the same performance piece are nominated for Best Actor or Best Actress -- categories traditionally reserved for leads. For example, in 1935 Clark Gable, Charles Laughton and Franchot Tone were each nominated for the Best Actor Academy Award for \"Mutiny on the Bounty\". There can even be controversy over whether a particular performance should be nominated in the Best Actor/Actress or Best Supporting Actor/Actress category.\n\nA title role is often but not necessarily the lead.

He states that government's involvement in defining arbitrary limits on the duration, scope, etc. of intellectual property in order to \"promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts\" is inherently problematic, since \"By what standard do you judge that research expenditures are 'too much,' 'too little,' or just about enough?\" He argues that intellectual property laws can actually hinder innovation, since competitors can be indefinitely discouraged from further research expenditures in the general area covered by the patent because the courts may hold their improvements as infringements on the previous patent, and the patent holder is discouraged from engaging in further research in this field because the privilege discourages his improvement of his invention for the entire period of the patent, with the assurance that no competitor can trespass on his domain.\n\nMorris and Linda Tannehill propose that ideas in the form of inventions could be registered in a privately owned \"data bank\"; the inventor could then buy insurance against the theft and unauthorized commercial use of the invention, and the insurance company would guarantee to not only compensate the inventor for any losses suffered due to such infringement but to stop such unauthorized use.\n\nOpponents to intellectual property rights include Wendy McElroy, Tom G. Palmer, Henri Lepage, Boudewijn Bouckaert, Jeffrey Tucker, and N. Stephan Kinsella. Kinsella points out in \"Against Intellectual Property\" that patents may be inefficient since they divert resources from research and development to patent filing and lawsuits. He notices that theoretical research can not be patented as easily as practical research and thus theoretical research is relatively underfunded. Moreover, he argues that property rights can only apply to resources that are scarce, which intellectual property is not. Kinsella also claims that the only way that intellectual property rights can be implemented is by limiting others' physical property rights.\n\nDavid D. Friedman takes a neutral stance on intellectual property, claiming \"there are good arguments on both sides of that question\".\n\nRoderick T. Long argues that the concept of intellectual property is not libertarian. He holds that prohibiting people from using, reproducing, and trading copyrighted material is an infringement of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, and that since information exists in people's minds and other people's property, one cannot own information without owning other people. Claiming that authors and publishers will continue to produce absent copyright protection, he cites the fact that hundreds of thousands of articles are uploaded onto the Internet by their authors every day, available to anyone in the world for free and that nearly all works written before the 20th century are in the public domain, yet pre-1900 works are still published and sold.\n\nBenjamin Tucker, opposing intellectual property, writes, \"...the patent monopoly...consists in protecting inventors...against competition for a period long enough to extort from the people a reward enormously in excess of the labor measure of their services,in other words, in giving certain people a right of property for a term of years in laws and facts of Nature, and the power to exact tribute from others for the use of this natural wealth, which should be open to all.\"\n\nAyn Rand, founder of Objectivism, supported copyrights and patents, noting in \"\":\n\nShe held that patent should be granted for limited terms only: \n\nAnarchists such as Lysander Spooner and J.

However, there is tantalizing mention of the titles of such works, such as \"Karvand\". There is the possibility that Iranian elites were familiar with Greek literature and philosophy. Greek culture was cultivated during the philhellenic Arsacid dynasty, so much so that \"in the courts of Arsacid kings Greek plays were performed in the original language\". Even as late as the Sassanid Empire, Greek philosophers took refuge in Iran in the academy at Gundeshapur. However, it remains a matter for speculation how much influence Greek ideas had on the literature of the period before Islam.\n\nThe oldest surviving work of Persian literary criticism is the \"Muqaddamah-i Shāhnāmah-i Abū Manṣūrī\" (Introduction to Abū Manṣūr's \"Shāhnāmah\"). \"This work deals with the myths and legends of the \"Shāhnāmah\" and is considered the oldest surviving example of Persian prose.\" \n\nDuring much of this period, commentary on poetry would take the form of either slander or excessive praise, that is \"sophistry or exaggeration of trivial errors in the poetry of rivals.\"\nThe sarcastic remarks occasionally encountered in the poetry books... relating to rival poets are slanderous in nature and not genuinely critical. Conversely, when poets wrote favorably about each other, they merely exchanged flattery. Shahīd and Rūdakī admired one another and Rūdakī was praised by Kasā'ī, Daqīqī, Farrukhī, and ʿUnsurī; ʿUnsurī and Ghazā'irī, however, belittled each other's works.\n\nDuring the Seljuq period, with the growing influence of Arabic literature a more technical style of literary criticism (\"naqd-i fannī\") became predominant.\n\n\"Tarjumān al-Balāghah\" by Muḥammad b. ʿUmar Rādūyānī \"illustrates seventy-three types of rhetorical figures with Persian poems cited as examples in each case.\" Rashīd al-Dīn Muḥammad b. Muḥammad Vaṭvāṭ in his \"Ḥadā'iq al-Siḥr\" gives \"different definitions of rhetorical figures.\" Kaykāvūs b. Iskandar in his \"Qābūs'nāmah\" says this of prose style: \"In Arabic letters rhymed prose is a sign of distinction, whereas it is disapproved in letters written in Persian, and much better omitted. Let all the language you use be elevated, metaphorical, mellifluous and terse.\"\n\nOne of the most well-known classical works on literary criticism is \"Chahār Maqālah\" (\"Four Essays\") by Nizāmī ʿArūzī Samarqandī, in which the author treats the \"definition, essence, and purpose\" of poetry.\n\nDuring this period, the compilation of \"tazkirāt\" (anthologies sg. \"tazkirah\") produced \"criticism of taste (\"naqd-i zawqī\")\" which really represented a return to the \"ad hominem\" attacks and rival name-calling which characterize much of what passes for literary criticism during most of Iranian history. \"As with earlier periods, the practitioners of the criticism of taste belittled their predecessors in order to aggrandize themselves.\" Muḥammad ʿAwfī wrote two of the most notable: \"Jawāmiʿ al-hikāyat\" and \"Lubāb al-albāb\". Dawlatshāh Samarqandī's \"Tazkirāt al-shuʿarā\" \"can be called the first true anthology of Persian poetry.\" Some other \"tazkirāt\" of this period:\n\n\nSome critics went against this trend. Shams-i Qays Rāzī wrote \"al-Muʿjam fī maʿāyir ashʿār al-ʿajam\" which is \"the most comprehensive text of its kind to that date\" and treats prosodic technique and terminology and poetic feet, rhyme, and criticism in two volumes. \n\nThe poetry of the Safavid period is characteristic of what has since come to be known as \"sabk-i hindī\" (\"Indian style,\" also called \"Ṣafavī\" or \"Iṣfahānī\" after the dynasty which nurtured it and its capital, respectively), marked by innovative and complex metaphor (as opposed to the simpler \"ʿIrāqī\" or \"Khurāsānī\" style of the earliest Persian poetry). Then, too, the primary literary critical works were \"tazkirāt\", most prominently \"Tuḥfah-i Sāmī\" by Sām Mīrzā.\n\nA sharp rebuke to the \"sabk-i hindī\" occurred in the eighteenth century when some poets urged a return to the \"purer, simpler, and more lucid diction\" of earlier poets. One of the more prominent members of this group was Luṭf ʿAlī b. Āqā Khān Āzar Baygdilī, who compiled \"Ātashkadah\". This reaction against Indian-style Persian poetry has continued to the present century, when even Western scholars such as E.G. Browne have dismissed this tradition. Riza Qulī Khān Hidāyat (born 1800) in the introduction to his \"Majmaʿ al-Fuṣaḥā\", writes the following:\nUnder the Turkomans and the Safavids, reprehensible styles appeared ... and since there were not binding rules for lyrics, the poets, following their sick natures and distorted tastes, began to write confused, vain, and nonsensical poems. They placed in their poetry insipid meanings instead of inspired truths, ugly contents ... instead of fine rhetorical devices and attractive innovations.\n\nThe Qajar period is not known for any contributions to the \"classical\" tradition of literary criticism in Iran, but rather for the appearance of liberal social critics who are better treated in the context of the Iranian reform movement.\n\nStarting in the nineteenth century, criticism of literature became bound up with criticism of all the \"entrenched political and economic institutions\". This was due largely to the encroachment of European political and cultural influence which undermined the traditional society of Iran.<reference needed>\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, Iranians for the first time felt the impact of the industrializing European powers. Russia incurred the first serious defeat against Iran by a European power during the Russo-Persian War. The Treaty of Gulistan ceded large parts of Azerbaijan and Georgia to the Russian Empire. In Central Asia, Russia and Great Britain were waging a contest for influence and concessions. British interests in India compelled them to create the buffer state of Afghanistan. Iranian ambitions to recapture Herat, were constantly frustrated during the Anglo-Persian War and the city has remained a part of Afghanistan ever since. At the same time, European sea-traffic had bypassed the ancient Silk Road, which had been the backbone of Iran's economy since time immemorial. Traditional craftsmen could no longer compete with a flood of cheap, industrially produced goods from Europe. The nineteenth century was a traumatic period for much of the world as European imperial powers stretched their possessions over the globe, and Iran was no exception.\n\nIn the midst of all these setbacks, many Iranians awoke to an urgent sense of the need for reform. More and more Iranians left Iran to study in Europe. Translations into Persian of Western works began to appear with greater frequency. Even the Qajar princes themselves, who were most threatened by these changes, attempted stillborn reforms of their own (usually military or industrial) in an attempt to \"catch up\" with the West. It is therefore no surprise that the criticism of literature at this time assumed a strongly social-reformist dimension.\n\nThe intellectual underpinning of the new criticism was possible because of the rise of rational, critical thought. The European thinkers most popular to the growing class of reformist intellectuals were those of the European Enlightenment, such as René Descartes and Isaac Newton \n\nThe Iranian reform movement can be seen in the context of the earlier movements in Europe and North America whereby \"philosophers and thinkers arose ... who, through their criticism, challenged deeply seated superstition, ignorance and injustice.\" An element common to these is the imagery of light (cf. Persian: \"rawshan'fikr\" \"enlightened\") and dark:\nThe movement these thinkers set in motion stood as a bulwark in defense of knowledge, learning, and reform, and, through the promotion of understanding and wisdom, sought to dispel the \"darkness\" of superstition and ignorance.[emphasis added]\n\nIn the late Qajar period, from the late 19th century until the Iranian Constitutional Revolution, several themes are common among the new literary critics.\n\n\nFor this generation of thinkers, Iranian backwardness was the result of its culture's decay. They sought to place attention on the shortcomings of Iran's literature, because they thought that by revitalizing it they could lay the ground for the revitalization of their society. \"Such an approach, of course, ignores the fact that illiteracy and ignorance are the outward manifestations of a poor, backward, medieval economy.\"\n\nConsidered the \"founder of modern literary criticism in Iran,\" Mīrzā Fatḥ ʿAlī Ākhūnd'zādah used literary criticism as \"the vehicle for his reformist impulse.\" Ākhund'zādah, because of his unfamiliarity with the Persian language and its prosody, made technical errors in some of his criticism, and was just as verbose and incoherent as those he attacked. However, he was the first critic in the modern tradition. He emphasized \"realistic content in prose and poetry\" and attacked the \"decadence of Persian literature — a literature that failed to address the social needs of its time.\" \n\nHe published many works on literary criticism:\n\nKirmānī emphasized \"that it is meaning, not the mode of expression, that exerts the real influence on the reader,\" and thus discouraged the \"destruction of the natural clarity of language ... by means of complicated metaphors, difficult words, long sentences, and complex expressions.\" \n\n\nMīrzā Malkum Khān's Armenian background and Christian religion may have played a part in the simplicity of his Persian prose. In his most important literary-critical work, \"Firqah-i Kaj'bīnān\" (\"the squint-eyed sect\"), Malkum Khān lampooned the language of various classes of society and encouraged a more concise prose style.\n\n\nṬālibūf, along with the earlier critics mentioned above, recognized the didactic use of literature to instruct people. He also helped to establish a simpler prose style (\"sādah'nivīsī\") \"especially in scientific prose in Iran.\"\n\n\nIn his \"Sīyāhat'nāmah-i Ibrāhīm Bayk\", Marāghah'ī stressed love of country. \"He found Persian literature preoccupied with love and lyricism and negligent of social and national issues.\" Marāghah'ī put his simple prose style into use.\n\n"}

The fountain is designated as a contributing property to the Schenley Farms Historic District.\n\nThe work of art comprises two major figures: a reclining Pan, the Greek god of shepherds, and above him a female singer playing a lyre. From crevices along the fountain's rim four turtles spew water into the basin. An inscription on the pedestal reads, \"A Song of Nature, Pan the Earth God Answers to the Harmony and Magic Tones Sung to the Lyre by Sweet Humanity.\" The basin of the fountain is 15 feet high, above which the figures rise another 15 feet.\n\nThe fountain honors Mary Schenley. In 1889, after intensive lobbying by Edward Manning Bigelow, director of parks for the City of Pittsburgh, Schenley donated the land for the park named in her honor. Upon her death, Pittsburgh City Council sponsored a national competition for the memorial. The judges selected this design by Brenner, who is famous today for his design of the Lincoln cent, which is still in circulation.\n\nIn June 2008, restoration efforts were begun that include repairs, cleaning, plumbing, paving, and landscaping. A gift from the Benter Foundation will provide lighting for the fountain and plaza.\n\n"}

He writes that mind is a basic aspect of nature, and that any philosophy of nature that cannot account for it is fundamentally misguided. He argues that the standard physico-chemical reductionist account of the emergence of life – that it emerged from a series of accidents, acted upon by the mechanism of natural selection – flies in the face of common sense.\n\nNagel's position is that principles of an entirely different kind may account for the emergence of life, and in particular conscious life, and that those principles may be teleological, rather than materialist or mechanistic. He stresses that his argument is not a religious one (he is an atheist), and that it is not based on the theory of intelligent design (ID), though he also writes that ID proponents such as Michael Behe, Stephen C. Meyer, and David Berlinski do not deserve the scorn with which their ideas have been met by the overwhelming majority of the scientific establishment.\n\nThe book generated significant criticism, including from Steven Pinker, Daniel Dennett and Elliott Sober. Michael Chorost wrote that Nagel raised valid criticisms but did not sufficiently engage with the large – though not dominant – body of scientific literature related to natural teleology. Chorost also suggests the book would have received less criticism had Nagel not endorsed criticisms raised by proponents of intelligent design, despite Nagel's not having endorsed intelligent design as a solution.\n\nPhysicist Sean M. Carroll negatively reviewed the book concluding \"he advocates overthrowing things that are precisely defined, extremely robust, and impressively well-tested (the known laws of physics, natural selection) on the basis of ideas that are rather vague and much less well-supported (a conviction that consciousness can’t be explained physically, a demand for intelligibility, moral realism).\"\n\n"}
{"id": "34025698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34025698", "title": "Motif (folkloristics)", "text": "Motif (folkloristics)\n\nMotif is a word used by folklorists who analyze, interpret, and describe the traditional elements found in the lore of particular folk groups and compare the folklore of various regions and cultures of the world based on these motif patterns. Ultimately, folklorists identify motifs in folklore to interpret where, how, and why these motifs are used, so they can understand the values, customs, and ways of life of unique cultures.\n\nIn cultural anthropology and folkloristics, the meaning of \"motif\" encompasses the meanings of \"motif\" used in the areas of music, literary criticism, visual arts, and textile arts because folklorists study motifs (i.e., recurring elements) in each of these areas, motifs that create recognizable patterns in folklore and folk-art traditions.\n\nFolklorists also use \"motif\" to refer to the recognizable and consistently repeated story elements (e.g., common characters, objects, actions, and events) that are used in the traditional plot structures, or tale types, of many stories and folktales. These motifs, which Dr. Margaret Read Macdonald calls “each small part of a tale,” were indexed in 1932 by Stith Thompson and published as the \"Motif-Index of Folk-Literature\".\n\nThompson built upon the research of Antti Aarne (and the tale type index he created) when he compiled, classified, and numbered the traditional motifs of the mostly European folktale types in Aarne’s index and then cross referenced those motifs with Aarne’s tale types (Dundes). Folklorist Alan Dundes explains that Stith Thompson’s “six-volume \"Motif-Index of Folk-Literature\" and the Aarne-Thompson tale type index constitute two of the most valuable tools in the professional folklorist's arsenal of aids for analysis”.\n\nBelow is a sample of the index's headings.\n\nIn the book \"The Folktale\", folklorist Stith Thompson explains how motifs and tale types are interrelated as he describes the role of one type of character found in many folk narratives, the helper:\n\nThe same is true for any character or other motif. In fact, Thompson also explains that a single motif may be found in numerous folktales “from all parts of the earth” (383).\n\nThompson’s explanations show that the sequential order of motifs is also an important factor for folklorists to consider as they interpret individual motifs found in various folktale types used internationally.\n\nMany of the source texts in Thompson's \"Motif-Index\" are no longer currently in print. Dr. Margaret Read McDonald's \"Storytellers Sourcebook\" refers readers to stories in current books that also use motifs of folk literature. For example, Disney’s \"Cinderella\" contains many of the same traditional motifs that Read MacDonald points out in her preface to \"The Storyteller’s Sourcebook\" (e.g., Glass slipper, Cruel Stepmother, and Three-fold flight from ball) (x).\n\nMany folklorists have produced extensive motif and tale-type indices for culture areas not covered by Thompson, or covered only to a limited extent. For surveys, see\n\nThe following are some important examples:\n\n\nAccording to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (\"OED\"), folkloristic use of \"motif\" is not summed up in the definition for literary criticism (“Motif,” def. 3a), but deserves its own separate sense of this definition (“Motif,” def. 3b). Similarly, the compound word \"motif index\" is used in cultural anthropology to denote “an index of standard motifs, esp. those found in folk tales” (\"OED\", “Motif Index,” def. C2).\n\n"}
{"id": "55993307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55993307", "title": "Native American drama", "text": "Native American drama\n\nEarly Native American culture was rich with ceremonies, rituals and storytelling. These ceremonies had theatrical elements, but whether or not these traditions are early forms of modern-day theatre or are independent cultural practices is not clear. According to Henry Schafer, “A variety of rituals and ceremonies could be considered early forms of theatre….Others see this interpretation as a devaluation of sacred rituals as simply a pre-form of secular theatre.” One of the first practitioners of Native Theatre was a Mohawk poet named Emily Pauline Johnson, who performed dramatic readings of her poems in the late nineteenth century. Other early contributors to the Native Canadian Theatre scene included a non-native named Anthony Walsh who directed the “Can-Oos-Sez Skay-loo Drama Group,” from 1934 to 1942, and Emily General (Cayuga), who established a series of annual plays to be performed at the Great Pine Forest Theatre on the Six Nations Reserve in 1949. In 1950, two non-Natives, Frank Morrison and Cecil West wrote and directed the opera \"Tzinquaw: The Thunderbird and the Killer Whale\", which premiered in Duncan, BC, performed by purely Native people. In Canada, playwrights James Reaney, John Herbert, and George Ryga made their contribution to Native theatre with \"The Ecstasy of Rita Joe\" (1970). Margo Kane (Saulteaux/Cree/Blackfoot) joined the production of \"The Ecstasy of Rita Joe\" in 1978 and became the first Native American actor to play the part of Rita Joe in 1981.\n\nAccording to Henry Schafer, 1985-1995 was the “Golden Age” of Native Theatre. Many Native Theatre companies and playwrights emerged during this period. Tomson Highway (Cree) joined the Native Earth Performing Arts (NEPA), starting as a musical director and performer. In 1985, Ondinnok Mythological Theatre was founded in Montreal by French-speaking Native playwright Yves Sioui Durand. Other Native Theatre companies that emerged during this period were: Tunooniq Theater, Awasikan Theatre, Urban Shaman and Native Youth Theatre R-Street Vision. In 1987, on the Hobbema Reserve, Four Winds Theatre Group was founded by Darrel and Lori Wildcat (Cree), along with cofounders Rosa and Melvin John. After the Four Winds Theatre Group closed in 1991, the Johns went on to form Kehewin Native Performance Resource Network (KNPRN). “KNPRN concentrates on traditional theatre, storytelling, and dance and works with young people, touring all over Canada and internationally.” (1) In 1992, Margo Kane founded Full Circle: First Nations Performance in British Columbia. Two of the most recent Native Theatre companies to emerge are Saskatchewan Native Theatre Company (1999) and Red Sky Performance in Toronto (2000). From 1995 to present day Native Theatre has struggled to maintain its size and popularity. One major issue the Native Theatre scene faced was lack of funding. Although some of the theatre companies closed and some still struggle to survive, the Native Theatre scene is continuing to develop and mature. “Even though Native theatre is a relatively recent phenomenon in Canada, it is by now an integral part of the Canadian cultural landscape. It takes on many forms and draws from various traditions like storytelling, European theatre, traditional dance, and multimedia. It resists any clear-cut definition and is constantly exploring new forms of expression.”\n\nThe stories that inspire Native American Theatre have been around for hundreds of years, but did not gain formal recognition by colonial America. This lack of recognition lasted until the 1930s when Lynn Riggs, a playwright of Cherokee descent, brought Native Theatre into the spotlight through the Six Nations Reserve Forest Theatre in Ontario. Through these events, Native Theatre has been introduced to mainstream society and contemporary Native American Theater was born. Canadian playwright Drew Hayden Taylor explains how Native American theatre has been around for centuries, but has only recently been highlighted in North American mainstream media: “Native Theatre is much older than the scant few years. It is as old as this country, as old as the people who have been here for thousands of years, as old as the stories that are still told today. It is merely the presentation that has changed.”\n\nSince the creation of contemporary Native American Theater, there have been plays available for publishing: “There are currently over 250 published and far over 600 unpublished plays by some 250 Native American and First Nations playwrights and theatre groups on the North American market.” These numbers do not include the plays inside the \"North American Indian Drama\" collection as of 2006. Even though there is a large amount of plays available for production or analysis, the Native American drama genre is often overlooked by not only the general public, but also by universities. Shari Huhndorf states “drama remains the most overlooked genre in Native American literature.” There needs to be more research and appreciation for Native American drama and its background. The lack of connection between plays from reservations and urban areas needs to improve in order for there to be more information from different angles and perspectives presented through dramatic literature. This can provide increased appreciation for Native American Theatre.\n\nContemporary Native American theater began in the 20th century and developed from oral culture and literature. These stories were used to “educate, entertain, and preserve” the new generations of the Native Americans. “However, indigenous theater was absent in Native writing during this period and the multiple reasons given for this nonexistence usually reflect a long history of silencing, discrimination, oppression, and displacement exercised in the genre.” These stories were usually told orally in a way accompanied by dancing, music, and other performances while the storyteller gets close to the audience to give them an immersive encounter of the story and the storyteller. These stories were usually exaggerated to give more drama for the audience. “This existence of this vibrant oral literature contrasts with the traditional Western conception that Native American cultures did not have history.” A non-Western historical record gave the misconception of Native Americans having no history before the arrival of European immigrants. Many Native American traditions and customs were suppressed due to colonization which prevented many from being able to tell their stories while they were oppressed. “The rise of the Civil Rights Movement during the 1960s and the 1970s also contributed to this reawakening of Native cultures since it appeared as a movement in which minorities demanded an end to discrimination and the right to speak for themselves.” This gave pride and encouraged many to seek inspiration from history and ancestral roots. Today there are many theater productions performing Native American works.\n\nAccording to Rolland Meinholtz, who is an “instructor and artistic director of drama and dance at the Institute of American Indian Arts,” youth must understand the struggles of Native American culture through contemporary plays. “They needed to know it, understand it, deal with it, struggle with it, hopefully integrate it, and lastly, build upon it.” In order to produce a play to convey a Native American themed message, you need dance, verse, drums, masks, facial painting. Even when the play consisted of non-Native Americans, Native American drama is all about the story and presentation, not about those who play the roles. “Nevertheless, there could be absolutely no question whose theatre we were witnessing. The spare setting, the drumming, the chanting and singing, the dancing, its episodic nature, and its wry point of view all proudly proclaimed this was Indian Theatre.” Coyote is a metaphor to describe the character of Native American theater. Native American Theater production that does not fit into western conventions cannot easily be categorized as comedy or tragedy. Thus, the coyote trickster represents the shape shifting nature of Native Theater itself. “For Indian theatre, there is no clear division of comedy and tragedy as found, for example, in ancient Greek drama. Comedy and tragedy are one: one extreme transforming into the other. Everything humans perceive as fixed is actually transitory and subject to transformation.” According to Meinholtz Japanese Noh drama is a guide to achieving the spiritual goals he intended for Native American drama. Meinholtz is inspired by ancient Native American architecture to create contemporary theater spaces. “The Great Kivas were not the only examples of theatrical structures among Native Americans. The Zuni people build specifically designed rooms onto their houses in which to house the annual Shalako Ceremony.”\n\nGeraldine Keams (Navajo Nation TV and film actress) disrupts Native American stereotypes in her work. Keams has challenges stereotypes through writing and creating plays that include Native American history, such as \"Flight of The Army Worm\", first performed in 1976 at Navajo Community College. \"Flight of the Army Worm\" is one of the first contemporary published plays that was done by a Native American Woman. Through \"Flight of The Army\" \"Worm\" Keams was able to educate others about the Navajo Nation. “The character of the announcer gives the audience factual information about historical events, while through song, the Guitar Player urges revolution. This combination of modes of presentation aims to sharpen spectator’s analysis of the historical events they see and hear about. Keams combines Western and Indigenous pedagogies by moving the story from the intellectual account by the announcer to the personal account of Grandmother.” \n\nThe Native Theater Movement was built from several theaters, like the American Indian theatre Ensemble, Thunderbird Theater, and Spiderwoman Theater. These theater companies helped consolidate a nationwide Native Theatre movement across the United States and Canada. Native American drama had to fight against indifference and lack of knowledge on the part of some mainstream audiences. Native American playwrights write for a larger audiences who may not be aware that Native Americans are a significant demographic. This creates a double burden on the need to educate as well as to create drama. The “Three Miguel sisters\" founded the Spiderwoman Theater (1975); their drama has raised the public profile of figures and themes of traditional Native American stories. As more anthologies of contemporary Native American drama are published, the variety and creativity of the contemporary scene has become more apparent. “Just the fact that you’re on the stage telling these stories is political, just the fact that you’re there…it is a public act claiming one's native identity is a political act.” The Native American Theatre Ensemble (1973) presented Native Americans on their own terms to combat stereotypical Indian misrepresentations.\n\nNative American playwrights challenge centuries of stereotypes to create realistic characters conceived from their own personal experiences. The American Indian Theater Ensemble resolved to not only to rectify the cultural image of the Native American, but also to produce a body of drama intended primarily for the Indian community. “The purpose of making the company pan-tribal was to deconstruct stereotypes.” Hanay Geiogamah was active in the founding years of the American Indian Theatre Ensemble, which produced his one-act play \"Body Indian\". \"Body Indian\" is pan-tribal work that demonstrates the problems Native American playwrights face in creating realistic drama based on contemporary Native American life. While Native people have been performing on the stages of the American theatre since the nineteenth century, at the turn of the twenty-first century, only a handful of articles on Native Theatre have been published, and most appeared in magazines rather than academic journals. Scholars in Canada embraced First Nations theatre more quickly, with much of the scholarship during the 1990s appearing in Canadian journals and published by Canadian presses. Now, twenty years later, Native and non-Native scholars seek to redefine the place of Indigenous theatre within the history of \"American\" theatre or, more accurately, the theatre of the Americas.\n\nIndigenous American cultures have been a major aspect of Chicano drama.\n\nChicano/playwrights have been inspired by Native American mythology and history through the use of symbolism and characters to represent Chicano/as, who are considered to be descendants of indigenous Mexico. Before the end of the Mexican War (1848), Mexico consisted of both Texas and California. The use of symbols in Chicano/a plays range from the use of characters being in the play on stage or “at other times the Indio is imagined through the use of Indigenous music, flutes, and drums.” These symbols provide information that is not easily seen and influence the action of the play and were influenced by the Chicano/an’s indigenous roots.\n\nIn the play Day of the Swallows, Estela Portillo Trambley uses an Indigenous male character to represent the protagonist’s Native American roots. The main character appears as the “noble savage” who represents the Indio in the play and Eduardo is paired with a contrasting character, Josefa, who is connected to her heritage and is traditionally feminine. Josefa’s connection to her heritage in this play “is through images that only she can see and feel.” This play uses these visions as symbols that are influenced by their indigenous heritage. “Eduardo symbolizes the best and the worst of humanity in Josefa’s world, for he is Nature personified as Man.” \"Mummified Deer\" was written in 1984 by Luis Valdez. His character Cajeme, a deer dancer named after a famous Yaqui who fought against the Mexican government, is portrayed through different elements in the play. “Cajeme represents her inner thoughts, her fears, her Yaqui blood and being.” These plays were written to reconnect Chicanos with their Native American roots.\n\nEstela Portillo Trambley and Luis Valdez were the most well-known authors of the Indigenous Chicano drama. They were the early proponents of bringing indigenous roots into Chicano/a plays. Trambley stated in an interview, “I hope…[Chicanos] still relate to seasons and to plants and to colors and to the wind, and to the Indian in them, or the element that is closest to the Earth.” Trambley is “regarded by most Chicano/critics and scholars as the author who inspired and opened the doors for all the Chicana writers who followed her.” Both of these playwrights used their own style while writing their individual plays. Trambley focused more on writing in the style of realism, which was more general with no indication of specific indigenous people, while Valdez wrote and produced in more specifics communities as well as by using “a surreal vision of the Chicano’s distorted postmodern, internally colonized condition.” Trambley stated in an interview, “I hope…[Chicanos] still relate to seasons and to plants and to colors and to the wind, and to the Indian in them, or the element that is closest to the Earth.”\n"}

The work is noted for distilling three episodes from the life of Christ into a single panel, rather than presenting them in triptych format. The scenes are, from left to right, the birth of Christ, the Adoration of the Magi and the adoration of the shepherds. The painting is harshly realistic; the Child Jesus and his parents are shown in poverty; the figures crowd within a single space shared with animals, in a room with a thatched roof with a hole and broken-down walls. In this Campin abandons the traditional narrative.\n\nThe Virgin is presented as in her teens, Joseph as a much older man. Four angels hover above them, holding gifts. Two of them hold a banner with lettering addressed to midwives in the lower portion of the panel; it reads \"Tangue puerum et sanabaris\" (\"touch the child and you shall be healed\"). From the little record we have of Campin, he was a major pioneer and innovator of painting, and here his appeal to the poverty of the Holy Family. His skill with oil paint is reflected in the positioning of the central figures in the extreme foreground, giving the panel a very tight and focused feel, despite the highly detailed background details and landscape. The hut is slanted compared to the outline of the frame, a device later adopted by Rogier van der Weyden in his Bladelin Altarpiece.\n\nCampin places a landscape complete with a view of a lake beyond of the stable, just above the two midwives. Reinforcing the idea of redemption, Salome is given a prominent position, facing outwards towards the viewer in the mid foreground.\n\nThe panel is housed in the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon.\n\n"}
{"id": "30370277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30370277", "title": "Nautilus (photograph)", "text": "Nautilus (photograph)\n\nNautilus is a black-and-white photograph taken by Edward Weston in 1927 of a single nautilus shell standing on its end against a dark background. It has been called \"one of the most famous photographs ever made\" and \"a benchmark of modernism in the history of photography.\"\n\nIn February, 1927, Weston visited the studio of local Carmel artist Henrietta Shore and noticed several paintings she had made of sea shells. Only one of these paintings is known to still exist (as of January, 2011), and it shows a stark and solitary nautilus on a dark field, not unlike Weston's resulting photographs. He made it clear in his writings that the paintings had a profound effect on him:\n\nWithin a month he began photographing several different large chambered nautiluses, either whole or cut in half to reveal their inner structure. He used his Ansco 8 × 10 Commercial view camera with a Rapid Rectilinear lens stopped down to US256 (equivalent to f/64) . Notations he made about his exposures during this period indicate that the film he used would be rated approximately equivalent to 16 on today's ISO scale.\n\nDue to the technical limitations of the film and the camera he used, he was forced to make extremely long exposures that were easily ruined by vibrations. Weston's grandson Kim Weston said his grandfather propped up the shell on the end of an oil drum (the arc of the drum can barely be seen in the background of the image), and the thin metal oil drum head was sensitive to the slightest movement. Weston expressed his frustrations in his 'Daybooks\":\n\nHe recorded that over the next several months he made fourteen negatives of shells. It's not known exactly when he took this particular image, but it had to have been made between April 1 and June 8, 1927, when he recorded in his journal \"Last evening I had printed, and am ready to show all shell negatives…\".\n\n\"Nautilus\" is now recognized as one of Weston's greatest photographs, but all of his images of shells have a greater-than-life quality to them. Weston biographer Ben Maddow has said that what is so remarkable about them \"is not in the closeness nor in the monumentality of the forms; or at least, not in these alone. It is instead in the particular light, almost an inward luminescence, that he saw implicit in them before he put them before the lens. Glowing with an interior life . .. one is seeing more than form.\"\n\nOne historian wrote \"The nautilus shells proved a turning point in Weston’s career and marked a critical phase in his development as one of the greatest photographers of the 20th century, a pioneering modernist whose stunning simplicity and technical mastery are often imitated but never quite equaled.\" \"\n\nMuch has been said about Weston's intentions in photographing shells. He recorded that some of the first people to see them had intensely erotic reactions:\n\nAt the same time, Weston strongly denied in his writings that he had any thought, much less intention, of recording erotic symbolism:\n\nYet, in another entry about one of his nude images he said \"I saw the repeated curves of thigh and calf, ‒ the shin bone, knee and thigh lines forming shapes not unlike great sea shells…\"\n\nWeston wrote that he made twenty-eights prints of this image on at least four different types of paper, including a matte Kodak Azo and a semi-gloss Agfa Convira. In a few early versions he extended the bottom margin of the image down to the notches on the film negative. Most prints measure approximately 9 by 7 in. (24 by 19 cm.)\n\nOn April 13, 2010, a print of this image made by Weston in year it was taken sold for $1,082,500 at an auction in New York. As of January, 2013, it was the fourteenth most expensive photograph ever sold. Weston originally sold it for $10.\n\nPrints of this image are now in the collections of the Center for Creative Photography, the George Eastman House and the Museum of Modern Art.\n\n"}

Popular book picks have been Harper Lee's \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", Ernest Gaines's \"A Lesson Before Dying\", Ray Bradbury's \"Fahrenheit 451\", and Rudolfo Anaya's \"Bless Me, Ultima\".\n\nOne City One Book programs take the idea of a localized book discussion club and expand it to cover a whole city.\nThe first such program was \"If All of Seattle Read the Same Book\" in 1998, started by Nancy Pearl at Seattle Public Library's Washington Center for the Book.\nThe book chosen for the program was 'The Sweet Hereafter' by Russell Banks, written in 1991. Other cities copied the idea, and the Library of Congress listed 404 programs occurring in 2007.\n\nEach city's program has its own goals; these typically include building a sense of community and promoting literacy.\nNancy Pearl warns against expecting too much from a program: \"Keep in mind that this is a library program, it's not an exercise in civics, it's not intended to have literature cure the racial divide. This is about a work of literature.\"\n\nPrograms typically involve more than having everyone read the same book. Some other activities that have been included are: book discussion sessions, scholarly lectures on the book or related topics, a visit by the author, exhibits, related arts programming (especially showing a movie of the book if there is one), and integration into school curricula.\nIn Boston the \"One City One Story\" program used shorter stories and distributed tens of thousands of free copies of the story over the course of a month.\n\nAmerican Library Association puts out a detailed step-by-step guide on how to organize a local program, including the critical step of picking the one book. The Center for the Book at the Library of Congress tracks all known programs and the books they have used.\n\n\"Most listed are in the United States, perhaps because the meme started there and similar programs elsewhere have a different name.\"\n\nPrograms sponsored by public libraries are tracked each year by the Library of Congress. Most programs maintain their own websites devoted to the annual effort.\n\nThe Library of Congress maintains a website with resources for cities that want to run One Book programs, including a partial list of authors and list of past programs. Some states and the ALA maintain their own resources to help cities get started.\n\n\n\nCity Reads, Brighton is the longest running and most consistent 'big read' in the UK. Led by artistic director Sarah Hutchings, it is delivered by award-winning literary organisation Collected Works CIC. City Reads is an annual collective reading festival conceived to spread a love of books and ideas to the widest possible audience throughout Brighton & Hove, with a healthy reach into the South East region. Over three weeks in October one book is chosen for the whole community to creatively engage with in a series of special events, workshops and performances. Through the outstanding quality of its work, its ability to foster collaboration and the partnerships that support the Festival, City Reads brings regional and national attention to the importance of shared reading and the benefits it can bring to the whole community. 2015 marks the 10th anniversary of City Reads, Brighton. The City Reads slogan is: One city. One book. A thousand conversations... The Festival began in 2005 when the City celebrated Penguin Books' 70th Anniversary and read Lewis Carroll's \"Alice in Wonderland\". In 2013, with the support of writer, broadcaster and former children's laureate Michael Rosen Young City Reads was launched. Working with primary aged children at KS2 level, Young City Reads is thought to be the first 'big read' for children in the UK, on such a large scale.\n\nSouthampton University:\nOne Book, One Southampton (OBOS) is the University of Southampton’s initiative to engage with our community through reading. Similar initiatives have been trialled in other institutions internationally, but there are very few UK University One Book programmes. The University encourage staff, students and our local and international community to join us in debates, lectures, talks and online forums to discuss OBOS and explore the themes, subjects and debates that the book raises. You can listen to discussions on the subject, and attend events about the book. The University of Southampton announced that the 2014 book will be Empire by Jeremy Paxman. \nSome cities that have run independent One Book programs have later joined Big Read instead. An annual \"One World, Many Stories\" summer reading campaign for children, which has a single selection for the country, has become popular as well.\n\nFor some, the mere idea of reading as a communal activity is repellent. The literary critic Harold Bloom said, \"I don't like these mass reading bees... It is rather like the idea that we are all going to pop out and eat Chicken McNuggets or something else horrid at once.\"\n\nOthers are concerned about the temptation to use such a program to promote social values. Phillip Lopate fears a promotion of groupthink, saying \"It is a little like a science fiction plot -- 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' or something.\"\n\nIn New York City in 2002, the effort foundered when the selectors split into two rival groups, each with its own favorite: Chang-Rae Lee's \"Native Speaker\" and James McBride's \"The Color of Water\". Both books were considered to be offensive to some of New York's ethnic groups.\nNancy Pearl said,\n\"It's turned into something not to do with literature but to do with curing the ills in society, and while there is a role for that, to ask a book to fit everybody's agenda in talking about particular issues just does a disservice to literature.\"\n\nGovernments are sometimes concerned that their endorsement of reading a book will be viewed as endorsing the ideas or language of the book. In Texas in 2006, the Galveston County Reads committee recommended Mark Haddon's \"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\" as the choice for their county-wide read. There was much criticism of the choice from the Mayor and Council of Friendswood, who objected to obscenity in the novel, and said that it contained ideas that should not be promoted to kids and that taxpayer money should not be used to promote and purchase a book the community wouldn't approve of.\n"}

It was established in 1968 and now has showrooms worldwide. It was among the brands included in the Victoria and Albert Museum's \"British Design 1948–2012: Innovation in the Modern Age\" exhibition in 2012.\n\nOsborne & Little was established by Sir Peter Osborne (father of Conservative Party politician George Osborne) and his brother-in-law Antony Little. The company's shop, in the King's Road, Chelsea, put it in the heart of Swinging London.\n\nLittle was the designer – he had been responsible for Biba's distinctive black and gold logo – and created most of the company's early ranges. Hand-printed papers were inspired by everything from the designs of Aubrey Beardsley to the Brighton Pavilion Its success in reinterpreting classic designs in new ways during the 1970s and '80s meant that Little soon presided over a large design team. In the book \"Twentieth Century Pattern Design\", Lesley Jackson described the brand as distinctive for its bold reinterpretations of traditional patterns, adding: \"historical references tend to be lateral rather than literal\".\n\nThe company took over Isabel Tisdall's Tamesa Fabrics in 1985 and later acquired the distribution rights to Lorca fabrics and Liberty Furnishings. It has a longstanding association with interior designer Nina Campbell, distributing her collections. The company has a wholly owned US subsidiary and showrooms across Europe, in addition to retailing via UK stores such as John Lewis. Its high-profile clients have included Bill and Hillary Clinton, who used Osborne & Little designs in their private apartment at the White House.\n\nThe company was formerly listed on the London Stock Exchange, delisting in 2003; it had a turnover of almost £33m in 2011, with a quarter of this coming from sales in mainland Europe. Little retired from the business in 2005 and Osborne remains CEO. Former Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne retains a shareholding in the company.\n\nThe company recorded a pre-tax profit of £722,000 on turnover of £34 million in 2014/5. The highest paid director, possibly Peter Osborne, was paid £684,000. Using the 2014/15 UK income tax calculator reveals this would result in combined income tax and national insurance deductions of £310,838.28.\n\nIn 2015 it was revealed by \"Private Eye\" that, despite having made a pre-tax profit of £722,000, the company paid no corporation tax for the year 2015 – thereby avoiding a \"tax bill\" of £179,000. The magazine also revealed that the company had not paid any corporation tax since 2008 and had even received a tax credit of £12,000 in the year 2010. This was due to the company making losses totalling £9 million between 2009 and 2014, which allow the carry forward of credits for losses against the 2015 corporation tax bill. Despite these substantial losses, the companies' directors collected £1.2million in the year 2012 alone. The former Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, owns a 15% stake in the company, which is estimated to be worth between 15 and 30 million pounds.\n\nOsborne & Little has collaborated with a number of other British fashion and textile designers over the years, including Zandra Rhodes, Neisha Crosland and Matthew Williamson.\n\n"}
{"id": "1830983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1830983", "title": "Perchta", "text": "Perchta\n\nPerchta or Berchta (English: Bertha), also commonly known as Percht and other variations, was once known as a goddess in Alpine paganism in the Upper German and Austrian regions of the Alps. Her name may mean \"the bright one\" (Old High German \"beraht, bereht\", from Proto-Germanic *\"brehtaz\") and is probably related to the name \"Berchtentag\", meaning the feast of the Epiphany. Eugen Mogk provides an alternative etymology, attributing the origin of the name \"Perchta\" to the Old High German verb \"pergan\", meaning \"hidden\" or \"covered\". \n\nPerchta is often identified as stemming from the same Germanic goddess as Holda and other female figures of German folklore (see Frija-Frigg). According to Jacob Grimm and Lotte Motz, Perchta is Holda's southern cousin or equivalent, as they both share the role of \"guardian of the beasts\" and appear during the Twelve Days of Christmas, when they oversee spinning. \n\nGrimm says Perchta or Berchta was known \"precisely in those Upper German regions where Holda leaves off, in Swabia, in Alsace, in Switzerland, in Bavaria and Austria.\"\n\nAccording to Erika Timm, Perchta emerged from an amalgamation of Germanic and pre-Germanic, probably Celtic, traditions of the Alpine regions after the Migration Period in the Early Middle Ages.\n\nPerchta had many different names depending on the era and region: Grimm listed the names \"Perahta\" and \"Berchte\" as the main names (in his heading), followed by \"Berchta\" in Old High German, as well as \"Behrta\" and \"Frau Perchta\". In Baden, Swabia, Switzerland and Slovenian regions, she was often called \"Frau Faste\" (the lady of the Ember days) or Pehta or 'Kvaternica', in Slovene. Elsewhere she was known as \"Posterli,\" \"Quatemberca\" and \"Fronfastenweiber\".\n\nIn southern Austria, in Carinthia among the Slovenes, a male form of Perchta was known as \"Quantembermann\", in German, or \"Kvaternik\", in Slovene (the man of the four Ember days). Grimm thought that her male counterpart or equivalent is \"Berchtold.\"\n\nRegional variations of the name include \"Berigl\", \"Berchtlmuada\", \"Perhta-Baba\", \"Zlobna Pehta\", \"Bechtrababa\", \"Sampa\", \"Stampa\", \"Lutzl\", \"Zamperin\", \"Pudelfrau\", \"Zampermuatta\" and \"Rauweib\".\n\nIn some descriptions, Perchta has two forms; she may appear either as beautiful and white as snow like her name, or as elderly and haggard.\n\nIn many old descriptions, Perchta had one large foot, sometimes called a goose foot or swan foot. Grimm thought the strange foot symbolized her being a higher being who could shapeshift to animal form. He noticed that Bertha with a strange foot exists in many languages (Middle German \"Berhte mit dem fuoze\", French \"Berthe au grand pied\", Latin \"Berhta cum magno pede\", Italian \" Berta dai gran piè\", title of a medieval epic poem of italian area): \"It is apparently a swan maiden's foot, which as a mark of her higher nature she cannot lay aside...and at the same time the spinning-woman's splayfoot that worked the treadle\".\n\nIn the Tyrol she appears as little old woman with a very wrinkled face, bright lively eyes, and a long hooked nose; her hair is disheveled, her garments tattered and torn.\n\nInitially, Perchta was the upholder of cultural taboos, such as the prohibition against spinning on holidays. In the folklore of Bavaria and Austria, Perchta was said to roam the countryside at midwinter, and to enter homes during the twelve days between Christmas and Epiphany (especially on the Twelfth Night). She would know whether the children and young servants of the household had behaved well and worked hard all year. If they had, they might find a small silver coin the next day, in a shoe or pail. If they had not, she would slit their bellies open, remove their stomach and guts, and stuff the hole with straw and pebbles. She was particularly concerned to see that girls had spun the whole of their allotted portion of flax or wool during the year. She would also slit people's bellies open and stuff them with straw if they ate something on the night of her feast day, other than the traditional meal of fish and gruel.\n\nThe cult of Perchta, under which followers left food and drink for \"Fraw Percht\" and her followers in the hope of receiving wealth and abundance, was condemned in Bavaria in the \"Thesaurus pauperum\" (1468) and by Thomas Ebendorfer von Haselbach in \"De decem praeceptis\" (1439).\n\nLater canonical and church documents characterized Perchta as synonymous with other leading female spirits: Holda, Diana, Herodias, Richella and Abundia.\n\nGrimm thought Holda is her equivalent while the Weisse Frauen may derive directly from Berchta in her white form.\n\nThe word \"Perchten\" is plural for Perchta, and this has become the name of her entourage, as well as the name of animal masks worn in parades and festivals in the mountainous regions of Austria. In the 16th century, the Perchten took two forms: Some are beautiful and bright, known as the \"Schönperchten\" (\"beautiful Perchten\"). These come during the Twelve Nights and festivals to \"bring luck and wealth to the people.\" The other form is the \"Schiachperchten\" (\"ugly Perchten\") who have fangs, tusks and horse tails which are used to drive out demons and ghosts. Men dressed as the ugly Perchten during the 16th century and went from house to house driving out bad spirits.\n\nSometimes, \"der Teufel\" is viewed as the most \"schiach\" (\"ugly\") \"Percht\" and \"Frau Perchta\" as the most \"schön\" (\"beautiful\") \"Percht\".\n\nIn Italy, Perchta is roughly equivalent with La Befana, who visits all the children of Italy on the night before 6 January to fill their socks with candy if they are good or a lump of coal if they are bad.\n\nAccording to Jacob Grimm (1882), Perchta was spoken of in Old High German in the 10th century as Frau Berchta and thought to be a white-robed goddess who oversaw spinning and weaving, like the myths of Holda. He believed she was the feminine equivalent of Berchtold, and was sometimes the leader of the Wild Hunt. However, John B. Smith disagrees and suggests that Perchta represents the personification of the feast of the Epiphany (Perchta's Day), and is therefore not pre-Christian.\n\nIn contemporary culture, Perchta is portrayed as a \"rewarder of the generous, and the punisher of the bad, particularly lying children\".\nToday in Austria, particularly Salzburg, where she is said to wander through Hohensalzburg Castle in the dead of night, the Perchten are still a traditional part of holidays and festivals (such as the Carnival Fastnacht). The wooden animal masks made for the festivals are today called \"Perchten\".\n\nIn the Pongau region of Austria large processions of \"Schönperchten\" (\"beautiful Perchten\") and \"Schiachperchten\" (\"ugly Perchten\") are held every winter. Beautiful masks are said to encouraging financial windfalls, and the ugly masks are worn to drive away evil spirits.\n\nOther regional variations include the \"Tresterer\" in the Austrian Pinzgau region, the stilt dancers in the town of Unken, the \"Schnabelpercht\" (\"trunked Percht\") in the Unterinntal region and the \"Glöcklerlaufen\" (\"bell-running\") in the Salzkammergut. A number of large ski-resorts have turned the tradition into a tourist attraction drawing large crowds every winter.\n\n"}

{"id": "320711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=320711", "title": "Robert Mapplethorpe", "text": "Robert Mapplethorpe\n\nRobert Mapplethorpe (; November 4, 1946 – March 9, 1989) was an American photographer, known for his sensitive yet blunt treatment of controversial subject-matter in the large-scale, highly stylized black and white medium of photography. His work featured an array of subjects, including celebrity portraits, male and female nudes, self-portraits and still-life images of flowers. His most controversial work is that of the BDSM subculture in the late 1960s and early 1970s of New York City. The homoeroticism of this work fuelled a national debate over the public funding of controversial artwork.\n\nMapplethorpe was born in Floral Park, Queens, New York City, the son of Joan Dorothy (Maxey) and Harry Irving Mapplethorpe, an electrical engineer. He was of English, Irish, and German descent, and grew up as a Roman Catholic in Our Lady of the Snows Parish. He had three brothers and two sisters. He studied for a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, where he majored in Graphic Arts, though he dropped out in 1969 before finishing his degree. Mapplethorpe lived with his close friend Patti Smith from 1967 to 1972, and she supported him by working in bookstores. They created art together, and maintained a close relationship.\n\nMapplethorpe took his first photographs in the late 1960s or early 1970s using a Polaroid camera. In 1972 he met art curator Sam Wagstaff who would become his mentor and lifetime companion. In the mid-1970s Wagstaff acquired a Hasselblad medium-format camera and Mapplethorpe began taking photographs of a wide circle of friends and acquaintances, including artists, composers, and socialites. During this time, he became friends with New Orleans artist George Dureau, whose work had such a profound impact on Mapplethorpe that he restaged many of Dureau's early photographs. From 1977 until 1980, Mapplethorpe was the lover of writer and \"Drummer\" magazine editor Jack Fritscher, who introduced him to Mineshaft.\n\nBy the 1980s Mapplethorpe's subject matter focused on statuesque male and female nudes, delicate flower still lifes, and highly formal portraits of artists and celebrities. Mapplethorpe's first studio was at 24 Bond Street in Manhattan. In the 1980s, Wagstaff bought a top-floor loft at 35 West 23rd Street for Robert, where he resided, also using it as a photo-shoot studio. He kept the Bond Street loft as his darkroom. In 1988, Mapplethorpe selected Patricia Morrisroe to write his biography, which was based on more than 300 interviews with celebrities, critics, lovers, and Mapplethorpe himself.\n\nMapplethorpe died on the morning of March 9, 1989 at the age of 42 due to complications from HIV/AIDS, in a Boston, Massachusetts hospital. His body was cremated. His ashes are interred at St. John's Cemetery, Queens in New York, at his mother's grave-site, etched \"Maxey\".\n\nNearly a year before his death, the ailing Mapplethorpe helped found the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation, Inc. His vision for the Foundation was that it would be \"the appropriate vehicle to protect his work, to advance his creative vision, and to promote the causes he cared about\". Since his death, the Foundation has not only functioned as his official estate and helped promote his work throughout the world, but has also raised and donated millions of dollars to fund medical research in the fight against AIDS and HIV infection and to promote fine art photography at the institutional level. The Foundation also determines which galleries represent Mapplethorpe's art. In 2011, the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation donated the Robert Mapplethorpe Archive, spanning from 1970 to 1989, to the Getty Research Institute.\n\nMapplethorpe worked primarily in a studio, and almost exclusively in black and white, with the exception of some of his later work and his final exhibit \"New Colors\". His body of work features a wide range of subjects, but his main focus and the greater part of his work is erotic imagery. He would refer to some of his own work as pornographic, with the aim of arousing the viewer, but which could also be regarded as high art. His erotic art explored a wide range of sexual subjects, depicting the BDSM subculture of New York in the 1970s, portrayals of black male nudes, and classical nudes of female bodybuilders. Mapplethorpe was a participant observer for much of his erotic photography, participating in the sexual acts which he was photographing and engaging his models sexually.\n\nOther subjects included flowers, especially orchids and calla lilies, children, statues, and celebrities and other artists, including Andy Warhol, Louise Bourgeois, Deborah Harry, Kathy Acker, Richard Gere, Peter Gabriel, Grace Jones, Amanda Lear, Laurie Anderson, Iggy Pop, Philip Glass, David Hockney, Cindy Sherman, Joan Armatrading and Patti Smith. Smith was a longtime roommate of Mapplethorpe and a frequent subject in his photography, including a stark, iconic photograph that appears on the cover of Smith's first album, \"Horses\". His work often made reference to religious or classical imagery, such as a portrait of Patti Smith from 1986 which recalls Albrecht Dürer's 1500 self-portrait. Between 1980 and 1983, Mapplethorpe created over 150 photographs of bodybuilder Lisa Lyon, culminating in the 1983 photobook \"Lady, Lisa Lyon\", published by Viking Press and with text by Bruce Chatwin.\n\nIn the summer of 1989, Mapplethorpe's traveling solo exhibit brought national attention to the issues of public funding for the arts, as well as questions of censorship and the obscene. The Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., had agreed to be one of the host museums for the tour. Mapplethorpe decided to show his latest series that he explored shortly before his death. Titled \"Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment\", the show included photographs from his X Portfolio, which featured images of urophagia, BDSM and a self-portrait with a bullwhip inserted in his anus. The show was curated by Janet Kardon of the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA). The ICA was awarded a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to support Mapplethorpe's exhibit at the Corcoran Gallery of Art. The cancellation of the show, which terminated the Corcoran's contract with the ICA, was due to the fact that the museum did not want to get involved in the politics. Instead, the Corcoran was pulled into the controversy, which \"intensified the debate waged both in the media and in Congress surrounding the NEA's funding of projects perceived by some individuals... to be inappropriate...\" The hierarchy of the Corcoran and several members of the U.S. Congress were upset when the works were revealed to them, due to the homoerotic and sadomasochistic themes of some of the work. Though much of his work throughout his career had been regularly displayed in publicly funded exhibitions, conservative and religious organizations, such as the American Family Association, seized on this exhibition to vocally oppose government support for what they called \"nothing more than the sensational presentation of potentially obscene material.\"\n\nIn June 1989, pop artist Lowell Blair Nesbitt became involved in the censorship issue. Nesbitt, a long-time friend of Mapplethorpe, revealed that he had a $1.5-million bequest to the museum in his will, but publicly promised that if the museum refused to host the exhibition, he would revoke the bequest. The Corcoran refused and Nesbitt bequeathed the money to the Phillips Collection instead. After the Corcoran refused the Mapplethorpe exhibition, the underwriters of the exhibition went to the nonprofit Washington Project for the Arts, which showed all the images in its space from July 21 to August 13, 1989, to large crowds.\nIn 1990, the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati, and Dennis Barrie, were charged with obscenity. They were found not guilty by a jury.\n\nAccording to the ICA, \"The Corcoran's decision sparked a controversial national debate: Should tax dollars support the arts? Who decides what is \"obscene\" or \"offensive\" in public exhibitions? And if art can be considered a form of free speech, is it a violation of the First Amendment to revoke federal funding on grounds of obscenity? To this day, these questions remain very much at issue.\" Mapplethorpe became something of a cause célèbre for both sides of the American culture war. However, prices for many of the Mapplethorpe photographs doubled and even tripled as a consequence of all the attention. The artist's notoriety supposedly also helped the posthumous sale at Christie's auction house of Mapplethorpe's own collection of furniture, pottery, silver and works by other artists, which brought about $8 million.\n\nIn 1998, the University of Central England was involved in a controversy when a book by Mapplethorpe was confiscated. A final-year undergraduate student was writing a paper on the work of Robert Mapplethorpe and intended to illustrate the paper with a few photographs from \"Mapplethorpe\", a book of the photographer's work. She took the photographs to the local chemist to be developed and the chemist informed West Midlands Police because of the unusual nature of the images. The police confiscated the library book from the student and informed the university that the book would have to be destroyed. If the university agreed to the destruction, no further action would be taken.\n\nThe university Vice-Chancellor, Dr. Peter Knight, supported by the Senate, took the view that the book was a legitimate book for the university library to hold and that the action of the police was a serious infringement of academic freedom. The Vice-Chancellor was interviewed by the police, under caution, with a view to prosecution under the terms of the Obscene Publications Acts.\n\nAfter the interview with the Vice-Chancellor, a file was sent to the Crown Prosecution Service for a determination by the Director of Public Prosecutions whether to proceed with a trial. After a delay of about six months, the affair came to an end when Dr. Knight was informed by the DPP that no action would be taken.\n\nThe 1986 solo exhibition \"Black Males\" and the subsequent book \"The Black Book\" sparked controversy for their depiction of black men. The images, erotic depictions of black men, were widely criticized for being exploitative. The work was largely phallocentric and sculptural, focusing on segments of the subject's bodies. His purported intention with these photographs and the use of black men as models was the pursuit of the Platonic ideal. Mapplethorpe's initial interest in the black male form was inspired by films like \"Mandingo\" and the interrogation scene in \"Cruising,\" in which an unknown black character enters the interrogation room and slaps the protagonist across the face.\n\nCriticism was the subject of a work by American conceptual artist Glenn Ligon,\" Notes on the Margins of the Black Book\" (1991–1993). Ligon juxtaposes Mapplethorpe's 91 images of black men in the 1988 publication \"Black Book\" with critical texts and personal reactions about the work to complicate the racial undertones of the imagery.\n\nAmerican poet and activist Essex Hemphill also expressed criticism in his anthology \"Brother to Brother\" (1991). Although he believed that Mapplethorpe's work reflected exceptional talent, Hemphill also believed that it displayed a lack of concern for black individuals in the gay community, \"except as sexual subjects\".\n\nIn 1992, author Paul Russell dedicated his novel \"Boys of Life\" to Mapplethorpe, as well as to Karl Keller and Pier Paolo Pasolini.\n\nWhen \"Mapplethorpe: A Biography\" by Patricia Morrisroe was published by Random House in 1995, the \"Washington Post Book World\" described it as \"Mesmerizing... Morrisroe has succeeded in re-creating the photographer's world of light and dark.\" Art critic Arthur C. Danto, writing in \"The Nation\", praised it as \"utterly admirable... The clarity and honesty of Morrisroe's portrait are worthy of its subject.\"\n\nIn 1996, Patti Smith wrote a book \"The Coral Sea\" dedicated to Mapplethorpe.\n\nPhilips released a photo disc for their CD-i video game system in the late 1990s called \"The Flowers of Robert Mapplethorpe\".\n\nIn September 1999, Arena Editions published \"Pictures,\" a monograph that reintroduced Mapplethorpe's sex pictures. In 2000, \"Pictures\" was seized by two South Australian plain-clothes detectives from an Adelaide bookshop in the belief that the book breached indecency and obscenity laws. Police sent the book to the Canberra-based Office of Film and Literature Classification after the state Attorney-General's Department deftly decided not to get involved in the mounting publicity storm. Eventually, the OFLC board agreed unanimously that the book, imported from the United States, should remain freely available and unrestricted.\n\nIn May 2007, American writer, director, and producer James Crump directed the documentary film \"Black White + Gray\", which premiered at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival. It explores the influence Mapplethorpe, curator Sam Wagstaff, and musician/poet Patti Smith had on the 1970s art scene in New York City.\n\nIn September 2007, Prestel published \"Mapplethorpe: Polaroids\", a collection of 183 of approximately 1,500 existing Mapplethorpe polaroids. This book accompanies an exhibition by the Whitney Museum of American Art in May 2008.\n\nIn 2008, Robert Mapplethorpe was named by Equality Forum as one of their 31 Icons of the 2015 LGBT History Month.\n\nPatti Smith's 2010 memoir \"Just Kids\" focuses on her relationship with Mapplethorpe. The book won the 2010 National Book Award for Nonfiction.\n\nIn June 2016, Belgian fashion designer Raf Simons debuted his mens Spring 2017 collection inspired by Mapplethorpe's work and featuring several of his photographs printed onto shirts, jackets, and smocks.\n\nThe American documentary film, \",\" was released in 2016. It was directed and executive produced by Randy Barbato and Fenton Bailey, and produced by Katharina Otto-Bernstein.\n\nIn January 2016, filmmaker Ondi Timoner announced that she was directing a feature about him, \"Mapplethorpe,\" with Matt Smith in the lead role. The film premiered on April 22, 2018 at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York City.\n\nIn 2017, a 1987 Mapplethorpe self-portrait platinum print was auctioned for £450,000, making it the most expensive Mapplethorpe photograph ever sold.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20258664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20258664", "title": "Roosevelt Red Ware", "text": "Roosevelt Red Ware\n\nRoosevelt Red Ware, also known as Salado Red Ware and Salado Polychrome, is a late prehistoric pottery tradition found across large portions of Arizona and New Mexico. The tradition involves the combination of red, white, and black paint in varying configurations along with compositional and morphological characteristics. This ceramic tradition begins about AD 1280-1290 and lasts until at least AD 1450 based on tree-ring dating.\n\nArchaeologists have argued over the nature of Salado as a cultural phenomenon or an ideological one spreading through the Southwest. Some archaeologists have chosen to use the term Salado Polychromes so as not to give undue emphasis to the Roosevelt Lake area, once thought to be the center of production. Both terms, Salado Red Ware and Roosevelt Red Ware are still used by archaeologists.\n\nIn her 1994 volume, Dr. Patricia Crown suggested four models with which to analyze Salado Polychromes. They are \"elite symbols of authority or items of exchange,\" \"indicators of participation in an economic alliance/regional system,\" \"objects associated with the spread of a religious ideology,\" and as \"markers of ethnicity for a migrant group\" (Crown 1994: vi). More recently archaeologists have examined these types distribution across the Southwest (Lyons 2003) and suggests that these types are markers of migrant groups emanating from northeastern Arizona.\n\nRoosevelt Red Ware is divided by archaeologists into a series of types, which cover shorter spans of time, based on configurations of the painted designs and rim profiles of bowls.\nRoosevelt Red Ware has traditionally been organized into three types based on stylistic differences. More recently researchers at Archaeology Southwest (previously named the Center for Desert Archaeology) in Tucson, Arizona have identified an additional six types based on a combination of stylistic and morphological characteristics. For bowls with both interior and exterior decoration, the exterior style is labeled as the variant (Example: Gila interior with a Tonto exterior would be labeled as Gila Polychrome: Tonto Variant)\n\nAll types within this ware share a number of broad categorical similarities although over a roughly 250 year time span significant variation is seen. The paste is generally brown to reddish-brown in color and is tempered with sand. Generally red and/or white slip cover both the interior and exterior and black paint is used on one or both surfaces, usually surrounded by white rather than red slip. Black paint is most commonly organic, but a mixture of organic and mineral paint appears on some vessels. Petrographic analyses have shown that Roosevelt Red Ware is produced across the full distributional range.\n\nPinto Polychrome is the earliest of the Roosevelt Red Wares and dates from AD 1280 to 1330. Pinto Polychrome vessels are only found in the form of bowls and lack the banding line, also called a \"life-line\" by some authors, that identify Gila Polychrome. Stylistically Pinto Polychrome is reminiscent of St Johns Polychrome in its layout of opposed hatched and solid elements, although the type exhibits a period of experimentation with colors and layouts that continue through subsequent types.\n\nPinto polychrome is found along the Mogollon Rim in Arizona as well as the Tonto Basin, Sierra Ancha, Globe Highlands, San Pedro Valley, Point of Pines Area, Kinishba Area and the Upper Gila Valley (Neuzil and Lyons 2005: 34).\n\nThere is a transitional variant that has been noted by some authors known as Pinto-Gila Polychrome. This type exhibits the more bold designs generally found in Gila Polychrome but lacks the banding line and is still only found in bowls. Some authors have chosen not to use this type arguing that types tend to blur in transitional periods between types and that adding types adds no additional analytical usefulness. Pinto Polychrome is also contains a Salmon Variety (see Gila Polychrome).\n\nSimilar in dates, designs, and geographic distribution to Pinto Polychrome but without the white slip underlying black paint.\n\nGila Polychrome is the first type in this series to be found in both bowls and jars. Stylistically Gila Polychrome is identified by bolder motifs than Pinto Polychrome and bowls are most readily identified by the banding line just below the interior rim. Jars have broad stripes of white slip with black designs, although the bases are usually still slipped red. Sometimes jars exhibit multiple parallel bands of black on white decoration separated by thin bands of red slip. Gila Polychrome, Salmon Variety, replaces the usual white slip with a pinkish slip but otherwise remains stylistically similar (Neuzil and Lyons 2005: 21-22).\n\nGila Polychrome is produced from about AD 1300-1450 across Arizona, New Mexico and northern Mexico, north of Casas Grandes, Chihuahua.\n\nSimilar in dates, designs and geographic distribution to Gila Polychrome but without the white slip underlying black paint.\n\nTonto Polychrome is found in higher frequencies on jars. The black on white designs are generally narrower bands than on Gila jars, or panels of decoration, and are surrounded by red slip. This type has a later starting date than Gila Polychrome, AD 1340 and an end date of 1450.\n\nCliff Polychrome is identified by stylistic and morphological characteristics that distinguish it from Gila Polychrome. Dates given for this type range from AD 1300-1450 (Lyons 2004).\n\nThis type is found in bowl form and can be partially identified by recurved and semi-flaring rims. Accompanying the shift in bowl shape is a drop in the banding line, creating a secondary design field between the banding line and the rim. Design elements otherwise are similar to those found on Gila and Tonto Polychrome vessels.\n\nLyons (2004) describes the spatial distribution for this type as ranging from Petrified National Forest, Arizona to Casas Grandes, Chihuahua, Mexico and from the Phoenix basin to Alamogordo, New Mexico. The locus of heaviest production for this type seems to be centered around southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico possibly indicating the location of origin for this type. Temporal distribution would seem to indicate that this type is temporally significant since sites exist throughout the distributional range containing both Gila and Tonto Polychrome, but lacking Cliff Polychrome.\n\nNine Mile Polychrome is similar to Cliff Polychrome in that it only occurs in bowls with a recurved rim with a black-on-white band of design on the bowl interior just below the rim, the area above the banding line on Cliff Polychrome. Unlike Cliff Polychrome however, the rest of the interior of this type is red slipped without any additional elaboration, including lack of a banding line. Generally Nine Mile Polychrome vessels have either a Gila or Tonto Polychrome exterior decoration. This type is found in the region from the Cliff Valley to Perry Mesa, and from the Middle Verde Valley to the area around Douglas, Arizona. While rare, this type seems to have its greatest density around the far southeastern portion of its distribution. This type dates from the timer period AD 1375-1450 (Neuzil and Lyons 2005).\n\nThis type is named for the Nine Mile Site in the San Simon Valley excavated by Jack and Vera Mills in the 1940s.\n\nPhoenix Polychrome also occurs only in bowls with recurved rims. This type is similar to Nine Mile Polychrome with the difference being that Phoenix Polychrome lacks the band of black on white decoration on the interior of bowls and is instead entirely covered in red slip. As with other types, the exterior of these bowls may have either Gila or Tonto style decoration.\n\nThis type dates to AD 1375-1450 and as the name suggests its distribution centers on the Phoenix basin, but distribution extends east to the Cliff Valley and is extends from the Verde Valley in the north to the Douglas, Arizona area in the south (Neuzil and Lyons 2005).\n\nDinwiddie Polychrome is also defined by bowls with recurved rims and dates to AD 1375-1450. Decoration on this type is restricted to the exterior of vessels with the interior being smudged (Neuzil and Lyons 2005).\n\nDinwiddie Polychrome has a very restricted spatial distribution and may \"not occur west of a line drawn through Kinishba, near Whiteriver, and the Nine Mile site, near Bowie [Arizona]\" (Neuzil and Lyons 2005: 30). In Crown’s 1994 study, although she did not name this type, she noted that Roosevelt Red Ware bowls exhibiting smudged interiors were confined to a limited geographical range.\n\nLos Muertos Polchrome has a long and storied history of recognition without formal description. Neuzil and Lyons (2005) note that archaeologists have noted this type as a variation of Gila Polychrome since 1927. Names under which this type has been known include Gila Polychrome with four colors, Las Colinas Polychrome, Perry Mesa Polychrome, Gila style with red, and Gila Polychrome; Trichrome Variety.\n\nThis type is identified by red paint used in conjunction with black paint in white design fields. Design layout follows either Gila or Tonto styles and so is referred to with reference to either of these varieties. Distribution of this type is limited to the Verde Valley, the Agua Fria-Perry Mesa area, the Lower Salt River Valley, the Middle Gila, the Santa Cruz Flats, and the Tonto Basin (Neuzil and Lyons 2005: 30-31).\n\nCliff White-on-red is also a recurved bowl form of Roosevelt Red Ware. The interior of the vessel is smudged on the interior and the exteriors exhibit the white-on-red decoration. Cliff White-on-red overlaps in distribution with Dinwiddie Polychrome and thus the range appears to be southwestern New Mexico and southeastern Arizona.\n\nSimilar white-on-red types exist in the Southwest, although all show sufficient differences for Cliff White-on-red to hold up as a distinct type. This type is different from Gila White-on-red in that Cliff White-on-red is thinned by scraping rather than paddle-and-anvil, and designs are broader than those found on Gila White-on-red. Unlike Cliff White-on-red, Salado White-on-red is white decoration on a red-slipped obliterated corrugated body. Finally, Tularosa White-on-red is most similar to Cliff White-on-red with a smudged interior and a recurved rim form. The differences are that Tularosa White-on-red has two to four coils around the neck and thinner lines used in the designs. (Neuzil and Lyons 2005)\n\nIn their exhaustive study of Casas Grandes, DiPeso, Rinaldo and Fenner (1974), the type Escondida Polychrome was formally named. While not officially a Roosevelt Red Ware, this type exhibits hallmark traits of these types. Escondida Polychrome is produced with locally available clay, a buff firing clay used for types such as Ramos Polychrome, and has black and red designs with many motifs being similar to those found on Roosevelt Red Wares. This type does lack the white slip found on Roosevelt Red Ware, and designs show influence from Chihuahuan types. Escondida Polychrome may be a hybrid type taking aspects of both Roosevelt Red Wares and Chihuahuan wares and being locally produced in northern Mexico.\n\nA second type, unnamed yet, is similar to Escondida Polychrome but exhibits the white slip found on Roosevelt Red Ware. Fenner (personal communication) feels that these vessels are most likely locally produced Roosevelt Red Wares and as such would be found under one of the above headings, although sherds would exhibit the buff-colored paste found in the region.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37732644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37732644", "title": "Sawdust carpet", "text": "Sawdust carpet\n\nSawdust carpets () are one or more layers of colored sawdust, and sometimes other additional materials, laid on the ground as decoration. Sawdust carpets are traditionally created to greet a religious procession that walks over them. The tradition of decorating streets in this fashion began in Europe and was brought to the Americas by the Spanish. The tradition is still found in Mexico, Central America, parts of South America and parts of the United States, but it is strongest in Mexico and Central America.\n\nThe most traditional use of these carpets is for processions related to Holy Week in Mexico and Central America (especially in Sutiaba, León, Nicaragua and Antigua Guatemala) and Corpus Christi in the United States. In Mexico, their use has been extended to processions dedicated to patron saints, especially in Huamantla, Tlaxcala and Huajuapan de León, Oaxaca as well as to Day of the Dead, especially in central Mexico.\n\nTraditional carpets in Mexico and Central America are done with colored and uncolored sawdust; however, various other materials are used with it and sometimes in place of it. These include flowers and flower petals, pine needles, rice, fruit, colored earth, ashes and other usually organic materials. The sawdust is cleaned, soaked in water with dye then set out to dry. In the past natural dyes such as indigo, almond shells etc. were used but today most use commercial dyes. The finer and more compact the sawdust the smoother the finished work.\n\nMost traditional carpets begin with a layer of undyed sawdust spread in a wood frame to smooth out rough surfaces such as stone paved streets and then sprayed with a light coating of water. Sometimes other materials such as sand are used for the base. Then the designs are laid over top. On smooth streets and other surfaces, the design can be drawn in chalk and filled in with the coloring materials. There are two ways to create the design, with the use of molds or stencils and freehand, sprinkling and placing the colored material. Freehand takes longer and requires more skill with the use of molds allowing for very defined and complicated designs. After the carpet is finished, it received a very light spray of water to affix the sawdust in place and keep the colors from fading.\n\nThe tradition has its origins for the feast of Corpus Christi in Santa Cruz de Tenerife. There the streets were adorned with flowers and sand, becoming more elaborate over the Middle Ages. The making of the carpets was then extended to Good Friday with images related to that day, Christ on the Cross and a grieving Virgin Mary. The Spanish brought the custom to Latin America and it was established during the colonial period as part of Holy Week celebration, especially to welcome Good Friday and Easter processions of religious icons carried through the streets. One of the reasons these were promoted was didactic, with the images telling the story of the Passion of Christ and other scenes from his life. They were accepted by the indigenous populations especially in Mexico and parts of Guatemala as it was similar to traditions of laying fruit in honor of the gods of the harvest and carpets made from feathers of exotic birds such as hummingbirds, macaws and quetzals.\n\nToday, the making of sawdust carpets is found in Mexico, various Central American countries Honduras, Brazil and Peru . The carpets are made in some Catholic parishes especially US Southwest. In Corpus Christi, Texas, the tradition was brought by Holy Ghost Fathers arriving from Germany. Due to concerns about preserving the tradition, in Nicaragua in 2000, a technique to create permanent designs in sawdust was created. Exhibitions of these permanent works have been held in Sutiaba, Managua and Antigua Guatemala. These have been created with both religious and secular motifs such as landscapes and still lifes. In 2011 the Honduran Embassy in the United States held an exhibition of various carpets at an event to commemorate Holy Week.\n\nTraditionally the sawdust afterwards is burned or thrown in rivers which causes environmental problems. For this reason some organizations adopt alternatives to sawdust. One example of this is students from Colegio Cedros Norte in Mexico City, who make the carpets for Corpus Christi using grass mats and flower petals, which is more biodegradable.\n\nThe largest event which features sawdust carpets in Mexico is in Huamantla, Tlaxcala. The carpets are part of the Feria de Huamantla which extend over the month of August. All month the artisans create carpets in the atrium of the Basilica, the sanctuary of the city’s most important image the Nuestra Señora de la Caridad (Our Lady of Charity). Each of these are about forty m2 and change each day, and dedicated to the Virgin Mary image. However, the most important events occurs from 14 to 15 August. Since 1941, Nuestra Señora de la Caridad leaves its sanctuary in a procession that wanders for eight km around the streets of the city. The entire procession route is covered in carpets made of sawdust and other materials. The carpets are created the night before during what is called “La noche que nadie duerme” (The night no one sleeps) then trampled by the procession of the image in the early morning hours of the 15th. The carpets are organized and made by committees organized by the various neighborhoods. The procession and the carpets draw about 300,000 visitors each year.\n\nThe making of these sawdust carpets have led to the town and some of its artisans being more widely known. One noted creator from Huamantla is Efrén Chacón, who not only participates in Huamantla each year, but has also traveled all over Mexico and to countries such as Spain, Italy, Canada and Japan to give exhibitions and talks. His work with the carpets earned Efren Chacon a chance to meet Pope John Paul II when he and 222 other artisans worked to create a carpet with the image of the Pope with the Virgin Mary using sawdust and flowers. He has received recognition for his work from Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Italy, El Salvador, Guatemala and the United States. In 2008, artisans in Huamantla also created a carpet 150 meters long and six meters wide with a design to honor the United Nations for its 63rd anniversary.\n\nThe tradition of making these carpets for patron saint processions has spread to other areas of Mexico. They are now made in the city of Tlaxcala for the procession of the Virgin Mary image of Octolán, and for the feast of the Apostle Peter on 29 June in San Pedro Xalostoc, near Ecatepec, State of Mexico . Huajuapan de León creates carpets for the procession of the Señor de los Corazones, a black Christ figure, on 24 July which extend over five kilometers on the city’s streets. Although the tradition was adopted from that of Huamantla, Huajuapan since has developed its own characteristics such as the designs on the carpet. These include Mixtec fretwork, images from pre Hispanic codices and regional color schemes. The event draws over 10,000 visitors along the procession route.\n\nThe tradition of making carpets with sawdust and other materials has since been extended to include Day of the Dead in Mexico, especially for large institutional altars called ofrendas and ofrendas to honor important people such as a one for writer Carlos Fuentes who died in 2012. Day of the Dead carpets can accompany a traditional ofrenda on a table or can be the entire ofrenda. These are most commonly made in the central part of Mexico. In Azcapotzalco in Mexico City, large carpets are made with sawdust along with marigold petals, corn, salt and candles for Day of the Dead. These include many made by primary school children. Since 2007 carpets dedicated to Day of the Dead are made in Guanajuato, for the festival \"El Tapete de la Muerte\". However, the tradition has spread as far south as Teotitlán de Flores Magón, Oaxaca where they are made to honor the saints and Cancún as part of their Day of the Dead festivities. They have been created as far north as Monterrey, where one large carpet/ofrenda surrounded by 300 candles was made to commemorate the victims of a massacre at the city’s Casino Royale .\n\nIn Central America, two noted events that feature the carpets is the community of Sutiaba in the municipality of León, Nicaragua and in Antigua Guatemala, both of which maintain the original purpose of use during Holy Week. Sutiaba is an indigenous community whose tradition dates back at least to 19th century according to written record. The carpets are made on what is called the Calle de Las Alfombras (Street of the Carpets) in the indigenous community of Sutiaba, meters from the San Juan de Dios de Sutiaba church. The carpets are created between Monday and Friday during Holy Week for the Good Friday procession. Each section takes about five to six hours with two to six people working on it depending on the complexity. Nicaraguan artist Federico Quezada has worked to preserve the sawdust carpet traditions of Sutiaba.\n\nAnother area famous for its carpets is Antigua Guatemala as it has mixed Catholic and indigenous images since the colonial period. Antigua Guatemala carpets are generally made using molds with allegoric designs, religious symbols, Biblical scenes, geometric shapes and floral designs with entire families working together using sawdust, pine needles, fruit, flowers, sand and cut paper. The carpets and processions in Antigua, Guatemala draw about 200,000 tourists from the country and abroad.\n\nIn Catalonia, a similar tradition is called the Festa de les Enramades d'Arbúcies (Feast of the Bowers) related to Corpus Christi, which was declared a national heritage in 1999. The tradition has been traced as far back as 1589. The Feast of the Bowers is eight days of festivities along with preparation days before when people collect large quantities of flowers and other materials to make carpets for the streets alone with tree branches. The color is mostly provided by the flowers. The elaborate decorations are then walked over by a parade of floats and other festive elements.\n"}
{"id": "4348260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4348260", "title": "Sheilas' Wheels", "text": "Sheilas' Wheels\n\nSheilas' Wheels is a car insurance brand based in the United Kingdom that targets its insurance to women. The brand was launched in October 2005 by Peter Wood, and is part of Esure, the insurance group he founded with HBOS in 1999. The brand has achieved fame through its advertising featuring three Sheilas clad in pink sequinned dresses who sing a variety of jingles promoting Sheilas’ Wheels (e.g. “For bonzer car insurance deals, girls get onto Sheilas’ Wheels”), often from the seats of a bubblegum pink convertible – sometimes referred to as “The Sheilamobile”.\n\nSheilas’ Wheels and the three Sheilas themselves have been the subject of much media attention, and have regularly featured in polls of irritating but effective advertising. In one of the early adverts set in an Australian outback bar, Joe Scully (Shane Connor) of \"Neighbours\" can be seen.\n\nThe Sheilas themselves are all accomplished singers and performers who began performing as The Sheilas during 2006 at gigs in the United Kingdom – often at gay clubs and student venues – they are Cathi Ogden, Carly Romain and Emma Robbins. Ogden is the only true Australian of the three; Robbins is sister to Ted Robbins, Amy Robbins and Kate Robbins, and is married to Simon Shelton who plays Tinky Winky in the \"Teletubbies\", and is a second cousin of Paul McCartney.\n\nIn the television adverts, the girls usually appear with Romain on the left, Ogden centre and Robbins on the right (with dark hair).\n\nSince their launch, the Sheilas’ Wheels adverts have grown over one hundred video tributes, parodies and imitations on YouTube, including a song by the Amateur Transplants.\n\nThe Sheilas’ Wheels car in the advert is a ‘shell’ and not a working car. It was created by heavily adapting the body of an old American car. There is a second working car, which is similar to the one in the advert that is used for promotional purposes. It is a 1957 Ford Mercury Monterey convertible that the company bought in 2007 on eBay and restored. The car lives in a warehouse of a specialist company in Surrey, who rent out and sometimes sell American vehicles. \n\nThe music for the Sheilas’ Wheels adverts was composed by John Altman, arranged by Jeff Wayne Music and sung by Cathi Ogden, Carly Romain and Emma Robbins.\n\nIn October 2007, The Sheilas released a single, (I’m So) Happy Happy (You’re Mine), produced by Stock, Aitken and Waterman with Ogden doing the lead vocal on this recording. Unfortunately, the single only peaked at number 91, this despite having an accompanied video for the song.\n\nThe brand was originally conceived by copywriter Chris Wilkins and his creative partner and wife, Sian Vickers. The two had previously worked with Peter Wood during the 1990s. Wilkins was the copywriter of the famous advert by Cadbury's, Smash Martians, which is often cited among the most memorable adverts of all time.\n\nThe Sheilas' Wheels car insurance product introduced a number of female focused benefits that differentiated it from competitors, such as enhanced cover for handbags in cars, female friendly repairers and a free counselling service with its comprehensive cover.\n\nIn February 2007, Sheilas' Wheels ran a competition for members of the public to appear in their television adverts, \"Make Me a Sheila Star\", which attracted over 11,000 applicants including babies, boys, girls, men and women, with the youngest being 18 months, and the oldest 98. In the end, thirty members of the public appeared in two adverts: one featuring a twelve person pyramid of women on the back of the Sheilamobile, and one featuring them in a stretched version.\n\nIn January 2008, Sheilas' Wheels began sponsoring the ITV National Weather, with a series of clips showing the Sheilas in a variety of weather conditions. Prior to sponsorship by Sheilas' Wheels, the ITV National Weather had been sponsored by E.ON (formerly Powergen) for eighteen years – the longest running sponsorship deal in television history in the United Kingdom (as well as the first).\n\nIn March 2011, a European Court of Justice ruling stated that price discrimination based on gender breaches EU rules on equality. A spokesman from Sheilas' Wheels parent company Esure stated that \"premiums will rise drastically for young female drivers.\"\n"}

Austin's underwater wheelchair has been seen by more than 150 million people worldwide. Austin lives in Devon, south west England.\n\nAustin studied BSc Hons. Psychology at the University College of Swansea, University of Wales, completing her degree in 1987. She later studied for a BA in Fine Art at the University of Plymouth, before going on to complete a Fine Art MA from the same institution in 2014.\n\nIn 1996, she began using a wheelchair after an extended illness limited her mobility. She trained as a disabled diver in 2005, and has certifications from the Professional Association of Diving Instructors.\n\nAustin has said her artistic practice considers \"the effects of a 'medical' model of disability when compared with writings on the Social Model\". The photographer Norman Lomax, who captured images of Austin in Sharm el-Sheikh in the Red Sea, told \"The Independent\": \"As a photographer, the best stories are of ordinary people doing extraordinary things – that's what I saw here.\" He added: \"It looked like an extraordinary underwater ballet. It also broke down a deeply engrained perception that I had of disability that I think a lot of us share.\" Channel 4 News' Culture Editor, Matthew Cain said of Austin's \"Creating the Spectacle!\": \"Despite its title, this piece of work isn't just about creating a spectacle, it's also about changing perceptions and challenging us to think of the NHS wheelchair not as a symbol of limitation but as a tool for release and freedom.\"\n\nIn 2013 Austin told the BBC's South Today: \"I started wanting to make work around my wheelchair, but what I found was that everyone always interpreted it as if I was trying to say something negative about limitation fear. But for me it’s always been about freedom, it's transformed my life.\" Austin has a patent covering her underwater wheelchair which was granted on 21 August 2013.\n\nExhibitions of Austin's work have been featured at Faith House at Holton Lee, University of Plymouth, Empire Gallery, London, Tate Modern, London and through on the BBC Big Screens and site-specific work in Plymouth City Centre.\n\nAustin has delivered a number of high-profile public presentations about her work.

Originally titled \" The Ambidextrous Universe: Mirror Asymmetry and Time-Reversed Worlds\", subsequent editions are known as \"The New Ambidextrous Universe: Symmetry and Asymmetry from Mirror Reflections to Superstrings\".\n\nThe book begins with the subject of mirror reflection, and from there passes through symmetry in geometry, poetry, art, music, galaxies, suns, planets and living organisms. It then moves down into the molecular scale and looks at how symmetry and asymmetry have evolved from the beginning of life on Earth. There is a chapter on carbon and its versatility and on chirality in biochemistry. Chapter 18 (and subsequent chapters) deals with a conundrum called the Ozma Problem (see below). The second half of the book concerns various aspects of atomic and subatomic physics and how they relate to mirror asymmetry and the related concepts of chirality, antimatter, magnetic and electrical polarity, parity, charge and spin. Time invariance (and reversal) is discussed. Implications for particle physics, theoretical physics and cosmology are covered and brought up to date (in later editions of the book) with regard to GUTs, TOEs, superstring theory and M-theory.\n\nThe 18th chapter, \"The Ozma Problem\", poses a problem that Gardner claims would arise if Earth should ever enter into communication with life on another planet through Project Ozma. This is the problem of how to communicate the meaning of left and right, where the two communicants are conditionally not allowed to view any one object in common. The problem was first implied in Immanuel Kant's discussion of left and right, and William James mentioned it in his chapter on \"The Perception of Space\" in \"The Principles of Psychology\" (1890). It is also mentioned by Charles Howard Hinton. Gardner follows the thread of several false leads on the road to the solution of the Ozma Problem, in each case presenting an apparent solution which, on closer examination, turns out to be a false one.\n\nThe solution to the Ozma Problem was finally embodied in the famous \"Wu experiment\", conducted in 1956 by Chinese-American physicist Chien-Shiung Wu (1912–1997), involving the beta decay of cobalt-60. This experiment was the first to disprove the conservation of parity. At long last, according to Gardner, it is believed that one could carefully describe the Wu experiment to a distant extraterrestrial intelligence and thereby convey the exact meaning of left/right.\n\nW. H. Auden alludes to \"The Ambidextrous Universe\" in his poem \"Josef Weinheber\" (1965).\n\nPale Fire<br>\nIn the original 1964 edition of \"The Ambidextrous Universe\", Gardner quoted two lines of poetry from Vladimir Nabokov's 1962 novel \"Pale Fire\" which are supposed to have been written by a poet, \"John Shade\", who is actually fictional. As a joke, Gardner credited the lines only to Shade and put Shade's name in the index as if he were a real person. In his 1969 novel \"\", Nabokov returned the favor by having the character Van Veen \"quote\" the Gardner book along with the two lines of verse:\n\"Space is a swarming in the eyes, and Time a singing in the ears,\" says John Shade, a modern poet, as quoted by an invented philosopher (\"Martin Gardiner\" ) in \"The Ambidextrous Universe\", page 165 .\n\nLook at the Harlequins!<br>\nNabokov's 1974 novel \"Look at the Harlequins!\", about a man who can't distinguish left from right, was heavily influenced by his reading of \"The Ambidextrous Universe\".\n"}

Mel Gusso said for The New York Times, \"It is diagnostic rather than psychologically probing.\" Another critic said the play was \"a wildly unfocused work that tries to cover too vast a terrain\" and that it contained \"a cornucopia of cliches\".\n\n\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" by William Shakespeare staged at the Barrow Group Theater in Manhattan, was the first play by TBTB to feature a character in a wheelchair:\n\nA note in the theater program said, \"Increasingly we feel we must include all disabled people [rather than blind people only] in our work.\" To reflect this shift in thought and philosophy, 2008 saw the company changing its name from Theater By The Blind to Theater Breaking Through Barriers. Productions, such as Romeo & Juliet, closely followed featuring an actor, Gregg Mozgala, with Cerebral Palsy, their first in a subsequent line of productions incorporating actors with various disabilities.\n"}

Shows traditionally include improvisation, sketch comedy, drama, films, live music, adaptations, musicals, dances, and duologues. Other forms of performance have been featured as well.\n\nTheatre Rice, the first modern Asian American theatre group at Berkeley, was started in the autumn of 1998. Since its conception, Theatre Rice has grown considerably, both artistically and physically. In the past several years, the group has begun to attract an increasingly larger audience and a greater membership. Theatre Rice has emerged from a relatively unknown group to a group whose performances have become an anticipated community event.\n\nTheatre Rice was conceived to provide people (particularly, but not exclusively, Asian Americans) who might not otherwise have a chance to participate in theatrical arts the opportunity to act, write, sing, direct, dance, and learn behind-the-stage techniques. What sets Theatre Rice apart from other dramatic groups is its open and unintimidating environment, and the basic ethic that effort and commitment are more important than experience or innate talent. Because the group contains both seasoned and fledgling actors, there exists a healthy dynamic within which members can share their experiences and learn from each other.\n\nThe Asian American aspect of Theatre Rice is important because it is a step towards combating the misrepresentation, as well as the lack of representation, of the Asian American community in popular culture. By its mere existence, Theatre Rice is fulfilling its purpose of putting forth ideas that stem from the minds of Asian Americans, and therefore addressing the Asian American population as well as the greater community within Berkeley and beyond.\n\nA percentage of every show's profits goes to a charity or nonprofit organization, selected out of a pool of organizations usually submitted by the cast and alumni. Organizations have traditionally been associated with Asian American and performing arts communities, such as the Asian American Theater Company, the API Youth Promoting Advocacy and Leadership, Youth For Asian Theatre, and the National Asian Women's Health Organization. More recent donations include Theatre Rhinoceros, the Japanese Red Cross in the aftermath of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Direct Relief International to help Hurricane Sandy survivors, and St. Baldrick's Foundation.\n\nTheatre Rice was voted Best On-Campus Acting Group by the Daily Cal's Best of Berkeley 2009 and Best Performance Group in the Best of Berkeley 2011.\n\nFall 2014 Showcase Show - Adventure Awaits\nFall 2014 Midsemester Show - Rated TR\nSpring 2014 Showcase Show - What If\nSpring 2014 Midsemester Show - Questionable Life Choices\nFall 2013 Showcase Show - Fancy That\nFall 2013 Midsemester Show - License Revoked\nSpring 2013 Showcase Show - Seal of Approval\n\nSpring 2013 Midsemester Show - Uncommon Sense\n\nFall 2012 Showcase - Error 404\n\nFall 2012 Midsemester Show - High Voltage\n\nSpring 2012 Showcase Show - Challenge Accepted\n\nSpring 2012 Midsemester Show - Occupie\n\nFall 2011 Showcase Show\n\nFall 2011 Midsemester Show - Spellcheck\n\nSpring 2011 Showcase - Don't Touch That!\n\nSpring 2011 Midsemester Show - Instant Gratification!\n\nFall 2010 Showcase - Checkmate!\n\nFall 2010 Midsemester Show - Right Angle\nSpring 2010 Showcase - Aged to Perfection\n\nSpring 2010 Midsemester Show - Spacebar\n\nFall 2009 Showcase - Apocalypse: Later\nFall 2009 Midsemester Show - Local Warming\nSpring 2009 Showcase - Lucky You\nSpring 2009 Midsemester Show - Stimulus Package\n\n"}

Beginning in 1979 he was the president of the \"Centre International pour l'Étude Comparée de Philosophie et d'Esthétique\" and after 1997 of the International Institute of Philosophy. In 1976 he founded the journal \"Aesthetics\".\n\nHe translated Aristotle's \"Poetics\" into Japanese (in 1972) and has written numerous books in Japanese. Imamichi was a supporter of communication between cultures. He characterizes Western philosophy as an attempt to achieve a God's eye view (\"das in-dem-Gott-sein\"; to be in the being of God) and Eastern philosophy as an attempt to be in the world (\"das in-der-Welt-sein\"). Imamichi sees in both stances two incomplete and complementary humanisms, and observes that since the publication of \"The Book of Tea\", some Western philosophers have adopted a more Eastern stance while other Eastern philosophers have attempted to reach the Absolute or the Eternal.\n\nTomonobu Imamichi was the father of guitarist and songwriter Tomotaka Imamichi, pianist Nobuko Kawaguchi, biologist Yukiko Imamichi and psychologist Tomoaki Imamichi.\n\n\n"}

The uber-characters' names are never canon. The term originated in \"\" fandom, coined in 1997 by Kym Taborn, the webmaster of the fansite Whoosh.org. This sort of story was used by the series itself, beginning with the second season episode \"The Xena Scrolls\". A common trend in Xena fanfics was to write Uber stories in which the characters' analogues discover that they are soulmates.\n\n\n\n"}
