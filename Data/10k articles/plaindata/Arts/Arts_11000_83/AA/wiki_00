Through personal interviews, anecdotes and a play, Piya Chatterjee examines the role gender, class, and race play in the production, consumption and circulation of tea. Transcending the realm of local politics and culture, the ethnography reveals the multilayered, multispatial, colonial dimension of gendered labour. She begins by deconstructing the image of the tea box itself to showcase how the image of the exotic tea-plucking women distracts the consumer from the harsh working conditions of plantations. By providing a historical account of the tea industry in India, Chatterjee reveals the intricate link between colonialism and the gendered division of labour in North Bengalese plantations. While gender is her main unit of analysis, Chatterjee explores the way in which colonialism has shaped and continues to shape, the patriarchal and class-based nature of plantations. Coming from a Global South perspective, she demonstrates the intersectionality of gender, class and race, as mutually constitutive mechanisms of oppression. Throughout the novel, she acknowledges her own privilege as a Global South academic and highlights the difficulties of speaking for the subaltern.\n\n\n\nPiya Chatterjee is a historical anthropologist with a current position at the University of California as a Women’s Studies Assistant professor. She self identifies as a post/colonial immigrant women. Born from Indian parents in Nigeria, her family moved to Northern India become immigrating to the United States. She received her PhD. in Anthropology, with a focus on Western Asia, from the University of Chicago in 1994. Academically she describes herself as a “a disciple of Paulo Freire, with a strong postcolonial and antiracist feminist twist.\" She is currently working on a book titled Decolonizing Pedagogies. Her research is focused on the theories of pedagogy and what education means across borders, from her University classroom to villages in post-colonial India. Her future projects include a decolonizing memoir, which she plans to title \"“Going Ape”: Racisms, Violence and Resistance in the US Academy\". Her objective is to develop an ethnographic critique about the cultural and political practices of academia from a postcolonial perspective.\n\n"}
{"id": "42453506", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42453506", "title": "Art of Tuvalu", "text": "Art of Tuvalu\n\nThe Art of Tuvalu has traditionally been expressed in the design of clothing and traditional handicrafts such as the decoration of mats and fans. Tuvaluan clothing was traditionally made from \"Fala\" leaves (Screw Pine or Pandanus).\n\nThe material culture of Tuvalu uses traditional design elements in artifacts used in everyday life such as the design of canoes and fish hooks made from traditional materials. The design of women's skirts (\"titi\") and tops (\"teuga saka\"), that are used in performances of the traditional dance songs of Tuvalu, represents contemporary Tuvaluan art and design.\n\nThe collection of the Museum of New Zealand holds Tuvaluan artifacts and handicraft, including a man's jacket and a Mother Hubbard dress made from pandanus leaves that were made following the impact of Christian missionaries who demanded that the women of Tuvalu adopt more conservative clothing as compared to traditional Tuvaluan clothing.\n\nThe women of Tuvalu use cowrie and other shells in traditional handicrafts decoration of mats, fans and wall hangings that use dyed fibres woven in traditional designs. Crochet (\"kolose\") is one of the art forms practiced by Tuvaluan women.\n\nA traditional headband (\"fau o aliki\") or headdress (\"kula\", \"pale\") made out of pandanus, such as those prepared for the inauguration of a chief (\"aliki\") would follow a specific design and the task of creating the headband or headdress is often reserved to a specific person, such as a daughter of the chief. The traditional floral garland of a young woman (\"Te fou ote tamafine\") or a headdress for a woman (\"fou\") would also follow a specific design using \"tiale\" (gardenia), \"pua\" (guettarda speciosa) and \"melia\" (frangipani).\n\n\"Te titi tao\" is a traditional skirt placed upon another skirt - a \"titi kaulama\" - and tops (\"teuga saka\"), headbands, armbands, and wristbands continue to be used in performances of the tradition dance music of Tuvalu, such as the \"fatele\". The \"fatele\", in its modern form, is performed at community events and to celebrate leaders and other prominent individuals, such as the visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in September 2012.\n\nContemporary dancing skirts (\"titi\") and tops (\"teuga saka\") may still incorporate pandanus leaves, as well as synthetic or natural cloth that is decorated with bold geometric motifs and bold colours. Tuvaluan men also participate in performances of the traditional music in the costumes that follow tradition style that are made from pandanus leaves and synthetic or natural cloth that incorporate bold colours. Marriage ceremonies are usually conducted with men and women in traditional costumes.\n\nIn 1960–1961 Gerd Koch a German anthropologist, visited the atolls of Nanumaga, Nukufetau and Niutao, which resulted in his publication of a book on the material culture of the Ellice Islands, which described, with illustrations, the design of traditional handicrafts and artifacts. Following the change of name to Tuvalu, the English translation by Guy Slatter was published under the title \"The Material Culture of Tuvalu\". Charles Hedley, a naturalist at the Australian Museum, had earlier written the \"General Account of the Atoll of Funafuti\" (1896) which described some uses of the native plants and trees on Funafuti.\n\nThe churches and community buildings that used for wedding celebrations and community activities (the \"falekaupule\" or \"maneapa\") are decorated by the community with the exterior painted with white paint that is known as \"lase\", which is made by burning a large amount of dead coral with firewood. The whitish powder that is the result is mixed with water and painted on the buildings.\n\nArtists with Tuvaluan ancestry in migrant communities, such as the Tuvaluan community in Auckland, New Zealand, produce work using traditional techniques and media and also using modern materials and contemporary Polynesian graphic designs.\n\nSelina Tusitala Marsh, of Sāmoan, Tuvaluan, English and French descent, is a published poet. She represented Tuvalu at the London Olympics Poetry Parnassus event in 2012.\nIn 2015 an exhibition was held on Funafuti of the art of Tuvalu, with works that addressed climate change through the eyes of artists and the display of Kope ote olaga (possessions of life), which was a display of the various artefacts of Tuvalu culture.\n\nVincent Huang (黃瑞芳), a Taiwanese artist, constructed an installation on the reef of Funafuti in 2010 that was designed to raise awareness of the effect of climate change in Tuvalu. He was invited to create the Tuvalu Pavilion at the 2013 Venice Biennale. In 2014 he had an exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Taipei that invited visitors to consider the moral threat climate change presents to Tuvalu. Huang was invited to represent Tuvalu at the 2015 Venice Biennale. He created a turquoise pool crossed by two black walkways. The weight of the people on the walkways results in the pathways sinking into the water causing 'flooding' that symbolically reproduces the impact of global warming on Tuvalu. Huang selected the PVC lining of the pool to reproduce the colour of the \"beautiful crystal blue of the Tuvalu lagoon\".\n\n\n\n"}

The format of an Open House is very similar to an Open Studio, but the significantly lower cost of exhibiting in a residential venue than a studio or gallery provides more artists an opportunity to exhibit their work.\n\nArtists Open Houses are perhaps best known in Brighton and Hove in the UK as taking place alongside the Brighton Festival and Brighton Festival Fringe. \n\nIn 1982 Ned Hoskins filled his home with his and other artists work in protest at the lack of visual arts in the Brighton Festival. \nHoskins had started a new phenomenon. This became the Fiveways Artists Group, named after the area of the city known as Fiveways. They were soon followed by other groupings of Artists' Open Houses in other areas around Brighton and Hove, including Beyond The Level, founded 1996 (from city area The Level) and Kemptown Artists (from city area Kemptown). In 2008 there were around 1000 artists exhibiting work in over 200 houses, divided into 13 trails, together with many independent open houses. \n\nIn 2002 the Artists Open Houses Festival broke away from the official and fringe Brighton Festivals to become an independent organisation, often simplified to just \"AOH\", producing its own brochure and website.\n\nIn Brighton, the Artists Open Houses Festival still runs concurrently with the Brighton Festival and Brighton Festival Fringe. These three organisations, along with many other projects that happen during the three weeks of the festival, work together to create a diverse range of art available for display around the city. \n\nA similar organisation in Cheltenham also runs for a week at the beginning of June. Originally called Cheltenham Artists Open Houses, but now known as Cheltenham Art Festival & Open Studios. \n\nThe Helfa gelf/Art Trail that covers much of North Wales includes many Artists Open Houses amongst its participating studios.\n\nAlso unlinked Artists Open House events happen in other areas of the UK. Bath, Birmingham, Bristol, Leicester, Manchester, Oxford, Peterborough, Stroud, Somerset and Worthing all have ones of their own.\n"}

In 1990, she wrote for \"Brewster Place\", a show produced by Harpo Productions. After this, Oprah Winfrey became a supporter and financial backer on occasion.\n\nIn 1994, she directed the short film \"Tuesday Morning Ride\", which starred Ruby Dee and Bill Cobbs, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film in 1995. She is the first and only African-American woman to be nominated for an Oscar for directing work.\n\nShe has since directed for a variety of TV series, including \"NYPD Blue\" and \"Crossing Jordan\", while continuing in film work. As a screenwriter, she worked on \"Take the Lead\" among other projects.\n\nDianne Houston was born on July 22, 1954, in Washington, D.C. She developed an interest in theater when her mother taught her how to read and write. Trained as an actress, she was very active in the D.C theater circuit. Houston wanted to be a child star. She was deeply disappointed when she failed to gain a role as a Mouseketeer on the Walt Disney TV series \"The Mickey Mouse Club\". In her teens she moved to New York City, but became frustrated with the quality of acting roles available to black women. Houston resumed her education and attended Howard University in northwestern Washington, D.C.\n\nHouston began to write and direct her own plays. Her first play was produced about 1977. She was offered a chance to work with a script owned by Warner Bros. Her input and revision of the script led to other screenwriting assignments. She later worked in New York City, Amsterdam, and Berlin, gaining a screenwriter’s view of a world outside the United States. In 1990, she returned to the United States.\n\nIn that same year, she became executive story editor for an American drama series called \"Brewster Place\", based on Gloria Naylor’s novel, \"The Women of Brewster Place\", which aired on ABC in May 1990, and was filmed entirely in Chicago. The series starred Oprah Winfrey, who also served as co-executive producer, and funded the series with her own production company, Harpo Productions. The series was canceled after a month, but Houston maintained a close friendship with Winfrey, who remained a supporter and, on occasion, became a financial sponsor for some of Houston’s later films.\n\nIn 1992, Houston was the associate producer for a TV film called \"You Must Remember This\", which portrays a highly principled African-American independent filmmaker, played by Robert Guillaume.\n\nIn 1994, Houston created the screen play for \"Override\", a science fiction film based on the short story \"Over the Long Haul\" by Martha Soukup. The film was directed by Danny Glover and starred Lou Diamond Phillips and Emily Lloyd.\n\nHer partnership with Glover was critical because he introduced Houston to the Chanticleer Discovery program, which enables industry professionals to direct their first film. From a pool of 1,000, Houston was one of four chosen. Using the Chanticleer Discovery program's resources, Houston was able to write, direct, and produce her short film titled \"Tuesday Morning Ride\" in 1994.\n\n\"Tuesday Morning Ride\" was based on the short story \"A Summer Tragedy\", by Arna Bontemps, a Harlem Renaissance writer. Set in the 1930s, the story depicts an old man and woman who feel they have nothing to live for, since their children do not visit. They are so depressed that they eventually take themselves over a cliff. Houston’s portrayal of the characters is different. The elderly couple (Bill Cobbs and Ruby Dee) wake up on a Tuesday morning and finish preparing for their last few hours in their home before they have to move into an old people’s home. The couple has everything to live for, but lack a society to do it in. \"Tuesday Morning Ride\" gained Houston a nomination for an Academy Award in the category Best Live Action Short Film in 1995.\n\nAs the Academy Award nominations were announced, it became apparent that Houston was the only one of the 166 nominees who was an African American. Jesse Jackson responded by calling for a boycott of the Academy Awards ceremonies to call attention to what he labeled as \"institutional racism in the Hollywood film industry”.\n\nWhen asked if she was surprised by the nomination for \"Tuesday Morning Ride\", she answered “No”. She had always wanted to be recognized as a director and knew she would need to make an outstanding piece of work that would be Oscar-worthy. She intended to make \"Tuesday Morning Ride\" the film that would get her that recognition. Ironically, because she was the only African American to be nominated that year, her accomplishment as the only African American woman director to be nominated was overlooked. Her nomination did lead, however, to several offers to direct feature films, and she continues to produce, write, and direct films.\n\nIn 1996, with Scott Abbott, Houston co-wrote the TV movie \"Run for the Dream: The Gail Devers Story\". Gail Devers, played by Charlayne Woodard, was one of the best female sprinters in America, who seemed assured a place on the United States Olympic team to compete in the 100-meter hurdles in the Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea, in 1988. Graves' disease prevented her from competing in the Seoul Olympics. Devers underwent radiation treatment for two years but eventually recovered and earned a spot on the U.S. Olympic team for the 1992 games in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nIn 2000 Houston was the executive story editor and director of the television series \"City of Angels\", a medical drama that was broadcast for two seasons on CBS. This show was the network's first medical drama composed of a predominantly African-American cast.\n\nIn 2002 she directed \"NYPD Blue\" a television series set in the 15th police division of New York City. Each week two partners, detectives Andy Sipowicz and John Kelly (later replaced by Bobby Simone), are the central characters in the police drama.\n\nIn 2004 Houston directed the NBC television series \"Crossing Jordan\". Dr. Jordan, played by Jill Hennessy, is a forensic pathologist who tends to be overly passionate about solving homicides and frequently extends her search for answers outside of the autopsy table.\n\nIn 2005 Houston wrote the movie \"Knights of the South Bronx\" with Jamal Joseph. Inspired by a true story, the film portrays Richard Mason (Ted Danson), who is middle-aged and unemployed when he begins teaching in an inner-city school in the Bronx. Instead of following the prescribed curriculum, Mason encourages his elementary school students by teaching them the game of chess.\n\nHer latest movie was \"Take the Lead\", in 2006. This urban drama was inspired by the life of Pierre Dulaine (played by Antonio Banderas), who was a prize-winning ballroom dancer and instructor who volunteered at elementary schools in one of the roughest neighborhoods in the Bronx. Given the tough assignment of a detention class, he teaches the students classical dance, which they mix with hip hop to create an exciting new style.\n\n"}

It is a film type in which, by means of fictional narrative or creative imagination, often improvising, the portrayed characters (natives) play their own roles as members of an ethnic or social group.\n\nJean Rouch is considered to be the father of ethnofiction. An ethnologist, he discovered that a filmmaker interferes with the event he registers. His camera is never a \"candid camera\". The behavior of the portrayed individuals, the natives, will be affected by its presence. Contrary to the principles of Marcel Griaule, his mentor, for Rouch a non-participating camera registering “pure” events in ethnographic research (like filming a ritual without interfering with it) is a pre-concept denied by practice.\n\nAn ethnographer cameraperson, in this view, will be accepted as a natural partner by the actors who play their roles. The cameraperson will be one of them, and may even be possessed by the rhythm of dancers during a ritual celebration and induced in a state of \"cine-trance\". Going further than his predecessors, Jean Rouch introduces the actor as a tool in research.\n\nA new genre was born. Robert Flaherty, a main reference for Rouch, may be seen as the grandfather of this genre, although he was a pure documentary maker and not an ethnographer.\n\nBeing mainly used to refer to ethnographic films as an object of visual anthropology, the term ethnofiction is as well adequate to refer to experimental documentaries preceding and following Rouch's oeuvre and to any fictional creation in human communication, arts or literature, having an ethnographical or social background.\n\nParallel to those of Flaherty or Rouch, ethnic portraits of hard local realities are often drawn in Portuguese films since the thirties, with particular incidence from the sixties to the eighties, and again in the early 21st century. The remote Trás-os-Montes region (see: Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro Province in Portugal), Guinée Bissau or the Cape Vert islands (ancient Portuguese colonies), which step in the limelights from the eighties on thanks to the work of certain directors (Flora Gomes, Pedro Costa, or Daniel E. Thorbecke, the unknown author of Terra Longe ) are themes for pioneering films of this genre, important landmarks in film history.\nArousing fiction in the heart of ethnicity is something current in the Portuguese popular narrative (oral literature): in other words, the traditional attraction for legend and surrealistic imagery in popular arts inspires certain Portuguese films to strip off realistic predicates and become poetical fiction. This practice is common to many fictional films by Manoel de Oliveira and João César Monteiro and to several docufiction hybrids by António Campos, António Reis and Ricardo Costa. Since the 1960s, ethnofiction (local real life and fantasy in one) is a distinctive mark of Portuguese cinema.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14500368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14500368", "title": "Eve Unsell", "text": "Eve Unsell\n\nEve Unsell (December 6, 1879 – July 6, 1937) was an American screenwriter. She wrote for 96 films between 1914 and 1933. She was born in Chicago, Illinois, and died in Hollywood, California. Eve was an American scenarist who was known to also use the pseudonym Oliver W. Geoffreys as well as E.M. Unsell. Eve was married to a man named Lester Blankfield, but the year is disputed. Records list their marriage year as 1911, but it does not match up with other documentation. Eve Unsell was a professional in her career as a scenarist, overcoming many challenges along the way. Eve wrote for over 96 films in her lifetime, and edited over ten. Some of her most famous screen writes turned into productions include \"Shadows\" (1922), \"The Ancient Mariner\" (1925), \"The Plastic Age\" (1925), and \"The Spirit of Youth\" (1929). Although she was most famous for her work in scenario writing she can also be given credit as an adapter, company director, editor, play reader, screenwriter, theatre actress, and writer. She helped in the writing of many novels as long as editing many different pieces from literature to theatrical writing.\n\nUnsell underwent training as a journalist and magazine writer for the \"Kansas City Post\" and graduated from Christian College in Columbia, Missouri. She attended Emerson College in Boston for her postgraduate year, studying literature and drama. The theatrical agent, Beatrice DeMille was so impressed with one of Unsell’s short stories that she hired young Eve as a play reader for her theatrical company in New York. DeMille became a mentor to Eve, giving her the motivation she needed to further her career. Beatrice’s two son’s Cecil and William, partnered with future theatre impresario David Belasco, later took over Beatrice’s company, becoming mentors to Unsell as well. In the article, \"The Rise Of The Continuity Writer,\" featured in \"Writer’s Monthly\", Eve wrote of her mentors, \"Masters of screen technique as the DeMille’s have realized the necessity for not only recruiting the eminent authors for screen ranks but for training young writers to become technicians of screen detail, for the purpose of successfully translating the ‘big ideas’ of the big authors in screen terms, and so, close on the heels of the plot itself.\" This is where she learned plot construction, or what she liked to call it, plot ‘detecting’. Eve gained much experience under the DeMille’s and David Blasco. Blasco, who cast her in the theatrical comedy \"Excuse Me\", gave Unsell two years of on stage experience that would later help in her better understanding of acting and screen writing. It was not until 1913 that Unsell’s hard work in screen writing paid off. That year \"Moving Picture World\" announced that she would sell several film scenarios to the Pathe Freres, and the Kalem Company, who decided to produce Unsell’s scenario, \"The Pawnbroker’s Daughter\".\n\nLater that year Unsell signed a contract with Cecil DeMille and Jesse Lasky for what was then the Famous Players Film Company. The famous news headline \"Eve Unsell Will Sail For England,\" announced that in 1916 Unsell was chosen to be scenario head of the Famous Players-Lasky British Producers Ltd. The company’s aim was \"to feature European locations and to produce the works of the greatest Continental writers.\" Eve liked her office in London, describing it as \"comfortable and cozy.\" However, her heart was in American Pictures. In an interview with \"Motion Pictures News\" she explains, \"English audience is a very critical one. American pictures predominate and are well received.\" The most successful film written by Unsell in her time abroad was \"The Call of Youth\" (1921), a short romance film in which Alfred Hitchcock is credited as a title designer. After the movie was produced in 1921, Unsell moved back to New York to start her own company, Eve Unsell Photoplay Staff, Inc., the only company of its kind at the time headed by a woman.\n\nUnsell was a feminist and in a time when women had little representation in media she made a point to make both her male and female roles equally important in screen writes and other written works. In an article \"From the Studio Angle, The Development Of Screenwriters,\" written by Eve and featured in the \"Writer’s Monthly\", she talks of her stance on men and women representation in screen writing and on screen roles. \"There’s sex in writing,\" she explains. \"Men are generally more successful in working out intricate plots, and supplying the broad sweeps of action, the masculine logic, and proper balance of the subject.\" Women’s roles tend to be different, however just as important. The women \"successfully ‘doctor’ the scenarios, adding little touches that give that emotional values to the dramatic scenes, and the psychology of the character necessary for the ‘popular’ picture.\" Eve defends Eve illuminates how the roles of men and women are brought alive through screen writing and ultimately through pictures and art. The pride she takes in her work is evident through her emphasis on the importance of the storywriter. \"Only the best stories are good enough for the film… the screen needs men and women of vision, to portray life at it’s best… the screen writer must learn the art of substituting action for words.\"\n\nEve Unsell is now one of the 202 women featured in the \"Women Film Pioneers Project,\" an online database that \"showcases women who worked behind-the-scenes in the silent film industry as directors, producers, editors, and more\".\n\n"}

Hollywood is the oldest film industry of the world, and the largest in terms of box office gross revenue. Indian cinema (including Bollywood) is the largest film industry in terms of the number of films produced and the number of tickets sold, with 3.5 billion tickets sold worldwide annually (compared to Hollywood's 2.6 billion tickets sold annually) and 1,986 feature films produced annually.\n\nThe worldwide theatrical market had a box office of in 2016. The top three continents/regions by box office gross were: Asia-Pacific with , the U.S. and Canada with , and Europe, the Middle East and North Africa with . , the largest markets by box office were, in decreasing order, the United States, China, Japan, India, and the United Kingdom. , the countries with the largest number of film productions were India, Nigeria, and the United States. In Europe, significant centers of movie production are France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.\n\nDistinct from the centers are the locations where movies are filmed. Because of labor and infrastructure costs, many films are produced in countries other than the one in which the company which pays for the film is located. For example, many U.S. movies are filmed in Canada, many Nigerian movies are filmed in Ghana, while many Indian movies are filmed in the Americas, Europe, Singapore etc.\n\nThe cinema of the United States, often generally referred to as Hollywood, has had a profound effect on cinema across the world since the early 20th century. The United States cinema (Hollywood) is the oldest film industry in the world which originated more than 121 years ago and also the largest film industry in terms of revenue. Hollywood is the primary nexus of the U.S. film industry with established film study facilities such as the American Film Institute, LA Film School and NYFA being established in the area. However, four of the six major film studios are owned by East Coast companies. The major film studios of Hollywood including Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures and Lightstorm Entertainment are the primary source of the most commercially successful movies in the world, such as \"Star Wars\" (1977), and \"Titanic\" (1997).\n\nAmerican film studios today collectively generate several hundred movies every year, making the United States one of the most prolific producers of films in the world. Only The Walt Disney Company — which owns the Walt Disney Studios — is fully based in Southern California. And while Sony Pictures Entertainment is headquartered in Culver City, California, its parent company, the Sony Corporation, is headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. Most shooting now takes place in California, New York, Louisiana, Georgia and North Carolina. Hollywood is the most popular film industry with the highest number of screens, and is the highest-grossing film industry in the world. Between 2009-2015, Hollywood consistently grossed $10 billion (or more) annually. Hollywood's award ceremony, the Academy Awards, officially known as The Oscars, is held by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) every year and a total of 2,947 Oscars have been awarded since the inception of the award.\n\nThe earliest documented account of an exhibition of projected motion pictures in the United States was in June 1894 in Richmond, Indiana by Charles Francis Jenkins which makes United States cinema the earliest cinema in the whole world. Jenkins used his Phantoscope to project his film before an audience of family, friends and reporters. The film featured a vaudeville dancer performing a Butterfly Dance. Jenkins and his new partner Thomas Armat modified the Phantoscope for exhibitions in temporary theaters at the Cotton States Exposition in the fall of 1895. The Phantoscope was later sold to Thomas Edison, who changed the name of the projector to Edison's Vitascope.\n\nNestor Studios was Hollywood's first movie studio, founded on 27 October 1911. It was built by David Horsley for Nestor Motion Picture Company. It was then owned and operated by David Horsley and his brother, William Horsley. The first motion picture stage in Hollywood was built behind the tavern. Other East Coast studios had moved production to Los Angeles, prior to Nestor's move\nwest. The California weather allowed for year-round filming and the ambitious studio operated three principal divisions under its Canadian-born general manager, Al Christie. Other filmmakers began opening studios in the Hollywood area. The Horsleys operated the Nestor Studios at the Sunset and Gower location until 20 May 1912, when the Universal Studios was formed, headed by Carl Laemmle. Nestor, along with several other motion picture companies, including Laemmle's Independent Moving Pictures (IMP), was merged with Universal.\n\nThe Cinema of China is one of three distinct historical threads of Chinese-language cinema together with the cinema of Hong Kong and the cinema of Taiwan. Cinema was introduced in China in 1896 and the first Chinese film, \"The Battle of Dingjunshan\", was made in 1905, with the film industry being centered on Shanghai in the first decades. China is the home of the largest film studio in the world, the Hengdian World Studios, and in 2010 it had the third largest film industry by number of feature films produced annually. For the next decade the production companies were mainly foreign-owned, and the domestic film industry was centered on Shanghai, a thriving entrepot and the largest city in the Far East. In 1913, the first independent Chinese screenplay, \"The Difficult Couple\", was filmed in Shanghai by Zheng Zhengqiu and Zhang Shichuan.\n\nAs the Sixth Generation gained international exposure, many subsequent movies were joint ventures and projects with international backers, but remained quite resolutely low-key and low budget. Jia's \"Platform\" (2000) was funded in part by Takeshi Kitano's production house, while his \"Still Life\" was shot on HD video. \"Still Life\" was a surprise addition and Golden Lion winner of the 2006 Venice International Film Festival. \"Still Life\", which concerns provincial workers around the Three Gorges region, sharply contrasts with the works of Fifth Generation Chinese directors like Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige who were at the time producing \"House of Flying Daggers\" (2004) and \"The Promise\" (2005). It featured no star of international renown and was acted mostly by non-professionals. In 2012 the country became the second-largest market in the world by box office receipts. In 2014, the gross box office in China was ¥29.6 billion (US$4.82 billion), with domestic films having a share of 55%. The country is predicted to have the largest market in the world in 2017 or 2018. China has also become a major hub of business for Hollywood studios. In 2013, China's gross box office was ¥21.8 billion (US$3.6 billion), the second-largest film market in the world by box office receipts whereas in 2014, China's box office gross was $4.8 Billion, being the second largest box office grosser in film industry.\n\nIndia is the largest producer of films in the world and second oldest film industry in the world which originated around about 105 years ago. In 2009 India produced a total of 2,961 films on celluloid; this figure includes 1,288 feature films. Besides being the largest producer of films in the world, India also has the largest number of admissions. Indian film industry is multi-lingual and the largest in the world in terms of ticket sales but 3rd largest in terms of revenue mainly due to having amongst the lowest ticket prices in the world. The industry is viewed mainly by a vast film-going Indian public, and Indian films have been gaining increasing popularity in the rest of the world—notably in countries with large numbers of expatriate Indians. Indian film industry is also the dominant source of movies and entertainment in its neighboring countries of South Asia. The largest film and most popular industry in India is the Hindi film industry mostly concentrated in Mumbai (Bombay), and is commonly referred to as Bollywood, an amalgamation of Bombay and Hollywood.\n\nThe other largest film industries are Tamil cinema, Telugu cinema, Kannada cinema, Malayalam cinema, Bangla cinema (cinema of West Bengal) and Marathi cinema, which are located in Chennai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Kochi, Kolkata and Mumbai. The remaining majority portion is spread across northern, western, and southern India (with Gujarati, Punjabi, Oriya, Bhojpuri, Assamese Cinema). However, there are several smaller centers of Indian film industries in regional languages centered in the states where those languages are spoken. Indian films are made filled with musicals, action, romance, comedy, and an increasing number of special effects. It encloses a number of several artforms like Indian classical music, folk music of different regions throughout the country, Indian classical dance, folk dance and much more. It is even the place for number of artists from the Indian subcontinent to showcase their talent. The Indian film industry produces more than 1000 films a year. Bollywood is the largest portion of this and is viewed all over the Indian Subcontinent, and is increasingly popular in UK, United States, Australia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, Africa, the Gulf countries, European countries and China. The largest film studio complex in the world is Ramoji Film City located at Hyderabad, India, which opened in 1996 and measures 674 ha (1,666 acres). Comprising 47 sound stages, it has permanent sets ranging from railway stations to temples.\n\nBollywood represents 43% of Indian net box office revenue, while Telugu and Tamil cinema represent 36%, and the rest of the regional cinema constitute 21%, .\n\nThe highest-grossing movie of India is Dangal which is also the 5th highest grossing non-English movie in the world.\n\nThe cinema of Nigeria, often referred to informally as Nollywood, was the second largest film industry, in terms of output, in 2009 and the third largest, in terms of overall revenues generated, in 2013. Its history dates back to as early as the late 19th century and into the colonial era in the early 20th century. The history and development of the Nigerian motion picture industry is sometimes generally classified in four main eras: the Colonial era, Golden Age, Video film era and the emerging New Nigerian cinema.\n\nFilm as a medium first arrived Nigeria in the late 19th century, in the form of peephole viewing of motion picture devices. These were soon replaced in the early 20th century with improved motion picture exhibition devices, with the first set of films screened at the Glover Memorial Hall in Lagos from 12 to 22 August 1903. The earliest feature film made in Nigeria is the 1926 \"Palaver\" produced by Geoffrey Barkas; the film was also the first film ever to feature Nigerian actors in speaking roles. The first film entirely copyrighted to the Nigerian Film unit is \"Fincho\" (1957) by Sam Zebba; which is also the first Nigerian film to be shot in colour.\n\nAfter Nigeria's independence in 1960, the cinema business rapidly expanded, with new cinema houses being established. As a result, Nigerian content in theatres increased in the late 1960s into the 1970s, especially productions from Western Nigeria, owing to former theatre practitioners such as Hubert Ogunde and Moses Olaiya transitioning into the big screen. In 1972, the \"Indigenization Decree\" was issued by Yakubu Gowon, which demands the transfer of ownership of about a total of 300 film theatres from their foreign owners to Nigerians, which resulted in more Nigerians playing active roles in the cinema and film. The oil boom of 1973 through 1978 also contributed immensely to the spontaneous boost of the cinema culture in Nigeria, as the increased purchasing power in Nigeria made a wide range of citizens to have disposable income to spend on cinema going and on home television sets.\n\nAfter the decline of the Golden era, Nigerian film industry experienced a second major boom in the 1990s, supposedly marked by the release of the direct-to-video film \"Living in Bondage\" (1992); the industry peaked in the mid 2000s to become the second largest film industry in the world in terms of the number of annual film productions, placing it ahead of the United States and behind only India. The films started dominating screens across the African continent and by extension, the Caribbeans and the diaspora, with the movies significantly influencing cultures, and the film actors becoming household names across the continent. The boom also led to a backlash against Nigerian films in several countries, bordering on theories such as the \"Nigerialization of Africa\". Since the mid-2000s, the Nigerian cinema have undergone some restructuring to promote quality and professionalism, with \"The Figurine\" (2009) widely regarded as marking the major turn around of contemporary Nigerian cinema. There has since been a resurgence in the proliferation of cinema establishments, and a steady return of the cinema culture in Nigeria.\n\nThe 2016 film The Wedding Party, directed by Kemi Adetiba, is the highest grossing Nollywood film of all time.\n\nSince 1976, Cairo has held the annual Cairo International Film Festival (CIFF), which is accredited by the International Federation of Film Producers Association. In 1996, the Egyptian Media Production City (EMPC) was inaugurated in 6th of October City south of Cairo, although by 2001, only one of 29 planned studios was operational. Censorship, formerly an obstacle to freedom of expression, has decreased remarkably by 2012, when the Egyptian cinema had begun to tackle boldly issues ranging from sexual issues to heavy government criticism.\n\nThe 1940s, 1950s and the 1960s are generally considered the golden age of Egyptian cinema. As in the West, films responded to the popular imagination, with most falling into predictable genres (happy endings being the norm), and many actors making careers out of playing strongly typed parts. In the words of one critic, \"If an Egyptian film intended for popular audiences lacked any of these prerequisites, it constituted a betrayal of the unwritten contract with the spectator, the results of which would manifest themselves in the box office.\" Since the 1990s, Egypt's cinema has gone in separate directions. Smaller art films attract some international attention but sparse attendance at home. Popular films, often broad comedies such as \"What A Lie!\", and the extremely profitable works of comedian Mohamed Saad, battle to hold audiences either drawn to Western films or, increasingly, wary of the perceived immorality of film.\n\nThe cinema of Iran (Persian: \"سینمای ایران\") or cinema of Persia refers to the cinema and film industries in Iran which produce a variety of commercial films annually. Iranian art films have garnered international fame and now enjoy a global following.\n\nAlong with China, Iran has been lauded as one of the best exporters of cinema in the 1990s. Some critics now rank Iran as the world's most important national cinema, artistically, with a significance that invites comparison to Italian neorealism and similar movements in past decades. A range of international film festivals have honored Iranian cinema in the last twenty years. Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke and German filmmaker Werner Herzog have praised Iranian cinema as one of the world's most important artistic cinemas.\n\nSee Cinema of Japan\n\nThe term \"cinema of Korea\" (or \"Korean cinema\") encompasses the motion picture industries of North and South Korea. As with all aspects of Korean life during the past century, the film industry has often been at the mercy of political events, from the late Joseon dynasty to the Korean War to domestic governmental interference. While both countries have relatively robust film industries today, only South Korean films have achieved wide international acclaim. North Korean films tend to portray their communist or revolutionary themes.\n\nSouth Korean films enjoyed a \"Golden age\" during the late 1950s, and 1960s, but by the 1970s had become generally considered to be of low quality. Nonetheless, by 2005 South Korea had become one of few nations to watch more domestic than imported films in theatres due largely to laws placing limits on the number of foreign films able to be shown per theatre per year. In the theaters, Korean films must be played for 73 days per year since 2006. On cable TV 25% domestic film quota will be reduced to 20% after KOR-US FTA.\nThe cinema of South Korea had a total box office gross in the country in 2015 of ₩ and had 113,000,000 admissions, 52% of the total admissions.\n\nHong Kong is a filmmaking hub for the Chinese-speaking world (including the worldwide diaspora) and East Asia in general. For decades it was the third largest motion picture industry in the world (after Bollywood and Hollywood) and the second largest exporter of films. Despite an industry crisis starting in the mid-1990s and Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty in July 1997 Hong Kong film has retained much of its distinctive identity and continues to play a prominent part on the world cinema stage.\nUnlike many film industries, Hong Kong has enjoyed little to no direct government support, through either subsidies or import quotas. It has always been a thoroughly commercial cinema, concentrating on crowd-pleasing genres, like comedy and action, and heavily reliant on formulas, sequels and remakes. Typically of commercial cinemas, its heart is a highly developed star system, which in this case also features substantial overlap with the pop music industry.\n\nThe Yeşilçam film industry is the second largest European theatrical growth market and the 7th largest theatrical market in terms of admissions, only superseded by the ‘big 5’ EU markets and the Russian Federation. The Turkish film market also stands out in the pan-European landscape as the only market where national films regularly outperform US films. It had 1.2 million number of admissions in film industry and 87 feature films were released in the year 2013. Because of the exceptional box office success of Turkish films on the domestic market, the estimated 12.9 million admissions generated on non-national European markets only account for 7% of total admissions to Turkish films in Europe (including Turkey) between 2004 and 2013. This is the third lowest share among the 30 European markets for which such data are available and clearly illustrates the strong dependence of Turkish films on the domestic market, a feature which is shared by Polish and Russian films.\n\nOver the past ten years an increasing number of Turkish films and filmmakers have been selected for international film festivals and received a large number of awards, like Kış Uykusu (Winter's Sleep) won Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Film in 2014. In terms of box office Turkey still ranks behind the Netherlands with just over EUR 200 million as Europe's eight largest box office market ahead of Sweden and Switzerland with a clear gap to the top 6 markets all of which registered GBO between EUR 504 million (Spain) up to over EUR 1 billion in France, the UK, Germany and the Russian Federation. Cinema going is comparatively cheap in Turkey. In 2013 a cinema ticket cost on average EUR 4.0 in Turkey, and this is estimated to be the lowest average ticket price - measured in Euro - in Europe, marginally cheaper than in several Central and Eastern European markets like Croatia, Romania, Lithuania or Bulgaria. When comparing ticket prices in Euro, one of course has to take into consideration that these comparisons are significantly affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates of the various currencies. Because of devaluation of the Turkish Lira against the Euro, average ticket prices measured in Euro remained fairly stable over the past 10 years.\n\nThe cinema of Pakistan, or simply, Pakistani cinema () refers to Pakistan's film industry. Most of the feature films shot in Pakistan are in Urdu, the national language, but may also include films in English, the official language, and regional languages such as Punjabi, Pashto, Balochi, and Sindhi. Lahore has been described as the epicentre of Pakistani cinema, giving rise to the term \"Lollywood.\"\n\nBefore the separation of Bangladesh, Pakistan had three main film production centres: Lahore, Karachi and Dhaka. The regime of Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, VCRs, film piracy, the introduction of entertainment taxes, strict laws based upon ultra-conservative jurisprudence, was an obstacle to the industry's growth. Once thriving, the cinema in Pakistan had a sudden collapse in the 1980s and by the 2000s \"an industry that once produced an average of 80 films annually was now struggling to even churn out more than two films a year.\". However, the industry has recently made a dramatic and remarkable comeback, evident from the fact that 18 of the 21 highest grossing Pakistani movies were released from 2013 through to the present, with Pakistani films frequently outcompeting Bollywood movies for the Pakistani audience, the industry is supported by Pakistani channels such as ARY and Geo whose entertainment divisions have invested significantly in Pakistani cinema when expanding from providing news and entertainment on TV channels, the lifting of strict regulations on production of films and reduction of taxes on cinemas helped to fuel an expansion across the industry from which the film industry has seen a revival.\n\nThe cinema of Bangladesh is the Bengali language film industry based in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The industry often has been a significant film industry since the early 1970s. The word \"Dhallywood\" is a portmanteau of the words Dhaka and Hollywood. The dominant style of Bangladeshi cinema is Melodramatic cinema, which developed from 1947 to 1990 and characterizes most films to this day. Cinema was introduced in Bangladesh in 1898 by Bradford Bioscope Company, credited to have arranged the first film release in Bangladesh. Between 1913 and 1914, the first production company named Picture House was opened. A short silent film titled \"Sukumari\" (\"The Good Girl\") was the first produced film in the region during 1928. The first full-length film \"The Last Kiss\", was released in 1931. From the separation of Bangladesh from Pakistan, Dhaka is the center of Bangladeshi film industry, and generated the majority share of revenue, production and audiences. The 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and the first half of the 1990s were the golden years for Bangladeshi films as the industry produced many successful films. \"The Face and the Mask\", the first Bengali language Bangladeshi full-length feature film was produced in 1956.\n\nDirectors such as Fateh Lohani, Zahir Raihan, Alamgir Kabir, Khan Ataur Rahman, Subhash Dutta, Ritwik Ghatak, Ehtesham, Chashi Nazrul Islam, Abdullah al Mamun, Sheikh Niamat Ali, Gazi Mazharul Anwar, Tanvir Mokammel, Tareque Masud, Morshedul Islam, Humayun Ahmed, Gias Uddin Selim, Amitabh Reza Chowdhury and others have made significant contributions to Bangladeshi mainstream cinema, parallel cinema, art films and won global acclaim.\n\nThe biggest film studios in Southeast Asia has been soft opened on 5 November 2011 on 10 hectares of land in Nongsa, Batam Island, Indonesia. Infinite Frameworks (IFW) is a Singapore-based company (closed to Batam Island) which is owned by a consortium with 90 percent of it hold by Indonesian businessman and movie producer, Mike Wiluan. In 2010-2011, due to the substantial increase in value added tax applied to foreign films, cinemas no longer had access to many foreign films, including Oscar-winning films. Foreign films include major box offices from the west, and other major film producers of the world. This has caused a massive ripple effect on the country's economy. It is assumed that this increases the purchase of unlicensed DVDs. However, even copyright violating DVDs took longer to obtain. The minimum cost to view a foreign film not screened locally, was 1 million Rupiah. This is equivalent to US$100, as it includes a plane ticket to Singapore.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago's film sector began emerging in the late fifties to early sixties and by the late seventies, there were a handful of local productions, both feature film and television. The first full-length feature film to be produced in Trinidad and Tobago was “The Right and the Wrong” (1970) by Indian director/writer/producer, Harbance Kumar. The screenplay was written by the Trinidadian playwright, Freddie Kissoon. The rest of the 20th century saw a couple more feature films being made in the country, with “Bim” (1974), being singled out by Bruce Paddington as \"one of the most important films to be produced in Trinidad and Tobago….and one of the classics of Caribbean cinema.” It was one of the first films to feature an almost entirely Trinidadian cast and crew. There was a rise in Trinidadian film production in the 2000s. Movies such as “Ivan the Terrible” (2004), “SistaGod” (2006), “I’m Santana: The Movie” (2012) and “God Loves the Fighter” (2013) were released both locally and internationally. “SistaGod” had its world premiere at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nThe Trinidad and Tobago Film Company is the national agency that was established in 2006 to further development of the film industry. Trinidad and Tobago puts on a number of film festivals which are organized by different committees and organizations. These include the Secondary Schools Short Film Festival and Smartphone Film Festival organized by Trinidad and Tobago Film Company. There is also an annual Trinidad and Tobago Film Festival which runs for two weeks in the latter half of September.\n\nNepali film does not have a very long movie history, but the industry has its own place in the cultural heritage of the country. It is often referred to as 'Nepali Chalchitra' (which translates to \"Nepali movies\" in English). The terms Kollywood and Kallywood are also used, as a portmanteau of \"Kathmandu\" and \"Hollywood\"; \"Kollywood\" however is more frequently used to refer to Tamil cinema.[1] Chhakka Panja has been considered the highest-grossing movie of all time in Nepali Movie Industry and Kohinoor the second highest. Nepali movies has recently begun receiving international acclaim with films such as The Black Hen (2015), Kagbeni (2006) and others. Nepali feature film White Sun (Seto Surya) has bagged the Best Film award at the 27th Singapore International Film Festival (SGIFF)(2016).\n\nThe Film Development Board (FDB) was established by the Government of Nepal for the development and promotion of the Nepali film industry. The Board is a liaison to facilitate the conceptualization, making, distribution and exhibition of Nepali films nationally. The Board attempts to bridge the gap between film entrepreneurship and government bureaucracy. The Board is a balance between the people at large, the government, and the process of film making. It is intended to act as the safeguard of the interests of the people, the watchdog of the government, and the advocate of filmmakers.\n\nThe first feature film to be made was the 1906 Australian silent \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\", an account of the notorious gang led by Ned Kelly that was directed and produced by the Melburnians Dan Barry and Charles Tait. It ran, continuously, for eighty minutes.\n\nIn the early 1910s, the film industry had fully emerged with D.W. Griffith's \"The Birth of a Nation\". Also in the early 1900s motion picture production companies from New York and New Jersey started moving to California because of the good weather and longer days. Although electric lights existed at that time, none were powerful enough to adequately expose film; the best source of illumination for movie production was natural sunlight. Besides the moderate, dry climate, they were also drawn to the state because of its open spaces and wide variety of natural scenery.\n\nThe earliest documented account of an exhibition of projected motion pictures in the United States was in June 1894 in Richmond, Indiana by Charles Francis Jenkins. The first movie studio in the Hollywood area, Nestor Studios, was founded in 1911 by Al Christie for David Horsley in an old building on the northwest corner of Sunset Boulevard and Gower Street. In the same year, another fifteen Independents settled in Hollywood. Hollywood came to be so strongly associated with the film industry that the word \"Hollywood\" came to be used colloquially to refer to the entire industry.\n\nIn 1913 Cecil B. DeMille, in association with Jesse Lasky, leased a barn with studio facilities on the southeast corner of Selma and Vine Streets from the Burns and Revier Studio and Laboratory, which had been established there. DeMille then began production of \"The Squaw Man\" (1914). It became known as the Lasky-DeMille Barn and is currently the location of the Hollywood Heritage Museum.\n\nThe Charlie Chaplin Studios, on the northeast corner of La Brea and De Longpre Avenues just south of Sunset Boulevard, was built in 1917. It has had many owners after 1953, including Kling Studios, which housed production for the \"Superman\" TV series with George Reeves; Red Skelton, who used the sound stages for his CBS TV variety show; and CBS, who filmed the TV series \"Perry Mason\" with Raymond Burr there. It has also been owned by Herb Alpert's A&M Records and Tijuana Brass Enterprises. It is currently The Jim Henson Company, home of the Muppets. In 1969 The Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Board named the studio a historical cultural monument.\n\nThe famous Hollywood Sign originally read \"Hollywoodland.\" It was erected in 1923 to advertise a new housing development in the hills above Hollywood. For several years the sign was left to deteriorate. In 1949 the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce stepped in and offered to remove the last four letters and repair the rest.\n\nThe sign, located at the top of Mount Lee, is now a registered trademark and cannot be used without the permission of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which also manages the venerable Walk of Fame.\n\nThe first Academy Awards presentation ceremony took place on 16 May 1929, during a banquet held in the Blossom Room of the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel on Hollywood Boulevard. Tickets were USD $10.00 and there were 250 people in attendance.\n\nFrom about 1930 five major Hollywood movie studios from all over the Los Angeles area, Paramount, RKO, 20th Century Fox, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Warner Bros., owned large, grand theaters throughout the country for the exhibition of their movies. The period between the years 1927 (the effective end of the silent era) to 1948 is considered the age of the \"Hollywood studio system\", or, in a more common term, the \"Golden Age of Hollywood\". In a landmark 1948 court decision, the Supreme Court ruled that movie studios could not own theaters and play only the movies of their studio and movie stars, thus an era of Hollywood history had unofficially ended. By the mid-1950s, when television proved a profitable enterprise that was here to stay, movie studios started also being used for the production of programming in that medium, which is still the norm today.\n\nBollywood is the Hindi-language film industry based in Mumbai (formerly known as Bombay), Maharashtra, India. The term is often incorrectly used to refer to the whole of Indian cinema; however, it is only a part of the total Indian film industry, which includes other production centres producing films in multiple languages. Bollywood is the largest film producer in India and one of the largest centres of film production in the world.\n\nBollywood is formally referred to as Hindi cinema. Linguistically, Bollywood films tend to use a colloquial dialect of Hindi-Urdu, or Hindustani, mutually intelligible to both Hindi and Urdu speakers, while modern Bollywood films also increasingly incorporate elements of Hinglish.\n\n\"The Wrestlers\" (1899) and \"The Man and His Monkeys\" (1899), directed and produced by Harischandra Sakharam Bhatawdekar (H. S. Bhatavdekar), were the first two films made by Indian filmmakers, which were both short films. He was also the first Indian filmmaker to direct and produce the first documentary and news related film, titled \"The Landing of Sir M.M. Bhownuggree\".\n\n\"Pundalik\" (\"Shree Pundalik\") (1912), by Dadasaheb Torne alias Rama Chandra Gopal, and \"Raja Harishchandra\" (1913), by Dadasaheb Phalke, were the first and second silent feature films respectively made in India. By the 1930s the industry was producing more than 200 films per annum. The first Indian sound film, Ardeshir Irani's \"Alam Ara\" (1931), was a major commercial success. There was clearly a huge market for talkies and musicals; Bollywood and all the regional film industries quickly switched to sound filming. \"Joymoti (1935 film)\" by Jyoti Prasad Agarwalla was the first Indian dubbed film, released in Calcutta on 10 March 1935. Till then, all dialogues of all talkies were had to be recorded at locations during the shooting of the film. Through \"Joymoti (1935 film)\", dubbing technology was successfully introduced to Indian cinema by Assamese filmmaker Jyoti Prasad Agarwalla.\n\nThe 1930s and 1940s were tumultuous times: India was buffeted by the Great Depression, World War II, the Indian independence movement, and the violence of the Partition. Most Bollywood films were unabashedly escapist, but there were also a number of filmmakers who tackled tough social issues, or used the struggle for Indian independence as a backdrop for their plots.\n\nIn 1937 Ardeshir Irani, of \"Alam Ara\" fame, made the first colour film in Hindi, \"Kisan Kanya\". The next year, he made another colour film, a version of \"Mother India\". However, colour did not become a popular feature until the late 1950s. At this time, lavish romantic musicals and melodramas were the staple fare at the cinema.\n\nFollowing India's independence, the period from the late 1940s to the early 1960s is regarded by film historians as the \"Golden Age\" of Hindi cinema. Defining key figures during this time included Raj Kapoor, Guru Dutt, Mehboob Khan, and Dilip Kumar.\n\nThe 1970s was when the name \"Bollywood\" was coined, and when the quintessential conventions of commercial Bollywood films were established. Key to this was the emergence of the masala film genre, which combines elements of multiple genres (action, comedy, romance, drama, melodrama, musical). The masala film was pioneered in the early 1970s by filmmaker Nasir Hussain, along with screenwriter duo Salim-Javed, pioneering the Bollywood blockbuster format.\n\nProfitability of a film studio is crucially dependent on picking the right film projects and involving the right management and creative teams (cast, direction, visual design, score, photography, costume, set design, editing, and many additional specialties), but it also depends heavily on choosing the right scale and approach to film promotion, control over receipts through technologies such as digital rights management (DRM), sophisticated accounting practices, and management of ancillary revenue streams; in the extreme, for a major media franchise centered on film, the film might itself be only one large component of many large contributions to total franchise revenue.\n\nSubstantial revenues might also derive from licensing efforts and other activities centered around the management of intellectual property; for this reason, various national film industries are heavily invested in the politics and legal specifics of multilateral trade agreements. Hollywood is a large enough industry to impact America's net balance of trade, offsetting some of the decline of employment in the manufacturing sector of the American economy since the early 1980s; typical of recent economic trends in first world economies, a large number of manufacturing jobs paying moderate wages are offset by a smaller number of creating jobs paying high wages. As an intellectual property industry, the film industry (along with the software industry) are central to modern globalization.\n\nThe film industry differs from software, however, in functioning primarily as a cultural export. English-language culture is the most globalized of all cultures, despite China and India having internal populations to rival the global English footprint. For this reason, Hollywood is the dominant film industry in globalism and trade. India has both a large film industry and a large, internal English-language culture, though Bollywood has not yet become a center for English-language film exports on a major scale. Films designed for global export tend to be films centered on action rather than dialogue, especially nuanced dialogue which is not fully available to people speaking English as a second language (ESL). Unusually, Japanese Anime has a global audience, though these are sometimes dubbed into English by star-power Hollywood voice actors.\n\nOn the creative side, picking the right projects has traditionally been regarded as high risk. Increasingly the risk is being mitigated with approaches drawn from advanced data analytics, such as using models derived from machine learning (sometimes glorified as AI) to estimate the future revenue of a proposed project.\n\nThe following is a list of the top 15 countries by the number of feature films (fiction, animation and documentary) produced, as determined by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics , unless otherwise noted.\n\n"}
{"id": "21627807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21627807", "title": "Form 696", "text": "Form 696\n\nForm 696 is a risk assessment form which the London Metropolitan Police requests promoters and licensees of events to complete and submit 14 days in advance of an event in 21 London boroughs. Non compliance with this may result in police opposition to event licences being granted. This form has become controversial due to its stipulation that names, stage names, private addresses, and phone numbers of all promoters, DJs and artists be listed. The form also asks for a description of the style of music to be performed and the target audience. The original form asked for details of ethnic groups likely to attend the performance, but that version was revised to omit those parameters in December 2008. In November 2017, the Met Police announced that following a review of how the form was being used it was to be scrapped.\n\nFeargal Sharkey, Head of UK Music and former lead singer of The Undertones, gave evidence to the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee in November 2008 stating that \"We learned that the Metropolitan Police, in conjunction with an organization called London Councils - a representative body for all London borough - at the end of last year jointly wrote to all 33 local London boroughs recommending that they insert some particular wording into their local licensing policy statements.\" He added that the London Borough of Hillingdon in west London, \"tries to make a direct connection not only between crime and disorder and live music, but most astonishingly - I'm still knocked over in disbelief - between live music and the prevention of terrorism.\" Sharkey stated that he would be seeking a Judicial Review on the use of the form and had complained to the Equality and Human Rights Commission about the targeting of musical styles favoured by black and Asian teenagers. According to Sharkey an afternoon school charity concert in a public park had been cancelled because organisers could not supply the details of the young performers.\n\nJon McClure, lead singer with Reverend and the Makers, set up a petition on the UK Prime Minister's website to allow protest against what he alleges as \"racial discrimination\".\n\nIn a statement on their web site, The British Academy of Composers and Songwriters CEO Patrick Rackow stated \"...the imposition of Form 696 on live music is likely to discourage the existence and growth of live music. Music has long been a positive form of free expression, for people from all walks of life to create and enjoy. This form appears to single out certain genres of music and ethnic audiences and therefore the Academy cannot support it.”\n\nIn December 2008, Mike Howlett, Chairman of the Music Producers Guild (UK), wrote to the General Secretary of the Musicians Union \"In keeping with the Musicians Union and UK Music, we feel this is a gross infringement of civil liberties and a form of racial discrimination. We also feel that this will deter the staging of live musical events, stifle free expression and possibly penalise certain genres of music and ethnic audiences. Our members are horrified that this legislation, introduced in 2006, is being enforced under the guise of public law and order. We see no reason why artists and/or venue owners and managers should be forced to comply.\"\n\nDavid Isles, Detective Superintendent of the Metropolitan Police Clubs and Vice unit has stated that Form 696 is not designed to stop people having a good time. The Metropolitan Police web site describes the form as a \"Promotion Event risk assessment form\".\n\nDetective Chief Superintendent Richard Martin stated that the original form, with its questions relating to audience ethnicity \"was removed just because I don't think it added any value to the form... We take account of where the event is playing, what other events might be playing nearby, the type of music that's being played, and whether there have been problems before. We've had quite a few of what I consider 'higher risk events', where there may be some problems - so we recommend additional searching processes and additional security to help manage the event safely.\" \"It's not about being risk averse, it's about managing the risk,\" he said. \"If you're a publican and you are just having some performers to entertain your regular customers, you won't be expected to do a risk assessment. It's for when the performance is being put on to draw people in. We will never assess somebody just on the genre of music they are performing. There is a whole raft of factors that are taken into account.\"\n\nIn September 2009, the Metropolitan Police announced \"that venues would no longer be asked for details of the music style. A requirement to provide the telephone number of the performing artist will also be dropped and an independent \"scrutiny panel\" will be set up to ensure that the form is not misused.\" Feargal Sharkey described this as an \"exercise in semantics\" and called for the form to be completely scrapped. He added that \"it was clear that the altered version continued to target musicians from ethnic minorities and he objected strongly to a question which asks about the 'make-up of the patrons'.\"\n\nOn 10 November 2017, it was announced that the use of Form 696 was to be discontinued in London following a review called for by Mayor of London Sadiq Khan. Reporting the decision, the BBC noted, \"The Met denied the form had been used to target particular genres but said it had decided to drop it after a fall in 'serious incidents' at music events\"; however, the BBC also reported that a Freedom of Information request earlier in 2017 had discovered that 16 other English police forces were using forms similar to Form 696.\n\n"}

In 1976, he was awarded a contract to teach Epistemology at the Faculty of Natural, mathematical and physical sciences of the University of Parma, and obtained a permanent position in the same university two years later. On 28 February 1987 he became a researcher at \"Sapienza\" University of Rome, where, starting from 19 October 1993, he became Associate Professor and, from 1 November 2001, Full Professor of Aesthetics.\nSince November 2012, he has been the Director of MLAC (Museo Laboratorio di Arte Contemporanea/Laboratory Museum of Contemporary Art), \"Sapienza\" University. He is a member of the Teaching Staff of the Ph.D. in Philosophy of the same university, where he also served, for six years, as President of the Master’s Degree of the former Faculty of Philosophy.\nHe has coordinated national research projects (Progetti PRIN) and has taken part in international research projects. Over the last decade, he has coordinated university researches (Ricerche di Ateneo) involving more than thirty scholars from different study areas and focussing on aesthetic-philosophical and literary-artistic topics.\n\nHe edited, with Claudio Zambianchi, the anthology \"Alle origini dell'opera d'arte contemporanea\" (Roma-Bari, Laterza, 2008; 4th ed. 2012)\n\nHe is a founding member of SIE (\"Società Italiana di Estetica/Italian Society of Aesthetics\").\n\nHe is the editor of the book series \"Figure dell'estetica\" of the publishing house Alboversorio (Milan).\n\nHe is a member of the scientific board of the following journals \n\nDi Giacomo is also a member of the scientific board of \"Aesthetica Preprint\", a book series of the \"Centro Internazionale Studi di Estetica\" (\"International Centre for the Study of Aesthetics\").\n\nDi Giacomo maintains that, in order to tackle the issue of the image today, it is necessary to refuse both an interpretation of the image as a mere mirror of things and its interpretation as an exclusively self-referential system of signs. Based on his reading of Wittgenstein, he draws the conclusion that logical representation entails something that manifests itself and, while doing so, remains ‘other’, distinct from the visibility of the representation itself. Thus, in presenting itself, the image manifests the other of the visible, of the representable: that other which reveals itself in the visible, by hiding from it. And this is precisely how the image becomes an icon of the invisible.\n\nHowever, starting from Adorno’s reflection, the image tends to lose its figurative character but, at the same time, it continues to exist; the image is, indeed, both a thing and a non-thing: a paradoxical “real unreality”. This ensues from the attempt to divide the double-edged nature of the image into its constituent elements: on the one hand, a readymade in which the representational dimension melts into a purely presentational dimension, and, on the other hand, a solely mental image endowed with a weak material support.\n\nToday, the images of the new media are images of images and, in this sense, they are not even proper images but simulations, “simulacra”. It is no coincidence that digital images, as reproductions, have a low value as images, because they tend to acquire the aspect of something, thus losing that connection between transparency and opacity which characterises authentic images. Hence, indeed, the question whether new media are able to create real images.\nMore particularly, it is in the kind of art that Adorno defines as “modern” that we find an overcoming of the epiphanic dimension that distinguishes the icon, where the visible is the place of manifestation of the invisible as Absolute. As we have become aware of the impossibility to exhaust the whole of reality and, at the same time, to manifest the Absolute, what emerges now is a conception of the image as something that can be interrogated as a testimony of what does not allow itself to be translated into an image: to testify is indeed to tell what cannot be told completely. In this sense, testimony coincides not with memory, as consistent with what happened, but with the immemorial, which refers to something we can neither remember nor forget completely, that is something that is neither totally speakable nor totally unspeakable.\n\nIn short, a witness only speaks starting from the impossibility to speak. That the image is equivalent to testimony means, then, that the attempt to say the unsayable is an infinite task, and this is why the question of the image forms an integral part of the ethical question. This entails that in the image there is no completeness and, consequently, neither redemption nor reconciliation with the real. From this point of view, to consider the image as testimony is tantamount to seeing it as the place of a perpetually unresolved tension between memory and oblivion, thus as the expression of the imperative of sense in a context, such as the contemporary one, in which both world and art seem to be increasingly abandoned to non-sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "45356779", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45356779", "title": "Jonty Hurwitz", "text": "Jonty Hurwitz\n\nJonty Hurwitz (born 2 September 1969 in Johannesburg) is an artist, engineer and entrepreneur. Hurwitz creates scientifically inspired artworks and anamorphic sculptures. He is recognised for the smallest human form ever created using nano technology.\n\nJonty Hurwitz was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, to Selwin, a hotelier and entrepreneur and Marcia Berger, a drama lecturer and teacher. Jonty spent his early life living in small hotels in rural towns in South Africa while his father built up his business.\n\nJonty studied Electrical Engineering at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg from 1989 to 1993. His major was Signal Processing. He then joined the University of Cape Town Remote Sensing Group as a full-time researcher under Professor Michael Inggs, publishing a paper on radar pattern recognition.\n\nFollowing his research post, Hurwitz traveled for a long period of time in India studying Yoga and wood carving.\n\nIn a 2015, documentary by CNN International on Hurwitz's artwork, BBC Radio 2 art critic Estelle Lovatt commented on Hurwitz's work: \"If Leonardo Da Vinci were alive today, he would have been doing what Jonty is doing. He would have been using algorithms. No one else works like him today. His art is the mix between the emotional and the intelligent, and that's what gives it that spark.\" Hurwitz's work focuses on the aesthetics of art in the context of human perception. His early body of sculpture was discovered by Estelle Lovatt during 2011 in an article for \"Art of England Magazine\": \"Thinning the divide gap between art and science, Hurwitz is cognisant of the two being holistically co-joined in the same way as we are naturally, comfortably split between our spiritual and operational self\".\n\nHurwitz began producing sculptures in 2008. In 2009, his first sculpture 'Yoda and the Anamorph' won the People’s Choice Bentliff Prize of the Maidstone Museum and Art Gallery. Later in 2009 he won the Noble Sculpture Prize and was commissioned to install his first large scale work (a nude study of his father called 'Dietro di me') in the Italian village Colletta di Castelbianco. In 2010, he was selected as a finalist for the 4th International Arte Laguna Prize in Venice, Italy.\n\nIn January 2013, Hurwitz's anamorphic work was described by the art blogger Christopher Jobson. In a short documentary about Hurwitz's \"Generation Pi\" philosophy by \"Vera Productions\" it is estimated that the sculpture received 20 million views online in the space of a few weeks. In early 2013 Hurwitz was introduced to the Savoy Hotel by London art agent Sally Vaughan. Hurwitz was commissioned to be Artist in Residence at the hotel and produce a sculpture of the hotel’s historically iconic Mascot \"Kaspar the Cat\". Hurwitz lived for several months in the hotel producing the sculpture.\n\nIn the same year, Hurwitz was also nominated for the Threadneedle Prize and exhibited a collection at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. By late 2013, in a special edition of Art of England on portraiture, Hurwitz was cited as the #1 portrait artist in the UK. In January 2014 Hurwitz was voted #46 in the top 100 artists of 2013 by the American art site, Empty Kingdom. In the same month, Hurwitz's anamorphic work was blogged as \"The best of 2013\" by the American Art and Culture magazine, Juxtapoz. In 2013 Hurwitz's work was also curated by \"Science Gallery International\" for a touring group show entitled ‘Illusion’ curated by Trinity College Dublin. The show presents a collection of installation artworks from around the world that affect human perception. The exhibition led to a 2014/2015 tour in the USA where it attracted over 170,000 visitors. The show then moved on to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 2015 and Leipzig, Germany in 2016.\n\nIn late 2014, he released a series of “nano sculptures” under the title of ″Trust″. This series of works captured the attentions of both the scientific and art community, being cited by among others, Nature, Scientific American, Popular Science and Phys.org. In 2015, Hurwitz was elected a member of the Royal British Society of Sculptors. In 2016 the Royal Photographic Society selected a Scanning Electron Microscope photograph by Hurwitz and Stefan Diller as one of the top 100 'Royal Society International Images for Science'.\n\nHurwitz has produced a body of work using both oblique (perspective) and catoptric (mirror) anamorphosis. In an interview with Christopher Jobson, Hurwitz explains his anamorphic inspiration as follows: “I have always been torn between art and physics. In a moment of self-doubt in 2008, I wandered into the National Portrait Gallery and stumbled across a strange anamorphic piece by William Scrots, a portrait of Edward VI from 1546. Followed shortly down the aisle by The Ambassadors by Hans Holbein from 1533. My life changed forever. I rushed home and within hours was devouring the works of M. C. Escher, Da Vinci and many more. In a breath I had found “brothers” in a smallish group of artists spanning 500 years with exactly the same dilemma as me. Within two months I was deep in production of my first work. My art rests on the shoulders of giants, and I am grateful to them.” Anamorphosis as a form of art has a long history. A page in Leonardo Da Vinci’s note book (folio 35 verso a of the Codex Atlanticus) shows two strangely elongated sketches of a child's head and an eye. These distorted and hesitant drawings, the first known anamorphoses, from around 1485”. In the mid-18th Century anamorphosis was also used by Jacobite artists to secretly depict images of Bonnie Prince Charlie in the wake of brutal English censorship.\n\nHurwitz is a pioneer in creating catoptric sculpture. Until the creation of his first work \"Rejuvenation\", anamorphic sculptures have not been known to have existed in art history. In his online talks, Hurwitz explains that this is a function of processing power and that whilst painting is possible in a mirror, three dimensional anamorphosis could only have come into being with the advent of powerful computers. Each of his sculptures involves billions of calculations using an algorithm derived from the mathematical constant π. Hurwitz asserts that his art is “contemporary to the millisecond”. Kinetic Art curator and director of the London \"Kinetica Museum\", Dianne Harris, described Hurwitz's art as follows \"The works of polymath Jonty Hurwitz are contemporary trompe l'oeil, at first glance appearing abstract, but in mirrored reflections, representational\".\n\nIn 2014, Hurwitz pioneered a new sculptural technique in the field of Nanoart using multiphoton lithography and photogrammetry to create the world’s smallest human portraits of his first love. The works of art were inspired by the nineteenth century marble sculpture of Cupid and Psyche by Antonio Canova, part of the permanent collection of the Louvre Museum, Paris. Hurwitz’s works are so tiny that they are invisible to the human eye, able to be placed on the forehead of an ant. Smaller details of the works are at approximately the 300 nanometer scale, similar to the wavelengths of visible light and are therefore near impossible by the laws of physics to see in the visible spectrum. The only way to observe these works is through a non-optical method of magnification like a scanning electron microscope. To create these works Hurwitz collaborated with a team of over 20 people, including Stephan Hengsbach of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Yehiam Prior of the Weizmann Institute of Science, an art project centred in the world of academic physics. In February 2015, Hurwitz's sculpture \"Trust\" was awarded the world record for the \"Smallest sculpture of a human\" by the Guinness Book of Records.\n\nIn an interview with Beautiful/Decay Hurwitz explains the philosophy behind the works: “As technology starts to evolve faster than our human perception is able to handle, the line between science and myth becomes blurred. We live in an era where the impossible has finally come to pass. In our own little way we have become demigods of creation in our physical world…. The nano works that I present to you here represent more that just a feat of science though. They represent the moment in history that we ourselves are able to create a full human form at the same scale as the sperm that creates us in order to facilitate the creation.” In an online interview with Slashdot, Hurwitz himself asks the question “How can something you can't see be art?” By basing his work on the myth of Cupid and Psyche he also suggests that our belief in modern science isn't that different from the faith the ancient greeks had in the demigods. The final irony was that the sculptures were destroyed by a touch one week before the images were published on the Internet.\n\nIn the mid-90s, Hurwitz arrived in London following his travels in India and got his first job researching financial data visualization for Gilbert de Botton, Chairman and Founder of Global Asset Management (GAM). During this period, he was exposed to de Botton’s open architecture model of asset management. It was Jonty’s close relationship with de Botton, also a major British art collector, that exposed him to the art world. The two maintained a close friendship until de Botton's death in 2000.\n\nHurwitz left Global Asset Management after two years forming his own company, \"Delve\", to develop the R&D in data visualisation and reporting. Jonty’s main client became de Botton himself. In 1996, GAM launched its financial reporting technology built by Hurwitz, which attracted attention in the financial media, winning several awards. Hurwitz’s newly formed graphics and software team evolved over several years publishing several visualization projects (non-exhaustive list):\n\n\nOver the years from 2000 to 2005, Hurwitz signed up a large base of asset managers for his reporting and analysis technology. In 2005, Hurwitz’s company \"Delve\" was acquired by Alternative Investment Market listed company Statpro Group PLC (SOG). Hurwitz joined Statpro as Creative Director where he designed the first Cloud Computing analytics and risk platform for asset data. In 2008, Statpro launched its flagship product \"Statpro Revolution\" which was the result of this R&D. By 2014, eight out of the top ten largest asset managers in the world were Statpro Clients.\n\nHurwitz was co-founding Chief Technology Officer of Wonga.com in 2007 where he designed and built the first real-time online consumer loan system in the world. During this period, Wonga’s technology won several awards (listed below). By 2011, Wonga had begun to attract criticism and Hurwitz, as the inventor of the technology, found himself with not enough influence to guide the now large company's use of his designs. After several attempts at changing Wonga's strategy, he resigned from his operational role in November 2011, quietly releasing his sculpture entitled \"Co-Founder\".\n\nHurwitz's technology is credited with several innovations in the financial services industry:\n\nHurwitz continues to commit much of his time to fintech startups while at the same time building up his body of artwork. In late 2011 Hurwitz backed Damian Kimmelman, to build a next-generation data provider Duedil. Duedil has since been dubbed \"The Bloomberg of private companies\" and has emerged as one of the key data providers in Europe and the UK. In 2011, Hurwitz seed funded the financial technology startup \"behalf.com\". In 2012, Hurwitz backed the UK startup bank for young people: \"Meet Osper\".\n\n\n\nHurwitz is founder of the Separated Child Foundation which supports unaccompanied refugee children arriving on UK shores.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21875788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21875788", "title": "Keep Calm and Carry On", "text": "Keep Calm and Carry On\n\nKeep Calm and Carry On is a motivational poster produced by the British government in 1939 in preparation for World War II. The poster was intended to raise the morale of the British public, threatened with widely predicted mass air attacks on major cities. Although 2.45 million copies were printed, and although the Blitz did in fact take place, the poster was hardly ever publicly displayed and was little known until a copy was rediscovered in 2000 at Barter Books, a bookshop in Alnwick. It has since been re-issued by a number of private companies, and has been used as the decorative theme for a range of products.\n\nEvocative of the Victorian belief in British stoicism – the \"stiff upper lip\", self-discipline, fortitude, and remaining calm in adversity – the poster has become recognised around the world. It was thought that only two original copies survived until a collection of approximately 15 was brought in to the \"Antiques Roadshow\" in 2012 by the daughter of an ex-Royal Observer Corps member. A few further examples have come to light since.\n\nThe \"Keep Calm and Carry On\" poster was designed by the Ministry of Information during the period of 27 June to 6 July 1939. It was produced as part of a series of three \"Home Publicity\" posters (the others read \"Your \"Courage,\" Your \"Cheerfulness,\" Your \"Resolution Will Bring Us Victory\" and \"Freedom Is in Peril / Defend It With All Your Might\"\"). Each poster showed the slogan under a representation of a \"Tudor Crown\" (a symbol of the state). They were intended to be distributed to strengthen morale in the event of a wartime disaster, such as mass bombing of major cities using high explosives and poison gas, which was widely expected within hours of an outbreak of war.\n\nA career civil servant named A. P. Waterfield came up with \"Your Courage\" as \"a rallying war-cry that will bring out the best in everyone of us and put us in an offensive mood at once\". Others involved in the planning of the early posters included: John Hilton, Professor of Industrial Relations at Cambridge University, responsible overall as Director of Home Publicity; William Surrey Dane, managing director at Odhams Press; Gervas Huxley, former head of publicity for the Empire Marketing Board; William Codling, controller of HMSO; Harold Nicolson, MP; W. G. V. Vaughan, who became Director of the General Production Division (GPD); H. V. Rhodes, who later wrote an occasional paper on setting up a new government department; Ivison Macadam; \"Mr Cruthley\"; and \"Mr Francis\". Ernest Wallcousins was the artist tasked with creating the poster designs. \n\nDetailed planning for the posters had started in April 1939 and the eventual designs were prepared after meetings between officials from the Ministry of Information and HM Treasury on 26 June 1939 and between officials from the Ministry of Information and HMSO on 27 June 1939. Roughs of the poster were completed on 6 July 1939, and the final designs were agreed by the Home Secretary Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood on 4 August 1939. Printing began on 23 August 1939, the day that Nazi Germany and the USSR signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, and the posters were ready to be placed up within 24 hours of the outbreak of war.\n\nThe posters were produced in 11 different sizes, ranging from up to large 48-sheet versions. The background colour was either red or blue. The lettering was probably hand-drawn by Wallcousins: it is similar, but not identical, to humanist sans-serif typefaces such as Gill Sans and Johnston. \n\nAlmost 2,500,000 copies of \"Keep Calm and Carry On\" were printed between 23 August and 3 September 1939 but the poster was not sanctioned for immediate public display. It was instead decided that copies should remain in \"cold storage\" for use after serious air raids (with resources transferred to \"Your Courage\" and \"Freedom is in Peril\"). Copies of \"Keep Calm and Carry On\" were retained until April 1940, but stocks were then pulped as part of the wider Paper Salvage campaign. A very few copies do appear to have been displayed, but such instances were rare and unauthorised: an October 1940 edition of the \"Yorkshire Post\" reports the poster hung in a shop in Leeds; while a photograph discovered in 2016 shows it on the wall of a government laboratory in Bedfordshire.\n\nThe remainder of the Ministry of Information publicity campaign was cancelled in October 1939 following criticism of its cost and impact. Many people claimed not to have seen the posters; while those who did see them regarded them as patronising and divisive. Design historian Susannah Walker regards the campaign as \"a resounding failure\" and reflective of a misjudgement by upper-class civil servants of the mood of the people.\n\nIn late May and early June 1941, 14,000,000 copies of a leaflet entitled \"Beating the Invader\" were distributed with a message from Prime Minister Winston Churchill. The leaflet begins \"If invasion comes...\" and exhorts the populace to \"Stand Firm\" and \"Carry On\". The two phrases do not appear in one sentence, as they applied to different segments of the population depending on their circumstances, with those civilians finding themselves in areas of fighting ordered to stand firm (i.e., stay put) and those not in areas of fighting ordered to carry on (i.e., continue vital war work). Each mandate is identified as a \"great order and duty\" should invasion come. The leaflet then lists 14 questions and answers on practical measures to be taken.\n\nIn 2000, Stuart Manley, co-owner with his wife Mary of Barter Books Ltd. in Alnwick, Northumberland, was sorting through a box of used books bought at auction when he uncovered one of the original \"Keep Calm and Carry On\" posters. The couple framed it and hung it up by the cash register; it attracted so much interest that Manley began to produce and sell copies. In late 2005, \"Guardian\" journalist Susie Steiner featured the replica posters as a Christmas gift suggestion, raising their profile still further. Other companies followed the Manleys' example, and the design rapidly began to be used as the theme for a wide range of products. Mary Manley later commented, \"I didn't want it trivialised; but of course now it's been trivialised beyond belief.\"\n\nIn early 2012, Barter Books debuted an informational short film, \"The Story of Keep Calm and Carry On\", providing visual insight into the modernisation and commercialisation of the design and the phrase.\n\nThe poster has become an evocation of British stoicism: the \"stiff upper lip\", self-discipline, fortitude and remaining calm in adversity. Susannah Walker comments that it is now seen \"not only as a distillation of a crucial moment in Britishness, but also as an inspiring message from the past to the present in a time of crisis\". She goes on to point out, however, that such an interpretation overlooks the circumstances of its production, and the relative failure of the campaign of which it formed a part.\n\nIn August 2011, it was reported that a UK-based company called Keep Calm and Carry On Ltd (managed by entrepreneur Mark Coop) had registered the slogan as a community trade mark in the EU, CTM No: 009455619, and in the United States, No. 4066622, after failing to obtain its registration as a trademark in the United Kingdom. The company issued a take-down request against a seller of \"Keep Calm and Carry On\" products. The company's right to claim the trademark was questioned by, among others, the Manleys of Barter Books, as the slogan had been widely used before registration and was not recognisable as indicating trade origin. An application was submitted by British intellectual property advisor and UK trademarking service Trade Mark Direct to cancel the registration on the grounds that the words were too widely used for one person to own the exclusive rights, but the request for cancellation was rejected and the trade mark is still protected in all EU countries. The company subsequently tried to register the slogan as its trademark in both the United States and Canada.\n\nAs the popularity of the poster in various media has grown, innumerable parodies, imitations and co-optations have also appeared, making it a notable meme. Messages range from the cute to the overtly political, typically with references to other aspects of popular culture raging from Land Rover and Disney to Star Wars and Thomas the Tank Engine. Examples have included \"Now Panic and Freak Out\" (with an upside-down crown), \"Get Excited and Make Things\" (with a crown incorporating spanners), \"Keep Calm and Have a Cupcake\" (with a cupcake icon), \"Don't Panic and Fake a British Accent\", \"Keep Spending and Carry On Shopping\", \"Keep Calm and Don't Sneeze\" during the 2009 swine flu pandemic, \"Keep Calm and Call Batman\" (with the Batman logo), and \"Keep Calm and Switch to Linux\" (with Tux). In March–April 2012, the British pop-rock band McFly undertook a theatre tour entitled \"The Keep Calm and Play Louder Tour\", promoted with a poster closely based on that of 1939. In late 2012 and early 2013, the \"Save Lewisham Hospital\" campaign (a protest against proposed cuts in services at University Hospital Lewisham) made widespread use of a poster with the slogan \"Don't Keep Calm Get Angry and Save Lewisham A&E\". The efforts of Naheed Nenshi, mayor of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, to encourage and motivate his citizens in the wake of the 2013 Alberta floods made him the subject of parody \"Keep Calm and Nenshi On\" fundraising T-shirts.\n\n"}

It stars Uma Thurman as the Bride, who continues her campaign of revenge against the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (Lucy Liu, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah, and Vivica A. Fox) and their leader Bill (David Carradine), who tried to kill her and her unborn child.\n\nTarantino conceived \"Kill Bill\" as a homage to \"grindhouse\" cinema including martial arts films, samurai cinema, blaxploitation films, and spaghetti westerns. It is the second of two \"Kill Bill\" films produced simultaneously; the first, \"\", was released in 2003. The films were originally set for a single release, but the film, with a runtime of over four hours, was divided in two. Like \"Volume 1, Volume 2\" received positive reviews and was a commercial success.\n\nThe pregnant Bride and her groom rehearse their wedding. Bill, the Bride's former lover, the father of her child, and the leader of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, arrives unexpectedly and orders the Deadly Vipers to kill everyone at the wedding. The Bride survives and swears revenge.\n\nFour years later, the Bride has already assassinated Deadly Vipers O-Ren Ishii and Vernita Green. She goes to the trailer of Bill's brother and Deadly Viper Budd, planning to ambush him. Budd has been warned by Bill of her approach; he shoots her in the chest with a shotgun blast of rock salt, then sedates her. He calls Elle Driver, another former Deadly Viper, and arranges to sell her the Bride's unique sword for a million dollars. He seals the Bride inside a coffin and buries her alive.\n\nYears earlier, Bill tells the young Bride of the legendary martial arts master Pai Mei and his Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique, a death blow that Mei refuses to teach his students; the technique that supposedly kills any opponent after they have taken five steps. Bill takes the Bride to Mei's temple for training. Mei ridicules her and makes her training a torment, but she gains his respect. In the present, the Bride uses Mei's martial arts techniques to break out of the coffin and claw her way to the surface.\n\nElle arrives at Budd's trailer and kills him with a black mamba hidden with the money for the sword. She calls Bill and tells him the Bride has killed Budd and that Elle has killed the Bride. She uses the Bride's real name: Beatrix Kiddo. As Elle exits the trailer, Beatrix ambushes her and they fight. Elle, who was also taught by Mei, taunts Beatrix by revealing that she poisoned Mei in retribution for his plucking out her eye. Beatrix plucks out Elle's remaining eye and leaves her screaming in the trailer with the black mamba.\n\nIn Mexico, Beatrix meets a retired pimp, Esteban Vihaio, who helps her find Bill. She tracks him to a hotel, and discovers that their daughter B.B. is still alive, now aged four. She spends the evening with them. After she puts B.B. to bed, Bill shoots Beatrix with a dart containing truth serum and interrogates her. She recounts a mission in which she discovered she was pregnant and explains that she left the Deadly Vipers to give B.B. a better life. Bill explains that he assumed she had died and mourned her for three months; he ordered her assassination when he discovered she was alive and engaged to a \"jerk\" he assumed was the father of her child. Beatrix disables Bill and strikes with Mei's Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique, which she kept secret. Bill makes his peace with her, takes five steps and dies. Beatrix leaves with B.B. to start a new life.\n\n\nAs with Tarantino's previous films, \"Kill Bill\" features an eclectic soundtrack comprising many musical genres. On the two soundtracks, music ranges from country music to selections from the Spaghetti Western film scores of Ennio Morricone. Bernard Herrmann's theme from the film \"Twisted Nerve\" is whistled by the menacing Elle Driver in the hospital scene. A brief, 15-second excerpt from the opening of the \"Ironside\" theme music by Quincy Jones is used as the Bride's revenge motif, which flares up with a red-tinged flashback whenever she's in the company of her next target. Instrumental tracks from Japanese guitarist Tomoyasu Hotei figure prominently, and after the success of \"Kill Bill\" they were frequently used in American TV commercials and at sporting events. The end credits are driven by the rock and roll version of \"Malagueña Salerosa\", a traditional Mexican song, performed by \"Chingon\", Robert Rodriguez's band.\n\n\"Kill Bill: Volume 2\" was released in theaters on , 2004. It was originally scheduled to be released on , 2004, but was rescheduled. \"Variety\" posited that the delay was to coincide its theatrical release with \"Volume 1\"s release on DVD. In the United States and Canada, \"Volume 2\" was released in and grossed on its opening weekend, ranking first at the box office and beating fellow opener \"The Punisher\". \"Volume 2\"s opening weekend gross was higher than \"Volume 1\"s, and the equivalent success confirmed the studio's financial decision to split the film into two theatrical releases. \"Volume 2\" attracted more female theatergoers than \"Volume 1\", with 60% of the audience being male and 56% of the audience being men between the ages of 18 to 29 years old. \"Volume 2\"s opening weekend was the largest to date for Miramax Films aside from releases under its arm Dimension Films. The opening weekend was also the largest to date in the month of April for a film restricted in the United States to theatergoers 17 years old and up, besting \"Life\"s 1999 record. \"Volume 2\"s opening weekend was strengthened by the reception of \"Volume 1\" in the previous year among audiences and critics, abundant publicity related to the splitting into two volumes, and the DVD release of \"Volume 1\" in the week before \"Volume 2\"s theatrical release.\n\nOutside of the United States and Canada, \"Volume 2\" was released in 20 territories over the weekend of , 2004. It grossed an estimated and ranked first at the international box office, ending an eight-week streak held by \"The Passion of the Christ\". \"Volume 2\" grossed a total of in the United States and Canada and in other territories for a worldwide total of .\n\nIn the United States, \"Volume 2\" was released on DVD and VHS on August 10, 2004.\n\nIn a December 2005 interview, Tarantino addressed the lack of a special edition DVD for \"Kill Bill\" by stating \"I've been holding off because I've been working on it for so long that I just wanted a year off from \"Kill Bill\" and then I'll do the big supplementary DVD package.\"\n\nThe United States does not have a DVD boxed set of \"Kill Bill\", though box sets of the two separate volumes are available in other countries, such as France, Japan and the United Kingdom. Upon the DVD release of \"Volume 2\" in the US, however, Best Buy did offer an exclusive box set slipcase to house the two individual releases together.\n\nBoth \"Volume 1\" and \"Volume 2\", were released in High Definition on Blu-ray on September 9, 2008 in the United States.\n\nAt the 2008 Provincetown International Film Festival, Tarantino announced that the original cut of \"Kill Bill\", incorporating both films and an extended animation sequence, would be released in May 2009 as \"Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair\". Screenings began on March 27, 2011 at the New Beverly Cinema.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, \"Kill Bill: Volume 2\" received a score of 84% based on reviews from 238 critics, and an average rating of 7.8/10. The website's critical consensus states, \"\"Kill Bill: Volume 2\" adds extra plot and dialogue to the action-heavy exploits of its predecessor, while still managing to deliver a suitably hard-hitting sequel.\" At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 83 out of 100 based on 41 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n\nRoger Ebert celebrated the films, saying \"Put the two parts together, and Tarantino has made a masterful saga that celebrates the martial arts genre while kidding it, loving it, and transcending it. ... This is all one film, and now that we see it whole, it's greater than its two parts.\" In 2009, he placed the film on his twenty best films of the decade list.\n\nUma Thurman received a Golden Globe Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama nomination in 2005 for her role. David Carradine also received a Best Supporting Actor nomination in the same year. \"Kill Bill: Volume 2\" was placed in \"Empire\" Magazine's list of the \"500 Greatest Films of All Time\" at number 423 and the Bride was also ranked number 66 in \"Empire\" magazine's \"100 Greatest Movie Characters\".\n\nIn April 2004, Tarantino told \"Entertainment Weekly\" that he was planning a sequel:\n\nAt the 2006 San Diego Comic-Con International, Tarantino stated that, after the completion of \"Grindhouse\", he wanted to make two anime \"Kill Bill\" films: an origin story about Bill and his mentors, and another origin starring the Bride.\n\nDetails emerged around 2007 about two possible sequels, \"Kill Bill: Volumes 3 and 4\". According to the article, \"the third film involves the revenge of two killers whose arms and eye were hacked by Uma Thurman in the first stories.\" The article adds that the \"fourth installment of the popular kung fu action films concerns a cycle of reprisals and daughters who avenge their mother's deaths\".\n\nAt the 2009 Morelia International Film Festival, Tarantino stated that he intended to make a third \"Kill Bill\" film. The same month, he stated that \"Kill Bill 3\" would be his ninth film, and would be released in 2014. He stated that he wanted ten years to pass after the Bride's last conflict, to give her and her daughter a period of peace.\n\nIn December 2012, Tarantino stated: \"I don't know if there's ever going to be a \"Kill Bill Vol. 3\". We'll see, probably not though.\" In January 2016, it was reported that Tarantino has spoken with Thurman on a potential return for a sequel, but noted that Tarantino remains non-committal on actually making a sequel.\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1985 by director and activist John Malpede, LAPD members are mostly homeless or formerly homeless people who collaborate with advocates, social service professionals and community members to create performances and multimedia art that highlight connections between their lived experiences and external forces that impact their lives.\n\nPerformance artist John Malpede moved to Los Angeles from New York in 1984 to start work as an outreach paralegal at the Inner City Law Center (ICLC). He began leading theater workshops for the neighborhood's homeless population out of the ICLC's offices on Skid Row, gathering a group of performers and artists who now create their art as the Los Angeles Poverty Department (the acronym, LAPD, is a deliberate appropriation of that of the Los Angeles Police Department). At the time it was founded, the LAPD was the first theater by and for homeless people in the country and the first arts-based initiative for the Los Angeles homeless population. Since its inception, the LAPD has been dedicated to giving expression to the homeless community's struggle to create meaning out of their own lives and to avoid a sentimentalized or stereotyped narrative of victimization. Material is often developed and rehearsed through community workshops and feedback sessions, continually evolving through conversation with the community.\nThe ultimate enactment of ensemble members' lives in front of an audience seeks to transform the audience into witnesses rather than spectators.\n\nIn addition to ongoing workshops and the creation of new work, the LAPD's activities include touring of their repertory and commissions.

{"id": "11209942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11209942", "title": "Lycurgus Cup", "text": "Lycurgus Cup\n\nThe Lycurgus Cup is a 4th-century Roman glass cage cup made of a dichroic glass, which shows a different colour depending on whether or not light is passing through it; red when lit from behind and green when lit from in front. It is the only complete Roman glass object made from this type of glass, and the one exhibiting the most impressive change in colour; it has been described as \"the most spectacular glass of the period, fittingly decorated, which we know to have existed\".\n\nThe cup is also a very rare example of a complete Roman cage-cup, or \"diatretum\", where the glass has been painstakingly cut and ground back to leave only a decorative \"cage\" at the original surface-level. Many parts of the cage have been completely undercut. Most cage-cups have a cage with a geometric abstract design, but here there is a composition with figures, showing the mythical King Lycurgus, who (depending on the version) tried to kill Ambrosia, a follower of the god Dionysus (Bacchus to the Romans). She was transformed into a vine that twined around the enraged king and restrained him, eventually killing him. Dionysus and two followers are shown taunting the king. The cup is the \"only well-preserved figural example\" of a cage cup.\n\nThe dichroic effect is achieved by making the glass with tiny proportions of nanoparticles of gold and silver dispersed in colloidal form throughout the glass material. The process used remains unclear, and it is likely that it was not well understood or controlled by the makers, and was probably discovered by accidental \"contamination\" with minutely ground gold and silver dust. The glass-makers may not even have known that gold was involved, as the quantities involved are so tiny; they may have come from a small proportion of gold in any silver added (most Roman silver contains small proportions of gold), or from traces of gold or gold leaf left by accident in the workshop, as residue on tools, or from other work. The very few other surviving fragments of Roman dichroic glass vary considerably in their two colours.\n\nCorning Glass Works has reproduced a blank of a material of similar chemical composition and internal structure, which displays under reflected and transmitted light the same \"Lycurgus effect\" of green to red colour change as the Lycurgus cup material does. Cranberry glass or gold ruby glass is somewhat similar and far more common, manufactured with colloidal gold, but this only ever shows a red colour.\n\nTo a conventionally composed Roman glass flux 330 parts per million of silver and 40 of gold were added: \"These particles were precipitated as colloids and form a silver-gold alloy. When viewed in reflected light the minute metallic particles are just coarse enough to reflect enough of the light without eliminating the transmission. In transmitted light the fine particles scatter the blue end of the spectrum more effectively than the red end, resulting in red transmission, and this is the colour observed. Since it is impossible that the Roman artisans managed to add these incredibly low levels of silver and gold to the volume of the glass used to make the vessel deliberately, the levels were probably added at higher levels to a larger volume of glass-melt, and increasingly diluted by adding more glass.\" The particles are only about 70 nanometers across, and embedded in the glass, so they cannot be seen by optical microscopy, and a transmission electron microscope is needed instead. At this size they approach the size of the wavelengths of visible light, and a surface plasmon resonance effect takes place.\n\nThe interior of the cup is mostly smooth, but behind the main figures the glass has been hollowed out, well beyond even the main outer surface, so that they are of similar thickness to the main outer surface, giving an even colour when light passes through. This is a feature unique among surviving cups; Harden suggests they were an \"afterthought\". An area around the torso of Lycurgus is a rather different colour from the rest of the glass; perhaps an accident of manufacture, but one exploited by the glass-cutter \"so that he could make Lycurgus's rage glow even more strongly\". After the very lengthy cutting stage the fine polished appearance was achieved by a process called \"flame polishing\" that risked the complete loss of the object. A suggestion in 1995 that in fact this and other cage cups used a mixture of moulding and cutting has met with little acceptance.\nLike the British Museum's other spectacular work in Roman glass, the cameo glass Portland Vase, the cup represents to some extent the extension of skills developed by cutters of engraved gems, or the larger hardstone carving of vessels in semi-precious stones, which were luxury arts with enormous prestige in ancient Rome. No carved gemstone vessels directly comparable to either work are known, but the general taste behind these extreme exhibitions of glass-making skill is one formed by objects in natural stones like the Coupe des Ptolémées or the Rubens Vase. Indeed, it was not until the first full studies of the cup in 1950 that it was established for certain that the material was glass and not a gemstone, which had previously been in question.\n\nIt seems likely that as many as three separate workshops or factories will have been involved in the whole process, perhaps not in the same part of the Empire. The glass may have been initially made in a large block of standard clear glass, perhaps in Egypt or Palestine, which both exported great quantities of glass for forming, and sometimes colouring, elsewhere. The thick \"blank\" dichroic vessel was probably made by one specialist workshop and passed to another consisting of specialist cutters. This would certainly have been a rare and highly expensive object, and the secrets of its manufacture, possibly not well understood even by its makers, seem only to have been used for about a century.\n\nThere are various small losses, of which the face of the panther is the most significant, and the cup is cracked; the British Museum has never removed the metal rim for this reason. The base or foot of the cup is damaged, and the original form of the base uncertain. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York has a fragment measuring 2 3/16 x 3 in. (56 x 76 mm) of a satyr from a dichroic cage cup that turns from olive green to \"reddish amber\".\n\nThe figure of Lycurgus, bound by the vine and naked apart from boots, is flanked on the left by a crouching Ambrosia, at a considerably smaller scale. Behind her one of Dionysus's satyrs (shown with a normal human form) stands on one foot as he prepares to hurl a large rock at Lycurgus. In his other hand he holds a \"pedum\" or shepherd's crook. To the right of Lycurgus comes first a figure of Pan, then at his feet a rather canine-looking panther, the traditional companion of Dionysus, whose face is missing but was presumably snapping at the king, and then the god himself, taunting him with his right arm extended in an angry gesture. Dionysus carries a thyrsus, the special staff of the god and his followers, and his dress has an Eastern, perhaps Indian, flavour, reflecting what the Ancient Greeks generally believed (perhaps wrongly) about the origins of his cult. The calf section of one leg has been lost. A streamer hanging behind him from his thyrsus overlaps the raised foot of the satyr with the rock, completing the circle of the cup.\n\nIt has been suggested that this not very common scene was a reference to the defeat in 324 by the Emperor Constantine I of his co-emperor Licinius, who was killed in 325 after a period under close guard. Another suggestion is that the colour change from green to red was understood as evoking the ripening of red grapes, so that there was a particular suitability in depicting a scene with the god of wine. The cup may have been intended for use at Bacchic cult celebrations, still very much a feature of Roman religious life around 300. A letter supposedly from the Emperor Hadrian (d. 138) to his brother-in-law Servianus, quoted in a biography in the \"Historia Augusta\", records the gift of two dichroic cups, which the 4th century author had seen: \"I have sent you particoloured cups that change colour, presented to me by the priest of a temple. They are specially dedicated to you and my sister. I would like you to use them at banquets on feast days.\"\n\nOther depictions of the story tend to either depict Lycurgus attacking Ambrosia, often with a double-headed axe, while her companions rush to her aid, or Lycurgus alone, entangled in the vine. The closest parallel to the scene on the cup is one of the apse mosaics in the triconch \"triclinium\" at the Villa del Casale, Piazza Armerina, which may also refer to Licinius. There is also a mosaic at Antioch on the Orontes, and a group on a 2nd-century sarcophagus at the Villa Parisi in Frascati. There is also a floor-mosaic from Vienne, now in the museum at Saint-Romain-en-Gal, with Lycurgus alone inside the vine. The preceding scene of Lycurgus attacking Ambrosia, is on a floor-mosaic at Brading Roman Villa on the Isle of Wight. Of this and similar mosaics, Martin Henig says: \"In cases such as this, we are not concerned with simple, popular paganism but with recondite knowledge. This is the sort of esoteric religion which the Emperor Julian, Symmachus, Praetextatus, Macrobius and Proclus relished. The religious thought behind these floors is probably deeper and more complex than contemporary Christianity and many of the keys to understanding it have been lost.\"\n\nThe cup was probably designed for drinking from at feasts, or more specifically Bacchic cult celebrations, where the lack of a foot, also a feature found in other cage-cups, may mean it was passed around, as elaborate cups often were in medieval cultures. Alternatively other cage cups were almost certainly used, suspended, as oil lamps, where the dichroic effect of this cup would show to advantage.\n\nThe cup was \"perhaps made in Alexandria\" or Rome in about 290-325 AD, and measures . From its excellent condition it is probable that, like several other luxury Roman objects, it has always been preserved above ground; most often such objects ended up in the relatively secure environment of a church treasury. Alternatively it might, like several other cage cups, have been recovered from a sarcophagus. The present gilt-bronze rim and foot were added in about 1800, suggesting it was one of the many objects taken from church treasuries during the period of the French Revolution and French Revolutionary Wars. The foot continues the theme of the cup with open-work vine leaves, and the rim has leaf forms that lengthen and shorten to match the scenes in glass. In 1958 the foot was removed by British Museum conservators, and not rejoined to the cup until 1973. There may well have been earlier mounts.\n\nThe early history of the cup is unknown, and it is first mentioned in print in 1845, when a French writer said he had seen it \"some years ago, in the hands of M. Dubois\". This is probably shortly before it was acquired by the Rothschild family. Certainly Lionel de Rothschild owned it by 1857, when the touring Gustav Friedrich Waagen saw it in his collection and described it as \"barbaric and debased\". In 1862 Lionel lent it to an exhibition at what is now the V&A Museum, after which it virtually fell from scholarly view until 1950. In 1958 Victor, Lord Rothschild sold it to the British Museum for £20,000, £2,000 of which was donated by the Art Fund (then the NACF).\n\nThe cup forms part of the museum's Department of Prehistory and Europe rather than the Greece and Rome Department, and was previously on display, lit from behind, in Room 50. In 2015 it was on display with the new display of the Rothschild donation of the Waddesdon Bequest in Room 2A, with a changing internal lighting source that shows the colour change very effectively, though only one side of the cup can be seen. By October 2015 it was back in the re-opened Room 41.\n\nWhile Room 41, where it was then displayed, was closed for refurbishment, from November 2012 to August 2013 it was on display with other British Museum pieces at The Art Institute of Chicago's Jaharis Galleries of Greek, Roman and Byzantine Art, where it was very effectively displayed in a free-standing case, lit from above with changing light so that the colour change was clearly visible. It is considered able to travel to important exhibitions and in 2008 was exhibited in \"Reflecting Antiquity, Modern Glass Inspired by Ancient Rome\" at the Corning Museum of Glass in Corning, New York, in 2003 at the Hayward Gallery in London in \"'Saved! 100 Years of the National Art Collections Fund\", and in 1987 in \"Glass of the Caesars\" in the British Museum, Cologne, Milan, and Rome.\n\n"}

The film is based on the historical novel of the same name by Theodosia Harris, and features an ensemble cast including Sam De Grasse, Douglas Fairbanks, Walter Long and Alfred Paget. Fairbanks role was uncredited, and was his first role in film, although his first starring role, in \"The Lamb\", was released prior to this picture. The film features the Siege of Béxar, Battle of the Alamo and Battle of San Jacinto.\n\nWhile making claims to historical accuracy, the film depicts the Mexican population in San Antonio in 1836 as a group of ill-mannered drunks. One scene depicts a Mexican officer verbally assaulting a white woman and making advances on her. The white woman reports the incident to her husband, Almeron Dickinson who in turn shoots the Mexican officer. In his book \"Remembering the Alamo\", author Richard R. Flores, argues that the negative portrayal of the Mexican population is due to racism toward Mexicans in 1915, the year the film was produced.

His father, Antonio Maria Tovar (1791-1860), was a former official of the Spanish government who had retired after receiving a serious bullet wound during the War of Independence. His mother, Damiana Tovar Liendo (c.1805-1844), was from Caracas. The family had been living in exile in Puerto Rico, but returned to Venezuela immediately before Tovar's birth.\nHe received his first lessons from Celestino Martinez (1820-1855) who, at the age of nineteen, had just become an instructor at the \"Academia de Dibujo\" (Drawing Academy). Later, Tovar studied at the Academy itself with Antonio José Carranza (1817-1893) and at the \"Colegio de La Paz\" with Carmelo Fernández. In 1844, he joined with Fernández and two other artists to acquire a lithography workshop owned by German emigrants.\n\nIn 1850, he travelled to Spain and enrolled at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid. There, he studied with José de Madrazo and his son, Federico de Madrazo, among others. In 1851, he opened a shop called \"Fotografía Artística de Martín Tovar y Tovar\", becoming one of his country's pioneer photographers. In 1852, he moved to Paris and found a position in the workshop of Léon Cogniet. Three years later, he returned to Venezuela, but stayed for only a year before going back to Paris to copy paintings by the major artists, with a view towards using them to establish a national museum in Caracas. His proposal was accepted, but a lack of funds kept it from being realized.\n\nHe continued to focus on portraits, however, and participated in several exhibitions, including the International Exposition (1867) in Paris. Two years later, he was appointed Director of the \"Academia de Bellas Artes\" in Caracas. In 1872, he exhibited at the \"Primera Exposición Anual de Bellas Artes Venezolanas\", organized by the explorers James Mudie Spence (1836-1878) and Anton Goering (who was also a painter).\n\nIn 1873, he received what would be his largest commission; painting 30 portraits of heroes from the War of Independence and other public figures for the \"Salón Elíptico\" at the Palacio Federal Legislativo, a project that would occupy him for two years. In 1881, he received another commission from President Antonio Guzmán Blanco; a large canvas depicting the signing of the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence, also for the \"Salón Elíptico\". The work was presented at the \"Exposición Nacional de Venezuela\" in 1883 and was awarded a gold medal. This resulted in further commissions to portray the battles of Carabobo, Boyacá, Junín and Ayacucho. After researching and sketching the battle sites, he set up a workshop in Paris, which he maintained from 1887 to the late 1890s, commuting between there and Caracas and doing more portraits as well as the battle scenes. He had finished only three of the battles when he died in 1902. The \"Battle of Ayucucho\" was completed by Antonio Herrera Toro, using Tovar's studies.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "47239990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47239990", "title": "Misappropriation doctrine", "text": "Misappropriation doctrine\n\nThe misappropriation doctrine is a U.S. legal theory conferring a \"quasi-property right\" on a person who invests \"labor, skill, and money\" to create an intangible asset. The right operates against another person (usually a competitor of the first person) \"endeavoring to reap where it has not sown\" by \"misappropriating\" the value of the asset (ordinarily by copying what the first person has created). The quoted language and the legal principle come from the decision of the United States Supreme Court in \"International News Service v. Associated Press\", 248 U.S. 215 (1918), also known as \"INS v. AP\" or simply the \"INS\" case.\n\nThe misappropriation doctrine originated as federal common law but since 1938 it has been based on state law. The current viability of the misappropriation doctrine is uncertain because of subsequent developments in U.S. patent and copyright law that \"preempt\" state law that operates in the same field of law, as is explained in the article on \"INS v. AP\".\n\nIn 1918 when the Supreme Court decided the \"INS\" case, a body of federal common law concerning business practices and torts existed that the Supreme Court had power to declare or create. This legal regime stemmed from the 1842 decision of the Supreme Court in \"Swift v. Tyson\". That case held that the federal courts, when deciding legal issues not specifically addressed by the applicable state legislature, had the authority to develop a federal common law. In 1938, however, in \"Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins\", the Supreme Court overruled \"Swift v. Tyson\". Consequently, since that time the misappropriation doctrine fell under the control of the laws of the various states, which were therefore free to accept or reject it.\n\nBefore the \"INS\" case, unfair competition law was generally considered to be limited to cases of \"palming off\"—where the defendant deceived customers by causing them erroneously to believe that the defendant's product emanated from the plaintiff, and as a result diverted trade from the plaintiff to the defendant. The \"INS\" case extended the concept of unfair competition to a much wider range of business conduct, based on the particular court's concept of morality.\n\nThe \"INS\" case, the cornerstone of the misappropriation doctrine, arose out of a dispute between two news gathering organizations, the Associated Press (AP) and the International News Service (INS) over reporting World War I news. The Allied Powers (England and France) perceived William Randolph Hearst's INS to be unduly favorable to the Central Powers (Germany and Austria); therefore, the Allies barred INS from using Allied telegraph lines to report news; this effectively prevented INS from reporting war news. To deal with this, INS copied AP's news bulletins from publicly accessible sources, rewrite them, and distributed the rewrites to INS's client newspapers. The AP then brought an action seeking to enjoin INS from copying AP-gathered news.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in favor of the AP, with Justice Pitney writing for the majority. Justices Holmes and Brandeis wrote dissents.\n\nThe majority opinion by Justice Pitney recognized that the information found in the AP news was not copyrightable. Instead, Pitney approached the issue from the perspective of unfair competition. He found that there was a \"quasi-property right\" in the fresh news as it is \"stock in trade to be gathered at the cost of enterprise, organization, skill, labor and money, and to be distributed and sold to those who will pay money for it.\" Given the \"economic value\" of the news, a company can \"therefore\" have a limited property interest in it against a competitor (but not against the general public) who would attempt to take unfair advantage of the information.\n\nThe Court characterized INS's behavior as \"misappropriation.\" Due to the tenuous value of \"hot\" news, Pitney narrowed the period for which the proprietary right would apply: copying was forbidden \"only to the extent necessary to prevent that competitor from reaping the fruits of complainant's efforts and expenditure.\"\n\nThe Court justified its creation of a \"quasi-property right\" in these terms:\n\nJustice Holmes dissented, arguing that the law of unfair competition requires a misrepresentation. If the misrepresentation here is that some people may think AP copied the news from INS, the proper remedy would be only to prohibit INS (for a limited time) from copying from AP unless it provides a notice that it copied from AP.\n\nJustice Brandeis dissented on the grounds that \"reaping where another sowed\" is not an actionable tort: \"[O]rdinarily one is at perfect liberty to find out, if he can by lawful means, trade secrets of another, however valuable, and then use the knowledge so acquired gainfully, although it cost the original owner much in effort and in money to collect or produce.\"\n\nBrandeis closed his dissent with an argument that the Court was ill-suited to act as a legislature and the matter should be left to the wisdom of Congress:\n\nThe creation or recognition by courts of a new private right may work serious injury to the general public, unless the boundaries of the right are definitely established and wisely guarded. . . . A Legislature, urged to enact a law by which one news agency or newspaper may prevent appropriation of the fruits of its labors by another, would consider . . . [possible adverse effects on the public and other businesses]. Legislators might conclude that it was impossible to put an end to the obvious injustice involved in such appropriation of news, without opening the door to other evils, greater than that sought to be remedied.\n\nAlthough \"INS\" was a landmark case when it was decided, subsequent developments have diminished its significance and that of the misappropriation doctrine. A leading copyright law scholar has commented:\n\nIt has been suggested that the credence due the \"International News Service\" case today is minimal: that subsequent decisions have restricted its [misappropriation] doctrine to the news context and that, in any event, it is but a derelict of the federal common law, untenable after \"Erie R.R. v. Tompkins\".\n\nSeventh Circuit Judge Posner similarly remarked that \"INS\" is \"a decision no longer authoritative because it was based on the federal courts' subsequently abandoned authority to formulate common law principles . . . .\n\nThe misappropriation doctrine still persists, however, in the area of \"hot news\" and other time-value information and in those states that give the \"INS\" doctrine expansive scope against \"immoral\" commercial behavior, typically involving copying.\n\nAn additional factor affecting the scope and viability of the misappropriation doctrine has been the development of the federal preemption doctrine since the 1960s. This doctrine makes state law ineffective when it conflicts with or disturbs the balance between competition and monopoly struck in the federal intellectual property laws.\nOn the other hand, the misappropriation doctrine has not been preempted in areas where a type of copying is not regulated under federal copyright or patent law. But the limits of this dispensation are uncertain: the boundary condition may be that state law may operate so long as the omission from federal regulation is not the result of a congressional decision that the area should be left open to free competition; an alternative boundary rule may be that the state law must not upset a delicate balance which the court perceives that the federal system has struck.\n\nIn \"Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co.\", in 1938, the Supreme Court considered a case arguably akin to \"INS\" but (with Justice Brandeis now writing for the Court's majority instead of dissenting as in \"INS\") denied relief. The \"Kellogg\" Court said:\n\nKellogg Company is undoubtedly sharing in the goodwill of the article known as \"Shredded Wheat\"; and thus is sharing in a market which was created by the skill and judgment of plaintiff's predecessor and has been widely extended by vast expenditures in advertising persistently made. But that is not unfair. Sharing in the goodwill of an article unprotected by patent or trade-mark is the exercise of a right possessed by all—and in the free exercise of which the consuming public is deeply interested.\n\nOne commentator maintained that one could properly—\n\n...view \"Kellogg\" as vindication of the views that he [Brandeis] expressed in \"INS\". That Nabisco had invested in the shredded wheat product did not give it control over the use of the pillow shape (or the term SHREDDED WHEAT); it had no property right against misappropriation of the shape after the expiry of the patents. Instead, Brandeis inquired [only] whether Kellogg had engaged in any acts of misrepresentation.\n\nSince Kellogg did not misrepresent its version of Shredded Wheat, the Court held it free to appropriate the unpatented, uncopyrighted biscuit features regardless of Nabisco's expenditure of labor, skill, and money, and it allowed Kellogg to reap where Nabisco had sown.\n\nIn \"Sears v. Stiffel\" and \"Compco v. Day-Brite\", the defendants copied the unpatented, uncopyrighted product designs of the plaintiffs. The lower courts had applied what amounted to the \"INS\" misappropriation doctrine to hold the defendants guilty of unfair competition. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that state law was being used to create a state-law equivalent of the federal patent system, and that disturbed the balance Congress had struck in this area. One commentator explained: \"Though \"International News Service\" has never been expressly overruled, the Court was, in \"Sears\" and \"Compco\", apparently rejecting its approach.\nIn 1989, the Court struck down a state law protecting boat designs that were neither patented nor copyrighted, in \"Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc.\", thus reaffirming the preemption rule of the \"Sears\" and \"Compco\" cases barring \"INS\"-like protection of product designs where the patent or copyright laws might otherwise apply.\n\nOn the other hand, the Court has permitted state misappropriation law to apply against copying in areas not regulated by federal law, such as sound recordings before 1978. A comparison of these decisions with the 1989 \"Bonito Boats\" decision may suggest a less preemptive approach to subject matter in the neighborhood of copyright than in the neighborhood of patent law.\n\nIn a number of cases, courts have applied the misappropriation doctrine to copying in fact settings analogous to the circumstances of the \"INS\" case—a competitor's appropriation of information that is costly to generate and that has value for only a limited time.\n\nThe original core holding and narrowest implication of \"INS\" was that there was now a \"hot news\" doctrine that protected first comers in their creation of an ephemeral, time-sensitive information asset at appreciable expense against \"free riders.\" The Second Circuit addressed this concept in \"National Basketball Association v. Motorola, Inc. (NBA)\". But the Second Circuit imposed precise limits on the rule to avoid possible conflict with copyright law and the First Amendment. It held that under New York State law, a \"hot-news,\" \"INS\"-like claim exists only in cases where:\n\nThe Second Circuit held that the \"hot news\" tort was largely preempted by the 1976 Copyright Act, in this case, and it tailored the five factors to avoid such preemption. The effect was to limit the scope of the hot-news branch of the misappropriation doctrine largely to the facts of the \"INS\" case.\n\nThe language of the \"INS\" case can be interpreted to cover conduct quite different in kind from the appropriation of hot news. Some states, such as New Jersey and Wisconsin, and at times New York, have applied the doctrine more broadly to cover any conduct that the courts deemed \"immoral\" under open-ended, flexible, adaptable, capacious, and amorphous standards.\n\nFor example, the Second Circuit at one point spoke sweepingly of the scope of the New York misappropriation doctrine in these terms:\n\nNew York courts have noted the incalculable variety of illegal practices falling within the unfair competition rubric, calling it a broad and flexible doctrine that depends more upon the facts set forth than in most causes of action. It has been broadly described as encompassing any form of commercial immorality, or simply as endeavoring to reap where one has not sown; it is taking the skill, expenditures and labors of a competitor, and misappropriating for the commercial advantage of one person a benefit or property right belonging to another. The tort is adaptable and capacious.\n\nIn addition, the determinative factor is \"whether the acts of a defendant are 'fair or unfair, according to principles recognized in equity, and not by 'the morals of the market place.'\"\n\nSimilarly, New Jersey courts have said that state's unfair competition law is a matter of determining what is \"fair play.\" More generally, the Third Circuit said of New Jersey unfair competition law:\nNew Jersey's common law of unfair competition does not have clear boundaries but is instead flexible and elastic as evolving standards of morality demand, and the essence of an unfair competition claim is the enforcement of fair play.\nNew Jersey courts have therefore placed great focus on what they perceived to be the moral and ethical quality of the defendant's conduct. They recognize that their \"law of unfair competition is an amorphous area of jurisprudence. It knows no clear boundaries.\"\n\nIn \"Mercury Records Productions, Inc. v. Economic Consultants, Inc.\", the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that \"INS\" states the applicable law for Wisconsin: \"The unfair competition-misappropriation theory applied in \"INS\" . . . comports with the theory\" of the Wisconsin courts and \"is consistent with the public policy of the state of Wisconsin\"; that state policy is \"simply simply the principles of old-fashioned honesty,\" meaning that \"[o]ne man may not reap where another has sown nor gather where another has strewn.\"\n\nCalifornia, Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Nouth Carolina, and Wisconsin applied the \"INS\" misappropriation doctrine to enjoin those copying records (so-called record piracy) during the period when federal copyright law did not cover sound recordings.\n\nBut those courts have applied the misappropriation doctrine, as well, to other forms of copying, such as copying of products. Many of these cases were decided before the Supreme Court's \"Sears\", \"Compco\", and \"Bonito Boats\" decisions, which have raised preemption issues as to some of these misappropriation decisions.\n\nFor example, in a 1940 case under New York law, the defendant copied the ornamental design of the plaintiff's silverplate as well as \"a similar system of advertising, copied at least in part by the defendant; and high pressure salesmanship in obtaining a wide market amongst dealers by offering attractively a greater number of pieces in a set of inferior quality at a much lower price,\" while pointing out to the dealers that they could sell the defendant's silverware to customers instead of the plaintiff's because \"purchasers would readily believe that the old pattern or a new one of similar type was being offered at a bargain.\" In this manner, the defendant succeeded in \"attracting the interest of a class having some knowledge of patterns but being largely uninformed and undiscriminating concerning the quality of the wares and the reputation and business standing of different manufacturers, who are attracted by offers of a bargain.\" The court held that this was unfair competition, under the standard that \"whether the acts of a defendant are 'fair or unfair, [must be judged] according to principles recognized in equity, and not by 'the morals of the market place.'\" \nIn another New York case, the defendant copied the plaintiff's unpatented, uncopyrighted \"Mustard Seed Remembrancer\" locket, containing a mustard seed to remind users of the power of \"so much faith as a grain of mustard\" to move mountains (\"Matt\". 17:20). The court found misappropriation under the \"INS\" doctrine. It also cited and relied upon the concept of unfair competition described in the preceding silverplate case. The court specifically declined to follow the \"Kellogg\" decision, discussed earlier.\n\nIn 1985, in a subsequent case under New York law, involving the copying of ornamental jewelry designs, the defendant asserted preemption as a defense. The district court opined in \"dicta\"—\"Were Gemveto's claim predicated solely upon Cooper's having copied plaintiff's jewelry designs [\"i.e.\", New York misappropriation law] the claim perhaps would be preempted by federal law.\" But \"there was proof not only that Cooper copied Gemveto's products but of a deliberate attempt by Cooper to deceive the consuming public as to the source of its \"knockoffs\" and thereby to appropriate the goodwill or reputation of Gemveto, a rival seller.\" Therefore, it was proper to enjoin the defendant under New York's law against palming off, the district court ruled, without reaching the issue of whether federal copyright or patent law preempted New York's misappropriation law against product imitation. On appeal, the Second Circuit vacated the district court's injunction against copying, because it was insufficiently clear as to what palming-off activity the defendant was prohibited from engaging in. The final order by the district court permanently enjoined Cooper \"from selling or offering for sale any item of jewelry that is confusingly similar in appearance to any item of plaintiff's jewelry such that the sale or offer for sale of such item, \"by any method or means, is calculated to deceive the public as to its source\"...\" But \"the \"Sears\" and \"Compco\" decisions . . . hold that copying of the article itself that is unprotected by the federal patent and copyright laws cannot be protected by state law,\" the Second Circuit stated. To avoid colliding with \"Sears-Compco\", the district court had to enter an order with \"an appropriate re-wording of the injunction to specify Cooper's acts which would, if not enjoined, constitute palming-off under New York common law.\" The court ruled that the injunction must be directed against deceptive conduct (palming off), not the nature of the product; under \"Compco\", for example, the defendant had a right to make a confusingly similar jewelry item, so long as it did not engage in deceptive palming off.\n\nA much more recent jewelry-copying case under New York law appears to state the current view of New York's misappropriation law, as applied to both patent and copyright preemption (outside the \"hot news\" field):\n\nIn order to avoid preemption, that which is claimed to be unfair competition must be something different from copying, or the fruits of copying, or the intent or bad faith that can be inferred from the act of copying; if the harm [to plaintiff] arises from the simple fact of copying, the claim falls within the Copyright Act [or patent law] and is preempted.\n\nWhen the claim is in substance based on mere copying, it will be dismissed. More generally, the Second Circuit has said of preemption and the misappropriation doctrine:\n\n[W]e believe that \"Metropolitan Opera\" 's broad misappropriation doctrine based on amorphous concepts such as \"commercial immorality\" or society's \"ethics\" is preempted. Such concepts are virtually synonymous for wrongful copying and are in no meaningful fashion distinguishable from infringement of a copyright.\n\nOther circuits have treated the misappropriation doctrine and preemption boundary similarly to the Second Circuit's line of cases. They require the state-law claim to be based on something significantly or \"qualitatively\" extra, beyond mere copying of the plaintiff's product or service to avoid preemption. Many of these cases hold that \"commercial immorality\" plus copying is no more than copying alone for preemption purposes.\n"}

It was critically maligned on its theatrical release, but is now generally highly regarded among fans of underground and independent film.\n\nIt was acquired by Alamo Drafthouse Films in October 2013 and remastered in HD from the original negatives. The distributor released the film on Blu-ray, DVD, and digital copy in March 2014.\n\nWhile walking home from work, Thana, a mute seamstress in New York City's Garment District, is raped at gunpoint in an alley by a mysterious, masked attacker. She survives and makes her way back to her apartment, where she encounters a burglar and is raped a second time. Thana, her name an allusion to Greek god of death Thanatos, hits this second assailant with a small sculpture then bludgeons him to death with an iron, and carries his body to the bathtub. She goes to work the next day, and after encountering working with an iron, watching her boss Albert rip a shirt off a mannequin, she goes into shock state, which worries her co-workers. However, when she looks at the trash bin at her office, she decides to dismember the burglar's corpse and throw the parts away in various locations of the city.\n\nAfter being sent home, she dismembers the burglar's body, then keeps his .45 caliber pistol, puts the pieces into plastic garbage bags, and then stores them in her fridge. After cleaning her bathtub, she decides to take a shower, but as she strips, she begins to hallucinate the first attacker in the mirror grabbing her breast. This puts her into shock, and notices that organs and body fluids from the burglar are overflowing in the drain. Her nosy neighbor, an old, recently widowed woman named Mrs. Nasone who is the landlady and owns a small dog named Phil, also starts to notice her odd behavior.\n\nOn her walk home from work the next day, Thana is noticed by a leering young man on the street while she is disposing of one of the bagged body parts; thinking that she accidentally dropped the bag, he retrieves it, frightening her. He chases her through the alleys of the city, and fearing another sexual assault, she fatally shoots him when she is cornered by him. The event furthers her impulse for vengeance. While running home from the incident, the landlady Mrs. Nasone notices she ran up the stairs violently and started throwing up. She insists in calling a doctor for Thana, and Mrs. Nasone's dog, Phil, starts to become attracted to her fridge. Thana escorts her out of her apartment while still in shock.\n\nAs the limbs start to bring attention towards the media, Albert brings her into his office and notices she hasn't been selling and feeling well lately. He decides to invite her to a Halloween party that he is throwing for work, and tells her that there will be \"many boys there [her] age\". She responds to him in writing, saying \"I'll try\". As Thana's vengeance increases, she starts regularly targeting and killing several men, such as a fashion photographer, a pimp who assaults a prostitute because of debt, several members of a gang, a Saudi Arabian businessman and his limousine driver, and even drives a recently dumped salesman to suicide after her gun jams.\n\nHer boss, Albert notices her ditching work after going to dinner with her co-workers, resulting in her co-workers having to finish her work. However, she promises to go to the party with him in exchange for staying out of trouble for her absence. Thana notices that Mrs. Nasone's dog, Phil, is attracted to the smell of the burglar's dismembered limbs. Thana takes Phil for a walk then ties him to a post in the park. She leaves a note saying that Phil ran away but will probably find his way back home soon. \n\nWith Albert, Thana attends the costume party dressed as a nun with red lipstick. Meanwhile, Mrs. Nasone enters Thana's apartment and finds the burglar's dismembered head. She jumps to the conclusion that Thana killed her dog, and tells police that she is at a party with her co-workers. At the party, Albert takes Thana upstairs in private and tries to seduce her. In revenge for his borderline-sexual behavior towards her in the past, she shoots him. The party stops and her co-workers run upstairs to Thana, but quickly realize that she is the murderer when she steps out of the room with her pistol. Thana then begins a shooting spree, targeting many of the men present. Her co-worker Laurie picks up the knife from the cake table and stabs Thana in the back. Thana turns around and points the gun at Laurie, but hesitates; she screams in pain, \"Sister!\" then falls to the ground and dies.\n\nAfter the party massacre, Mrs. Nasone is seen crying in memorial for her husband and her dog Phil. But outside her apartment door, Phil has returned and is shown running up the stairs and scratching at the door.\n\n\nMany years later Zoë Tamerlis described how minimal the script was, which is uncharacteristic of Ferrara's later films.\n\nThe film currently holds an 89% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 27 critic reviews, with wide praise.\n\nIn 1983, the film was released on VHS by U.S.A. Home Video in its uncut form.\n\n\"Ms .45\" was released on DVD in the U.S. on April 25, 2000, by Image Entertainment, but was reedited for DVD release. The reedit removes less than a minute total. The cuts include changes to the first rape featuring Ferrara's cameo, which is split by an insert shot from a later scene. The second rape is more drastically cut, omitting a line \"This oughta make you talk, huh?\" The climactic Halloween party shoot-out was also recut to remove an on-screen murder, which now occurs off screen.\n\nThe uncut DVD / Blu-ray / digital copy is now available in the US, published by Drafthouse Films.\n\n"}

The mosaic was part of a Classical sanctuary-grotto in Palestrina, a town east of Ancient Rome, in central Italy. It has a width of 5.85 metres and a height of 4.31 metres and provides a glimpse into the Roman fascination with ancient Egyptian exoticism in the 1st century BC, both as an early manifestation of the role of Egypt in the Roman imagination and an example of the genre of \"Nilotic landscape\", with a long iconographic history in Egypt and the Aegean.\n\nThe mosaic, with an arch-headed framing that identifies its original location as flooring an apse in a grotto, features detailed depictions of Ptolemaic Greeks, Aethiopians in hunting scenes, and various animals of the Nile river. It is the earliest Roman depiction of Nilotic scenes, of which several more were uncovered at Pompeii. A consensus on the dating of the work is slowly emerging. Paul G. P. Meyboom suggests a date shortly before the reign of Sulla (ca. 100 BC) and treats the mosaic as an early evidence for the spread of Egyptian cults in Italy, where Isis was syncretised with Fortuna. He believes Nilotic scenes were introduced in Rome by Demetrius the Topographer, a Greek artist from Ptolemaic Egypt active ca. 165 BC. Claire Préaux emphasises the \"escapist\" nature of the fantastic scenery.\n\nThe Nile Mosaic and its companion piece, the Fish Mosaic, were apparently still to be seen in the Italian city of Palestrina, ancient Praeneste, in the 15th century. When first noticed shortly before 1507 by Antonio Volsco, a humanist in the circle of Pomponio Leto, the mosaics were still \"in situ\" among the vestiges of Sulla's sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia. At that time the town was owned by the Colonna family of Rome, whose palazzo in Palestrina occupied a section of the ruins.\n\nThe mosaic may have been indicated in a well-known passage in Pliny's Natural History concerning mosaic floors in Italy:\nVolsco added that these were \"arranged in the pattern of a picture\". Maurizio Calvesi, in identifying Francesco Colonna as the author of \"Hypnerotomachia Poliphili\", identifies passages in \"Hypnerotomachia\" depending on Pliny that were enriched by direct experience of the mosaics themselves.\n\nIn the 17th century, Palestrina passed to the Barberini family, who between 1624 and 1626 removed most of the mosaic from its setting, without recording the overall composition, and, after further movements and damage, put it on exhibition in the Palazzo Barberini in Palestrina, where it remains. The mosaic was restored and repaired on numerous occasions, but careful watercolors of the sections were made for Cassiano dal Pozzo before the initial restoration in the \"opificio\" of St. Peter's. Helen Whitehouse's rediscovery of the long-lost watercolors enabled a reconstruction of the surviving segments in a more meaningful way although much remains uncertain about the original composition. The mosaic has been a major feature of the \"Museo Nazionale Prenestino\" in Palazzo Barberini, Palestrina (not the one in Rome) since 1953\n\n"}

Some dramas include a lab or conference room with high-tech or state-of-the-art equipment where the main characters meet to work out the problem. Shows usually have an episodic format that does not require the viewer to have seen previous episodes. Episodes typically have a self-contained, also referred to as stand-alone, plot that is introduced and resolved within the same episode.\nThe procedural format is popular around the world. In 2011, the director of a TV consultancy said, \"The continuing trend is for procedurals because they use a predictable structure.\" Due to their stand-alone episodic nature, they are more accessible to new viewers than serials. Self-contained episodes also make it easier for viewers to return to a show if they have missed some episodes. In general, procedural dramas can usually be re-run with little concern for episode order.\n\nProcedurals are often criticized for being . Procedurals are also generally less character-driven than serialized shows. However, some procedurals have more character emphasis than is typical of the format. Some may occasionally feature a storyline stretching over several episodes (often called a story arc).\n\nA popular variant is the police procedural.\n\n\n"}

It has been described as a way to \"rebrand\" or \"restart an entertainment universe that has already been established\". Another definition is a remake which is part of an established film series or other media franchise. The term has been criticised for being a vague and \"confusing\" \"buzzword\", and a neologism for remake, a concept which has been losing popularity in the 2010s.\n\nThe term is thought to originate from the computing term \"reboot\", meaning to restart a computer system.\n\nReboots cut out non-essential elements associated with a pre-established franchise and start it anew, distilling it down to the core elements that made the source material popular. For audiences, reboots allow easier entry for newcomers unfamiliar with earlier titles in a series.\n\nIn comic books, a long-running title may have its continuity erased in order to start over from the beginning, enabling writers to redefine characters and open up new story opportunities, and allowing the title to bring in new readers. Comic books sometimes use an in-universe explanation for a reboot, such as merging parallel worlds and timelines together, or destroying a fictional universe and recreating it from the beginning.\n\nWith reboots, filmmakers revamp and reinvigorate a film series in order to attract new fans and stimulate revenue. A reboot can renew interest in a series that has grown stale. Reboots act as a safe project for a studio, as a reboot with an established fanbase is less risky (in terms of expected profit) than an entirely original work, while at the same time allowing the studio to explore new demographics. Reboots also allow directors and producers to cast a new set of younger actors for the familiar roles of a film series in order to attract a younger audience. Unlike a remake, however, a reboot often presupposes a working familiarity on the part of the audience with the original work.\n\nIn television, a reboot of a TV show can be a return to production after cancellation and a long hiatus, but is also understood to mean a remake of an older series.\n\nReboots are common in the video game industry, particularly with franchises that have multiple entries in the series. Reboots in video games are used to refresh the storyline and elements of the game.\n\n"}
{"id": "1671672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1671672", "title": "Retrospective", "text": "Retrospective\n\nA retrospective (from Latin \"retrospectare\", \"look back\"), generally, is a look back at events that took place, or works that were produced, in the past. As a noun, \"retrospective\" has specific meanings in medicine, software development, popular culture and the arts. It is applied as an adjective, synonymous with the term \"retroactive\", to laws, standards, and awards.\n\nA medical retrospective is an examination of a patient's medical history and lifestyle.\n\nA retrospective exhibition presents works from an extended period of an artist's activity. Similarly, a retrospective compilation album is assembled from a recording artist's past material, usually their greatest hits. A television or newsstand special about an actor, politician, or other celebrity will present a retrospective of the subject's career highlights. A leading (usually elderly) academic may be honored with a Festschrift, an honorary book of articles or a lecture series relating topically to a retrospective of the honoree's career. Celebrity roasts good-naturedly mock the career of the guest of honor, often in a retrospective format.\n\nA retrospective or retroactive award is one which is created and then awarded to persons who would have received it before. Alternatively, a slight change to the criteria of an existing award may result in retrospective awards being presented to persons who would have won the award under present rules. Comparatively few awards are presented retrospectively.\n\nThe term is used in situations where the law (statutory, civil, or regulatory) is changed or reinterpreted, affecting acts committed before the alteration. When such changes make a previously committed lawful act now unlawful in a retroactive manner, this is known as an \"ex post facto\" law or retroactive law. Because such laws punish the accused for acts that were not unlawful when committed, they are rare, and not permissible in most legal systems. More commonly, changes retroactively worsen the legal consequences (or status) of actions that were committed, or relationships that existed, by bringing it into a more severe category than it was in when it was committed; by changing the punishment or recompense prescribed, as by adding new penalties, extending sentences, or increasing fines and damages payable; or it may alter the rules of evidence in order to make exoneration more difficult than it would have been.\n\nConversely, a form of retrospective law commonly called an amnesty law may decriminalize certain acts. A pardon has a similar effect, in a specific case instead of a class of cases. An \"in mitius\" change may alleviate possible consequences for unlawful acts (for example by replacing the death sentence with lifelong imprisonment) retroactively. Finally, when a previous law is repealed or otherwise nullified, it is no longer applicable to situations to which it had been, even if such situations arose before the law was voided; this principle is known as \"nullum crimen, nulla poena sine praevia lege poenali\".\n\nThe term is also used in software engineering, where a retrospective is a meeting held by a project team at the end of a project or process (often after an iteration) to discuss what was successful about the project or time period covered by that retrospective, what could be improved, and how to incorporate the successes and improvements in future iterations or projects. Retrospective can be done in many different ways.\n\nIn agile development, retrospectives play a very important role in iterative and incremental development. At the end of every iteration a retrospective is held to look for ways to improve the process for the next iteration. Scrum call this the Sprint Retrospective.\n\nIn the context of scientific and technical standards, retrospectivity applies current norms to material that pre-dates new rules. An example of a retrospective or retroactive standard is the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN Code), a convention which governs the formal scientific naming of animals, of which the 4th edition is effective since 2000. All previous editions of the ICZN Code, or previous other rules and conventions are disregarded today, and the scientific names published in former times are to be evaluated only under the present edition of the ICZN Code.\n\n"}

Skyscapes differ from cloudscapes because they do not necessarily include clouds. Like cloudscape art, skyscape art can also omit any view of land or anything else which might help to suggest scale or orientation. Images called \"skyscapes\" often do include clouds or land, but these things can also be excluded or kept to a minimum.\n\nThe view may be from earth or from a level far above. There is often nothing to suggest scale in the art, unless a bit of landscape is included or some phenomena such as the depiction of clouds, precipitation, rainbows and aurorae. Some artists also depict birds, insects and other flying objects, as well as manmade aircraft, kites and objects such as leaves, and balloons.\n\nThere are many examples of cloudless skies in painting, printmaking, serigraphy and photography. \n\nWeather is often an important element in the composition of skyscapes.\n\nThe sky is really nothing more than the denser gaseous zone of the earth’s atmosphere. Sky can be depicted as many different colors, such as a pale blue or the lack of any color at all, such as the night sky, which has the appearance of blackness, albeit with a scattering of stars on a clear night. During the day, the sky is seen as a deep blue due to the sunlight reflected on the air.\n\nAstronomically speaking, the sky is a celestial sphere–an imaginary dome divided into constellations–where the moon, planets, stars and sun seem to visually move across the sky.\n\nAlthough artists have long painted the sky it was Edward Hopper who first showed us the beauty of the skyscape, sans clouds. In the 1950s, Eric Sloane painted many cloudless skyscapes during his stay in Taos, New Mexico.\n\nAnother example of a cloudless skyscape artwork is the celestial ceiling mural at Grand Central Terminal in New York City.\n"}

Sound editing developed out of the need to fix the incomplete, undramatic, or technically inferior sound recordings of early talkies, and over the decades has become a respected filmmaking craft, with sound editors implementing the aesthetic goals of motion picture sound design.\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognizes the artistic contribution of exceptional sound editing with the Academy Award for Best Sound Editing.\n\nThere are primarily three divisions of sound that are combined to create a final mix, these being dialogue, effects, and music. In larger markets such as New York and Los Angeles, sound editors often specialize in only one of these areas, thus a show will have separate dialogue, effects, and music editors. In smaller markets, sound editors are expected to know how to handle it all, often crossing over into the mixing realm as well. Editing effects is likened to creating the sonic world from scratch, while dialogue editing is likened to taking the existing sonic world and fixing it. Dialogue editing is more accurately thought of as \"production sound editing\", where the editor takes the original sound recorded on the set, and using a variety of techniques, makes the dialogue more understandable, as well as smoother, so the listener doesn't hear the transitions from shot to shot (often the background sounds underneath the words change dramatically from take to take). Among the challenges that effects editors face are creatively adding together various elements to create believable sounds for everything you see on screen, as well as memorizing their sound effects library.\n\nThe essential piece of equipment used in modern sound editing is the digital audio workstation, or DAW. A DAW allows sounds, stored as computer files on a host computer, to be placed in timed synchronization with a motion picture, mixed, manipulated, and documented. The standard DAW system in use by the American film industry, as of 2012, is Avid's Pro Tools, with the majority running on Macs. Another system in use presently is Yamaha owned Steinberg's cross platform DAW Nuendo running on Macs using operating system Mac OS X but also on Windows XP. Other systems historically used for sound editing were:\n\nThe WaveFrame, Fairlights, and Audiofile were of the \"integrated\" variety of DAW, and required the purchase of expensive proprietary hardware and specialized computers (not standard PCs or Macs). Of the two surviving systems, Pro Tools still requires some proprietary hardware (either a low cost portable device such as the \"Mbox\" or the more expensive multichannel A/D,D/A converters for more professional high end applications), while Nuendo (a successor to Cubase) is of the \"host based\" variety.\n\nSound-effects editors typically use an organized catalog of sound recordings from which sound effects can be easily accessed and used in film soundtracks. There are several commercially distributed sound-effects libraries available, the two most well-known publishers being Sound Ideas and The Hollywood Edge. Online search engines, such as Sounddogs, A Sound Effect and Sonniss allow users to purchase sound effects libraries from a large online database.\n\nMany sound effects editors make their own customized sound recordings which are accumulated into highly prized personal sound effects libraries. Often, sound effects used in films will be saved and reused in subsequent films. One exemplary case in point is a recording known as the \"Wilhelm Scream\" which has become known for its repeated use in many famous films such as \"The Charge at Feather River\" (1953), Pierre Marette Story (1957), \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980), \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (1981), and \"Reservoir Dogs\" (1992). Credited with naming and popularizing this particular recording is sound designer Ben Burtt.\n\nThe first sound process to substantially displace silent films in the moviegoing market was the Vitaphone process. Under the Vitaphone process, a microphone recorded the sound performed on set directly to a phonograph master, which made Vitaphone recordings impossible to cut or resynchronize, as later processes would allow. This limited the Vitaphone process to capturing musical acts or one-take action scenes, like Vaudeville routines or other re-creations of stage performances; essentially, scenes that required no editing at all. However, Warner Brothers, even as early as \"The Jazz Singer\", began experimenting with the mixing of multiple phonograph recordings and intercutting between the \"master\" sync take and coverage of other angles. The original mixing console used to make the master recording of \"The Jazz Singer\", still viewable in the Warner Bros. Studio Museum, has no more than four or five knobs, but each is still visibly labeled with the basic \"groups\" that a modern sound designer would recognize: \"music\", \"crowd\", and so on.\n\nWarner Bros. developed increasingly sophisticated technology to sequence greater numbers of phonograph sound effects to picture using the Vitaphone system, but these were rendered obsolete with the widespread adoption of sound-on-film processes in the early 1930s.\n\nIn a sound-on-film process, a microphone captures sound and converts it into a signal that can be photographed on film. Since the recording is imposed linearly on the medium, and the medium is easily cut and glued, sounds recorded can be easily re-sequenced and separated onto separate tracks, allowing more control in mixing. Options expanded further when optical sound recording processes were replaced with magnetic recording in the 1950s. Magnetic recording offered a better signal-to-noise ratio, allowing more tracks to be played simultaneously without increasing noise on the full mix.\n\nThe greater number of options available to the editors led to more complex and creative sound tracks, and it was in this period that a set of standard practices became established which continued until the digital era, and many of the notional concepts are still at the core of sound design, computerized or not:\n\n\nHistorically the Dubbing Mixer (UK) or Re-Recording Mixer (US) was the specialist who mixed all the audio tracks supplied by the Dubbing Editor (with the addition of 'live sounds' such as Foley) in a special Dubbing Suite. As well as mixing, he would introduce equalization, compression and filtered sound effects, etc. while seated at a large console. Often two or three mixers would sit alongside, each controlling sections of audio, e.g., dialogue, music, effects.\n\nIn the era of optical sound tracks, it was difficult to mix more than eight tracks at once without accumulating excessive noise. At the height of magnetic recording, 200 tracks or more could be mixed together, aided by Dolby noise reduction. In the digital era there is no limit. For example, a single predub can exceed a hundred tracks, and the final dub can be the sum of a thousand tracks.\n\nThe mechanical system of sound editing remained unchanged until the early 1990s, when digital audio workstations acquired features sufficient for use in film production, mainly, the ability to synchronize with picture, and the ability to play back many tracks at once with CD-quality fidelity. The quality of 16-bit audio at a 48 kHz sampling rate allowed hundreds of tracks to be mixed together\nwith negligible noise.\n\nThe physical manifestation of the work became computerized: sound recordings, and the decisions the editors made in assembling them, were now digitized, and could be versioned, done, undone, and archived instantly and compactly. In the magnetic recording era, sound editors owned trucks to ship their tracks to a mixing stage, and transfers to magnetic film were measured in hundreds of thousands of feet. Once the materials arrived at the stage, a dozen recordists and mix technicians required a half an hour to load the three or four dozen tracks a predub might require. In the digital era, 250 hours of stereo sound, edited and ready to mix, can be transported on a single 160 GB hard drive. As well, this 250 hours of material can be copied in four hours or less, as opposed to the old system, which, predictably, would take 250 hours.\n\nBecause of these innovations, sound editors, as of 2005, face the same issues as other computerized, \"knowledge-based\" professionals, including the loss of work due to outsourcing to cheaper labor markets, and the loss of royalties due to ineffective enforcement of intellectual property rights.\n\nIn the field of animation, traditionally the sound editors have been given the more prestigious title of \"film editor\" in screen credits. As animated films are more often than not planned to the frame, the traditional functions of a film editor are often unnecessary. Treg Brown is known to cartoon fans as the sound effects genius of Warner Bros. Animation. Other greats of the field have included Jimmy MacDonald of the Walt Disney Studios, Greg Watson and Don Douglas at Hanna-Barbera, and Joe Siracusa of UPA and various TV cartoon studios.\n\nIn the production of radio programs and music, persons who manipulate sound recordings are known simply as \"editors\", in cases where the producers themselves do not perform the task.\n\n"}

Stamp catalogs are part of philatelic literature.\n\nThe first stamp catalog was published in France by Oscar Berger-Levrault on 17 September 1861 and the first illustrated catalog by Alfred Potiquet in December 1861 (based on the earlier work).\n\nThe first catalogs in Great Britain were published in 1862 by Frederick Booty, Mount Brown, and Dr. John Edward Gray. The first in the United States was \"The Stamp Collector's Manual\" by A.C. Kline (a pseudonym for John William Kline), also 1862.\n\nOriginally catalogs were just dealers' price lists, though today that is less common. The catalogs of some major publishers continue to serve as an official price list for the publisher. For example, Stanley Gibbons in the United Kingdom specifically states in the catalog that the price listed is the estimated selling price by Stanley Gibbons Ltd. On the other had, Scott in the United States does not sell stamps. Rather, the Scott catalog serves as a reference document for expected prices used by buyers and sellers. Over time, as philately developed, catalogs tended to accumulate additional supporting details about the stamps, such as dates of issue, color variations, and so forth. As their use by collectors became widespread, the catalogs came to define what was and was not a legitimate stamp, since many collectors would avoid stamps not described in the catalog. In recent years, the Internet has become a common resource for information about stamps. Some catalogs have an on-line version while others are available only on-line.\n\nThe following catalogs have a worldwide coverage:\n\nThese are large undertakings, since there are thousands of new stamps to describe each year, and the prices of all stamps may go up or down. For publishers that are not dealers, the prices are estimated by data from dealers and auctions.\n\nIn addition, the catalog publishers usually put out specialized volumes with additional details, generally by nationality: Michel has a specialized German catalog, Scott a specialized US catalog, and so forth.\n\nMany countries have their own \"national catalogs\", typically put out by a leading publisher or dealer in that country. Postal administrations may themselves put out catalogs, although they tend to be aimed at less-experienced collectors, and rarely provide fully detailed stamp data. Some notable country catalogs include:\n\n\n\n"}

Sony was a court case whose central focus was on whether violent video games played a role in Devin Moore's first-degree murder/shooting of three people in a police station. In August 2005, former attorney Jack Thompson filed the lawsuit against Sony.\n\nDevin Moore was convicted in 2005 for the 2003 shooting of two police officers and a dispatcher as he was being detained for allegedly stealing a car. He grabbed one officer's .45 caliber pistol and killed all three before fleeing the station in a police cruiser he stole from the station. He was eventually caught and sentenced to death by lethal injection.\n\nIn March 2005, Thompson announced he was filing a lawsuit on behalf of the families of two of the three victims in Fayette, Alabama. He was also featured in a \"60 Minutes\" special on the case.\n\nOn August 12, 2007, the third victim's family later joined the lawsuit.\n\nOn November 1, 2005, Thompson sent an email to various websites commenting on the opening day of the civil trial. In it, he compared Sony and Take-Two Interactive's sale of the \"Grand Theft Auto\" video game to Imperial Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II. According to Thompson, certain regional governments in Japan had prevented the sale of the \"Grand Theft Auto\" games to minors, though Sony continued to sell the game where its sale was not restricted in Japan and abroad (Microsoft is doing the same for its own video game console). Thompson also compared the distribution of violent games to the distribution of pornography.\n\nOn November 4, 2005, Blank Rome submitted a motion to have Thompson removed from the case, stating that Thompson would \"turn the courtroom into a circus.\"\n\nOn November 7, 2005, Thompson withdrew from the case, stating, \"It was my idea [to leave the case].\" He was quick to mention that the case would probably do well with or without his presence. This decision followed scrutiny from Judge James Moore; however, Thompson claimed he received no pressure to withdraw. At the same time, Judge Moore had taken the motion to revoke Thompson's license under advisement. Jack Thompson appeared in court to defend his right to practice law in Alabama \"(using Pro Hac Vice)\", following accusations that he violated legal ethics.\n\nJust before leaving the case, Thompson filed a motion with the court, quoting noted designer Warren Spector (\"Deus Ex\", \"Thief\") as being critical of Rockstar's actions, taken from a speech Spector gave at the Montreal International Game Summit. He even implied that Spector could be served a subpoena to testify, even though the court's jurisdiction did not extend to Spector's place of residence. On November 9, 2005, Spector lashed out at Thompson for taking his comments out of context, saying \"Take two or three things, from different contexts, mash them together and you can mislead people pretty dramatically.\" \n\nDevin Moore was apprehended several hours after the shootings in Mississippi. According to the Associated Press, after his recapture he said, \"Life is a video game. Everybody's got to die sometime.\" Once in custody, Moore quickly confessed. He told detectives that he shot the men because he didn't want to go to jail.\n\nMoore faced trial in 2005 and pleaded not guilty. The trial judge barred the defense from introducing evidence to the jury that \"Grand Theft Auto\" incited Moore's shooting spree. Moore's attorney, Jim Standridge, contended that Moore was suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder at the time of the crimes. Standridge argued that Moore had been emotionally and physically abused by his father as a child.\n\nIn August 2005, Moore was convicted as charged. On October 9, 2005, he was sentenced to death by lethal injection. Jim Standridge appealed the case. On February 17, 2012, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals upheld Moore's conviction in a 5-0 decision. The case will automatically be appealed to the Alabama Supreme Court, and can then be appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nOn November 18, 2005, Judge Moore rejected Thompson's request to withdraw, and instead revoked his \"Pro Hac Vice\" admission (a temporary license to practice in a given jurisdiction), in an 18-page decision. Thompson responded with a letter to Alabama's Judicial Inquiry Commission, questioning Judge Moore's ethics and accusing him of violating the first 3 Alabama Canons of Judicial Ethics Thompson also claimed the judge had \"absolutely no authority\" in preventing him from withdrawing from the case, and so therefore the court's decision to kick him off the case was a \"legal nullity\". He accused the court of punishing him for \"aggressively telling the truth\" while it \"looked the other way when Blank Rome elegantly told those lies.\"\n\nJudge Moore has also referred this matter to the Alabama State Bar for \"appropriate action\" remarking among other things: \"Mr. Thompson's actions before this Court suggest that he is unable to conduct himself in a manner befitting practice in this state.\" \n\nOn November 21, 2005, Thompson claimed that \"We had heard going into this civil case, before it was even filed, that a particular Western Alabama lawyer had to be part of our litigation team or Judge Moore would not give us a fair hearing. This lawyer himself claims, openly, that 'Judge Moore will not allow you to survive summary judgment if I am not on the case.' For too long we have heard swirling around this Judge allegations of improper influence.\" (sic) Thompson alluded that the \"fixer\" was local lawyer Clatus Junkin, although Junkin denied he had any influence over any judges, or that he had made such a comment, as he was \"not that dumb [...] or foolish enough to imply that [he] could [influence Judge Moore].\" He also declined Thompson's request to join the plaintiffs' team, citing disagreements over Thompson's demands of complete control of any contact with the news media. Judge Moore noted that even though he had banned comments on the case outside the courtroom, Thompson had issued 7 different communications between the start of the case and the day he revoked Thompson's \"Pro Hac Vice\". After being thrown off the case, Thompson requested that Judge Moore recuse himself from the case. Moore ignored him, stating \"I can’t consider it because he’s no longer practicing in the state of Alabama. If some other lawyer in the case asks me to recuse myself, I’ll consider it in court.\"\n\nOn December 13, 2005, Thompson announced that he will be \"assisting plaintiffs’ counsel during the discovery process and in the courtroom at trial\" when the civil trial begins in 2006 (the judge ruled on both Thompson's dismissal from the case, and dismissal of the case itself, during pretrial hearings). He also claimed he \"will likely be a witness in the case.\" Although he gave no details as to what he would be a witness to, except that he claimed he had \"warned, in writing,\" Take-Two and Rockstar Games \"that murders such as those in Alabama would occur by teens who had rehearsed the murders on their virtual reality killing simulators.\" It should be noted though, that Judge Moore forbade Thompson from \"[communicating] with the court or the judge\" or he \"would be held in contempt of court.\" While that order was appealed, it has not yet been ruled on.\n\nOn February 16, 2006, Thompson sent a letter to the Alabama Bar, accusing Judge Moore of breaking the bar rules by publicly disclosing that he had filed a complaint about Thompson with the Alabama Bar. He accused Judge Moore of denying Devin Moore a fair trial, and claimed the FBI was investigating the Florida Bar's \"disciplinary process\". Thompson gave the Alabama Bar until \"five o’clock p.m., Eastern time, February 17, 2006\" to drop the complaint, or else he would file a \"federal lawsuit in the United States District Court in the Southern District of Florida on Monday, February 20, 2006.\" \n\nThe Alabama State Bar rules state that a court official who revokes Pro Hac Vice due to conduct must refer the matter to the Bar for review, and the Bar decides if an investigation is needed. No complaint is required to open an investigation.\n\nThompson's deadline of February 17 passed, without action from either party.\n\nOn February 22, 2006, Thompson followed up with another letter, announcing that he had filed a lawsuit against the Alabama Bar, for investigating a complaint \" which in fact was not even filed\" in \"violation of its own Bar Rules.\" \n\nThe Alabama Bar has not yet been served notice with any complaint from Thompson, nor has any Florida court acknowledged a civil suit being filed.\n\nThompson announced that the \"Strickland v. Sony\" plaintiffs were still his clients, and vowed to represent them in-court when the trial resumes.\n\nOn October 9, 2007, Thompson filed a lawsuit against the Alabama Bar with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The case has been assigned to the same judge who has had previously presided over attempts by Thompson to sue the Florida Bar, which were voluntarily withdrawn. Thompson claimed that his rights of \"speech, petition, and religion\" were violated when his \"Pro Hac Vice\" status was revoked.\n\nOn March 29, 2006, the Alabama Supreme Court upheld Judge Moore's ruling against the dismissal of the case. Law firm Blank-Rome, representing the defendants, had previously attempted unsuccessfully to have the suit dismissed during the pre-trial since it argued that the defendants had a right under the 1st Amendment to sell mature games to minors. At the time of the sale, there was no law preventing such a sale. Thompson called the ruling \"exciting\" because \"no one has ever before survived a motion to dismiss.\" At the same time, the Alabama Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments as to whether the Fayette County Court had the jurisdiction to preside over the case at all.\n\n"}

{"id": "42390267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42390267", "title": "The Peel Players", "text": "The Peel Players\n\nThe Peel Players were an amateur theatre group from the Isle of Man in operation during the 1910s and specialising in Anglo-Manx dialect productions.\n\nThrough the initiation of Sophia Morrison, the group met for the first time in July 1912 at Christian Street School, Peel. They commenced playing in 1913 with Christopher R. Shimmin as producer.\n\nOn 13 January 1913 the Players premiered Shimmin's short Manx dialect play, \"Illiam Kodhere's Will\", in the Gaiety Theatre in Douglas. The Players then took their production of this and another of Shimmin's plays, \"The Charm\", to the David Lewis' Theatre in Liverpool. It was reported of this performance (by Sophia Morrison) that \"There was a crowded house. The Liverpool newspapers gave unstinted praise to both plays and players.\" In the winter of that same year, the Players did a production of Shimmin's next plays, \"Luss ny Graih\" and \"The Dooinney Moyllee\".\n\nThe Players were keen to use the profits from their performances for charitable purposes in line with their Manx ideals. This included a donation of £52 in 1913 to The Manx Society, for \"the publication of Manx books and music, music prizes, and so forth,\" at a time when the Society was in desperate need of money, and a donation in 1915 to help fund the provision of copies of T. E. Brown's poems for all schools on the island.\n\nWhen World War I broke out, \"Mannin\" reported that: \"The Peel Players' revenue had been devoted to war objects, so that their work had been somewhat curtailed for lack of funds.\" This continued for the following year, when \"Mannin\" reported that the Players:\n\"have this season given their profits to war funds, or for gifts to Peel men on active service and in training; £10 went to Douglas Needlework Fund, £10 to Douglas Belgian Hostel, £5 8s. to Ramsey Belgian Hostel, and the rest to Peel men serving on sea or land.\"\nIt was only two years after this, in January 1917, that Sophia Morrison, the inspiration behind the Players, died. The central connection between Morrison and the Players was demonstrated by some of their members forming her pallbearers: John J. Joughin, Christopher R. Shimmin, C. Cashin and C. H. Cowley. The Peel Players did not last long beyond this time.\n\nPeople who acted with the Peel Players include: Christopher R. Shimmin, William B. Meyrick, John J. Joughin, Evelyn Christian, Amy Preston, C. Cashin, C. H. Cowley, W. H. Crellin, John W. Kelly, Hilda Vick, Amelia Keegan, Lionel Lucas, Charles W. Palmer, Tom Dodd, Sam Harrison and Annie V. Cain.\n\nAlthough the Peel Players were only a small amateur group, they are perhaps the most significant theatre group in modern Manx history. Through their central place in the Manx Cultural Revival and their premiering works by perhaps the island's most important playwright, in Christopher R. Shimmin, the Peel Players have been compared to the Abbey Theatre in Dublin for their significance to Manx culture.\n\nIt had also been hoped that the Players could stage productions of \"Catchin Kirree\" by F. Corris and \"Ellie's Stranger\" by W. Clucas Kinley, but the onset of the First World War disrupted these plans.\n"}
{"id": "32302243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32302243", "title": "The Procuress (Dirck van Baburen)", "text": "The Procuress (Dirck van Baburen)\n\nThe Procuress is the name given to a number of similar paintings by the Dutch Golden Age painter Dirck van Baburen. The painting is in the Caravaggiesque style of the Utrecht school.\n\nThe painting shows three figures, a prostitute on the left, the client in the middle and the procuress on the right pointing to her palm to indicate that she is expecting payment. The client is holding a coin between his fingers as he puts his arm around the prostitute, who is playing a lute. The painting is an example of the popular genre known as \"Bordeeltjes\", or brothel scenes (see also the overlapping genre of Merry company scenes). The cropped, close-up figures close to the picture plane against a flat blank background are typical of Utrecht Caravaggism.\n\nThere are at least three versions of the painting. The versions in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston are attributed to Dirck van Baburen or his studio. One copy of the painting was owned by Maria Thins, mother-in-law of Johannes Vermeer, who reproduced it in the background of two of his own paintings. A copy owned by the Courtauld Institute in London has been identified as the work of the forger Han van Meegeren. This was featured in the third episode of the BBC TV series, \"Fake or Fortune?\".\n\nOne of these paintings was owned by Vermeer's mother-in-law, and it may have been an influence on one of his own early paintings on a similar subject, also known as \"The Procuress\" (1656). It also appears in the background of two of Vermeer's later paintings, \"The Concert\" (c.1664) and \"Lady Seated at a Virginal\" (c.1670). In both of these later paintings the blatant lust depicted by Baburen is contrasted with the genteel, but erotically charged, middle-class world occupied by Vermeer's women. The contrast between the images may also imply \"a more general association between music and love\". Vermeer sets up a series of contrasts between his own delicate, restrained style and Baburen's vulgar realism. According to Michael Wayne Cole and Mary Pardo this represents Vermeer's own move away from such low-life subjects. The older, cruder style of Baburen is relegated to the background, \"eclipsing it with the more modern kind of genteel subject that Vermeer would soon paint exclusively\".\n\nIn 1960, Geoffrey Webb presented a version of the painting to the Courtauld Institute. At the end of the Second World War, he had been an allied officer in Europe investigating art works looted by the Nazis. He believed it was a fake painted by Han van Meegeren, and he presented it to the Courtauld as such. In his own defense, van Meegeren claimed that the painting had been bought in an antique shop by his wife. Although the painting was initially believed to be a fake, its authenticity remained controversial, and in 2009 a scientific study indicated that the painting was likely to be genuine, as no modern pigments were found. A spokesperson for the gallery stated that they were \"surprised\" by the results, but that the evidence indicated that it was \"likely to be a 17th-century painting\". \n\nFollowing this, the BBC TV programme \"Fake or Fortune?\" conducted a further investigation. The resulting film was first shown July 2011. Philip Mould and Fiona Bruce traveled to Amsterdam where they obtained samples of the paints used by van Meegeren. These included an artificial resin which turned out to be Bakelite. The use of Bakelite had the effect of hardening the paint and thus making it difficult to detect that it was new. Chemical analysis showed Bakelite in the Courtauld painting, thus confirming that it was a modern forgery. Van Meegeren is the only forger known to have used this technique, so the painting was attributed to him. It was probably intended to be used as a prop in Vermeer forgeries. It is more valuable as a van Meegeren forgery than as a 17th-century studio copy.\n\n"}
{"id": "6601873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6601873", "title": "Theatrical technician", "text": "Theatrical technician\n\nA \"theatrical technician\", (variably known as a tech, techie, technician, theatre tech or theatre technician) is a person who operates technical equipment and systems in the performing arts and entertainment industry. In contrast to performers, this broad category contains all \"unseen\" theatrical personnel who practice stagecraft and are responsible for the logistic and production-related aspects of a performance including designers, operators, and supervisors. Many professional designers and technicians consider the diminutive \"techie\" to be offensive.\n\nTheatrical responsibilities taken by technicians include:\nA single theatrical technician may regularly do one or more of the above jobs during load in, load outs (strike), rehearsal and performance. Performance technicians are generally divided between those backstage (stagehands, Stage Managers) and those in a control room (lighting and audio technicians). During load in and load out additional crew members may be needed due to the amount of work required to be completed in a short time span. Larger and more complex shows require larger crews and often personnel with specialized advanced skills to perform these job functions.\n\nThe position may be volunteer or a paid position. It is not uncommon to receive compensation (such as comp/free tickets to the current or future productions or items used in the show) in other forms than money for pay. This type of compensation allows the person working to receive value for their services while not costing the producer more out-of-pocket expenses. Theatrical technicians are represented by the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees in the United States.\n\nStagecraft and technicians can be classified into departments and jobs as follows. Not all productions will have all departments or jobs filled, and, in many cases, one technician will perform multiple jobs (even if only possessing one title).\n\n\nThis is the general name for all work involving scenery, including the deck (floor) of the stage.\n\nThis department is responsible for all of the onstage lighting for a show including, but not limited to, practicals, stage lighting and followspots. Electricians are responsible for the assembly, installation, operation and maintenance of the lighting for a production. The Electrics department is also typically in charge of any fog or haze machines used during a production, as well as the configuration of pyrotechnics and other special hardware.\n\n\nThis department is responsible for all equipment hung (flown) in the theater space. This department varies greatly from show to show, sometimes being absorbed into the Electrics or Carpentry departments. If the production incorporates personnel flying (such as in the staging of Peter Pan), there will usually be designated riggers specifically trained in flying actors. Rigging techniques and traditions come from sailing. Sailors were considered the earliest stagehands in history and many techniques used today for rigging in the theater are from standard uses on boats. Theater technicians today have also incorporated techniques from mountain climbers as well to improve the capabilities of flying equipment in the air. \n\nA theater consists of four basic rigging systems such as: hemp house, single purchase, double purchase and truss. Proper knowledge of the basic rigging systems by theater technicians is how scenery is properly built and hung over people's heads for productions. The hemp house is where all the ropes are housed in the theater and are counterweighted with sandbags. Whereas a single purchase is where the loading floor is on the stage floor in order to reduce the amount of staged space in the wings. A double purchase system works quite differently compared to a single purchase because it puts the loading floor halfway between the stage floor and the loft blocks. The truss is considered as to be the most important rigging system in theater because it consists of two or more pieces of pipe fabricated together with cross bracing. The purpose of the truss is to replace standard pipes for extremely heavy loads to be lifted. \n\nThe properties department is responsible for all hand and scenic props for a show. This usually includes furniture, weaponry and consumables (paper, food and drink) for a production. In addition to the above duties, the props department is responsible for the cleanliness of the stage floor, including sweeping and mopping of the stage surface.\n\nThe audio department is responsible for all sound production for a show, including the configuration of microphones, speakers and control equipment, as well as the production of any necessary audio tracks. Personnel in this department include:\n\n\nA rarely seen department in theatre due to the heavy restrictions on the use of true pyrotechnics and is sometimes combined with other tech departments (usually the Electrics department) is referred to as special effects. Theatrical technicians are responsible for the production and operation of explosives, special effects and illusions on sufficiently large theatrical productions. Today many of the special effects used on stage have been modernized and are extremely advanced the most commonly used effects are nature, fire, fog and haze. In order to make special effects seem more realistic on stage technicians use innovative techniques and special equipment to bring the production to life across the stage. For nature effects like wind, fans are commonly used to bring movement on stage by adjusting the speed and direction of the fan. For effects like fire, equipment is brought in to create flames and smoke and is usually operated by a licensed special effects operator. Whereas fog and haze machines are easy and accessible for technicians to use and only require fluid to be placed inside the machine to vaporize into fog and haze. These machines also have functions where the flow and speed of the fog and haze can be adjusted to control how its distributed throughout a production.\n\nThe stage manager is in control of a production during its run. Responsibilities include calling the cues and determining the starting time of the show and ensuring the safety of all persons involved. Depending on circumstances, multiple positions are possible:\n\nResponsible for the creation and maintenance of costume pieces and dressing the performers.\n\n\n"}

In 1886, the magazine's headquarters moved from Manchester to London where it paved the way for popular journalism — most significantly, the \"Daily Mail\" was founded by Alfred Harmsworth, a contributor to \"Tit-Bits\", and the \"Daily Express\" was launched by Arthur Pearson, who worked at \"Tit-Bits\" for five years after winning a competition to get a job on the magazine.\n\nFrom the outset, the magazine was a mass-circulation commercial publication on cheap newsprint which soon reached sales of between 400,000 and 600,000. Like a mini-encyclopedia it presented a diverse range of tit-bits of information in an easy-to-read format, with the emphasis on human interest stories concentrating on drama and sensation. It also featured short stories and full-length fiction, including works by authors such as Rider Haggard and Isaac Asimov, plus three very early stories by Christopher Priest.\n\nThe first humorous article by P. G. Wodehouse, \"Men Who Missed Their Own Weddings\", appeared in \"Tit-Bits\" in November 1900. During the first world war Ivor Novello won a \"Titbits\" competition to write a song soldiers could sing at the front: he penned \"Keep the Home Fires Burning\".\n\nPin-ups appeared on the magazine's covers from 1939 and by 1955 circulation peaked at 1,150,000. At the beginning of 1973 \"Tit-Bits\" lost the hyphen from its masthead. In 1979 \"Reveille\" (a weekly tabloid with a virtually identical demographic) was merged into \"Titbits\", and the magazine was briefly rebranded as \"Titbits incorporating Reveille\". This however was dropped in July 1981. On 18 July 1984, under its last editor Paul Hopkins, \"Titbits\" was selling only 170,000 copies and was taken over by Associated Newspapers' \"Weekend\". At the time, the \"Financial Times\" described \"Titbits\" as “the 103-year-old progenitor of Britain's popular press”. \"Weekend\" itself closed in 1989.\n\nIn \"All Things Considered\" by G. K. Chesterton, the author contrasts \"Tit-Bits\" with the \"Times\", saying: \"Let any honest reader... ask himself whether he would really rather be asked in the next two hours to write the front page of \"The Times\", which is full of long leading articles, or the front page of \"Tit-Bits\", which is full of short jokes.\" Reference to the magazine is also made in James Joyce's \"Ulysses\", George Orwell's \"Animal Farm\", James Hilton's \"Lost Horizon\", Virginia Woolf's \"Moments of Being\", H. G. Wells' \"The First Men in the Moon\" and AJ Cronin's \"The Stars Look Down\". It has been also mentioned in Stanley Houghton's play The Dear Departed. Wells also mentioned it in his book \"Experiment in Autobiography\". The magazine is burlesqued as \"Chit Chat\" in George Gissing's \"New Grub Street\". In the closing scene of the film \"Kind Hearts and Coronets\" (1949), the protagonist Louis Mazzini (Dennis Price) is approached by a journalist (Arthur Lowe) from \"Tit-Bits\".\n\nThe magazine name survived as a glossy adult monthly \"Titbits International\".\n\n"}
{"id": "149031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=149031", "title": "Victorian fashion", "text": "Victorian fashion\n\nVictorian fashion comprises the various fashions and trends in British culture that emerged and developed in the United Kingdom and the British Empire throughout the Victorian era, roughly from the 1830s through the first decade of the 1900s. The period saw many changes in fashion, including changes in styles, fashion technology and the methods of distribution. Various movement in architecture, literature, and the decorative and visual arts as well as a changing perception of the traditional gender roles also influenced fashion\n\nUnder Queen Victoria's rule, England enjoyed a period of economic growth along with technological advancement. Mass production of sewing machines in the 1850s as well as the advent of synthetic dyes introduced major changes in fashion. Clothing could be made quicker and more cheaply. Advancement in printing and proliferation of fashion magazines allowed the masses to participate in the evolving trends of high fashion, opening the market of mass consumption and advertising. By 1905, clothing was increasingly factory made and often sold in large, fixed-price department stores, spurring a new age of consumerism with the rising middle class who benefited from the industrial revolution.\n\nDuring the Victorian Era, women generally worked in the private, domestic sphere. Unlike in earlier centuries when women would often help their husbands and brothers in family businesses and in labour, during the nineteenth century, gender roles became more defined. The requirement for farm labourers was no longer in such a high demand after the Industrial Revolution, and women were more likely to perform domestic work or, if married, give up work entirely. Dress reflected this new, increasingly sedentary lifestyle, and was not intended to be utilitarian.\n\nClothes were seen as an expression of women’s place in society and were hence, differentiated in terms of social class. Upper class women, who did not need to work, often wore a tightly laced corset over a bodice or chemisette, and paired them with a skirt adorned with numerous embroideries and trims; over layers of petticoats. Middle class women exhibited similar dress styles; however, the decorations were not as extravagant. The layering of these garments make them very heavy. Corsets were also stiff and restricted movement. Although the clothes were not comfortable, the type of fabrics and the in-numerous layers were worn as a symbol of wealth.\n\nNeck-line\nBertha is the low shoulder neck-line worn by women during the Victorian Era. The cut exposed a woman’s shoulders and it sometimes was trimmed over with a three to six inch deep lace flounce, or the bodice has neckline draped with several horizontal bands of fabric pleats. However, the exposure of neck-line was only restricted to the upper and middle class, working class women during the time period were not allowed to reveal so much flesh.\nThe décolleté style made shawls to become an essential feature of dresses. Corsets lost their shoulder straps, and fashion was to produce two bodices, one closed décolletage for day and one décolleté for evening.\n\nBoning\nCorsets were used in women’s gowns for emphasizing the small waist of the female body. They function as an undergarment which can be adjusted to bound tightly around the waist, hold and train a person’s waistline, so to slim and conform it to a fashionable silhouette. It also helped stop the bodice from horizontal creasing. With the corset, a very small tight fitting waist would be shown.\nYet, corsets have been blamed for causing lots of diseases because of the tight waist bound. Ill condition examples were curvature of the spine, deformities of the ribs and birth defects. As a result, people started to oppose the use of corsets in later times.\nSleeves\nSleeves were tightly fit during the early Victorian era. It matched with the tight fit women’s small waist in the design, and the shoulder sleeve seamline was drooped more to show a tighter fit on the arm. This eventually limited women’s movements with the sleeves. \nHowever, as crinolines started to develop in fashion, sleeves turned to be like large bells which gave the dress a heavier volume. Engageantes, which were usually made of lace, linen, or lawn, with cambric and broderie anglaise, were worn under the sleeves. They were easy to remove, launder and restitch into position, so to act as false sleeves, which was tacked to the elbow-length sleeves during the time. They commonly appear under the bell-shaped sleeves of day dresses.\n\nSilhouette\nSilhouette changed over time supported by the evolution of the undergarment. In earlier days, wide skirts were supported by fabrics like linen which used horsehair in the weave. Crinolines were used to give skirts a beehive shape, with at least six layers petticoats worn under the skirt, which could weigh as much as fourteen pounds. \nLater, the cage crinoline was developed. Women were freed from the heavy petticoats, and were able to move their legs freely beneath the cage.\nSilhouette later began to emphasise a slope toward the back of the skirt. Polonaise style was introduced where fullness bunched up at the back of the skirt. Crinolines and cages also started to disappear with it being more dangerous to working class women. Tournures or bustles were developed.\n\nDuring the start of Queen Victoria’s reign in 1837, the ideal shape of the Victorian woman was a long slim torso emphasised by wide hips. To achieve a low and slim waist, corsets were tightly laced and extended over the abdomen and down towards the hips. A chemise was commonly worn under the corset, and cut relatively low in order to prevent exposure. Over the corset, was the tight-fitting bodice featuring a low waistline. Along with the bodice was a long skirt, featuring layers of horsehair petticoats worn underneath to create fullness; while placing emphasis on the small waist. To contrast the narrow waist, low and straight necklines were thus used.\n\nIn the 1840s, collapsed sleeves, low necklines, elongated V-shaped bodices, and fuller skirts characterised the dress styles of women.\n\nAt the start of the decade, the sides of bodices stopped at the natural waistline, and met at a point in the front. In accordance with the heavily boned corset and seam lines on the bodice as well, the popular low and narrow waist was thus accentuated.\n\nSleeves of bodices were tight at the top, because of the Mancheron, but expanded around the area between the elbow and before the wrist. It was also initially placed below the shoulder, however; this restricted the movements of the arm.\n\nAs a result, the middle of the decade saw sleeves flaring out from the elbow into a funnel shape; requiring undersleeves to be worn in order to cover the lower arms.\n\nSkirts lengthened, while widths increased due to the introduction of the horsehair crinoline in 1847; becoming a status symbol of wealth.\n\nExtra layers of flounces and petticoats, also further emphasised the fullness of these wide skirts. In compliance with the narrow waist though, skirts were therefore attached to bodices using very tight organ pleats secured at each fold. This served as a decorative element for a relatively plain skirt. The 1840s style was perceived as conservative and \"Gothic\" compared to the flamboyance of the 1830s.\n\nA similar silhouette remained in the 1850s, while certain elements of garments changed.\n\nNecklines of day dresses dropped even lower into a V-shape, causing a need to cover the bust area with a chemisette. In contrast, evening dresses featured a Bertha, which completely exposed the shoulder area instead. Bodices began to extend over the hips, while the sleeves opened further and increased in fullness. The volume and width of the skirt continued to increase, especially during 1853, when rows of flounces were added.\n\nNevertheless, in 1856, skirts expanded even further; creating a dome shape, due to the invention of the first artificial cage crinoline. The purpose of the crinoline was to create an artificial hourglass silhouette by accentuating the hips, and fashioning an illusion of a small waist; along with the corset. The cage crinoline was constructed by joining thin metal strips together to form a circular structure that could solely support the large width of the skirt. This was made possible by technology which allowed iron to be turned into steel, which could then be drawn into fine wires. Although often ridiculed by journalists and cartoonists of the time as the crinoline swelled in size, this innovation freed women from the heavy weight of petticoats and was a much more hygienic option.\n\nMeanwhile, the invention of synthetic dyes added new colours to garments and women experimented with gaudy and bright colours. Technological innovation of 1860s provided women with freedom and choices.\n\nDuring the early and middle 1860s, crinolines began decreasing in size at the top, while retaining their amplitude at the bottom. In contrast, the shape of the crinoline became flatter in the front and more voluminous behind, as it moved towards the back since skirts consisted of trains now. Bodices on the other hand, ended at the natural waistline, had wide pagoda sleeves, and included high necklines and collars for day dresses; low necklines for evening dresses. However, in 1868, the female silhouette had slimmed down as the crinoline was replaced by the bustle, and the supporting flounce overtook the role of determining the silhouette. Skirt widths diminished even further, while fullness and length remained at the back. In order to emphasise the back, the train was gathered together to form soft folds and draperies\n\nThe trend for broad skirts slowly disappeared during the 1870s, as women started to prefer an even slimmer silhouette. Bodices remained at the natural waistline, necklines varied, while sleeves began under the shoulder line. An overskirt was commonly worn over the bodice, and secured into a large bow behind. Over time though, the overskirt shortened into a detached basque, resulting in an elongation of the bodice over the hips. As the bodices grew longer in 1873, the polonaise was thus introduced into the Victorian dress styles. A polonaise is a garment featuring both an overskirt and bodice together. The tournure was also introduced, and along with the polonaise, it created an illusion of an exaggerated rear end.\n\nBy 1874, skirts began to taper in the front and were adorned with trimmings, while sleeves tightened around the wrist area. Towards 1875 to 1876, bodices featured long but even tighter laced waists, and converged at a sharp point in front. Bustles lengthened and slipped even lower, causing the fullness of the skirt to further diminish. Extra fabric was gathered together behind in pleats, thus creating a narrower but longer tiered, draped train too. Due to the longer trains, petticoats had to be worn underneath in order to keep the dress clean.\n\nHowever, when 1877 approached, dresses moulded to fit the figure, as increasing slimmer silhouettes were favoured. This was allowed by the invention of the cuirass bodice which functions like a corset, but extends downwards to the hips and upper thighs. Although dress styles took on a more natural form, the narrowness of the skirt limited the wearer in regards to walking.\n\nThe early 1880s was a period of stylistic confusion. On one hand, there is the over-ornamented silhouette with contrasting texture and frivolous accessories. On the other hand, the growing popularity of tailoring gave rise to an alternative, severe style. Some credited the change in silhouette to the Victorian dress reform, which consisted of a few movements including the Aesthetic Costume Movement and the Rational Dress Movement in the mid-to-late Victorian Era advocating natural silhouette, lightweight underwear, and rejecting tightlacing. However, these movements did not gain widespread support. Others noted the growth in cycling and tennis as acceptable feminine pursuits that demanded a greater ease of movement in women's clothing. Still others argued that the growing popularity of tailored semi-masculine suits was simply a fashionable style, and indicated neither advanced views nor the need for practical clothes. Nonetheless, the diversification in options and adoption of what was considered menswear at that time coincided with growing power and social status of women towards the late-Victorian period.\n\nThe bustle made a re-appearance in 1883, and it featured a further exaggerated horizontal protrusion at the back. Due to the additional fullness, drapery moved towards the sides or front panel of the skirt instead. Any drapery at the back was lifted up into poufs. Bodices on the other hand, shortened and ended above the hips. Yet the style remained tailored, but was more structured.\n\nHowever, by 1886, the silhouette transformed back to a slimmer figure again. Sleeves of bodices were thinner and tighter, while necklines became higher again. Furthermore, an even further tailored-look began to develop until it improved in the 1890s.\n\nBy 1890, the crinoline and bustle was fully abandoned, and skirts flared away naturally from the wearer’s tiny waist. It evolved into a bell shape, and were made to fit tighter around the hip area. Necklines were high, while sleeves of bodices initially peaked at the shoulders, but increased in size during 1894. Although the large sleeves required cushions to secure them in place, it narrowed down towards the end of the decade. Women thus adopted the style of the tailored jacket, which improved their posture and confidence, while reflecting the standards of early female liberation.\n\nHats (and gloves) were crucial to a respectable appearance for both men and women. To go bareheaded was simply not proper. The top hat, for example, was standard formal wear for upper- and middle-class men. For women, the styles of hats changed over time and were designed to match their outfits.\nDuring the early Victorian decades, voluminous skirts held up with crinolines, and then hoop skirts, were the focal point of the silhouette. To enhance the style without distracting from it, hats were modest in size and design, straw and fabric bonnets being the popular choice. Poke bonnets, which had been worn during the late Regency period, had high, small crowns and brims that grew larger until the 1830s, when the face of a woman wearing a poke bonnet could only be seen directly from the front. They had rounded brims, echoing the rounded form of the bell-shaped hoop skirts.\n\nThe silhouette changed once again as the Victorian era drew to a close. The shape was essentially an inverted triangle, with a wide-brimmed hat on top, a full upper body with puffed sleeves, no bustle, and a skirt that narrowed at the ankles (the hobble skirt was a fad shortly after the end of the Victorian era). The enormous wide-brimmed hats were covered with elaborate creations of silk flowers, ribbons, and above all, exotic plumes; hats sometimes included entire exotic birds that had been stuffed. Many of these plumes came from birds in the Florida everglades, which were nearly made entirely extinct by overhunting. By 1899, early environmentalists like Adeline Knapp were engaged in efforts to curtail the hunting for plumes. By 1900, more than five million birds a year were being slaughtered, and nearly 95 percent of Florida's shore birds had been killed by plume hunters.\n\nThe women's shoes of the early Victorian period were narrow and heelless, in black or white satin. By 1850s and 1860s, they were slightly broader with a low heel and made of leather or cloth. Ankle-length laced or buttoned boots were also popular. From the 1870s to the twentieth century, heels grew higher and toes more pointed. Low-cut pumps were worn for the evening.\n\nDuring the 1840s, men wore tight-fitting, calf length frock coats and a waistcoat or vest. The vests were single- or double-breasted, with shawl or notched collars, and might be finished in double points at the lowered waist. For more formal occasions, a cutaway morning coat was worn with light trousers during the daytime, and a dark tail coat and trousers was worn in the evening. Shirts were made of linen or cotton with low collars, occasionally turned down, and were worn with wide cravats or neck ties. Trousers had fly fronts, and breeches were used for formal functions and when horseback riding. Men wore top hats, with wide brims in sunny weather.\n\nDuring the 1850s, men started wearing shirts with high upstanding or turnover collars and four-in-hand neckties tied in a bow, or tied in a knot with the pointed ends sticking out like \"wings\". The upper-class continued to wear top hats, and bowler hats were worn by the working class.\n\nIn the 1860s, men started wearing wider neckties that were tied in a bow or looped into a loose knot and fastened with a stickpin. Frock coats were shortened to knee-length and were worn for business, while the mid-thigh length sack coat slowly displaced the frock coat for less-formal occasions. Top hats briefly became the very tall \"stovepipe\" shape, but a variety of other hat shapes were popular.\n\nDuring the 1870s, three-piece suits grew in popularity along with patterned fabrics for shirts. Neckties were the four-in-hand and, later, the Ascot ties. A narrow ribbon tie was an alternative for tropical climates, especially in the Americas. Both frock coats and sack coats became shorter. Flat straw boaters were worn when boating.\n\nDuring the 1880s, formal evening dress remained a dark tail coat and trousers with a dark waistcoat, a white bow tie, and a shirt with a winged collar. In mid-decade, the dinner jacket or tuxedo, was used in more relaxed formal occasions. The Norfolk jacket and tweed or woolen breeches were used for rugged outdoor pursuits such as shooting. Knee-length topcoats, often with contrasting velvet or fur collars, and calf-length overcoats were worn in winter. Men's shoes had higher heels and a narrow toe.\n\nStarting from the 1890s, the blazer was introduced, and was worn for sports, sailing, and other casual activities.\n\nThroughout much of the Victorian era most men wore fairly short hair. This was often accompanied by various forms of facial hair including moustaches, side-burns, and full beards. A clean-shaven face did not come back into fashion until the end of the 1880s and early 1890s.\n\nDistinguishing what men really wore from what was marketed to them in periodicals and advertisements is problematic, as reliable records do not exist.\n\nIn Britain, black is the colour traditionally associated with mourning for the dead. The customs and etiquette expected of men, and especially women, were rigid during much of the Victorian era. The expectations depended on a complex hierarchy of close or distant relationship with the deceased. The closer the relationship, the longer the mourning period and the wearing of black. The wearing of full black was known as First Mourning, which had its own expected attire, including fabrics, and an expected duration of 4 to 18 months. Following the initial period of First Mourning, the mourner would progress to Second Mourning, a transition period of wearing less black, which was followed by Ordinary Mourning, and then Half-mourning. Some of these stages of mourning were shortened or skipped completely if the mourner's relationship to the deceased was more distant. Half-mourning was a transition period when black was replaced by acceptable colours such as lavender and mauve, possibly considered acceptable transition colours because of the tradition of Church of England (and Catholic) clergy wearing lavender or mauve stoles for funeral services, to represent the Passion of Christ.\n\n\"Manners and Rules of Good Society, or, Solecisms to be Avoided\" (London, Frederick Warne & Co., 1887) gives clear instructions, such as the following:\n\nThe complexity of these etiquette rules extends to specific mourning periods and attire for siblings, step-parents, aunts and uncles distinguished by blood and by marriage, nieces, nephews, first and second cousins, children, infants, and \"connections\" (who were entitled to ordinary mourning for a period of \"1–3 weeks, depending on level of intimacy\"). Men were expected to wear mourning black to a lesser extent than women, and for a shorter mourning period. After the mid-19th century, men would wear a black hatband and black suit, but for only half the prescribed period of mourning expected of women. Widowers were expected to mourn for a mere three months, whereas the proper mourning period expected for widows was up to four years. Women who mourned in black for longer periods were accorded great respect in public for their devotion to the departed, the most prominent example being Queen Victoria herself.\n\nWomen with lesser financial means tried to keep up with the example being set by the middle and upper classes by dyeing their daily dress. Dyers made most of their income during the Victorian period by dyeing clothes black for mourning.\n\nTechnological advancements not only influenced the economy but brought a major change in the fashion styles worn by men and women. As the Victorian era was based on the principles of gender, race and class. Much advancement was in favor of the upper class as they were the ones who could afford the latest technology and change their fashion styles accordingly. In 1830s there was introduction of horse hair crinoline that became a symbol of status and wealth as only the upper class women could wear it. In 1850s there were more fashion technological advancements hence 1850s could rightly be called a revolution in the Victorian fashion industry such as the innovation of artificial cage crinoline that gave women an artificial hourglass silhouette this meant that women did not have to wear layers of petticoats anymore to achieve illusion of wide hips and it was also hygienic. Synthetic dyes were also introduced that added new bright colours to garments. These technological advancement gave women freedom and choices. In 1855's \"Haute couture\" was introduced as tailoring became more mainstream in years to follow.\n\nCharles Frederick Worth, a prominent English designer, became popular amongst the upper class though its city of destiny always is Paris. Haute couture became popular at the same time when sewing machines were invented. Hand sewn techniques arose and were a distinction in compared to the old ways of tailoring. Princess Eugenie of France wore the Englishman dressmaker, Charles Frederick Worth's couture and he instantly became famous in France though he had just arrived in Paris a few years ago. In 1855, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Britain welcomed Napoleon And Eugenie of France to a full state visit to England. Eugenie was considered a fashion icon in France. She and Queen Victoria became instant friends. Queen Victoria, who had been the fashion icon for European high fashion, was inspired by Eugenie's style and the fashions she wore. Later Queen Victoria also appointed Charles Frederick Worth as her dress maker and he became a prominent designer amongst the European upper class. Charles Frederick Worth is known as the father of the haute couture as later the concept of labels were also invented in the late 19th century as custom, made to fit tailoring became mainstream.\n\nBy the 1860s, when Europe was all about made-to-fit tailoring, crinolines were considered impractical. In the 1870s, women preferred more slimmer silhouettes, hence bodices grew longer and the polonaise, a skirt and bodice made together, was introduced. In 1870s the Cuirass Bodice, a piece of armour that covers the torso and functions like a corset, was invented. Towards the end of Victoria's reign, dresses were flared naturally as crinolines were rejected by middle class women. Designers such as Charles Frederick Worth were also against them. All these inventions and changes in fashion led to women's liberation as tailored looks improved posture and were more practical.\n\nHome decor started spare, veered into the elaborately draped and decorated style we today regard as Victorian, then embraced the retro-chic of William Morris as well as pseudo-Japonaiserie.\n\nMany myths and exaggerations about the period persist to the modern day. Examples include the idea of men's clothing is seen as formal and stiff, women's as elaborate and over-done; clothing covered the entire body, and even the glimpse of an ankle was scandalous. Critics contend that corsets constricted women's bodies and women's lives. Homes are described as gloomy, dark, cluttered with massive and over-ornate furniture and proliferating bric-a-brac. Myth has it that even piano legs were scandalous, and covered with tiny pantalettes.\n\nIn truth, men's formal clothing may have been less colourful than it was in the previous century, but brilliant waistcoats and cummerbunds provided a touch of color, and smoking jackets and dressing gowns were often of rich Oriental brocades. This phenomenon was the result of the growing textile manufacturing sector, developing mass production processes, and increasing attempts to market fashion to men. Corsets stressed a woman's sexuality, exaggerating hips and bust by contrast with a tiny waist. Women's evening gowns bared the shoulders and the tops of the breasts. The jersey dresses of the 1880s may have covered the body, but the stretchy novel fabric fit the body like a glove.\n\nHome furnishing was not necessarily ornate or overstuffed. However, those who could afford lavish draperies and expensive ornaments, and wanted to display their wealth, would often do so. Since the Victorian era was one of increased social mobility, there were ever more \"nouveaux riches\" making a rich show.\n\nThe items used in decoration may also have been darker and heavier than those used today, simply as a matter of practicality. London was noisy and its air was full of soot from countless coal fires. Hence those who could afford it draped their windows in heavy, sound-muffling curtains, and chose colours that didn't show soot quickly. When all washing was done by hand, curtains were not washed as frequently as they might be today.\n\nThere is no actual evidence that piano legs were considered scandalous. Pianos and tables were often draped with shawls or cloths—but if the shawls hid anything, it was the cheapness of the furniture. There are references to lower-middle-class families covering up their pine tables rather than show that they couldn't afford mahogany. The piano leg story seems to have originated in the 1839 book, \"A Diary in America\" written by Captain Frederick Marryat, as a satirical comment on American prissiness.\n\nVictorian manners may have been as strict as imagined—on the surface. One simply did not speak publicly about sex, childbirth, and such matters, at least in the respectable middle and upper classes. However, as is well known, discretion covered a multitude of sins. Prostitution flourished. Upper-class men and women indulged in adulterous liaisons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
