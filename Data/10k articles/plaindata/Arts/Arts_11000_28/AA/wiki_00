It is the location of the annual \"Festival Amazonas de Ópera\" (Amazonas Opera Festival) and the home of the Amazonas Philharmonic Orchestra which regularly rehearses and performs at the Amazon Theater along with choirs, musical concerts and other performances.\n\nThe Amazonas Theatre was built during the Belle Époque at a time when fortunes were made in the rubber boom. Construction of the Amazon Theatre was first proposed in 1881 by a member of the local House of Representatives, Antonio Jose Fernandes Júnior, who envisioned a \"jewel\" in the heart of the Amazon rainforest.\n\nIn 1882, the State legislature approved some limited financing, but this was considered insufficient. Later that year, the president of the Province, José Lustosa Paranaguá, approved a larger budget and initiated a competition for the presentation of plans. The chosen project was made by the \"Gabinete Português de Engenharia e Arquitectura\", an engineering and architecture office from Lisbon. By 1884, construction was ready to begin under the Italian architect Celestial Sacardim. Work proceeded slowly over the following fifteen years with some stops and restarts from 1885 to 1892.\n\nBy 1895, when the masonry work and exterior were completed, the decoration of the interior and the installation of electric lighting could begin more rapidly. The theatre was inaugurated on December 31, 1896, with the first performance occurring on January 7, 1897, with the Italian opera, \"La Gioconda\", by Amilcare Ponchielli.\n\nThe theatre's architectural style is considered typically Renaissance Revival. The roofing tiles were imported from Alsace, the steel walls from Glasgow, Scotland and the Carrara marble for the stairs, statues and columns, from Italy. The dome is covered with 36,000 decorated ceramic tiles painted in the colors of the national flag of Brazil. The interior furnishing came from France in the Louis Quinze style. Italian artist Domenico de Angelis the Younger painted the panels that decorate the ceilings of the auditorium and of the audience chamber. The curtain, with its painting \"Meeting of the Waters\", was originally created in Paris by Crispim do Amaral. The theatre's 198 chandeliers were imported from Italy, including 32 of Murano glass.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6901384", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6901384", "title": "Artist's statement", "text": "Artist's statement\n\nAn artist's statement (or artist statement) is an artist's written description of their work. The brief verbal representation is for, and in support of, his or her own work to give the viewer understanding. As such it aims to inform, connect with an art context, and present the basis for the work; it is, therefore, didactic, descriptive, or reflective in nature.\n\nThe artist's text intends to explain, justify, extend, and/or contextualize his or her body of work. It places or attempts to place the work in relationship to art history and theory, the art world and the times. Further, the statement serves to show that the artist is conscious of their intentions, aware of their practice and its position within art parameters and of the discourse surrounding it. Therefore not only does it describe and place, but it indicates the level of the artist's own comprehension of their field and making. The artist statement serves as a \"vital link of communication between you [the artist], and the rest of the world.\" Most people encounter a work of art through a reproduction first, and there are many elements that are not present within a reproduction. That is why it is imperative that the artist knows how to properly convey their work through their own words. What the artist writes in their statement may be integrated in wall text, hand outs at an exhibition or a paragraph in a press release. Judgments will be made based both on the nature of the art, as well as the words that accompany it. \nArtists often write a short (50-100 word) and/or a long (500-1000 word) version of the same statement, and they may maintain and revise these statements throughout their careers. They may be edited to suit the requirements of specific funding bodies, galleries or call-outs as part of the application process.\n\nThe writing of artists' statements is a comparatively recent phenomenon beginning in the 1990s. In some respects, the practice resembles the art manifesto and may derive in part from it. However, the artist's statement generally speaks for an individual rather than a collective, and is not strongly associated with polemic. Rather, a contemporary artist may be required to submit the statement in order to tender for commissions or apply for schools, residencies, jobs, awards, and other forms of institutional support, in justification of their submission.\n\nIn their 2008 survey of North American art schools and university art programs, Garrett-Petts and Nash found that nearly 90% teach the writing of artist statements as part of the curriculum; in addition, they found that, \n\nLike prefaces, forewords, prologues, and introductions to literary works, the artist statement performs a vital if complex rhetorical role: when included in an exhibition proposal and sent to a curator, the artist statement usually provides a description of the work, some indication of the work's art historical and theoretical context, some background information about the artist and the artist's intentions, technical specifications – and, at the same time, it aims to persuade the reader of the artwork's value. When hung on a gallery wall, the statement (or \"didactic\") becomes an invitation, an explanation, and, often indirectly, an element of the installation itself.\n\nOn at least two occasions, artist's statements have been the subject of gallery exhibitions. The first exhibition of artists' statements, \"The Art of the Artist's Statement\", was curated by Georgia Kotretsos and Maria Pashalidou at the Hellenic Museum, Chicago, in the spring of 2005. It featured the work of 14 artists invited to create artwork offering a visual commentary on the subject of artist statements. The second exhibition, \"Proximities: Artists' Statements and Their Works\", was installed in the fall of 2005 at the Kamloops Art Gallery, Kamloops, British Columbia. Co-curated by W.F. Garrett-Petts and Rachel Nash, the exhibition asked nine contributing artists to respond to the topic of artists’ statements by taking one or more of their own artist’s statements and working with the text(s) in a manner that documented, represented, and annotated the original work, creating a new work in the process.\n\nArtist's statements have been the subject of a research project on the professional language of the contemporary art world by sociologist Alix Rule and artist David Levine. Presented in their 2012 article \"International Art English,\" published in the American art journal Triple Canopy, Levine & Rule collated and analysed thousands of gallery press releases, published by e-flux since 1999, in an attempt to dissect and understand the peculiar language of the professional art world. It has since become one of the most widely circulated pieces of online cultural criticism.\n\n"}

It stars Madeleine Stowe, Mary Stuart Masterson, Andie MacDowell and Drew Barrymore.\n\nThe film follows four former prostitutes on the run following a justifiable homicide and prison escape, who later encounter difficulties involving bank robbery and Pinkerton detectives.\n\nKaplan previously directed two of the film's stars: Masterson in \"Immediate Family\" (1989) and Stowe in \"Unlawful Entry\" (1992).\n\nCody, Anita, Eileen and Lily work together in a brothel. When Anita is abused by a customer, Cody kills the man.\n\nNarrowly escaping from a lynch mob, they are pursued by Pinkerton detectives hired by the widow of the man they'd shot. A man they meet on the road, McCoy, warns them of the pursuit. \n\nThey discuss riding to Oregon and starting a new life by taking up a claim to land inherited by Anita when her husband died of cholera. Cody offers to fund their new start from savings she has accumulated over the years. They go to the bank where Cody's savings are held. As she tries to close her account and make a withdrawal, the Pinkerton detectives catch up with her and try to arrest her. Leaving the bank manager's office, they find themselves in the middle of a bank robbery being staged by Kid Jarrett, a former lover of Cody. He helps her escape from arrest but takes her money and tells her to find him.\n\nDuring the escape, Eileen is arrested. Cody decides to go after the money and Kid Jarrett, telling Anita and Lilly to wait in hiding. Anita and Lilly return to town to break Eileen out of jail. \n\nCody's meeting with Kid Jarrett and Frank Jarrett does not go well. Kid Jarrett has not forgiven her for running out on him. He flogs her. Later, she is found unconscious by McCoy, who brings her to a healer in town and puts the Pinkerton detectives off her trail.\n\nMcCoy, Cody and the other three women meet up on the ranch of a farmer who'd been guarding Eileen's cell (and whom they'd tricked into releasing her). Cody plans revenge on Kid Jarrett. They foil a train robbery and steal his loot, at the cost of Lilly being abducted. In turn, they abduct Frank Jarrett, Kid's father.\n\nRegrouping again on the ranch, Anita leaves the others, frustrated with their revenge-motivated misadventures. She goes to a lawyer in town and finds out that the claim to land is only valid in the hands of her husband - as a woman, she cannot claim the land in Oregon.\n\nFrank Jarrett antagonizes his captors until McCoy shoots him. Cody sends away McCoy. Meanwhile, Lilly is being raped by her captors. McCoy stages a one-man rescue attempt and is captured, but Lilly escapes.\n\nReunited, Cody, Anita and Eileen go to rescue Lilly and meet her on the road. When she tells them that McCoy has been captured, they continue towards Kid Jarrett's hide out, and offer to trade the stolen loot for McCoy, who has been flogged and tortured. Kid agrees, then shoots McCoy as soon as the loot is handed over. He gives Cody the money he stole from her (although in close up it clearly is mid-20th century currency).\n\nWhile retreating, one of Lilly's would-be rapists taunts her, triggering a shootout that results in the deaths of Kid's entire gang.\n\nAfter the shootout, Eileen marries the rancher, while Lilly, Cody and Anita head west to start a new life, mentioning the Klondike Gold Rush of 1896. On the trail they overtake the Pinkerton detectives, who do not see them.\n\n\nThe film was written by Jerry Goldsmith, who composed the music as a cross between the style of his 1960s westerns and a contemporary sound. The soundtrack has been released twice; through Fox Records on 10 May 1994 and an extended, limited edition through La-La Land Records on 28 June 2011.\n\nTrack list for the La-La Land edition (tracks in italics also on the Fox release, asterisked tracks include previously unreleased material):\n\n\"Bad Girls\" received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics upon its release and currently holds a 9% \"Rotten\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 3.5 out of 10.\n\nOn April 22, 1994, Roger Ebert wrote for \"Chicago Sun-Times\": \"What a good idea, to make a Western about four tough women. And what a sad movie.\" Janet Maslin, in her \"New York Times\" review on the same day, ridiculed the film as \"Cowpoke Barbie\".\n\nThe film was released on VHS and on DVD, which contains an uncut extended version.\n\n"}
{"id": "1716827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1716827", "title": "Bagism", "text": "Bagism\n\nBagism is a satire of prejudice, where by living in a bag a person could not be judged on their bodily appearance. Bagism was created by John Lennon and Yoko Ono as part of their extensive peace campaign in the late 1960s. The intent of bagism was to satirize prejudice and stereotyping. Bagism involved literally wearing a bag over one's entire body. According to John and Yoko, by living in a bag, a person could not be judged by others on the basis of skin colour, gender, hair length, attire, age, or any other such attributes. It was presented as a form of total communication: instead of focusing on outward appearance, the listener would hear only the bagist's message.\n\nJohn and Yoko introduced the idea during a well-received press conference in Vienna on 31 March 1969, and explained it more thoroughly in a 14 June 1969 interview with David Frost. Bagism reflected the whimsical, carefree, and often comedic mood of John and Yoko's other peace efforts, such as their Bed-Ins. By catching the attention of the masses with its outlandish premise, bagism presented a powerful social and political message to the world. As Lennon stated, \"Yoko and I are quite willing to be the world's clowns; if by doing it we do some good.\"\n\nYoko said that bagism was inspired by the theme of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's \"The Little Prince\", which was \"One sees rightly only with the heart, the essential is invisible to the eyes.\" She hoped that the bag (by hiding her and John's physical appearance) would make their essence, or the essence of their message, visible.\n\nThe couple had earlier appeared in a bag, at The Alchemical Wedding, an underground artists' gathering, at London's Royal Albert Hall in late 1968. The event was put on by the Arts Lab and BIT (infoshop), which sought to challenge audiences to be participants rather than passive consumers. John and Yoko climbed into a large white bag on stage, sat cross-legged, knee-to-knee, hunkered down and closed the bag. They moved only twice in 45 minutes, hunkering further down. This was a strong challenge to the audience.\n\n\"Musicians played, poets ranted, and John and Yoko crept into their white sheet-like bag on the stage and stayed there out of sight for what seemed like ages. I watched a baby crawl slowly by. And that was the bag happening. All mayhem broke out when a young female member of the audience stripped off her clothes and danced in naked delight. When the police were called and attendants tried to remove her, groups of people started stripping off their clothes in solidarity. There was a retreat and a truce was worked out, and no-one was arrested. The nude girl incident, with accompanying photo, made the front pages of the London evening papers.\" As Lee Harris noted later.\n\nBagism is mentioned three times in the songs of John Lennon. The first time is in \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\" where John refers to \"eating chocolate cake in a bag\", which was at the Vienna press conference, and the second is in the song \"Come Together\", where he sings: \"He bag production\". This is a reference to Bag Productions Ltd, Lennon's public relations company, which derived its name from Bagism. The third reference is in \"Give Peace a Chance\", with the line, \"Everybody's talkin' about Bagism, Shagism, dragism, Madism, Ragism, Tagism, This-ism, That-ism, ism, ism, ism.\"\n\nA website called Bagism was created c. 1994 by Sam Choukri, providing John Lennon and Beatles links, photographs, rare sound recording snippets and video. At one point, c. 1996, the precursor to Bagism.com, a website focused on Lennon, was sent a cease and desist request from the representatives of his estate over copyrighted John Lennon content. After an unsuccessful appeal to Ono and the John Lennon Estate and the Dear Yoko petition campaign, Choukri decided to focus his efforts on less legally volatile content and the website has since been a hub for discussion, detailed discographies, letters, articles, fan artwork and poetry, and many other types of content.\n\nIn 2006, Liverpool John Lennon Airport had the words \"Bagism, Shagism, Dragism, Madism, Ragism, Tagism\" stickered along the front windows of the airport. This was done along with the branding of various John Lennon lyrics around the inside of the airport.\n\nIn 2010, the studio band Strawberry Walrus recorded a song entitled \"Bagism\" and released it on their album \"This Is Not Here\".\n\n\n"}

The book is based upon a series of articles written by the authors for \"The Wall Street Journal\". The book was later made into a made-for-TV movie by HBO, also called \"Barbarians at the Gate\". The book centers on F. Ross Johnson, the CEO of RJR Nabisco, who planned to buy out the rest of the Nabisco shareholders.\n\nThose opposed to Johnson's bid for the company, Henry Kravis and his cousin George R. Roberts, were among the pioneers of the leveraged buyout (LBO). Kravis was the first person Johnson talked to about doing the LBO and feels betrayed after learning that Johnson wants to do the deal with another firm, American Express's former Shearson Lehman Hutton division. Ted Forstmann and his Forstmann Little buyout firm also played a prominent role.\n\nAfter Kravis and Johnson are unable to reconcile their differences, a bidding war takes place which Johnson will eventually lose. The unfortunate side effect of the augmented buyout price to the shareholders is the creation of a worrying level of debt for the company.\n\nThe title of the book comes from a statement by Forstmann, in which he calls Kravis' money \"phoney junk bond crap\" and declares him and his cousin as \"real people with real money,\" also stating that to stop raiders like Kravis: \"We need to push the barbarians back from the city gates.\"\n\n\nThe book was adapted by Larry Gelbart for a 1993 television movie of the same name directed by Glenn Jordan.\n\nIn 2008, Harper Collins re-released \"Barbarians\" to mark the two-decade anniversary of the RJR deal. Media columnist Jon Friedman at MarketWatch opined on the occasion that it was \"the best business book ever.\" Friedman spoke with the authors about the two-decade history of the book and of their ensuing careers (the two undertook no further joint projects). Business reporter Andrew Ross Sorkin of \"The New York Times\" wrote in his book \"Too Big to Fail\" that this is his favourite business book of all time.\n\n"}

Opened September 17, 1994 as Bergamot Station the campus-like complex is owned by the city of Santa Monica and presently managed by the Worthe Group.\n\nFormerly \"Bergamot Station\" the site was previously a stop and car storage area from 1875 to 1953, first serving the steam-powered Los Angeles and Independence Railroad and later the Santa Monica Air Line. The station was named after Wild Bergamot (Monarda fistulosa), a wild flower native to North America, that once flourished in the area.\n\nAfter passenger service ceased, the line was used for light freight delivery only. Car storage was no longer needed and Southern Pacific Railroad leased the land to various companies for light manufacturing. Warehouse buildings were constructed and housed a celery packing operation, then an ice-making plant, and finally, the manufacturing home base for American Appliance water heaters.\n\nAs the rail line fell into disuse and eventual abandonment in the late 1980s, the City of Santa Monica purchased the entire parcel from Southern Pacific Railroad in 1987 to prevent it from being split up and sold. At that time a future light rail service along the right of way was anticipated within 10 years, and the site would be needed as a service yard and passenger station.\n\nAmerican Appliance moved out in 1993, leaving a sprawling industrial complex sitting vacant. Even under the most optimistic scenarios, plans for the light rail were years away. The City, seeking a productive use for the site, approached Wayne Blank, developer and co-owner of the Shoshana Wayne Gallery. Blank's development expertise had already been tapped by the City of Santa Monica for an earlier project: the conversion of a vacant city-owned airport hangar into artists' studios.\n\nPleased with the airport project's outcome, The City asked Blank to conceive of an artistic use for the site. Blank along with acclaimed architect Lawrence Scarpa of the architecture firm Brooks + Scarpa, created a campus-like complex that retained its industrial and rudimentary look. \"Blank's search for a limited partner began and ended with Tom Patchett, an art collector and TV writer who was looking for space to store and possibly exhibit his separate collections of contemporary art and Americana\"\n\nThe complex has become so popular that the original rail intention has been usurped. When, in 2010, Phase 2 of the Metro Expo Line was approved, adjacent land was purchased to serve the purpose. 26th Street/Bergamot, a stop on the new Expo Line light rail between Los Angeles and Santa Monica, located just North of the entrance of the new arts destination, was opened to the public on May 20, 2016.\n\nAs of January 1, 2018 the property was officially re-renamed 26th Street Art Center and is managed by the Worthe Group who now refer to the facility in all marketing material as \"Bergamot.\"\n\n"}

By offering low-cost design studio space, business mentoring, educational seminars, and networking opportunities, the program provides a way for participants to reach their full potential and become an integral part of the New York Fashion community. In 2010, the program partnered with New York University’s Stern School of Business to create a Masters Workshop that pairs their top MBA Students with the designers to work on business development projects.\n\nSuccessful alumni of the Incubator program include Prabal Gurung and the 2013 CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund winners, Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne of Public School.\n\nThe 4.0 class (2016-2018) of the {FASHION INCUBATOR} includes Alexandra Alvarez of Alix, Aurora James of Brother Vellies, Charles Youssef, Daniel DuGoff of Ddugoff, Tim Joo and Dan Joo of Haerfest, Jason Alkire and Julie Alkire of Haus Alkire, Ji Oh, Katie deGuzman and Michael Miller of K/ller Collection, Thaddeus O’Neil, and Molly Yestadt of Yestadt Millinery. \n\nThe Fashion Manufacturing Initiative (FMI) is an investment fund to help revitalize New York City’s garment industry. The program offers matching financial grants to New York City’s fashion manufacturing production facilities.\n\nIn March 2018, the CFDA and NYCA announced that the following seven production facilities would receive a combined total of $480,000 in the fifth round of FMI grants: Atelier Amelia, Sunrise Studio, In Style USA, Mudo Fashion, New York Embroidery Studio, Season Wash, and Werkstatt.\n\nFashion Targets Breast Cancer® (FTBC), a charitable initiative of the CFDA/CFDA Foundation, seeks to raise public awareness and funds for the breast cancer cause.\n\nThe Fashion Targets Breast Cancer name and symbol were created by Ralph Lauren and subsequently entrusted to the CFDA Foundation. FTBC was first presented in the U.S. in the spring of 1994 during New York Fashion Week, and was formally launched in September 1994 at a special White House reception hosted by then-First Lady Hillary Clinton. During this initial campaign, 400,000 FTBC shirts were sold, raising $2 million to benefit the Nina Hyde Center for Breast Health at the Lombardi Cancer Center at Georgetown University Medical Center. This center was chosen as beneficiary at Ralph Lauren’s request, in memory of his friend Nina Hyde, the former fashion editor of \"The Washington Post\", who died of breast cancer in 1990.\n\nSince 2011, the Council has led an annual campaign to promote the initiative and partners with well known fashion icons. In 2017, Fabletics partnered with Fashion Targets Breast Cancer to produce an activewear collection. A portion of all sales for the collection would be donated to target breast cancer screening and treatment.\n\nTo date, nearly $50 million has been granted to breast cancer charities worldwide from FTBC campaigns. CFDA Members have designed special FTBC branded or inspired merchandise, which was either sold or auctioned over the course of the campaign.\n\nThe Scholarship Program was created to award annual merit-based scholarship grants to students who study in a four-year, full-time college level design program. It has awarded $1,399,250 to students. The Geoffrey Beene Design Scholarship Award, the Liz Claiborne Design Scholarship Award, and the CFDA/Teen Vogue Scholarship Award in partnership with Target selected scholars from one of the CFDA’s 20 participating design schools and donated $25,000 towards tuition and educational expenses. The awards are based solely on merit and judged by a panel of industry experts.\n\nThe CFDA has published nine books:\n\n\n\n"}

Death masks may be mementos of the dead, or be used for creation of portraits. Such casts obviate idealised representations by revealing the actual features. It is sometimes possible to identify portraits that have been painted from death masks, because of the characteristic slight distortions of the features caused by the weight of the plaster during the making of the mold.\n\nThe main purpose of the death mask from the Middle Ages until the 19th century was to serve as a model for sculptors in creating statues and busts of the deceased person. Not until the 1800s did such masks become valued for themselves.\n\nIn other cultures a death mask may be a funeral mask, an image placed on the face of the deceased before burial rites, and normally buried with them. The best known of these are the masks used in ancient Egypt as part of the mummification process, such as Tutankhamun's mask, and those from Mycenaean Greece such as the Mask of Agamemnon.\n\nIn some European countries, it was common for death masks to be used as part of the effigy of the deceased, displayed at state funerals; the coffin portrait was an alternative. Mourning portraits were also painted, showing the subject lying in repose. During the 18th and 19th centuries masks were also used to permanently record the features of unknown corpses for purposes of identification. This function was later replaced by post-mortem photography.\n\nIn the cases of people whose faces were damaged by their death, it was common to take casts of their hands. An example of this occurred in the case of Thomas D'Arcy McGee, the Canadian statesman whose face was shattered by the bullet which assassinated him in 1868.\nWhen taken from a living subject, such a cast is called a life mask. Proponents of phrenology used both death masks and life masks for pseudoscientific purposes.\n\nMasks of deceased persons are part of traditions in many countries. The most important process of the funeral ceremony in ancient Egypt was the mummification of the body, which, after prayers and consecration, was put into a sarcophagus enameled and decorated with gold and gems. A special element of the rite was a sculpted mask, put on the face of the deceased. This mask was believed to strengthen the spirit of the mummy and guard the soul from evil spirits on its way to the afterworld. The best known mask is Tutankhamun's mask. Made of gold and gems, the mask conveys the highly stylized features of the ancient ruler. Such masks were not, however, made from casts of the features; rather, the mummification process itself preserved the features of the deceased.\n\nIn 1876 the archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann discovered in Mycenae six graves, which he was confident belonged to kings and ancient Greek heroes—Agamemnon, Cassandra, Evrimdon and their associates. To his surprise, the skulls were covered with gold masks. It is now thought most unlikely that the masks actually belonged to Agamemnon and other heroes of the Homeric epics; in fact they are several centuries older.\n\nThe lifelike character of Roman portrait sculptures has been attributed to the earlier Roman use of wax to preserve the features of deceased family members (the so-called \"imagines maiorum\"). The wax masks were subsequently reproduced in more durable stone.\n\nThe use of masks in the ancestor cult is also attested in Etruria. Excavations of tombs in the area of the ancient city of Clusium (modern Chiusi, Tuscany) have yielded a number of sheet bronze masks dating from the Etruscan Late Orientalising period. In the 19th century it was thought that they were related to the Mycenaean examples, but whether they served as actual death masks cannot be proven. The most credited hypothesis holds that they were originally fixed to cinerary urns, to give them a human appearance. In Orientalising Clusium, the anthropomorphization of urns was a prevalent phenomenon that was strongly rooted in local religious beliefs.\n\nIn the late Middle Ages, a shift took place from sculpted masks to true death masks, made of wax or plaster. These masks were not interred with the deceased. Instead, they were used in funeral ceremonies and were later kept in libraries, museums, and universities. Death masks were taken not only of deceased royalty and nobility (Henry VIII, Sforza), but also of eminent persons—composers, dramaturges, military and political leaders, philosophers, poets, and scientists, such as Dante Alighieri, Ludwig van Beethoven, Napoleon Bonaparte (whose death mask was taken on the island of Saint Helena), Filippo Brunelleschi, Frédéric Chopin, Oliver Cromwell (whose death mask is preserved at Warwick Castle), Joseph Haydn, John Keats, Franz Liszt, Blaise Pascal, Nikola Tesla (commissioned by his friend Hugo Gernsback and now displayed in the Nikola Tesla Museum), Torquato Tasso, and Voltaire. As in ancient Rome, death masks were often subsequently used in making marble sculpture portraits, busts, or engravings of the deceased.\n\nIn Russia, the death mask tradition dates back to the times of Peter the Great, whose death mask was taken by Carlo Bartolomeo Rastrelli. Also well known are the death masks of Nicholas I, and Alexander I. Stalin's death mask is on display at the Stalin Museum in Gori, Georgia.\n\nOne of the first real Ukrainian death masks was that of the poet Taras Shevchenko, taken by Peter Clodt von Jürgensburg in St. Petersburg, Russia.\n\nIn early spring of 1860 and shortly before his death in April 1865, two life masks were created of President Abraham Lincoln.\n\nDeath masks were increasingly used by scientists from the late 18th century onwards to record variations in human physiognomy. The life mask was also increasingly common at this time, taken from living persons. Anthropologists used such masks to study physiognomic features in famous people and notorious criminals. Masks were also used to collect data on racial differences.\n\nBefore the widespread availability of photography, the facial features of unidentified bodies were sometimes preserved by creating death masks so that relatives of the deceased could recognize them if they were seeking a missing person.\n\nOne mask, known as L'Inconnue de la Seine, recorded the face of an unidentified young woman who, around the age of sixteen, according to one man's story, had been found drowned in the Seine River at Paris, France around the late 1880s. A morgue worker made a cast of her face, saying \"Her beauty was breathtaking, and showed few signs of distress at the time of passing. So bewitching that I knew beauty as such must be preserved.\" The cast was also compared to Mona Lisa, and other famous paintings and sculptures. In the following years, copies of the mask became a fashionable fixture in Parisian Bohemian society.\n\nThe face of Resusci Anne, the world's first CPR training mannequin, introduced in 1960, was modeled after \"L'Inconnue de la Seine\".\n\n\n"}

Mary and John, and any other figures, are shown facing towards Christ with their hands raised in supplication on behalf of humanity. \n\nIn early examples, it was often placed on the templon beam in Orthodox churches or above doors, though it also appears on icons and devotional ivories.\n\nAfter the development of the full iconostasis screen there was room for a larger \"Deesis row\" or \"Great Deesis\" of full-length figures, and the number of figures expanded, in both Byzantium and Russia. Usually this row is above the level of the doors, and below the row depicting the Twelve Great Feasts, sometimes the Deesis is above the Feasts. The central Christ is therefore above the main door in the screen. Soon seven figures, usually one to a panel, were standard, in order of proximity to Christ in the centre: on the left (Christ's right) Mary, the Archangel Michael and Saint Peter, and on the right John the Baptist, the Archangel Gabriel and Saint Paul. Especially in Russian examples, a number of saints of local significance are often included behind these, as space allows. Andrey Rublev's row for the Cathedral of the Dormition in Vladimir were 3.14 metres (over ten feet) high. In the Greek tradition the Apostles are more likely to occupy extra panels.\n\nThe presence of Mary and John, and other figures, is one of the differences with the Western \"Christ in Majesty\", where the Four Evangelists and/or their symbols are more commonly included around Christ. The Deesis composition is also commonly found in the West, especially those parts of Italy under Byzantine influence, but also the rest of Europe. It often forms part of a scene of the Last Judgement. The use of the image declined slowly throughout the Middle Ages, and it is never as common as the Western forms of Christ in Majesty.\n\nIn depictions of the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ on the cross is also very often flanked by the Virgin standing on one side, but Saint John the Evangelist on the other, not John the Baptist. \n\n"}

His thesis \"Der Meister von Flemalle und Rogier van der Weyden\", written in 1912, was published in 1913.\n\nHe then started working as the editor of the \"Lexikon der bildenden Künstler\" by Ulrich Thieme and Felix Becker, for which he wrote 34 entries. He also worked as a volunteer at the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden, but then joined the army during World War I. He left the army in 1915 to become the director of the Kunstbibliothek Berlin. he wrote a work on Early Netherlandish miniatures, and in 1924 reworked \"Die Altniederländisch Malerei von 1400-1600\", originally written by Max Jacob Friedländer.

The castle was built during the Sassanid Empire (224 to 651 AD) and functioned as fortified walled city on the ancient Silk Road that ran through central Iran. Izadkhast was the first castle in the world made from adobe. And it is the second largest adobe building in the world after Arg-e Bam. \n\nThe castle is built on a high bedrock overlooking the Izadkhast valley. Inside the castle walls are many narrow alleyways and passages criss-crossing through centuries old tiny houses and buildings.\n\nThe castle and surrounding Izadkhast complex has been nominated to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on August 9, 2007 in the Cultural category.\n\nThe Izad-khast castle is located on the ancient Silk Road between Shiraz and Isfahan. The site is in the middle of nowhere and surrounded by a desert land. But a high singular bedrock overlooking a valley was an ideal location for the development of a fortified desert city in the middle of nowhere. \n\nThe Izadkhvast castle is built on this singular bedrock that juts out to the Izadkhast valley. The valley around it functions as a natural deep trench. Castle fortification walls have been built around the bedrock, tall and almost perpendicular, ranging from 6 to 15 meters on three sides. On the fourth and shorter side of the bedrock, a 30 meter (100 feet) long trench had been dug. The trench is 4 meters across and 4 meters deep. Access to the castle was over the trench, through a small bridge and a gate. \n\nThe site's natural topography and added fortifications made the castle one of the most unattainable buildings of the ancient times for robbers and enemies. \n\nOn the valley below the castle bedrock are rocky fields, with a barren plateau behind. The Izadkhast caravanserai roadside inn stands alone in this valley, in the middle of a rocky field. \n\nThe history of the castle complex dates back to the pre-Islamic era of Iran. Izad-Khast is a Sassanid castle, built during the Sassanid Empire (224 to 651 AD) which ruled Persia (Iran) and many parts of the surrounding countries. It was then used, added and improved on until Qajars era (1794 to 1925). This has left works inside the castle belonging to different periods from Sassanids to Qajars with different architectural styles.\n\nThe fire temple of Izad Khast Castle from the Sassanid era was turned into a mosque after the advent of Islam to Iran.\n\nThe castle and complex is now completely abandon. However until the turn of the millennium there were still people living in the old quarters of Izadkhast. Floods in recent years destroyed many homes and forced people to move from this isolated, ancient desert citadel. \n\nIn location and form of construction the castle display unique characteristics. However the material wise its comparable to the Citadel of Bam, Rayen and other sites nearby in Yazd and Kerman provinces. The architecture of Izadkhast castle is very similar to the more feted Citadel of Bam. The Izad-Khast castle like the Citadel of Bam is a sand construction, made of adobe. \n\nThe castle is a Sassanid (224 to 651 AD) structure, but the interior has seen modifications and new structures added later on. Structures like a mosque and a bathroom are later additions.\n\nMost of the homes in the castle interior are built from wood and mud. Size limitations of the bedrock led to an agglomeration of smaller rooms and increase of floors. Some of the buildings inside the castle rose as high as five storeys. It is impressive in itself but becomes a remarkable architectural achievement considering the circumstances of its time.\n\nThe Izadkhast Caravanserai was built during the Safavid Dynasty era (1502 - 1736).\n\nMany parts of the Izadkhast castle are crumbling due to erosion and flooding. Many homes even beside the castle front gate have been completely destroyed. \n\nThe castle is also in danger from treasure hunters and vandalism. Inside the walled city, there are signs of damage from treasure hunters and graffiti on the walls.\n\n"}

She is also an unofficial foster mother to the entire group.\n\nKitty is Eric and Laurie Forman's mother and the wife of Red Forman: a cheerful, sunny, sweet-natured typical housewife with a much happier, gentler personality as opposed to that displayed by her ill-tempered, wisecracking husband, Red. She almost always treats those around her sweetly and kindly and shows far more respect for the teenagers than Red does. She cooks a great deal and often uses food to encourage and cheer people up.\n\nShe has occasionally been provoked into using profanity strong enough to be censored out, albeit otherwise she seldom raises her voice to other people. She smoked frequently for a period of time before deciding to quit the habit, although when stressed she has been shown to relapse, even taking a cigarette from one of the teenagers when desperate, due to an unexpected visit from her mother-in-law, who treats her shabbily.\n\nKitty's parents generally generate stress for both Kitty and Red, particularly her rather cold, unaffectionate, hypercritical mother, Bea (played by Betty White). Kitty's genial but rather hapless father, Burt (played by Tom Poston), evokes more affection. Burt makes a terrible financial investment in an ostrich farm (located next to a coyote farm) which costs the Sigurdsons their home, leaving them dependent on the Formans. He collapses outside the house and dies soon afterward, the only occasion on which Bea shows emotion, albeit privately until Kitty finds her.\n\nUnlike Red, Kitty enjoys having young people around her house. In regards to her children, she clearly favors Eric. She sees Laurie's true colors (unlike Red, who favors Laurie and browbeats Eric) and once said she loves her daughter \"because I have to\". She sometimes tries to get through to Laurie, almost always without success.\n\nUpon learning Eric has lost his virginity (episode \"The Parents Find Out\") she stays in bed, depressed and angry at Donna, only leaving bed when Eric reminds her that he needs Kitty to protect him from Red. For a time, she is sad that her children are growing up and expresses a desire for another baby, episode \"Baby Fever\", a feeling her husband does not share.\n\nKitty resolves her sadness over not being able to have another child when Red reminded her of grandchildren. When Eric and Donna announce that they are moving to Madison at the end of season five, Kitty suffers a nervous breakdown, exacerbated by Red's support of the plan. Later, when Eric plans to go to Africa in season seven, Kitty tries to sabotage his efforts by withholding food and information on immunizations. After he leaves at the start of season eight, Kitty briefly tries marijuana.\nKitty is fond of Hyde, whom they take in after his mother abandons him, leaving him nowhere to go. In the episode \"Kitty's Birthday (Is That Today!?)\", Hyde is the only one who remembers her birthday, and in the episode \"Jackie Bags Hyde\", Kitty is the one who helps Hyde realize he likes Jackie. Kitty treats Hyde as a second son even after he moves out of the Forman basement. In the series finale, she referred to him as \"my second son\". \nKitty treats Eric's other friends Kelso, Fez and Jackie as her own children as well; she looks out for them and helps them out on numerous occasions throughout the series. For example, she taught the prenatal class Kelso and Brooke take before Betsy's birth, she attempts to teach Jackie how to bake on two occasions, and she behaves as a mother to Fez, who hasn't seen his real parents since emigrating to the United States.\n\nBeing a nurse and a maternal figure, she is the one who treats the teenagers whenever they get physically injured (which happens quite often), especially Kelso. Kitty plays an active role in all the group's private lives; for example, she is the one who orchestrated the talk between Jackie and her mother Pam (played by Brooke Shields) in season six. Kitty seems to dislike anyone who questions her values, telling Jackie to \"shut your dirty little mouth\" when she references Kitty's frequent drinking; and when Kelso asks if she'd ever smoked, she stared at him and Red makes him leave.\n\nDespite being a motherly figure to all of the teens, Kelso and Fez seem to have some sexual attraction towards her. Fez admits this to Charlie Richardson after he sees Kitty naked accidentally, asking what she looked like and saying, \"And I'm only asking this because I find Miss Kitty attractive in a sexual way.\" Also, after Kelso has a break up with Hyde's sister, Angie, he tells Eric, \"I need a hug from your mom.\" Eric concludes his conversation with Hyde, leaving to \"go pull Kelso off my mother\". Also, Hyde, before his (technically not legal) adoption made him Kitty's son, demonstrated some attraction to Kitty, such as when she was teaching him dancing, he greatly enjoyed placing his hand in the small of her back, almost sexually. As part of the plot of that episode, Bob sees them and assumes they are having an affair.\n\nIn season eight, with Eric gone, she seemingly replaces him with Fez. Fez begins dating a friend of hers and when she finds out, she snaps and demands he break it off, to which he replies, \"You can't tell me what to do. You're not my mother.\" Kitty takes great offense to this and storms off and makes herself a blender full of alcohol. Donna and Jackie help Fez realize that Kitty has been the closest thing he has to a mother and she thinks of Fez as her own son. Fez makes up with Kitty afterward.\n"}

It was developed by mFactory (pronounced \"em-factory\") and introduced in 1995. It introduced object-oriented concepts such as reusable objects, modifiers and behaviors into the multimedia authoring space dominated by Macromedia's Director software. mTropolis was bought in 1997 by Quark, which moved development from Burlingame, California to Denver and then cancelled the product one year later. Despite efforts by its fervent users to attempt to save their investment and beloved tool, negotiations and even a possible purchase offer never came to fruition.\n\nmTropolis (pronounced \"metropolis\") competed in the interactive multimedia product space dominated in the 1990s by Macromedia Director. The software's maker, mFactory (pronounced \"em-factory\"), founded in 1992, variously positioned mTropolis as an alternative and as an adjunct to Director.\n\nmTropolis was bought by Quark in 1997. The use of behaviors in mTropolis spurred Macromedia on to introduce behaviors in Director 6.0.\nI was there when Seery, Shepherd, meself and probably Greggy went over to the Mtrop user meetings. We straight out stole [behaviors] from \nthem.\n\n- \"Alex Zavatone (ex Macromedia) on the Direct-L Mailing List, Tue, 9 Sep 2008\"\nWhile multimedia CD-ROM authoring has largely been rendered irrelevant by online content distribution, mTropolis remains an interesting study in application design, and held a loyal following for many years.\n\nThe development environment was very different from the other tools around at the time - Apple Computer's HyperCard and others had a card based metaphor, and Macromedia Director had a film metaphor (the content area is called The Stage, the time line The Score, an assets library named The Cast, etc.). In mTropolis there were sections, subsections, and scenes. Assets would be placed onto the scene, and then combinations of behaviors and modifiers would be dragged onto the assets.\n\nPowerful interaction and animation could be created by making different modifiers send messages to each other, allowing a user to create something impressive fairly quickly, without any typing. There was a simple programming language, accessed via a Miniscript modifier, but most of the programming was achieved by attaching standard behaviors and modifiers, and making selections within the modifier pop-up menus.\n\nAccording to Starship Titanic author Douglas Adams, his team had originally selected mTropolis 1.0 for its development platform but it had to be abandoned for unspecified technical insufficiencies in favor of an in-house tool.\n\nOne criticism of the tool was that the integrated programming language, Miniscript, was lacking key features necessary for common tasks. Because mTropolis was conceived around a visual programming metaphor, mFactory engineers intentionally omitted control constructs such as conditional loops. To remedy such limitations, the third-party developer AX Logic produced the commercially-available Alien Studio modifier as a drop-in replacement for Miniscript.\n\nThe advent in version 1.1 of the mTropolis browser plug-in for Netscape Navigator, dubbed \"mPire,\" exposed a core architectural shortcoming. The binary file format was not cross-platform; in order to make a mTropolis element available for embedding on a web page, the author was required to save a Macintosh version and a separate Windows version. Hence the web server had to store redundant copies of the same content, consuming disk space and necessitating the use of loader pages to serve the file appropriate for the end user's operating system.\n\nWhile playback engines existed for both the Macintosh and Windows platforms, the mTropolis authoring system itself only ran on the Mac.\n\nJanuary 1995: Released at MacWorld San Francisco. Retail price $4,495.\n\nMay 1996: Added support for QuickTime VR 1.0. Retail price $1,195.\n\nOctober 1996: mFactory releases beta 1 of the mPire browser plug-in.\n\nMarch 1997: mFactory announces pre-order sales availability for version 2.0, due to ship in \"the second half of May.\" Retail price $995.\n\nMay 1997: Quark, Inc. purchases mFactory.\n\nMarch 1998: Quark announces that v2.0 would be furnished free-of-charge to registered mTropolis v1 customers, but that the product will not be made available for general purchase.\n\nDue to the way the mTropolis Player was separate from developer content, by viewing the files, it is easy to tell if a title was developed with mTropolis. A few CD-ROMs were created using mTropolis, including the BAFTA award winning MindGym, Scott Kim's Obsidian, A Sharp's King of Dragon Pass, the Muppets Treasure Island, Voyager's Fun With Architecture and The Magic World of Beatrix Potter.\n\n"}

Some of his work appeared under the pen name \"Mart Dellon.\"\n\nBorn in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Nodell was the son of Jewish immigrants. He attended the Art Institute of Chicago. He moved to New York City in the 1930s, where he attended Pratt Institute.\n\nNodell began his illustrating career in 1938, working first as a freelancer. In 1940 he provided some work for Sheldon Mayer, an editor at All-American Publications, one of three companies that ultimately merged to form National Comics Publications (present-day DC Comics). Interested in gaining more steady employment, Nodell created designs for a new character that would become the Golden Age Green Lantern (Alan Scott). The inspiration came in January 1940 at the 34th Street subway station in Manhattan. Nodell noticed a trainman waving a lantern along the darkened tracks. He coupled the imagery with elements from Richard Wagner's operatic Ring cycle as well as Chinese folklore and Greek mythology to create the hero.\n\nAs Nodell himself described in 2000:\nThe first adventure, drawn by Nodell (as Mart Dellon) and written by Bill Finger, appeared in \"All-American Comics\" #16 (July 1940). Nodell continued to use the pseudonym through at least \"All Star Comics\" #2 (Fall 1940). He said in 2000 he had used the pen name since, \"Comics were a forbidden literature, culturally unacceptable. It wasn't something you were proud of\". Nodell penciled and virtually always self-inked Green Lantern stories in \"All-American\" and \"All Star\" until the character got his own title, the premiere issue cover-dated July 1941. He would continue with it through to #25 (May 1947), very rarely drawing the covers, before being succeeded by a variety of artists including Howard Purcell, Irwin Hasen, and Alex Toth.\n\nNodell left All-American in 1947 and joined Timely Comics, the 1930s–40s forerunner of Marvel Comics), where he drew postwar stories of Captain America, the Human Torch and the Sub-Mariner. His work there was rarely signed, making idenfication difficult, though comics historians have confirmed that Nodell drew two well-known covers: The first issue of \"Marvel Tales\", Timely's horror-comics revamp of the company's flagship series \"Marvel Mystery Comics\"; and the penultimate issue (#74) of Captain America's book, which for its last two issues became the horror-oriented \"Captain America's Weird Tales\".\n\nIn 1950, Nodell left comics to work in advertising and later joined the Leo Burnett Agency in Chicago as an art director. In 1965, his design team there developed the long-running flour-company mascot the Pillsbury Doughboy.\n\nHis only known comics work in the interim are penciling the story \"The Glistening Death\" in the Avon Comics one-shot \"City of the Living Dead\" (1952), reprinted two decades later in the Skywald horror-comics magazine \"Psycho\" #1 (Jan. 1971); and \"Master of the Dead\" in Avon's \"Eerie\" (1951 series) #14, reprinted in Skywald's \"Nightmare\" #1 (Dec. 1970).\nIn the 1980s, Nodell submitted new work to DC, which led to his being rediscovered by comic fans. His first pieces included a 13-page puzzle-and-activity section in \"Super Friends Special\" #1 (1981), and drawing the Golden Age Harlequin in \"Who's Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe\" #10 (Dec. 1985). His final two published pieces of Green Lantern art were a one-page illustration of Golden Age Alan Scott Green Lantern in the 50th-anniversary issue \"Green Lantern\" vol. 3, #19 (Dec. 1991) and a one-page illustration of the Alan Scott Green Lantern and Superman in the one-shot \"Superman: The Man of Steel Gallery\" #1 (Dec. 1995). At 80, Nodell penciled his final comic-book work, the whimsical, 10-page Harlan Ellison adaptation \"Gnomebody\", scripted by John Ostrander and Ellison and inked by Jed Hotchkiss, in Dark Horse Comics' \"Harlan Ellison's Dream Corridor Quarterly\" #1 (Aug. 1996).\n\nNodell met his future wife, Carrie, at Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, in September 1940. They were married December 1, 1941, and afterward moved to Huntington, Long Island, to move in with Nodell's brother Simon, an engineer at Republic Aviation. They lived there two years before moving back to Brooklyn, New York City. The couple were living in West Palm Beach, Florida, by 2000. Nodell died December 9, 2006, in a nursing home in Muskego, Wisconsin, of natural causes, almost one month past his 91st birthday. They had two sons: Spencer, who lived in Waukesha, Wisconsin at the time of his father's death, and Mitchell.\n\nIn 2011, Nodell was nominated as a Judges' Choice for The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame.\n\n"}

It is also commonly used to refer to single scenes within the film to represent the film. \"Mise-en-scène\" has been called film criticism's \"grand undefined term\".\n\nWhen applied to the cinema, \"mise-en-scène\" refers to everything that appears before the camera and its arrangement—composition, sets, props, actors, costumes, and lighting. The \"mise-en-scène\", along with the cinematography and editing of a film, influence the verisimilitude or believability of a film in the eyes of its viewers. The various elements of design help express a film's vision by generating a sense of time and space, as well as setting a mood, and sometimes suggesting a character's state of mind. \"Mise-en-scène\" also includes the composition, which consists of the positioning and movement of actors, as well as objects, in the shot. These are all the areas overseen by the director. One of the most important people that collaborates with the director is the production designer. These two work closely to perfect all of the aspects of the \"mise-en-scène\" a considerable amount of time before the actual photography even begins. The production designer is generally responsible for the general look of the movie, leading various departments that are in charge of individual sets, locations, props, and costumes, among other things. Andre Bazin, a well-known French film critic and film theorist, describes the mise-en-scene aesthetic as emphasizing choreographed movement within the scene rather than through editing.\n\nBecause of its relationship to shot blocking, \"mise-en-scène\" is also a term sometimes used among professional screenwriters to indicate descriptive (action) paragraphs between the dialog.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10986798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10986798", "title": "Molecular symmetry", "text": "Molecular symmetry\n\nMolecular symmetry in chemistry describes the symmetry present in molecules and the classification of molecules according to their symmetry. Molecular symmetry is a fundamental concept in chemistry, as it can be used to predict or explain many of a molecule's chemical properties, such as its dipole moment and its allowed spectroscopic transitions. Many university level textbooks on physical chemistry, quantum chemistry, and inorganic chemistry devote a chapter to symmetry.\n\nThe predominant framework for the study of molecular symmetry is group theory. Symmetry is useful in the study of molecular orbitals, with applications such as the Hückel method, ligand field theory, and the Woodward-Hoffmann rules. Another framework on a larger scale is the use of crystal systems to describe crystallographic symmetry in bulk materials. \nMany techniques for the practical assessment of molecular symmetry exist, including X-ray crystallography and various forms of spectroscopy. Spectroscopic notation is based on symmetry considerations.\n\nThe study of symmetry in molecules makes use of group theory.\n\nThe point group symmetry of a molecule can be described by 5 types of symmetry element. \n\n\nThe five symmetry elements have associated with them five types of symmetry operation, which leave the molecule in a state indistinguishable from the starting state. They are sometimes distinguished from symmetry elements by a caret or circumflex. Thus, Ĉ is the rotation of a molecule around an axis and Ê is the identity operation. A symmetry element can have more than one symmetry operation associated with it. For example, the C axis of the square xenon tetrafluoride (XeF) molecule is associated with two Ĉ rotations (90°) in opposite directions and a Ĉ rotation (180°). Since Ĉ is equivalent to Ê, Ŝ to σ and Ŝ to \"î\", all symmetry operations can be classified as either proper or improper rotations.\n\nThe symmetry operations of a molecule (or other object) form a \"group\", which is a mathematical structure usually denoted in the form (\"G\",*) consisting of a set \"G\" and a binary combination operation say '*' satisfying certain properties listed below.\n\nIn a symmetry group, the group elements are the symmetry operations (\"not\" the symmetry elements), and the binary combination consists of applying first one symmetry operation and then the other. An example is the sequence of a C rotation about the z-axis and a reflection in the xy-plane, denoted σ(xy)C. By convention the order of operations is from right to left.\n\nA symmetry group obeys the defining properties of any group.\n\n(1) \"closure\" property: <br>           \nFor every pair of elements \"x\" and \"y\" in \"G\", the \"product\" \"x\"*\"y\" is also in \"G\". <br>           ( in symbols, for every two elements \"x\", \"y\"∈\"G\", \"x\"*\"y\" is also in \"G\" ). <br>This means that the group is \"closed\" so that combining two elements produces no new elements. Symmetry operations have this property because a sequence of two operations will produce a third state indistinguishable from the second and therefore from the first, so that the net effect on the molecule is still a symmetry operation.<br>\n(2) \"associative\" property: <br>           \nFor every \"x\" and \"y\" and \"z\" in \"G\", both (\"x\"*\"y\")*\"z\" and \"x\"*(\"y\"*\"z\") result with the same element in \"G\". <br>           \n( in symbols, (\"x\"*\"y\")*\"z\" = \"x\"*(\"y\"*\"z\" ) for every \"x\", \"y\", and \"z\" ∈ \"G\")<br>\n(3) \"existence of identity\" property: <br>           \nThere must be an element ( say \"e\" ) in \"G\" such that product any element of \"G\" with \"e\" make no change to the element. <br>           \n( in symbols, \"x\"*\"e\"=\"e\"*\"x\"= \"x\" for every \"x\"∈ \"G\" )<br>\n(4) \"existence of inverse\" property: <br>           \nFor each element ( \"x\" ) in \"G\", there must be an element \"y\" in \"G\" such that product of \"x\" and \"y\" is the identity element \"e\". <br>           \n\nThe \"order\" of a group is the number of elements in the group. For groups of small orders, the group properties can be easily verified by considering its composition table, a table whose rows and columns correspond to elements of the group and whose entries correspond to their products.\n\nThe successive application (or \"composition\") of one or more symmetry operations of a molecule has an effect equivalent to that of some single symmetry operation of the molecule. For example, a C rotation followed by a σ reflection is seen to be a σ' symmetry operation: σ*C = σ'. (Note that \"Operation A followed by B to form C\" is written BA = C). Moreover, the set of all symmetry operations (including this composition operation) obeys all the properties of a group, given above. So (\"S\",\"*\") is a group, where \"S\" is the set of all symmetry operations of some molecule, and * denotes the composition (repeated application) of symmetry operations.\n\nThis group is called the point group of that molecule, because the set of symmetry operations leave at least one point fixed (though for some symmetries an entire axis or an entire plane remains fixed). In other words, a point group is a group that summarizes all symmetry operations that all molecules in that category have. The symmetry of a crystal, by contrast, is described by a space group of symmetry operations, which includes translations in space.\n\nOne can determine the symmetry operations of the point group for a particular molecule by considering the geometrical symmetry of its molecular model. However, when one USES a point group, the operations in it are not to be interpreted in the same way. Instead the operations are interpreted as rotating and/or reflecting the vibronic (vibration-electronic) coordinates and these operations commute with the vibronic Hamiltonian. They are \"symmetry operations\" for that vibronic Hamiltonian. The point group is used to classify by symmetry the vibronic eigenstates. The symmetry classification of the rotational levels, the eigenstates of the full (rovibronic nuclear spin) Hamiltonian, requires the use of the appropriate permutation-inversion group as introduced by Longuet-Higgins. The relation between point groups and permutation-inversion groups is explained in this pdf file Link .\n\nAssigning each molecule a point group classifies molecules into categories with similar symmetry properties. For example, PCl, POF, XeO, and NH all share identical symmetry operations. They all can undergo the identity operation E, two different C rotation operations, and three different σ plane reflections without altering their identities, so they are placed in one point group, C, with order 6. Similarly, water (HO) and hydrogen sulfide (HS) also share identical symmetry operations. They both undergo the identity operation E, one C rotation, and two σ reflections without altering their identities, so they are both placed in one point group, C, with order 4. This classification system helps scientists to study molecules more efficiently, since chemically related molecules in the same point group tend to exhibit similar bonding schemes, molecular bonding diagrams, and spectroscopic properties.\n\nThe following table contains a list of point groups labelled using the Schoenflies notation, which is common in chemistry and molecular spectroscopy. The description of structure includes common shapes of molecules, which can be explained by the VSEPR model.\n\nThe symmetry operations can be represented in many ways. A convenient representation is by matrices. For any vector representing a point in Cartesian coordinates, left-multiplying it gives the new location of the point transformed by the symmetry operation. Composition of operations corresponds to matrix multiplication. Within a point group, a multiplication of the matrices of two symmetry operations leads to a matrix of another symmetry operation in the same point group. For example, in the C example this is:\nAlthough an infinite number of such representations exist, the irreducible representations (or \"irreps\") of the group are commonly used, as all other representations of the group can be described as a linear combination of the irreducible representations.\n\nFor each point group, a character table summarizes information on its symmetry operations and on its irreducible representations. As there are always equal numbers of irreducible representations and classes of symmetry operations, the tables are square.\n\nThe table itself consists of characters that represent how a particular irreducible representation transforms when a particular symmetry operation is applied. Any symmetry operation in a molecule's point group acting on the molecule itself will leave it unchanged. But, for acting on a general entity, such as a vector or an orbital, this need not be the case. The vector could change sign or direction, and the orbital could change type. For simple point groups, the values are either 1 or −1: 1 means that the sign or phase (of the vector or orbital) is unchanged by the symmetry operation (\"symmetric\") and −1 denotes a sign change (\"asymmetric\").\n\nThe representations are labeled according to a set of conventions:\n\n\nThe tables also capture information about how the Cartesian basis vectors, rotations about them, and quadratic functions of them transform by the symmetry operations of the group, by noting which irreducible representation transforms in the same way. These indications are conventionally on the righthand side of the tables. This information is useful because chemically important orbitals (in particular \"p\" and \"d\" orbitals) have the same symmetries as these entities.\n\nThe character table for the C symmetry point group is given below:\nConsider the example of water (HO), which has the C symmetry described above. The 2\"p\" orbital of oxygen has B symmetry as in the fourth row of the character table above, with x in the sixth column). It is oriented perpendicular to the plane of the molecule and switches sign with a C and a σ'(yz) operation, but remains unchanged with the other two operations (obviously, the character for the identity operation is always +1). This orbital's character set is thus {1, −1, 1, −1}, corresponding to the B irreducible representation. Likewise, the 2\"p\" orbital is seen to have the symmetry of the A irreducible representation (\"i.e\".: none of the symmetry operations change it), 2\"p\" B, and the 3\"d\" orbital A. These assignments and others are noted in the rightmost two columns of the table.\n\nHans Bethe used characters of point group operations in his study of ligand field theory in 1929, and Eugene Wigner used group theory to explain the selection rules of atomic spectroscopy. The first character tables were compiled by László Tisza (1933), in connection to vibrational spectra. Robert Mulliken was the first to publish character tables in English (1933), and E. Bright Wilson used them in 1934 to predict the symmetry of vibrational normal modes. The complete set of 32 crystallographic point groups was published in 1936 by Rosenthal and Murphy.\n\nPoint groups are useful for describing \"rigid\" molecules which undergo only small oscillations about a single equilibrium geometry, and for which the distorting effects of molecular rotation can be ignored, so that the symmetry operations all correspond to simple geometrical operations. However Longuet-Higgins has introduced a more general type of symmetry group suitable not only for rigid molecules but also for \"non-rigid\" molecules that tunnel between equivalent geometries (called \"versions\") and which can also allow for the distorting effects of molecular rotation. These groups are known as \"permutation-inversion\" groups, because the symmetry operations in them are energetically feasible permutations of identical nuclei, or inversion with respect to the center of mass, or a combination of the two.\n\nFor example, ethane (CH) has three equivalent staggered conformations. Tunneling between the conformations occurs at ordinary temperatures by \"internal rotation\" of one methyl group relative to the other. This is not a rotation of the entire molecule about the C axis. Although each conformation has D symmetry, as in the table above, description of the internal rotation and associated quantum states and energy levels requires the more complete permutation-inversion group G.\n\nSimilarly, ammonia (NH) has two equivalent pyramidal (C) conformations which are interconverted by the process known as nitrogen inversion. This is not an inversion in the sense used for point group symmetry operations of rigid molecules (i.e., the inversion of vibrational displacements and electronic coordinates in the center of mass) since NH has no inversion center. Rather it the inversion of all nuclei and electrons in the center of mass (close to the nitrogen atom), which happens to be energetically feasible for this molecule. The appropriate permutation-inversion group to be used in this situation is D(M) which is isomorphic with the point group D.\n\nAdditionally, as examples, the methane (CH) and H molecules have highly symmetric equilibrium structures with T and D point group symmetries respectively; they lack permanent electric dipole moments but they do have very weak pure rotation spectra because of rotational\ncentrifugal distortion. The permutation-inversion groups required for the complete study of CH and H are T(M) and D(M), respectively.\n\nA second and less general approach to the symmetry of nonrigid molecules is due to Altmann. In this approach the symmetry groups are known as \"Schrödinger supergroups\" and consist of two types of operations (and their combinations): (1) the geometric symmetry operations (rotations, reflections, inversions) of rigid molecules, and (2) \"isodynamic operations\", which take a nonrigid molecule into an energetically equivalent form by a physically reasonable process such as rotation about a single bond (as in ethane) or a molecular inversion (as in ammonia).\n\n\n"}

A. Robert Lee and Alan Velie note that the book's title \"quickly gained currency as a term to describe the efflorescence on literary works that followed the publication of N. Scott Momaday's \"House Made of Dawn\" in 1968\". Momaday's novel garnered critical acclaim, including the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1969.\n\nPrior to the publication of \"House Made of Dawn,\" few Native American authors had published works of fiction that reached wide readership. Writers such as William Apess, John Rollin Ridge and Simon Pokagon published works to little fanfare in the nineteenth century. Prior to the onset of WWII, Mourning Dove, John Milton Oskison, John Joseph Mathews, Zitkala-Sa, Charles Eastman and D'Arcy McNickle published literary works, although these works were relatively few in number.\n\nIn the work \"Native American Literatures: An Introduction,\" author Suzanne Lundquist suggests the Native American Renaissance has three elements:\n\n\nLincoln points out that in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a generation of Native Americans were coming of age who were the first of their respective tribal communities to receive a substantial English-language education, particularly outside Indian boarding schools, and with more graduating from colleges and universities. Conditions for Native people, while still very harsh during this period, had moved beyond the survival conditions of the early half of the century.\n\nA period of historical revisionism was underway, as historians were more willing to look at difficulties in the history of the invasion and colonization of the North American continent. As they explored the colonial and \"Wild West\" eras, some historians were more careful to represent events from the Native American perspective. This work inspired public interest in Native cultures and within Native American communities themselves; it was also a period of activism within Native American communities to achieve greater sovereignty and civil rights.\n\nThe ferment also inspired a group of young Native American writers, who emerged in the fields of poetry and novel-writing. In the span of a few years, these writers worked to expand the Native American literary canon.\n\nBy the 1980s, the rapid increase in materials and the development of Native American Studies departments and programs at several universities, such as the University of California, Los Angeles; Dartmouth College, and Eastern Washington University, led to the founding of scholarly journals, such as \"SAIL (Studies in American Indian Literature)\" and \"Wíčazo Ša Review\" (1985). With the heightened interest in Native American writing, publishers established specialized imprints, such as Harper and Row's Native American Publishing Programme, which had the goal of promoting new voices and publication opportunities.\n\nAlthough the primary use of the term has been literary, it has been used in a wider sense to describe \"an increasing prosperity and sense of achievement among Indians [...] a widespread economic and cultural rebirth.\" For example, Joan Nagel applies the term to the totality of \"the resurgence of American Indian ethnic identification and the renascence of tribal cultures during the 1970s and 1980s.\"\n\nWriters typically included in the \"Native American Renaissance\" include:\n\n\nJohn Gamber argues that the characteristics of Renaissance writers are as follows: devotion to a sacred landscape; a homing-in plot, often associated with a protagonist's return to the reservation; the treatment of a mixed-blood protagonist's dilemma between two worlds as a central theme. Erika Wurth points out that writers of this period were often concerned with writing for a non-Native audience. Wurth and Gamber both agree that a new phase in Native writing began with the works of writers such as Sherman Alexie, who rejected many of the formal and thematic concerns of Renaissance-era writing.\n\nThe term \"Native American Renaissance\" has been criticized on a number of points. As James Ruppert writes, \"Scholars hesitate to use the phrase because it might imply that Native writers were not producing significant work before that time, or that these writers sprang up without longstanding community and tribal roots.

Rebecca Tillett argues that \"While the definition of the recent burgeoning of Native writing as a \"renaissance\" is highly accurate in its description of the sudden growth in the numbers of Native writers finding publication, it is also profoundly inaccurate in its tendence to obscure the often specifically political histories of Indian oratory and writings upon which many Native writers are drawing.\"\n\n\n"}

For many years, the OSK was the only orchestra known to reside in Central Africa, though in recent times, the Kaposoka Orchestra began performing in Angola. It was the world's only all-black orchestra.\n\nConductor Armand Diangienda founded the orchestra in 1994 after losing his job as an airline pilot, naming it after his grandfather, religious leader Simon Kimbangu. At its conception, the group had only twelve amateur musicians that shared instruments and often used common materials as makeshift instrument parts. The group eventually grew to the size of about 200 amateur musicians and performers consisting of a full orchestra and choir.\n\nThe orchestra gained international attention when German filmmakers Martin Baer and Claus Wischmann created the documentary \"Kinshasa Symphony\" (2010) depicting the plight of the orchestra and its members in poverty stricken Kinshasa.\n\nIn May 2013 it was announced that Diangienda was to become an honorary member of the Royal Philharmonic Society, an award previously bestowed on such famous musicians as Mendelssohn, Rossini, Wagner, Brahms and Stravinsky.\n\n"}

Nineteen pieces were found in and around the churchyard before 1994, and the remainder were found during formal archaeological investigations by the University of York between 1994 and 2007 Tarbat Discovery Programme. The excavation director, Martin Carver has proposed that the majority of the carved pieces originated in four monumental crosses or cross-slabs of exceptional size and elaboration, placed around the site of St Colman's Church. One of these (TR1) carried four Pictish symbols, a second (TR2) had snake-headed interlace. A third (TR10, 20), features images of a complex beast and a row of apostles carrying books. This same stone originally carried along one edge a Latin inscription, \"IN NOMINE IHU XRI CRUX XRI IN COMMEMORATIONE REO... LII... DIE HAC...\" commemorating an unknown person. The fourth cross was covered in spiral and interlace ornament. Another large fragment, the so-called Boar Stone, has been identified as a sarcophagus lid with images of a boar and a wolf-like creature. Yet another fragment, the so-called Calf Stone, appears to belong to a shrine or screen. It depicts a bull and a cow tending to their calf. Other pieces from Portmahomack have been recognised as grave markers, incised with simple crosses. These are comparable to examples known from Iona and other early Christian sites in Argyll and western Scotland. Much of the Portmahomack sculpture has been assigned by radiocarbon dating of the layer in which it was found to the 8th century. Artistically, it has points of contact with sculpture in Iona and Northumbria, but its closest affiliation is with the great cross-slabs on other parts of the Tarbat peninsula, namely those at Hilton of Cadboll, Shandwick and Nigg, which one may perhaps assume were created by a school of masons centred on Tarbat. Together they demonstrate that the Tarbat peninsula was a prime centre of 8th-century European art.\n\nThe collection also includes a number of architectural pieces which are likely to have adorned an early stone church, including a probable label-stop and a gable finial. This collection, not yet fully published, is probably the most extensive to survive from early medieval Scotland.\n\n\n"}

Tenters were originally large wooden frames which were used as far back as the 14th century in the process of making woollen cloth. After a piece of cloth was woven, it still contained oil and dirt from the fleece. A craftsman called a fuller (also called a tucker or wa[u]lker) cleaned the woollen cloth in a fulling mill, and then had to dry it carefully or the woollen fabric would shrink. To prevent this shrinkage, the fuller would place the wet cloth on a tenter, and leave it to dry outdoors. The lengths of wet cloth were stretched on the tenter () using tenterhooks (hooked nails driven through the wood) all around the perimeter of the frame to which the cloth's edges (selvedges) were fixed, so that as it dried the cloth would retain its shape and size. In some manufacturing areas, entire tenter-fields, larger open spaces full of tenters, were once common.\n\nBy the mid-18th century, the phrase \"on tenterhooks\" came to mean being in a state of tension, uneasiness, anxiety, or suspense, i.e. figuratively stretched like the cloth on the tenter.\n\nJohn Ford's 1633 play \"Broken Heart\" contains the lines: \"There is no faith in woman. Passion, O, be contain'd! My very heart-strings Are on the tenters.\"\n\nIn 1690 the periodical \"The General History of Europe\" used the term in the modern sense: \"The mischief is, they will not meet again these two years, so that all business must hang upon the tenterhooks till then.\"\n\nIn 1826, English periodical \"Monthly magazine or British register of literature, sciences, and the belles-lettres\" contained the line \"I hope (though the wish is a cruel one) that my fair readers, if any such readers have deigned to follow me thus far, are on tenterhooks to know to whom the prize was adjudged.\" In a letter to his wife the same year, American educator Francis Wayland (waiting for his promised appointment as President of Brown University) wrote \"I was never so much on tenter hooks before.\"\n\nThe word \"tenter\" is still used today to refer to production line machinery employed to stretch polyester films and similar fabrics. The spelling \"stenter\" is also found.\n"}

R. R. Tolkien, compiled and edited by his son, Christopher Tolkien. The series shows the development over time of Tolkien's conception of Middle-earth as a fictional place with its own peoples, languages, and history, from his earliest notions of a \"mythology for England\" through to the development of the stories that make up \"The Silmarillion\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\". It is not a \"history of Middle-earth\" in the sense of being a chronicle of events in Middle-earth written from an in-universe perspective; it is instead an out-of-universe history of Tolkien's creative process. In 2000–01, the twelve volumes were republished in three limited edition omnibus volumes. Non-deluxe editions of the three volumes were published in 2002.\n\nSome of the content consists of earlier versions of already published works, while other portions are new material. These books are extremely detailed, often analysing a scrap of paper to provide the full evolution of two or even three different versions of a passage that were rewritten over each other. Despite the great amount of material in the twelve volumes, numerous unpublished texts are still known to exist in the Bodleian and Marquette University libraries, and in other papers held by individuals or organizations, such as the Elvish Linguistic Fellowship.\n\nThe first five books track the early history of \"The Silmarillion\" and related texts. Books six to nine discuss the development of \"The Lord of the Rings\"; book nine also discusses the Númenor story in the form of The Notion Club Papers. Books ten and eleven focus on material from the \"Silmarillion\" that Tolkien worked on after \"The Lord of the Rings\" was published, including the \"Annals of Beleriand\" and the \"Annals of Aman\". Book twelve discusses the development of the Appendices to \"The Lord of the Rings\" and examines assorted writings from the last years of Tolkien's life.\n\nChristopher Tolkien made the decision not to include any material related to \"The Hobbit\" in \"The History of Middle-earth\" because it was not originally intended to form part of the mythology, but was a children's story and originally not set in Middle-earth, but was revised during the writing of \"The Lord of the Rings\". \"The History of The Hobbit\" was published separately, in two volumes, in 2007 and was edited by John D. Rateliff\n\n\nA combined index was published six years after the series was completed as \"The History of Middle-earth: Index\" (2002).\n\nA shorter version of volume 9, omitting material not related to \"The Lord of the Rings\", was published as \"The End of the Third Age\"; this is usually sold as a boxed set along with volumes 6, 7 and 8 as \"The History of the Lord of the Rings\".\n\n"}

Other tales of this type include The Magic Swan Geese, The Seven Ravens, The Twelve Wild Ducks, Udea and her Seven Brothers, The Wild Swans, and The Twelve Brothers.\n\nA King gets lost in a forest, and an old woman helps him, on the condition that he marry her beautiful daughter. The King has a bad feeling about this but accepts anyway. He has six sons and a daughter from his first marriage, however, and fears that the children will be targeted by his new wife; so he sends them away and visits them in secret. \n\nThe new queen and now stepmother, who has learned witchcraft from her mother, finds out about her stepchildren and decides to get them out of her way. She sews six magical shirts and goes to the hidden castle where the children are hidden for safety, then tosses the shirts over the boys and transforms them into swans. \n\nThe brothers can only take their human forms for fifteen minutes every evening. They tell their still human younger sister that they've heard of a way to break such curses: she must make six shirts out of nettles and can't make a sound for six years or the spell will never be broken. The girl agrees to do this and runs away, hiding in a hunter's hut and dedicating herself solely to gathering the nettles and sewing in silence.\n\nYears later, the King of another country finds the girl doing this, is taken by her beauty, and takes her into the court with the intention of making her his queen. However, the King's snobbish mother hates her and does not consider her fit to be a Queen. When she gives birth to their first child, the wicked mother-in-law takes away the child and accuses the queen of killing and eating him, but the King refuses to believe it. \n\nThe young Queen gives birth to two other children, but twice again the mother-in-law hides them away and falsely claims that she has killed and eaten her babies. The King is unable to keep protecting her, and unable to properly defend herself, the queen is sentenced to be burned at the stake as a witch. All this time, she has held back her tears and her words, sewing and sewing the nettle shirts no matter what.\n\nOn the day of her execution, the Queen has all but finished making the shirts for her brothers. Only the last shirt misses a left arm. When she is brought to the stake she takes the shirts with her and when she is about to be burned, the seven years expire and the six swans come flying through the air. She throws the shirts over her brothers and they regain their human form, though the youngest prince's left arm remains a wing due to the missing sleeve. \n\nThe queen is now free to speak, and she can defend herself against the accusations. She does so with the support of her brothers. In the end, the evil mother-in-law is the one who is burned at the stake as punishment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Despite much destruction in Tibet itself, many of these survive, the dry climate of the Tibetan plateau assisting their survival, as the wet Indian climate has reduced survival of paintings from there. There are some regional differences, but the techniques described here cover the traditional wall paintings across this area. The wall paintings were executed on earthen plaster with the secco-technique. A secco-technique is a painting technique in which the pigments with their binder are employed to paint onto a dry (Italian: secco) wall.\n\nThe support for wall paintings in made of earthen plaster, usually consisting of more than one layer of earthen plaster, in which the last layer was rendered as smoothly as possible.\nThe support was covered by a smoothened ground, generally in white. Materials employed for the ground may be kaolin, chalk or gypsum, or any other white material deriving from an inert mineral. \nTo organise the painting, preliminary sketches were carried out. Generally this involved the geometric layout of the design with the help of snapped lines and/or rulers. Compasses were employed mainly for the construction of mandalas. Figures were roughly sketched, and then rendered with precise contours. These outlines are usually in black. Repetitive designs were in some cases achieved with the use of stencils. \n\nTraditionally, colour codes were employed to accelerate and simplify the colouring of the various ornaments and figures. For this purpose each section was given a number from 1-9 or an abbreviation of the name of the colour. Some paintings were embellished with raised ornaments (pastiglia-technique). Either a semi-liquid paste was applied to the painting surface, or a stamp had been previously produced from a mould and then applied onto the painting surface. Depending on the final visible colour of a painting, specific colours for the underpainting were employed. An ochre for example has an underpainting in a bright yellow. Similar to Tibetan paintings, the traditional painting was carried out with shading systems, such as a dry or wet shading system. Shading may be obtained with glazes, or with one of the dry shading systems, such as the dot-shading technique in which minuscle dots of colour cover the paintings surface. Specific details were then achieved with small paint brushes employing a variety of colours: black, white, ochre or red.\n\nSpecific ornaments of a representation were enriched with gold. This was either applied as a gold leaf or as powder in a binder.\n\n"}

His Ukrainian father, Ivan Danchenko, was an officer in the Imperial Russian army, and his mother, Alexandra Yagubyan (1829–1914), was Armenian. He went to high school in Tbilisi, continuing his education at Moscow State University (physical-mathematical and juridical departments 1876–79). \n\nIn 1879 he left the University for the theatre, starting as a theatre critic, and in 1881, his first play \"Dog-rose\", which was staged in one year by Maly Theatre, was published. \nHe was a teacher of Moskvin, Knipper and Meyerhold. \n\nIn 1919, he established the Musical Theatre of the Moscow Art Theatre, which was reformed into the Nemirovich-Danchenko Musical Theatre in 1926. In 1943 Nemirovich-Danchenko established the Moscow Art Theatre School, which is still extant. \n\nHe died of a heart attack on 25 April 1943, aged 84, in Moscow.\n\nNemirovich-Danchenko's Moscow Art Theatre staged Chekhov and Gorky drama with theretofore unknown naturalism and full expression. In addition, his theatre presented highly acclaimed Dostoevsky and Tolstoy dramatizations. It has been said that \"If Stanislavsky was the soul of Art Theatre, then Nemirovich was its heart\".\n\nNemirovich-Danchenko created the Moscow Art Theatre's acting and directing style, known for \"actors ensemble\" and its \"atmosphere\". Because of his directorial and production skills, the Moscow Art Theatre was considered, at the time, the best theatre in the world. But Nemirovich didn't write down his acting \"system\"and we know only the \"system of Stanislavski\". He was one of the first recipients of the title of People's Artist of the USSR in 1936. Later, he was awarded the USSR State Prize (1942, 1943), the Order of Lenin (3 May 1937), and Order of the Red Banner of Labour (25 February 1936).\n\n\n"}

The film is the sequel to \"Wayne's World\" (1992), which was adapted from a sketch on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\".\n\nRock and roll fans Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar now host their public-access television show, \"Wayne's World,\" from an abandoned factory in Aurora, Illinois. After an Aerosmith concert, Wayne has a dream in which he meets Jim Morrison and a \"weird naked Indian\" in a desert. Morrison convinces Wayne that his destiny is to organize a major music festival. Wayne and Garth dub the concert \"Waynestock\" and hire Morrison's former roadie, Del Preston. Their early attempts to sign bands and sell tickets fail, and Wayne wonders if the endeavor is futile.\n\nWayne's girlfriend Cassandra, singer of the band Crucial Taunt, has a new producer, Bobby Cahn, who tries to pull her away from Wayne and Illinois. Garth meets a beautiful woman, Honey Hornée. After Wayne admits spying on her due to his suspicion of Bobby's ulterior motives, Cassandra breaks up with him and becomes engaged to Bobby. Honey Hornée attempts to manipulate Garth into killing her ex-husband, but Garth ends the relationship.\n\nTickets are sold for Waynestock but no bands arrive. Leaving Garth to keep the rowdy crowd in check, Wayne disrupts Cassandra's wedding before escaping the ceremony with her and they get back together, in a scene closely resembling the finale of \"The Graduate\". Meanwhile, Garth has stage fright during the concert. Wayne returns to find the bands have still not arrived.\n\nIn the dream desert, Wayne and Garth consult Morrison, who says that the bands will not come and that all that matters is they tried. They become lost in the desert. Finding this unacceptable, Wayne and Garth reenact the ending of \"Thelma & Louise\", driving their car off a cliff while trying to find the bands. Finally, Wayne and Garth stage an ending in which the bands arrive and Waynestock is a success. Bobby arrives to Waynestock to get Cassandra but is not allowed inside.\n\nAfter the concert, the park is covered with trash and the \"weird naked Indian\" cries. Wayne and Garth begin to remove the litter, promising to clean the entire park.\n\nPenelope Spheeris, who directed the first film believes that Myers encouraged the studio not to have her back for the sequel due to personality conflicts with Myers during the making of the first film. She went on to direct another TV to big screen adaptation, \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" instead and was replaced by Stephen Surjik for the sequel.\n\nMyers' original script for \"Wayne's World 2\" had Wayne and Garth forming their own country and seceding from the US after finding an ancient scroll, in a story taken from the 1949 British comedy \"Passport to Pimlico.\" This version was well into pre-production before it came to light that the studio had no idea the script was based on a previous film and thus had not obtained the rights to \"Passport to Pimlico\". Production was immediately halted—director Surjik said: \"I could hear the chainsaws literally chopping the sets down.\"\n\nStudio executive Sherry Lansing was reportedly furious with Myers and threatened to ruin his life and career if he didn't immediately produce a new script.\n\n\"Wayne's World 2\" received mixed reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 61% approval rating, based on 44 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"The characters are still endearing, but the jokes in \"Wayne's World 2\" are more hit-and-miss the second time around\".\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film three out of four stars, and wrote that Wayne and Garth are \"impossible to dislike\".\n\nAlthough it was intended to be a Christmas season blockbuster, \"Wayne's World 2\" did not receive the box office intake or positive fan reaction that the first film did. Its final North American gross was $48 million, slightly more than its $40 million production budget, but much less than the original film's gross of over $100 million. \"Wayne's World 2\" also suffered from competition from other holiday season blockbusters such as \"Mrs. Doubtfire\", \"Schindler's List\", and \"The Pelican Brief\".\n\n\n"}
