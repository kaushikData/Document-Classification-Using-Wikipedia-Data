{"id": "58715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58715", "title": "1066 and All That", "text": "1066 and All That\n\n1066 and All That: A Memorable History of England, comprising all the parts you can remember, including 103 Good Things, 5 Bad Kings and 2 Genuine Dates is a tongue-in-cheek reworking of the history of England. Written by W. C. Sellar and R. J. Yeatman and illustrated by John Reynolds, it first appeared serially in \"Punch\" magazine, and was published in book form by Methuen & Co. Ltd. in 1930.\n\nRaphael Samuel saw \"1066 and All That\" as a product of the post-First World War debunking of British greatness, very much in the tradition of \"Eminent Victorians\" (1918): as he put it, \"that much underrated anti-imperialist tract \"1066 and All That\" punctured the more bombastic claims of drum-and-trumpet history\". \n\nBoth the Tory view of a 'great man' history, and the liberal pieties of Whig history are undermined in the work, in the (then contemporary) style of such serious historians as Namier and Herbert Butterfield. With its conflation of history and memory, and its deconstruction of \"standard\" historical narrative lines, the book can also be seen as an early post-modernist text.\n\nThe book is a parody of the style of history teaching in English schools at the time, in particular of \"Our Island Story\". It purports to contain \"all the History you can remember\", and, in sixty-two chapters, covers the history of England from Roman times through 1066 \"and all that\", up to the end of World War I, at which time \"America was thus clearly Top Nation, and history came to a .\" [full-stop, like a telegram]. The book is full of examples of half-remembered and mixed-up facts.\n\nAlthough the subtitle states that the book comprises \"103 Good Things, 5 Bad Kings and 2 Genuine Dates\", the book's preface mentions that originally four dates were planned, but last-minute research revealed that two of them were \"not memorable\". The two dates that \"are\" referenced in the book are 1066, the date of the Battle of Hastings and the Norman invasion of Britain (Chapter XI), and 55 BC, the date of the first Roman invasion of Britain under Julius Caesar (Chapter I). However, when the date of the Roman invasion is given, it is immediately followed by the date that Caesar was \"compelled to invade Britain again the following year (54 BC, not 56, owing to the peculiar Roman method of counting)\". Despite the confusion of dates the Roman Conquest is the first of 103 historical events in the book characterised as a \"Good Thing\", \"since the Britons were only natives at that time\".\n\nChapter II begins \"that long succession of Waves of which History is chiefly composed\", the first of which, here, is composed of Ostrogoths, Visigoths, mere Goths, Vandals, and Huns. Later examples are the \"Wave of Saints\", who include the Venomous Bead (Chapter III); \"Waves of Pretenders\", usually divided into smaller waves of two: an Old Pretender and a Young Pretender (Chapter XXX); plus the \"Wave of Beards\" in the Elizabethan era (Chapter XXXIII).\n\nAccording to Sellar and Yeatman, in English history kings are either \"Good\" or \"Bad\". The first \"Good King\" is the confusingly differentiated King Arthur/Alfred (Chapter V). Bad kings include King John, who when he came to the throne showed how much he deserved this epithet when he \"lost his temper and flung himself on the floor, foaming at the mouth and biting the rushes\" (Chapter XVIII). The death of Henry I from \"a surfeit of palfreys\" (recorded in other historical works as a \"surfeit of lampreys\", Chapter XIII) proves to be a paradigmatic case of the deaths of later monarchs through a surfeit of over-eating or other causes. Other \"memorable\" monarchs include the Split King (Henry IV, Part 1 and Henry IV, Part 2) and Broody Mary.\n\n\"Memorable\" events in English history include the Disillusion of the Monasteries (Chapter XXXI); the struggle between the Cavaliers (characterised as \"Wrong but Wromantic\") and the Roundheads (characterised as \"Right but Repulsive\") in the English Civil War (Chapter XXXV); and The Industrial Revelation (Chapter XLIX).\n\nThe book also contains five joke \"Test Papers\" interspersed among the chapters, which contain nonsense instructions including the famous \"Do not on any account attempt to write on both sides of the paper at once\" (Test Paper V), and \"Do not attempt to answer more than one question at a time\" (Test Paper I) and such unanswerable questions as \"How far did the Lords Repellent drive Henry III into the arms of Pedro the Cruel? (Protractors may not be used.)\" (Test Paper II).\n\nIn 1935, the musical comedy \"1066—and all that: A Musical Comedy based on that Memorable History by Sellar and Yeatman\" was produced. The book and lyrics were by Reginald Arkell; the music was composed by Alfred Reynolds. It was revived at the Palace Theatre, London, in 1945.\n\nThe narrative for the musical is based on the idea of an Everyman character, the Common Man, who is visiting a waxworks museum. He experiences some of the major events and characters of British history, starting with the Romans. \"What good did history ever do me?\" moans the Common Man. While his wife and son traipse round the waxworks, he dreams the waxworks come to life, singing and dancing and recalling the events and characters first met in dry-as-dust school lessons that are most likely to stick, however imperfectly, in an everyman-school-student's mind: Alfred burning the cakes; Canute inventing sea bathing; King John losing his washing, and Henry VI marrying VIII wives – or vice versa. From the Roman Conquest to the Modern Era of automobiles.\n\nA chorus of Roman soldiers sing about \"Going home\", and being \"on the road that leads to Rome. / We've been to Gaul, we've been to Spain / And now we're going home again / Rome, sweet home\". Later a chorus of monks sing about the horrors of meatless Friday meals in the abbey. A Puritan and a Cavalier sing a jaunty, flirting ditty, and so on.\n\nAt the end, the Common Man is run down by a passing taxi, and the Finale reprises the \"Going home\" song with suitably modified lyrics.\n\n\"1066 and All That\" inspired Paul Manning's \"1984 and All That\", dealing with the subsequent history of Britain and the rest of the world up to 1984, and written in the same style, with similar prose, illustrations and tests. (\"What caused the Wall Street Crash? Speculate wildly.\") The title also echoes George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\".\n\nNed Sherrin and Neil Shand wrote a sequel \"1956 and All That\", with the subtitle \"a memorable history of England since the war to end all wars (Two)\".\n\nScoular Anderson has written a humorous history of Scotland in two volumes: \"1314 and All That\" and \"1745 and All That\". Although the titles reflect Sellar and Yeatman's work, the style of writing and illustration is very different.\n\nIn 2005 Craig Brown released \"1966 and All That\", which copied the book's style (including elements like the end of chapter tests), recounting the remainder of the 20th century. In 2006 the book was adapted for BBC Radio 4 in four parts.\n\nRichard Armour's book \"It All Started With Columbus\" (1953, revised 1961) treats the history of the United States, from 1492 to the presidency of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, in a manner that owes a great deal to Sellar and Yeatman (\"Ferdinand and Isabella refused to believe the world was round, even when Columbus showed them an egg\"). Acknowledging the debt, Armour dedicated his book to Sellar and Yeatman.\n\nDave Barry's 1989 book \"\" is another treatment of American history reminiscent of \"1066 and All That\", though Sellar and Yeatman are not acknowledged. (\"The first major president to be elected after the War of 1812 was President Monroe Doctrine, who became famous by developing the policy for which he is named.\")\n\nMatthew Sturgis' book \"1992 and All This\" (Macmillan, 1991) is a \"humorous look at Europe in preparation for 1992 when Britain officially becomes part of the Continent. Much of the humour focuses on the differences between the British and the Europeans.\"\n\nMalcolm Knox's 2009 book \"1788 Words or Less\" gives a Sellar and Yeatman-esque twist to the history of Australia.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39462426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39462426", "title": "American Sniper (book)", "text": "American Sniper (book)\n\nAmerican Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History is an autobiography by United States Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, written with Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice. With 255 kills, 160 of them officially confirmed by the Pentagon, Kyle is the deadliest marksman in U.S. military history. The book was published by William Morrow and Company on January 2, 2012 and appeared on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list for 37 weeks.\n\nThe memoir has sold over 1.2 million copies across all formats (hardcover, paper, and ebook), including 700,000 copies in 2015 alone, making it one of the best-selling books of 2015. It landed atop all the major best-seller lists including the aforementioned \"The New York Times\", and \"Publishers Weekly\", \"USA Today\" and No. 2 on \"Amazon\". Its film adaptation directed by Clint Eastwood and featuring Bradley Cooper as Kyle was released in 2014.\n\n\"American Sniper\" tells the story of Chris Kyle, a Navy SEAL who completed four tours in Iraq from 1999–2009. The book describes Kyle's upbringing in Odessa, Texas, Navy SEAL training, and combat experiences in Iraq.\n\nKyle describes his role in the battle for control of Ramadi, events that led to Iraqi insurgents' nicknaming Kyle the \"Devil of Ramadi\" and placing a bounty on his head.\n\nKyle writes that after his first confirmed kill, \"the others come easy. I don't have to psych myself up, or do something special mentally—I look through the scope, get my target in the cross hairs, and kill my enemy, before he kills one of my people.\"\n\nIn July 2014, the sub-chapter \"Punching Out Scruff Face\" was removed from later editions of the book, after a three-week trial in U.S. Federal Court wherein the jury found that the author, Chris Kyle, had unjustly enriched himself by defaming plaintiff Jesse Ventura. In the book, Kyle described blackening the eye of \"Scruff Face\", whom he later identified in media interviews as Jesse Ventura. The jury awarded Ventura $500,000 for defamation and $1,345,477.25 for unjust enrichment. In December 2014, attorneys for Ventura filed a separate lawsuit against HarperCollins, the parent company of the publisher, for failing to check the accuracy of the story it used in publicity. The suit alleges that the false account used in publicity had \"increased sales\" and generated \"millions of dollars for HarperCollins.\" On June 13, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit vacated the verdict on the defamation count, remanding the case for a new trial on that count, and reversed the unjust enrichment verdict outright.\n\nSome sources claimed Kyle's family had said all his book proceeds were donated to veterans' charities. \"Salon\" and \"National Review\" disputed the donation amount, asserting that around 2 percent ($52,000) went to the charities, while Kyle's family received $3 million.\n\nIn May 2016, \"The Intercept\" claimed that Kyle's autobiography \"embellished\" his military record, and that he had been warned by Navy officials about the inaccuracies before publication. Others, including co-author Scott McEwen, disputed this. On May 28, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" did an analysis, concluding that the newly released internal Navy documents were inconclusive — that the document that typically is the definitive record of military service matched Kyle's claims and that the Navy had not yet publicly stated this document or the facts within it were incorrect. Kyle's DD Form 214 listed a total of two Silver Stars and six Bronze stars, more than he claimed in his book.\nOn July 8, 2016, the U.S. Navy corrected Kyle's DD-214 regarding some decorations listed on his original discharge document. The Navy revised it to one Silver Star and four Bronze Stars with valor. The Navy said \"Kyle would have played no role in the production of his personnel files other than signing the DD-214 upon his discharge\" and \"[a]fter thoroughly reviewing all available records, the Navy determined an error was made\" and \"issued a corrected copy of the DD-214, which accurately reflects Kyle's years of honorable and extraordinary service.\"\n\nClint Eastwood's film \"American Sniper\" (2014) is based on Kyle's autobiography. It had its world première on November 11, 2014, at the American Film Institute Festival, followed by a limited theatrical release in the United States on December 25, 2014. It received a wide release January 16, 2015. Kyle is portrayed by Bradley Cooper, and his wife Taya Kyle is portrayed by Sienna Miller. For his portrayal of Kyle, Cooper received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, and the film was nominated in five other categories, including Best Picture. The film won the Academy Award for Best Sound Editing.\n"}

Returning to an earlier project of providing an overview of psychoanalysis, Freud began writing this work in Vienna in 1938 as he was waiting to leave for London. By September 1938 he had written three-quarters of the book, which was published in 1940, a year after his death. Composed of three sections, the \"Outline\" opens with a description of the psychic apparatus, including its spatial organization and differentiation into agencies. The ego, which develops through contact with the outside world, attempts to reconcile the needs of the id, the superego, and reality. The id represents the hereditary past, the superego, tradition. Drives, which are basically conservative and located in the id, represent somatic needs for the psyche. Eros and the destruction, or death, impulse, whether antagonists or combined in biological functions, are the two fundamental impulses.\n"}
{"id": "284752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=284752", "title": "Anastasia (1997 film)", "text": "Anastasia (1997 film)\n\nAnastasia is a 1997 American animated musical fantasy adventure film directed and produced by former Walt Disney Feature Animation directors, Don Bluth and Gary Goldman in association with Fox Animation Studios, distributed by 20th Century Fox, and starring the voices of Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Kelsey Grammer, Hank Azaria, Christopher Lloyd, Bernadette Peters, Kirsten Dunst and Angela Lansbury. The film is a loose adaptation of the legend of Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, which claims that she, in fact, escaped the execution of her family. Its basic plot centers around an eighteen-year-old amnesiac orphan named Anya who, in hopes of finding some trace of her family, sides with con men who wish to take advantage of her likeness to the Grand Duchess; thus the film shares its plot with Fox's prior film from 1956, which, in turn, was based on the 1955 play of the same name by Marcelle Maurette.\n\nThe film was met with criticism by some historians for its fantastical retelling of the life of the Grand Duchess. Though it enjoyed a positive reception from many critics, the historical inaccuracies were panned. From a $50 million budget, \"Anastasia\" grossed over $139 million worldwide, making it the most profitable film from Bluth and Fox Animation Studios to date. It received nominations for several awards, including for Best Original Song (\"Journey to the Past\") and Best Original Musical or Comedy Score at the 70th Academy Awards. The success of \"Anastasia\" spawned various adaptations of the film into other media, including a direct-to-video spin-off film, a computer game, books, toys and a stage musical, which premiered in 2016.\n\nIn 1916, Saint Petersburg, Russia, Tsar Nicholas II hosts a ball at the Catherine Palace to celebrate the Romanov tricentennial. His mother, the Dowager Empress Marie Feodorovna, is visiting from Paris, France and gives a music box and a necklace inscribed with the words \"Together in Paris\" as parting gifts to her youngest granddaughter, 8-year-old Grand Duchess Anastasia. The ball is suddenly interrupted by the sorcerer Grigori Rasputin, the former royal adviser to the Romanov family until he was exiled for treason. Seeking revenge, Rasputin sold his soul in exchange for an unholy reliquary, which he uses to place a curse on the Romanovs, sparking the Russian Revolution. During the siege of the palace, only Marie and Anastasia are able to escape with the aid of 10-year-old servant boy Dimitri, who shows them a secret passageway in Anastasia's bedroom. Rasputin confronts the two royals outside on a frozen river, only to fall through the ice and drown. The pair manage to reach a moving train, but only Marie climbs aboard while Anastasia falls, hitting her head on the platform and suffering amnesia.\n\nTen years later, Russia is under communist rule and Marie has publicly offered 10 million rubles for the safe return of her granddaughter. Dimitri and his friend/partner-in-crime Vladimir search for an Anastasia look-alike to bring to Paris so they can collect the reward. Elsewhere, Anastasia—now 18 years old and going by the name of \"Anya\"—leaves the rural orphanage where she grew up, still suffering from amnesia. Accompanied by a stray puppy she names \"Pooka\", she decides to head to Paris, inspired by the inscription on the necklace she still has, but finds she is unable to leave Russia without an exit visa. An old woman advises her to see Dimitri at the abandoned palace, where he and Vladimir have made residence; there, the two men are impressed by her resemblance to the \"real\" Anastasia, and decide to take her with them to Paris.\n\nBartok, Rasputin's albino bat minion, is nearby and notices his master's dormant reliquary suddenly revived by Anastasia's presence; it drags him to limbo, where Rasputin, slowly decomposing, survives. Enraged to hear that Anastasia escaped the curse, Rasputin sends his demonic minions from the reliquary to kill her; despite two attempts, the trio manage to (unwittingly) foil his plans, forcing Rasputin and Bartok to travel back to the surface.\n\nThe trio eventually reach Paris and go to meet Marie, who has given up the search after being tricked by numerous imposters. Despite this, Marie's cousin Sophie quizzes Anastasia to confirm her identity. Though Anastasia offers every answer taught to her, Dimitri finally realizes she is the real Anastasia when she (without being taught to) vaguely recalls how he helped her escape the palace siege. Sophie, also convinced, arranges a meeting with Marie at the Palais Garnier Opera house. There, Dimitri tries to establish an introduction but Marie refuses, having already heard of Dimitri's initial scheme to con her. Anastasia overhears the conversation and angrily leaves. Dimitri drags Marie to see Anastasia, who regains her memories as they converse. Convincing the empress of her identity, the two are joyfully reunited.\n\nMarie offers Dimitri the reward money the next day, recognizing him as the servant boy who saved them from the siege; to her surprise, he refuses it and leaves for Russia. At Anastasia's return celebration, Marie informs her of Dimitri's gesture, leaving Anastasia torn between staying or going with him. Pooka suddenly runs off; Anastasia chases him to the Pont Alexandre III, where she is trapped and attacked by Rasputin. Dimitri returns to save her, but is soon injured and knocked unconscious. In the struggle, Anastasia manages to get hold of Rasputin's reliquary and crushes it under her foot, avenging her family as Rasputin disintegrates and dies.\n\nIn the aftermath, Anastasia and Dimitri reconcile after Anastasia discovers the truth; they elope, and Anastasia sends a farewell letter to Marie and Sophie, promising to return one day. The couple are then seen kissing on a riverboat. Bartok shares a kiss with a female bat before bidding the audience farewell.\n\n\nJ. K. Simmons, Victoria Clark, and Lillias White were among the ensemble and character voices\n\nIn May 1994, \"The Los Angeles Times\" reported that Don Bluth and Gary Goldman had signed a long-term deal to produce animated features with 20th Century Fox with the studio channeling more than $100 million in constructing the animation studio. They selected Phoenix, Arizona, for the location of the new animation studio because the state offered the company about $1 million in job training funds and low-interest loans for the state-of-the-art digital animation equipment, with a staff of 300 artists and technicians, a third of whom worked with Bluth and Goldman in Dublin, Ireland, for Sullivan Bluth Studios. For their first project, the studio insisted they select one out of a dozen existing properties which they owned where Bluth and Goldman suggested adapting \"The King and I\" and \"My Fair Lady\", though Bluth and Goldman felt it would be impossible to improve on Audrey Hepburn's performance and Lerner and Loewe's score. Following several story suggestions, the idea to adapt \"Anastasia\" originated from Fox Filmed Entertainment CEO Bill Mechanic. They would later adapt story elements from \"Pygmalion\" with the peasant Anya being molded into a regal woman.\n\nEarly into production, Bluth and Goldman began researching the actual events through enlisting former CIA agents stationed in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Around this same time, screenwriter Eric Tuchman had written a script that co-screenwriter Bruce Graham described as being \"very adult, very based in reality, all about politics, and without any magic or comedy\". Eventually, Bluth and Goldman decided the history of Anastasia and the Romanov dynasty was too dark for their film. In 1995, Graham and Susan Gauthier reworked Tuchman's script into a lighthearted romantic comedy. When Graham and Gauthier moved onto other projects, husband-and-wife screenwriting team Bob Tzudiker and Noni White were hired for additional rewrites. Actress Carrie Fisher also made uncredited rewrites of the film particularly the scene in which Anya leaves the orphanage for Paris.\n\nFor the villains, Bluth also did not take into consideration depicting Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks, and initially toyed with the idea of a police chief with a vendetta against Anastasia. Instead, they decided to have Grigori Rasputin as the villain with Goldman explaining it was because of \"all the different things they did to try to destroy Rasputin and what a horrible man he really was, the more it seemed appetizing to make him the villain\". In reality, Rasputin was already dead when the Romanovs were assassinated. In addition to this, Bluth created the idea for Bartok, the albino bat, as a sidekick for Rasputin. \"I just thought the villain had to have a comic sidekick, just to let everyone know that it was all right to laugh. A bat seemed a natural friend for Rasputin. Making him a white bat came later - just to make him different.\" Composers Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens recalled being at Au Bon Pain in New York City where Rasputin and Bartok were pitched, and being dismayed at the decision to go down a historically inaccurate route; they made their stage musical adaption \"more sophisticated, more far-reaching, more political\" to encompass their original vision.\n\nBluth stated that Meg Ryan was his first and only choice for the title character. However, Ryan was indecisive about accepting the role due to its dark historical events. To persuade her, the animation team took an audio clip of Annie Reed from \"Sleepless in Seattle\" and created an animation reel based on it which was screened for her following an invitation to the studio. \"I was blown away that they did that\", Ryan later confessed, and accepted the role. Before Ryan was cast, Broadway singer and actress Liz Callaway was brought in to record several demos of the songs hoping to land a job in background vocals, but were liked well enough by the songwriters that were ultimately used in the final film. Cusack openly admitted after being cast that he couldn't sing, in which his singing duties were performed by Jonathan Dokuchitz.\n\nPeter O'Toole was considered for the role of Rasputin, but Christopher Lloyd was hired because of his involvement with the \"Back to the Future\" trilogy. Bartok was initially written for Woody Allen, but the studio was reluctant to hire him following revelations of his relationship with his ex-partner Mia Farrow's adoptive daughter, Soon-Yi Previn. Martin Short was also considered, but Hank Azaria won the role ten minutes into his audition.\n\nThe film score was composed, co-orchestrated, and conducted by David Newman, whose father, Alfred Newman, composed the score of the 1956 film of the same name. The songs, of which \"Journey to the Past\" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song, were written by Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty. The first song they wrote for the project was \"Once Upon a December\"; it was written during a heatwave \"so [they were] sweating and writing winter imagery\". The film's soundtrack was released in CD and audio cassette format on October 28, 1997.\n\n20th Century Fox scheduled for \"Anastasia\" to be released on November 21, 1997, notably a week after the 1997 re-release of Disney's \"The Little Mermaid\". Disney claimed it had long-planned for the 17-day re-release to coincide with a consumer products campaign leading into Christmas and the film's home video release in March 1998, as well continue the tradition for re-releasing the film within a seven- to eight-year interval. In addition to this, Disney would release several competing family films including \"Flubber\" on the following weekend, as well as a double feature of \"George of the Jungle\" and \"Hercules\". As a response, Disney refused to advertise for \"Anastasia\" on the ABC program \"The Wonderful World of Disney\", and banned its corporate sponsors from airing film clips during their television commercials. Commenting on the fierce competition between the two films, Disney spokesman John Dreyer brushed off allegations of studio rivalry, claiming \"We always re-release our movies around holiday periods\". However, Fox executives refused to believe Dreyer's statement with Bill Mechanic responding that \"It's a deliberate attempt to be a bully, to kick sand in our face. They can't be trying to maximize their own business; the amount they're spending on advertising is ridiculous...It's a concentrated effort to keep our film from fulfilling its potential.\"\n\n\"Anastasia\" was accompanied with a marketing campaign at more than $50 million with promotional sponsors from Burger King, Dole Food Company, Hershey, Chesebrough-Ponds, Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Shell Oil, and the 1997 U.S. Figure Skating Championships. Overall, the marketing costs exceeded that of \"Independence Day\" by more than 35 percent. For merchandising, Fox selected Galoob to license dolls based on Anastasia. Many storybooks adapted from the film were released by Little Golden Books. In August 1997, the SeaWorld theme parks in San Diego and Orlando featured a 40-foot-long, 20-foot-high inflatable playground for children called \"Anastasia's Kingdom\".\n\nOn April 28, 1998, \"Anastasia\" was released on VHS and sold eight million units. On March 14, 2006, the film was reissued on a two-disc \"Family Fun Edition\" DVD with the film in its original theatrical 2.35:1 widescreen format. The first disc contained the film, an optional audio commentary from directors/writers Don Bluth and Gary Goldman, and bonus features. The second disc contained a making-of documentary, music video and making-of featurette of Aaliyah's \"Journey to the Past\", and additional bonus content. The film was released on Blu-ray on March 22, 2011.\n\n\"Anastasia\" received a positive reception from critics. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 85% based on 52 reviews with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website's consensus reads, \"Beautiful animation, an affable take on Russian history, and strong voice performances make \"Anastasia\" a winning first film from Fox animation studios.\" Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" awarded the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, writing, \"The result is entertaining and sometimes exciting\". \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\" described \"Anastasia\" as \"charming\" and \"entertaining\", concluding, \"\"Anastasia\" serves up a tasty tale about a fairy-tale princess\". Lisa Osbourne of \"Boxoffice\" called the film \"pure family entertainment.\" Awarding the film three out of five stars, \"Empire\"'s Philip Thomas wrote, \"Historical inaccuracies aside, Anastasia manages to be a charming little movie\".\n\nSeveral critics have drawn positive comparisons between \"Anastasia\" and the Disney films released during the Disney Renaissance, noting similarities in their story and animation styles. Marjorie Baumgarten of \"The Austin Chronicle\" awarded the film three out of five stars. Likening its quality to that of a Disney animated film, Baumgarten wrote that \"Anastasia\" \"may not beat Disney at its own game, but it sure won't be for lack of trying\". Baumgarten continued, \"[t]his sumptuous-looking film clearly spared no expense in its visual rendering; its optical flourishes and attention to detail aim for the Disney gold standard and, for the most part, come pretty darn close\". \"The Phoenix\" Jeffrey Gantz jokingly stated, \"[i]f imitation is indeed the sincerest form of flattery, then the folks at Disney should feel royally complimented by Twentieth Century Fox's new animated feature about Tsar Nicholas II's youngest daughter.\" Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote, \"Fox's challenge to the Disney empire is a beautifully animated musical\". However, Gleiberman continued, \"\"Anastasia\" has the Disney house style down cold, yet the magic is missing.\"\n\nCritical reception in Russia was also, for the most part, positive despite the artistic liberties that the film took with Russian history. Gemini Films, the Russian distributor of \"Anastasia\", stressed the fact that the story was \"not history\", but rather \"a fairy tale set against the background of real Russian events\" in the film's Russian marketing campaign so that its Russian audience would not view \"Anastasia\" \"as a historical film\". As a result, many Russians praised the film for its art and storytelling and saw it as \"not so much a piece of history but another Western import to be consumed and enjoyed\".\n\nSome Russian Orthodox Christians, on the other hand, found \"Anastasia\" to be an offensive depiction of the Grand Duchess, who was canonized as a new martyr in 1981 by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia. Many historians echoed their sentiments, criticizing the film as a \"sanitized, sugar-coated reworking of the story of the Czar's youngest daughter.\" While the filmmakers acknowledged the fact that \"\"Anastasia\" uses history only as a starting point\", others complained that the film would provide its audience with misleading facts about Russian history, which, according to the author and historian Suzanne Massie, \"has been falsified for so many years\". Similarly, the amateur historian Bob Atchison said that \"Anastasia\" was akin to someone making a film in which Anne Frank \"moves to Orlando and opens a crocodile farm with a guy named Mort\".\n\nSome of Anastasia's contemporary relatives also felt that the film was distasteful, but most Romanovs have come to accept the \"repeated exploitation of Anastasia's romantic tale...with equanimity\".\n\nA limited release of \"Anastasia\" at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on the weekend of November 14, 1997, grossed $120,541. The following week, the wide release of \"Anastasia\" in the United States made $14.1 million (for an average of about $5,692 from 2,478 theaters), which placed it as the #2 film for the weekend of November 21–23, 1997. By the end of its theatrical run, \"Anastasia\" had grossed $58.4 million in the North American box office and $81.4 million internationally. The worldwide gross totaled up to about $139.8 million, making it Don Bluth's highest-grossing film to date and beating out his next highest-grossing film, \"An American Tail\", by about $55 million. It should also be noted that this was Don Bluth's first financially successful film since \"All Dogs Go to Heaven\".\n\n\"Anastasia On Ice\" was a licensed adaptation produced by Feld Entertainment's on ice unit that ran from at least 1998 to 1999.\n\nIn 1999 a direct-to-video spin-off and prequel called \"Bartok the Magnificent\" was released which focused on the character of Bartok.\n\nOn April 21, 2015, Hartford Stage, Hartford, Connecticut, announced that they will premiere a new stage production of \"Anastasia\", with the book by Terrence McNally, lyrics by Lynn Ahrens, music by Stephen Flaherty and directed by Darko Tresnjak. The production ran from May 13 through June 19, 2016.\n\nIt is an original new musical combining both the 1956 Fox film and the 1997 animated film. According to Tresnjak, the musical features six songs from the animated movie and additionally includes 16 new songs. Additionally, there have been some newly rewritten characters including Checkist secret Police officer Gleb Vaganov (in the place of Rasputin), and Lily, who has been renamed in the place of Sophie. McNally said \"This is a stage version for a modern theatre audience...The libretto’s 'a blend' of old and new...There are characters in the musical that appear in neither the cartoon nor the Ingrid Bergman version.”\n\nThe Hartford production featured Christy Altomare as Anastasia/Anya, Derek Klena as Dimitri, Mary Beth Peil as The Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna, Manoel Felciano as Gleb Vaganov, John Bolton as Vladimir, Caroline O'Connor as Lily, and Nicole Scimeca as Young Anastasia. The musical transferred to Broadway with much of the original Hartford cast, opening on April 24, 2017, at the Broadhurst Theater to mixed reviews.\n\n\"Anastasia\" received the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Family Film and was nominated for 7 others, including two Academy Awards in the categories of \"Best Original Musical or Comedy Score\" (lost to \"The Full Monty\") and \"Best Original Song\" for \"Journey to the Past\" (lost to My Heart Will Go On from \"Titanic\"). The R&B singer Aaliyah performed her pop single version of \"Journey to the Past\" at the 70th Academy Awards.\n\n"}

{"id": "10368329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10368329", "title": "Beit She'arim National Park", "text": "Beit She'arim National Park\n\nBeit She'arim (, \"House of the Gates\") is the currently used name for the ancient Jewish town of Bet She'arāyim (, \"House of Two Gates\") or Kfar She'arāyim (, \"Village of Two Gates\"). The site, located on a hill, was known initially by its Arabic name Sheikh Ibreik or Sheikh Abreik, and which historical geographer Samuel Klein in 1936 identified as Talmudic Beit She'arim. Another Arabic name is \"bayt al-ġurabāʾ\" ().\n\nThe partially excavated archaeological site consists mainly of an extensive necropolis of rock-cut tombs and some remains of the town itself. The site is managed by the National Parks Authority as the Beit She'arim National Park. It borders the town of Kiryat Tiv'on on the northeast and is located five kilometres west of Moshav Beit She'arim. It is situated 20 km east of Haifa in the southern foothills of the Lower Galilee.\n\nIn 2015 it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The rationale of the committee was as follows: The town's vast necropolis, carved out of soft limestone, contains more than 30 burial cave systems. Although only a portion of the necropolis has been excavated, it has been likened to a book inscribed in stone. Its catacombs, mausoleums, and sarcophagi are adorned with elaborate symbols and figures as well as an impressive quantity of incised and painted inscriptions in Hebrew, Aramaic, Palmyrene, and Greek, documenting two centuries of historical and cultural achievement. The wealth of artistic adornments contained in this, the most ancient extensive Jewish cemetery in the world, is unparalleled anywhere.\n\nAccording to Moshe Sharon, following Yechezkel Kutscher, the name of the city was Beit She'arayim or Kfar She'arayim (the House/Village of Two Gates). The ancient Yemenite Jewish pronunciation of the name is also \"Bet She'arayim\", which is more closely related to the Ancient Greek rendition of the name, i.e. Βησάρα, \"Besara\".\n\nThe popular orthography for the Hebrew word for house, , is \"beit\", while the traditional King James one is \"beth\", the effort being now to replace both with the etymologically better suited \"bet\".\n\nPottery shards discovered at the site indicate that a first settlement there dates back to the Iron Age.\n\nBeit She'arayim was founded at the end of the 1st century BCE, during the reign of King Herod. The Roman Jewish historian Josephus Flavius, in his \"Vita\", referred to the city in Greek as Besara, the administrative center of the estates of Queen Berenice in the Jezreel Valley.\n\nBenjamin Mazar described it as a prosperous Jewish town eventually destroyed by fire in 352, at the end of the Jewish revolt against Gallus and that after some time it was renewed as a Byzantine city, but more recent research shows that the Gallus revolt had a much lesser impact on the town. The Galilee earthquake of 363 did damage Bet She'arayim, but without long-lasting effects.\n\nAfter the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, the Sanhedrin (Jewish legislature and supreme council) moved to Beit She'arayim. The town is mentioned rabbinical literature as an important center of Jewish learning during the 2nd century. Rabbi Judah the Prince (Yehudah HaNasi), head of the Sanhedrin and compiler of the Mishna, lived there. In the last seventeen years of his life, he moved to Sepphoris for health reasons, but planned his burial in Beit She'arim. According to tradition, he owned there land he received as a gift from his friend, the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus. The most desired burial place for Jews was the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem, but in 135 CE, when Jews were barred from the area, Beit She'arim became an alternative. The fact that Rabbi Judah was buried there led many other Jews from all over the country and from the Jewish Diaspora, from nearby Phoenicia to far-away Himyar in Yemen, to be buried next to his grave.\n\nWhile it was originally thought that Bet She'arayim was destroyed during the Jewish revolt against Gallus in the mid-4th century, recent research has revealed the destruction to be far less extensive. An earthquake in 386 caused some damage, but the town recovered and enjoyed prosperity during the era of Byzantine rule. Almost 300 inscriptions primarily in Greek, but also in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Palmyrene were found on the walls of the catacombs containing numerous sarcophagi.\n\nFrom the beginning of the Early Islamic period (7th century), settlement was sparse. Excavations uncovered 75 lamps dating to the period of Umayyad (7th-8th centuries) and Abassid (8th-13th centuries) rule over Palestine. A large Abbasid-period glassmaking facility from the 9th century was also found at the site (see below).\n\nThere is some evidence of activity in the former city area and necropolis dating to the Crusader period (12th century), probably connected to travellers and temporary settlement.\n\nA small Arab village called Sheikh Bureik was located here in the late 16th century. A map by Pierre Jacotin from Napoleon's invasion of 1799 showed the place, named as \"Cheik Abrit.\"\n\nThe village is mentioned again in The Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) citing data from 1859, and in 1875 by Victor Guérin. In 1872, the Ottoman authorities sold Shayk Abreik (together with a total of 23 villages and some seventy square miles of land) for £20,000 to the Sursuk family of Lebanon. \"The Survey of Western Palestine\", published in 1881, describes Sheikh Abreik as a small village situated on a hill with a conspicuous \"maqam\" (sanctuary, holy tomb) located to the south. The village houses were made mostly of mud, and it belonged to the Sursuk family. The population at this time was estimated to be around 150. During World War I, the \"finest oaks\" of Sheikh Bureik were \"ruthlessly destroyed\" by the Turkish Army for use as rail fuel.\n\nThe October 1922 census of Palestine recorded Sheikh Abreik with a population of 111 Muslims. At some time during the early 1920s, the Sursuk family sold the lands of the village to the Jewish National Fund, via Yehoshua Hankin, a Zionist activist who was responsible for most of the major land purchases of the World Zionist Organization in Ottoman Palestine. After the sale, which included lands from the Arab villages of Harithiya, Sheikh Abreik and Harbaj, a total of 59 Arab tenants were evicted from the three villages, with 3,314 pounds compensation paid. In 1925 an agricultural settlement also named Sheikh Abreik was established by the Hapoel HaMizrachi, a Zionist political party and settlement movement.\n\nThe archaeological importance of the site was recognized in the 1880s by the Survey of Western Palestine, which explored many tombs and catacombs but did no excavation. The Arab Palestinian village of Sheikh Bureik was located on the hill until the 1920s, when the land was purchased by the Jewish National Fund. In 1936, Alexander Zaïd, employed by the JNF as a watchman, reported that he had found a breach in the wall of one of the caves which led into another cave decorated with inscriptions. In the 1930s and 1950s, the site was excavated by Benjamin Mazar and Nahman Avigad.\n\nMost of the remains date from the 2nd to 4th century CE. A large number of individuals were buried in the more than twenty catacombs of the necropolis. Geographical references in inscriptions on the walls of the catacombs reveal that the necropolis was used by people from the town of Beit She'arim, from elsewhere in Galilee, and even from cities as far away as Palmyra and Tyre.\n\nAside from an extensive body of inscriptions in several languages, the walls and tombs have many images, engraved and carved in relief, ranging from Jewish symbols and geometric decoration to animals and figures from Hellenistic myth and religion.\n\nIn October 2009, two new caves were opened to the public whose burial vaults date to the first two centuries CE.\n\nThe Jerusalem Talmud cites Beit She'arim as the burial place of Rabbi Judah the Prince, Yehuda HaNasi in Hebrew. His funeral is described as follows: \"Miracles were wrought on that day. It was evening and all the towns gathered to mourn him, and eighteen synagogues praised him and bore him to Bet Shearim, and the daylight remained until everyone reached his home (Ketubot 12, 35a).\" The fact that Rabbi Judah was buried here is believed to be a major reason for the popularity of the necropolis in Late Antiquity. The catacomb No. 14 is likely to have belonged to the family of Rabbi Judah the Prince. A clear inscription stating the name and title of Rabbi Judah the Prince in that catacomb identifies it as his burial site. A Hebrew wall inscription from Catacomb 14 reads \"Simon [Shimon] my son shall be hakham [president of the Sanhedrin], Gamaliel my son patriarch, Hanania bar Hama shall preside over the great court\", in reference to Rabbi Judah's sons Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Gamliel, and to his student, Rabbi Hanina bar Hama. Two tombs located next to each other within the same catacomb are identified by bilingual Hebrew and Greek inscriptions as those of \"R. Gamliel\" and \"R. Shimon\", believed to refer to Judah's sons, the \"nasi\" Gamaliel III and the \"hakham\" Rabbi Shimon.\n\nIn 1937, Benjamin Mazar revealed at Beit She'arim a system of tombs belonging to the Jews of Himyar (now Yemen) dating back to the 3rd century CE. The strength of ties between Yemenite Jewry and the Land of Israel can be learnt by the system of tombs at Beit She'arim dating back to the 3rd century. It is of great significance that Jews from Ḥimyar were being brought for interment in what was then considered a prestigious place, near the catacombs of the Sanhedrin. Those who had the financial means brought their dead to be buried in the Land of Israel, as it was considered an outstanding virtue for Jews not to be buried in foreign lands, but rather in the land of their forefathers. It is speculated that the Ḥimyarites, during their lifetime, were known and respected in the eyes of those who dwelt in the Land of Israel, seeing that one of them, whose name was Menaḥem, was coined the epithet \"qyl ḥmyr\" [prince of Ḥimyar], in the eight-character Ḥimyari ligature, while in the Greek inscription he was called \"Menae presbyteros\" (Menaḥem, the community's elder). The name of a woman written in Greek in its genitive form, Ενλογιαζ, is also engraved there, meaning either 'virtue', 'blessing', or 'gratis'; however, its precise transcription remains of scholarly dispute.\n\nIn 1956, a bulldozer working at the site unearthed an enormous rectangular slab, 11×6.5×1.5 feet, weighing 9 tons. Initially, it was paved over, but it was eventually studied and found to be a gigantic piece of glass. A glassmaking furnace was located here in the 9th century during the Abbasid period, which produced great batches of molten glass that were cooled and later broken into small pieces for crafting glass vessels.\n\nAn elegy written in Arabic script typical of the 9-10th century and containing the date AH 287 or 289 (AD 900 or 902) was found in the \"Magharat al-Jahannam\" (\"Cave of Hell\") catacomb during excavations conducted there in 1956. The sophisticated and beautifully worded elegy was composed by the previously unknown poet Umm al-Qasim, whose name is given in acrostic in the poem, and it can be read in Moshe Sharon's book or here on Wikipedia.\n\nMoshe Sharon speculates that this poem might be marking the beginning of the practice of treating this site as the sanctuary of Sheikh Ibreik and suggests the site was used for burial at this time and possibly later as well. He further notes that the cave within which the inscription was found forms part of a vast area of ancient ruins which constituted a natural place for the emergence of a local shrine. Drawing on the work of Tawfiq Canaan, Sharon cites his observation that 32% of the sacred sites he visited in Palestine were located in the vicinity of ancient ruins.\n\nThe excavations at the site were resumed by Adi Erlich, on behalf of the Zinman Institute of Archaeology, The University of Haifa. Erlich is focusing her excavation on the hilltop above the necropolis, where the ancient town had existed.\n\n\n"}

Bhils are also settled in the Tharparkar District of Sindh, Pakistan. They speak the Bhil languages, a subgroup of the Western Zone of the Indo-Aryan languages. As of 2013, Bhils were the largest tribal group in India.\n\nBhils are listed as indigenous people of the states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan - all in the western Deccan regions and central India - as well as in Tripura in far-eastern India, on the border with Bangladesh. Bhils are divided into a number of endogamous territorial divisions, which in turn have a number of clans and lineages. Most Bhils now speak the language of the region they reside in, such as Marathi, Gujarati or a Hindustani dialect.\n\nIn Azamgarh and Jaunpur, the Bhil are now mainly a community of settled farmers, with a significant minority who are landless agricultural labourers. A significant subsidiary occupation remains hunting and gathering. The Bhil are now largely Hindu, with Nirdhi following Islam, and few sub-groups in the Dangs following Christianity. They continue to worship tribal deities such as Dev Mogra Mata and Sitla Mata.\n\nThe Bhil are classified as a Scheduled Tribe in Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Tripura under the Indian government's reservation program of positive discrimination.\n\nThe Bhil are divided into a number of endogamous territorial divisions, which in turn have a number of clans and lineages. The main divisions in Gujarat are the Barda, Dungri Garasia, and Vasava, while in Maharashtra, the Bhil Mavchi and Kotwal are their main sub-groups.\n\nIn Rajasthan, they exist as Bhil Garasia, Dholi Bhil, Dungri Bhil, Dungri Garasia, Mewasi Bhil, Rawal Bhil, Tadvi Bhil, Bhagalia, Bhilala, Pawra, Vasava and Vasave.\n\nThe language commonly spoken by Bhils throughout their geographic distribution is Bhili. Bhili has about up to 36 identified dialects and pronunciation differs by region. Bhili is based on Gujarati, but dialects of Bhili gradually merge into more widely-spoken languages such as Marathi in the southeast and Rajasthani in the northwest.\n\nEstimates of individuals speaking the language are often inaccurate as speakers of minor languages like Bhili have sometimes been treated as having major languages (such as Marathi or Gujarati) as their mother tongue.\n\nBhils have rich and unique culture. The Bhilala sub-division is known for its Pithora painting. Ghoomar is a traditional folk dance of Bhil tribe.\nMain foods of Bhils are maize, onion, garlic and Chilli which they cultivate in their small fields. The vegitables and fruits collected by them from forests. Wheat and rice are used at time of festivals and other special occasions only. They keep self-made bows and arrow, sword, Knife, axe etc with them as weapon for self-protection and hunting the wild fauna which also form the major part of their diet. They profusely use alcohol distilled by them from the flower of Mahua(Madhuca longifolia). On festive occasions various special preparation from the dish rich, i.e Makka, genhu, lapsi, kasar and chawal etc. Bhils are traditionally non-vegetarian. They eat the meat of Goat, Chicken, Fish, Bull, Deer etc.\n\nEvery village has its own local deity (Gramdev) and families too have their Jatidev, Kuldev and Kuldevi(house hold deity) which symbolised by stones. 'Bhati dev' and 'Bhilat dev' are their serpent-god. 'Baba dev' is their village god. Karkulia dev is their crop god, Gopal dev is their pastoral god, Bag dev is their Lion god, Bhairav dev is their dog god. Some of their other gods are Indel dev, Bada dev, Mahadevel, Tejaji, Lotha mai, Techma, Orka Chichma and Kajal dev. A number of Hindu deities have now also been worshipped by them, viz. Hanuman, Shri Rama, Krishna, Shiva, Laxmi, Ganesh, Kuber, Indra and Durga. \n\nThey have much faith in magico-religious beliefs and Bhopas for their physical, mental and psycological treatements. \n\nThere are a number of festivals, viz. Rakhi, Navratri, Dashera, Diwali, Holi which celebrated by the Bhils. They also celebrate some traditional festivals viz. Akhatij, Navmi, Howan Mata ki Chalavani, Sawan Mata ki jatar, Diwasa, Nawai, Bhagoria, Gal, Gar, Dhobi, Sanja, Indel, Doha etc with ceremonious zeal and ethusiasm. \n\nDuring some festivals there are a number of tribal fairs held at different places of districts.

{"id": "970458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=970458", "title": "Book discussion club", "text": "Book discussion club\n\nA book club is a group of people who meet to discuss a book or books that they have read and express their opinions, likes, dislikes, etc. It is more often called simply a book club, a term that is also used to describe a book sales club, which can cause confusion. Other frequently used terms to describe a book discussion club include reading group, book group, and book discussion group. Book discussion clubs may meet in private homes, libraries, bookstores, online forums, pubs, and in cafés or restaurants over meals or drinks.\n\nA practice also associated with book discussion, common reading program or common read, involves institutions encouraging their members to discuss select books in group settings; common reading programs are largely associated with educational institutions encouraging their students to hold book discussion meetings.\n\nA single-title club is one in which people discuss a particular title that every person in the group has read at the same time, often with each member buying a personal copy. Clearly, the club must somehow decide ahead of time what that title will be. Some groups may decide to choose new release titles, whilst others may choose older ones, or a mixture of the two. If it is a book discussion club that meets at a library, then each member may borrow a copy of the book from the library over a given timeframe in order for a later discussion.\n\nThere may be a few problems with these clubs. Some members may regard them as opportunities to meet people for social contact and general conversation, partially veering off onto a wide variety of non-literary topics, while others wish to engage in serious literary analysis focused on the book in question and related works, with little non-literary interaction. Additionally, some members may suggest a book not because they are interested in it from a literary point-of-view but because they think it will offer them an opportunity to make points of personal interest to them or fit an external agenda. Also, different expectations and education/skill levels may lead to conflicts and disappointments in clubs of this kind.\n\nThe characteristics of a multi-title club are such that each member may be reading different titles from each other at any given time, and they may share a reading list for a period of time. What distinguishes this from any group of unrelated people reading different things from each other is that each title is expected to be read by the next member in a serial fashion.\n\nOpen loans suggest that the books in question are free to be loaned among the population with the expectation of getting them back eventually. Instead of one member deciding what everyone will read, with all the cost implications of acquiring that title, these clubs usually involve circulating books they already own. Each book is introduced with a short precis. This offers members the advantage of previewing a work before committing to read. It has the effect of narrowing the focus of the dialogue so that book and reader are more quickly and more accurately matched up. The sequential nature of the process implies that within a short time, three to five people may have read the same title, which is the perfect amount for a worthy conversation.\n\nCatch and release imply that actual ownership of the book transfers each iteration with no expectation of the book returning to the original owner. The mechanism of transfer may include a personal face to face hand off, sending the items through the mail, or most remarkably, leaving the book in a public place with the expectation that unknown future readers will find it there. All three methods are utilized with BookCrossing. Participants use a website and a system of unique identification numbers to track released items as they migrate through a worldwide community. The interaction is largely web-centric, but it does not exclude face-to-face gatherings, each of which can take on the traits of other book discussion clubs.\n\nMany public libraries lead book clubs as a library program on a regular basis. A librarian usually leads a discussion after participants read the book. Copies of the book are available to either be checked out or signed out for the group meeting. If leading a book discussion group outside of the facility, often libraries offer book discussion kits where several titles of a book are able to be loaned out of the library to a single patron. Also, the lending period is typically longer than for the average book. The kits also contains a suggested reading guide with discussion questions. This is a convenience as everyone in the group is not forced to buy a copy of the book.\n\nLibrarians also aid in the procurement of items needed for private book club meetings. They are able to withhold multiple copies of a publication and extend loan periods. They are also able to facilitate club meetings digitally, through discussion boards or video meetings. Many librarians note the positive influence of Google+ hangouts and Skype to host meetings for long distance club members and for times in which all members could not attend the club. Librarians have helped non-traditional book clubs find footing within their community.\n\nWith the challenge that not all members of a club can regularly meet at an appointed place and time, a new form of book clubs has emerged online. Online clubs exist in the shape of Internet forums, Yahoo Groups, e-mail mailing lists, dedicated websites, such as Goodreads.com, apps such as Novellic and even telephone conference calls. Also, in the category of social networks, these online clubs are made up of members of a variety of reading interests and often approach book discussion in different ways, e.g. academic discussion, pleasure-reading discussion, personal connection, and reaction to books members read.\n\nIn 2012, a new book club format referred to as author-led book clubs was introduced by Business Book Club \"12 Books.\" Author led book clubs include the author of the current book as part of the discussion; it often concludes the discussion with a live conference call or webinar.\n\nA broadcast club is one in which a television, radio, or podcast show features a regular segment that presents a discussion of a book. The segment is announced in advance so that viewers or listeners may read the book prior to the broadcast discussion. Some notable broadcast book discussion clubs include:\n\n\nGiven the busy lifestyles of today, another variation on the traditional 'book club' is the book reading club. In such a club, the group agrees on a specific book, and each week (or whatever frequency), one person in the group reads the book out loud while the rest of the group listens. The group can either allow interruptions for comments and questions from the members at any time, or agree to allow such input at chapter or section endings. Such a club makes reading a shared experience and frees the busy members from the \"homework\" of having read the book before coming to the club. It also creates a lively environment for commenting on the specifics of the books as it is read and can lead to very enriching exchanges. A given book may continue for several sittings, depending on the pace of reading, frequency of meetings, and the extent of comments and discussion. Members can take turns reading to share the reading responsibility. Another variation on the concept could be jointly listening to an audio-book with pauses for comments. Once a book is completed, members recommend their choices of the new books and vote on which book to proceed with next.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Note that the results for silver and grey may be affected by discrepancies in how the companies classify these colours.\n\nSilver is a popular colour for rental vehicles. Cars that are silver retain their value better than any other colour, reselling for around 10% more than white cars; this superior resale value has caused many UK police agencies to replace their standard white patrol cars with silver models.\n\nA common belief is that red cars cost more to insure; in fact, insurers do not take colour into account.\n\nColour choice is subject to fluctuation and fashion, and historical trends shifted from dark neutral colours of early cars, through more vivid colours of 1950s and 1960s, back towards today's greyscale colours.\n\nA 2013 survey in the United States found that men were 12% more likely to prefer a red car, while women were 9% more likely to prefer silver.

Chromotherapists claim to be able to use light in the form of color to balance \"energy\" lacking from a person's body, whether it be on physical, emotional, spiritual, or mental levels.\n\nColor therapy is distinct from other types of light therapy, such as neonatal jaundice treatment and blood irradiation therapy which is a scientifically accepted medical treatment for a number of conditions, and from photobiology, the scientific study of the effects of light on living organisms. The potential risk of retinal damage linked to chromotherapy has been discussed by French skeptic and lighting physicist Sébastien Point. Although Point considers that LED lamps at domestic radiance are safe in normal use for the general population, \nhe also pointed out the risk of overexposure to light from LEDs for practices like chromotherapy, when duration and time exposure are not under control. \n\nAvicenna (980–1037), seeing color as of vital importance both in diagnosis and in treatment, discussed chromotherapy in \"The Canon of Medicine\". He wrote that \"color is an observable symptom of disease\" and also developed a chart that related color to the temperature and physical condition of the body. His view was that red moved the blood, blue or white cooled it, and yellow reduced muscular pain and inflammation.\n\nAmerican Civil War General Augustus Pleasonton (1801–1894) conducted his own experiments and in 1876 published his book \"The Influence Of The Blue Ray Of The Sunlight And Of The Blue Color Of The Sky\" about how the color blue can improve the growth of crops and livestock and can help heal diseases in humans. This led to modern chromotherapy, influencing scientist Dr. Seth Pancoast (1823–1889) and Edwin Dwight Babbitt (1828–1905) to conduct experiments and to publish, respectively, \"Blue and Red Light; or, Light and Its Rays as Medicine\" (1877) and \"The Principles of Light and Color\".\n\nIn 1933, Indian-born American-citizen scientist Dinshah P. Ghadiali (1873–1966), published \"The Spectro Chromemetry Encyclopaedia\", a work on color therapy. Ghadiali claimed to have discovered why and how the different colored rays have various therapeutic effects on organisms. He believed that colors represent chemical potencies in higher octaves of vibration, and for each organism and system of the body there is a particular color that stimulates and another that inhibits the work of that organ or system. Ghadiali also thought that by knowing the action of the different colors upon the different organs and systems of the body, one can apply the correct color that will tend to balance the action of any organ or system that has become abnormal in its functioning or condition. Dinshah P. Ghadiali's son Darius Dinshah continues to provide information about color therapy via his Dinshah Health Society, a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing non-pharmaceutical home color therapy, and his book \"Let There Be Light\".\n\nScience writer Martin Gardner had described Ghadiali as \"perhaps the greatest quack of them all\". In 1925, Ghadiali was accused of rape and arrested in Seattle and sentenced under the Mann Act for five years at the United States Penitentiary, Atlanta. According to Gardner, photographs of Ghadiali at work in his laboratory are \"indistinguishable from stills of a grade D movie about a mad scientist\".\n\nThroughout the 19th century \"color healers\" claimed colored glass filters could treat many diseases including constipation and meningitis.\n\nPractitioners of ayurvedic medicine believe the body has seven \"chakras\", which some claim are 'spiritual centers', and which are held to be located along the spine. New Age thought associates each of the chakras with a single color of the visible light spectrum, along with a function and organ or bodily system. According to this view, the chakras can become imbalanced and result in physical diseases, but application of the appropriate color can allegedly correct such imbalances. The purported colors and their associations are described as:\n\nChromotherapy is regarded by health experts as quackery.\n\nAccording to a book published by the American Cancer Society, \"available scientific evidence does not support claims that alternative uses of light or color therapy are effective in treating cancer or other illnesses\".\n\nPhotobiology, the term for the scientific study of the effects of light on living tissue, has sometimes been used instead of the term chromotherapy in an effort to distance it from its roots in Victorian mysticism and to strip it of its associations with symbolism and magic. Light therapy is a specific treatment approach using high intensity light to treat specific sleep, skin and mood disorders.\n\n\n"}

Like the majority of state symbols for states with Malay royalties, the flag and the arms of Terengganu centre on its royalty, as well as Islam, the state's traditional religion.\n\nFirst revealed in 1953, the present flag of Terengganu encompasses a black flag with a thick, white border and a white star and crescent in the centre that points towards the fly. The width of the crescent is five-sixths the width of the black panel, while the width of the star, which is tilting clockwise, is two-thirds that of the crescent.\n\nThe white signifies the Sultan of Terengganu, while the black signifies the state's citizens; with the white border surrounding the black panel, the layout represents the Sultan's duty to protect his subjects. The star and crescent denote Islam as the official religion of the state.\n\nIn October 2006, then-\"Menteri Besar\" of Terengganu Idris Jusoh voiced intentions by the state government to \"[brighten] up\" the flag and incorporate an emblem by first seeking opinions from professions, citing feedback of the flag being too \"simple and dull\". As of 2008, there have been no reports of further action.\n\nTerengganu has eight administrative districts (\"daerah\"), each assigned their own district-level flags. All eight of the flags consist of only a single coloured field with the state flag on the canton; the only distinction is the colour of the field, which corresponds to respectable districts and represents their qualities:\n\nTerengganu's royalty, mostly prominently the Sultan of Terengganu, fly their own Royal Standards.\n\nThe Sultan's Royal Standard is known as \"Tanah Putih\" and consists of a white flag bearing a partial rendition of the state emblem, as well as a wreath of rice stalks and a motto. Previously a plain white flag, the additional emblem, which is coloured yellow, was added to identify the flag to Terengganu's royal family.\n\nThe design of the \"Pemaisuri\"s (Queen's) Royal Standard (which is given the name \"Tanah Kuning Tua\") is very similar to that of the Sultan's, but features a reversed arrangement of colours, with a white emblem against a yellow field. The Royal Standard of the \"Yang Di-pertuan Muda\" (Crown Prince) bears a similar colour configuration as the Queen's, but features only the partial rendition of the state emblem, which is significantly larger than that of the Sultan's and the Queen's. The Royal Standard for the Crown Prince is named as \"Tanah Kuning Muda\".\n\nPrior to the adoption of the present flag, the state flag of Terengganu previously sported a significantly different design, although many of its elements would be carried over to its successor. The earliest known variant of the state flag was used between 1925 and 1933, and consisted of only a white-black flag divided vertically with the black stripe two times wider than the white stripe.\n\nIn 1933, a star and crescent that pointed upwards and featured rounder crescent was added on the black band, signifying Terengganu's recognition of Islam as the state's religion. The flag remained in use until the introduction of the current flag.\n\nAdditionally, the state government of Terengganu formerly flew its own \"Governmental Service Flag\", which design originated in the same manner as the state flag. Bearing the same vertical white-black layout, a white saltire was also included on the black stripe. Similarly, a star and crescent was also added in a later date, but was placed on the white stripe. The flag was rendered obsolete following the adoption of the present state flag, which was also to be used by the state government.\n\nApproved for official use by the State Ministers Committee in 1932, the state arms or emblem (Malay: \"Jata\") of Terengganu was designed by several state officials during the reign of Sultan Zainal Abidin III (1881–1918), and is thought to have been drawn by Mohamad bin Abdul Rahim, the relative of Dato' Nara Wangsa (Dato' Mata-Mata).\n\nThe arms originally consisted of a white outlined oval that encompassed a series of symbols coloured in yellow and a Jawi motto. During the rule of Sultan Ismail Nasiruddin Shah (1945–1979), the emblem was modified with the addition of a dotted figure of a seal around all of the symbols except the star and crescent, which resides over the seal, the addition of a pair of maces and the shortening of the motto.\n\nDetails of the emblem's components are as follows:\n\n\n\nThe motto, \"Terengganu\" written in Jawi (ترڠڬانو), is located below the seal. When introduced in 1932, the emblem's motto originally read \"Jawatan Kerajaan Terengganu\" (Terengganu Government Post) in Jawi. During the rule of Sultan Ismail Nasiruddin Shah, \"Jawatan Kerajaan\" was omitted from the motto, resulting in its present form.\n\nThe state emblem of Terengganu is included on the Royal Standards of Terengganu's royal family, but differs slightly, as it is only duplicated partially, without the outlining oval border and seal, the \"Terengganu\" motto and the star and crescent. Two elements are added on the emblem in the case of the Royal Standards for the Sultan and the Queen: a wreath of rice stalks and a different motto depicted in the form of banner to be written in Jawi. The motto corresponds to the individual the Standard is assigned to; as such, the motto for the Standard of the Sultan reads \"\"Sultan Terengganu\" while that of the Queen reads \"Pemaisuri Terengganu\"\". The emblem on the Royal Standard of the Crown Prince consists of only the partial replication of the state emblem.\n\nAs the Standard of the Sultan has a white field, the emblem retains its yellow colour. However, as the Standard of the Queen and the Crown Prince bare yellow fields, their emblems are white.\n"}

{"id": "11241058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11241058", "title": "Intellectual property brokering", "text": "Intellectual property brokering\n\nAn intellectual property broker mediates between the buyer and seller of intellectual property (IP) and may manage the many steps in the process of creating a deal with regard to the purchase, sale, license, or marketing of intellectual property assets. This may include: patents, trademarks, or inventions (prototypes).\n\nInventors are faced with several alternatives to making their invention a commercial success. They can build their own start up company from scratch using their own resources. In the United States, they can seek government grants; SBIR (Small Business Innovative Research) and (TTR) Technology Transfer Research to fund the early stage development of their technology. They can contract with third parties such as: venture capital or angel investors to finance a startup or they can sell or license their products to an existing and established company. Often inventors are interested in expanding their own intellectual property assets through licensing and acquisitions.\n\nBecause there is not a well defined market around the buying and selling of patents or other IP assets, if an inventor or patent owner wants to monetize their asset, an intellectual property broker can help by serving to connect the inventor or patent owner with one or more interested buyers. The broker should have a network of connections in various market segments which can be used to help market the patent being sold. Potential buyers may include industry peers, competitors, entrepreneurs looking to commercialize the technology, but also defensive patent aggregators, and patent licensing companies.\n\nA competent broker should be able to explain to the inventor or patent owner the spectrum of values that may be assessed to a patent depending on the situation or motivation of the buyer in the market. In addition, in bringing buyers and sellers together, an intellectual property broker may provide any or all of the following services:\n\n\nThe estimated number of patent brokers varies greatly. For example, a 1999 World Intellectual Property Organization WIPO paper estimated 500 \"patent brokers\" in the United States in. However, an October 2015 listing of patent brokerage companies includes only about 57 businesses worldwide. As none of these firms have a large number of employees, the 1999 estimates are either wrong as the number of businesses operating as patent brokers does not match the 1999 patent brokers estimates, or there has been a significant decline in the market for patent brokerage. Further research is required to estimate the number of patent brokers.\n\nThe estimated size of the brokered patent market was $165 million in 2016, down from $233 million in 2015. It was estimated that of all the brokered patent packages brought to market only 21% of them sell. Average asking price per patent asset was $197K in 2016. 137 people were estimated to be employed in the brokered patent market. \n\n"}
{"id": "1365652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1365652", "title": "International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "text": "International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights\n\nThe International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) is a multilateral treaty adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 16 December 1966 through GA. Resolution 2200A (XXI), and came in force from 3 January 1976. It commits its parties to work toward the granting of economic, social, and cultural rights (ESCR) to the Non-Self-Governing and Trust Territories and individuals, including labour rights and the right to health, the right to education, and the right to an adequate standard of living. As of September 2018, the Covenant has 169 parties. A further four countries, including the United States, have signed but not ratified the Covenant.\n\nThe ICESCR (and its Optional Protocol) is part of the International Bill of Human Rights, along with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), including the latter's first and second Optional Protocols.\n\nThe Covenant is monitored by the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.\n\nThe ICESCR has its roots in the same process that led to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. A \"Declaration on the Essential Rights of Man\" had been proposed at the 1945 San Francisco Conference which led to the founding of the United Nations, and the Economic and Social Council was given the task of drafting it. Early on in the process, the document was split into a declaration setting forth general principles of human rights, and a convention or covenant containing binding commitments. The former evolved into the UDHR and was adopted on 10 December 1948.\n\nDrafting continued on the convention, but there remained significant differences between UN members on the relative importance of negative civil and political versus positive economic, social and cultural rights. These eventually caused the convention to be split into two separate covenants, \"one to contain civil and political rights and the other to contain economic, social and cultural rights.\" The two covenants were to contain as many similar provisions as possible, and be opened for signature simultaneously. Each would also contain an article on the right of all peoples to self-determination.\n\nThe States Parties to the present Covenant, including those having responsibility for the administration of Non-Self-Governing and Trust Territories, shall promote the realization of the right of self-determination, and shall respect that right, in conformity with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.\n\nThe first document became the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the second the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The drafts were presented to the UN General Assembly for discussion in 1954, and adopted in 1966.\n\nThe Covenant follows the structure of the UDHR and the ICCPR, with a preamble and thirty-one articles, divided into five parts.\n\nPart 1 (Article 1) recognises the right of all peoples to self-determination, including the right to \"freely determine their political status\", pursue their economic, social and cultural goals, and manage and dispose of their own resources. It recognises a negative right of a people not to be deprived of its means of subsistence, and imposes an obligation on those parties still responsible for non-self governing and trust territories (colonies) to encourage and respect their self-determination.\n\nPart 2 (Articles 2–5) establishes the principle of \"progressive realisation\" – see below. It also requires the rights be recognised \"without discrimination of any kind as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status\". The rights can only be limited by law, in a manner compatible with the nature of the rights, and only for the purpose of \"promoting the general welfare in a democratic society\".\n\nPart 3 (Articles 6–15) lists the rights themselves. These include rights to\n\nMany of these rights include specific actions which must be undertaken to realise them.\n\nPart 4 (Articles 16–25) governs reporting and monitoring of the Covenant and the steps taken by the parties to implement it. It also allows the monitoring body – originally the United Nations Economic and Social Council – now the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights – see below – to make general recommendations to the UN General Assembly on appropriate measures to realise the rights (Article 21)\n\nPart 5 (Articles 26–31) governs ratification, entry into force, and amendment of the Covenant.\n\nArticle 2 of the Covenant imposes a duty on all parties to\n\ntake steps... to the maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the present Covenant by all appropriate means, including particularly the adoption of legislative measures.\n\nThis is known as the principle of \"progressive realisation\". It acknowledges that some of the rights (for example, the right to health) may be difficult in practice to achieve in a short period of time, and that states may be subject to resource constraints, but requires them to act as best they can within their means.\n\nThe principle differs from that of the ICCPR, which obliges parties to \"respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction\" the rights in that Convention. However, it does not render the Covenant meaningless. The requirement to \"take steps\" imposes a continuing obligation to work towards the realisation of the rights. It also rules out deliberately regressive measures which impede that goal. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights also interprets the principle as imposing minimum core obligations to provide, at the least, minimum essential levels of each of the rights. If resources are highly constrained, this should include the use of targeted programmes aimed at the vulnerable.\n\nThe Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights regards legislation as an indispensable means for realising the rights which is unlikely to be limited by resource constraints. The enacting of anti-discrimination provisions and the establishment of enforceable rights with judicial remedies within national legal systems are considered to be appropriate means. Some provisions, such as anti-discrimination laws, are already required under other human rights instruments, such as the ICCPR.\n\nArticle 6 of the Covenant recognises the right to work, defined as the opportunity of everyone to gain their living by freely chosen or accepted work. Parties are required to take \"appropriate steps\" to safeguard this right, including technical and vocational training and economic policies aimed at steady economic development and ultimately full employment. The right implies parties must guarantee equal access to employment and protect workers from being unfairly deprived of employment. They must prevent discrimination in the workplace and ensure access for the disadvantaged. The fact that work must be freely chosen or accepted means parties must prohibit forced or child labor.\n\nThe work referred to in Article 6 must be \"decent work\". This is effectively defined by Article 7 of the Covenant, which recognises the right of everyone to \"just and favourable\" working conditions. These are in turn defined as fair wages with equal pay for equal work, sufficient to provide a decent living for workers and their dependants; safe working conditions; equal opportunity in the workplace; and sufficient rest and leisure, including limited working hours and regular, paid holidays.\n\nArticle 8 recognises the right of workers to form or join trade unions and protects the right to strike. It allows these rights to be restricted for members of the armed forces, police, or government administrators. Several parties have placed reservations on this clause, allowing it to be interpreted in a manner consistent with their constitutions (e.g., China, Mexico), or extending the restriction of union rights to groups such as firefighters (e.g., Japan).\n\nArticle 9 of the Covenant recognizes \"the right of everyone to social security, including social insurance\". It requires parties to provide some form of social insurance scheme to protect people against the risks of sickness, disability, maternity, employment injury, unemployment or old age; to provide for survivors, orphans, and those who cannot afford health care; and to ensure that families are adequately supported. Benefits from such a scheme must be adequate, accessible to all, and provided without discrimination. The Covenant does not restrict the form of the scheme, and both contributory and non-contributory schemes are permissible (as are community-based and mutual schemes).\n\nThe Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has noted persistent problems with the implementation of this right, with very low levels of access.\n\nSeveral parties, including France and Monaco, have reservations allowing them to set residence requirements in order to qualify for social benefits. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights permits such restrictions, provided they are proportionate and reasonable.\n\nArticle 10 of the Covenant recognises the family as \"the natural and fundamental group unit of society\", and requires parties to accord it \"the widest possible protection and assistance\". Parties must ensure that their citizens are free to establish families and that marriages are freely contracted and not forced. Parties must also provide paid leave or adequate social security to mothers before and after childbirth, an obligation which overlaps with that of Article 9. Finally, parties must take \"special measures\" to protect children from economic or social exploitation, including setting a minimum age of employment and barring children from dangerous and harmful occupations.\n\nArticle 11 recognises the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living. This includes, but is not limited to, the right to adequate food, clothing, housing, and \"the continuous improvement of living conditions\". It also creates an obligation on parties to work together to eliminate world hunger.\n\nThe right to adequate food, also referred to as the right to food, is interpreted as requiring \"the availability of food in a quantity and quality sufficient to satisfy the dietary needs of individuals, free from adverse substances, and acceptable within a given culture\". This must be accessible to all, implying an obligation to provide special programmes for the vulnerable. This must also ensure an equitable distribution of world food supplies in relation to need, taking into account the problems of food-importing and food-exporting countries. The right to adequate food also implies a right to water.\n\nThe right to adequate housing, also referred to as the right to housing, is \"the right to live somewhere in security, peace and dignity\". It requires \"adequate privacy, adequate space, adequate security, adequate lighting and ventilation, adequate basic infrastructure and adequate location with regard to work and basic facilities – all at a reasonable cost\". Parties must ensure security of tenure and that access is free of discrimination, and progressively work to eliminate homelessness. Forced evictions, defined as \"the permanent or temporary removal against their will of individuals, families and/or communities from the homes and/or land which they occupy, without the provision of, and access to, appropriate forms of legal or other protection\", are a prima facie violation of the Covenant.\n\nThe right to adequate clothing, also referred to as the right to clothing, has not been authoritatively defined and has received little in the way of academic commentary or international discussion. What is considered \"adequate\" has only been discussed in specific contexts, such as refugees, the disabled, the elderly, or workers.\n\nArticle 12 of the Covenant recognises the right of everyone to \"the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health\". \"Health\" is understood not just as a right to be healthy, but as a right to control one's own health and body (including reproduction), and be free from interference such as torture or medical experimentation. States must protect this right by ensuring that everyone within their jurisdiction has access to the underlying determinants of health, such as clean water, sanitation, food, nutrition and housing, and through a comprehensive system of healthcare, which is available to everyone without discrimination, and economically accessible to all.\n\nArticle 12.2 requires parties to take specific steps to improve the health of their citizens, including reducing infant mortality and improving child health, improving environmental and workplace health, preventing, controlling and treating epidemic diseases, and creating conditions to ensure equal and timely access to medical services for all. These are considered to be \"illustrative, non-exhaustive examples\", rather than a complete statement of parties' obligations.\n\nThe right to health is interpreted as requiring parties to respect women's' reproductive rights, by not limiting access to contraception or \"censoring, withholding or intentionally misrepresenting\" information about sexual health. They must also ensure that women are protected from harmful traditional practices such as female genital mutilation.\n\nRight to health is inclusive right extending not only to timely and appropriate health care but also to the underlying determinants of health, such as access to safe and potable water and adequate sanitation, an adequate supply of safe food, nutrition and housing, healthy occupational and environmental conditions.\n\nArticle 13 of the Covenant recognises the right of everyone to free education (free for the primary level and \"the progressive introduction of free education\" for the secondary and higher levels). This is to be directed towards \"the full development of the human personality and the sense of its dignity\", and enable all persons to participate effectively in society. Education is seen both as a human right and as \"an indispensable means of realizing other human rights\", and so this is one of the longest and most important articles of the Covenant.\n\nArticle 13.2 lists a number of specific steps parties are required to pursue to realise the right of education. These include the provision of free, universal and compulsory primary education, \"generally available and accessible\" secondary education in various forms (including technical and vocational training), and equally accessible higher education. All of these must be available to all without discrimination. Parties must also develop a school system (though it may be public, private, or mixed), encourage or provide scholarships for disadvantaged groups. Parties are required to make education free at all levels, either immediately or progressively; \"[p]rimary education shall be compulsory and available free to all\"; secondary education \"shall be made generally available and accessible to all by every appropriate means, and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education\"; and \"[h]igher education shall be made equally accessible to all, on the basis of capacity, by every appropriate means, and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education\".\n\nArticles 13.3 and 13.4 require parties to respect the educational freedom of parents by allowing them to choose and establish private educational institutions for their children, also referred to as freedom of education. It also recognises the right of parents to \"ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions\". This is interpreted as requiring public schools to respect the freedom of religion and conscience of their students, and as forbidding instruction in a particular religion or belief system unless non-discriminatory exemptions and alternatives are available.\n\nThe Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights interpret the Covenant as also requiring states to respect the academic freedom of staff and students, as this is vital for the educational process. It also considers corporal punishment in schools to be inconsistent with the Covenant's underlying principle of the dignity of the individual.\n\nArticle 14 of the Covenant requires those parties which have not yet established a system of free compulsory primary education, to rapidly adopt a detailed plan of action for its introduction \"within a reasonable number of years\".\n\nArticle 15 of the Covenant recognises the right of everyone to participate in cultural life, enjoy the benefits of scientific progress, and to benefit from the protection of the moral and material rights to any scientific discovery or artistic work they have created. The latter clause is sometimes seen as requiring the protection of intellectual property, but the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights interprets it as primarily protecting the moral rights of authors and \"proclaim[ing] the intrinsically personal character of every creation of the human mind and the ensuing durable link between creators and their creations\". It thus requires parties to respect the right of authors to be recognised as the creator of a work.

For political reasons, the Carter administration did not push for the necessary review of the Covenant by the Senate, which must give its 'advice and consent' before the US can ratify a treaty. The Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations took the view that economic, social, and cultural rights were not really rights but merely desirable social goals and therefore should not be the object of binding treaties. The Clinton Administration did not deny the nature of these rights but did not find it politically expedient to engage in a battle with Congress over the Covenant. The George W. Bush administration followed in line with the view of the previous Bush administration.\" The Obama Administration stated \"The Administration does not seek action at this time\" on the Covenant.

It was opened for signature on 24 September 2009, and as of February 2013 has been signed by 40 parties and ratified by 22. Having passed the threshold of required ratifications it has entered into force on 5 May 2013.\n\nThe Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is a body of human rights experts tasked with monitoring the implementation of the Covenant. It consists of 18 independent human rights experts, elected for four-year terms, with half the members elected every two years.\n\nUnlike other human rights monitoring bodies, the Committee was not established by the treaty it oversees. Rather, it was established by the Economic and Social Council following the failure of two previous monitoring bodies.\n\nAll states parties are required to submit regular reports to the Committee outlining the legislative, judicial, policy and other measures they have taken to implement the rights affirmed in the Covenant. The first report is due within two years of ratifying the Covenant; thereafter reports are due every five years. The Committee examines each report and addresses its concerns and recommendations to the State party in the form of \"concluding observations\".\n\nThe Committee typically meets every May and November in Geneva.\n\nThe following are parties to the covenant:\n\n\n\n\n"}

She grew up in St. Louis, Missouri, spending summers at the family's summer home in Whalewalk Farm, Orleans, Massachusetts. She attended Wheeler School in Providence, Rhode Island but graduated from Mary Institute in St. Louis in 1943. Dillon earned a Bachelor of Arts from Smith College in 1947. Her husband-to-be, George Chaffee Dillon of Liberty, Missouri, had served in the Navy during the Second World War, rising to the rank of Lt. Commander, then receiving an MBA from Harvard Business School. They met in Cambridge and married on 11 September 1948. That same year the couple moved to Kansas City, Missouri where George went to work first for J. Bruening & Co. then Butler Manufacturing in 1949, eventually becoming president and chairman of the board. The Dillons had two daughters and a son. Joan Dillon went on to complete a Masters Degree in Medieval History at the University of Missouri in 1969 with a thesis on Medieval architecture. From 1962 to 1971 she taught Ancient and Medieval History at Sunset Hill School (now The Pembroke Hill School).\n\nThe Folly Theater is a historic theater in Kansas City, Missouri. It originally opened as the Standard Theater on 23 September 1900 and featured on the burlesque and vaudeville circuit. Business started declining in 1928 and the theater was closed between 1932 and 1941. The theater began showing adult movies in 1969 but continued to physically decline. The balcony had been closed by the fire marshall in 1964. The theater again closed in January 1974. The theater's then owners, Annbar Associates and Elk Realty of New York, announced that if a buyer could not be identified by the end of the year, the theater would be demolished to make way for a parking lot.\n\nA group of local historic preservation activists, including Dillon and William N. Deramus III, formed the nonprofit Performing Arts Foundation, to raise the money to purchase and restore the theater. The theater was offered for sale for $950,000. The Performing Arts Foundation raised $350,000 in contributions and through negotiation convinced Annbar Associates to offer the remaining $600,000 of the purchase price as a donation.\n\nFolly Theater was added to the in 1974.\n\nBut preventing the building from being demolished was just the beginning. The building was in a considerable state of disrepair. Most of the windows were broken. A chandelier had fallen onto the balcony. Pornographic magazines rotted in closets. Nineteen tones of pigeon dung would be removed from the building. Between 1974 and 1987 Dillon and the Performing Arts Foundation raised $5 million for the restoration of the theater, including a $1 million grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The theater was reopened in 1981. A plaque was mounted on the stage recognizing Joan Dillon's work in saving the Folly Theater. A pair of plaster pigeons installed above the box office by architect Bob Berkebile are named Joan and George after the Dillons.\n\nHer work saving and restoring the Folly Theater made Dillon a nationally known historic preservation advocate. She became a board member of the League of Historic American Theaters from 1978-1981 and 1992-1998, the National Trust for Historic Preservation from 1980-1990, President Reagan's Committee on the Arts and Humanities from 1982-1990 and the Smithsonian National Board from 1989-1995. Her board and committee work required frequent travel to Washington, D.C.\n\nFor a number of years Dillon had been thinking about a book documenting America's nineteenth century historic theaters. Through her work on historic preservation, Dillon met architectural historian David Naylor. Naylor had already produced two books on movie theaters, \"American Picture Palaces: The Architecture of Fantasy\" (1981) and \"Great American Movie Theaters\" (1987), and during the years 1994-1996 the two worked together on Dillon's idea. They began by contacting one thousand five hundred theaters by telephone and postcard. They then sent a follow-up questionnaire to more than a thousand from the first list. The two then traveled extensively with one or both Dillon and Naylor eventual visiting two hundred and fifty theaters. Eventually the two arrived upon a list of forty theaters, arranged into seven broad categories, they deemed representative of the breadth of American nineteenth century theaters (see next section for detail on their list and categories). The record of their survey, \"American Theaters: Performance Halls of the Nineteenth Century\", was published in 1997.\n\nThroughout her life Dillon continued to spend summers in Cape Cod. In 1976 she bought a home in North Chatham, Massachusetts. Dillon continued her historic preservation activities in the Cape Cod region. She worked in Acquisitions for the Cape Cod Museum of Art from 2007-2009. In 2007 she published \"Barns of Cape Cod\" with her son, Kent C. Dillon and photographer Blandon Belushin. For the last ten years of her life she lived in Cape Cod permanently and it was in her home there that Joan Dillon died at the age of 83 of leukemia and cardiac arrest on 18 January 2009.\n\nAfter a brief historical essay, the bulk of the book consists of the section, \"A Revue of Nineteenth Century American Theaters.\" From the thousands of initially identified theaters, the forty that Dillon and Naylor selected as exemplary of nineteenth century theaters are the following.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoan Dillon donated her papers relating to the production of \"American Theaters\" to the University of Maryland, College Park in April 2003. They are available as the Joan Dillon papers in the State of Maryland and Historical Collections in the Special Collections at Hornbake Library.\n"}

One of the few guidelines was that none of the people in the bands were to have played with, worked with, or had \"intimate relationships\" with one another.\n\nThe Lottery League 2008 began with a Draft Night. Shortly thereafter, the participants had 10 weeks to create and rehearse music to be performed at Cleveland music venue, The Beachland Ballroom and Tavern.

This show took place on April 12, 2008, to a crowd of several hundred people.\n\nAs part of the Lottery League 2008, each band was to submit recordings for their work. Additionally, video and photo footage of band rehearsals, interviews, and footage from the Big Show was also taken. All of these will be gathered into a special CD/DVD release, slated for Fall 2008.\n\nWhile many Lottery League groups made no plans to continue performing beyond the night of the Big Show, others have chosen to forge ahead, writing songs, booking shows, and recording more new music.\n\n"}

As Nakskov was mentioned in Valdemar's Census Book in the 13th century, the church probably dates to the same period.\n\nRemains of a wooden church from c. 1000 were unearthed in the 1950s. \nIt was replaced by a brick church dedicated to Saint Nicholas which is first mentioned in 1398 although its oldest sections probably date from the early 13th century. It was completed in the second half of the 17th century. Major repairs were carried out in 1746 but further work proved necessary in 1825. Before the Danish Reformation, the church had a series of chapels and altars, each connected with the craftsmen's guilds in the town. Much of the documentation was destroyed when the Lübeckers plundered Nakskov in 1510.\n\nBuilt of light red brick, the original chancel and nave were in the Romanesque style. Parts of these remain in the Gothic additions from the first half of the 15th century. Major extensions were added to both east and west, resulting in aisles on either side of the nave which virtually encapsulated the older construction. A large tower was also built at the west end of the former nave at the beginning of the 15th century. In the mid-17th century, after a period of some 200 years without further construction work, Gothic additions were completed. The Romanesque chancel was demolished while rectangular arches were added in the former walls. The spire which was repeatedly damaged by lightning was finally redesigned by H.C. Glahn in 1906.\n\nThe carved altarpiece in the auricular style from 1656 is the work of Anders Mortensen from Odense. The central painting of the Last Supper (which contains an image of Nakskov Church in the background) is topped by depictions of the Crucifixion and Christ's removal from the cross. There are also figures of the Evangelists and the Apostles, Christ Resurrected and also of Moses and Aaron. The pulpit, also in the Baroque auricular style, was completed by Jørgen Ringnis in 1630. It was presented to the church by Mayor Thyge Sørensen whose portrait, and that of his wife, have been included in the pulpit's decorations which also include the 12 apostles. Ringnis also designed the gallery (1631) with figures of the apostles which now stands below the organ loft. The organ was built by Johan Lorentz in 1648 and restored in 1968. On that occasion, Paul-Gerhard Andersen took pains to restore the organ's Baroque housing by Søren Ibsen.\n\n\n"}

The tale was one collected by the Brothers Grimm in the 1812 edition of \"Children's and Household Tales\". According to researchers at Durham University and the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, the story originated around 4,000 years ago.\n\nIn order to appear superior, a miller lies to the king, telling him that his daughter can spin straw into gold (some versions make the miller's daughter blonde and describe the \"straw-into-gold\" claim as a careless boast the miller makes about the way his daughter's straw-like blond hair takes on a gold-like lustre when sunshine strikes it). The king calls for the girl, shuts her in a tower room filled with straw and a spinning wheel, and demands she spin the straw into gold by morning or he will cut off her head (other versions have the king threatening to lock her up in a dungeon forever). When she has given up all hope, an imp-like creature appears in the room and spins the straw into gold in return for her necklace (since he only comes to people seeking a deal/trade). When next morning the king takes the girl to a larger room filled with straw to repeat the feat, the imp once again spins, in return for the girl's ring. On the third day, when the girl has been taken to an even larger room filled with straw and told by the king that he will marry her if she can fill this room with gold or execute her if she cannot, the girl has nothing left with which to pay the strange creature. He extracts from her a promise that she will give him her firstborn child and so he spins the straw into gold a final time (In some versions, the imp appears and begins to turn the straw into gold, paying no heed to the girl's protests that she has nothing to pay him with; when he finishes the task, he states that the price is her first child, and the horrified girl objects because she never agreed to this arrangement).\n\nThe king keeps his promise to marry the miller's daughter. But when their first child is born, the imp returns to claim his payment: \"Now give me what you promised.\" She offers him all the wealth she has to keep the child, but the imp has no interest in her riches. \n\nHe finally consents to give up his claim to the child if she can guess his name within three days (some versions have the imp limiting the number of daily guesses to three and hence the total number of guesses allowed to a maximum of nine). \n\nHer many guesses fail, but before the final night, she wanders into the woods (in some versions, she sends a servant into the woods instead of going herself in order to keep the king's suspicions at bay), searching for him and comes across his remote mountain cottage and watches, unseen, as he hops about his fire and sings. In his song's lyrics, \"tonight tonight, my plans I make, tomorrow tomorrow, the baby I take. The queen will never win the game, for Rumpelstiltskin is my name'\", he reveals his name.\n\nWhen the imp comes to the queen on the third day, after first feigning ignorance, she reveals his name, Rumpelstiltskin, and he loses his temper and their bargain. Versions vary about whether he accuses the devil or witches of having revealed his name to the queen. In the 1812 edition of the Brothers Grimm tales, Rumpelstiltskin then \"ran away angrily, and never came back\". The ending was revised in an 1857 edition to a more gruesome ending wherein Rumpelstiltskin \"in his rage drove his right foot so far into the ground that it sank in up to his waist; then in a passion he seized the left foot with both hands and tore himself in two\". Other versions have Rumpelstiltskin driving his right foot so far into the ground that he creates a chasm and falls into it, never to be seen again. In the oral version originally collected by the Brothers Grimm, Rumpelstiltskin flies out of the window on a cooking ladle.\n\nThe name \"Rumpelstilzchen\" in German means literally \"little rattle stilt\", a \"stilt\" being a post or pole that provides support for a structure. A \"rumpelstilt\" or \"rumpelstilz\" was consequently the name of a type of goblin, also called a \"pophart\" or \"poppart\", that makes noises by rattling posts and rapping on planks. The meaning is similar to \"rumpelgeist\" (\"rattle ghost\") or \"poltergeist\", a mischievous spirit that clatters and moves household objects. (Other related concepts are \"mummarts\" or \"boggarts\" and \"hobs\", which are mischievous household spirits that disguise themselves.) The ending \"-chen\" is a German diminutive cognate to English \"-kin\".\n\nThe earliest known mention of Rumpelstiltskin occurs in Johann Fischart's \"Geschichtklitterung, or Gargantua\" of 1577 (a loose adaptation of Rabelais' \"Gargantua and Pantagruel\") which refers to an \"amusement\" for children, i.e. a children's game named \"Rumpele stilt oder der Poppart\".\n\nTranslations of the original Grimm fairy tale (KHM 55) into various languages have generally substituted different names for the dwarf whose name is \"Rumpelstilzchen\". For some languages, a name was chosen that comes close in sound to the German name: \"Rumpelstiltskin\" or \"Rumplestiltskin\" in English, \"Repelsteeltje\" in Dutch, \"Rumpelstichen\" in Portuguese, \"Rumpelstinski\" or \"Rumpelestíjeles\" in Spanish, \"Rumplcimprcampr\" or \"Rampelník\" in Czech. In Japanese it is called ルンペルシュティルツキン (\"Runperushutirutsukin\"). Russian might have the most accomplished imitation of the German name with Румпельшти́льцхен (\"Rumpelʹštílʹcxen\").\n\nIn other languages the name was translated in a poetic and approximate way. Thus \"Rumpelstilzchen\" is known as \"Päronskaft\" (literally \"Pear-stalk\") in Swedish, where the sense of \"stilt\" or \"stalk\" of the second part is retained. Likewise, in Danish and Norwegian, he is known as \"Rumleskaft\" (literally \"Rumble-shank\"). Italian has \"Tremotino\" (which loosely means \"Little Earthquake\"). French has – besides other names – \"Tracassin\" (like \"tracasser\" \"to pester\"). In other translations an entirely different and generally meaningless name was selected, such as \"Barbichu\", \"Broumpristoche\", \"Grigrigredinmenufretin\", \"Outroupistache\" or \"Perlimpinpin\" in various translations to French. Turkish translations use \"Hariparibuşki Baripinpon\" which does not mean anything and was chosen just because the name was complicated.\n\nSlovak translations use \"Martinko Klingáč\". Polish translations use \"Titelitury\" (or \"Rumpelsztyk\") and Finnish ones \"Tittelintuure\", \"Rompanruoja\" or \"Hopskukkeli\". Serbian, Bosnian and Croatian \"Cvilidreta\" (\"Whine-screamer\"). For Hebrew the poet Avraham Shlonsky composed the name (\"Ootz-li Gootz-li\", a compact and rhymy touch to the original sentence and meaning of the story, \"My adviser my midget\"), when using the fairy tale as the basis of a children's musical, now a classic among Hebrew children's plays. Greek translations have used Ρουμπελστίλτσκιν (from the English) or Κουτσοκαλιγέρης (\"Koutsokaliyéris\") which could figure as a Greek surname, formed with the particle κούτσο- (\"koútso-\" \"limping\"), and is perhaps derived from the Hebrew name. Urdu versions of the tale used the name \"Tees Mar Khan\" for the imp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "401969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=401969", "title": "Secret history", "text": "Secret history\n\nA secret history (or shadow history) is a revisionist interpretation of either fictional or real history which is claimed to have been deliberately suppressed, forgotten, or ignored by established scholars. \"Secret history\" is also used to describe an alternative interpretation of documented facts which portrays a drastically different motivation or history from established historical events.\n\nOriginally, secret histories were designed as non-fictional, revealing or claiming to reveal the truth behind the \"spin\": one such example is \"The Secret History of the Mongols\". Secret histories can range from standard historical revisionism with proper critical reexamination of historical facts to negative historical revisionism wherein facts are deliberately omitted, suppressed or distorted.\n\nThe quintessential example secret history is the \"Anecdota\" of Procopius of Caesarea (known for centuries as the \"Secret History\"). It was discovered, centuries after it was written, in the Vatican Library and published in 1623, although its existence was already known from the \"Suda\", which referred to it as the \"Anekdota\" (\"the unpublished composition\"). The \"Secret History\" covers roughly the same years as the first seven books of the \"History of Justinian's Wars\" and appears to have been written after they were published. Current consensus generally dates it to 550 or 558, possibly as late as 562. It portrays the reign of the Roman Emperor Justinian I to the great disadvantage of the Emperor, the Emperor's wife, and some of his imperial court.\n\nSecret history is sometimes used in a long-running science fiction or fantasy universe to preserve continuity with the present by reconciling paranormal, anachronistic, or otherwise notable but unrecorded events with what actually happened in known history; for instance, in the \"Star Trek\" universe, Greg Cox's novels \"\" cast the devastating Eugenics Wars of the 1990s (still well into the future when first mentioned in an episode from 1967) as shadow wars most people never knew about, in which such real-life events from that era as the Smiling Buddha nuclear test, the Yugoslav Wars during the 1990s, and the 1992 Los Angeles riots were all part of one wider conflict.\n\nA certain type of thriller can be defined as secret history. In such novels, a daring spy, assassin or commando \"nearly\" carries out a coup which would have drastically changed history as we know it. Since this is not alternate history but a secret event in our own history, the reader knows in advance that this attempt would be foiled, that all persons in the know would be sworn to secrecy and all evidence be consigned to a top secret archive, where supposedly it still is. Nevertheless, the plot fascinates many readers who want to see how close history comes to being changed (usually very, very close) and exactly how the attempt would be foiled.\n\nTwo highly successful novels are considered to have started this subgenre:\n\n\nThese two novels set the framework for many later books: following step by step both the fiendishly clever, competent and ruthless perpetrator in carrying out his design and the equally clever and competent hunter, hot on his heels throughout the book, but who would catch up with him only at the very end. Typically, historical figures – including very famous ones – appear in some key scenes, but are not major actors.\n\nMany other novels of this type followed, most of them with World War II backgrounds. Follet himself published at least two others:\n\nWorks of other writers fitting within this type include:\n\nDifferent types of secret history thriller include:\n\n\n\n\n\"Retcon\", alteration of the canonical account of past events in serial fiction, often employs aspects of secret history. A seeming continuity breach might be \"revealed\" to alter the truth of what readers were previously led to believe was a definitive story. A retcon might equally well convert an established history into a secret history. Such transformations occur with particular frequency in long-running superhero comic books.\n\n\nThe plots of some Time travel books and stories make it possible to count them as secret histories as well – since they posit that the truth about various historical figures and events is quite different from what history books recount.\n\nFor example, Poul Anderson's story \"Brave to be a King\" asserts that King Cyrus the Great, founder of the Persian Empire, was in fact a twentieth-century American time traveler stranded in the past who became a King by strange circumstances. (However, this is \"cancelled out\" at the end of the story, when the real Cyrus is restored to the timeline, and the American goes home to his own century.) Another Anderson story, \"The Sorrow of Odin the Goth\", asserts that also the Nordic god Odin/Wodan was a twentieth-century American time traveler, who sought to study the culture of the ancient Goths and ended up being regarded as a god and starting an enduring myth. \n\nPaul Levinson's \"The Plot to Save Socrates\" asserts (as its title suggests), that the philosopher Socrates did not drink hemlock, as history tells. Rather, a clone died in his place and the true Socrates lived some more years in Twenty First Century America. Also according to the same book, the politician and general Alcibiades had a long life and many adventures after the moment when history records his death; Alcibiades' mistress Timandra and the famous fourth-century mathematician Hypatia of Alexandria were one and the same person, a time-traveling American woman; the inventor Hero of Alexandria was also an American time traveler; and finally, according to the same book, the nineteenth-century publisher William Henry Appleton had an extensive secret life as a time traveler, had visited Classical Greece and met some of the famous ancient Greek writers and philosophers whose works he published, and also several times visited the twenty-first century – but always found his own nineteenth-century milieu to be the most congenial.\n\nAccording to David Drake's novel \"Birds of Prey\", the Roman Empire's Third Century Crisis was far more severe than modern historians realize, and the Empire was on the verge of final collapse and disintegration already then. The situation was saved by a time traveler from the very far future, endowed with telepathic and other superhuman powers. That traveler encountered a young junior Roman officer named Diocletian, realized his enormous potential and gave him the final push to eventually become a strong Emperor, revive and restructure the Roman Empire and give it another two hundred years of life (and much longer for its Eastern portion). Diocletian himself was completely unaware of this crucial help to his career.\n\nRay Nelson's novel \"Bĺake's Progress\" assumes that the poet William Blake and his wife Kate were accomplished time travelers who had many adventures in past and future times and in various alternate timelines, their actions profoundly effecting the course of human history. They had a child never known to recorded history, since the child - also a time traveler - was born in the distant past and lived out his life in the distant future. While it is well-known that Blake revered the poetry of John Milton, the book discloses that the two of them often met personally - the century separating them being no hindrance since Milton, too, was a time traveler and both could travel freely over millions of years. William Blake's mythology is not fictional but features actual people - or beings - whom Blake met on his wanderings through time. The character Urizen was in fact Blake's own son, born of a relationship with a woman of the far future. In addition to all the above, the book makes the more mundane assertion that many of the engravings attributed to Blake were in fact made by Kate and that in fact she was the better engraver of the two.\n\n"}

{"id": "31073270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31073270", "title": "Skopje 2014", "text": "Skopje 2014\n\nSkopje 2014 () is a project financed by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, with the main ideology being based on that of the then-ruling party VMRO-DPMNE, with the purpose of giving the capital Skopje a more classical appeal. The project, officially announced in 2010, consists mainly of the construction of colleges, museums and government buildings, as well as the erection of monuments depicting historical figures from the region of Macedonia. Around 20 buildings and over 40 monuments are planned to be constructed as part of the project. \n\nIn fact this political project is nation-building one and tries to impose a new revisionist narrative of the Macedonian history, promoting Macedonian identity, with unbroken continuity from the antiquity over the middle ages to the modern times. The Skopje 2014 project has been criticized by various groups since the time it was first announced for constructing nationalistic historicist kitsch. Skopje 2014 has also generated controversy for its cost, for which estimates range from 80 to 500 million euros.\n\nThe Skopje 2014 project encompasses the construction, from 2010 to 2014, of 136 structures built at a cost of more than US$700 million.\n\nIn February 2018, the authorities and institutions of the country announced the halt of the project and then set up a Commission for envisaging the removal of its controversial monuments and statues.\n\nThe 1963 Skopje earthquake destroyed approximately 80% of the city, including most of the neoclassical buildings in the central part of Skopje. The rebuilding that followed saw the construction of mostly plain modernist architecture. This is one of the reasons given by the VMRO-DPMNE government for the necessity of the project, to give Skopje a more monumental and visually pleasing image. Another reason is to restore the missing sense of national pride and create a more metropolitan atmosphere. In a speech at the opening of Porta Macedonia in January 2012, then Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski stated that Skopje 2014 was his idea.\n\nThe Skopje 2014 project has been criticized by various groups since the time it was first announced. The cost of the project is estimated at anywhere from 80 to more than 500 million euros and is seen by many as a waste of resources in a country with high unemployment and poverty. The project is also believed by critics to be a distraction from these problems.\n\nThe Social Democratic Union of Macedonia, the main opposition party, opposes the project and has alleged that the monuments could have cost six to ten times less than what the government paid.\n\nThe project is seen as a part of the government's \"antiquisation\" policy, in which the country seeks to claim ancient Macedonian figures like Alexander the Great and Philip II of Macedon for itself. The timing of the project, following the country's non-invitation to NATO due to its continued naming dispute with Greece, has led to speculation that it is retaliation or an attempt to put pressure on Greece. Some residents see the scheme as the embodiment of nationalism by a conservative government focused as much on giving the metropolis a facelift as changing the nation's history and have described it as a mini-Las Vegas while others appreciate its classical nod to the past.\n\nSam Vaknin, a former adviser to Nikola Gruevski, has stated that the project is not anti-Greek or anti-Bulgarian, but anti-Albanian. In an interview, he said \"Antiquisation has a double goal, which is to marginalise the Albanians and create an identity that will not allow Albanians to become Macedonians.\" The project, however, later included depictions of ethnic Albanians in the monuments including Nexhat Agolli, Josif Bageri, and Pjetër Bogdani, as well as others on the Art Bridge, and includes the construction of Skanderbeg Square.\n\nArchitects have criticized the aesthetics of the project and believe the money could have been spent on constructing modern buildings. It has also been described as nationalist kitsch which \"brings unknown history\" to the citizens and current prime minister Zoran Zaev has labeled it an \"idiotic project\".\n\nIn late February 2018, the government and institutions of the Republic of Macedonia announced the halt of the Skopje 2014 program and begun removing its controversial monuments and statues. The Macedonian Ministry of Culture also has set up a Commission to envisage the possibility of removing the rest of them, such as of Alexander the Great and Philip II of Macedon. As a first step, the monument of Andon Kyoseto was dismantled, as one of the mostly disputed of the project. In June 2018 the Macedonian Government announced that the monuments would be renamed and marked with inscriptions honouring Greek-Macedonian friendship. \n\nThe Skopje 2014 project calls for two new pedestrian bridges to be built across the Vardar in the centre of the city. One is the Art Bridge, which is being constructed between the Freedom Bridge and the also under-construction Eye Bridge. It is expected to cost 2.5 million euros. The bridge will include 29 sculptures, with 14 at each end and one in the centre. It will be 83 metres (272.3 feet) in length and 9.2 m (30.2 ft) in width, while the central part of the bridge will be 12 m (39.4 ft) wide.\n\nThe other bridge being constructed as part of the project is the Eye Bridge. Situated between the Stone Bridge and the under-construction Art Bridge, it began construction in 2011. The pedestrian bridge will include 28 sculptures and will cost around 1.5 million euros.\n\nThe project also includes plans to renovate existing bridges in central Skopje, one of which is the Freedom Bridge, which connects Vojvoda Vasil Adžilarski Street in Centar Municipality to Stiv Naumov Street in Čair Municipality. First constructed in 1936, the renovation began in 2011 and is expected to be completed in May, 2014. The total cost will be roughly 1.15 million euros.\n\nThe renovation of the Goce Delčev Bridge, which connects Ilinden Boulevard in Centar to Goce Delčev Boulevard in Čair across the Vardar, began on April 11, 2011 and finished later in the year. The renovation included new gold-coloured fencing and 26 lampposts. The project cost roughly 500,000 euros, including 60,000 euros for the new lighting. Four statues depicting lions, two at each end, were also placed on the bridge in 2010. The ones on the western side were cast in Florence and cost 1.5 million euros.\n\nThe Revolution Bridge, first built in 1963 across the Vardar connecting Kočo Racin Boulevard in Centar to Krste Misirkov Boulevard in Čair, was also renovated as part of the Skopje 2014 project. It began on December 9, 2010 and was completed in May, 2011. The renovation included basic repairs as well as the installation of 22 lampposts and iron-wrought fencing. The renovation cost 450,000 euros.\n\nNotable in Skopje 2014 for its bold modern architecture as opposed to the usual neoclassical style seen in the project, the under-construction concert hall to house the Macedonian Philharmonic Orchestra is one of the first buildings to begin construction in the project, with the cornerstone having been laid in June 2009. The exterior of the building is nearing completion. The concert hall is planned to have excellent acoustics and will have a capacity of 900 seats.\n\nThe Museum of Archaeology began construction in 2009 and is expected to be formally opened in September, 2014. Although the building will primarily serve as a museum, it will also house the Constitutional Court and the National Archive of the Republic of Macedonia. It is situated on the eastern bank of the Vardar, across the river from Macedonia Square. The exterior of the museum is almost complete, as of June 2012, and is among the more monumental buildings of the project, with its Greek Revival architecture. VMRO-DPMNE, the ruling party, states the budget for the construction as 436,000,000 denars.\n\nThe Museum of the Macedonian Struggle for Statehood and Independence − Museum of VMRO and Museum of the Victims of the Communist Regime exhibits the strive for an independent Macedonian nation from the Ottoman Empire and later Yugoslavia. It is divided into 16 departments and includes over 100 wax figures of historical individuals. The museum lies on the eastern bank of the Vardar River just northwest of the Museum of Archaeology, opposite Macedonia Square. Construction began in June 2008 and it formally opened on September 10, 2011. The total cost of the museum, which covers 2,500 m (26,909.8 ft), was roughly 10 million euros.\n\nThe former National Theatre destroyed in the 1963 Skopje earthquake will be completely reconstructed, as part of the Skopje 2014 project. Construction of the building, however, began in December 2007, three years before the official announcing of Skopje 2014. Construction was originally planned to be completed in 2009, though it ended up being completed a few years after. The theatre stands on its original location on the eastern bank of the Vardar. The cost is estimated to be at least 6 million euros and may be as high as 30 million euros.\n\nThe Skopje 2014 project also includes plans to transform the façades of existing buildings in central Skopje into the neoclassical style. This includes the following buildings:\n\n\nThe following are new buildings being constructed to house various governmental functions.\n\nThe cornerstone for the new building to house the Agency for Electronic Communications was laid on 30 March 2011. It is being constructed on the eastern bank of the Vardar in between two other Skopje 2014 buildings, the Museum of Archaeology and the Financial Police Building.\n\nThe total cost of the building's construction is around 8.5 million euros, which the government claims will be fully funded by the Agency's budget. It is expected to be completed in 15 months or by the late summer of 2012.\n\nA new Criminal Court Building is being constructed as part of the project. The cornerstone for the building was laid on 25 May 2010. The building, 10 stories tall, has been topped out. In it will be 74 judicial offices, 22 high courts, and 2 large courtrooms. The 2-story basement will contain parking. The building, reported to cost 8.3 million euros, was planned to be completed after 18 months of construction.\n\nOn 11 October 2010 the cornerstone for the new building to house the Financial Police of the Republic of Macedonia was laid. The site is located between the new Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the new Agency for Electronic Communications. The building, currently several months from completion, is cylindrical in shape and is capped by a dome-shaped roof. The total cost of construction will be roughly 13 million euros.\n\nThe government, in March 2011, invested 8.9 million euros into transforming an abandoned uncompleted building in central Skopje into a new home for the Ministry of Finance. Like the other governmental buildings in Skopje 2014, it will have a neoclassical appearance. Though it was scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of 2012, the building remains far from completion.\n\nConstruction of the new Ministry of Foreign Affairs building began in January 2010. It is located on the eastern bank of the Vardar between the Financial Police Building and Stiv Naumov Street. It will have two basement levels, seven above-ground levels, and a terrace atop the building. The building, which is nearly complete on the exterior, stands at a height of 27 m (88.6 ft) and will have costed 13.5 million euros when completed.\n\nA new city hall for Skopje is being constructed below the Kale Fortress, on the eastern bank of the Vardar. It is being constructed, as most other buildings in the project, in the neoclassical style and will cost roughly 15 million euros. It will be 21 m (68.9 ft) tall, with six above-ground floors.\n\nAlthough a new city hall for Skopje is being constructed, the former one destroyed in the 1963 Skopje earthquake will be fully reconstructed, as part of the Skopje 2014 project. It will be built on its original location at the north side of Macedonia Square, to the west of the Vardar Quay. A Greek investor will be building the Old City Hall, as well as a Marriott Hotel to the immediate left of the building, after purchasing the land in March 2011.\n\nAmong the buildings being constructed below the Kale Fortress on the eastern bank of the Vardar is the Water Management Building. Construction of the building began in December 2011. It is expected to be completed in 3 years at a cost of 10 million euros.\n\nThe monument of Justinian I, born in Tauresium just outside modern Skopje, arrived at Macedonia Square on June 16, 2011. Similar to the monument of Tsar Samuil, also on Macedonia Square, it consists of Justinian I sitting on a throne, which is placed on a pedestal. The monument is made of white marble with the exception of the bronze reliefs on the pedestal, also characteristics it shares with the Tsar Samuil monument. The pedestal is 3.5 m (11.5 ft) tall, while Justinian upon his throne measures a further 5 m (16.4 ft) in height.\n\nThe monument sits just north of the Stone Bridge, at the western bank of the Vardar River. It was made in Florence and cost over 1 million euros.\n\nThe construction of a monument consisting of a statue of Skopje native Mother Teresa and a fountain is planned. The monument will be located near the MEPSO building, which is north of Macedonia Square near the Vardar Quay, though location on the roundabout near the Goce Delčev Bridge is also a possibility. It is planned to stand around 30 m (98.4 ft) in height, even taller than the Warrior on a Horse monument.\n\nIt has been reported that a donation from India will fund the construction of the new Mother Teresa monument, who is already memorialized in the city with the Memorial House of Mother Teresa and a plaque marking the spot of her birth.\n\nThe Pavilion at Macedonia Square is situated on the north side of Macedonia Square. Construction began in early 2011 and was completed later that year at a cost of 350,000 euros. The pavilion consists of a dome supported by several columns, covering a statue of a romantic couple.\n\nOne of the main symbols of the project is Porta Macedonia, a triumphal arch situated on 11 October Street, near Macedonia Square. The arch is meant to commemorate the long struggle for Macedonian independence. It is 21 m (68.9 ft) tall and contains 32 reliefs carved on the outside, depicting events from pre-history to the independence of the Republic of Macedonia. The inside of the arch consists of two levels, in which a souvenir shop and a gallery are located, and a rooftop observation deck. It formally opened to the public on Christmas Eve, January 6, 2012. The construction of Porta Macedonia is estimated at 4.5 million euros.\n\nThe monument to Samuel of Bulgaria is among the new focal points of Macedonia Square. Officially unveiled on 28 June 2011, it is situated in front of the Pelister building, to the right of where Macedonia Street meets Macedonia Square.\n\nThe monument, mostly in white marble, consists of a depiction of Tsar Samuil sitting on a throne, totaling 5 m (16.4 ft) in height, and is placed on a pedestal which itself is a further 3.5 m (11.5 ft) tall. The reliefs on the sides of the pedestal are bronze. Tsar Samuil, in the monument, holds a scepter. Made in Florence, the total cost of the Tsar Samuil monument was roughly 3.5 million euros. \n\nThe fringe theory Samuil being the first Tsar of the Macedonian Slavs is held mainly in the Republic of Macedonia. This view is ahistorical, as it projects modern ethnic distinctions into the past.\n\nOn the opposite side of the Stone Bridge from Macedonia Square is Karpoš's Rebellion Square, which serves as a main entrance to the Old Bazaar. It is undergoing a major reconstruction, as part of Skopje 2014, and its new centerpiece will be the statue and fountain officially named \"Warrior,\" though it is widely believed that the statue is a depiction of Philip II of Macedon, not to be confused with the equestrian statue of Philip II in Skopje's Avtokomanda neighborhood. The statue was placed onto the square on 22 May 2012.\n\nMade in Vicenza, the statue is 15 m (49.2 ft) tall and is placed on a 13 m (42.7 ft) tall pedestal. The entire monument will cost roughly 2 million euros.\n\nPerhaps the main symbol of the Skopje 2014 project is the Warrior on a Horse () statue and fountain in the centre of Macedonia Square. It is typically thought to depict Alexander the Great, though it is not officially named for him. \n\nThe statue was sculpted by Valentina Stevanovska and cast in Florence. \"Alexander\" was officially completed on September 8, 2011 to commemorate 20 years of the independence of the Republic of Macedonia. It is 14.5 m (47.6 ft) tall and it sits on a cylindrical column, which itself is 10 m (32.8 ft) in height. The column consists of three large ivory sections, each separated by a thinner bronze ring. Each section contains reliefs. The column stands in a fountain. At the base of the column are 8 bronze soldiers, each 3 m (9.8 ft) tall. There are also 8 bronze lions, each 2.5 m (8.3 ft) tall, around the edges of the fountain pool, four of which act as part of the fountain, releasing water from their mouths. The fountain also plays music.\n\nThe total cost of the Warrior on a Horse monument is roughly 7.5 million euros.\n\nAside from the major monuments in the Skopje 2014 above, many other ones have been erected, or are planned to be erected in the city. These include the following:\n\nThe first of four building-boats as restaurants and cafes just in the Vardar River opened in July 2014. The boats are erected into the riverbed and, thus, will remain in their planned spots permanently. The boats, all to be situated in central Skopje, were intended to be in the Baroque style.\n\nThe erection of a Ferris wheel is foreseen on the Vardar River. It will require the construction of a new pedestrian bridge, to run from the Museum of the Macedonian Struggle to the MEPSO Building, upon which it will stand. No final plan for the project has been approved.\n\nThe addition of fountains on the Vardar River was planned early on in the project. They were completed in 2010. The fountains have been criticized for reportedly releasing mud, as well as for acting as a filter for trash flowing down the river.\n\nDirector of Cultural Heritage and archaeologist Pasko Kuzman has announced a plan to restore and reconstruct the Kale Fortress. The plan also includes the construction of a museum to house Byzantine archaeological finds from the fortress, as well as reconstructions of a prehistoric house and an Ottoman guard tower to be built on the place of their ruins. Souvenir shops and cafes are also foreseen additions. The most controversial part of the restoration of the fortress is the construction of a church, which has been protested by ethnic Albanians.\n\nKarpoš's Rebellion Square is situated opposite the Vardar River of Macedonia Square and is undergoing a significant reconstruction. Plans include the erection of a statue and fountain depicting Phillip II of Macedon, though officially named \"Warrior,\" at the far northeast side of the square. Another monument consisting of a fountain and statues representing the Mothers of Macedonia is being constructed in front of the Warrior monument. In front of this will be two monuments, also consisting of a fountain and statues, depicting horses. The two will be situated on either side of the entrance to the square from the Stone Bridge.\n\nA new office building was constructed on the south side of Macedonia Square, on the Vardar Quay. It stands on the same place as the former headquarters of the National Bank, which was destroyed in the 1963 Skopje earthquake. The new office building is similar in shape to the former bank building, though it is not in the neoclassical style, which also makes it somewhat unusual in the Skopje 2014 project.\n\nAn existing statue of Skanderbeg, an important historical figure to ethnic Albanians, will be the main fixture of an under construction square that will bear his name in Skopje's Čair Municipality. The square's total cost is estimated at around 10 million euros and is expected to be completed in 2014. The square will cover 28,000 m (301,389 ft) and will extend from Macedonian Philharmonic and Macedonian Opera to the Old Bazaar. This will require building a portion of the square on top of Goce Delčev Boulevard. Aside from plenty of open space, the square will contain an amphitheatre, a fountain, and underground parking.\n\nOther components of Skopje 2014 include the following:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "795212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=795212", "title": "Terra sigillata", "text": "Terra sigillata\n\nTerra sigillata is a term with at least three distinct meanings: as a description of medieval medicinal earth; in archaeology, as a general term for some of the fine red Ancient Roman pottery with glossy surface slips made in specific areas of the Roman Empire; and more recently, as a description of a contemporary studio pottery technique supposedly inspired by ancient pottery. Usually roughly translated as 'sealed earth', the meaning of 'terra sigillata' is 'clay bearing little images' (Latin \"sigilla\"), not 'clay with a sealed (impervious) surface'. The archaeological term is applied, however, to plain-surfaced pots as well as those decorated with figures in relief.\n\nTerra sigillata as an archaeological term refers chiefly to a specific type of plain and decorated tableware made in Italy and in Gaul (France and the Rhineland) during the Roman Empire. These vessels have glossy surface slips ranging from a soft lustre to a brilliant glaze-like shine, in a characteristic colour range from pale orange to bright red; they were produced in standard shapes and sizes and were manufactured on an industrial scale and widely exported. The sigillata industries grew up in areas where there were existing traditions of pottery manufacture, and where the clay deposits proved suitable. The products of the Italian workshops are also known as Aretine ware from Arezzo and have been collected and admired since the Renaissance. The wares made in the Gaulish factories are often referred to by English-speaking archaeologists as samian ware. Closely related pottery fabrics made in the North African and Eastern provinces of the Roman Empire are not usually referred to as terra sigillata, but by more specific names, e.g. African red slip wares. All these types of pottery are significant for archaeologists: they can often be closely dated, and their distribution casts light on aspects of the ancient Roman economy.\n\nModern \"Terra sig\" should be clearly distinguished from the close reproductions of Roman wares made by some potters deliberately recreating and using the Roman methods. The finish called 'terra sigillata' by studio potters can be made from most clay, mixed as a very thin liquid slip and settled to separate out only the finest particles to be used as terra sigillata. When applied to unfired clay surfaces, \"terra sig\" can be polished with a soft cloth or brush to achieve a shine ranging from a smooth silky lustre to a high gloss. The surface of ancient terra sigillata vessels did not require this burnishing or polishing. Burnishing was a technique used on some wares in the Roman period, but terra sigillata was not one of them. The polished surface can only be retained if fired within the low-fire range and will lose its shine if fired higher, but can still display an appealing silky quality.\n\nThe oldest use for the term terra sigillata was for a medicinal clay from the island of Lemnos. The latter was called \"sealed\" because cakes of it were pressed together and stamped with the head of Artemis. Later, it bore the seal of the Ottoman sultan. This soil's particular mineralic content was such that, in the Renaissance, it was seen as a proof against poisoning, as well as a general cure for any bodily impurities, and it was highly prized as a medicine and medicinal component.\n\nIn 1580, a miner named Adreas Berthold traveled around Germany selling Silesian terra sigillata made from a special clay dug from the hills outside the town of Striga, now Strzegom, Poland, and processed into small tablets. He promoted it as a panacea effective against every type of poison and several diseases, including plague. Berthold invited authorities to test it themselves. In two cases, physicians, princes and town leaders conducted trials involving dogs who were either given poison followed by the antidote or poison alone; the dogs who got the antidote lived and the dogs who got the poison alone died. In 1581, a prince tested the antidote on a condemned criminal, who survived.\n\nIn 1588 English ethnographer and translator Thomas Harriot wrote in \"A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia\" that Algonquians of the mid–Atlantic region treated various sores and wounds with \"wapeih\", a kind of terra sigillata that English surgeons and physicians found to be of the same kind \"of vertue and more effectuall\" than the contemporary European sort.\n\nIn archaeological usage, the term \"terra sigillata\" without further qualification normally denotes the Arretine ware of Italy, made at Arezzo, and Gaulish samian ware manufactured first in South Gaul, particularly at La Graufesenque, near Millau, and later at Lezoux and adjacent sites near Clermont-Ferrand, and at east Gaulish sites such as Trier, Sinzig and Rheinzabern. These high-quality tablewares were particularly popular and widespread in the Western Roman Empire from about 50 BC to the early 3rd century AD. Definitions of 'TS' have grown up from the earliest days of antiquarian studies, and are far from consistent; one survey of Classical art says: \"Terra sigillata\" ... is a Latin term used by modern scholars to designate a class of decorated red-gloss pottery ... not all red-gloss ware was decorated, and hence the more inclusive term 'Samian ware' is sometimes used to characterize all varieties of it.\n- whereas Anthony King's definition, following the more usual practice among Roman pottery specialists, makes no mention of decoration, but states that terra sigillata is 'alternatively known as samian ware'. However, 'samian ware' is normally used only to refer to the sub-class of terra sigillata made in ancient Gaul. In European languages other than English, terra sigillata, or a translation (e.g. \"terre sigillée\"), is always used for both Italian and Gaulish products. Nomenclature has to be established at an early stage of research into a subject, and antiquarians of the 18th and 19th centuries often used terms that we would not choose today, but as long as their meaning is clear and well-established, this does not matter, and detailed study of the history of the terminology is really a side-issue that is of academic interest only. Scholars writing in English now often use \"red gloss wares\" or \"red slip wares\", both to avoid these issues of definition, and also because many other wares of the Roman period share aspects of technique with the traditional sigillata fabrics.\nItalian and Gaulish TS vessels were made in standardised shapes constituting services of matching dishes, bowls and serving vessels. These changed and evolved over time, and have been very minutely classified; the first major scheme, by the German classical archaeologist Hans Dragendorff (1895), is still in use (as e.g. \"Dr.29\"), and there have been many others, such as the classifications of Déchelette, Knorr, Hermet, Walters, Curle, Loeschcke, Ritterling, Hermet and Ludowici, and more recently, the \"Conspectus\" of Arretine forms and Hayes's type-series of African Red Slip and Eastern sigillatas. These reference sometimes make it possible to date the manufacture of a broken decorated sherd to within 20 years or less.\n\nMost of the forms that were decorated with figures in low relief were thrown in pottery moulds, the inner surfaces of which had been decorated using fired-clay stamps or punches (usually referred to as \"poinçons\") and some free-hand work using a stylus. The mould was therefore decorated on its interior surface with a full decorative design of impressed, intaglio (hollowed) motifs that would appear in low relief on any bowl formed in it. As the bowl dried, the shrinkage was sufficient for it to be withdrawn from the mould, in order to carry out any finishing work, which might include the addition of foot-rings, the shaping and finishing of rims, and in all cases the application of the slip. Barbotine and appliqué ('sprigged') techniques were sometimes used to decorate vessels of closed forms. Study of the characteristic decorative motifs, combined in some cases with name-stamps of workshops incorporated into the decoration, and also sometimes with the cursive signatures of mouldmakers, makes it possible to build up a very detailed knowledge of the industry. Careful observation of form and fabric is therefore usually enough for an archaeologist experienced in the study of sigillata to date and identify a broken sherd: a potter's stamp or moulded decoration provides even more precise evidence. The classic guide by Oswald and Pryce, published in 1920 set out many of the principles, but the literature on the subject goes back into the 19th century, and is now extremely voluminous, including many monographs on specific regions, as well as excavation reports on important sites that have produced significant assemblages of sigillata wares, and articles in learned journals, some of which are dedicated to Roman pottery studies.\nThe motifs and designs on the relief-decorated wares echo the general traditions of Graeco-Roman decorative arts, with depictions of deities, references to myths and legends, and popular themes such as hunting and erotic scenes. Individual figure-types, like the vessel-shapes, have been classified, and in many cases they may be linked with specific potters or workshops. Some of the decoration relates to contemporary architectural ornament, with egg-and-tongue (ovolo) mouldings, acanthus and vine scrolls and the like. While the decoration of Arretine ware is often highly naturalistic in style, and is closely comparable with silver tableware of the same period, the designs on the Gaulish products, made by provincial artisans adopting Classical subjects, are intriguing for their expression of 'romanisation', the fusion of Classical and native cultural and artistic traditions.\n\nMany of the Gaulish manufacturing sites have been extensively excavated and studied. At La Graufesenque in southern Gaul, documentary evidence in the form of lists or tallies apparently fired with single kiln-loads, giving potters' names and numbers of pots have long been known, and they suggest very large loads of 25,000–30,000 vessels. Though not all the kilns at this, or other, manufacturing sites were so large, the excavation of the \"grand four\" (big kiln) at La Graufesenque, which was in use in the late 1st and early 2nd century, confirms the scale of the industry. It is a rectangular stone-built structure measuring 11.3 m. by 6.8 m. externally, with an original height estimated at 7 metres. With up to nine 'storeys' within (dismantled after each firing), formed of tile floors and vertical columns in the form of clay pipes or tubes, which also served to conduct the heat, it has been estimated that it was capable of firing 30,000–40,000 vessels at a time, at a temperature of around 1000 °C.\n\nA 2005 work has shown that the slip is a matrix of mainly silicon and aluminium oxides, within which are suspended sub-microscopic crystals of haematite and corundum. The matrix itself does not contain any metallic ions, the haematite is substituted in aluminium and titanium while the corundum is substituted in iron. The two crystal populations are homogenously dispersed within the matrix. The colour of haematite depends on the crystal size. Large crystals of this mineral are black but as the size decreases to sub-micron the colour shifts to red. The fraction of aluminium has a similar effect. It was formerly thought that the difference between 'red' and 'black' samian was due to the presence (black) or absence (red) of reducing gases from the kiln and that the construction of the kiln was so arranged as to prevent the reducing gases from the fuel from coming into contact with the pottery. The presence of iron oxides in the clay/slip was thought to be reflected in the colour according to the oxidation state of the iron (Fe[III] for the red and Fe[II] for the black, the latter produced by the reducing gases coming into contact with the pottery during firing). It now appears as a result of this recent work that this is not the case and that the colour of the glossy slip is in fact due to no more than the crystal size of the minerals dispersed within the matrix glass.\n\nArretine ware, in spite of its very distinctive appearance, was an integral part of the wider picture of fine ceramic tablewares in the Graeco-Roman world of the Hellenistic and early Roman period. That picture must itself be seen in relation to the luxury tablewares made of silver. Centuries before Italian terra sigillata was made, Attic painted vases, and later their regional variants made in Italy, involved the preparation of a very fine clay body covered with a slip that fired to a glossy surface without the need for any polishing or burnishing. Greek painted wares also involved the precise understanding and control of firing conditions to achieve the contrasts of black and red.\nGlossy-slipped black pottery made in Etruria and Campania continued this technological tradition, though painted decoration gave way to simpler stamped motifs and in some cases, to applied motifs moulded in relief. The tradition of decorating entire vessels in low relief was also well established in Greece and Asia Minor by the time the Arretine industry began to expand in the middle of the 1st century BC, and examples were imported into Italy. Relief-decorated cups, some in lead-glazed wares, were produced at several eastern centres, and undoubtedly played a part in the technical and stylistic evolution of decorated Arretine, but Megarian bowls, made chiefly in Greece and Asia Minor, are usually seen as the most direct inspiration. These are small, hemispherical bowls without foot-rings, and their decoration is frequently very reminiscent of contemporary silver bowls, with formalised, radiating patterns of leaves and flowers. The crisp and precisely profiled forms of the plain dishes and cups were also part of a natural evolution of taste and fashion in the Mediterranean world of the 1st century BC.\n\nArretine ware began to be manufactured at and near Arezzo (Tuscany) a little before the middle of the 1st century BC. The industry expanded rapidly in a period when Roman political and military influence was spreading far beyond Italy: for the inhabitants of the first provinces of the Roman Empire in the reign of the Emperor Augustus (\"reg.\" 27 BC – AD 14), this tableware, with its precise forms, shiny surface, and, on the decorated vessels, its visual introduction to Classical art and mythology, must have deeply impressed some inhabitants of the new northern provinces of the Empire. Certainly it epitomised certain aspects of Roman taste and technical expertise. Pottery industries in the areas we now call north-east France and Belgium quickly began to copy the shapes of plain Arretine dishes and cups in the wares now known as Gallo-Belgic, and in South and Central Gaul, it was not long before local potters also began to emulate the mould-made decoration and the glossy red slip itself.\n\nThe most recognisable decorated Arretine form is Dragendorff 11, a large, deep goblet on a high pedestal base, closely resembling some silver table vessels of the same period, such as the Warren Cup. The iconography, too, tended to match the subjects and styles seen on silver plate, namely mythological and genre scenes, including erotic subjects, and small decorative details of swags, leafy wreaths and ovolo (egg-and-tongue) borders that may be compared with elements of Augustan architectural ornament. The deep form of the Dr.11 allowed the \"poinçons\" (stamps) used making the moulds of human and animal figures to be fairly large, often about 5–6 cm high, and the modelling is frequently very accomplished indeed, attracting the interest of modern art-historians as well as archaeologists. Major workshops, such as those of M.Perennius Tigranus, P. Cornelius and Cn. Ateius, stamped their products, and the names of the factory-owners and of the workers within the factories, which often appear on completed bowls and on plain wares, have been extensively studied, as have the forms of the vessels, and the details of their dating and distribution.\nItalian sigillata was not made only at or near Arezzo itself: some of the important Arezzo businesses had branch factories in Pisa, and by the beginning of the 1st century AD, the Ateius and Rasinius workshops had set up branch factories at La Muette, near Lyon in Central Gaul. Nor were the classic Arretine wares of the Augustan period the only forms of terra sigillata made in Italy: later sigillata industries in the Po Valley and elsewhere continued the tradition. The history of sigillata manufacture in Italy is succinctly summarised in Hayes 1997, pages 41–52.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, examples of the ware that were serendipitously discovered in digging foundations in Arezzo drew admiring attention as early as the 13th century, when Restoro d'Arezzo's massive encyclopedia included a chapter praising the refined Roman ware discovered in his native city, \"what is perhaps the first account of an aspect of ancient art to be written since classical times\". The chronicler Giovanni Villani also mentioned the ware.\n\nThe first published study of Arretine ware was that of Fabroni in 1841, and by the late 19th and early 20th centuries, German scholars in particular had made great advances in systematically studying and understanding both Arretine ware and the Gaulish samian that occurred on Roman military sites being excavated in Germany. Dragendorff's classification was expanded by other scholars, including S. Loeschcke in his study of the Italian sigillata excavated at the early Roman site of Haltern. Research on Arretine ware has continued very actively throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, for example with the publication and revision of Oxé-Comfort and the \"Conspectus\" of forms, bringing earlier work on stamps and shapes up to date. As with all ancient pottery studies, each generation asks new questions and applies new techniques (such as analysis of clays) in the attempt to find the answers.\n\nSigillata vessels, both plain and decorated, were manufactured at several centres in southern France, including Bram, Montans, La Graufesenque, Le Rozier and Banassac, from the late 1st century BC: of these, La Graufesenque, near Millau, was the principal producer and exporter. Although the establishment of sigillata potteries in Gaul may well have arisen initially to meet local demand and to undercut the prices of imported Italian goods, they became enormously successful in their own right, and by the later 1st century AD, South Gaulish samian was being exported not only to other provinces in the north-west of the Empire, but also to Italy and other regions of the Mediterranean, North Africa and even the eastern Empire. One of the finds in the ruins of Pompeii, destroyed by the eruption of Vesuvius in August AD 79, was a consignment of South Gaulish sigillata, still in its packing crate; like all finds from the Vesuvian sites, this hoard of pottery is invaluable as dating evidence.\n\nSouth Gaulish samian typically has a redder slip and deeper pink fabric than Italian sigillata. The best slips, vivid red and of an almost mirror-like brilliance, were achieved during the Claudian and early Neronian periods (Claudius, \"reg\". AD 41–54; Nero, \"reg\". AD 54–68). At the same period, some workshops experimented briefly with a marbled red-and-yellow slip, a variant that never became generally popular. Early production of plain forms in South Gaul initially followed the Italian models closely, and even the characteristic Arretine decorated form, Dragendorff 11, was made. But many new shapes quickly evolved, and by the second half of the 1st century AD, when Italian sigillata was no longer influential, South Gaulish samian had created its own characteristic repertoire of forms. The two principal decorated forms were Dragendorff 30, a deep, cylindrical bowl, and Dragendorff 29, a carinated ('keeled') shallow bowl with a marked angle, emphasised by a moulding, mid-way down the profile. The footring is low, and potters' stamps are usually bowl-maker's marks placed in the interior base, so that vessels made from the same, or parallel, moulds may bear different names. The rim of the 29, small and upright in early examples of the form, but much deeper and more everted by the 70s of the 1st century, is finished with rouletted decoration, and the relief-decorated surfaces necessarily fall into two narrow zones. These were usually decorated with floral and foliate designs of wreaths and scrolls at first: the Dr.29 resting on its rim illustrated in the lead section of this article is an early example, less angular than the developed form of the 60s and 70s, with decoration consisting of simple, very elegant leaf-scrolls. Small human and animal figures, and more complex designs set out in separate panels, became more popular by the 70s of the 1st century. Larger human and animal figures could be used on the Dr.30 vessels, but while many of these have great charm, South Gaulish craftsmen never achieved, and perhaps never aspired to, the Classical naturalism of some of their Italian counterparts.\n\nIn the last two decades of the 1st century, the Dragendorff 37, a deep, rounded vessel with a plain upright rim, overtook the 29 in popularity. This simple shape remained the standard Gaulish samian relief-decorated form, from all Gaulish manufacturing regions, for more than a century. Small relief-decorated beakers such as forms Déchelette 67 and Knorr 78 were also made in South Gaul, as were occasional 'one-off' or very ambitious mould-made vessels, such as large thin-walled flagons and flasks. But the mass of South Gaulish samian found on Roman sites of the 1st century AD consists of plain dishes, bowls and cups, especially Dr.18 (a shallow dish) and Dr.27 (a little cup with a distinctive double curve to the profile), many of which bear potters' name-stamps, and the large decorated forms 29, 30 and 37.\n\nA local industry inspired by Arretine and South Gaulish imports grew up in the Iberian provinces in the 1st century AD. \"Terra sigillata hispanica\" developed its own distinctive forms and designs, and continued in production into the late Roman period, the 4th and 5th centuries AD. It was not exported to other regions.\n\nThe principal Central Gaulish samian potteries were situated at Lezoux and Les Martres-de-Veyre, not far from Clermont-Ferrand in the Auvergne. Production had already begun at Lezoux in the Augustan period (Augustus, \"reg\". 27 BC–AD 14), but it was not until the reign of Trajan (AD 98–117), and the beginning of a decline in the South Gaulish export trade, that Central Gaulish samian ware became important outside its own region. Though it never achieved the extensive geographical distribution of the South Gaulish factories, in the provinces of Gaul and Britain, it was by far the most common type of fine tableware, plain and decorated, in use during the 2nd century AD. The quality of the ware and the slip is usually excellent, and some of the products of Les Martres-de-Veyre, in particular, are outstanding, with a lustrous slip and a very hard, dense body. The surface colour tends towards a more orange-red hue than the typical South Gaulish slips.\n\nVessel-forms that had been made in South Gaul continued to be produced, though as the decades passed, they evolved and changed with the normal shifts of fashion, and some new shapes were created, such as the plain bowl with a horizontal flange below the rim, Dr.38. Mortaria, food-preparation bowls with a gritted interior surface, were also made in Central Gaulish samian fabric in the second half of the 2nd century (Dr.45). There is a small sub-class of Central Gaulish samian ware with a glossy black slip, though the dividing line between black terra sigillata and other fine black-gloss wares, which were also manufactured in the area, is sometimes hazy. When a vessel is a classic samian form and decorated in relief in the style of a known samian potter, but finished with black slip rather than a red one, it may be classed as black samian.\nThough the Central Gaulish forms continued and built upon the South Gaulish traditions, the decoration of the principal decorated forms, Dr.30 and Dr.37, was distinctive. New human and animal figure-types appeared, generally modelled with greater realism and sophistication than those of La Graufesenque and other South Gaulish centres. Figure-types and decorative details have been classified, and can often be linked to specific workshops Lezoux wares also included vases decorated with barbotine relief, with appliqué motifs, and a class usually referred to as 'cut-glass' decoration, with geometric patterns cut into the surface of the vessel before slipping and firing. Two standard 'plain' types made in considerable numbers in Central Gaul also included barbotine decoration, Dr.35 and 36, a matching cup and dish with a curved horizontal rim embellished with a stylised scroll of leaves in relief.\n\nDuring the second half of the 2nd century, some Lezoux workshops making relief-decorated bowls, above all that of Cinnamus, dominated the market with their large production. The wares of Cinnamus, Paternus, Divixtus, Doeccus, Advocisus, Albucius and some others often included large, easily legible name-stamps incorporated into the decoration, clearly acting as brand-names or advertisements. Though these vessels were very competently made, they are heavy and somewhat coarse in form and finish compared with earlier Gaulish samian ware.\n\nFrom the end of the 2nd century, the export of sigillata from Central Gaul rapidly, perhaps even abruptly, ceased. Pottery production continued, but in the 3rd century, it reverted to being a local industry.\n\nThere were numerous potteries manufacturing terra sigillata in East Gaul, which included Alsace, the Saarland, and the Rhine and Mosel regions, but while the samian pottery from Luxeuil, La Madeleine, Chémery-Faulquemont, Lavoye, Remagen, Sinzig, Blickweiler and other sites is of interest and importance mainly to specialists, two sources stand out because their wares are often found outside their own immediate areas, namely Rheinzabern, near Speyer, and Trier.\n\nThe Trier potteries evidently began to make samian vessels around the beginning of the 2nd century AD, and were still active until the middle of the 3rd century. The styles and the potters have been divided by scholars into two main phases, Werkstatten I and II. Some of the later mould-made Dr.37 bowls are of very poor quality, with crude decoration and careless finishing.\n\nThe Rheinzabern kilns and their products have been studied since Wilhelm Ludowici (1855–1929) began to excavate there in 1901, and to publish his results in a series of detailed reports. Rheinzabern produced both decorated and plain forms for around a century from the middle of the 2nd century. Some of the Dr.37 bowls, for example those with the workshop stamp of Ianus, bear comparison with Central Gaulish products of the same date: others are less successful. But the real strength of the Rheinzabern industry lay in its extensive production of good-quality samian cups, beakers, flagons and vases, many imaginatively decorated with barbotine designs or in the 'cut-glass' incised technique. Ludowici created his own type-series, which sometimes overlaps with those of other sigillata specialists. Ludowici's types use combinations of upper- and lower-case letters rather than simple numbers, the first letter referring to the general shape, such as 'T' for \"Teller\" (dish).\n\nIn general, the products of the East Gaulish industries moved away from the early imperial Mediterranean tradition of intricately profiled dishes and cups, and ornamented bowls made in moulds, and converged with the later Roman local traditions of pottery-making in the northern provinces, using free-thrown, rounded forms and creating relief designs with freehand slip-trailing. Fashions in fine tablewares were changing. Some East Gaulish producers made bowls and cups decorated only with rouletted or stamped decoration, and in the 3rd and 4th centuries, Argonne ware, decorated with all-over patterns of small stamps, was made in the area east of Rheims and quite widely traded. Argonne ware was essentially still a type of sigillata, and the most characteristic form is a small, sturdy Dr.37 bowl. Small, localised attempts to make conventional relief-decorated samian ware included a brief and unsuccessful venture at Colchester in Britain, apparently initiated by potters from the East Gaulish factories at Sinzig, a centre that was itself an offshoot of the Trier workshops.\n\nIn the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire, there had been several industries making fine red tablewares with smooth, glossy-slipped surfaces since about the middle of the 2nd century BC, well before the rise of the Italian sigillata workshops. By the 1st century BC, their forms often paralleled Arretine plain-ware shapes quite closely. There were evidently centres of production in Syria; in western Turkey, exported through Ephesos; Pergamon; Çandarlı, near Pergamon; and on Cyprus, but archaeologists often refer to eastern sigillata A from Northern Syria, eastern sigillata B from Tralles in Asia Minor, eastern sigillata C from ancient Pitane, and eastern sigillata D (or Cypriot sigillata) from Cyprus, as there is still much to be learnt about this material. While eastern sigillata C is known to come from Çandarli (ancient Pitane), there were likely other workshops in the wider region of Pergamon. By the early 2nd century AD, when Gaulish samian was completely dominating the markets in the Northern provinces, the eastern sigillatas were themselves beginning to be displaced by the rising importance of African Red Slip wares in the Mediterranean and the Eastern Empire. In the fourth century AD, Phocaean red slip appears as a successor to Eastern sigillata C.\n\nIn the 1980s two primary groups of Eastern Terra Sigillata in the Eastern Mediterranean basin were distinguished as ETS-I and ETS-II based on their chemical fingerprints as shown by analysis by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). ETS-I originated in Eastern Cyprus, whereas the ETS-II was probably made in Pamphylia, at Perge, Aspendos and Side. However this classification has been criticized, and is not universally accepted. A potter's quarter at Sagalassos inland from the southern Turkish coast has been excavated since it was discovered in 1987, and its wares traced to many sites in the region. It was active from around 25 to 550 AD.\n\nAfrican red slip ware (ARS) was the final development of terra sigillata. While the products of the Italian and Gaulish red-gloss industries flourished and were exported from their places of manufacture for at most a century or two each, ARS production continued for more than 500 years. The centres of production were in the Roman provinces of Africa Proconsularis, Byzacena and Numidia; that is, modern Tunisia and part of eastern Algeria. From about the 4th century AD, competent copies of the fabric and forms were also made in several other regions, including Asia Minor, the eastern Mediterranean and Egypt. Over the long period of production, there was obviously much change and evolution in both forms and fabrics. Both Italian and Gaulish plain forms influenced ARS in the 1st and 2nd centuries (for example, Hayes Form 2, the cup or dish with an outcurved rim decorated with barbotine leaves, is a direct copy of the samian forms Dr.35 and 36, made in South and Central Gaul), but over time a distinctive ARS repertoire developed.\n\nThere was a wide range of dishes and bowls, many with rouletted or stamped decoration, and closed forms such as tall ovoid flagons with appliqué ornament (Hayes Form 171). The ambitious large rectangular dishes with relief decoration in the centre and on the wide rims (Hayes Form 56), were clearly inspired by decorated silver platters of the 4th century, which were made in rectangular and polygonal shapes as well as in the traditional circular form. Decorative motifs reflected not only the Graeco-Roman traditions of the Mediterranean, but eventually the rise of Christianity as well. There is a great variety of monogram crosses and plain crosses amongst the stamps.\n\nIn contrast to the archaeological usage, in which the term \"terra sigillata\" refers to a whole class of pottery, in contemporary ceramic art, 'terra sigillata' describes only a watery refined slip used to facilitate the burnishing of raw clay surfaces to promote glossy surface effects in low fire techniques, including primitive and unglazed alternative western-style Raku firing. Terra sigillata is also used as a brushable decorative colourant medium in higher temperature glazed ceramic techniques.\n\nIn 1906 the German potter Karl Fischer re-invented the method of making terra sigillata of Roman quality and obtained patent protection for this procedure at the \"Kaiserliche Patentamt\" in Berlin.\n\nModern terra sigillata is made by allowing the clay particles to separate into layers by particle size. A deflocculant such as sodium silicate is often added to the watery clay/water slip mixture to facilitate separation of fine particle flocs or aggregates. For undisturbed deflocculated slip settling in a transparent container, these layers are usually visible within 24 hours. Siphoning off the topmost layers of slip, which contain the smallest clay particles, produces terra sigillata. The remaining larger clay-particle layers are discarded.\n\nTerra sigillata is usually brushed or sprayed in thin layers onto dry or almost dry unfired ware. The ware is then burnished with a soft cloth before the water in the terra sigillata soaks into the porous body or with a hard, smooth-surfaced object . The burnished ware is fired, often to a lower temperature than normal bisque temperature of approximately 900 °C. Higher firing temperatures tend to remove the burnished effect because the clay particles start to recrystalize.\n\nSince the 18th century Samian ware pots have been found in sufficient numbers in the sea near Whitstable and Herne Bay that local people used them for cooking.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21786641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21786641", "title": "UNESCO", "text": "UNESCO\n\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO; ) is a specialized agency of the United Nations (UN) based in Paris. Its declared purpose is to contribute to peace and security by promoting international collaboration through educational, scientific, and cultural reforms in order to increase universal respect for justice, the rule of law, and human rights along with fundamental freedom proclaimed in the United Nations Charter.\nIt is the successor of the League of Nations' International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation.\n\nUNESCO has 195 member states and ten associate members. Most of its field offices are \"cluster\" offices covering three or more countries; national and regional offices also exist.\n\nUNESCO pursues its objectives through five major programs: education, natural sciences, social/human sciences, culture and communication/information. Projects sponsored by UNESCO include literacy, technical, and teacher-training programs, international science programs, the promotion of independent media and freedom of the press, regional and cultural history projects, the promotion of cultural diversity, translations of world literature, international cooperation agreements to secure the world's cultural and natural heritage (World Heritage sites) and to preserve human rights, and attempts to bridge the worldwide digital divide. It is also a member of the United Nations Development Group.\n\nUNESCO's aim is \"to contribute to the building of peace, the eradication of poverty, sustainable development and intercultural dialogue through education, the sciences, culture, communication and information\". Other priorities of the organization include attaining quality Education For All and lifelong learning, addressing emerging social and ethical challenges, fostering cultural diversity, a culture of peace and building inclusive knowledge societies through information and communication.\n\nThe broad goals and objectives of the international community—as set out in the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)—underpin all UNESCO strategies and activities.\n\nUNESCO and its mandate for international cooperation can be traced back to a League of Nations resolution on 21 September 1921, to elect a Commission to study feasibility. On 18 December 1925, the International Bureau of Education (IBE) began work as a non-governmental organization in the service of international educational development. However, the onset of World War II largely interrupted the work of these predecessor organizations.\n\nAfter the signing of the Atlantic Charter and the Declaration of the United Nations, the Conference of Allied Ministers of Education (CAME) began meetings in London which continued from 16 November 1942 to 5 December 1945. On 30 October 1943, the necessity for an international organization was expressed in the Moscow Declaration, agreed upon by China, the United Kingdom, the United States and the USSR. This was followed by the Dumbarton Oaks Conference proposals of 9 October 1944. Upon the proposal of CAME and in accordance with the recommendations of the United Nations Conference on International Organization (UNCIO), held in San Francisco in April–June 1945, a United Nations Conference for the establishment of an educational and cultural organization (ECO/CONF) was convened in London 1–16 November 1945 with 44 governments represented. The idea of UNESCO was largely developed by Rab Butler, the Minister of Education for the United Kingdom, who had a great deal of influence in its development. At the ECO/CONF, the Constitution of UNESCO was introduced and signed by 37 countries, and a Preparatory Commission was established. The Preparatory Commission operated between 16 November 1945, and 4 November 1946—the date when UNESCO's Constitution came into force with the deposit of the twentieth ratification by a member state.\n\nThe first General Conference took place from 19 November to 10 December 1946, and elected Dr. Julian Huxley to Director-General. The Constitution was amended in November 1954 when the General Conference resolved that members of the Executive Board would be representatives of the governments of the States of which they are nationals and would not, as before, act in their personal capacity. This change in governance distinguished UNESCO from its predecessor, the CICI, in how member states would work together in the organization's fields of competence. As member states worked together over time to realize UNESCO's mandate, political and historical factors have shaped the organization's operations in particular during the Cold War, the decolonization process, and the dissolution of the USSR.\n\nAmong the major achievements of the organization is its work against racism, for example through influential statements on race starting with a declaration of anthropologists (among them was Claude Lévi-Strauss) and other scientists in 1950 and concluding with the 1978 Declaration on Race and Racial Prejudice.\nIn 1956, the Republic of South Africa withdrew from UNESCO claiming that some of the organization's publications amounted to \"interference\" in the country's \"racial problems.\" South Africa rejoined the organization in 1994 under the leadership of Nelson Mandela.\n\nUNESCO's early work in the field of education included the pilot project on fundamental education in the Marbial Valley, Haiti, started in 1947.\nThis project was followed by expert missions to other countries, including, for example, a mission to Afghanistan in 1949.\nIn 1948, UNESCO recommended that Member States should make free primary education compulsory and universal.\nIn 1990, the World Conference on Education for All, in Jomtien, Thailand, launched a global movement to provide basic education for all children, youths and adults.\nTen years later, the 2000 World Education Forum held in Dakar, Senegal, led member governments to commit to achieving basic education for all by 2015.\n\nUNESCO's early activities in culture included, for example, the Nubia Campaign, launched in 1960.\nThe purpose of the campaign was to move the Great Temple of Abu Simbel to keep it from being swamped by the Nile after construction of the Aswan Dam. During the 20-year campaign, 22 monuments and architectural complexes were relocated. This was the first and largest in a series of campaigns including Mohenjo-daro (Pakistan), Fes (Morocco), Kathmandu (Nepal), Borobudur (Indonesia) and the Acropolis (Greece).\nThe organization's work on heritage led to the adoption, in 1972, of the Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage.\nThe World Heritage Committee was established in 1976 and the first sites inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1978.\nSince then important legal instruments on cultural heritage and diversity have been adopted by UNESCO member states in 2003 (Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage) and 2005 (Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions).\n\nAn intergovernmental meeting of UNESCO in Paris in December 1951 led to the creation of the European Council for Nuclear Research, which was responsible for establishing the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in 1954.\n\nArid Zone programming, 1948–1966, is another example of an early major UNESCO project in the field of natural sciences.\nIn 1968, UNESCO organized the first intergovernmental conference aimed at reconciling the environment and development, a problem which continues to be addressed in the field of sustainable development. The main outcome of the 1968 conference was the creation of UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere Programme.\n\nIn the field of communication, the \"free flow of ideas by word and image\" has been in UNESCO's constitution from its beginnings, following the experience of the Second World War when control of information was a factor in indoctrinating populations for aggression.\nIn the years immediately following World War II, efforts were concentrated on reconstruction and on the identification of needs for means of mass communication around the world. UNESCO started organizing training and education for journalists in the 1950s.\nIn response to calls for a \"New World Information and Communication Order\" in the late 1970s, UNESCO established the International Commission for the Study of Communication Problems, which produced the 1980 MacBride report (named after the Chair of the Commission, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Seán MacBride).\nThe same year, UNESCO created the International Programme for the Development of Communication (IPDC), a multilateral forum designed to promote media development in developing countries. In 1991, UNESCO's General Conference endorsed the Windhoek Declaration on media independence and pluralism, which led the UN General Assembly to declare the date of its adoption, 3 May, as World Press Freedom Day. Since 1997, UNESCO has awarded the UNESCO / Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize every 3 May. In the lead up to the World Summit on the Information Society in 2003 (Geneva) and 2005 (Tunis), UNESCO introduced the Information for All Programme.\n\nUNESCO admitted Palestine as a member in 2011.\nLaws passed in the United States in 1990 and 1994 mean that it cannot contribute financially to any UN organisation that accepts Palestine as a full member. As a result, it withdrew its funding which accounted for about 22% of UNESCO's budget. Israel also reacted to Palestine's admittance to UNESCO by freezing Israel payments to the UNESCO and imposing sanctions to the Palestinian Authority, claiming that Palestine's admittance would be detrimental \"to potential peace talks\". Two years after they stopped paying their dues to UNESCO, US and Israel lost UNESCO voting rights in 2013 without losing the right to be elected; thus, the US was elected as a member of the Executive Board for the period 2016–19.\n\nUNESCO implements its activities through the five programme areas: education, natural sciences, social and human sciences, culture, and communication and information.\nUNESCO does not accredit institutions of higher learning.\n\nThe UNESCO transparency portal has been designed to enable public access to information regarding Organization's activities, such as its aggregate budget for a biennium, as well as links to relevant programmatic and financial documents. These two distinct sets of information are published on the IATI registry, respectively based on the IATI Activity Standard and the IATI Organization Standard.\n\nThere have been proposals to establish two new UNESCO lists. The first proposed list will focus on movable cultural heritage such as artifacts, paintings, and biofacts. The list may include cultural objects, such as the Jōmon Venus of Japan, the Mona Lisa of France, the Gebel el-Arak Knife of Egypt, The Ninth Wave of Russia, the Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük of Turkey, the David (Michelangelo) of Italy, the Mathura Herakles of India, the Manunggul Jar of the Philippines, the Crown of Baekje of South Korea, The Hay Wain of the United Kingdom and the Benin Bronzes of Nigeria. The second proposed list will focus on the world's living species, such as the Komodo Dragon of Indonesia, the Panda of China, the Bald eagle of North American countries, the Aye-aye of Madagascar, the Asiatic Lion of India, the Kakapo of New Zealand, and the Mountain tapir of Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.\n\nUNESCO and its specialized institutions issue a number of magazines.\n\n\"The UNESCO Courier\" magazine states its mission to \"promote UNESCO’s ideals, maintain a platform for the dialogue between cultures and provide a forum for international debate.\" Since March 2006 it is available online, with limited printed issues. Its articles express the opinions of the authors which are not necessarily the opinions of UNESCO. There was a hiatus in publishing between 2012 and 2017.\n\nIn 1950, UNESCO initiated the quarterly review \"Impact of Science on Society\" (also known as \"Impact\") to discuss the influence of science on society. The journal ceased publication in 1992. UNESCO also published museum international quarterly from the year 1948.\n\nUNESCO has official relations with 322 international non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Most of these are what UNESCO calls \"operational\"; a select few are \"formal\".\nThe highest form of affiliation to UNESCO is \"formal associate\", and the 22 NGOs with \"formal associate\" (ASC) relations occupying offices at UNESCO are:\n\nThe institutes are specialized departments of the organization that support UNESCO's programme, providing specialized support for cluster and national offices.\n\nUNESCO awards 22 prizes in education, science, culture and peace:\n\n\nInternational Days observed at UNESCO is provided in the table given below\n\nUNESCO counts 195 member states and 10 associate members.\nSome members are not independent states and some members have additional National Organizing Committees from some of their dependent territories.\nUNESCO state parties are the United Nations member states (except Liechtenstein), Cook Islands, Niue, and the State of Palestine.\nThe USA and Israel plan to leave UNESCO on 31 December 2018 over purported anti-Israel bias.\n\nThere has been no elected UNESCO Director-General from Southeast Asia, South Asia, Central and North Asia, Middle East, North Africa, East Africa, Central Africa, South Africa, Australia-Oceania, and South America since inception.\n\nThe Director-Generals of UNESCO came from West Europe (5), Central America (1), North America (2), West Africa (1), East Asia (1), and East Europe (1). Out of the 11 Director-Generals since inception, women have held the position only twice. Qatar, the Philippines, and Iran are proposing for a Director-General bid by 2021 or 2025. There have never been a Middle Eastern or Southeast Asian UNESCO Director-General since inception. The ASEAN bloc and some Pacific and Latin American nations support the possible bid of the Philippines, which is culturally Asian, Oceanic, and Latin. Qatar and Iran, on the other hand, have fragmented support in the Middle East. Egypt, Israel, and Madagascar are also vying for the position but have yet to express a direct or indirect proposal. Both Qatar and Egypt lost in the 2017 bid against France.\n\nThe list of the Directors-General of UNESCO since its establishment in 1946 is as follows:\n\nThis is the list of the sessions of the UNESCO General Conference held since 1946:\n\nUNESCO headquarters are located at Place de Fontenoy in Paris, France.\n\nUNESCO's field offices across the globe are categorized into four primary office types based upon their function and geographic coverage: cluster offices, national offices, regional bureaus and liaison offices.\n\nThe following list of all UNESCO Field Offices is organized geographically by UNESCO Region and identifies the members states and associate members of UNESCO which are served by each office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUNESCO has been the centre of controversy in the past, particularly in its relationships with the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore and the former Soviet Union. During the 1970s and 1980s, UNESCO's support for a \"New World Information and Communication Order\" and its MacBride report calling for democratization of the media and more egalitarian access to information was condemned in these countries as attempts to curb freedom of the press. UNESCO was perceived as a platform for communists and Third World dictators to attack the West, in contrast to accusations made by the USSR in the late 1940s and early 1950s. In 1984, the United States withheld its contributions and withdrew from the organization in protest, followed by the United Kingdom in 1985. Singapore withdrew also at the end of 1985, citing rising membership fees. Following a change of government in 1997, the UK rejoined. The United States rejoined in 2003, followed by Singapore on 8 October 2007.\n\nIsrael was admitted to UNESCO in 1949, one year after its creation. Israel has maintained its membership since 1949.\nIn 2010, Israel designated the Cave of the Patriarchs, Hebron and Rachel's Tomb, Bethlehem as National Heritage Sites and announced restoration work, prompting criticism from the United States and protests from Palestinians. In October 2010, UNESCO's Executive Board voted to declare the sites as \"al-Haram al-Ibrahimi/Tomb of the Patriarchs\" and \"Bilal bin Rabah Mosque/Rachel's Tomb\" and stated that they were \"an integral part of the occupied Palestinian Territories\" and any unilateral Israeli action was a violation of international law.\nUNESCO described the sites as significant to \"people of the Muslim, Christian and Jewish traditions\", and accused Israel of highlighting only the Jewish character of the sites.\nIsrael in turn accused UNESCO of \"detach[ing] the Nation of Israel from its heritage\", and accused it of being politically motivated.\nThe Rabbi of the Western Wall claimed that Rachel's tomb had not previously been declared a holy Muslim site. Israel partially suspended ties with UNESCO. Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon declared that the resolution was a \"part of Palestinian escalation\".\nZevulun Orlev, chairman of the Knesset Education and Culture Committee, referred to the resolutions as an attempt to undermine the mission of UNESCO as a scientific and cultural organization that promotes cooperation throughout the world.\n\nOn 28 June 2011, UNESCO's World Heritage Committee, at Jordan's insistence, censured Israel's decision to demolish and rebuild the Mughrabi Gate Bridge in Jerusalem for safety reasons. Israel stated that Jordan had signed an agreement with Israel stipulating that the existing bridge must be dismantled for safety reasons; Jordan disputed the agreement, saying that it was only signed under U.S. pressure. Israel was also unable to address the UNESCO committee over objections from Egypt.\n\nIn January 2014, days before it was scheduled to open, UNESCO Director-General, Irina Bokova, \"indefinitely postponed\" and effectively cancelled an exhibit created by the Simon Wiesenthal Center entitled \"The People, The Book, The Land: The 3,500-year relationship between the Jewish people and the Land of Israel.\" The event was scheduled to run from 21 January through 30 January in Paris. Bokova cancelled the event after representatives of Arab states at UNESCO argued that its display would \"harm the peace process\". The author of the exhibition, Professor Robert Wistrich of the Hebrew University's Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Anti-Semitism, called the cancellation an \"appalling act,\" and characterized Bokova's decision as \"an arbitrary act of total cynicism and, really, contempt for the Jewish people and its history.\" UNESCO amended the decision to cancel the exhibit within the year, and it quickly achieved popularity and was viewed as a great success.\n\nOn 13 October 2016, UNESCO passed a resolution on East Jerusalem that condemned Israel for \"aggressions\" by Israeli police and soldiers and \"illegal measures\" against the freedom of worship and Muslims' access to their holy sites, while also recognizing Israel as the occupying power. Palestinian leaders welcomed the decision. While the text acknowledged the \"importance of the Old City of Jerusalem and its walls for the three monotheistic religions\", it referred to the sacred hilltop compound in Jerusalem's Old City only by its Muslim name \"Al-Haram al-Sharif\", Arabic for Noble Sanctuary. In response, Israel denounced the UNESCO resolution for its omission of the words \"Temple Mount\" or \"Har HaBayit,\" stating that it denies Jewish ties to the key holy site. After receiving criticism from numerous Israeli politicians and diplomats, including Benjamin Netanyahu and Ayelet Shaked, Israel froze all ties with the organization. The resolution was condemned by Ban ki-Moon and the Director-General of UNESCO, Irina Bokova, who said that Judaism, Islam and Christianity have clear historical connections to Jerusalem and \"to deny, conceal or erase any of the Jewish, Christian or Muslim traditions undermines the integrity of the site. Al-Aqsa Mosque is also Temple Mount, whose Western Wall is the holiest place in Judaism.\" It was also rejected by the Czech Parliament which said the resolution reflects a \"hateful anti-Israel sentiment\", and hundreds of Italian Jews demonstrated in Rome over Italy's abstention. On 26 October, UNESCO approved a reviewed version of the resolution, which also criticized Israel for its continuous \"refusal to let the body's experts access Jerusalem's holy sites to determine their conservation status.\" Despite containing some softening of language following Israeli protests over a previous version, Israel continued to denounce the text. The resolution refers to the site Jews and Christians refer to as the Temple Mount, or Har HaBayit in Hebrew, only by its Arab name — a significant semantic decision also adopted by UNESCO's executive board, triggering condemnation from Israel and its allies. U.S. Ambassador Crystal Nix Hines stated: \"This item should have been defeated. These politicized and one-sided resolutions are damaging the credibility of UNESCO.\"\n\nIn October 2017, the United States and Israel announced they would withdraw from the organization, citing in-part anti-Israel bias.\n\nIn February 2011, an article was published in a Palestinian youth magazine in which a teenage girl described one of her four role-models as Adolf Hitler. In December 2011, UNESCO, which partly funded the magazine, condemned the material and subsequently withdrew support.\n\nIn 2012, UNESCO decided to establish a chair at the Islamic University of Gaza in the field of astronomy, astrophysics, and space sciences, fueling controversy and criticism. Israel bombed the school in 2008 claiming they develop and store weapons there, a claim Israel restated in criticizing UNESCO's move.\n\nThe head, Kamalain Shaath, defended UNESCO, stating that \"the Islamic University is a purely academic university that is interested only in education and its development\". Israeli ambassador to UNESCO Nimrod Barkan planned to submit a letter of protest with information about the university's ties to Hamas, especially angry that this was the first Palestinian university that UNESCO chose to cooperate with. The Jewish organization B'nai B'rith criticized the move as well.\n\nOn 16 and 17 February 2012, UNESCO held a conference entitled \"The Media World after WikiLeaks and News of the World.\" Despite all six panels being focused on WikiLeaks, no member of WikiLeaks staff was invited to speak. After receiving a complaint from WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson, UNESCO invited him to attend, but did not offer a place on any panels. The offer also came only a week before the conference, which was held in Paris, France. Many of the speakers featured, including David Leigh and Heather Brooke, had spoken out openly against WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange in the past. WikiLeaks released a press statement on 15 February 2012 denouncing UNESCO which stated, \"UNESCO has made itself an international human rights joke. To use 'freedom of expression' to censor WikiLeaks from a conference about WikiLeaks is an Orwellian absurdity beyond words.\"\n\nIn 2013, UNESCO announced that the collection \"The Life and Works of Ernesto Che Guevara\" became part of the Memory of the World Register. US Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen condemned this decision, saying that the organization acts against its own ideals:\n\nUN Watch also condemned this selection by UNESCO.\n\nIn 2015, Japan threatened to halt funding for UNESCO over the organization's decision to include documents relating to the 1937 Nanjing massacre in the latest listing for its \"Memory of the World\" program.\nIn October 2016, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida confirmed that Japan's 2016 annual funding of ¥4.4 billion had been suspended although denied any direct link with the Nanjing document controversy.\n\nAfter withdrawing from UNESCO in 1984, the United States rejoined January 10, 2003. Former U.S. Congressman Jim Leach stated before a Congressional subcommittee:\nHe concluded that the record showed Israel bashing, a call for a new world information order, money management, and arms control policy to be the impetus behind the withdrawal; he asserted that before the UNESCO withdrawal, a withdrawal from the IAEA had been pushed on him. The United States rejoined UNESCO shortly thereafter.\n\nOn 12 October 2017, the United States notified UNESCO that it will again withdraw from the organization on 31 December 2018 and will seek to establish a permanent observer mission beginning in 2019. The Department of State cited \"mounting arrears at UNESCO, the need for fundamental reform in the organization, and continuing anti-Israel bias at UNESCO.\"\n\nThe United States has not paid its $80 million annual UNESCO dues since Palestine became a full member in 2011. Israel and the US were among only 14 votes against the membership, of 194 member countries.\n\nOn May 25, 2016, the noted Turkish poet and human rights activist Zülfü Livaneli resigned as Turkey’s only UNESCO goodwill ambassador. He highlighted human rights situation in Turkey and destruction of historical Sur district of Diyarbakir, the largest city in Kurdish-majority southeast Turkey, during fighting between the Turkish army and Kurdish militants as the main reasons for his resignation. Livaneli said: \"To pontificate on peace while remaining silent against such violations is a contradiction of the fundamental ideals of UNESCO.\"\n\n\nUNESCO develops, maintains and disseminates, free of charge, two interrelated software packages for database management (CDS/ISIS [not to be confused with UK police software package ISIS]) and data mining/statistical analysis (IDAMS).\n\n"}

{"id": "48765193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48765193", "title": "Women in Animation", "text": "Women in Animation\n\nWomen in Animation (WIA) is a non-profit organization with the purpose of furthering, promoting, and supporting female animators in the art, science and business of animation. WIA has chapters in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York City, Dublin, Pune, and Toronto. WIA feels that the lack of an equal number of women and men in the animation profession is because \"there has been very little work to intentionally change the status quo.\" In order to help women enter the animation profession, WIA has created a mentorship program, a voice over group, a scholarship, talks, and events. Marge Dean is the current co-president of WIA along with Kristy Scanlan.\n\nWIA was formed in 1993 by producer and journalist Rita Street. Phyllis Craig was one of the founding members. WIA created a scholarship to honor Craig after her death in 1997. Dean and Scanlan took over as co-presidents of WIA in 2013. Since 2013, the membership of WIA has increased from 120 to 800 active members in January 2015.\n\nAlthough female animators have come a long way from the time when Disney sent out rejection letters stating “Women do not do any of the creative work in connection with preparing the cartoons for the screen, as that work is performed entirely by young men”, the climate shift within the animation industry is progressing very slowly. Back in the days, women were mostly employed as inkers by Disney, it wasn’t until 1941with the outbreak of war, that Disney started training females technically in animation to maintain a pool of worker while the men have all gone to war. Today according to Los Angeles Magazine, 70% of animation students from CalArts Valencia campus are female, 66% of animation students from UCLA and 55% of animation students from USC are all female. Despite the rapidly growing female population studying animation, industry statistics still reflect poorly and far from achieving gender parity. The Animation Guild, I.A.T.S.E. Local 839, is a union representing over 4000 animation artists, writers and technician in Los Angeles. Based on its data, in 2015, 20.6% of Guild workers were women, the number increased to 23.2% in 2016, and finally hit the quarter milestone 25.6% in 2018. While there appears to be uprising number of female professionals in the industry, a closer look into 2015 statistics in key areas of animation shows only 1% of women were art directors, 3% were directors and 5% were writers. With the discouraging disparity, Women in Animation, has initiated the movement “50/50 by 2025”. The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, another non-profit devoted to research in gender representation in Media constantly keep tracks of the number of female characters in animated films. Hopefully with continue efforts the animation industry will soon close the gender disparity gap and give young talented female animators the opportunities they deserve.\n\nWIA has hosted over 100 events. Examples of some of the events hosted by WIA include: \"WIA Conversations\" (Tara Strong gave this talk on Nov. 19, 2015), \"Voices in the Room\", \"The WIA Mentorship Experience\", as well as many other kinds of events and talks. WIA also has hosted movie screenings, panels, workshops, and \"Monthly Networking Mixers\".\n\nIn 2014, WIA kicked off its first mentoring program, which was open to members of WIA in the Los Angeles area. The mentoring program has continued into the present. The program is intended to help mentees have greater \"industry knowledge and access to information through relationships with experienced professionals.\n\nWIA hosts various activities and efforts aimed at raising awareness of women in the animation industry. In 2015, WIA hosted a panel on women in animation, presenting such statistics as while 60% of students studying animation in several Los Angeles animation schools are women, only 20% of working animators are content creators, rather than support staff.\n\nOn November 22, 2015, WIA had a booth and a talk at CTN. People interested in WIA signed their names on a huge poster featuring their logo behind their booth. Floyd Norman also showed his support for WIA by signing his name on the poster. The subject of the discussion of the talk at CTN was “50/50 by 2025” (#5050by2025) which discussed the subject of getting the ratio of female to male animators working in the industry to 50% (equal) by the year 2025. Another goal of 50/50 by 2025 is to \"bring about more varied and positive representations on screen.\"\n\nPhyllis Craig was the founding member of WIA. Her death inspired the creation of an annual $1,000 scholarship fund in her honor. Craig was, “... known throughout the animation industry for her commitment to young people interested in learning the art and techniques of animation\". The deadline for the scholarship is April 29, of each year (Craig's birthday).\n"}
