It has been placed on various kinds of merchandise after the phrase became popular, as well as gained criticism from various entities. The use of the term in Boston has led to similar phrases entering public discourse, such as America Strong.\n\nIn the hours after the Boston Marathon bombing on April 15, 2013, the slogan \"Boston Strong\" appeared as a highly popular hashtag on Twitter and rapidly spread around the world. It was a T-shirt campaign created by Christopher Dobens and Nicholas Reynolds, students at Emerson College. An expression of Boston's unity after the bombings, the slogan showed up on T-shirts and other products, and was emblazoned on the \"Green Monster\" wall at Boston's Fenway Park. The Boston Bruins displayed the slogan on their helmets at their game two days after the bombings, and at the first baseball game in Fenway Park after the bombings, the stadium announcer told the crowd: \"We are one. We are strong. We are Boston. We are Boston strong.\"\n\nOn April 17, two days after the bombings, a T-shirt vendor and another private individual submitted separate trademark registration applications to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, seeking to obtain ownership of the \"Boston Strong\" slogan for use on commercial products. One of the applicants said he wanted the trademark in order to prevent people from outside the Boston area from benefiting from it. A trademark attorney was quoted in \"The Huffington Post\" as predicting that the government office would deny the registration on the grounds that the slogan was already in the public domain and could not be linked to any specific entity.\n\nOn July 17, 2013, Boston Strong Bostonstrong.com LLC submitted trademark application to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the first for \"Charitable Fundraising to Support Disaster Relief\", and failed to receive registration in April 2014.

{"id": "39562051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39562051", "title": "Carol (film)", "text": "Carol (film)\n\nCarol is a 2015 drama film directed by Todd Haynes. The screenplay, written by Phyllis Nagy, is based on the 1952 romance novel \"The Price of Salt\" by Patricia Highsmith (republished as \"Carol\" in 1990). The film stars Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara, Sarah Paulson, Jake Lacy, and Kyle Chandler. Set in New York City during the early 1950s, \"Carol\" tells the story of a forbidden affair between an aspiring female photographer and an older woman going through a difficult divorce.\n\n\"Carol\" had been in development since 1997, when Nagy wrote the first draft of the screenplay. British company Film4 Productions and its then-chief executive Tessa Ross financed development. The film had a troubled development period, facing problems with financing, rights, scheduling conflicts, and accessibility. Number 9 Films came on board as a producer in 2011, when Elizabeth Karlsen secured the rights to the novel. The film is co-produced by New York-based Killer Films, which joined the project in 2013 after Haynes's collaborator Christine Vachon approached him to direct. Principal photography on the British-American production began in March 2014, in Cincinnati, Ohio, and lasted 34 days. Cinematographer Edward Lachman shot \"Carol\" on Super 16 mm film.\n\n\"Carol\" competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, where Mara tied for the Best Actress award. The film received many accolades, including five Golden Globe Award nominations, six Academy Award nominations, and nine BAFTA Award nominations; as well as five Dorian Awards and awards from the New York Film Critics Circle, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, and National Society of Film Critics. It became the best reviewed film of 2015, as calculated by Metacritic. The film premiered in the United Kingdom on October 14, 2015, followed by theatrical release on November 27, 2015. It opened in limited release in the United States on November 20, 2015, and wide release on January 15, 2016.\n\nDuring the Christmas season of 1952, aspiring photographer Therese Belivet is working in Frankenberg's department store in Manhattan. She meets a glamorous woman, Carol Aird, who is searching for a doll for her daughter Rindy. At Therese's recommendation, Carol purchases a model train set. When Carol departs she leaves her gloves on the counter. Therese mails them to her using Frankenberg's sales slip with Carol's name and address.\n\nTherese's boyfriend, Richard, wants her to go to France with him, hoping they will marry, but she is ambivalent about their relationship. A mutual friend, Dannie, invites Therese to his workplace, \"The New York Times\", and offers to introduce her to a photo editor friend. Meanwhile, Carol is going through a difficult divorce from her neglectful husband, Harge. Carol calls Frankenberg's to thank the clerk who returned the gloves, and invites Therese to lunch. Therese visits Dannie and he kisses her, but she becomes uncomfortable and leaves.\n\nCarol invites Therese to her home in New Jersey. She stops to purchase a Christmas tree, and Therese takes candid photographs of her. Harge arrives unexpectedly to take Rindy to Florida for Christmas; he becomes suspicious of Therese as Carol had an affair years before with her friend Abby. Therese witnesses their argument. After Rindy leaves, a distressed Carol takes Therese to the train station so she can return home.\n\nCarol calls to apologize and they meet at Therese's apartment, where Carol surprises her with a suitcase containing a gift of a Canon camera and film. Carol has learned that Harge is petitioning the judge to consider a \"morality clause\" against her, threatening to expose her homosexuality and give him full custody of Rindy. She decides to take a road trip to escape the stress of the divorce proceedings and invites Therese to join her. Richard accuses Therese of being infatuated with Carol, and predicts Carol will soon tire of her. The two argue and their relationship comes to an end. On the second night of the trip, Therese meets a traveling salesman, Tommy Tucker.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, Carol and Therese kiss for the first time and have sex. The next morning, they discover that Tucker is actually a private investigator hired by Harge to obtain evidence against Carol. Carol confronts Tucker, threatening him at gunpoint, but he claims to have already sent the tape recordings to Harge. Carol and Therese turn back. The following day, in Chicago, Therese learns that Carol has flown home to fight for custody of her daughter, having asked Abby to drive Therese home. Abby gives her a letter from Carol. Back at home, Therese telephones Carol, but knowing that she risks losing custody of Rindy if she continues her relationship with Therese, Carol hangs up.\n\nTherese creates a portfolio of her photographs and gets a job at \"The New York Times\". In the meantime, Carol has been seeing a psychotherapist as a condition of the divorce settlement. During a confrontational meeting in mid-April with divorce lawyers, Carol suddenly admits to the truth of what the tapes contain, and refuses to deny her sexuality. She tells Harge that he can have custody, but demands regular visitation even if it has to be supervised.\n\nCarol writes to Therese, and they meet in the lounge of the Ritz Tower Hotel. Carol reveals she is going to work for a furniture house, and has taken an apartment on Madison Avenue. Therese declines Carol's invitation to live with her. Carol tells Therese that she is meeting associates in the Oak Room, and that if she changes her mind they can have dinner. Therese remains still and Carol whispers \"I love you.\" They are interrupted by Jack, a colleague who has not seen Therese in months, and Carol departs.\n\nTherese accepts Jack's ride to a party, but finds that she cannot connect with anyone. Therese heads to the Oak Room. She scans the diners and sees Carol at a table. Therese hesitates, before walking towards Carol. Their eyes meet. Carol gazes at Therese with a smile that slowly grows.\n\n\"Carol\" is based on Patricia Highsmith's 1952 semi-autobiographical romantic novel \"The Price of Salt\". The book was originally published under the pseudonym \"Claire Morgan\" by Coward-McCann after Highsmith's publisher Harper & Brothers rejected it. In 1990, Highsmith agreed to republish with Bloomsbury Publishing under her own name, and retitled it \"Carol\". It had been inspired by an encounter in 1948 between Highsmith and a blonde woman wearing a mink coat, Mrs. E.R. Senn (Kathleen Wiggins Senn), whilst she was working as a Christmas season salesgirl at the toy department of Bloomingdale's in New York. That evening she wrote an eight-page outline, which she developed some weeks later and had completed by 1951. The character of Therese Belivet was based on Highsmith herself. Senn inspired the character of Carol Aird, but its template was inspired by her relationships with two former lovers, Philadelphia socialite Virginia Kent Catherwood and psychoanalyst Kathryn Hamill Cohen. Virginia Catherwood lost custody of her daughter in a high-profile divorce that involved secret tape recordings of her and her female lover.\n\nLondon-born, New York-based producer Dorothy Berwin was initially attached to the project in 1996, owning the rights to the novel. She enlisted then-playwright Phyllis Nagy to write the screenplay on the recommendation of her London agent. Nagy, who was a friend of Highsmith, wrote the first draft of the script in 1997. Highsmith had suggested to Nagy that she adapt one of her novels. According to Nagy, Highsmith was not confident that the novel could be made into a \"satisfying\" film because of its \"intense, subjective point of view\". Nagy decided to adapt the script to ensure its fidelity to the source material, remarking, \"I felt a strange responsibility to take it, and to make sure that it wasn't screwed up in some fundamental way, because she so disliked many of the screen adaptations of her work.\"\n\nWhile searching for investors, Nagy and Berwin learned that the homosexuality of the characters was not as much of an obstacle as was that they were women. \"Having two women leads was the issue\", Nagy noted. In 2015, Berwin said that, in those days, it was a risky idea to play the role of Carol. \"As a project it came together with Cate Blanchett. You needed to always start with her role\". Film4 Productions and Tessa Ross financed the development of the film and kept it alive through the years, as it \"underwent a decade-plus of revision under various directors and investors\" − including Hettie MacDonald, Kenneth Branagh, Kimberly Peirce, John Maybury, and Stephen Frears − until the project completely stalled. The long delay was a result of struggles with funding, rights, and trepidations about a film with a gay theme and two female leads. \"During its development, there was a very different kind of lesbian or gay movie that got financed\", Nagy said. \"They were very agenda or issue driven, and this was not. In fact it insists on not being that in order to make the point. I would talk about that with financiers, and I could see them glaze over.\"\n\nNagy said it was important that the screenplay be authentic to the early 1950s. \"There was a different protocol then, a different etiquette, a different way people related to each other physically\", she said. \"It does you no service to spoon-feed a contemporary audience their own emotional codes and value systems.\" While various directors and investors had input to the script throughout its long gestation period, Nagy rejected suggestions that Carol or Therese \"should feel guilty about being gay and suffer some kind of breakdown scene about it.\" \"What I knew going in to the adaptation\", Nagy said, \"was that Pat's lack of psychologizing about Carol and Therese's sexual attraction and ultimately their love, had to be maintained. It could not be corrupted by an impulse to indulge in any number of dramatic narrative cliches about guilt concerning one's sexuality or the like.\"\n\nNagy set the adaptation several years later than when the novel is set, so that \"the dawn of the Eisenhower administration and the rise of HUAC could be front and center\". One of the challenges was translating the subjective and limited third-person viewpoint, where the narrator \"sits on the shoulder of Therese and makes regular advances into (and retreats from) her head\"; Carol is thus largely seen through Therese's fanatical prism. Nagy was initially apprehensive about the narrative structure, considering \"there's no character of Carol. She's a ghost appropriately, as she should be, in the novel\", adding that she was \"overwhelmed by the task of trying to come up with the visual equivalent for it structurally.\" She decided to split the point of view and shift perspectives from Therese to Carol, as \"the point of view is always with the more vulnerable party\". She made Therese a photographer instead of a set designer, allowing her \"to be seen moving from objects to people\", which she likened to Highsmith as Therese is a \"clear stand-in\" for the author. Nagy drew from her personal knowledge of Highsmith for Therese, describing one of Therese's lines, \"I started taking pictures of people because my friend says I have to be more interested in humans\", as the epitome of Highsmith: \"that ability to step outside of life and comment on it before participating in it\". For the character of Carol, she took inspiration from Grace Kelly's character in \"Rear Window\" (1954). Nagy had freedom in \"inventing a life for [Carol], for whom, basically, we knew the outline of what was going on.\" Once she was able to understand the inner life of Carol, and her motivations, the character became easy to write. Nagy aimed to \"focus on the nature of what it's like to fall in love from two points of view\", and show the characters \"just behaving ... not inhabiting positions.\"\n\nNagy realized she would \"pass time in a different way\" to the novel, eliminating elements that were unnecessary and slowed down the story. She had \"great freedom\" developing the screenplay in England, while no studio or director was attached. Over the years, five \"proper\" drafts materialized. Nagy said that after all the previous collaborations, \"working for Todd was easy and quick. We both have an interest in restraint.\" Haynes and Nagy collaborated on honing the screenplay. When Haynes came on board they had discussions about \"what became the framing device\"; the story reminded Haynes of the 1945 classic film \"Brief Encounter\", and he proposed using a similar technique, which Nagy \"then ran with in a certain way\". \"He was interested in the same things, tonally, that the script was interested in\", she noted. \"We were able to keep that restraint going\". Nagy made the story more enigmatic, pruning some of the backstory in light of a significant early line that Carol says to Therese: \"What a strange girl you are, flung out of space.\" Nagy and Haynes were determined not to make \"an agenda film\" or a \"look how far we've come\" film.\n\nAt the London Film Festival, Nagy said she had titled the film \"Carol\", and not \"The Price of Salt\", because Highsmith herself had changed the title to \"Carol\" when the novel was republished, and she also \"liked the sort of strange, obsessive nature of calling it by someone's name.\" Haynes said that the film is called \"Carol\" because the novel \"is locked into the subjectivity of the younger woman\" and Carol is \"really the object of desire in the story.\" \"There's an element of, something aloof ... something unsettled about [her], that puts Therese and these new feelings ... on edge throughout much of the film\" On the universal theme of the story, Haynes said \"the real determining question is not whether society will accept [Therese's] feelings or not; it's, will this person return her love or not? ... That is what transcends the class of love, or the period in which it's occurring, and makes it something that just humbles us all and levels us all.\"\n\nBritish producer Elizabeth Karlsen of Number 9 Films came across Nagy's script in around 2004, when she was co-producing \"Mrs. Harris\" with Christine Vachon of New York-based Killer Films. Berwin's rights to \"The Price of Salt\" expired in 2010, and Karlsen thereafter acquired the script. Berwin remained an executive producer on the film. Karlsen managed to convince Highsmith's estate to sign over the rights, closing the deal with Tessa Ross in late 2011. She then persuaded a disillusioned and reluctant Nagy to come back on board. The producers hired a UK director, who then dropped out because of scheduling conflicts. They later recruited Irish director John Crowley, who was announced in May 2012 along with the lead cast, Cate Blanchett and Mia Wasikowska, and the involved producers, Karlsen and Stephen Woolley of Number 9 Films and Tessa Ross of Film4, who received executive producer credit. \"Carol\" was scheduled to commence filming in early 2013, until Crowley withdrew due to a scheduling conflict. Karlsen called Vachon to discuss their losing another director, and Vachon told her that Haynes's new film was not going to happen because its star had also backed out. They then decided to approach Haynes. Vachon, Haynes's frequent collaborator, asked if he would be interested, and he received a copy of the screenplay. Two days later he committed to direct, and Vachon joined as a producer. Haynes was announced as director on May 22, 2013. Three days later, The Weinstein Company acquired U.S. distribution rights at the Cannes Film Festival from HanWay Films.\n\nHaynes had first heard about the film in 2012 from costume designer Sandy Powell, who informed him that Blanchett was attached and that Karlsen was producing. Blanchett, who served as an executive producer through her company Dirty Films, had been involved with the project for \"a long time\". Haynes learned that they were looking for a director when Vachon approached him in 2013. He regarded the story, its historical and social context, and collaborating again with Blanchett, as motivations to get involved. \"What was so interesting to me when I first read this script\", he said, \"is how it basically links that hothouse mentality of the desiring subject ... to that of the criminal subject, in that both are these over-productive minds that are conjuring narratives constantly ... this crazy state of this furtive hyperactivity in the mind.\" Haynes collaborated with Blanchett on a dramaturgical level.\n\nAnother complication emerged when Wasikowska had to drop out because of a scheduling conflict. Haynes then approached Rooney Mara, who had been offered the role of Therese after completing the 2011 film \"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\". She said that although she loved the script and wanted to work with Blanchett, she had turned it down as she felt exhausted and unconfident. By the time Haynes came on board she was \"in a much different head space\" and signing on was then \"a no brainer\". In August 2013, it was reported that Mara had replaced Wasikowska. Sarah Paulson was cast as Abby and Kyle Chandler as Harge in January 2014. The following month, Cory Michael Smith was cast as Tommy, and Jake Lacy as Richard. In April 2014, John Magaro was cast as Dannie. Carrie Brownstein then joined the cast in the role of Genevieve Cantrell. Carter Burwell was hired to compose the music, and Edward Lachman, who had previously collaborated with Haynes, served as the director of photography.\n\nIn rehearsal, Haynes, Blanchett and Mara realized that certain lines should be cut, which Haynes deemed the \"stylistic practice that we all took throughout the creative departments. I feel there was an understanding with them that words and dialogue were never carrying the weight of the story.\" Costume Designer Sandy Powell said of working with Haynes, \"Todd is super visual, super prepared and he provides his own visuals at the beginning of the film. He starts with a look book of images that he's compiled over the months and months. He's almost OCD about it. In a good way.\" The look of the film was influenced by the post-war color photography of Ruth Orkin, Esther Bubley, Helen Levitt, and Vivian Maier, as well as the abstract photography of Saul Leiter. Haynes used their works as a visual reference for depicting a \"dirty and sagging\" New York.\n\nIn preparing for filming, the producers found that the cost of production in the New York City area would be prohibitive, and it was also going to be difficult to find locations there that resembled the early 1950s. Part of the financing plan hinged upon a co-production deal with Canada, with filming taking place in Montreal, but Haynes joining the production led to a rethink. Karlsen recalled making a film 27 years earlier in Cincinnati, Ohio, that was set in 1950s New York. After researching the city, she found that it had not changed much in decades, with Ohio also having one of the best film tax incentives in the U.S. The city of Cincinnati was very accommodating to the production, which employed many locals as crew.\n\nIn December 2013, it was announced that \"Carol\" would be filmed in Cincinnati, Ohio, and that production offices would open in early January 2014 with filming expected between mid-March and May. In February 2014, the Greater Cincinnati & Northern Kentucky Film Commission released the solicitation from producers for extras and vintage vehicles. Principal photography began on March 12, 2014, at Eden Park in Cincinnati. Various locations around Cincinnati were used during production, including Downtown Cincinnati, Hyde Park, Over-the-Rhine, Wyoming, Cheviot, and Hamilton, as well as Alexandria, Kentucky. Except for the Waterloo, Iowa, motel room, which was a private set built for filming the love scene, locations were used for interior and exterior settings. The second floor of a now-defunct department store served as the setting for the toy department of the fictional Frankenberg's. Filming was completed after 34 days on May 2, 2014. Edward Lachman shot \"Carol\" on Super 16 mm film using 35 mm format lenses.\n\nPost-production in New York took seven months to complete. Haynes was involved in the editing process alongside editor Affonso Gonçalves. Visual effects (VFX) were used to remove modern components from backgrounds, with six \"key shots\" needing extensive VFX. Moving shots were particularly complicated when they were filtered through windows, rain, dust, and other elements, said Haynes, and the CGI details \"had to fit exactly into the vernacular itself, with the grain element and level of distress.\" The digital intermediate process was used to achieve a \"very specific, slightly spoiled palette\". Haynes spent five and a half weeks making detailed notes on Gonçalves's assembly edit, and produced his director's cut within four weeks. The producers gave notes on the director's cut, and held some test screenings with friends and acquaintances. They decided to show the cut to Harvey Weinstein, who was impressed and endorsed it.\n\nHaynes confirmed the completion of deliverables on December 15, 2014. Carrie Brownstein stated that the first cut was extensive and most of her scenes were left out. In November 2015, Sarah Paulson said that a key scene between Abby and Therese, and some conversation in a scene with Carol, had been cut. In January 2016, Rooney Mara said that an intimate scene between Therese and Richard had also been deleted. Gonçalves said that the initial cut was at two and a half hours, and the final cut ended at 118 minutes. Haynes explained in an October 2015 interview: \"We cut a lot of scenes; it was too long, and they were all well-performed and nicely shot—we never, in my opinion, cut things because they were poorly executed. It was just a paring-down process, which all movies do.\"\n\nThe soundtrack was released in both digital download and CD album format by Varèse Sarabande on November 20, 2015, followed by a double album vinyl release on June 24, 2016. It includes the original score by Carter Burwell and additional music by The Clovers, Billie Holiday, Georgia Gibbs, Les Paul and Mary Ford, and Jo Stafford. Songs not featured on the CD include \"Willow Weep for Me\" performed by Vince Giordano & the Nighthawks Orchestra, \"Perdido\" by Woody Herman, and \"That's the Chance You Take\" by Eddie Fisher. \"A Garden in the Rain\" by The Four Aces, \"Slow Poke\" by Pee Wee King, and \"Why Don't You Believe Me\" by Patti Page are also not included, but appear in the vinyl version.\n\nThe first official image from \"Carol\", released by Film4, appeared in the \"London Evening Standard\" in May 2014. Despite being completed in late 2014, producers withheld the film until 2015 to benefit from a film festival launch. In October 2014, Haynes and Vachon announced that it would premiere in the spring of 2015, and be released in the fall.\n\n\"Carol\" had its world premiere at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. It made its North American debut at the Telluride Film Festival on September 4, and screened at the New York Film Festival on October 9, 2015. The film premiered in the United Kingdom at the BFI London Film Festival's Gala event on October 14, 2015.\n\nOriginally scheduled for a December 18 release in the United States, \"Carol\" opened in limited release on November 20, 2015.

The film went into wide release on January 15, 2016. \"Carol\" was released nationwide in the UK on November 27, 2015.\n\nIn December 2015, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" said that Russian distributor Arthouse had acquired rights to release the film in Russia in March 2016. Its CEO stated that it was \"a huge challenge because of the federal 'gay propaganda' law that victimizes the Russian LGBT community\", that \"will prevent \"Carol\" [being] sold to major TV channels or even being advertised on federal networks\". He noted that \"some cinemas will refuse to book the film\", but \"the controversy ... will help us market \"Carol\" to the right audience\", adding that he believed it would \"appeal to the public way beyond the LGBT community.\" It was released in Russia on March 10, 2016.\n\nIn March 2016, a 35 mm film screening was held at the . The Metrograph independent cinema in New York hosted a special 35 mm screening event, followed by a Q&A with Haynes, Vachon and Lachman. The event was sold out, and a second and third screening were added.\n\n\"Carol\" was made available for digital download on March 4, 2016. The film was released on DVD, Blu-ray and video on demand on March 15, 2016 in the United States by Anchor Bay Entertainment, and on March 21, 2016 in the United Kingdom by StudioCanal. Disc format bonus features include a behind the scenes gallery, a Q&A interview with the cast and filmmakers, and (for the UK version) limited edition art cards. , both the DVD and Blu-ray were Number Seven in pre-order sales in the United States; followed by ranking Number 18 in retail sales the week of commercial release.

The film became available for streaming on Netflix on September 20, 2017.\n\n\"Carol\" received a ten-minute standing ovation at its Cannes Film Festival international press screening and premiere. Critics praised Haynes's direction, Blanchett and Mara's performances, cinematography, costumes and musical score, and deemed it a strong contender for a Cannes award. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 95% rating based on reviews from 283 critics, and an average rating of 8.6/10. The website's critical consensus states: \"Shaped by Todd Haynes' deft direction and powered by a strong cast led by Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, \"Carol\" lives up to its groundbreaking source material.\" \"Carol\" was named the best-reviewed romance film of 2015 in Rotten Tomatoes' annual Golden Tomato Awards. On Metacritic, the film received a score of 95 (out of 100) based on 44 reviews from mainstream critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\", and is its best reviewed film of 2015.\n\nKate Stables wrote in \"Sight & Sound\": \"Elegant restraint is the film's watchword ... In this enjoyably deliberate film, each shot and scene is carefully composed to pay homage to 50s cinema, yet infused with an emotional ambiguity which feels decidedly contemporary.\" Kenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" said it was \"a serious melodrama about the geometry of desire, a dreamy example of heightened reality that fully engages emotions despite the exact calculations with which it's been made... 'Carol's' lush but controlled visual look is completely intoxicating. This is filmmaking done by masters, an experience to savor.\" A.O. Scott wrote in \"The New York Times\": \"At once ardent and analytical, cerebral and swooning, 'Carol' is a study in human magnetism, in the physics and optics of eros. With sparse dialogue and restrained drama, the film is a symphony of angles and glances, of colors and shadows.\" Amy Taubin from \"Film Comment\" said: \"The narrative, precisely chiseled by Phyllis Nagy from the ungainly novel, is deceptively simple ... What's remarkable about \"Carol\" is that it seems to exist entirely in the present moment—to be precise, in that electric, elastic, heart-stopping/heart-racing present of romantic desire. It is a film composed of gestures and glances, its delicacy a veiled promise of abandon. And it could not exist without the extraordinary performances of Blanchett and Mara.\" David Stratton of \"The Australian\" wrote: \"The meeting of these two women is an electrifying scene; their eyes make contact, and nothing of significance is said, apart from the usual interaction between shopper and shop assistant, but Haynes and his wonderful actors make it very clear that something momentous has occurred — love at first sight.\"\n\nGeoffrey Macnab of \"The Independent\" said: \"Todd Haynes's latest feature is a subtle, moving and deceptive story of two women (brilliantly played in very contrasting styles by Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara) who refuse to live against 'their own grain' ... Phyllis Nagy's screenplay emphasises their steeliness and self-reliance. In sly and subversive fashion, Haynes is laying bare the tensions in a society that refuses to acknowledge 'difference' of any sort.\" Andrew O'Hehir of \"Salon\" wrote: \"From its opening shots of the autumnal, rain-swept streets of New York sometime in the middle of the last century, director Todd Haynes' magnificent new film \"Carol\" establishes a mood of mournful romance, half nostalgic and half ominous, that never lets go.\" Peter Howell of the \"Toronto Star\" said: \"Everything clicks into place for this gorgeous achievement. Cinematographer Ed Lachman shot on Super 16 mm film to achieve era-specific muted colours and softer textures. Precise production design and a palette steeped in shades of green and red (appropriate to the Yuletide setting) make watching it seem like stepping inside an Edward Hopper painting.\" Mark Kermode wrote in \"The Guardian\": \"This superb adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's 1952 novel \"The Price of Salt\" doesn't put a foot wrong. From Phyllis Nagy's alluringly uncluttered script to Cate Blanchett's sturdily tremulous performance as a society woman with everything to lose, this brilliantly captures the thrills, tears and fears of forbidden love.\"\n\nWriting for \"Variety\", Justin Chang said: \"despite their obvious differences in class and background, Therese and Carol seem to ease themselves (and the audience) so quickly and naturally into a bond that they have no interest in defining, or even really discussing — a choice that works not only for an era when their love dared not speak its name, but also for Haynes' faith in the power of the medium to achieve an eloquence beyond words.\" Francine Prose in \"The New York Review of Books\" commented on \"the delicacy, the patience, and the sheer amount of screen time that it lavishes on the experience of falling in love: the hesitations and doubts, the seemingly casual exchanges freighted with meaning and suppressed emotion, the simple happiness of being together.\" Anita Katz from \"The San Francisco Examiner\" said: \"Haynes triumphs in his quest to make a sweeping romantic melodrama with social substance at the core. As a period piece, the movie immerses us in 1950s styles and attitudes. As a sensory experience, it dazzles with everything from rain-streaked windows to Therese's plaid tam-o-shanter ... Haynes powerfully addresses the consequences of ignorance and intolerance. Impressively textured, the drama is filled with secret glances and other subtle aspects of forbidden love.\" Ann Hornaday of \"The Washington Post\" wrote: \"Carol\" is a performance of a performance, whereby codes and signals convey the most essential stuff of life, while the kabuki of being \"normal\" plays out with the carefully cultivated — and patently false — perfection of the toy train village Carol buys from Therese at their first meeting. Working from a carefully crafted script by Phyllis Nagy, Haynes portrays two people thirstily drinking each other in, while on the outside, they sip tea and cocktails with prim decorum.\" Naming it \"one of the year's very best films\", Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" said: \"Camera virtuoso Edward Lachman finds visual poetry in the hothouse eroticism that envelops Carol and Therese, an amateur photographer who keeps framing Carol in her lens. Blanchett, a dream walking in Sandy Powell's frocks, delivers a master class in acting. And Mara is flawless ... [it's] a romantic spellbinder that cuts deep.\" Stephen Whitty in the \"New York Daily News\" praised \"Carol\" as a \"lesbian romance where nobody says the word 'lesbian'... because this isn't just a lesbian story. It's a human one.\"\n\n, \"Carol\" had grossed $12.7 million in the U.S. and Canada, and , $30.2 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $43 million against a budget of $11.8 million. In the United Kingdom, the film earned £540,632 ($812,000) in its opening weekend from 206 screens, ranking Number seven of the top ten films for the weekend. \"Carol\" had grossed $4.0 million in the UK .\n\nIn the United States, the film began its limited run on November 20 at four theaters − The Paris and Angelika Theater in New York and the ArcLight Hollywood and Landmark Theater in Los Angeles − and was projected to earn around $50,000 per theater. It grossed $253,510 in its opening weekend at the four locations, the best opening of Haynes's films. Its per-theater average of $63,378 was the third largest of 2015. In its second weekend, the film grossed $203,076, with a \"robust\" average of $50,769 per location, the best of the week, bringing its nine-day cumulative to $588,355. In its third weekend at the four locations, \"Carol\" earned $147,241, averaging $36,810, the highest for the third week in a row.\n\nThe film expanded from four to sixteen theaters in its fourth week, and was projected to average an estimated $10,000 over the weekend. In its fourth weekend, it grossed $338,000, averaging $21,105 per screen, and bringing its U.S. cumulative total to $1.2 million. The film was projected to earn an estimated $218,000 from 16 theaters in its fifth weekend. It grossed $231,137, averaging $14,446 per theater. \"Carol\" then expanded to 180 theaters. In it sixth weekend, the film made $1.1 million, with a $6,075 average across 180 locations; its U.S. gross was $2.9 million, with $7.8 million worldwide from seven other countries. \"Carol\" reached $5 million in the United States in its seventh weekend.\n\n\"Carol\" has received over 270 industry and critic nominations, and over 85 awards and honours. The film was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Queer Palm and Mara tied for the Best Actress award. It won the Audience Award at the Whistler Film Festival, and the Chicago International Film Festival's Gold Q Hugo Award for exhibiting \"new artistic perspectives on sexuality and identity\". \"Carol\" was the \"overall favorite\" on \"IndieWire\" critics' poll of the best films and performances from the New York Film Festival, topping the Best Narrative Feature, Best Director, Best Lead Performance (Blanchett and Mara), Best Screenplay, and Best Cinematography categories. Lachman was awarded the grand prize for Best Cinematography by the Camerimage International Film Festival. The jury stated:\n\nIn September 2015, The Weinstein Company confirmed that it would campaign for Cate Blanchett as Lead Actress and Rooney Mara as Supporting Actress for the 88th Academy Awards. The film received six Oscar nominations, including Best Actress, and garnered five Golden Globe Award nominations, including Best Motion Picture – Drama. It received nine BAFTA Award nominations, including Best Film. The film was nominated for six Independent Spirit Awards and won for Best Cinematography. It also received nine Critics' Choice Movie Award nominations, including Best Film. Blanchett and Mara received Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role and Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role, respectively.\n\nThe New York Film Critics Circle awarded \"Carol\" Best Film, Best Director, Best Cinematography, and Best Screenplay. The film won Best Music from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and was runner-up for Best Director, Best Cinematography, and Best Production Design. The National Society of Film Critics awarded Haynes Best Director and Lachman Best Cinematography. Haynes and Lachman also received the Boston Society of Film Critics Award for Best Director and Best Cinematography. Lachman won the London Film Critics' Circle Technical Achievement Award. \"Carol\" won five Dorian Awards, including Film of the Year, Director of the Year, Performance of the Year – Actress (Blanchett), LGBTQ Film of the Year and Screenplay of the Year. It was awarded the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film – Wide Release. The Frankfurt Book Fair named \"Carol\" the Best International Literary Adaptation. The American Film Institute selected \"Carol\" as one of its ten Movies of the Year. The AFI Awards jury rationale read:\n\nIn March 2016, the British Film Institute named \"Carol\" the best LGBT film of all time, according to over one hundred film experts in a poll encompassing over eighty years of cinema. In a 2016 BBC poll of 177 critics from 36 countries, \"Carol\" was voted the 69th best film of the 21st century.\n\nThe admiration of \"Carol\" resulted in a fandom community that has been referred to as the \"Cult of Carol\". In June 2017, the tribute comedy short film \"Carol Support Group\" premiered at the San Francisco International LGBTQ Film Festival. Directed by Allison Tate, the film tells the story of mayhem in \"a support group for people addicted to the movie \"Carol\".\" The tagline of the film's poster, \"Some people are addicts forever\", is a parody of the \"Some people change your life forever\" tagline of the original \"Carol\" film poster by StudioCanal.\n\nThe omission of \"Carol\" from Best Picture and Best Director categories prompted speculation from journalists about the perceived indifference of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences toward female- and LGBT-centred films. Nate Scott of \"USA Today\" called it \"the standout snub\" of the ceremony, \"one made all the more ridiculous because of the bloated Best Picture field\". Nico Lang of \"The A.V. Club\" said that despite the film having been considered a \"lock\" for a Best Picture nomination, the omission \"shouldn't have been a major shock\" given the controversy over \"Brokeback Mountain\" loss a decade earlier. Jason Bailey of \"Flavorwire\" said that most Best Picture nominees that include gay themes \"put them firmly in the realm of subplots\". \"\"Carol\" most transgressive quality\", he declared, \"is its refusal to engage in such shenanigans; this is a film about full-blooded gay lives, not tragic gay deaths.\"\n\nAt \"HitFix\", Louis Virtel suggested that Academy members' reception of the film was hurt by its focus on self-determined women. Matthew Jacobs of \"The Huffington Post\" expressed similar sentiments and felt that the Academy's artistic tastes were \"too conventional to recognize its brilliance\". Richard Lawson of \"Vanity Fair\" said that although its \"themes of passion and heartache may be universal\" the film may be \"too gay\", speaking \"in a vernacular that, I'd guess, only queer people are fully fluent in.\" He added that the lack of \"gushing melodrama\" put the film at a disadvantage. Dorothy Snarker of \"IndieWire\" attributed the omissions to the Academy's demographics. Snarker agreed that \"Carol\" may be too gay and too female \"for the largely old white male voting base\" to connect with. She also considered that the successes of the LGBT rights movement in the U.S. may have partly been responsible for the lack of \"political urgency\" around the film.\n\nAt \"The Advocate\", Rebekah Allen argued that \"there are those who simply do not want to see a lesbian love story on screen.\" Trish Bendix of \"AfterEllen\" said that the Best Picture snub was a \"reminder of the patriarchal society we continue to live in, where films that create a space for women to live happily without men and without punishment will not be rewarded.\" Marcie Bianco of \"Quartz\" described the film as \"centered around women's desire\" and structured in a way that \"elevates the power of women's gaze\". The omission from Best Picture, she concluded, illustrates \"yet again how sexism operates in the world, and in the Academy specifically, as the refusal to see women as protagonists and agents of desire.\" In \"Paper\" magazine, Carey O'Donnell observed that gay romances are only \"Oscar surefires\" when they use the tragedy-desolation-demise \"equation\", and that \"a depiction of two strong women in love with each other ... seems to still be troubling to many\". David Ehrlich of \"Rolling Stone\" wrote that the film's \"patience and precision\" did not conform to Academy tastes, but its legacy \"will doubtlessly survive this year's most egregious snub\". Todd Haynes said that he thought having two female leads was \"a factor\" in the omission.\n\nDespite winning Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival (shared with Emmanuelle Bercot) and receiving a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama alongside Blanchett, Mara was nominated for the Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress. The Weinstein Company decided on the category placement to avoid the co-leads competing in the same category. In an interview with \"The New York Times\", Mara seemed displeased by the decision.\n\nIn January 2016, ABC rejected a prime time commercial featuring a snippet of the nude scene between Carol and Therese, which caused The Weinstein Company to re-edit the television trailer.\nIn August 2016, Delta Air Lines was criticised on social media for airing an in-flight entertainment version of \"Carol\" in which the love scenes had been deleted. Phyllis Nagy replied on Twitter that, in contrast to Delta, American and United Airlines had provided the full theatrical release.\n\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1945 by Céline Vipiana. Since November 2015, the headquarters are located at 16 rue Vivienne in the 2nd arrondissement of Paris at the Hôtel Colbert de Torcy, which has French Historic Monument classification. Séverine Merle is the Chief Executive Officer since April 2017.\n\nOn January 21, 2018, LVMH announced that Hedi Slimane will take over at Celine as its artistic, creative and image director.\n\nIn 1945, Céline Vipiana (1915–1997) and her husband, Richard, created one of the first luxury brands in the industry, Céline, a made-to-measure children's shoe business, and opened a first boutique at 52 rue Malte in Paris. The brand was recognised by its logo, the red elephant created by Raymont Peynet.\n\nIn 1960, the brand decided to change its positioning by focusing its business on a ready-to-wear fashion brand for women with a sportswear approach. Henceforth, the brand offered a range of leather goods such as bags, loafers, gloves and clothes. Céline Vipiana remained the designer from 1945-1997.\n\nIn 1964, the launch of the new fragrance \"Vent fou\" and the new ‘American Sulky’ collection of accessories gained success. The trench became the chief product of the house. Prompted by the popularity of leather, Céline opened a leather goods factory in Florence.\n\nIn 1973, Céline redesigned its logo with the intertwined \"C\" Sulky canvas, linked to the Arc-de-Triomphe, which appeared as a symbol for Parisians. At that time, Céline began its expansion in the world with the opening of various boutiques in Monte Carlo, Geneva, Hong Kong, Lausanne, Toronto and Beverly Hills.\n\nThe brand’s founders wished to be part of a charitable association, so Richard Vipiana established the Céline-Pasteur Prize, a sponsor for the American Hospital of Paris in 1973.\n\nIn 1987, Bernard Arnault decided to buy into Céline’s capital. However, it was only in 1996 that the brand was integrated into the LVMH group for 2.7 billion French francs ($540 million). LVMH propelled the brand to fame with the opening of a boutique at 36 avenue Montaigne in Paris.\n\nAmerican fashion designer Michael Kors was named the first ever women's ready-to-wear designer and creative director for Céline in 1997. During his tenure at Céline, Kors brought modern femininity with a luxurious spirit. In 2004, he left the fashion luxury house to focus his career on his own brand.\n\nIn 2005, Italian designer Roberto Menichetti was named creative director.\n\nA year later, Croatian designer Ivana Omazic directed the design studio. Omazic was a former consultant for the brand and previously worked with Romeo Gigli, Prada, Jil Sander and Miu Miu. Omazic designed for Céline until 2008, after further disappointments for the brand.\n\nOn September 4, 2008, the fashion portal \"Women's Wear Daily\" announced that Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, had appointed Phoebe Philo as the new creative director of Céline. Philo's tenure at Céline began in October 2008, and she presented her first ready-to-wear collection for Spring/Summer 2010 at Paris Fashion Week. Pierre-Yves Roussel, chief executive officer of LVMH’s fashion division, said that recruiting Philo was giving her the opportunity to express her vision.\nIn 2009, Vogue Magazine defined her style as the “cool minimal trend”.\n\nPhilo studied at Central Saint Martins School of Art and Design in London. Prior to Céline, Philo held the position of Design Director at Chloé.\n\nIn 2010, Philo received the Designer of the Year award from British Fashion Council. In 2011, she was awarded International Designer of the Year by the Council of Fashion Designers of America. Both prizes were awarded for her work at Céline.\n\nIn December 2017, Philo announced her departure from Céline after finishing the Fall 2018 collection, which is to presented in March of that same year.\n\nOn January 21, 2018, LVMH announced the appointment of Hedi Slimane as \"Artistic, Creative and Image Director\", set to join the house on February 1. He is to direct all Céline collections, extending the brand's offering with the launch of men’s fashion, couture and fragrances. In September 2018, Slimane presented an updated Celine logo on the brand's Instagram account.\n\nDakota Johnson was the first celebrity to wear Slimane’s first Celine collection on the red carpet for the Los Angeles premiere of Suspiria.\n\nThe brand owns almost 150 stores worldwide and is distributed through a selective network including department stores such as Barneys New York (New York), Bergdorf Goodman (New York), Harrods (London) and Galeries Lafayette (Paris).\n\n"}

Chemesthetic sensations arise when chemical compounds activate receptors associated with other senses that mediate pain, touch, and thermal perception. These chemical-induced reactions do not fit into the traditional sense categories of taste and smell. Examples of chemesthetic sensations include the burn-like irritation from capsaicin and related compounds in foods like chili peppers; the coolness of menthol in mouthwashes and topical analgesic creams; the stinging or tingling of carbonated beverages in the nose and mouth; the tear-induction of cut onions; and the pungent, cough-inducing sensation in the back of the throat elicited by the oleocanthal in high-quality extra virgin olive oil. Some of these sensations may be referred to as spiciness, pungency, or piquancy.\n\nChemesthetic sensations sometimes arise by direct chemical activation of ion channels on sensory nerve fibers, for example of transient receptor potential channels including those of the TRPV, TRPA or TRPM subtypes. Alternatively, irritant chemicals may activate cells of the epithelium to release substances that indirectly activate the nerve fibers. The respiratory passages, including the nose and trachea, possess specialized cells called solitary chemosensory cells which release acetylcholine or other activators to excite nearby nerve fibers.\n\nBecause chemoresponsive nerve fibers are present in all types of skin, chemesthetic sensations can be aroused from anywhere on the body's surface as well as from mucosal surfaces in the nose, mouth, eyes, etc. Mucus membranes are generally more sensitive to chemesthetic stimuli because they lack the barrier function of cornified skin.\n\nMuch of the chemesthetic flavor sensations are mediated by the trigeminal nerves, which are relatively large and important nerves. Flavors that stimulate the trigeminal nerves are therefore important - for example, carbon dioxide is the trigeminal stimulant in carbonated beverages.\n"}

Over the years, however, the terminology has changed; it is now applied broadly as an often pejorative term to describe paintings and designs that are overly idealistic and sentimental.\n\nUsing his own paintings of children, flowers and holiday scenes Richard Cadbury, the son of the founder of Cadbury's, introduced such designs to his chocolate boxes in the late 19th century.\n\nRenoir's paintings have been described as \"chocolate box\" and have been derided by Degas and Picasso for being happy, inoffensive scenes.

{"id": "33981742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33981742", "title": "Confusion in Canadian trademark law", "text": "Confusion in Canadian trademark law\n\nUnder Canadian trade-mark law, \"confusion\" is where a trade-mark is similar enough to another trade-mark to cause consumers to equate them. Likelihood of confusion plays a central role in trade-mark registration, infringement and passing-off. Whether a trade-mark or trade-name is confusing is a question of fact. The role of confusion in trade-mark law is analogous to the role of substantial infringement in patent law.\n\nSection 6 of the \"Trademarks Act\" sets out the situations where a trade-mark is confusing:\n\nThe essence of confusion is the inference of common source. In other words, Trade-mark A will be confusing with Trade-mark B if the use of both trade-marks in the same area will lead consumers to believe that the goods or services sold under either trade-mark originate from the same source.\n\nSection 6(5) of the \"Trademarks Act\" provides that in determining whether there is confusion, a court must examine \"all of the surrounding circumstances\" including:\n\nThe factors under section 6(5) are not exhaustive. Also, given the factual nature of confusion, the particular factors considered and the weighing of the factors varies from case-to-case.\n\nDetermining the degree of resemblance between the trade-marks is the starting point of a confusion analysis. The assessment of resemblance under s. 6(5)(e) is not limited to similarities in the appearance of the trade-marks. Similar sounding word marks can be confusing, even if they appear to be different. Word marks representing similar ideas can be confusing (e.g. \"Smoothies\" and \"Smarties\" in the context of candies).\n\nIn determining the degree of resemblance between the trade-marks, a court will examine each trade-mark as a whole, rather than breaking it up into its individual elements. For example, in \"Molson Companies Ltd. v. John Labatt Ltd.\", the Federal Court of Appeal compared the trade-marks \"Molson Golden\" and \"Winchester Gold\" in their entirety. Although both trade-marks used the descriptive \"Gold\" or \"Golden\", when viewed as a whole, the trade-marks were sufficiently distinguishable that there was no reasonable likelihood of confusion.\n\nIn a leading case on confusion, \"Mattel, Inc. v. 3894207 Canada Inc.\", the Supreme Court of Canada stated that the appropriate standard of comparison is that of the \"ordinary casual consumer somewhat in a hurry\". In applying this standard, a court will ask whether a consumer of average intelligence and caution casually encountering both trade-marks in the marketplace would be likely to confuse them.\n\nIn addition to predicting whether an \"ordinary casual consumer somewhat in a hurry\" would perceive confusion, a court may also consider evidence of actual confusion of the trade-marks in the marketplace. Although evidence of actual confusion is not necessary, the presence or absence of actual confusion in the marketplace may be a relevant \"surrounding circumstance\" under s. 6(5) of the \"Trade-marks Act\".\n\nMarks consisting of everyday words or expressions are inherently less distinctive than ones based on invented or coined words or expressions. However, a mark based on an everyday word may nonetheless acquire distinctiveness if it is employed extensively. In \"Mattel\", the Court found that although Mattel’s \"Barbie\" trade-mark was based on an every day word, it had acquired substantial distinctiveness through its strong association with the company's doll products.\n\nAlthough section 6(2) of the \"Trade-marks Act\" provides that there can be confusion \"whether or not the wares or service are of the same general class\", differences in the types of goods or services associated with each trade-mark are a relevant consideration in determining confusion. In \"Mattel\", the Supreme Court found it unlikely that consumers would confuse \"Barbie\" for dolls with \"Barbie\" for restaurants. Similarly, in \"Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin v. Boutiques Cliquot Ltée\", the Supreme Court of Canada found that the use of \"Cliquot\" for mid-market women’s clothing stores was not confusing with \"Veuve Clicquot\" as a mark for a famous brand of champagne. While it is possible for a famous trade-mark holder to argue that its trade-mark will expand into new lines of business, there must a reasonable basis for this prediction.\n\n"}
{"id": "42733164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42733164", "title": "Death of the Virgin (Anonymous)", "text": "Death of the Virgin (Anonymous)\n\nThe Death of the Virgin acquired in 1944 by the Legion of Honor Art Museum in San Francisco is an oil painting on a panel created sometime in the late fifteenth century in Swabia, Germany by an unknown artist, portraying the Virgin Mary surrounded by the twelve apostles. The subject has been painted by several other anonymous masters of the Death of the Virgin.\n\nThe painting contains many key religious figures, as religious works were the most popular during the Middle Ages. Religious paintings would often be done as works of patronage to a church, especially during the early Middle Ages. Towards the end of the fifteenth century, however, it was common for works of art to include more aspects of secular life and create a more human connection to the painting. The fact that Mary is elderly as she would be at that point in her life is historically accurate. All apostles are present at the scene of her death, but neither Jesus Christ nor any angels appear in the work. \nThe artwork contains a few symbols in it. One of the symbols is the candle which the Virgin Mary can be seen holding. This is often a sign of the fact that Mary is still alive in the work. In other works the candle may be out, signifying she has passed. Around her bed are the twelve apostles, who appear to be in a kind of funerary ritual, as one can be seen reading from a book, another is sprinkling her with water, and another is holding incense. The bed also has a step, making it so that the viewer does not seem to out of complete reach of the Virgin Mary. Mary is also dying in a house or room, which has more in common with a fifteenth century home than a fifth century one. \nThe Death of the Virgin is inspired by a legend which originated in the fifth century, as it is nowhere to be found in any book from the Bible. The legend is also known as the Dormition of Theotokos (“the one who gave birth to God”), and originated mostly likely in the Byzantine world, working its way westward into Europe. In the legend, Mary is visited by an angel, sometimes Gabriel, informing her that she will die soon. She is granted a wish in which she asks to be united with all twelve apostles when she dies. As such, the apostles are miraculously transported from all over the world to the place where the Virgin Mary is dying. Those who are dead are also transported, some appearing on clouds. The artist of the work has chosen to represent this aspect of the story, as all the apostles appear. However, the author’s choice to be more realistic has led to the fact that no angels are present at the scene.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8886", "title": "Deconstruction", "text": "Deconstruction\n\nDeconstruction is a critique of the relationship between text and meaning originated by the philosopher Jacques Derrida. Derrida's approach consisted in conducting readings of texts with an ear to what runs counter to the intended meaning or structural unity of a particular text. The purpose of deconstruction is to show that the usage of language in a given text, and language as a whole, are irreducibly complex, unstable, or impossible. Throughout his readings, Derrida hoped to show deconstruction at work.\n\nMany debates in continental philosophy surrounding ontology, epistemology, ethics, aesthetics, hermeneutics, and philosophy of language refer to Derrida's observations. Since the 1980s, these observations inspired a range of theoretical enterprises in the humanities, including the disciplines of law anthropology, historiography, linguistics, sociolinguistics, psychoanalysis, LGBT studies, and the feminist school of thought. Deconstruction also inspired deconstructivism in architecture and remains important within art, music, and literary criticism.\n\nWhile common in continental Europe (and wherever Continental philosophy is in the mainstream), deconstruction is not adopted or accepted by most philosophy departments in universities where analytic philosophy is predominant.\n\nJacques Derrida's 1967 book \"Of Grammatology\" introduced the majority of ideas influential within deconstruction. Derrida published a number of other works directly relevant to the concept of deconstruction. Books showing deconstruction in action or defining it more completely include \"Différance\", \"Speech and Phenomena\", and \"Writing and Difference\".\n\nAccording to Derrida and taking inspiration from the work of Ferdinand de Saussure, language as a system of signs and words only has meaning because of the contrast between these signs. As Rorty contends, \"words have meaning only because of contrast-effects with other words...no word can acquire meaning in the way in which philosophers from Aristotle to Bertrand Russell have hoped it might—by being the unmediated expression of something non-linguistic (e.g., an emotion, a sense-datum, a physical object, an idea, a Platonic Form)\". As a consequence, meaning is never present, but rather is deferred to other signs. Derrida refers to the—in this view, mistaken—belief that there is a self-sufficient, non-deferred meaning as metaphysics of presence. A concept, then, must be understood in the context of its opposite, such as being/nothingness, normal/abnormal, speech/writing, etc.\n\nFurther, Derrida contends that \"in a classical philosophical opposition we are not dealing with the peaceful coexistence of a vis-a-vis, but rather with a violent hierarchy. One of the two terms governs the other (axiologically, logically, etc.), or has the upper hand\": signified over signifier; intelligible over sensible; speech over writing; activity over passivity, etc. The first task of deconstruction would be to find and overturn these oppositions inside a text or a corpus of texts; but the final objective of deconstruction is not to surpass all oppositions, because it is assumed they are structurally necessary to produce sense. The oppositions simply cannot be suspended once and for all. The hierarchy of dual oppositions always reestablishes itself. Deconstruction only points to the necessity of an unending analysis that can make explicit the decisions and arbitrary violence intrinsic to all texts.\n\nFinally, Derrida argues that it is not enough to expose and deconstruct the way oppositions work and then stop there in a nihilistic or cynical position, \"thereby preventing any means of intervening in the field effectively\". To be effective, deconstruction needs to create new terms, not to synthesize the concepts in opposition, but to mark their difference and eternal interplay. This explains why Derrida always proposes new terms in his deconstruction, not as a free play but as a pure necessity of analysis, to better mark the intervals. Derrida called undecidables—that is, unities of simulacrum—\"false\" verbal properties (nominal or semantic) that can no longer be included within philosophical (binary) opposition, but which, however, inhabit philosophical oppositions—resisting and organizing it—without ever constituting a third term, without ever leaving room for a solution in the form of Hegelian dialectics (e.g., différance, archi-writing, pharmakon, supplement, hymen, gram, spacing).\n\nDerrida's theories on deconstruction were themselves influenced by the work of linguists such as Ferdinand de Saussure (whose writings on semiotics also became a cornerstone of structuralist theory in the mid-20th century) and literary theorists such as Roland Barthes (whose works were an investigation of the logical ends of structuralist thought). Derrida's views on deconstruction stood in opposition to the theories of structuralists such as psychoanalytic theorist Jacques Lacan, and linguist Claude Lévi-Strauss. However, Derrida resisted attempts to label his work as \"post-structuralist\".\n\nIn order to understand Derrida's motivation, one must refer to Nietzsche's philosophy.\n\nNietzsche's project began with Orpheus, the man underground. This foil to Platonic light was deliberately and self-consciously lauded in \"Daybreak\", when Nietzsche announces, albeit retrospectively, \"In this work you will discover a subterranean man at work\", and then goes on to map the project of unreason: \"All things that live long are gradually so saturated with reason that their origin in unreason thereby becomes improbable. Does not almost every precise history of an origination impress our feelings as paradoxical and wantonly offensive? Does the good historian not, at bottom, constantly contradict?\".\n\nNietzsche's point in \"Daybreak\" is that standing at the end of modern history, modern thinkers know too much to be deceived by the illusion of reason any more. Reason, logic, philosophy and science are no longer solely sufficient as the royal roads to truth. And so Nietzsche decides to throw it in our faces, and uncover the truth of Plato, that he—unlike Orpheus—just happened to discover his true love in the light instead of in the dark. This being merely one historical event amongst many, Nietzsche proposes that we revisualize the history of the West as the history of a series of political moves, that is, a manifestation of the will to power, that at bottom have no greater or lesser claim to truth in any noumenal (absolute) sense. By calling our attention to the fact that he has assumed the role of Orpheus, the man underground, in dialectical opposition to Plato, Nietzsche hopes to sensitize us to the political and cultural context, and the political influences that impact authorship. For example, the political influences that led one author to choose philosophy over poetry (or at least \"portray\" himself as having made such a choice), and another to make a different choice.\n\nThe problem with Nietzsche, as Derrida sees it, is that he did not go far enough. That he missed the fact that this will to power is itself but a manifestation of the operation of writing. And so Derrida wishes to help us step beyond Nietzsche's penultimate revaluation of all western values, to the ultimate, which is the final appreciation of \"the role of writing in the production of knowledge\".\n\nDerrida approaches all texts as constructed around elemental oppositions which all discourse has to articulate if it intends to make any sense whatsoever. This is so because identity is viewed in non-essentialist terms as a construct, and because constructs only produce meaning through the interplay of difference inside a \"system of distinct signs\". This approach to text is influenced by the semiology of Ferdinand de Saussure.\n\nSaussure is considered one of the fathers of structuralism when he explained that terms get their meaning in reciprocal determination with other terms inside language:\n\nIn language there are only differences. Even more important: a difference generally implies positive terms between which the difference is set up; but in language there are only differences without positive terms. Whether we take the signified or the signifier, language has neither ideas nor sounds that existed before the linguistic system, but only conceptual and phonic differences that have issued from the system. The idea or phonic substance that a sign contains is of less importance than the other signs that surround it. [...] A linguistic system is a series of differences of sound combined with a series of differences of ideas; but the pairing of a certain number of acoustical signs with as many cuts made from the mass thought engenders a system of values.\n\nSaussure explicitly suggested that linguistics was only a branch of a more general semiology, a science of signs in general, human codes being only one part. Nevertheless, in the end, as Derrida pointed out, Saussure made linguistics \"the regulatory model\", and \"for essential, and essentially metaphysical, reasons had to privilege speech, and everything that links the sign to phone\". Derrida will prefer to follow the more \"fruitful paths (formalization)\" of a general semiotics without falling into what he considered \"a hierarchizing teleology\" privileging linguistics, and to speak of \"mark\" rather than of language, not as something restricted to mankind, but as prelinguistic, as the pure possibility of language, working everywhere there is a relation to something else.\n\nDerrida's original use of the word \"deconstruction\" was a translation of \"Destruktion\", a concept from the work of Martin Heidegger that Derrida sought to apply to textual reading. Heidegger's term referred to a process of exploring the categories and concepts that tradition has imposed on a word, and the history behind them.\n\nDerrida's concerns flow from a consideration of several issues:\n\n\nTo this end, Derrida follows a long line of modern philosophers, who look backwards to Plato and his influence on the Western metaphysical tradition. Like Nietzsche, Derrida suspects Plato of dissimulation in the service of a political project, namely the education, through critical reflections, of a class of citizens more strategically positioned to influence the polis. However, like Nietzsche, Derrida is not satisfied merely with such a political interpretation of Plato, because of the particular dilemma modern humans find themselves in. His Platonic reflections are inseparably part of his critique of modernity, hence the attempt to be something beyond the modern, because of this Nietzschian sense that the modern has lost its way and become mired in nihilism.\n\nDifférance is the observation that the meanings of words come from their synchrony with other words within the language and their diachrony between contemporary and historical definitions of a word. Understanding language, according to Derrida, requires an understanding of both viewpoints of linguistic analysis. The focus on diachrony has led to accusations against Derrida of engaging in the etymological fallacy.\n\nThere is one statement by Derrida—in an essay on Rousseau in \"Of Grammatology\"—which has been of great interest to his opponents. It is the assertion that \"there is no outside-text\" (\"il n'y a pas de hors-texte\"), which is often mistranslated as \"there is nothing outside of the text\". The mistranslation is often used to suggest Derrida believes that nothing exists but words. Michel Foucault, for instance, famously misattributed to Derrida the very different phrase \"Il n'y a rien en dehors du texte\" for this purpose. According to Derrida, his statement simply refers to the unavoidability of context that is at the heart of différance.\n\nFor example, the word \"house\" derives its meaning more as a function of how it differs from \"shed\", \"mansion\", \"hotel\", \"building\", etc. (Form of Content, that Louis Hjelmslev distinguished from Form of Expression) than how the word \"house\" may be tied to a certain image of a traditional house (i.e., the relationship between signified and signifier), with each term being established in reciprocal determination with the other terms than by an ostensive description or definition: when can we talk about a \"house\" or a \"mansion\" or a \"shed\"? The same can be said about verbs, in all the languages in the world: when should we stop saying \"walk\" and start saying \"run\"? The same happens, of course, with adjectives: when must we stop saying \"yellow\" and start saying \"orange\", or exchange \"past\" for \"present\"? Not only are the topological differences between the words relevant here, but the differentials between what is signified is also covered by différance.\n\nThus, complete meaning is always \"differential\" and \"postponed\" in language; there is never a moment when meaning is complete and total. A simple example would consist of looking up a given word in a dictionary, then proceeding to look up the words found in that word's definition, etc., also comparing with older dictionaries. Such a process would never end.\n\nDerrida describes the task of deconstruction as the identification of metaphysics of presence, or \"logocentrism\" in western philosophy. Metaphysics of presence is the desire for immediate access to meaning, the privileging of presence over absence. This means that there is an assumed bias in certain binary oppositions where one side is placed in a position over another, such as good over bad, speech over the written word, male over female. Derrida writes, \"Without a doubt, Aristotle thinks of time on the basis of ousia as parousia, on the basis of the now, the point, etc. And yet an entire reading could be organized that would repeat in Aristotle's text both this limitation and its opposite\". To Derrida, the central bias of logocentrism was the now being placed as more important than the future or past. This argument is largely based on the earlier work of Heidegger, who, in \"Being and Time\", claimed that the theoretical attitude of pure presence is parasitical upon a more originary involvement with the world in concepts such as ready-to-hand and being-with.\n\nIn the deconstruction procedure, one of the main concerns of Derrida is to not collapse into Hegel's dialectic, where these oppositions would be reduced to contradictions in a dialectic that has the purpose of resolving it into a synthesis. The presence of Hegelian dialectics was enormous in the intellectual life of France during the second half of the 20th century, with the influence of Kojève and Hyppolite, but also with the impact of dialectics based on contradiction developed by Marxists, and including the existentialism of Sartre, etc. This explains Derrida's concern to always distinguish his procedure from Hegel's, since Hegelianism believes binary oppositions would produce a synthesis, while Derrida saw binary oppositions as incapable of collapsing into a synthesis free from the original contradiction.\n\nThere have been problems defining deconstruction. Derrida claimed that all of his essays were attempts to define what deconstruction is, and that deconstruction is necessarily complicated and difficult to explain since it actively criticises the very language needed to explain it.\n\nDerrida has been more forthcoming with negative (apophatic) than with positive descriptions of deconstruction. When asked by Toshihiko Izutsu some preliminary considerations on how to translate \"deconstruction\" in Japanese, in order to at least prevent using a Japanese term contrary to deconstruction's actual meaning, Derrida began his response by saying that such a question amounts to \"what deconstruction is not, or rather \"ought\" not to be\".\n\nDerrida states that deconstruction is not an analysis, a critique, or a method in the traditional sense that philosophy understands these terms. In these negative descriptions of deconstruction, Derrida is seeking to \"multiply the cautionary indicators and put aside all the traditional philosophical concepts\". This does not mean that deconstruction has absolutely nothing in common with an analysis, a critique, or a method, because while Derrida distances deconstruction from these terms, he reaffirms \"the necessity of returning to them, at least under erasure\". Derrida's necessity of returning to a term under erasure means that even though these terms are problematic we must use them until they can be effectively reformulated or replaced. The relevance of the tradition of negative theology to Derrida's preference for negative descriptions of deconstruction is the notion that a positive description of deconstruction would over-determine the idea of deconstruction and would close off the openness that Derrida wishes to preserve for deconstruction. If Derrida were to positively define deconstruction—as, for example, a critique—then this would make the concept of critique immune to itself being deconstructed. Some new philosophy beyond deconstruction would then be required in order to encompass the notion of critique.\n\nDerrida states that \"Deconstruction is not a method, and cannot be transformed into one\". This is because deconstruction is not a mechanical operation. Derrida warns against considering deconstruction as a mechanical operation, when he states that \"It is true that in certain circles (university or cultural, especially in the United States) the technical and methodological \"metaphor\" that seems necessarily attached to the very word 'deconstruction' has been able to seduce or lead astray\". Commentator Richard Beardsworth explains that\n\nDerrida is careful to avoid this term [method] because it carries connotations of a procedural form of judgement. A thinker with a method has already decided \"how\" to proceed, is unable to give him or herself up to the matter of thought in hand, is a functionary of the criteria which structure his or her conceptual gestures. For Derrida [...] this is irresponsibility itself. Thus, to talk of a method in relation to deconstruction, especially regarding its ethico-political implications, would appear to go directly against the current of Derrida's philosophical adventure.\n\nBeardsworth here explains that it would be irresponsible to undertake a deconstruction with a complete set of rules that need only be applied as a method to the object of deconstruction, because this understanding would reduce deconstruction to a thesis of the reader that the text is then made to fit. This would be an irresponsible act of reading, because it becomes a prejudicial procedure that only finds what it sets out to find.\n\nDerrida states that deconstruction is not a critique in the Kantian sense. This is because Kant defines the term critique as the opposite of dogmatism. For Derrida, it is not possible to escape the dogmatic baggage of the language we use in order to perform a pure critique in the Kantian sense. Language is dogmatic because it is inescapably metaphysical. Derrida argues that language is inescapably metaphysical because it is made up of signifiers that only refer to that which transcends them—the signified. In addition, Derrida asks rhetorically \"Is not the idea of knowledge and of the acquisition of knowledge in itself metaphysical?\" By this, Derrida means that all claims to know something necessarily involve an assertion of the metaphysical type that something \"is\" the case somewhere. For Derrida the concept of neutrality is suspect and dogmatism is therefore involved in everything to a certain degree. Deconstruction can challenge a particular dogmatism and hence desediment dogmatism in general, but it cannot escape all dogmatism all at once.\n\nDerrida states that deconstruction is not an analysis in the traditional sense. This is because the possibility of analysis is predicated on the possibility of breaking up the text being analysed into elemental component parts. Derrida argues that there are no self-sufficient units of meaning in a text, because individual words or sentences in a text can only be properly understood in terms of how they fit into the larger structure of the text and language itself. For more on Derrida's theory of meaning see the article on différance.\n\nDerrida states that his use of the word deconstruction first took place in a context in which \"structuralism was dominant\" and deconstruction's meaning is within this context. Derrida states that deconstruction is an \"antistructuralist gesture\" because \"[s]tructures were to be undone, decomposed, desedimented\". At the same time, deconstruction is also a \"structuralist gesture\" because it is concerned with the structure of texts. So, deconstruction involves \"a certain attention to structures\" and tries to \"understand how an 'ensemble' was constituted\". As both a structuralist and an antistructuralist gesture, deconstruction is tied up with what Derrida calls the \"structural problematic\". The structural problematic for Derrida is the tension between genesis, that which is \"in the essential mode of creation or movement\", and structure: \"systems, or complexes, or static configurations\". An example of genesis would be the sensory ideas from which knowledge is then derived in the empirical epistemology. An example of structure would be a binary opposition such as good and evil where the meaning of each element is established, at least partly, through its relationship to the other element.\n\nIt is for this reason that Derrida distances his use of the term deconstruction from post-structuralism, a term that would suggest that philosophy could simply go beyond structuralism. Derrida states that \"the motif of deconstruction has been associated with 'post-structuralism, but that this term was \"a word unknown in France until its 'return' from the United States\". In his deconstruction of Husserl, Derrida actually argues the contamination of pure origins by the structures of language and temporality. Manfred Frank has even referred to Derrida's work as \"Neostructuralism\".\n\nThe popularity of the term deconstruction, combined with the technical difficulty of Derrida's primary material on deconstruction and his reluctance to elaborate his understanding of the term, has meant that many secondary sources have attempted to give a more straightforward explanation than Derrida himself ever attempted. Secondary definitions are therefore an interpretation of deconstruction by the person offering them rather than a summary of Derrida's actual position.\n\n\nA survey of the secondary literature reveals a wide range of heterogeneous arguments. Particularly problematic are the attempts to give neat introductions to deconstruction by people trained in literary criticism who sometimes have little or no expertise in the relevant areas of philosophy that Derrida is working in. These secondary works (e.g. \"Deconstruction for Beginners\" and \"Deconstructions: A User's Guide\") have attempted to explain deconstruction while being academically criticized as too far removed from the original texts and Derrida's actual position.\n\nDerrida's observations have greatly influenced literary criticism and post-structuralism.\n\nDerrida's method consisted of demonstrating all the forms and varieties of the originary complexity of semiotics, and their multiple consequences in many fields. His way of achieving this was by conducting thorough, careful, sensitive, and yet transformational readings of philosophical and literary texts, with an ear to what in those texts runs counter to their apparent systematicity (structural unity) or intended sense (authorial genesis). By demonstrating the aporias and ellipses of thought, Derrida hoped to show the infinitely subtle ways that this originary complexity, which by definition cannot ever be completely known, works its structuring and destructuring effects.\n\nDeconstruction denotes the pursuing of the meaning of a text to the point of exposing the supposed contradictions and internal oppositions upon which it is founded—supposedly showing that those foundations are irreducibly complex, unstable, or impossible. It is an approach that may be deployed in philosophy, in literary analysis, and even in the analysis of scientific writings. Deconstruction generally tries to demonstrate that any text is not a discrete whole but contains several irreconcilable and contradictory meanings; that any text therefore has more than one interpretation; that the text itself links these interpretations inextricably; that the incompatibility of these interpretations is irreducible; and thus that an interpretative reading cannot go beyond a certain point. Derrida refers to this point as an \"aporia\" in the text; thus, deconstructive reading is termed \"aporetic.\" He insists that meaning is made possible by the relations of a word to other words within the network of structures that language is.\n\nDerrida initially resisted granting to his approach the overarching name \"deconstruction\", on the grounds that it was a precise technical term that could not be used to characterize his work generally. Nevertheless, he eventually accepted that the term had come into common use to refer to his textual approach, and Derrida himself increasingly began to use the term in this more general way.\n\nDerrida's deconstruction strategy is also used by postmodernists to locate meaning in a text rather than discover meaning due to the position that it has multiple readings. There is a focus on the deconstruction that denotes the tearing apart of a text to find arbitrary hierarchies and presuppositions for the purpose of tracing contradictions that shadow a text's coherence. Here, the meaning of a text does not reside with the author or the author's intentions because it is dependent on the interaction between reader and text. Even the process of translation is also seen as transformative since it \"modifies the original even as it modifies the translating language.\"\n\nDerrida's lecture at Johns Hopkins University, \"Structure, Sign, and Play in the Human Sciences\", often appears in collections as a manifesto against structuralism. Derrida's essay was one of the earliest to propose some theoretical limitations to structuralism, and to attempt to theorize on terms that were clearly no longer structuralist. Structuralism viewed language as a number of signs, composed of a signified (the meaning) and a signifier (the word itself). Derrida proposed that signs always referred to other signs, existing only in relation to each other, and there was therefore no ultimate foundation or centre. This is the basis of différance.\n\nBetween the late 1960s and the early 1980s, many thinkers were influenced by deconstruction, including Paul de Man, Geoffrey Hartman, and J. Hillis Miller. This group came to be known as the Yale school and was especially influential in literary criticism. Derrida and Hillis Miller were subsequently affiliated with the University of California, Irvine.\n\nMiller has described deconstruction this way: \"Deconstruction is not a dismantling of the structure of a text, but a demonstration that it has already dismantled itself. Its apparently solid ground is no rock, but thin air.\"\n\nArguing that law and politics cannot be separated, the founders of the \"Critical Legal Studies Movement\" found it necessary to criticize the absence of the recognition of this inseparability at the level of theory. To demonstrate the indeterminacy of legal doctrine, these scholars often adopt a method, such as structuralism in linguistics, or deconstruction in Continental philosophy, to make explicit the deep structure of categories and tensions at work in legal texts and talk. The aim was to deconstruct the tensions and procedures by which they are constructed, expressed, and deployed.\n\nFor example, Duncan Kennedy, in explicit reference to semiotics and deconstruction procedures, maintains that various legal doctrines are constructed around the binary pairs of opposed concepts, each of which has a claim upon intuitive and formal forms of reasoning that must be made explicit in their meaning and relative value, and criticized. Self and other, private and public, subjective and objective, freedom and control are examples of such pairs demonstrating the influence of opposing concepts on the development of legal doctrines throughout history.\n\nDeconstructive readings of history and sources have changed the entire discipline of history. In \"Deconstructing History\", Alun Munslow examines history in what he argues is a postmodern age. He provides an introduction to the debates and issues of postmodernist history. He also surveys the latest research into the relationship between the past, history, and historical practice, as well as articulating his own theoretical challenges.\n\nJean-Luc Nancy argues, in his 1982 book \"The Inoperative Community\", for an understanding of community and society that is undeconstructable because it is prior to conceptualisation. Nancy's work is an important development of deconstruction because it takes the challenge of deconstruction seriously and attempts to develop an understanding of political terms that is undeconstructable and therefore suitable for a philosophy after Derrida.\n\nSimon Critchley, an English philosopher, argues, in his 1992 book \"The Ethics of Deconstruction\", that Derrida's deconstruction is an intrinsically ethical practice. Critchley argues that deconstruction involves an openness to the Other that makes it ethical in the Levinasian understanding of the term.\n\nJacques Derrida has had a great influence on contemporary political theory and political philosophy. Derrida's thinking has inspired Slavoj Zizek, Richard Rorty, Ernesto Laclau, Judith Butler and many more contemporary theorists who have developed a deconstructive approach to politics. Because deconstruction examines the internal logic of any given text or discourse it has helped many authors to analyse the contradictions inherent in all schools of thought; and, as such, it has proved revolutionary in political analysis, particularly ideology critiques.\n\nRichard Beardsworth, developing from Critchley's \"Ethics of Deconstruction\", argues, in his 1996 \"Derrida and the Political\", that deconstruction is an intrinsically political practice. He further argues that the future of deconstruction faces a perhaps undecidable choice between a theological approach and a technological approach, represented first of all by the work of Bernard Stiegler.\n\nDerrida was involved in a number of high-profile disagreements with prominent philosophers, including Michel Foucault, John Searle, Willard Van Orman Quine, Peter Kreeft, and Jürgen Habermas. Most of the criticism of deconstruction were first articulated by these philosophers and repeated elsewhere.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Searle had a brief exchange with Jacques Derrida regarding speech-act theory. The exchange was characterized by a degree of mutual hostility between the philosophers, each of whom accused the other of having misunderstood his basic points. Searle was particularly hostile to Derrida's deconstructionist framework and much later refused to let his response to Derrida be printed along with Derrida's papers in the 1988 collection \"Limited Inc\". Searle did not consider Derrida's approach to be legitimate philosophy, or even intelligible writing, and argued that he did not want to legitimize the deconstructionist point of view by paying any attention to it. Consequently, some critics have considered the exchange to be a series of elaborate misunderstandings rather than a debate, while others have seen either Derrida or Searle gaining the upper hand. The level of hostility can be seen from Searle's statement that \"It would be a mistake to regard Derrida's discussion of Austin as a confrontation between two prominent philosophical traditions\", to which Derrida replied that that sentence was \"the only sentence of the 'reply' to which I can subscribe\". Commentators have frequently interpreted the exchange as a prominent example of a confrontation between analytic and Continental philosophies.\n\nThe debate began in 1972, when, in his paper \"Signature Event Context\", Derrida analyzed J. L. Austin's theory of the illocutionary act. While sympathetic to Austin's departure from a purely denotational account of language to one that includes \"force\", Derrida was sceptical of the framework of normativity employed by Austin. Derrida argued that Austin had missed the fact that any speech event is framed by a \"structure of absence\" (the words that are left unsaid due to contextual constraints) and by \"iterability\" (the constraints on what can be said, imposed by what has been said in the past). Derrida argued that the focus on intentionality in speech-act theory was misguided because intentionality is restricted to that which is already established as a possible intention. He also took issue with the way Austin had excluded the study of fiction, non-serious, or \"parasitic\" speech, wondering whether this exclusion was because Austin had considered these speech genres as governed by different structures of meaning, or hadn't considered them due to a lack of interest. In his brief reply to Derrida, \"Reiterating the Differences: A Reply to Derrida\", Searle argued that Derrida's critique was unwarranted because it assumed that Austin's theory attempted to give a full account of language and meaning when its aim was much narrower. Searle considered the omission of parasitic discourse forms to be justified by the narrow scope of Austin's inquiry. Searle agreed with Derrida's proposal that intentionality presupposes iterability, but did not apply the same concept of intentionality used by Derrida, being unable or unwilling to engage with the continental conceptual apparatus. This, in turn, caused Derrida to criticize Searle for not being sufficiently familiar with phenomenological perspectives on intentionality. Searle also argued that Derrida's disagreement with Austin turned on Derrida's having misunderstood Austin's type–token distinction and having failed to understand Austin's concept of failure in relation to performativity. Some critics have suggested that Searle, by being so grounded in the analytical tradition that he was unable to engage with Derrida's continental phenomenological tradition, was at fault for the unsuccessful nature of the exchange.\n\nDerrida, in his response to Searle ( in \"Limited Inc\"), ridiculed Searle's positions. Claiming that a clear sender of Searle's message could not be established, Derrida suggested that Searle had formed with Austin a \"société à responsabilité limitée\" (a \"limited liability company\") due to the ways in which the ambiguities of authorship within Searle's reply circumvented the very speech act of his reply. Searle did not reply. Later in 1988, Derrida tried to review his position and his critiques of Austin and Searle, reiterating that he found the constant appeal to \"normality\" in the analytical tradition to be problematic.\n\nIn the debate, Derrida praised Austin's work, but argued that Austin is wrong to banish what Austin calls \"infelicities\" from the \"normal\" operation of language. One \"infelicity\", for instance, occurs when it cannot be known whether a given speech act is \"sincere\" or \"merely citational\" (and therefore possibly ironic). Derrida argues that every iteration is necessarily \"citational\", due to the graphematic nature of speech and writing, and that language could not work at all without the ever-present and ineradicable possibility of such alternate readings. Derrida takes Searle to task for attempting to get around this issue by grounding final authority in the speaker's inaccessible \"intention\". Derrida argues that intention cannot possibly govern how an iteration signifies, once it becomes hearable or readable. All speech acts borrow from a language whose significance is determined by historical-linguistic context, and by the alternate possibilities that this context makes possible. This significance, Derrida argues, cannot be altered or governed by the whims of intention.\n\nDerrida argued against the constant appeal to \"normality\" in the analytical tradition of which Austin and Searle were paradigmatic examples.\n\nDerrida argued that it was problematic to establish the relation between \"nonfiction or standard discourse\" and \"fiction,\" defined as its \"parasite, \"for part of the most originary essence of the latter is to allow fiction, the simulacrum, parasitism, to take place—and in so doing to \"de-essentialize\" itself as it were\".\nHe would finally argue that the indispensable question would then become:\nIn 1995, Searle gave a brief reply to Derrida in \"The Construction of Social Reality\". He called Derrida's conclusion \"preposterous\" and stated that \"Derrida, as far as I can tell, does not have an argument. He simply declares that there is nothing outside of texts...\" Searle's reference here is not to anything forwarded in the debate, but to a mistranslation of the phrase \"\"il n'y a pas dehors du texte\",\" (\"There is no outside-text\") which appears in Derrida's \"Of Grammatology\".\n\nIn \"The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity\", Jürgen Habermas criticized what he considered Derrida's opposition to rational discourse.\n\nFurther, in an essay on religion and religious language, Habermas criticized Derrida's insistence on etymology and philology (see \"Etymological fallacy\").\n\nThe American philosopher Walter A. Davis, in \"Inwardness and Existence: Subjectivity in/and Hegel, Heidegger, Marx and Freud\", argues that both deconstruction and structuralism are prematurely arrested moments of a dialectical movement that issues from Hegelian \"unhappy consciousness\".\n\nPopular criticism of deconstruction intensified following the Sokal affair, which many people took as an indicator of the quality of deconstruction as a whole, despite the absence of Derrida from Sokal's follow-up book \"Impostures Intellectuelles\".\n\nChip Morningstar holds a view critical of deconstruction, believing it to be \"epistemologically challenged\". He claims the humanities are subject to isolation and genetic drift due to their unaccountability to the world outside academia. During the Second International Conference on Cyberspace (Santa Cruz, California, 1991), he reportedly heckled deconstructionists off the stage. He subsequently presented his views in the article \"How to Deconstruct Almost Anything\", where he stated, \"Contrary to the report given in the 'Hype List' column of issue #1 of Wired ('Po-Mo Gets Tek-No', page 87), we did not shout down the postmodernists. We made fun of them.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25560410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25560410", "title": "Discworld", "text": "Discworld\n\nDiscworld is a comic fantasy book series written by the English author Terry Pratchett (1948–2015), set on the Discworld, a flat planet balanced on the backs of four elephants which in turn stand on the back of a giant turtle. The books frequently parody or take inspiration from J. R. R. Tolkien, Robert E. Howard, H. P. Lovecraft, Charles Dickens and William Shakespeare, as well as mythology, folklore and fairy tales, often using them for satirical parallels with cultural, political and scientific issues.\n\nForty-one \"Discworld\" novels have been published. The original British editions of the first 26 novels, up to \"Thief of Time\" (2001), had cover art by Josh Kirby. The American editions, published by Harper Collins, used their own cover art. Since Kirby's death in 2001, the covers have been designed by Paul Kidby. Companion publications include eleven short stories (some only loosely related to the Discworld), four popular science books, and a number of supplementary books and reference guides. The series has been adapted for graphic novels, theatre, computer and board games, and television.\n\nNewly released \"Discworld\" books regularly topped \"The Sunday Times\" best-sellers list, making Pratchett the UK's best-selling author in the 1990s. \"Discworld\" novels have also won awards such as the Prometheus Award and the Carnegie Medal. In the BBC's Big Read, four \"Discworld\" novels were in the top 100, and a total of fourteen in the top 200. More than 80 million \"Discworld\" books have been sold in 37 languages.\n\nVery few of the \"Discworld\" novels have chapter divisions. Instead they feature interweaving storylines. Pratchett was quoted as saying that he \"just never got into the habit of chapters\", later adding that \"I have to shove them in the putative YA books because my editor screams until I do\". However, the first \"Discworld\" novel \"The Colour of Magic\" was divided into \"books\", as is \"Pyramids\". Additionally, \"Going Postal\" and \"Making Money\" both have chapters, a prologue, an epilogue, and brief teasers of what is to come in each chapter, in the style of A. A. Milne, Jules Verne, and Jerome K. Jerome.\n\nThe \"Discworld\" novels contain common themes and motifs that run through the series. Fantasy clichés are parodied in many of the novels, as are various subgenres of fantasy, such as fairy tales (notably \"Witches Abroad\"), witch and vampire stories (\"Carpe Jugulum\") and so on. Analogies of real-world issues, such as religion (\"Small Gods\"), fundamentalism and inner city tension (\"Thud\"), business and politics (\"Making Money\"), racial prejudice and exploitation (\"Snuff\") are recurring themes, as are aspects of culture and entertainment, such as opera (\"Maskerade\"), rock music (\"Soul Music\"), cinema (\"Moving Pictures\"), and football (\"Unseen Academicals\"). Parodies of non-Discworld fiction also occur frequently, including Shakespeare, Beatrix Potter, and several movies. Major historical events, especially battles, are sometimes used as the basis for both trivial and key events in \"Discworld\" stories (\"Jingo\", \"Pyramids\"), as are trends in science, technology, pop culture and modern art (\"Moving Pictures\", \"Men at Arms\", \"Thud\"). There are also humanist themes in many of the Discworld novels, and a focus on critical thinking skills in the Witches and Tiffany Aching series.\n\nThe \"Discworld\" novels and stories are, in principle, stand-alone works. However, a number of novels and stories form novel sequences with distinct story arcs:\n\nRincewind was the first protagonist of \"Discworld\"; a wizard with no skill, no wizardly qualifications, and no interest in heroics. He is the archetypal coward but is constantly thrust into extremely dangerous adventures. In \"The Last Hero\", he flatly states that he does \"not\" wish to join an expedition to explore over the edge of the Disc—but, being fully geared for the expedition at the time, clarifies by saying that any amount of protesting on his part is futile, as something will eventually occur that will bring him into the expedition anyway. As such, he not only constantly succeeds in staying alive, but also saves Discworld on several occasions, and has an instrumental role in the emergence of life on Roundworld (Science of Discworld).\n\nOther characters in the Rincewind story arc include: Cohen the Barbarian, an aging hero of the old fantasy tradition, out of touch with the modern world and still fighting despite his advanced age; Twoflower, a naive tourist from the Agatean Empire (inspired by cultures of the Far East, particularly Japan and China); and The Luggage, a magical, semi-sentient and exceptionally vicious multi-legged travelling accessory, made from sapient pearwood. Rincewind appeared in eight Discworld novels as well as the four Science of Discworld supplementary books.\n\nDeath appears in every novel except \"The Wee Free Men\" and \"Snuff\", although sometimes with only a few lines. As dictated by tradition, he is a seven-foot-tall skeleton in a black robe who sits astride a pale horse (called Binky). His dialogue is always depicted in , and without quotation marks, as several characters state that Death's voice seems to arrive in their heads without actually passing through their ears as sound.\n\nAs the anthropomorphic personification of death, Death has the job of guiding souls onward from this world into the next. Over millennia in the role, he has developed a fascination with humanity, even going so far as to create a house for himself in his personal dimension.\n\nCharacters that often appear with Death include his butler Albert; his granddaughter Susan Sto Helit; the Death of Rats, the part of Death in charge of gathering the souls of rodents; Quoth, a talking raven (a parody of Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Raven\", although it flat-out refuses to say \"Nevermore\"); and the Auditors of Reality, personifications of the orderly physical laws and the closest thing Death has to a nemesis. Death or Susan appear as the main characters in five Discworld novels. He also appears in the short stories \"Death and What Comes Next\", \"Theatre of Cruelty\" and \"Turntables of the Night\".\n\nDeath also appears in the non-Discworld novel \"Good Omens\", written by Pratchett and Neil Gaiman.\n\nIn Soul Music, when asked about things he enjoys he answers, \"Cats and curries\".\n\nWitches in Pratchett's universe are largely stripped of their modern occultist associations (though Pratchett does frequently use his stories to lampoon such conceptions of witchcraft), and act as herbalists, adjudicators and wise women. That is not to say that witches on the Disc cannot use magic; they simply prefer not to, finding simple but cunningly applied psychology (often referred to as \"headology\", or sometimes \"boffo\") far more effective.\n\nThe principal witch in the series is Granny Weatherwax, who at first glance seems to be a taciturn, bitter old crone, from the small mountain country of Lancre. She largely despises people but takes on the role of their healer and protector because no one else can do the job as well as she can. Her closest friend is Nanny Ogg, a jolly, personable witch with the \"common touch\" who enjoys a smoke and a pint of beer, often leading to her singing bawdy folk songs including the notorious \"Hedgehog Song\". The two take on apprentice witches, initially Magrat Garlick, then Agnes Nitt, and then Tiffany Aching, who in turn go on to become accomplished witches in their own right, and, in Magrat's case, Queen of Lancre.\n\nOther characters in the Witches series include: King Verence II of Lancre, a onetime Fool; Jason Ogg, Nanny Ogg's eldest son and local blacksmith; Shawn Ogg, Nanny's youngest son who serves as his country's entire army and civil service; and Nanny's murderous cat Greebo. The witches have appeared in numerous Discworld books, but have featured as protagonists in seven. They have also appeared in the short story \"The Sea and Little Fishes\". Their stories frequently draw on ancient European folklore and fairy tales, as well as parody famous works of literature, particularly by Shakespeare.\n\nThe stories featuring the Ankh-Morpork City Watch are urban fantasy, and frequently show the clashes that result when a traditional, magically run fantasy world such as the Disc comes into contact with modern technology and civilization. They revolve around the growth of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch from a hopeless gang of three to a fully equipped and efficient police force. The stories are largely police procedurals, featuring crimes that have heavy political or societal overtones.\n\nThe main character is Sam Vimes, a haggard, cynical, working-class street copper who, when introduced in \"Guards! Guards!\", is the drunken/alcoholic Captain of the 2-person Night Watch: lazy, cowardly, and none-too-bright Sergeant Fred Colon, and Corporal Nobby Nobbs, a petty thief in his own right. Then Carrot Ironfoundersson, a 6-foot-6-inch-tall (1.98 m) dwarf-by-adoption, comes down from the mountains to join the Watch and do real policing. The Night Watch manages to save the city from a dragon, we learn that Carrot is possibly the rightful heir to the throne of Ankh-Morpork, and the Patrician decides to allow Vimes to create a real police force.\n\nOther main characters include Angua, a werewolf; Detritus, a troll; Reg Shoe, a zombie and Dead Rights campaigner; Cuddy, a Dwarf who appears in \"Men at Arms\"; Golem Constable Dorfl; Cheery Littlebottom, the Watch's forensics expert, who is one of the first dwarves to be openly female (and who tried to rename herself \"Cheri\", but without success); Sam's wife, Lady Sybil Vimes (née Ramkin); Constable Visit-the-infidel-with-explanatory-pamphlets; Inspector A E Pessimal, recruited by Vimes as his adjutant when sent as an auditor by Havelock Vetinari, the Patrician of Ankh-Morpork. The City Watch have starred in eight Discworld stories, and have cameoed in a number of others, including \"Making Money\", the children's book \"Where's My Cow?,\" and the short story \"Theatre of Cruelty\".\n\nPratchett stated on numerous occasions that the presence of the City Watch makes Ankh-Morpork stories 'problematic', as stories set in the city that do not directly involve Vimes and the Watch often \"require\" a Watch presence to maintain the story—at which point, it becomes a Watch story by default.\n\nThe Wizards of the Unseen University (UU) have represented a strong thread through many of the \"Discworld\" novels, although the only books that they star in exclusively are The Science of the Discworld series and the novels \"Unseen Academicals\" and \"The Last Continent\". In the early books, the faculty of UU changed frequently, as rising to the top usually involved assassination. However, with the ascension of the bombastic Mustrum Ridcully to the position of Archchancellor, the hierarchy has settled and characters have been given the chance to develop. The earlier books featuring the wizards also frequently dealt with the possible invasion of the Discworld by the creatures from the Dungeon Dimensions, Lovecraftian monsters that hunger for the magic and potential of the Discworld.\n\nThe wizards of UU employ the traditional \"whizz-bang\" type of magic seen in \"Dungeons & Dragons\" games, but also investigate the rules and structure of magic in terms highly reminiscent of particle physics. Prominent members include Ponder Stibbons, a geeky young wizard; Hex, the Disc's first computer/semi-sentient thinking engine; the Librarian, who was turned into an orangutan by magical accident; the Dean; the Bursar; the Chair of Indefinite Studies; the Lecturer in Recent Runes; and the Senior Wrangler. In later novels, Rincewind also joins their group, while the Dean leaves to become the Archchancellor of Brazeneck College in the nearby city of Pseudopolis.\n\nThe Wizards have featured prominently in nine \"Discworld\" books as well as starred in The Science of Discworld series and the short story \"A Collegiate Casting-Out of Devilish Devices\".\n\nTiffany Aching is a young apprentice witch and protagonist of a series of Discworld books aimed at young adults. Her stories often parallel mythic heroes' quests, but also deal with Tiffany's difficulties as a young girl maturing into a responsible woman. She is aided in her task by the Nac Mac Feegle, a gang of blue-tattooed, 6-inch tall, hard-drinking, loud-mouthed pictsie creatures also called \"The Wee Free Men\" who serve as her guardians. Both Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg have also appeared in her stories. She has appeared in five novels (\"The Wee Free Men\", \"A Hat Full of Sky\", \"Wintersmith\", \"I Shall Wear Midnight\", and \"The Shepherd's Crown\"). Major characters in this series include Miss Tick, who discovered Tiffany, Annagramma Hawkin, Petulia Gristle, and Nac Mac Feegle chieftain Rob Anybody.\n\nMoist von Lipwig is a professional criminal and con man to whom Havelock Vetinari gives a \"second chance\" after staging his execution, recognising the advantages his jack-of-all-trades abilities would have to the development of the city. After setting him in charge of the Ankh-Morpork Post Office in \"Going Postal\", to good result, Vetinari ordered him to clear up the city's corrupt financial sector in \"Making Money\". In a third book, \"Raising Steam\", published on 7 November 2013, Vetinari persuades Lipwig to oversee the development of a rail network for Dick Simnel's newly invented steam locomotive. Other characters in this series include Adora Belle Dearheart, Lipwig's acerbic, chain-smoking love interest; Gladys, a golem who develops a strange crush on Lipwig; Stanley Howler, an obsessive young man who was raised by peas and becomes the Disc's first stamp collector; and the very old Junior Postman Groat, who never got promoted to Senior Postman because there was never a Postmaster alive long enough to do so.\n\nSeveral other books can be grouped together as \"Other cultures of Discworld\" books. They may contain characters or locations from other arcs, typically not as protagonist or antagonist but as a supporting character or even a throwaway reference. These include \"Pyramids\" (Djelibeybi), \"Small Gods\" (Omnia), and \"Monstrous Regiment\" (Zlobenia and Borogravia).\n\nShort descriptions of many of the notable characters:\n\nThere are also a number of short stories by Pratchett based in the Discworld, including published miscellanea such as the fictional game origins of \"Thud\". All are available in the anthology \"A Blink of the Screen\" (2012) as well as in the following locations:\n\n\nSeven of the short stories or short writings were also collected in a compilation of the majority of Pratchett's known short work named \"Once More* With Footnotes\" (2004).\n\nAdditionally, another short story \"Turntables of the Night\" (1989) is set in England but features Death as a character; it is available online and in both anthologies.\n\nAlthough Terry Pratchett said, \"There are no maps. You can't map a sense of humour,\" there are four \"Mapps\": \"The Streets of Ankh-Morpork\" (1993), \"The Discworld Mapp\" (1995), \"A Tourist Guide to Lancre\" (1998), and \"Death's Domain\" (1999). The first two were drawn by Stephen Player, based on plans by Pratchett and Stephen Briggs, the third is a collaboration between Briggs and Kidby, and the last is by Paul Kidby. All also contain booklets written by Pratchett and Briggs.\n\nPratchett also collaborated with Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen on four books, using the Discworld to illuminate popular science topics. Each book alternates chapters of a \"Discworld\" story and notes on real science related to it. The books are:\n\n\nDavid Langford has compiled two \"Discworld\" quiz books:\n\n\nMost years see the release of a Discworld Diary and Discworld Calendar, both usually following a particular theme.\n\nThe diaries feature background information about their themes. Some topics are later used in the series; the character of Miss Alice Band first appeared in the \"Assassins' Guild Yearbook\", for example.\n\n\"The Discworld Almanak – The Year of The Prawn\" has a similar format and general contents to the diaries.\n\nOther \"Discworld\" publications include:\n\n\nThe books take place roughly in real time and the characters' ages change to reflect the passing of years. The meetings of various characters from different narrative threads (e.g., Ridcully and Granny Weatherwax in \"Lords and Ladies\", Rincewind and Carrot in \"The Last Hero\") indicate that all the main storylines take place around the same period (end of the Century of the Fruitbat, beginning of the Century of the Anchovy). The main exception is the stand-alone book \"Small Gods\", which appears to take place at some point earlier than most of the other stories, though even this contains cameo appearances by Death and the Librarian.\n\nSome main characters may make cameo appearances in other books where they are not the primary focus; for example, City Watch members Carrot Ironfoundersson and Angua appear briefly in \"Going Postal\", \"Making Money\", and \"Unseen Academicals\" (placing those books after \"Guards! Guards!\" and \"Men at Arms\"). A number of characters, such as members of staff of Unseen University and Lord Vetinari, appear prominently in many different storylines without having specific storylines of their own.\n\nAfter Terry Pratchett was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, he said that he would be happy for his daughter Rhianna to continue the series. Rhianna Pratchett said that she would only be involved in spin-offs, adaptations and tie-ins, and that there would be no more novels.\n\nMost of Pratchett's novels have been released as audio cassette and CD audiobooks. \n\n\"The Colour of Magic\", \"The Light Fantastic\", \"Mort\", and \"Guards! Guards!\", \"Small Gods\" have been adapted into graphic novels.\n\nDue in part to the complexity of the novels, \"Discworld\" has been difficult to adapt to film – Pratchett was fond of an anecdote of a producer attempting to pitch an adaptation of \"Mort\" in the early 1990s but was told to \"lose the Death angle\" by US backers.\n\nThe adaptations include:\n\nPlanned adaptations include:\n\nThere have been several BBC radio adaptations of Discworld stories, including:\n\n\nVarious other types of related merchandise have been produced by cottage industries with an interest in the books, including Stephen Briggs, Bernard Pearson, Bonsai Trading, Paul Kidby and Clarecraft.\n\n\n\n\n\nPratchett co-authored with Phil Masters two role-playing game supplements for Discworld, utilising the GURPS system:\n\n\n\nSeveral \"Discworld\" locations have been twinned with real world towns and cities. Wincanton, in Somerset, UK, for example is twinned with Ankh-Morpork, and the town is the first to name streets after their fictional equivalents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "210085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=210085", "title": "Genre fiction", "text": "Genre fiction\n\nGenre fiction, also known as popular fiction, is a term used in the book-trade for fictional works written with the intent of fitting into a specifically literary genre, in order to appeal to readers and fans already familiar with that genre. \n\nAlthough Genre fiction is generally distinguished from literary fiction, a number of major literary figures have also written genre fiction, for example, John Banville, publishes crime novels as Benjamin Black, and both Doris Lessing, and Margaret Atwood have written science fiction. Georges Simenon, the creator of the Maigret detective novels, has been described by André Gide as \"the most novelistic of novelists in French literature\".\n\nThe main genres are crime, fantasy, romance, science fiction, western, inspirational, historical fiction and horror. More commercially oriented genre fiction has been dismissed by literary critics as poorly written or escapist.\n\nIn the publishing industry the term \"category fiction\" is often used as a synonym for genre fiction, with the categories serving as the familiar shelf headings within the fiction section of a bookstore, such as Western or mystery.\n\nThe uncategorized section is known in the industry as \"general fiction\", but in fact many of the titles in this usually large section are often themselves genre novels that have been placed in the general section because sellers believe they will appeal, due to their high quality or other special characteristics, to a wider audience than merely the readers of that genre.\n\nAdult fans are often embarrassed to read genre fiction in public, but authors known for literary fiction have written novels under pseudonyms. With the demise of the hardback book, distinctions between genre fiction and literary fiction may begin to blur, with appropriate changes in marketing.\n\nThough a production not promoted by secondary criticism it is popular literature that holds the largest market share. Romance fiction had an estimated $1.375 billion share in the US book market in 2007. Religion/inspirational literature followed with $819 million, science fiction/fantasy with $700 million, mystery with $650 million and then classic literary fiction with $466 million.\n\nGenre began as an absolute classification system for ancient Greek literature. Poetry, prose, and drama each had a specific and calculated style that related to the theme of the story. Among the genres were the epic in poetry and tragedy and comedy for plays. In later periods other genres such as the chivalric romance, opera, and prose fiction developed.\n\nThough the novel is often seen as a modern genre, Ian Watt, in \"The Rise of the Novel\" (1957) suggests that the novel first came into being in the early 18th century, it has also been described as possessing \"a continuous and comprehensive history of about two thousand years\", from the time of both Classical Greece and Rome.\n\nThe \"romance\" is a closely related long prose narrative. Walter Scott defined it as \"a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents\", whereas in the novel \"the events are accommodated to the ordinary train of human events and the modern state of society\". However, many romances, including the historical romances of Scott, Emily Brontë's \"Wuthering Heights\" and Herman Melville's \"Moby-Dick\", are also frequently called novels, and Scott describes romance as a \"kindred term\". Romance, as defined here, should not be confused with the genre fiction love romance or romance novel. Other European languages do not distinguish between romance and novel: \"a novel is \"le roman\", \"der Roman\", \"il romanzo\".\"\n\nGenre fiction developed from various subgenres of the novel (and its \"romance\" version) during the nineteenth century, along with the growth of the mass-marketing of fiction in the twentieth century: this includes the gothic novel, fantasy, science fiction, adventure novel, historical romance, and the detective novel. Some scholars see precursors to the genre fiction romance novels in literary fiction of the 18th and 19th centuries, including Samuel Richardson's sentimental novel \"Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded\" (1740) and the novels of Jane Austen such as \"Pride and Prejudice\" (1813).\n\nThe following are some of the main genres as they are used in contemporary publishing:\n\nCrime fiction is the literary genre that fictionalises crimes, their detection, criminals, and their motives. It is usually distinguished from mainstream fiction and other genres such as historical fiction or science fiction, but the boundaries are indistinct. Crime fiction has multiple subgenres, including detective fiction (such as the whodunit), courtroom drama, hard-boiled fiction, mystery fiction, and legal thrillers. Suspense and mystery are key elements to the genre.\n\nFantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in imaginary worlds where magic and magical creatures are common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap among the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. In popular culture, the fantasy genre predominantly features a medieval-type setting.\n\nThe romance novel or \"romantic novel\" primarily focuses on the relationship and romantic love between two people, and must have an \"emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending.\" There are many subgenres of the romance novel including fantasy, historical, science fiction, same sex romantic fiction, and paranormal fiction.\n\nThere is a literary fiction form of romance, which Walter Scott defined as \"a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents\".\n\nAccording to \"Romance Writers of America\" data, the most important subgenres are: Contemporary series romance, Contemporary romance, Historical romance, Paranormal romance, Romantic suspense, Inspirational romance, Romantic suspense (series).\n\nScience fiction is a genre of speculative fiction dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \"literature of ideas\". It usually eschews the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have at least pretense of science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection has become tenuous or non-existent in much of science fiction.\n\nWestern fiction is defined primarily by being set in the American West in the second half of the 19th century and, secondarily, by featuring heroes who are rugged, individualistic horsemen (cowboys). Other genres, such as romance, have subgenres that make use of the Western setting.\n\nInspirational fiction is fictional works with faith-based themes. It may be targeted at a specific demographic, such as Christians. Modern inspirational fiction has grown to encompass non-traditional subgenres, such as inspirational thrillers.\n\nHorror fiction aims to frighten or disgust its readers. Although many horror novels feature supernatural phenomena or monsters, it is not required. Early horror took much inspiration from Romanticism and Gothic fiction. Modern horror, such as cosmic horror and splatterpunk, tends to be less melodramatic and more explicit. Horror is often mixed with other genres.\n\nAlthough frequently ignored or ridiculed by literary critics, genre fiction has achieved a measure of acceptance among some modern critics, with Stephen King being awarded the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters; but this polarized opinions and led to debate on genre fiction's literary merit. Negative comments about genre fiction have sparked responses from \"Time\", \"Salon\", \"the Atlantic\", and the \"Los Angeles Review of Books\". Nobel laureate Doris Lessing described science fiction as \"some of the best social fiction of our time\", and called Greg Bear, author of \"Blood Music\", \"a great writer\". \n\nA number of major literary figures have written works of genre fiction. Graham Greene at the time of his death in 1991 had a reputation as a writer of both deeply serious novels on the theme of Catholicism, and of \"suspense-filled stories of detection\". Acclaimed during his lifetime, he was shortlisted in 1966 for the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nIn the 2000s, the BBC defended itself against charges that it had sneered at genre fiction, while the Man Booker and National Book Awards have been criticized for ignoring genre fiction in their selection process. \n\nSome critics have claimed that reading romance and suspense thrillers makes readers more sensitive, because these novels focus on interpersonal relationships.\n\nSir John Barrow's descriptive 1831 account of the Mutiny on the Bounty immortalised the Royal Navy ship and her people. The legend of Dick Turpin was popularised when the 18th-century English highwayman's exploits appeared in the novel \"Rookwood\" in 1834.\n\nAlthough pre-dated by John Ruskin's \"The King of the Golden River\" in 1841, the history of the modern fantasy genre is generally said to begin with George MacDonald, the influential author of \"The Princess and the Goblin\" and \"Phantastes\" (1858). William Morris was a popular English poet who also wrote several fantasy novels during the latter part of the nineteenth century. Wilkie Collins' epistolary novel \"The Moonstone\" (1868), is generally considered the first detective novel in the English language, while \"The Woman in White\" is regarded as one of the finest sensation novels. H. G. Wells's (1866–1946) writing career began in the 1890s with science fiction novels like \"The Time Machine\" (1895), and \"The War of the Worlds\" (1898) which describes an invasion of late Victorian England by Martians, and Wells is seen, along with Frenchman Jules Verne (1828–1905), as a major figure in the development of the science fiction genre. He also wrote realistic fiction about the lower middle class in novels like \"Kipps\" (1905) and \"The History of Mr Polly\" (1910).\n\nPenny dreadful publications were an alternative to mainstream works, and were aimed at working class adolescents, introducing the infamous Sweeney Todd. The premier ghost story writer of the 19th century was the Irish writer Sheridan Le Fanu. His works include the macabre mystery novel \"Uncle Silas\" 1865, and his Gothic novella \"Carmilla\" 1872, tells the story of a young woman's susceptibility to the attentions of a female vampire. The vampire genre fiction began with John William Polidori's \"The Vampyre\" (1819). This short story was inspired by the life of Lord Byron and his poem \"The Giaour\". An important later work is \"Varney the Vampire\" (1845), where many standard vampire conventions originated: Varney has fangs, leaves two puncture wounds on the neck of his victims, and has hypnotic powers and superhuman strength. Varney was also the first example of the \"sympathetic vampire\", who loathes his condition but is a slave to it. Bram Stoker, yet another Irish writer, was the author of seminal horror work \"Dracula\" and featured as its primary antagonist the vampire Count Dracula, with the vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing his arch-enemy. \"Dracula\" has been attributed to a number of literary genres including vampire literature, horror fiction, gothic novel and invasion literature.\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes is a brilliant London-based \"consulting detective\", famous for his intellectual prowess, skilful use of astute observation, deductive reasoning and forensic skills to solve difficult cases. Holmes' archenemy Professor Moriarty, is widely considered to be the first true example of a supervillain, while Sherlock Holmes has become a by-word for a detective. Conan Doyle wrote four novels and fifty-six short stories featuring Holmes, from 1880 up to 1907, with a final case in 1914. All but four Conan Doyle stories are narrated by Holmes' friend, assistant, and biographer, Dr John H. Watson.\n\nThe Lost World literary genre was inspired by real stories of archaeological discoveries by imperial adventurers. H. Rider Haggard wrote one of the earliest examples, \"King Solomon's Mines\" in 1885. Contemporary European politics and diplomatic manoeuvrings informed Anthony Hope's swashbuckling Ruritanian adventure novels \"The Prisoner of Zenda\" 1894, and \"Rupert of Hentzau\", 1898.\n\nF. Anstey's comic novel \"Vice Versa\" 1882, sees a father and son magically switch bodies. Satirist Jerome K. Jerome's \"Three Men in a Boat\" 1889, is a humorous account of a boating holiday on the river Thames. Grossmith brothers George & Weedon's \"Diary of a Nobody\" 1892, is also considered a classic work of humour.\n\nErskine Childers' \"The Riddle of the Sands\" (1903), defined the spy novel and Follett has also called it \"the first modern thriller\".\n\nEmma Orczy's \"The Scarlet Pimpernel\" (1903) was originally a highly successful play, when staged in London in 1905. The novel \"The Scarlet Pimpernel\" was published soon after the play opened and was an immediate success. Orczy gained a following of readers in Britain and throughout the world. The popularity of the novel, which recounted the adventures of a member of the English gentry in the French Revolutionary period, encouraged her to write a number of sequels for her \"reckless daredevil\" over the next 35 years. The play was performed to great acclaim in France, Italy, Germany and Spain, while the novel was translated into 16 languages. Subsequently, the story has been adapted for television, film, a musical and other media. Baroness Orczy's character \"The Old Man in the Corner\" (1908) was among the earliest armchair detectives to be created. Her short stories about \"Lady Molly of Scotland Yard\" (1910) were an early example of a female detective as main character.\n\nJohn Buchan wrote the adventure novels on \"Prester John\" (1910) and four novels telling the adventures of Richard Hannay, of which the first, \"The Thirty-Nine Steps\" (1915) is the best known. Novels featuring a gentleman adventurer were popular in the interwar period, exemplified by the series of H. C. McNeile with \"Bulldog Drummond\" (1920), and Leslie Charteris, whose many books chronicled the adventures of Simon Templar, alias \"The Saint\".\n\nThe medievalist scholar M. R. James wrote highly regarded ghost stories (1904–1928) in contemporary settings.\n\nThis was called the Golden Age of Detective Fiction. Agatha Christie, a writer of crime novels, short stories and plays, is best remembered for her 80 detective novels and her successful West End theatre plays. Christie's works, particularly those featuring the detectives Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple, made her one of the most important and innovative writers in the development of the genre. Her most influential novels include \"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\" (1926); one of her most controversial novels, its innovative twist ending had a significant impact on the genre), \"Murder on the Orient Express\" (1934), \"Death on the Nile\" (1937) and \"And Then There Were None\" (1939). Other female writers dubbed \"Queens of crime\" include Dorothy L. Sayers (gentleman detective, Lord Peter Wimsey), Margery Allingham (Albert Campion, supposedly created as a parody of Sayers' Wimsey,) and New Zealander Ngaio Marsh (Roderick Alleyn). Georgette Heyer recreated the historical romance genre since 1921, and also wrote detective fiction (1932–1953).\n\nA major work of science fiction, from the early 20th century, is \"A Voyage to Arcturus\" by Scottish writer David Lindsay, first published in 1920. It combines fantasy, philosophy, and science fiction in an exploration of the nature of good and evil and their relationship with existence. It has been described by critic and philosopher Colin Wilson as the \"greatest novel of the twentieth century\", and was a central influence on C. S. Lewis's \"Space Trilogy\". Also J. R. R. Tolkien said he read the book \"with avidity\", and praised it as a work of philosophy, religion, and morality. It was made widely available in paperback form when published as one of the precursor volumes to the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series in 1968.\n\nFrom the early 1930s to late 1940s, an informal literary discussion group associated with the English faculty at the University of Oxford, were the \"Inklings\". Its leading members were the major fantasy novelists; C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien. Lewis is known for \"The Screwtape Letters\" (1942), \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" (1950–1956) and \"The Space Trilogy\" (1938–1945), while Tolkien is best known as the author of \"The Hobbit\" (1937), \"The Lord of the Rings\" (1954–1955), and \"The Silmarillion\" (1977).\n\nIn thriller writing, Ian Fleming created the character James Bond 007 in January 1952, while on holiday at his Jamaican estate, Goldeneye. Fleming chronicled Bond's adventures in twelve novels, including \"Casino Royale\" (1953), \"Live and Let Die\" (1954), \"Dr. No\" (1958), \"Goldfinger\" (1959), \"Thunderball\" (1961), \"The Spy Who Loved Me\" (1962), and nine short story works.\n\nIn contrast to the larger-than-life spy capers of Bond, John le Carré was an author of spy novels who depicted a shadowy world of espionage and counter-espionage, and his best known novel \"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\" (1963), is often regarded as one of the greatest in the genre. Frederick Forsyth writes thriller novels, including \"The Day of the Jackal\" (1971), \"The Odessa File\" (1972), \"The Dogs of War\" (1974) and \"The Fourth Protocol\" (1984). Ken Follett writes spy thrillers, his first success being \"Eye of the Needle\" (1978), followed by \"The Key to Rebecca\" (1980), as well as historical novels, notably \"The Pillars of the Earth\" (1989), and its sequel \"World Without End\" (2007). Elleston Trevor is remembered for his 1964 adventure story \"The Flight of the Phoenix\", while the thriller novelist Philip Nicholson is best known for \"Man on Fire\". Peter George's \"Red Alert\" (1958), is a Cold War thriller.\n\nWar novels include Alistair MacLean thriller's \"The Guns of Navarone\" (1957), \"Where Eagles Dare\" (1968), and Jack Higgins' \"The Eagle Has Landed\" (1975). Patrick O'Brian's nautical historical novels feature the \"Aubrey–Maturin series\" set in the Royal Navy, the first being \"Master and Commander\" (1969).\n\nThe \"father of Wicca\", Gerald Gardner, began propagating his own version of witchcraft in the 1950s. Having claimed to have been initiated into the New Forest coven in 1939, Gardner published his books \"Witchcraft Today\" (1954) and \"The Meaning of Witchcraft\" (1959), the foundational texts for the religion of Wicca. Ronald Welch's Carnegie Medal winning novel \"Knight Crusader\" is set in the 12th century and gives a depiction of the Third Crusade, featuring the Christian leader and King of England Richard the Lionheart.\n\nIn crime fiction, the murder mysteries of Ruth Rendell and P. D. James are popular.\n\nNigel Tranter wrote historical novels of celebrated Scottish warriors; Robert the Bruce in \"The Bruce Trilogy\", and William Wallace in \"The Wallace\" (1975), works noted by academics for their accuracy.\n\nJohn Wyndham wrote post-apocalyptic science fiction, his most notable works being \"The Day of the Triffids\" (1951), and \"The Midwich Cuckoos\" (1957). George Langelaan's \"The Fly\" (1957), is a science fiction short story. Science fiction novelist Arthur C. Clarke's \"\" (1968), is based on his various short stories, particularly \"The Sentinel\" (1951). His other major novels include \"Rendezvous with Rama\" (1972), and \"The Fountains of Paradise\" (1979). Brian Aldiss is Clarke's contemporary.\n\nMichael Moorcock (born 1939) is a writer, primarily of science fiction and fantasy, who has also published a number of literary novels. He was involved with the 'New Wave' of science fiction writers \"part of whose aim was to invest the genre with literary merit\" Similarly J. G. Ballard (born 1930) \"became known in the 1960s as the most prominent of the 'New Wave' science fiction writers\". A later major figure in science fiction was Iain M. Banks who created a fictional anarchist, socialist, and utopian society named \"The Culture\". The novels that feature in it include \"Excession\" (1996), and \"Inversions\" (1998). He also published mainstream novels, including the highly controversial \"The Wasp Factory\" in 1984. Nobel prize winner Doris Lessing also published a sequence of five science fiction novels the \"Canopus in Argos: Archives\" between 1979 and 1983.\n\nTerry Pratchett is best known for his \"Discworld\" series of comic fantasy novels, that begins with \"The Colour of Magic\" (1983), and includes \"Mort\" (1987), \"Hogfather\" (1996), and \"Night Watch\" (2002). Pratchett's other most notable work is the 1990 novel \"Good Omens\".\n\nPhilip Pullman's fantasy trilogy \"His Dark Materials\" comprises \"Northern Lights\" (1995), \"The Subtle Knife\" (1997), and \"The Amber Spyglass\" (2000). It follows the coming-of-age of two children as they wander through a series of parallel universes against a backdrop of epic events.\n\nNeil Gaiman is a writer of science fiction, fantasy short stories and novels, whose notable works include \"Stardust\" (1998), \"Coraline\" (2002), \"The Graveyard Book\" (2009), and \"The Sandman\" series.\n\nAlan Moore's works include \"Watchmen\", \"V for Vendetta\" set in a dystopian future UK, \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\", and \"From Hell\", speculating on the identity and motives of Jack the Ripper.\n\nDouglas Adams wrote the five-volume science fiction comedy series \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\", and also wrote the humorous fantasy detective novel \"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency\".\n\nClive Barker horror novels include \"The Hellbound Heart\" (1986), and works in fantasy, \"Weaveworld\" (1987), \"Imajica\" and \"Abarat\" (2002).\n\nMost genres of fiction may also be segmented by the age of the intended reader:\n\n"}

{"id": "844136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=844136", "title": "Gucci", "text": "Gucci\n\nGucci (, ; ) is an Italian luxury brand of fashion and leather goods. Gucci was founded by Guccio Gucci in Florence in 1921.\nGucci generated about €4.2 billion in revenue worldwide in 2008 according to \"BusinessWeek\" and climbed to 41st position in the magazine's annual 2009 \"Top Global 100 Brands\" chart created by Interbrand; it retained that rank in Interbrand's 2014 index. Gucci is also the highest-selling Italian brand.\n\nGucci operates about 278 directly operated stores worldwide as of September 2009, and it wholesales its products through franchisees and upscale department stores. In the year 2013, the brand was valued at US$12.1 billion, with sales of US$4.7 billion. In the \"Forbes\" World's Most Valuable Brands list, Gucci is ranked the 38th most valuable brand, with a brand value of $12.4 billion as of May 2015. As of January 2015, the creative director is Alessandro Michele.\n\nWith beginnings at the end of the 19th century, the Gucci company became one of the world’s most successful manufacturers of high-end leather goods, clothing, and other fashion products. As an immigrant hotel worker in Paris and later London, young Guccio Gucci (1881–1953) was impressed with the luxurious luggage he saw urbane guests bring with them. Before leaving, he visited the manufacturer, H.J. Cave & Sons. Upon returning to his birthplace of Florence, a city distinguished for high-quality materials and skilled artisans, he established a shop in 1920 that sold fine leather goods with classic styling. Although Gucci organized his workrooms for industrial methods of production, he maintained traditional aspects of fabrication. Initially, Gucci employed skilled workers in basic Florentine leather crafts, attentive to finishing. With expansion, machine stitching was a production method that supported construction.\n\nTogether with three of his sons, Aldo Gucci (1905–1990), Vasco Gucci (1907–1975), and Rodolfo Gucci (1912–1983), Gucci expanded the company to include stores in Milan and Rome as well as additional shops in Florence. Gucci's stores featured such finely crafted leather accessories as handbags, shoes, and his iconic ornamented loafer as well as silks and knitwear in a signature pattern.\n\nThe company made handbags of cotton canvas rather than leather during World War II as a result of material shortages. The canvas, however, was distinguished by a signature double-G symbol combined with prominent red and green bands. After the war, the Gucci crest, which showed a shield and armored knight surrounded by a ribbon inscribed with the family name, became synonymous with the city of Florence.\n\nAldo and Rodolfo Gucci further expanded the company's horizons in 1953 by establishing offices in New York City. Film stars and jet-set travelers to Italy during the 1950s and 1960s brought their glamour to Florence, turning Gucci's merchandise into international status symbols. Movie stars posed in Gucci's clothing, accessories, and footwear for lifestyle magazines around the world, contributing to the company’s growing reputation.\n\nGucci's distinctive lines made its products among the most frequently copied in the world in the early 2000s. Pigskin, calf, and imported exotic animal skins were subjected to various methods of fabrication. Waterproof canvas and satin were used for evening bags. Bamboo was first used to make handbag handles by a process of heating and molding in 1947, and purses made with a shoulder strap and snaffle-bit decoration were introduced in 1960. In 1964 Gucci’s lush butterfly pattern was custom-created for silk foulards, followed by equally luxuriant floral patterns. The original Gucci loafer was updated by a distinctive snaffle-bit ornament in 1966, while the \"Rolls-Royce\" luggage set was introduced in 1970. Watches, jewelry, ties, and eyewear were then added to the company's product lines. A particularly iconic touch, introduced in 1964, was the use of the double-G logo for belt buckles and other accessory decorations.\n\nThe company prospered through the 1970s, but the 1980s were marked by internal family disputes that brought Gucci to the brink of disaster. Rodolfo’s son Maurizio Gucci took over the company’s direction after his father’s death in 1983 and dismissed his uncle Aldo—who eventually served a prison term for tax evasion. Maurizio proved to be an unsuccessful president; he was compelled to sell the family-owned company to Investcorp, a Bahrain-based company, in 1988. Maurizio disposed of his remaining stock in 1993. Maurizio was murdered by a hitman in Milan in 1995, and his former wife, Patrizia Reggiani, was convicted of hiring his killer. Meanwhile, the new investors promoted the American-educated Domenico De Sole from the position of family attorney to president of Gucci America in 1994 and chief executive in 1995.\n\nThe company had previously brought in Dawn Mello in 1989 as editor and ready-to-wear designer in order to reestablish its reputation. Well aware of Gucci’s tarnished image and the value of its name brand, Mello hired Tom Ford in 1990 to design a ready-to-wear line. He was promoted to the position of creative director in 1994. Before Mello returned to her post as president of the American retailer Bergdorf Goodman, she initiated the return of Gucci’s headquarters from the business center of Milan to Florence, where its craft traditions were rooted. There she and Ford reduced the number of Gucci products from 20,000 to 5,000.\n\nSteinunn Sigurdardóttir was the Director and Senior Designer for Gucci from 1995 to 2000.\n\nThere were seventy-six Gucci stores around the world in 1997, along with numerous licensing agreements. Ford was instrumental in the process of decision-making with De Sole when the Gucci Group acquired Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche, Bottega Veneta, Boucheron, Sergio Rossi, and, in part-ownership with Stella McCartney, Alexander McQueen and Balenciaga. By 2001 Ford and De Sole shared the responsibility for major business decisions, while Ford concurrently directed design at Yves Saint Laurent as well as at Gucci.\n\nThe French conglomerate Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, however, gained ownership of 60 percent of the Gucci Group’s stock in 2003. \"Women’s Wear Daily\" then announced the departure of both Domenico De Sole and Tom Ford from the Gucci Group when their contracts expired in April 2004. The last spring collection under the direction of Ford and De Sole was a critical and commercial success. Amid widespread speculation in the fashion press about Ford’s heir, the company announced in March 2004 that he would be replaced by a team of younger designers promoted from the ranks of the company’s staff.\n\nIn 2005, Frida Giannini was appointed as the creative director for women’s ready-to-wear and accessories, previously joining Gucci in 2002. In 2006, she also became the creative director for men's ready-to-wear and the entire Gucci label.\n\nAs announced in December 12, 2014, Creative Director Frida Giannini and CEO Patrizio di Marco were to step down from Gucci. Marco Bizzarri was appointed CEO of the brand.\n\nIn 2017, Bizzarri said, \"Being socially responsible is one of Gucci's core values, and we will continue to strive to do better for the environment and animals,\" and therefore fur would be banned from Gucci collections as of 2018. In August 2018, Gucci launched online operations in New Zealand.\n\nAfter being appointed Gucci's creative director in 2015, Michele reintroduced the company's double-G Marmont logo.\n\nA turnaround of the company devised in the late 1980s made Gucci a global contender and a notable fashion label. In October 1995, Gucci went public and had its first initial public offering on the AMEX and NYSE for $22 per share. November 1997 also proved to be a successful year as Gucci acquired a watch license, Severin-Montres, and renamed it Gucci Timepieces.\n\nThe firm was named \"European Company of the Year 1998\" by the European Business Press Federation for its economic and financial performance, strategic vision as well as management quality.\n\nGucci headquarters are in Florence, other world offices are in Milan, Paris, London, Hong Kong, Japan, and New York. Kering headquarters are in Paris.\n\nIn 1989, Maurizio managed to persuade Dawn Mello, whose revival of New York's Bergdorf Goodman in the 1970s made her a star in the retail business, to join the newly formed Gucci Group as Executive Vice President and Creative Director Worldwide. At the helm of Gucci America was Domenico De Sole, a former lawyer who helped oversee Maurizio's takeover of ten 1987 and 1989. The last addition to the creative team, which already included designers from Geoffrey Beene and Calvin Klein, was a young designer named Tom Ford. Raised in Texas and New Mexico, he had been interested in fashion since his early teens but only decided to pursue a career as a designer after dropping out of Parsons School of Design in 1986 as an architecture major. Dawn Mello hired Ford in 1990 at the urging of his partner, writer and editor Richard Buckley.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Gucci underwent what is now recognized as the poorest time in the company's history. Maurizio riled distributors, Investcorp shareholders, and executives at Gucci America by drastically reining in on the sales of the Gucci Accessories Collection, which in the United States alone generated $110 million in revenue every year. The company’s new accessories failed to pick up the slack, and for the next three years the company experienced heavy losses and teetered on the edge of bankruptcy. Maurizio was a charming man who passionately loved his family's business, but after four years most of the company's senior managers agreed that he was incapable of running the company. His management had had an adverse effect on the desirability of the brand, product quality, and distribution control. He was forced to sell his shares in the company to Investcorp in August 1993. Dawn Mello returned to her job at Bergdorf Goodman less than a year after Maurizio’s departure, and the position of creative director went to Tom Ford, then just 32 years old. Ford had worked for years under the direction of Maurizio and Mello and wanted to take the company’s image in a new direction. De Sole, who had been elevated to President and Chief Executive Officer of Gucci Group NV, realized that if Gucci were to become a profitable company, it would require a new image, and so he agreed to pursue Ford’s vision.\n\nIn 1998, \"Guinness World Records\" cited the Gucci \"Genius Jeans\" as the most expensive pair of jeans in existence. These jeans were distressed, ripped and covered with African beads and were offered for sale for US$3,134 in Milan. (This record was surpassed in June 2005 by Levi Strauss & Co.'s 115-year-old 501 jeans that sold to an anonymous Japanese collector for $60,000.)\n\nIn early 1999, the luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, headed by Bernard Arnault, increased its shareholdings in Gucci with a view to a takeover. Domenico De Sole was incensed by the news and declined Arnault's request for a spot on the board of directors, where he would have access to Gucci’s confidential earnings reports, strategy meetings, and design concepts. De Sole reacted by issuing new shares of stock in an effort to dilute the value of Arnault’s holdings. He also approached French holding company Pinault-Printemps-Redoute (PPR) about the possibility of forming a strategic alliance. François Pinault, the company’s founder, agreed to the idea and purchased 37 million shares in the company, or a 40% stake. Arnault’s share was diluted to a paltry 20%, and a legal battle ensued to challenge the legitimacy of the new Gucci-PPR partnership, with the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom representing Gucci. Courts in the Netherlands ultimately upheld the PPR deal, as it did not violate that country's business laws. The second largest shareholder is Crédit Lyonnais with 11%. , a settlement agreement was put into place between Gucci Group, LVMH, and PPR.\n\nFollowing Ford's departure, Gucci Group retained three designers to continue the success of the company's flagship label: John Ray, Alessandra Facchinetti and Frida Giannini, all of whom had worked under Ford's creative direction. Facchinetti was elevated to Creative Director of Women's wear in 2004 and designed for two seasons before leaving the company. Ray served as Creative Director of Menswear for three years. 32-year-old Giannini, who had been responsible for designing men's and women's accessories, served as Creative Director for the entire brand.\n\nIn 2006, Frida Giannini, formerly Creative Director of accessories, was named sole Creative Director. In 2009, Patrizio di Marco replaced Mark Lee as CEO of Gucci.\n\nMarco Bizzarri was appointed CEO of the brand as announced on December 12, 2014, and Alessandro Michele became Gucci's Creative Director on January 21, 2015.\n\nIn April 2016, Susan Chokachi was promoted to the role of President and Chief Executive Officer of Gucci America, having previously held the role of Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications.\n\nFrom 2016, Gucci's Internet presence has grown with more people searching for the brand online. In 2017, the brand saw a 115% increase in growth, with over $61,798,514 earned in media value. Furthermore, the fashion house saw a 44.5% increase in revenues in the nine months ending 30th September 2017. This growth can be linked to the success of their digital marketing strategies, which has allowed the brand to integrate the digital world to the in-store experience, and communicate to a larger target audience. Gucci saw a 130% web traffic increase from 1.8M site visits in January 2017 to 4.2M visits in December 2017.\nGucci has focused on the online shopping experience, creating a sense of digital inspiration by including visually rich large images and videos, with information on current fashion collections in the editorial section \"The Agenda\". The company has actively frequently uploaded posts of behind the scenes, with information on the patterns and styles, which highlight the craftsmanship of each product design. This has allowed consumers to gain a stronger emotional relationship with the brand. \n\nGucci has a strong digital presence online, and is heavily active across various social media platforms with the brand name: Gucci. These include Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Google+, Pinterest, and Snapchat. In 2017, the brand was seen to be the most-discussed brand on social media within the high-end luxury market. The brand has integrated itself into the modern digital world with campaigns such as the 'collaborative art project'. This campaign was to market a new line of watches, in which the brand collaborated with artists and popular Instagram meme accounts. Memes can be defined as a joke, fad or memorable piece of content that spreads across the web and is usually accompanied by a witty caption. For Gucci, the brand focused on Instagram ads, where they reimagined popular memes with their watch collection, prompting users to share and tag their friends. Despite the conversation and shares, the campaign was not wildly successful, with many viewers reacting negatively to the content.\n\nGucci has created strong partnerships with Hollywood celebrities and social media influencers, working closely with these individuals to reach more demographics and re-establish its identity as a new, modern brand; despite the fact that it has been around for a while. The brand has changed directions in working with the type of celebrities, with Gucci now dressing contemporary style icons like Rihanna, Blake Lively, Brad Pitt, Rachel McAdams, Harry Styles and Salma Hayek, who can be easily resonated with millennials. \n\nAlong with this, Gucci has worked closely with internet stars and has transformed many up and coming Instagram users into luxury-brand stars. These collaborations have been proven to be successful due to the associations with opinion leaders who try to influence the purchasing behaviours of opinion seekers, who are actively searching for information to assist with their purchasing behaviours and decisions. As research has found that consumers make purchases based on what they mean and see items as a sense of their extended self, this form of word-of-mouth marketing can be used to influence the brand's meaning and thus, influence the probability of purchases.\n\nGucci's Summer 2018 collection featured a collaboration with Sega.\n\nIn June 2012, Gucci won a trademark lawsuit against Guess with an award of $4.7 million in damages.\nOn 16 October 2013, Gucci won a trademark counterfeiting and cybersquatting lawsuit, in US federal district court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, against several online businesses. Gucci won permanent injunction, the \"immediate surrender to Gucci of 155 domain names used in the counterfeiting operation\", and an award of USD $144.2 million, which includes interest.\n\nOn 5 November 2013, the UK's Intellectual Property Office issued a ruling that Gucci has lost the rights to its GG trademark in the UK \"to a version of the GG logo in four categories, which encompassed garments such as bracelets, shoulder bags, scarves and coats\". German clothing firm Gerry Weber applied to revoke \"the trademark on account of its 'nonuse' in the periods from 2003 through 2008 and 2007 through 2012\". However, \"according to Gucci, the ruling does not affect the use of its GG logo in the region\" because “Gucci is the owner of several other valid registrations for this mark, including a Community Trade Mark (covering the European Union) for its iconic GG logo and those rights are directly enforceable in the U.K.\"\nOn 6 November 2013, Gucci won a trademark infringement and unfair competition activities lawsuit against Guess in Nanjing Intermediate People’s Court of the People's Republic of China. Gucci claimed that Guess was \" imitating its collections and image.\"\nIn December 2014, a Gucci subcontractor in Italy told Investigative Journalists that Gucci was aware it irregularly employed Chinese workers who worked as long as 14 hours a day.\n\nGucci produced controversial advertisements that many believe sexualizes and objectifies women. Erving Goffman conducted research on advertisements and how they are consistently reinforcing common stereotypes of women. He outlined different characteristics commonly found in media that tend to favor men over women. These stereotypes, which can all be found in Gucci’s advertisements, include relative size, ritualization of subordination, feminine touch, and function ranking.\n\nAlmost all of Gucci’s advertisements include a woman who is being dismembered to show off a certain part of her body, positioned in a way, that some would consider, sexualizes her body, or made much smaller in size to appear submissive to the counterpart (usually a male) in the ad. Jean Kilbourne describes how often advertisements are working to undermine women and place women in positions of passivity. Many people find these advertisements offensive and in turn many organizations have publicly criticized Gucci. The Fashion Law, a fashion legal and business website, argues that the infamous line “sex sells” is proven through Gucci’s continual use of scandalous advertisements and correlating sales.\n\nIn early 2003 Gucci produced a highly popular advertisement which pictured a supermodel with her pants pulled down and her pubic hair shaved into a “G”. The Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom) received countless complaints from people and organizations, including the director of mediawatchuk demanding the ad be banned due to his belief it was “harmful to society”. Many believed that the outcry regarding the ad just fed the idea that Gucci was using sex to successfully sell their products. Although this was a point of contention between Gucci and the Advertising Standards Authority, scholars have shown that Gucci continues to walk the thin line between offensive and acceptable advertisements.\n\nThe Italian luxury brand still continues to publish controversial ads. Gucci used a short film and images with reference to a cult film about drug addiction. This advertisement received a lot of backlash primarily because one of their young models was unhealthily thin according to the Advertising Standards Authority. This advertisement may sound shocking to some, but to the advertisement industry it is a prime example of what they are supposed to do. William O'Barr argues that advertisements' main priority is to break through and draw the consumer's attention, regardless of what is deemed appropriate in society's eyes.\n\nAldo Gucci expanded into new markets including an agreement with American Motors Corporation (AMC). The automaker merged the worlds of couture and automobiles with the Gucci AMC Hornet. Starting in October 1971, the 1972 and 1973 model year Hornet compact \"Sportabout\" station wagons became one of the first American cars to offer a special luxury trim package created by a famous fashion designer. Although coming from Italy where sleek sports cars are more revered, Gucci put his special touch efforts on the Hornet station wagon with a rear lift gate and of cargo space inside. In contrast to ordinary boxy-looking station wagons, the Sportabout's design featured a low sloping roofline in the rear and tight overall dimensions. The Gucci versions came with the designer's signature red and green trim colors on well-padded beige-upholstered seating and on the interior door panels. The Gucci crest appeared on the inside front door panels and on the front fenders, while the \"GG\" trademark was on the headliner. Exterior color selections were limited to Snow White, Hunter Green, Grasshopper Green, and Yuca Tan.\n\nThe $142 Gucci trim option package was selected on a total of 2,584 Sportabouts produced during 1972 and on 2,251 more during the 1973 model year. Additionally, a Sportabout was commissioned by Gucci for his personal use and to showcase some of his other automotive ideas. The exterior grille featured a Gucci motif, transparent covers over the front lights wrapped around the sides, and the rear trim panel had horizontal red and green stripes on a gray cloth insert. The interior was finished in black leather and a tight-weave Italian fabric incorporating the double-G pattern in black against a light gray background and gray carpeting with black piping. Front bucket seats featured center armrest with vanity case and the dashboard had pullout writing desk with folding lamp, notepad, pen and vanity mirror on a flexible holder. Rear seat passengers had a center fold-down armrest with a set of games in a removable box and the right seat back included a foldout table for snacking or playing with the game set and the left seatback opened to a compartment housing four tumblers and two beverage bottles.\n\nStarting in 1978 and producing a decreasing number each year through the 1984 model year, a Miami-based coachbuilder marketed a Gucci edition of the Cadillac Seville sedan. The exterior included a \"facing double G\" Gucci logo, an emblem actually featuring Guccio Gucci’s initials, as a hood ornament and the c-pillar covered vinyl roof. The interior had a headliner of the logo and headrests adorned with the logo as well. The dashboard carried the \"Gucci script\" logo in bold lettering. Inside the trunk was a full set of Gucci luggage.\n\nFor 2011, Gucci and Fiat unveiled special versions of the Fiat 500 featuring characteristic stripes inside on the seat belts, seat upholstery, shifter, floor mats, and key fob. The exterior includes green and red stripes below the window line and wrapping around the back as well as 16-inch wheels with Gucci’s interlocking-G logo on the center caps. Available in white with matte-finish chrome trim or in black with glossy chrome accents, the small car includes leather trim and other designs \"to make it feel like a Gucci handbag.\" The hatchbacks were joined by the 500C by Gucci featuring a sliding cloth roof with a green-red-green Gucci stripe. The Gucci versions of both the regular 500 and the cloth-top 500C were again available in 2013.\n\nGucci has had a partnership with UNICEF since 2005. Gucci stores worldwide donate a percentage of the sales for special collections made specifically for UNICEF to go toward the United Nations Children's Fund. The annual Gucci Campaign to Benefit UNICEF supports education, healthcare, protection and clean water programs for orphans and children affected by HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. For the campaign in 2009, Michael Roberts promoted a children's book, \"Snowman in Africa\" with proceeds going to UNICEF. In five years, Gucci donated over $7 million to UNICEF. Gucci is the largest corporate donor to UNICEF's \"Schools for Africa\" that was established in 2004 by UNICEF, the Nelson Mandela Foundation, and the Hamburg Society. Its goal is to increase access to basic schooling for all, with a special emphasis on children orphaned by HIV/AIDS and children living in extreme poverty.\n\nLaunched in February 2013, the \"Chime for Change\" campaign works to further the global campaign for girls' and women's empowerment. Gucci has funded over 210 projects in 81 countries through this initiative.\n\nIn 2013, it was announced that Beyoncé Knowles would work with Salma Hayek and Frida Giannini on the campaign that aims to spread female empowerment. The campaign, which aired on February 28, was set to new music by Knowles. A concert for the cause took place on June 1, 2013 in London and included other acts like Ellie Goulding, Laura Pausini, Florence and the Machine, Iggy Azalea and Rita Ora. The concert raised over $130,000.\n\nIn July 2013, activist Lydia Emily was commissioned to paint a mural on Skid Row, Los Angeles of a woman named Jessica, who is a survivor of human trafficking. She currently works for the Mary Magdalene Project—an organization which has been helping women leave the sex industry since 1980.\n\nGucci opened a museum charting its 90-year history; Gucci Museo is located in Florence, within the Palazzo della Mercanzia and overlooking the Piazza della Signoria.\n\n\n"}

It is an academic school in the University of Surrey with accreditation from Drama UK for its professional training degrees. As of 2014, it is the top scoring Drama UK accredited school for student satisfaction.\n\nGuildford School of Acting (GSA), originally known as the Grant-Bellairs School of Dance and Drama, was founded in London in 1935 by Pauline Grant and Bice Bellairs. The school moved to Guildford in 1945 as a result of World War II. In 1964, the school became a charitable organisation and was renamed Guildford School of Acting & Dance. In the early 1990s the '& Dance' was dropped. Today the school is part of the University of Surrey's Stag Hill Campus, Guildford, Surrey.\n\nThe school offers professional training and academic degrees in theatre and performance, dance, acting, musical theatre and production skills such as stage management, lighting and sound design. Surrey has a long association with dance having been the first university in the UK to validate a single honours dance degree. The university also hosts the National Resource Centre for Dance established in 1982\n. All full-time courses lead towards further and higher education qualifications validated by either the University of Surrey or Trinity College London. A leading performing arts school, GSA is recognised as a centre of excellence for Musical Theatre training alongside research specialisms in performance philosophy and contemporary theatre practice. The Centre for Performance Philosophy (CCP), led by Dr. Laura Cull Ó Maoilearca, was founded in 2016 as part of the school's Institute of Performance.\n\nUntil November 2009, the School occupied several sites in central Guildford, with facilities including drama, dance and music studios, technical workshops, IT facilities, a specialist library and resource centre, a wardrobe department, rehearsal rooms and two in-house theatres. As part of its merger with the University of Surrey, the school has moved to a completely new building which houses all faculties of the school on one site on the university campus. Peter Barlow, GSA Director (until December 2010), was handed the keys by project manager David Austin (VolkerFitzpatrick) on 13 November 2009, marking a new era for GSA, with the first classes at the new building started on 16 November. The relocation was completed in late 2011 with the opening of the Ivy Performing Arts Centre.\n\nThe school stages regular private and public performances at both The Ivy Arts Centre and other venues in Guildford and in the UK.\n\nIn 2015 the school added a course in Actor-Musicianship which will produce its first graduates in 2018.\n\nFollowing a re-structure in 2016, GSA now includes the well-established programmes in Theatre & Performance, and Dance which had previously been part of the university's School of Arts. This will produce its first graduates in 2019.\n\n"}
{"id": "9556155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9556155", "title": "Hack (comedy)", "text": "Hack (comedy)\n\nHack is a term used primarily in stand-up comedy, but also sketch comedy, improv comedy, and comedy writing to refer to a joke or premise for a joke that is considered obvious, has been frequently used by comedians in the past, and/or is blatantly copied from its original author. Alternatively, it may refer to a comedian or performance group that uses hack material or similarly unoriginal devices in their act. Since comedians and people who work with comedians are typically exposed to many more jokes than the general public, they may recognize a topic, joke or performer as hack before the general public does; as a result, even performers who do well on stage may be considered hacks by their peers.\n\nThe word \"hack\" is derived from the British term \"hackneyed\" meaning, \"over used and thus cheapened, or trite\".\n\nOccasionally a performer will be one of the first to develop a joke about a specific topic, and later on others will follow suit to excess. This renders the topic \"hack\" to new performers, but is not considered a detriment to the originator of the material.\n\nReusing humor can also be joke thievery if it is taken without permission from another specific comedian.\n\nFrom the Catskill and Vaudeville beginnings of stand-up comedy, hacking was common as there were few chances that a performer from one area would meet one from another and a single twenty-minute set could sustain a comic for a decade.\n\nIn the late fifties and early sixties, Will Jordan perfected a caricature performance of Ed Sullivan (incorporating mispronouncing the word \"show\" as \"shoe\") that became the basis for all other impersonators that followed. Soon after, Jackie Mason, Rich Little and others began adapting Jordan's caricature to their own acts. This resulted in many of Jordan's shows being canceled due to other performers doing his bit two weeks previous to his shows at the same venue. John Byner, in turn, developed his own, oft-imitated, version of Jordan's caricature that George Carlin cited as being set up with the words, \"Now you know!\"\n\nIn the sixties, comedy took a turn for the more personal. Comics like Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor, and George Carlin were no longer regurgitating joke after joke, but instead were offering insight to their own lives from a comedic point of view. As a result, jokes and persona were largely unique to the performer. Hacking proved more difficult, but also more offensive to the writer.\n\nIn the seventies joke theft became more prominent with the boom in popularity of comedy. The eighties and nineties saw the popularity of stand-up comedy continue to increase. With the advent of pay-cable networks, comics were afforded the opportunity to perform their routines unfettered. With this came a new type of joke theft wherein the first comic to tell a stolen joke on some sort of media became the one associated with the joke.\n\nFor many years, Denis Leary had been friends with fellow comedian Bill Hicks. However, when Hicks heard Leary's 1992 album \"No Cure For Cancer\", he felt Leary had stolen his act and material. The friendship ended abruptly as a result.\n\nAt least three stand-up comedians have gone on the record stating they believe Leary stole not just some of Hicks' material but his persona and attitude. As a result of this, it is claimed that after Hicks' death from pancreatic cancer, an industry joke began to circulate about Leary's transformation and subsequent success (roughly; \"Question: Why is Denis Leary a star while Bill Hicks is unknown? Answer: Because there's no cure for cancer\").\n\nAlso in the nineties, began a nearly universal hack of an impression of Bill Cosby, the style of which was first unveiled by Eddie Murphy in his concert \"Raw\".\n\nMore recent times have seen public rivalries between comics over the subject of hacking. Louis CK has maintained a relatively quiet rivalry with Dane Cook over three bits on Cook's album, \"Retaliation\" that allegedly bear some resemblance to three bits on CK's album \"Live in Houston\". This claim is further complicated by both artists having performed bits on naming kids that strongly resemble \"My Real Name\", a bit from Steve Martin's album, \"A Wild and Crazy Guy\".\n\nJoe Rogan, by contrast has been very open in accusing Carlos Mencia of hacking.\n\nIn 2010, Italian comic and satirist Daniele Luttazzi was accused of having plagiarised many jokes from comedians such as George Carlin, Mitch Hedberg, Eddie Izzard, Chris Rock, Bill Hicks and Robert Schimmel. But five years before those charges, Luttazzi himself told about his scheme on his personal blog: he wrote that he adds references to famous comedians' jokes to his work as a defense against the million-euro lawsuits he has to face because of his satire. (In March 2012, Luttazzi won a legal battle against La7 broadcasting company, which in 2007 abruptly closed his late show \"Decameron\", accusing him, among other charges, of plagiarism from Bill Hicks. Sentence: It was original satire, not plagiarism. La7 shall pay Luttazzi 1 million 2 hundred thousand euros.) Luttazzi calls his ruse \"the Lenny Bruce trick\" after a similar trick played by his hero, Lenny Bruce. Luttazzi asked his readers to find out the original jokes. He awards a prize to anyone who finds a \"nugget\", i.e. a reference to famous jokes: he calls the game \"treasure hunt\". Luttazzi also calls the charges \"naive\", explaining why those jokes are not \"plagiarized\", but \"calqued\", which is a fair use of original material. He uses a joke by Emo Philips to prove that the meaning of a joke depends on its context. Luttazzi's blog lists all the comedians and writers quoted in his works.\n\nIn 2011, one of the contestants on the talent quest television program \"Australia's Got Talent\" was Jordan Paris, whose act was stand-up comedy. His act went well, the judges were impressed, and he made it through to the semi-finals. However, it was later revealed that he had plagiarised his jokes from comedians Lee Mack and Geoff Keith. The television network eventually decided to give him a chance to redeem himself and he was allowed to compete in the semi-final, provided he use his own material. Paris' effort this time was self-deprecating, joking about his plagiarism and his large teeth. The first joke went well, but the rest went downhill. It was later found out that the joke that went well - \"I just sacked my two writers - Copy and Paste\" - had been done in 2009 by comedian Jeffrey Ross, about Brad Garrett, at a roast of Joan Rivers. Ross had said, \"This guy has two writers, their names are Cut and Paste.\"\n\nIn January 2012, Blogger and comedian Troy Holm was ridiculed on the social networking site Facebook for stealing jokes and stories from comedian Doug Stanhope and posting them to his Blog from 2010, claiming them as his own work, including Stanhope's \"Fuck someone uglier than you\" routine, which was found on Stanhope's Acid Bootleg. Troy Holm also plagiarized Stanhope's story of an encounter with a transsexual prostitute nearly verbatim, substituting himself as Stanhope, and changing a few small details, causing a backlash from Stanhope's fans. This catapulted Troy Holm into an internet icon which started the \"Occupy Troy Holm\" Movement. Stanhope commented on the Occupy Troy Holm Facebook page that \"To the few people who seem to think this is overboard...and it is...I don't think that you know the levels to which this guy has been ripping me off. He didn't take a tit-fuck joke and use it as a status update. He's been living my entire life as though it was his, changing some names and then promoting with twitters... Look at his site and most the entirety of it is me, including the comments where he uses my stuff to pass as his own conversation. And on Twitter. So who is he ripping off for that stuff that \"isn't\" mine?\"\n\nHacking is not limited to stand-up comedy. Often entire premises in film and television shows are taken from comics or even other media.\n\nDick Cavett and Woody Allen often cited to each other the many instances of their jokes appearing in television shows without their permission, sometimes even falsely attributed to each other.\n\nAllen's jokes and topics were regularly stolen by the highly successful television show, \"Laugh In\". This proved extremely painful to Allen.\n\nSeveral episodes of \"The Simpsons\", including \"\", \"Treehouse of Horror XIII\", and \"The Italian Bob\" have poked fun at \"Family Guy\", implying that MacFarlane's show is guilty of stealing jokes and premises from \"The Simpsons\". However, the producers of both shows have said that there is no serious feud between the two of them and their shows.\n\nThere is, historically, very little legal recourse taken in cases of hacking. Some comics, however, have chosen to exact their own justice. W. C. Fields reportedly paid fifty dollars to have a hack comic's legs broken.\n\nTypically, the repercussions of hacking are limited to personal animosity. On this issue, it sometimes appears that the offended comics are alone in their concern. For example, on February 10, 2007 at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles, Joe Rogan argued on-stage with Carlos Mencia, accusing him of hacking other comedians' work. According to Rogan's account, he had just finished his act and introduced the next performer, Ari Shaffir, as a comedian who opens for \"Carlos Men-steal-ia\". Mencia took offense and walked on the stage. The Comedy Store later cancelled Rogan's shows and suggested he \"take a break\" from the Comedy Store, which was then followed by Rogan's manager (who also manages Mencia) dropping Rogan. The entire incident was filmed as part of Rogan's internet reality show, \"JoeShow\". It was then made available to watch or download at numerous websites, including Rogan's.\n\nJoe Rogan said, \"People take plagiarism so seriously in all other forms of media, whether it's music, newspapers, books, but with comedy, it's like, 'You're on your own, fucker.'\"\n\nThe internet, however, has opened up a new medium for \"outing\" a hack. Websites like YouTube allow users to upload videos and share them with others. This has made it much easier to show evidence of joke thievery in a public forum.\n\nIn January 2012, Troy Holm, an amateur Comic, stole several jokes from Doug Stanhope and posted them to his blog under the guise of having written them, himself. Stanhope discovered the blog and tipped-off his fans who then deluged Holms blog with negative and berating comments. The blog has since been taken down.\n\nSteven Rosenthal and Steve Silberberg have published a \"Guide to Hack\" to help new comics avoid hacking, which references (and gives credit to) an earlier work on the same subject by Andy Kindler called, \"The Hacks Handbook: A Starter Kit\".\n\n"}

It was signed at The Hague, Netherlands on 14 May 1954 and entered into force on 7 August 1956. As of September 2018, it has been ratified by 133 states.\n\nThe provisions of the 1954 Convention were supplemented and clarified by two protocols concluded in 1954 and 1999. All three agreements are part of International Humanitarian Law, which, in the form of further agreements, primarily includes provisions defining the permissible means and methods of warfare and aiming at the widest possible protection of persons not involved in the fighting. In contrast to these parts of International Humanitarian Law, the agreements on the protection of cultural property were drawn up under the auspices of the United Nations (UN); the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is primarily responsible for the dissemination and monitoring of compliance. In addition to rules designed to ensure the protection and respect of cultural property during an armed conflict, these agreements also provide for security measures to be implemented in times of peace. As of June 2018, 132 states are party to the Hague Convention of 1954, 109 and 77 states respectively have acceded to the Protocols of 1954 and 1999. Blue Shield International, based in The Hague, is active in the field of international coordination with regard to military and civil structures for the protection of cultural assets.\n\nThe guiding principles of the Convention and the motivation for its conclusion, dissemination and respect are summarised in the preamble, which states, among other things,\n\n\"... that any damage to cultural property, irrespective of the people it belongs to, is a damage to the cultural heritage of all humanity, because every people contributes to the world's culture...\"\n\nAs of September 2018, 133 states are party to the treaty. Currently, there are 109 States Parties to the First Protocol. The Second Protocol has 77 States Parties.\n\nFor the purposes of the present Convention, the term 'cultural property' shall cover, irrespective of origin or ownership:\n\n(a) movable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people, such as monuments of architecture, art or history, whether religious or secular; archaeological sites; groups of buildings which, as a whole, are of historical or artistic interest; works of art; manuscripts, books and other objects of artistic, historical or archaeological interest; as well as scientific collections and important collections of books or archives or of reproductions of the property defined above;\n\n(b) buildings whose main and effective purpose is to preserve or exhibit the movable cultural property defined in sub-paragraph (a) such as museums, large libraries and depositories of archives, and refuges intended to shelter, in the event of armed conflict, the movable cultural property defined in sub-paragraph (a);\n\n(c) centers containing a large amount of cultural property as defined in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b), to be known as 'centers containing monuments'.\n\nCultural property is the manifestation and expression of the cultural heritage of a group of people or a society. It is an expression of the ways of living developed by a community and passed on from generation to generation, including the customs of a people, their practices, places, objects, artistic endeavours and values. The protection of cultural property during times of armed conflict or occupation is of great importance, because such property reflects the life, history and identity of communities; its preservation helps to rebuild communities, re-establish identities, and link people's past with their present and future.\n\nThe Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 preceded the Hague Convention of 1954. The multilateral agreement of 1899 and the slightly amended later version of 1907 contained in Article 27 the commandment for the attacking party to spare historical monuments, educational institutions and institutions of religious, not-for-profit, artistic or scientific significance as far as possible during sieges and bombardments. The party under attacked is called upon to ark appropriate buildings. Article 56 also contained a general ban on the confiscation, destruction or damage of such facilities. However, during the First World War, acceptance of these first Hague Conventions was severely restricted by the so-called all-participation clause. It stated that, in the event of war or armed conflict, this Agreement should apply only if all States involved in that conflict are parties to the Convention.\n\nThe Russian lawyer, painter and writer Nicholas Roerich, who witnessed the destruction of cultural assets in Russia during the First World War and the October Revolution, initiated the development of an independent treaty at the beginning of the 1930s to protect cultural assets during armed conflicts. Ten years later, just before the beginning of the First World War, he had also addressed his idea to the Russian Tsar Nicholas II. On his initiative, Georges Chklaver of the Institute for Higher International Studies at the University of Paris drew up a corresponding draft in 1929. This proposal was subsequently discussed by the International Museum Office of the League of Nations and at private conferences in Bruges in 1931 and 1932 and in Washington, D.C. in 1933. The seventh international conference of American states, which took place in Buenos Aires in 1933, recommended the adoption of the draft. The Board of the Pan-American Union subsequently presented a treaty \"on the protection of artistic and scientific institutions and historical monuments\", which was signed on 15 April 1935 in the White House by 21 states in North, Central and South America. Ten of the signatory states also became parties by ratification, the first of which was the United States on 13 July 1935 and the last of which was Colombia on 20 February 1937. The agreement, also known as the Roerich Pact after its initiator, entered into force on 26 August 1935.\n\nThe Roerich Pact contained eight articles and several significant innovations compared with the general provisions of Articles 27 and 56 of the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. On the one hand, the treaty established the status of neutrality for historical monuments, museums, scientific and artistic institutions as well as educational and cultural institutions. This legal position, comparable to the neutrality of medical personnel and comparable institutions during a war, resulted in respect for these goods by all parties involved in a conflict and thus their protection. The Parties should send lists of monuments and sites for which they claimed protection under the Treaty to the Pan-American Union, which should forward them to all States Parties.\n\nIn addition, the Treaty defined a protection mark for the marking of cultural objects, consisting of three red dots in a red circle on a white background. Nicholas Roerich, who designed it with early symbolism in mind, described the significance of the three points as a symbol of art, science and religion as the three most important cultural activities of humanity, with the circle as the element that linked these three aspects in the past, present and future. The symbol was also called the \"Banner of Peace\", the movement based on the Roerich Pact under the name Pax Cultura in analogy to the Geneva Conventions as the \"Red Cross of Culture\".\n\nHowever, the acceptance of the Roerich Pact was limited to the United States and the countries of Central and South America. Not a single country in Europe and Asia, the geopolitical focus of the Second World War that began a few years later, signed or ratified the treaty. Even though it remains valid in relations between the parties and the Organization of American States (OAS) and continues to act as a depositary in succession to the Pan-American Union, the Roerich Pact remained without significant practical relevance. As the USA is not party to the 1999 Second Protocol of the Hague Convention, the Roerich Pact is therefore still of importance as a contractual obligation in the area of cultural property protection. Nevertheless, with the establishment of a protective label and the administration of lists of cultural assets worthy of protection by a central international institution, this treaty introduced two important far-reaching principles in the area of the protection of cultural assets in armed conflicts that remain important today.\n\nOnly four years after the Roerich Pact was signed, the government of the Netherlands presented a draft for a new convention, in the drafting of which the International Museum Office of the League of Nations was also significantly involved. However, the start of the Second World War in the same year prevented all further steps to develop and implement this proposal. After the end of the war, in 1948 the Netherlands again submitted a proposal to UNESCO, which had been founded three years earlier. In 1951, the General Conference of UNESCO decided to set up a committee of governmental experts to draft a new convention. A year later, this committee submitted a draft to the General Conference, which forwarded it to the national governments for further discussion. From 21 April to 14 May 1954, an international conference was held in The Hague with the participation of 56 states, which drew up a final version and adopted it as the \"Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict\". The agreement entered into force on 7 August 1956. After the 1948 Genocide Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, this was the second important agreement in the field of international humanitarian law to which the United Nations played a major role in its creation and implementation.\n\nThe Hague Convention outlines various prohibitions and obligations which States Parties are expected to observe, both in peacetime and in times of conflict.\n\nBroadly, the Hague Convention requires that States Parties adopt protection measures during peacetime for the safeguarding of cultural property. Such measures include the preparation of inventories, preparation for the removal of movable cultural property and the designation of competent authorities responsible for the safeguarding of cultural property.\n\nStates Parties undertake to respect cultural property, not only located within their own territory, but also within the territory of other States Parties, during times of conflict and occupation. In doing so, they agree to refrain from using cultural property and its immediate surroundings for purposes likely to expose it to destruction or damage in the event of armed conflict. States Parties also agree to refrain from any act of hostility directed against such property.\n\nThe Convention also requires the establishment of special units within national military forces, to be charged with responsibility for the protection of cultural property. Furthermore, States Parties are required to implement criminal sanctions for breaches of the Convention, and to undertake promotion of the Convention to the general public, cultural heritage professionals, the military and law-enforcement agencies.\n\nAn example of the successful implementation of the Hague Convention was the Gulf War, in which many members of the coalition forces (who were either party to the Convention or who, in the instance of the US, were not party to the Convention) accepted the Convention's rules, most notably by creating a \"no-fire target list\" of places where cultural property was known to exist.\n\nThe obligation of States Parties to safeguard cultural property in peacetime is outlined in Article 3. It stipulates:\n\n'The High Contracting Parties undertake to prepare in time of peace for the safeguarding of cultural property situated within their own territory against the foreseeable effects of an armed conflict, by taking such measures, as they consider appropriate.'\n\nThe Hague Convention sets out a minimum level of respect which all States Parties must observe, both in relation to their own national heritage as well as the heritage of other States Parties. States are obliged not to attack cultural property, nor to remove or misappropriate movable property from its territory of origin. Only exceptional cases of 'military necessity' will excuse derogation from this obligation. However, a State Party is not entitled to ignore the Convention's rules by reason of another Party's failure to implement safeguarding measures alone.\n\nThis is set out in Article 4 of the Hague Convention:\n\n'Article 4:\n\n(1) The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect cultural property situated within their own territory as well as within the territory of other High Contracting Parties by refraining from any use of the property and its immediate surroundings or of the appliances in use for its protection for purposes which are likely to expose it to destruction or damage in the event of armed conflict; and by refraining from any act of hostility directed against such property.\n\n(2) The obligations mentioned in paragraph I of the present Article may be waived only in cases where military necessity imperatively requires such a waiver.\n\n(3) The High Contracting Parties further undertake to prohibit, prevent and, if necessary, put a stop to any form of theft, pillage or misappropriation of, and any acts of vandalism directed against, cultural property. They shall, refrain from requisitioning movable cultural property situated in the territory of another High Contracting Party.\n\n(4) They shall refrain from any act directed by way of reprisals against cultural property.\n\n(5) No High Contracting Party may evade the obligations incumbent upon it under the present Article, in respect of another High Contracting Party, by reason of the fact that the latter has not applied the measures of safeguard referred to in Article 3.'\n\nThe rules set out in the Hague Convention also apply to States who are Occupying Powers of territory during conflict or otherwise. The Convention obliges Occupying Powers to respect the cultural property of the occupied territory, and to support local national authorities in its preservation and repair when necessary. This obligation is articulated in Article 5:\n\n'Article 5:\n\n(1) Any High Contracting Party in occupation of the whole or part of the territory of another High Contracting Party shall as far as possible support the competent national authorities of the occupied country in safeguarding and preserving its cultural property.\n\n(2) Should it prove necessary to take measures to preserve cultural property situated in occupied territory and damaged by military operations, and should the competent national authorities be unable to take such measures, the Occupying Power shall, as far as possible, and in close co-operation with such authorities, take the most necessary measures of preservation.\n\n(3) Any High Contracting Party whose government is considered their legitimate government by members of a resistance movement, shall, if possible, draw their attention to the obligation to comply with those provisions of the Conventions dealing with respect for cultural property.'\n\nThe Hague Convention establishes a 'special protection' regime, which obliges States Parties to ensure the immunity of cultural property under special protection from acts of hostility (Articles 8 and 9). Under Article 8, this protection may be granted to one of three categories of cultural property: (1) refuges intended to shelter movable cultural property in the event of armed conflict; (2) centers containing monuments; and (3) other immovable cultural property of very great importance. To receive special protection, cultural property must also be located an adequate distance from an industrial center or location which would render it vulnerable to attack, and must not be used for military purposes.\n\nThe First Protocol was adopted at the same time as the Hague Convention, on 14 May 1954. It specifically applies to movable cultural property only, and prohibits the export of movable property from occupied territory and also requires its return to its original territory at the conclusion of hostilities (Article 1). States Parties under the obligation to prevent the export of such property may be required to pay an indemnity to States whose property was removed during hostilities.\n\nCriminal acts committed against cultural property in the late 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s highlighted the deficiencies in the implementation of the Hague Convention and its First Protocol. As a result of the 'Boylan review' (a review of the Convention led by Professor Patrick Boylan), the Second Protocol to the Hague Convention was adopted at a Diplomatic Conference held at The Hague in March 1999. The Second Protocol seeks complement and expand upon the provisions of the Hague Convention, by including developments in international humanitarian law and cultural property protection which had emerged since 1954. It builds on the provisions contained in the Convention relating to the safeguarding of and respect for cultural property, as well as the conduct of hostilities; thereby providing greater protection for cultural property than that conferred by the Hague Convention and its First Protocol.\n\nOne of the most important features of the Second Protocol is the 'enhanced protection' regime it establishes. This new category of cultural property is outlined in Chapter Three of the Second Protocol. Enhanced protection status means that the relevant cultural property must remain immune from military attack, once it is inscribed on the List of Cultural Property Under Enhanced Protection. While the 1954 Hague Convention requires States not to make any cultural property the object of attack except for cases of 'military necessity', the Second Protocol stipulates that cultural property under enhanced protection must not be made a military target, even if it has (by its use) become a 'military objective'. An attack against cultural property which enjoys enhanced protection status is only excusable if such an attack is the 'only feasible means of terminating the use of property [in that way]' (Article 13).\n\nTo be granted enhanced protection, the cultural property in question must satisfy the three criteria stipulated in Article 10 of the Second Protocol. The three conditions are:\n\n(a) it is cultural heritage of the greatest importance for humanity;\n\n(b) it is protected by adequate domestic legal and administrative measures recognising its exceptional cultural and historic value and ensuring the highest level of protection; and\n\n(c) it is not used for military purposes or to shield military sites and a declaration has been made by the Party which has control over the cultural property, confirming that it will not be so used.\n\nCurrently there are 13 cultural properties from 8 States Parties inscribed on the Enhanced Protection List. These include sites in Azerbaijan, Belgium, Cambodia, Cyprus, Georgia, Italy, Lithuania, and Mali.\n\nArticle 24 of the Second Protocol establishes a 12-member Committee for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. Its members are elected for a term of four years, and an equitable geographic representation is taken into account at the election of its members. The Committee meets once a year in ordinary session, and in extraordinary sessions if and when it deems necessary.\n\nThe Committee is responsible for the granting, suspension and cancellation of enhanced protection to cultural properties nominated by States Parties. It also receives and considers requests for international assistance which are submitted by States, as well as determining the use of the Fund for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. Under Article 27 of the Second Protocol, the Committee also has a mandate to develop Guidelines for the implementation of the Second Protocol.\n\nArticle 29 of the Second Protocol establishes the Fund for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. Its purpose is to provide financial or other assistance for 'preparatory or other measures to be taken in peacetime'. It also provides financial or other assistance in relation to 'emergency, provisional or other measures to protect cultural property during periods of armed conflict', or for recovery at the end of hostilities. The Fund consists of voluntary contributions from States Parties to the Second Protocol. In 2016, the sums of US $50,000 and US $40,000 were provided to Libya and Mali respectively from the Fund, in response to their requests for assistance in the installation of emergency and safeguarding measures.\n\nChapter Four of the Second Protocol specifies sanctions to be imposed for serious violations against cultural property, and defines the conditions in which individual criminal responsibility should apply. This reflects an increased effort to fight impunity through effective criminal prosecution since the adoption of the Hague Convention in 1954. The Second Protocol defines five 'serious violations' for which it establishes individual criminal responsibility (Article 15):\nStates are obligated to adopt appropriate legislation to make these violations criminal offences under their domestic legislation, to stipulate appropriate penalties for these offences, and to establish jurisdiction over these offences (including universal jurisdiction for three of the five serious violations, as set out in Article 16(1)(c)).\n\nAn example of prosecution for crimes against cultural property is \"The Prosecutor v Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi\" case, handed down by the International Criminal Court on 27 September 2016. Al Mahdi was charged with and pleaded guilty to the war crime of intentionally directing attacks against historic monuments and buildings dedicated to religion, and sentenced to nine years' imprisonment. Al Mahdi was a member of the Ansar Eddine group (a group associated with Al Qaeda), and a co-perpetrator of damaging and destroying nine mausoleums and one mosque in Timbuktu, Mali, in 2012.\n\nIn 2016 UNESCO, in collaboration with the Sanremo International Institute of Humanitarian Law, published a manual titled 'Protection of Cultural Property: Military Manual'. This manual outlines the rules and obligations contained in the Second Protocol, and provides practical guidance on how these rules should be implemented by military forces around the world. It also contains suggestions as to best military practices in relation to these obligations. It relates only to the international laws governing armed conflict, and does not discuss military assistance that is provided in connection with other circumstances such as natural disasters.\n\nThe Nazi Party headed by Adolf Hitler rose to power in Germany in 1933 after the country's crippling defeat, and its socioeconomic distress during the years following World War I. World War II was aimed at reclaiming the glory of the once great Germanic state. Cultural property of many European nations and significant ethnic and social groups within them fell victim to Nazi Germany. The Nazi party, through the Third Reich, confiscated close to 20% of all Western European art during the war. By the end of the Second World War, the Nazi party had looted and collected thousands of objects, art works and artefacts from occupied nations, destroyed many, or stored them in secret.\n\nWith artists depicting the hardship of the German people after World War I, and further expressing the fear of anti-Semitism and fascism, the Nazi party and Hitler himself soon realised the dangerous power of art, and began to clamp down on artistic production and forcing both artists and the public alike to adhere to a Nazi-approved style.\n\nInherent within the Nazi's ideology was the idea of supremacy of the Aryan Race and all that it produced; as such the Nazi campaign's aims were to neutralize non-Germanic cultures and this was done through the destruction of culturally significant art and artefacts. This is illustrated greatest in the Jewish communities throughout Europe; by devising a series of laws that allowed them to justify and regulate the legal confiscation of cultural and personal property. Within Germany the looting of German Jewish cultural property began with the confiscation of non-Germanic artwork in the German state collection. Further, artists that were Jewish and artworks that did not match the Nazi ideology, or posed a threat to it, were stamped as degenerate art. Degenerate works of art, culminating in the infamous exhibition with the same name, were those whose subject, artist, or art was either Jewish or expressed Anti-Nazi sentiments, and was as such offensive to the Third Reich.\n\nJewish collections were looted the most throughout the war. German Jews were ordered to report their personal assets, which were then privatized by the country. Jewish owned art galleries were forced to sell the works of art they housed. The Nazis concentrated their efforts on ensuring that all art within Germany would be Aryan in nature, speaking to the might of the Germanic state rather than Jewish art which was deemed as a blight on society. In a feat to \"purge\" German museums and collections, confiscation committees seized approximately 16,000 items within Germany. The remaining unexploited art was destroyed in massive bonfires. As the war progressed, the Nazi party elite ordered the confiscation of cultural property throughout various European countries.\n\nIn the Soviet Union, Nazi plunder of cultural significant art is best illustrated in the Third Reich's pillage of the Catherine Palace near St Petersburg and its famous Amber Room dating to the early 1700s. In October 1941, the Nazis had occupied the western portion of the Soviet Union, and began removing art treasures to the west. The entirety of the Amber Room was removed to Königsberg and reconstructed there. In January 1945, with the Russian army advancing on the city, the Amber Room was ordered to be moved again but its fate is thereafter unclear. A post-war Russian report concluded that 'summarizing all the facts, we can say that the Amber Room was destroyed between 9 and 11 April 1945' during the battle to take the city. However, in the absence of definitive proof, other theories about its fate continue to be entertained to the present day. With financial assistance from German donors, Russian craftsmen reconstructed a new Amber Room during the 1990s. The new room was dedicated by Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder at the 300th anniversary of the city of Saint Petersburg.\n\nWith the conclusion of the Second World War and the subsequent defeat of the Axis Powers, the atrocities which the Nazi leadership condoned, leading to the removal of culturally significant items and the destruction of numerous others could not be allowed to occur in future generations. This led the victorious Allied forces to create provisions to ensure safeguards for culturally significant items in times of war. As a result, following the signature of the Roerich Pact by the American States in 1935, attempts were undertaken to draft a more comprehensive convention for the protection of monuments and works of art in time of war. In 1939, a draft convention, elaborated under the auspices of the International Museums Office, was presented to governments by the Netherlands. Due to the onset of the Second World War the draft convention was shelved with no further steps being taken. With the conclusion of the war, a new proposal was submitted to UNESCO by the Netherlands in 1948. The General Conference of UNESCO in 1951 decided to convene a committee of government experts to draft a convention. This committee met in 1952 and thereafter submitted its drafts to the General Conference. The intergovernmental Conference, which drew up and adopted the Convention and the further Acts, took place at The Hague from 21 April to 14 May 1954 where 56 States were represented. Following this international agreement The Hague Convention For the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict would come into force in 1956 in order to be an instrument of non derogation for the states bound by the document to stop the looting and destruction of cultural property.\n\nThe Rome Statute, adopted in July 1998 and entering into force four years later, as the legal basis of the International Criminal Court (ICC), defines in Article 8(2) deliberate attacks against buildings of a religious, educational, artistic, scientific or non-profit nature and against historical monuments as war crimes in both international and non-international armed conflicts. The International Criminal Court is thus authorised to prosecute such crimes if such an act was committed either by a national of a Contracting Party or on the territory of a Contracting Party. However, it only exercises its competence if the country concerned is unwilling or unable to ensure effective prosecution itself. Since September 2015, Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi has been charged with the destruction of mausoleums in Timbuktu in the first trial before the ICC over the destruction of cultural assets.\n\nArticle 3 of the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia also contains provisions that allow the prosecution of violations of the fundamental principles of the Hague Convention of 1954. On the basis of this article, for the first time since the conclusion of the Convention, proceedings were brought in an international court for the destruction of cultural property during an armed conflict.\n\nFrom the time of its establishment the city of Dubrovnik was under the protection of the Byzantine Empire; after the Fourth Crusade the city came under the sovereignty of Venice 1205–1358 CE, and by the Treaty of Zadar in 1358, it became part of the Hungarian-Croatian Kingdom. Following the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the city was annexed by Austria and remained part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the conclusion of the First World War. From 1918 to 1939 Dubrovnik was part of the Zetska Banovina District that established its Croatian connections. From 1945 to 1990 Croatia would become part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. One of the most striking features of the historic city of Dubrovnik, and that which gives its characteristic appearance are its intact medieval fortifications. Its historic city walls run uninterrupted encircling the Old-City. This complex structure of fortification is one of the most complete depictions of medieval construction in the Mediterranean, consisting of a series of forts, bastions, casemates, towers and detached forts. Within the Old City are many medieval churches, cathedrals, and palaces from the Baroque period, encircled by its fortified wall, which would ensure its listed place by UNESCO as a world heritage site in 1972. The Old Town is not only an architectural and urban ensemble of high quality, but it is also full of museums and libraries, such as the collection of the Ragusan masters in the Dominican Monastery, the Museum of the History of Dubrovnik, the Icon Museum, and the libraries of the Franciscan and Dominican Monasteries. It also houses the archives of Ragusa, which have been kept continuously since the 13th century and are a very important source for Mediterranean history. The archives hold materials created by the civil service in the Republic of Ragusa.\n\nThe Siege of Dubrovnik was a military engagement fought between the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) and Croatian forces which defended the city of Dubrovnik and its surroundings during the Croatian War of Independence. The Old Town was specifically targeted by the JNA even though it served no military purpose to bomb this town. At the heart of the bombing efforts by the JNA elite was the complete eradication of the memory of the Croatian people and history by erasing their cultural heritage and destroying their cultural property. The court's convictions, which among other charges were also based on this article, were issued in February 2001 against Dario Kordić, a commander of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) during the war in Bosnia, against Miodrag Jokić, a senior commander in the navy of the Yugoslav People's Army during the Battle of Dubrovnik in 1991, and against Milan Martić, a politician and military leader of the internationally unrecognized Republic of Serbian Krajina. The attacks on the Herzegovinian city of Mostar, which in November 1993 led to the destruction of the Stari most bridge, internationally recognised as an outstanding cultural asset, led to the trial of six defendants before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in April 2006. Among them is the Croatian General Slobodan Praljak, who is suspected of having ordered the fire on the bridge.\n\nThe historic town of Mostar, spanning a deep valley of the Neretva River, developed in the 15th and 16th centuries as an Ottoman frontier town and during the Austro-Hungarian period in the 19th and 20th centuries. Mostar was mostly known for its old Turkish houses and specifically the Old Bridge; the Stari Mostar, after which it is named. In the 1990s conflict with the former Yugoslavia, however, most of the historic town and the Old Bridge were destroyed purposely by Croatian Army and their allies. This type of destruction was in step with that of the Old Town of Dubrovnik, where the aim was the eradication of the memory of the people that once occupied the land, an effort reminiscent of the Third Reich and the Nazi party. The attacks on the Herzegovinian city of Mostar, which in November 1993 led to the destruction of the Stari most bridge, internationally recognised as an outstanding cultural asset, led to the trial of six defendants before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in April 2006. Among them is the Croatian General Slobodan Praljak, who is suspected of having ordered the firing of the bridge.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge Tribunal, established by the United Nations together with the government of Cambodia in July 2006, has the possibility of prosecuting the destruction of cultural assets during the Khmer Rouge dictatorship from April 1975 to January 1979, with explicit reference to the Hague Convention of 1954, pursuant to Article 7 of the Law on the Establishment of Extraordinary Chambers. During this time, most of the more than 3,300 temples and 130 mosques in Cambodia were severely damaged by the Khmer Rouge. They also destroyed all 73 Catholic churches and many other sites of religious or cultural significance. The Hague Convention of 1954 can be applied in principle, since Cambodia became a party to the Convention in 1962, before the Khmer Rouge came to power, and because Article 19 of the Convention stipulates that even in non-international armed conflicts, each party to the conflict is bound at least by the provisions on respect for cultural property.\n\nHowever, it is not yet known whether and to what extent trials will be instituted in the court which are based on the destruction of cultural property. A possible problem with the application of Article 7 and thus with the Hague Convention, is that it is a legal requirement to establish the existence of an armed conflict. This would then resemble the definition commonly used in international humanitarian law. Whether such an assessment of the Khmer Rouge dictatorship will be possible, cannot yet be predicted.\n\nDeliberate destruction and theft of cultural heritage has been conducted by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant since 2014 in Iraq, Syria, and to a lesser extent in Libya. The destruction targets various places of worship under ISIL control and ancient historical artifacts. In Iraq, between the fall of Mosul in June 2014 and February 2015, ISIL has plundered and destroyed at least 28 historical religious buildings. The valuable items from some buildings were looted in order to smuggle and sell them to finance ISIL activities.\n\nAlthough Libya, Syria and Iraq ratified the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict in 1957, 1958 and 1967 respectively, it has not been effectively enforced.\n\nAs of June 2018, 131 states have become party to the Hague Convention of 1954 and 109 states to the first protocol. 77 states have become party to the Second Protocol of 1999.\n\nOf the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, France became a party in 1957. Russia is contracting party in legal succession of the Soviet Union, which also became party in 1957. the People's Republic of China ratified the convention in 2000 and the United States acceded in 2009. The United Kingdom signed the Agreement in 1954 and ratified the Convention and acceded to the Protocols in 2017.\n\nThe main reason for the long period between signature and ratification by the United States were the reservations of the US Department of Defense during the Cold War, that the Convention's obligations regarding the possible use of nuclear weapons could not be fulfilled. The Joint Chiefs of Staff, to which the commanders-in-chief of all units of the American armed forces belong, unanimously declared itself in 1995 in favour of voluntary compliance with the Convention. On 6 January 1999, then US President Bill Clinton recommended that the US Senate ratify both agreements. In his opinion, they were not only in accordance with the principles and methods of the American Armed Forces, but were even based on them in essential aspects. After the Senate approved accession in September 2008, the US Ambassador to UNESCO, Stephen Engelken, handed over the instrument of ratification to Kōichirō Matsuura, Secretary-General of UNESCO on 13 March 2009. On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Convention on 14 May 2004, the Government of the United Kingdom declared its intention to become a party to the Convention and the two Protocols. This was due to the conclusion of the Second Protocol of 1999, which, in the view of the British government, eliminated essential weaknesses and ambiguities of the 1954 Convention. A draft law containing ratification of the Convention, the two protocols and criminal law provisions was announced by the UK government in November 2006.\n\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), a legally independent specialized agency of the United Nations based in Paris, and is the most important international institution in the field of dissemination and implementation of the protection of cultural property in armed conflicts. It acts as depositary of the Hague Convention of 1954 and its two Protocols and administers the \"International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection\".\n\nIn addition, Blue Shield International (formerly the International Committee of the Blue Shield, ICBS; in French Comité International du Bouclier Bleu, CIBB) has existed since 1996. Its mission is to improve international cooperation in the field of cultural heritage protection and to support local and regional activities. The Second Protocol of 1999 explicitly mentions in Articles 11 and 27 the consultative role of the International Committee of the Blue Shield in the implementation of the Agreement. Since the International Committee was founded in 2017, national Blue Shield Committees have already been established in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Benin, Brazil, Chile, Curacao, Denmark, France, Georgia, Guatemala, Haiti, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Madagascar, Macedonia, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Senegal, Spain, the Czech Republic, Ukraine and the USA, comparable to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. These national associations support the work of the International Committee in their respective home countries. The Association of the National Committees of the Blue Shield (ANCBS) was established on September 28, 2006 as its umbrella organization. Since 2017, all international activities have been bundled in Blue Shield International.\n\nWhile in many wars the freedom of movement of United Nations personnel is significantly restricted due to security concerns, Blue Shield is regarded as particularly suitable due to its structure to act flexibly and autonomously in armed conflicts. Despite the partial dissolution of state structures and the very unclear security situation resulting from the wars and unrest in Iraq, Syria, Mali, Egypt and Libya, the employees of Blue Shield and its national organizations then carried out very robust undertakings to protect the cultural assets there. This concerns in particular the collection of cultural assets to be protected, the compilation with local experts of \"no-strike lists\" (- which preserve the coordinates of important cultural monuments), the linking of civil and military structures and the training of local military personnel with regard to the protection of cultural assets. From Blue Shield's point of view, it is not enough to develop and adopt international law norms such as the Second Protocol to the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict or the Doha Statement of the Conference of 'Ulamâ on Islam and Cultural Heritage'. It is necessary to implement these standards effectively on a global scale. This also concerns the prevention of the illicit trade in antiquities and stolen cultural assets to finance military conflicts. As a result of the destruction of cultural assets by armed conflict, war and unrest in Iraq, Syria, Mali or Afghanistan, but also by earthquakes such as in Haiti or Nepal, cooperation has developed between Blue-Shield and national armed forces such as the US Army or the British Army.\n\nThe \"International League of National Societies for the Protection of Cultural Property\", based in the Swiss city of Freiburg, was also established in May 1997 as an international umbrella organisation. Through the activities of these national and international organisations and associations, which also include the protection of cultural property against disasters in times of peace, civil society structures will play an increasing role in the field of cultural property protection and support the work of state and international institutions.\n\nOne example of international cooperation in the protection of cultural assets was the temporary storage of art treasures from the National Museum in Kabul, Afghanistan, in Switzerland. The art objects, which were severely threatened in the National Museum both by the Afghan Civil War (1996–2001) that lasted until 1995 and by the subsequent rule of the Taliban regime, were moved to a so-called \"Afghanistan Museum in Exile\" in the Swiss town of Bubendorf in 1999 with the consent of all parties to the conflict. The exhibition, which was supported primarily by the voluntary work of Swiss citizens and exiled Afghans, as well as by donations of around 1.5 million Swiss francs and supervised by the Swiss Afghanistan Institute based in Bubendorf, was open to the public from October 2000 to October 2006 and was visited by around 50,000 people during this time. In March 2007, the objects were returned to Kabul under the direction of UNESCO and with the support of the German Air Force. According to the spokesman of the Bubendorf Museum, this was the largest return of art objects since the end of the Second World War.\n\nIn contrast, the Iraqi National Museum in Baghdad was seriously plundered from 8 to 12 April 2003, some three weeks after the start of the Iraq War. The museum was reopened only three years earlier on 28 April 2000, some nine years after its closure as a result of the war. Later investigations carried out by a US commission in collaboration with museum staff found evidence of at least three independent incidents.[1] According to the Commission's findings, the looting was sometimes spontaneous and indiscriminate. However, a number of indications also indicated that some of the thieves had a good knowledge of the museum and expert knowledge of the cultural assets on display. Although particularly valuable objects were kept in the cellar of the museum in the run-up to the war, considerable losses were also incurred here. The Commission corrected initial estimates of some 170,000 stolen works of art to 11,000 to 15,000 stolen objects. By the time the study results were published in 2005, about 5,000 of them had been recovered in various ways.\n\nIn contrast, the Iraqi National Museum in Baghdad was heavily plundered and damaged from 8 to 12 April 2003, some three weeks after the start of the Iraq war. The museum was reopened only three years earlier on 28 April 2000, nine years after its closure as a result of the Second Gulf War. Later investigations carried out by a US commission in collaboration with museum staff found evidence of at least three independent incidents. According to the Commission's findings, the looting was sometimes spontaneous and indiscriminate. However, a number of indications also pointed out that the thieves had a good knowledge of the museum and expert knowledge of the cultural assets on display. Although particularly valuable objects were kept in the cellar of the museum in the run-up to the war, considerable losses were also incurred here. The Commission corrected initial estimates of some 170,000 stolen works of art to 11,000–15,000 stolen objects. By the time the study results were published in 2005, about 5,000 of them had been recovered in various ways.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41406719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41406719", "title": "Harriet Waylett", "text": "Harriet Waylett\n\nHarriet Waylett (1798–1851) was an English actress and theatre manager.\nThe daughter of a tradesman in Bath, Somerset, Harriet Cooke was born there on 7 February 1798; her uncle was a member of the Drury Lane Theatre company, and Sarah Cooke was her cousin. After receiving some instruction in music from one of the Loders of Bath, she appeared on the Bath stage on 16 March 1816 as Elvina in W. R. Hewetson's \"Blind Boy\". She then acted at Coventry, where she met and married in 1819 Waylett, an actor in the company. In 1820 she was at the Adelphi Theatre, where she was the original Amy Robsart in James Planché's adaptation of \"Kenilworth\", and the first Sue to her husband's Primefit in William Moncrieff's \"Tom and Jerry\". She played as \"Mrs. Waylett late Miss Cooke of Bath\".\n\nIn 1823 Mrs. Waylett was acting in Birmingham under Alfred Bunn, playing in Sally Booth's part of Rose Briarly in \"Husbands and Wives\". Her singing of \"Rest thee, Babe\", in \"Guy Mannering\" established her in favour.\n\nMrs. Waylett accompanied her manager Bunn to Drury Lane Theatre, with a reputation as for chambermaid part and as singer. She appeared as Madge in \"Love in a Village\" on 4 December 1824. On 14 January 1825 Mrs. Waylett was Mrs. Page in \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\". She had incurred the jealousy of Bunn's wife, and shortly moved on.\n\nOn 12 May Mrs. Waylett made, as Zephyrina in the \"Lady and the Devil\", her first appearance at the Haymarket Theatre. She stood in high favour as a singer and actress also in Dublin and Cork.\n\nAfter her return from Dublin, Mrs. Waylett played at the Haymarket, Drury Lane, Queen's Theatre, the Olympic Theatre, Covent Garden, and other houses. In 1832 she was acting at the Strand Theatre, where in 1834 she was sole manager. Here she also played original parts. The performances were nominally gratis: admission to the house was in fact by paying four shillings an ounce at a neighbouring shop for sweetmeats, or purchasing tickets for the Victoria Theatre. There were few London houses at which she was not seen, and she was a favourite in the country. In October 1835 she received in Dublin £800 and half a clear benefit for twenty-one nights' performances. In 1838 she was engaged again at the Haymarket.\n\nIn May 1843 Mrs. Waylett, as she was still called after her second marriage, was at the Lyceum Theatre, where she was the President in \"The Ladies' Club\", and played in the farce of \"Matrimony\". Through ill-health her appearances became infrequent, and in 1849 she was spoken of as retired. She died on 29 April 1851, after a long and painful illness. She was thought one of the best soubrettes of her day.\n\nMrs. Waylett's life was associated with many scandals. Before her marriage accompanied to London a Captain Dobyn, against whom her father brought an action for loss of service. It was tried at Taunton and compromised.\n\nFulsome praise of Mrs. Waylett in the \"Theatrical Looker-On\", a Birmingham paper associated in the mind of the Birmingham public with Alfred Bunn, gave rise to a crop of scandals. There were legal threats on Bunn's part, of prosecutions for libel. Bunn demanded an apology for what was said concerning the two as a couple in William Oxberry's \"Dramatic Biography\" in 1827. Oxberry refused to apologise, and there was talk of a duel. Mrs. Waylett was taxed with ostentatiously overdressing the chambermaid parts in which she was seen.\n\nHarriet had married the actor Waylett in 1819; he was a bigamist under the name Fitzwaylett, and died in 1840.

The film is written and directed by conservative political commentator Dinesh D'Souza and Bruce Schooley. The film had a limited release on July 15, 2016, before a wide release on July 22, 2016, and accompanies a book by D'Souza by the same name.\n\nAlthough the film was the top-grossing political documentary of 2016, grossing $13 million against a $5 million budget, most critics gave it negative reviews; review aggregator website Metacritic declared it the worst-received film of 2016. It was nominated for five Golden Raspberry Awards, and won four, including Worst Picture (a first for a documentary film), as well as Worst Director and Worst Actor for D'Souza.\n\nDinesh D'Souza, a conservative author and commentator who co-directed \"Hillary's America\", is known for also directing \"\" (2012), which criticized incumbent president Barack Obama during the 2012 presidential election, and \"\" (2014) arguing against perceived liberal critiques of its history, including the theft of Native American and Mexican lands, black slavery, contemporary foreign policy, and its capitalist system.\n\nThe film begins with scenes of D'Souza at the halfway house where he spent time due to a conviction for making an illegal political contribution. (D'Souza and some of his supporters believe that his prosecution was politically motivated and his sentence was excessive.) The film then switches to examining and criticizing the history of the Democratic Party, from Andrew Jackson to the present day. D'Souza is portrayed going into a basement archive of the DNC Headquarters where he reveals secrets of the party's history.\n\nThe film offers an interpretation of the origins of the Democratic Party in a brief outline, then examines the racism of one of its founders, President Andrew Jackson. It goes on to describe how Jackson and the Democratic Party passed legislation that brutally expelled Native Americans from their land and created the reservation system. This is followed by a political analysis of the historical record of the Democratic Party in the North and South in supporting and defending the institution of slavery, and ensuring its spread into the western territories. It examines the founding of the Republican Party which D'Souza personally suggests was a reaction to the support of slavery by the Democratic Party and their endorsement and defense of fugitive slave laws.\n\nThe film then argues the Democratic Party opposed the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the United States Constitution. The film argues that the Democratic Party had close ties to the Ku Klux Klan in the 19th and 20th centuries, including the accusation that Democratic President Woodrow Wilson supported the KKK and racial segregation, opposed anti-lynching legislation, manipulated New Deal legislation in the 1930s to keep African Americans from benefiting, and opposed civil rights legislation of the 1960s.\n\nThe film also examines the validity of the common argument made by leaders of the Democratic Party that the parties \"switched positions\", with the Democratic Party becoming progressive and Southern racists becoming Republicans, which it rebuts by arguing that fewer than 1 percent of Southern Democrats who opposed civil rights legislation changed parties.\n\nThe film examines the record of the Democratic Party in its use of social welfare programs and machine politics, particularly in urban areas, to create what has been described as a new plantation system, enabling the Democratic Party to exploit and coerce residents. The film then describes the rise and activities of radicals such as Saul Alinsky, who D'Souza believes affected both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton greatly. The film proceeds to examine and criticize the actions of Clinton, questioning her ethics, honesty, and motivations. In a post-credits scene, Dinesh D'Souza appears in front of a classroom, saying \"So how will you know when you have become an American? You'll know, when you become a Republican\", followed by an applause by the students in the classroom.\n\nD'Souza presents various interviews in the film, including:\n\n\"Hillary's America\" had a limited release on July 15, 2016, playing in three theaters in Dallas, Houston, and Phoenix, and making a box office of $77,500. The success of the film during that period was described as \"massively frontloaded\" because it made about $41,000 on the first day. On July 22, 2016, \"Hillary's America\" got a nationwide expansion, entering 1,217 theaters. This date fell between the end of the 2016 Republican National Convention and the beginning of the 2016 Democratic National Convention. On its opening weekend, the film's box office was $3.7 million, in the top ten that weekend. On July 23, 2016, Larry Gatlin and the Gatlin Brothers released the music video \"Stand Up and Say So (Hillary's America)\", a song they wrote and performed for the film.\n\n\"Hillary's America: The Secret of the Democratic Party\" became the highest grossing documentary of 2016 and the 20th-highest domestically of all-time, grossing $13.1 million at the box office. In its opening weekend of wide release it grossed $4 million, finishing 9th at the box office.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 4% based on 27 reviews, and an average rating of 1.7/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \"\"Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party\" finds Dinesh D'Souza once again preaching to the right-wing choir – albeit less effectively than ever.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a score of 2 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \"overwhelming dislike\". The film has the second all-time lowest score in the site's history, after four films (\"Bio-Dome\", \"Chaos\", \"The Singing Forest\", and \"United Passions\") tied with a score of 1.\n\nReviewers from \"The Washington Post\" and \"The New York Times\" described the film as politically partisan.\n\nIn a review for \"IndieWire\", film critic David Ehrlich wrote, \"This is the same old dog and pony show upon which D’Souza has built his brand. It’s his usual shtick of piggybacking a baseless personal attack onto a pseudo history lesson, a feature-length dog whistle that’s blown at a pitch so high that only the most ignorant or paranoid of people are capable of hearing it.\" Writing in \"The Guardian\", Jordan Hoffman described the film as \"paranoid\" and \"so demented that no synopsis could do it justice\" and D'Souza as a \"simpleton\". He goes on to say that the basis of the film, the \"purposely misunderstood fact\" that \"the Republicans used to be the good guys when it came to the issue of racial equality in America\" is as surprising a discovery as the Soviet Union being an ally of the United States in World War II because: \"things change, and labels are semantics, and the concepts that bind a political party then might not be the same ones that bind them now.\" Dann Gire of the \"Boston Herald\" called the film \"an embarrassment to propaganda films\", full of \"mind-boggling conspiracy theories\" and \"fried thoughts and lapses of basic journalistic practices\".\n\nReviewing the film, Alan Zilberman of \"The Washington Post\" stated that \"any conservative voters who check out the latest film … will be disappointed by what they find. Incurious to a fault, it’s also too incoherent for serious argument.\" In addition, Kurt Hyde of \"The New American\" called the film \"a mixed bag\", stating that, among other reasons, although \"parts of the movie were well-researched, the accounts of numerous other events, especially those more than 100 years in the past could have been researched more thoroughly\" and that \"[t]here isn't any great difference between the two parties\", contrary to what the film claimed.\n\nJohn Fund of the \"National Review\" stated that \"[the film] is over the top in places and definitely selective, but the troubling facts are accurate and extensively documented in the D’Souza book that accompanies the movie [and that] the film is intensely patriotic\".\n\nIn response to the Golden Raspberry Awards nominations, D'Souza stated that he was \"actually quite honored\" and called the nominations \"petty revenge\" in response to Trump's election and that \"the film might have played an important role in the election.\" After learning his film had won four of its five nominations, D'Souza recorded a short video accepting the awards, and repeating his view that he won because Razzie members were upset over Trump's election victory.\n\nOn July 23, 2016, Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee (and eventual victor) against Clinton, called on supporters to see the film.\n\n\n"}

He was educated at Walworth Grammar School and was briefly apprenticed on a naval ship at age 10 but returned to school. He studied law and was articled to a solicitor but turned to acting by age 19.\n\nBuckstone first joined a travelling troupe in 1821 as Gabriel in \"The Children in the Wood\". and toured for three years, mostly in the southeast of England. He found a mentor in Edmund Kean. He made his first London appearance, on 30 January 1823, at the Surrey Theatre, as Ramsay in \"The Fortunes of Nigel\". In 1824 he joined that theatre and played Peter Smink in \"The Armistice\" with great success. He also began to write plays.\nHis successes led to his engagement in 1827 at the Adelphi Theatre, where he remained as the leading low comedian until 1833. Buckstone's acting was described as \"a union of shrewdness and drollery, with their interaction upon each other ... was irresistibly comic.\" Buckstone wrote most of his plays in the first half of his career, and many of these were produced at the Adelphi. As his acting career reached the height of its success, his playwriting output declined. At the Adelphi, he appeared as Bobby Trot in his first really successful play, the melodrama \"Luke the Labourer\" (1827), which he had written in 1826. Other well known plays were \"Wreck Ashore\" (1830) and \"Forgery\" (1832) Perhaps the most successful of these early plays was his 1833 play, \"The Bravo\", based on James Fenimore Cooper's novel of the same name.\n\nHe first appeared at the Haymarket Theatre during the summer season in 1833, also writing plays for this theatre, including \"Ellen Wartham\" (1833). Another hit for the Haymarket was the drama \"Thirty Years of a Woman's Life\". At that theatre, his acting was praised in \"The Housekeeper\" by Douglas Jerrold (1833), \"Pyramus and Thisbe\", and in his own plays, \"Uncle John\", \"Rural Felicity\" and \"Agnes de Vere\" (all in 1834). He stayed at the Haymarket until 1838, producing \"The Dream at Sea\" among other plays.\n\nIn 1839–40 he returned to the Adelphi to write and star in a number of plays, including his extraordinarily successful play \"Jack Sheppard\", based on the novel of the same name published that year by William Harrison Ainsworth. After his return from a visit to the United States in 1840, where he met with little success, Buckstone played in his own play, \"Married Life\", at the Haymarket. He then appeared at several London theatres, among them the Lyceum, where he was Box at the first representation of \"Box and Cox\", by John Maddison Morton, in 1847. There he also created the role of Bob, in Dion Boucicault's \"Old Heads and Young Hearts\", and played several other memorable roles, including, Slowboy in \"Cricket on the Hearth\", Dan in \"John Bull\", MacDunnum of Dunnum in \"A School for Scheming\", Scrub in \"The Beaux' Stratagem\" and Golightly in \"Lend Me Five Shillings\", and several Shakespeare roles. For the Adelphi, he wrote \"The Green Bushes\" and \"The Flowers of the Forest\", both in 1847. He also dramatised \"The Last Days of Pompeii\".\n\nHe returned to the Haymarket in 1848, writing and playing in \"An Alarming Sacrifice\", \"Leap Year\" and \"A Serious Family\". During this period, he memorably played Moses in Stirling Coyne's adaptation of \"The Vicar of Wakefield\", Appleface in Jerrold's \"Catspaw\", Shadowly Softhead in Lord Lytton's \"Not as Bad as We Seem\" and in many Shakespeare productions with Mr. and Mrs. Charles Kean.\n\nHe became lessee of the Haymarket from 1853 to 1877. For this theatre, he continued to write plays and farces, though markedly fewer than before. As manager of the Haymarket, he surrounded himself with an admirable and effective ensemble company, including Edward Askew Sothern, Henry Compton, Mr. and Mrs. Charles James Mathews and the Kendals. He produced the plays of James Planché, Thomas William Robertson, Tom Taylor, John Oxenford, H. J. Byron and W. S. Gilbert, as well as his own, and in most of these he acted. Buckstone's management made the Haymarket into the premier comedy theatre of the age. Buckstone's own gifts in comedy contributed much to the theatre's remarkable success. According to \"The Times\", \"Few men... have possessed to a greater extent the power of communicating the spirit of mirth to an audience. ... He was helped, too, in his vocation by remarkable physical attributes\" and a peculiar, hilarious voice.\n\nIn the 1850s, Buckstone produced \"An Unequal Match\" and Taylor's \"The Overland Route\", \"A Hero of Romance\" by Westland Marston, and \"Home\" by Robertson. In 1862, Buckstone produced a 496-night run of \"Our American Cousin\", with Sothern in his most famous role as Lord Dundreary. Robertson's \"David Garrick\" was a hit in 1864, also with Sothern in the title role. W. S. Gilbert premiered seven of his plays at the Haymarket during this time including his blank verse \"fairy comedies\" starring the Kendals, such as \"The Palace of Truth\" (1870), \"Pygmalion and Galatea\" (1871) and \"The Wicked World\" (1873). Buckstone also produced Gilbert's dramas, \"Charity\" (1874) and \"Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith\" (1876), as well as his 1877 farce \"Engaged\". In 1873 Buckstone introduced the innovation of matinées starting at 2.00 pm. By the mid-1870s, however, Buckstone's company was disbanding, and in 1877, ill and bankrupt after sustaining heavy losses, he gave up management of the theatre.\n\nBuckstone was first married in 1828 to Anne Maria Honeyman, with whom he had at least five children before she died in 1844. For many years, Buckstone was closely associated with the actress Fanny Copeland Fitzwilliam, who was widowed in 1852 and whom he was engaged to marry in 1854. She died of cholera a month before the wedding. In 1857 Buckstone married Fanny's cousin Isabella Copeland, the great-niece of the theatre manager Robert Copeland, and they had 12 children between 1857 and 1876. Their daughter, Lucy Isabella Buckstone and their sons John Copeland Buckstone and Rowland Buckstone also took to the stage.\n\nAfter three years of ill health, Buckstone died at his home in Lower Sydenham in 1879 at the age of 77.\n\nAccording to director Nigel Everett and stagehands at the Haymarket Theatre, Buckstone's ghost has often been seen at the theatre, particularly during comedies and \"when he appreciates things\" playing there. In 2009, \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported that the actor Patrick Stewart saw the ghost standing in the wings during a performance of \"Waiting for Godot\" at the Haymarket.\n\n"}

Ducha\") in place of the former 14th century church and monastery of religious order 'Duchacy' or Order of the Holy Ghost (hence the name of the square). The church had been converted into a residential building due to secularization of the Polish male branch of the cloister in 1783. The city council of Kraków decided to demolish it in 1886 in order to make room for a new theatre. The church was dismantled in May 1892an event which caused much controversy, notably the emotive declaration of Polish painter Jan Matejko, that he would never exhibit his paintings in Kraków again.\n\nThe new theatre opened on October 21, 1893. It was an exquisite example of the Polish Eclectic architecture, the first building in Kraków designed for and equipped with electric light. Initially it was called Municipal Theatre (\"Teatr Miejski\"). Only in 1909 did it receive the name of Juliusz Słowacki, a Polish poet and playwright of Romanticism.\n\nInauguration took place with a program consisting of excerpts from Aleksander Fredro's \"Zemsta\", Juliusz Słowacki's \"Balladyna\" and Adam Mickiewicz's \"Konfederaci Barscy\". The theatre staged its first full-length production, Fredro's \"Śluby Panieńskie\", four days later.\n\nDuring Nazi Germany occupation of Poland, the theatre was run by a German troupe. The last Polish play for the next 6 years was produced in Autumn 1939. The theatre reopened for Polish audience in February 1945.\n\nSince March 27, 1976, the theatre is accompanied by the Small Stage housed in the former electric plant (designed in 1890s, to provide the theatre with its own electricity). In 2000 a third stage was added, the summertime Next to the Pump Stage. A fourth one (Stage in the Gate) opened on November 7, 2003.\n\nThe first director of the Theatre was Tadeusz Pawlikowski (1893–1899), followed by Józef Kotarbiński (1899–1905) and Ludwik Solski (1905–1913). Tadeusz Pawlikowski resumed this position in the years 1913-1915. Playwright Lucjan Rydel became the Theatre's director for one season during 1915-1916. Adam Grzymala-Siedlecki took that role in the years 1916-1918.\n\nAfter World War I, the theatre was directed by Teofil Trzciński (1918–1926), Zygmunt Nowakowski (1926–1929), once again Trzciński (1929–1932), Juliusz Osterwa (1932–1935) and Karol Frycz (1935–1939). Frycz and Osterwa became the directors again after World War II (Frycz from 1945–1946, and Osterwa in 1946-1947). The next directors were Bronisław Dąbrowski (1947–1950) and Henryk Szletyński (1950–1955). Bronisław Dąbrowski was once again appointed as director from 1955-1972. Krystyna Skuszanka and Jerzy Krasowski directed the theatre from 1972 to 1981. Andrzej Kijowski's short period of directorship ended the same year with the imposition of martial law in Poland. Mikołaj Grabowski (1982–1985) was followed by Jan Paweł Gawlik (1985–1989), Jan Prochyra (1989–1990), Jerzy Goliński (1990–1992) and Bogdan Hussakowski (1992–1999). Current director of the theatre is Krzysztof Orzechowski.\n\nThe Theatre became the birthplace of the theatrical concept of the Young Poland movement and was closely related to the rediscovery of Romantic drama as well as the premiere productions of plays by Polish national playwright Stanisław Wyspiański.\n\nThe significance of the Polish Romantic tradition under the foreign occupation and especially Słowacki's legacy was reflected in the first festival of his plays organized there in 1909. It was at this time that the Theatre adopted the name of Słowacki and became known as Juliusz Słowacki Theatre.\n\nAt the Theatre, the audiences could witness actors such as Kazimierz Kamiński, Ludwik Solski, Maksymilian Węgrzyn, Antonina Hoffman, Wanda Siemaszkowa, Stanisława Wysocka and Aleksander Zelwerowicz. Theatre artists like Juliusz Osterwa and Kazmierz Junosza-Stepowski began their careers at the Słowacki Theatre, and Helena Modrzejewska made numerous guest appearances. During the interwar period, the theatre was overshadowed by the Warsaw theatre scene, but still it was considered to be one of the most important stages in Poland. In 1980 the Słowacki Theatre staged the world premiere of Pope John Paul II \"Our God's Brother\" (\"\"), a production whose significance was above all political.\n\n\n"}

It is held in a private collection in Japan.\n\nChagall paintings often feature young women or couples, but in \"La Mariée\" the focus is on a singular young woman in quasi-wedding attire with a bouquet of flowers. Described by a Chagall fans as \"an ode to young love\", the woman is presented to the viewer in a bold and conspicuous fashion, as if the viewer is the one marrying her.\n\nThe second peculiarity of \"La Mariée\" compared to the majority of other Chagall paintings is the choice of colors. The young woman is dressed in a red dress lively, with a virginal white veil draped over her head, while the background is mostly a mix of fresh and soft blue and gray. This effect allows the image of the woman to jump off the canvas and attract the viewer's attention. It is evident that Chagall has attempted to highlight the woman, as is tradition in every marriage.\n\nThe wedding is the major theme of the painting, and includes a feature found in other Chagall paintings and in many other European artworks of the twentieth century, animals playing musical instruments. In this case it's a goat playing a violin. The painting also shows a man hanging over the head of the bride with his hands on her veil, a church which stands in the background almost as an afterthought, a man playing a flute, a girl with pigtails, a fish with arms holding a candle and a chair, several more buildings, and a rooster.\n\nIn the 1999 film \"Notting Hill\", Julia Roberts' character Anna Scott sees a poster of \"La Mariée\" in the home of Hugh Grant's character, William Thacker. Anna later gives William what is presumably the original.\n\nAccording to director Roger Michell in an article in \"Entertainment Weekly\", the painting was chosen because screenwriter Richard Curtis was a fan of Chagall's work, and because \"La Mariée\" \"depicts a yearning for something that's lost.\" Producers had a reproduction made for use in the film, but had to first get permission from the painting's owners and obtain clearance from the British Design and Artists Copyright Society. Finally, according to producer Duncan Kenworthy, \"... we had to agree to destroy it. They were concerned that if our fake was too good, it might float around the market and create problems.\" The article notes that the canvas used in the film could have been \"worth between $500,000 and $1 million.\" \n"}

In fact, the Hegelian dialectic was considered best displayed in film editing through the Kuleshov Experiment and the development of montage.\n\nWhile this structuralist approach to Marxism and filmmaking was used, the more vociferous complaint that the Russian filmmakers had was with the narrative structure of the cinema of the United States.\n\nEisenstein's solution was to shun narrative structure by eliminating the individual protagonist and tell stories where the action is moved by the group and the story is told through a clash of one image against the next (whether in composition, motion, or idea) so that the audience is never lulled into believing that they are watching something that has not been worked over.\n\nEisenstein himself, however, was accused by the Soviet authorities under Joseph Stalin of \"formalist error,\" of highlighting form as a thing of beauty instead of portraying the worker nobly.\n\nFrench Marxist film makers, such as Jean-Luc Godard, would employ radical editing and choice of subject matter, as well as subversive parody, to heighten class consciousness and promote Marxist ideas.\n\nSituationist film maker Guy Debord, author of \"The Society of the Spectacle\", began his film \"In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni\" [Wandering around in the night we are consumed by fire] with a radical critique of the spectator who goes to the cinema to forget about his dispossessed daily life.\n\nSituationist film makers produced a number of important films, where the only contribution by the situationist film cooperative was the sound-track. In \"Can dialectics break bricks?\" (1973) a Chinese Kung Fu film was transformed by redubbing into an epistle on state capitalism and Proletarian revolution. The intellectual technique of using capitalism's own structures against itself is known as détournement. \n\nMarxist film theory has developed from these precise and historical beginnings and is now sometimes viewed in a wider way to refer to any power relationships or structures within a moving image text. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "718763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=718763", "title": "Narratology", "text": "Narratology\n\nNarratology is the study of narrative and narrative structure and the ways that these affect our perception. While in principle the word may refer to any systematic study of narrative, in practice its usage is rather more restricted. It is an anglicisation of French \"narratologie\", coined by Tzvetan Todorov (\"Grammaire du Décaméron\", 1969). Narratology is applied retrospectively as well to work predating its coinage. Its theoretical lineage is traceable to Aristotle (\"Poetics\") but modern narratology is agreed to have begun with the Russian Formalists, particularly Vladimir Propp (\"Morphology of the Folktale\", 1928), and Mikhail Bakhtin's theories of heteroglossia, dialogism, and the chronotope first presented in \"The Dialogic Imagination\" (1975).\n\nThe origins of narratology lend to it a strong association with the structuralist quest for a formal system of useful description applicable to any narrative content, by analogy with the grammars used as a basis for parsing sentences in some forms of linguistics. This procedure does not however typify all work described as narratological today; Percy Lubbock's work in point of view (\"The Craft of Fiction\", 1921) offers a case in point.\n\nIn 1966 a special issue of the journal \"Communications\" proved highly influential, becoming considered a program for research into the field and even a manifesto. It included articles by Barthes, Claude Brémond, Genette, Greimas, Todorov and others, which in turn often referred to the works of Vladimir Propp (1895–1970).\n\nJonathan Culler (2001) describes narratology as comprising many strands \nimplicitly united in the recognition that narrative theory requires a distinction between \"story,\" a sequence of actions or events conceived as independent of their manifestation in discourse, and \"discourse,\" the discursive presentation or narration of events.'\nThe Russian Formalists first proposed such a distinction, employing the couplet fabula and sujet. A subsequent succession of alternate pairings has preserved the essential binomial impulse, e.g. \"histoire\"/\"discours\", \"histoire\"/\"récit\", \"story\"/\"plot\". The Structuralist assumption that one can investigate fabula and sujet separately gave birth to two quite different traditions: thematic (Propp, Bremond, Greimas, Dundes, et al.) and modal (Genette, Prince, et al.) narratology. The former is mainly limited to a semiotic formalization of the sequences of the actions told, while the latter examines the manner of their telling, stressing voice, point of view, transformation of the chronological order, rhythm and frequency. Many authors (Sternberg, 1993, Ricoeur, 1984, and Baroni, 2007) have insisted that thematic and modal narratology should not be looked at separately, especially when dealing with the function and interest of narrative sequence and plot.\n\nJames Phelan, editor of \"Narrative\" (the journal of the International Society for the Study of Narrative), has written numerous books and articles on narrative theory (see reference list). With Frederick Luis Aldama, Brian McHale and Robyn Warhol, Phelan directs Project Narrative at The Ohio State University:)\n\nDesignating work as narratological is to some extent dependent more on the academic discipline in which it takes place than any theoretical position advanced. The approach is applicable to any narrative, and in its classic studies, vis-a-vis Propp, non-literary narratives were commonly taken up. Still the term \"narratology\" is most typically applied to literary theory and literary criticism, as well as film theory and (to a lesser extent) film criticism. Atypical applications of narratological methodologies would include sociolinguistic studies of oral storytelling (William Labov) and in conversation analysis or discourse analysis that deal with narratives arising in the course of spontaneous verbal interaction. It also includes the study of videogames, graphic novels, the infinite canvas, and narrative sculptures linked to topology and graph theory.\nHowever, constituent analysis of a type where narremes are considered to be the basic units of narrative structure could fall within the areas of linguistics, semiotics, or literary theory.\n\n\n\n"}

In a what was considered a minor sacrilege, the painting was absconded in 1640 by duke Francesco I d'Este and taken to his private gallery, it was moved to Dresden in 1746.\n\nThe artist, following the trail blazed by a number of celebrated works by Titian, interpreted a scene that is fully 'à la chandell' (\"of the candle\") and produced an outstanding result in the Chiaroscuro treatment of light. The scene pivots around the Child, surrounded by Mary's arms, with a group of shepherds on the left, of which the bearded figure is portrayed in the same position of Jerome in the \"Madonna of St. Jerome (Correggio)\" (c. 1523).

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 29, 2009. The episode was directed by Greg Colton and written by Danny Smith. In the episode, Quahog hosts its annual \"Star Trek\" convention and the cast members of \"\" are guests. After he was unable to ask the actors any questions at a Q&A session, Stewie builds a transporter in his bedroom to beam the cast over and spend the day with them. Meanwhile, Meg becomes a born-again Christian and tries to convert the atheist Brian to Christianity.\n\nThe episode garnered mixed reviews from critics and received a 4.8/7 Nielsen rating. \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\"s Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, Gates McFadden, Michael Dorn, Wil Wheaton, Denise Crosby, and Marina Sirtis all guest starred as themselves, and Adam West and Rob Lowe appear at the end of the episode in a live-action scene.\n\nMeg catches the mumps when the Griffins attend Quahog's annual \"Star Trek\" convention, because Peter forced her to stand next to an irresponsible attendee with the mumps to take a picture, believing him to be in costume as an alien. While recovering in bed, Meg becomes a born-again Christian after watching Kirk Cameron on television and begins irritating everyone with her beliefs. Meg is horrified to learn that Brian is an atheist and attempts to convince him to repent and convert to Christianity, but he repeatedly refuses. Finally taking drastic measures, Meg spreads the word of Brian's atheism around Quahog, which generally hates atheists, making him a social outcast.\n\nUpon being made an outcast, Brian is banned from every bar and convenience store in Quahog, making it impossible for him to drown his sorrows. Desperate, and suffering from delirium tremens (he hallucinates seeing several alcoholic beverages begging him to drink them), Brian fakes his repentance and convinces Meg to cease all hostilities against him so he can get back to drinking, but she takes him to burn books that are \"harmful to God\" (including \"On the Origin of Species\" by Charles Darwin, \"A Brief History of Time\" by Stephen Hawking, and a book titled \"Logic for First Graders\"). A disgusted Brian admits his bluff and attempts to convince Meg that what she is doing is wrong. When Meg refuses to listen, Brian points out to her that if there were truly a loving God, then he would not have created Meg to have an attractive mother like Lois but have her to more physically resemble Peter, and that she would not be born into a family where everyone holds her in contempt and otherwise pretends that she does not exist (not even caring enough to get her a mumps vaccine). Feeling ashamed, Meg concedes to Brian's argument and apologizes for her behavior, confessing that she does not know how she can feel loved. Brian then assures her that the answers are inside herself, and the real meaning of their existence is out there somewhere. Afterward, it is revealed that the entire \"Family Guy\" universe takes place within the molecules of a lampshade in the shared bedroom of Adam West and Rob Lowe.\n\nMeanwhile, furious that he did not get a chance to ask the cast of \"\" any questions at the convention, and the fact that the cast instead answered questions completely unrelated to \"Star Trek\", Stewie builds an authentic \"Star Trek\" transporter and beams the cast over to interview them (in a nod to the TNG episode \"Skin of Evil\", Denise Crosby is killed in a show of force). Stewie decides to spend the whole day with the cast, which includes stealing Cleveland's van, having lunch at McDonald's, going bowling, and going to a carnival. However, they complain about minor things and greatly annoy Stewie, who beams everyone back after stating that they have ruined \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" for him.\n\n\"Not All Dogs Go to Heaven\" was directed by series regular Greg Colton, in his second episode of the season (his first one being \"Road to Germany\"). It was written by regular writer and recurring voice actor Danny Smith, in his first episode of the season. Series regulars Peter Shin and James Purdum served as supervising directors. Seth MacFarlane, \"Family Guy\"s creator and executive producer, is a fan of \"Star Trek\" and made two guest appearances as engineer Ensign Rivers on \"\", in \"\" (season 3, episode 20) and \"\" (season 4, episode 15). Former \"\" cast members have also made other appearances in \"Family Guy\": Patrick Stewart, for example, briefly voiced Peter Griffin (normally played by MacFarlane) in \"No Meals on Wheels\" (season 5, episode 14), his \"American Dad!\" character, Avery Bullock in \"Lois Kills Stewie\" (season 6, episode 5), and his \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" character Captain Jean-Luc Picard in \"Peter's Got Woods\" (season 4, episode 11); Jonathan Frakes, Michael Dorn and Marina Sirtis also appeared in \"Peter's Got Woods\" as their respective \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" characters William Riker, Worf, and Counsellor Deanna Troi.\n\n\"Not All Dogs Go to Heaven\" features the entire original cast of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\": Stewart as Captain Picard; Frakes as Riker; Gates McFadden as Doctor Beverly Crusher; Brent Spiner as Lieutenant Commander Data; Dorn as Worf; Sirtis as Troi; LeVar Burton as Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge; Wil Wheaton as Wesley Crusher; and Denise Crosby, whose character Tasha Yar died during \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\"s first season. It is also the first time the cast, minus Crosby, has worked together since the 2002 feature film \"Star Trek Nemesis\", although the actors did not meet when they recorded their speaking parts. Including Crosby, the last time that the entire cast worked together was the 1990 episode \"Yesterday's Enterprise\".\n\nWil Wheaton, who played Wesley Crusher on \"\", recorded his parts for the episode on September 20, 2007. Seth MacFarlane directed the recording sessions with the guest stars.\n\n\"Not All Dogs Go to Heaven\" received a 4.8/7 Nielsen Rating. \n\nAhsan Haque of \"IGN\" called the episode \"surprisingly refreshing\", saying the scenes with the \"Star Trek\" cast lived up to expectations. He also found \"Meg's journey of seeking acceptance through religion\" well handled. Steve Heisler of \"The A.V. Club\" gave the episode a C grade, criticized \"Not All Dogs Go to Heaven\" as boring and formulaic and stated that the writers \"have no idea how to best use Meg\".\n\n"}

The book's three chapters are \"Black Matters\", \"Romancing the Shadow\", and \"Disturbing Nurses and the Kindness of Sharks\".\n\nWriting in \"Signs\", Linda Krumholz described Morrison's project as \"reread[ing] the American literary canon through an analysis of whiteness to propose the ways that black people were used to establish American identity.\"\n\nReviewing \"Playing in the Dark\" in \"The New York Times\" in 1992, Wendy Steiner said: \"The moral and emotional force of [Morrison's] explorations is apparent. If the American identity is formed against this black shadow, it is a sign of abject weakness and a cause for shame...The genius of Ms. Morrison's approach is to enlist those very describers and imaginers—white men of letters—in an investigation that can end only in their self-indictment.\" But, Steiner added, \"it is also not a mere denunciation of white culture. Instead, it is a self-help project meant both to map out new critical territory and to rearrange the territory within.\"\n\nMichael Eric Dyson observes that in addition to this exploration of the \"white literary imagination...\"Playing in the Dark\" is also about a black intellectual seizing the interpretive space within a racially ordered hierarchy of cultural criticism. Blacks are usually represented through the lens of white perception rather than the other way around...With [\"Playing in the Dark\"], a substantial change is portended.\"\n\nIn 2016, \"Time\" magazine noted that \"Playing in the Dark\" was among Morrison's most-assigned texts on U.S. college campuses, together with several of her novels and her 1993 Nobel Prize lecture, making her one of the most-assigned of all female writers.\n\n"}

{"id": "35121874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35121874", "title": "Shekhawati painting", "text": "Shekhawati painting\n\nThe region of Shekhawati in Rajasthan is remarkable for its wealth of mural paintings which adorn the walls of many buildings, including havelis.\n\nShekhawati describes a district, or nizamat, of the pre-Independence kingdom of Dhundar or Jaipur. This region was ruled by descendants of the 15th century Rajput baron, Rao Shekha, who were known as Shekhawats. It is covered by the two modern districts of Jhunjhunu and Sikar. Churu district lay in the neighbouring kingdom of Bikaner, but its nearest towns to the north and west, although never part of Shekhawati, contain similar painted buildings.\n\nTraces of wall paintings are found on Shekhawati structures erected by Muslim nawabs, Rajputs and Banias dating back to the 17th century. A local style was influenced by 16th/17th century Mughal work in Agra and Fatehpur Sikri via painted monuments in Amer. The earliest dated Shekhawati work includes the ‘Jaipur fresco’ work, which was employed before Jaipur’s foundation by craftsmen employed by Mughal rulers and in Amer. This involves thick layers of pigment being applied and worked onto a wet plaster surface. The pigment is often incised scraperboard-like with geometric and floral designs. The interior work is usually painted secco, using tempera, onto dry plaster.\n\nIn the few surviving 17th century painted buildings some popular Jahangir period (1605–27) subjects such as winged-head cherubs (from Baroque Europe via Goa), hatted Persian angels, the pheasant-like simurgh, cypress trees, lotus bud decoration and the Sufi tale of the lovers Laila and Majnu may be integrated with popular Hindu religious and folk themes. Early 18th century structures in Udaipurwati, Jhunjhunu district, such as Jokhi Das ki Chhatri, dated 1702, and the c1700 Chaturbhuj Temple at Nathusar, Sikar district, even include portraits of the emperor Aurangzeb (1658-1707). Most of these early murals are painted in red, yellow and green ochres but green copper carbonate and both white and red lead also feature in the palette.\n\nIn the 18th century, under the patronage of Rajput rulers and Vaishya merchants, a number of temples and chhatris were richly decorated with figurative paintings. Some forts also contained painted rooms. Again, ochres formed the general palette and the figures were largely drawn from the Hindu pantheon. Amongst other subjects chosen are stylised portraits, hunting scenes, folk tales and historic battles, particularly the Battle of Maonda 1767, in temples, or in chhatris which commemorated those who fought or died. Good examples are in small c1700 temples east of Sri Madhopur at Bagriawas, Nathusar and Lisaria, both Sikar district, in the chhatri (1750) and temple (1742) at Parasrampura, Jhunjhunu district, the 8-pillar chhatri (1776) in Churu and, perhaps by the same hand, the Bihari Temple in Jhunjhunu (1777). Such painting continued into the 19th century in forts, like those at Mandawa, Nawalgarh and Mahansar, all in Jhunjhunu district, as well as temples and chhatris, often using a richer palette.\n\nApart from a few temples and chhatris, merchant monuments predating an 1818 treaty between Jaipur and the new British regime were lightly painted externally with floral motifs and arabesques.\n\nThe great merchant era of patronage began around 1830 when Shekhawati merchants, settled in Calcutta and elsewhere, began to pour money back to their hometowns, much of which was turned to conspicuous building. By then, under British protection, they were no longer shy of drawing attention to their wealth. The most obvious blossoming of wall-paintings in Shekhawati is on late 19th and early 20th century havelis. They aimed to construct five buildings: a haveli, a temple, a memorial chhatri, a well and a caravansarai. Most were painted. The havelis offer the most variable subject matter, but temples, memorial chhatris and cupolas decorating wells are often richly decorated.\n\nThe building boom attracted many Muslim chejaras, masons, and Hindu kumhars, members of the potter caste who became masons, to Shekhawati. The painters were mostly gifted, self-taught men drawn from amongst them. For the finest work, teams of professional painters were called in from the Jaipur direction. Where painters have signed, they are from Jaipur or its vicinity. Masons whose ancestors painted often talk of their family migrating from the southeast.\n\nThe walls themselves are the richest source of information on techniques and scientific studies confirm their account. Half-finished work is always informative. Murals on the unfinished ceiling of Gopinath Temple, Parasrampura (1742) show that the pictures, though continuous, were drawn and coloured piecemeal on the dry plaster surface. Lines in charcoal and red ochre were corrected. Outlines of groups of figures were drawn, then corrected and reach their final form when the artist paints them in, colour by colour. There is no trace of drawing away from the tracts of plaster the painter was decorating. Most was done freehand, but on other buildings there are clear signs of dotted stencilled outlines; arcs and straight lines were aided by string. Townscapes were constructed with a straight-edge. Unfinished examples depicting Jaipur survive in a Nawalgarh chhatri and in Khetri’s Bakhtawar Mahal. The pigments were mixed with an adhesive, often gum from the common plant, akra but also egg or saresh, gum made from camel bone. \n‘Jaipur Fresco’ work on the outer walls of havelis shows construction lines created by a taut string covered with ochre or charcoal dust flicked against the wet plaster, leaving an imprint and colour. Rapid freehand sketches with a sharp stylus, often corrected, have left their mark in the plaster surface. The paint was applied in blocks of thick pigment massaged against the wet lime surface to be partially integrated with calcium carbonate as it forms. The surface was burnished with agate and polished with coconut flesh. Some fine details such as jewellery were added in tempera and stand proud of the surface.\n\nUntil the mid 19th century the paints were mineral or vegetable pigments. Ochres dominated but in finer interior work red and white lead, cinnabar, indigo, lapis lazuli, copper carbonate, vivid Indian yellow. The lead pigments were prone to oxidisation, blackening. From the mid 19th century, Germany’s industrial revolution created chemically synthesised pigments which were soon cheaply available. Ultramarine blue (from artificial lapis) and chrome red dominated external paintings after 1860. By the close of the 19th century many more colours were available, sometimes in jarring combinations.\n\nThese dominate all the pictures. Most relate to the ten or twenty-four most common incarnations of Vishnu. Of these Rama and Krishna are by far the most popular. Shaivite subjects, particularly Shiva, Ganesh and Durga are commonplace. Ganesh presides over every doorway. Brahma occurs but his consort, Saraswati, is more frequent. Local deities such as Gugaji, Ramdevji and Pabuji appear infrequently.\n\nFolk tales are generally depicted by a single image, the most striking event in the story. In Dhola-Maru, the popular Rajasthani story, Dhola and his wife Maru are shown on a camel fleeing from the wicked bandit, Umra-Sumra. Maru turns to let fly a stream of arrows at him. Punjabi tales such as Heer-Ranjha, Sohni-Mehwal, Sassi-Punu and Binjo-Sorath all feature but the Middle Eastern Sufi tale, Laila-Majnu, is one of the earliest to be depicted. Many other less familiar stories appear, the significance of some now forgotten.\n\nRecognisable, or labelled, portraits of historical figures, both Indian and British, feature. These range from Mughal rulers and heroes who opposed them, local princes, British monarchs down to Freedom Fighters including Gandhi. Historical events occur, too, one being the Battle of Maonda, 1767. European figures are often used to accompany technical innovations including pumps, cars, ships, planes and bicycles.\n\nThe painters often draw from their surroundings, depicting farmers at work, folk drawing water from a well, potters, goldsmiths, swordsmiths, carpenters and, occasionally, masons building and painting walls. Domestic and wild animals, birds and plants are commonly depicted.\n\nPictures of couples making love are usually cheekily hidden amongst murals on external walls. Sometimes there are depictions of bestiality; men with donkeys or dogs, women with dogs. Homosexuality is very rarely depicted; self-conscious householders sometimes obliterate erotic paintings.\n\nOccasionally a team of painters has been commissioned to paint Jaipur or the local town. An excellent example is in the palace sheesh \nmahal at Sikar, where the walled town, complete with people and traffic, is neatly depicted as it was in 1864. The most accessible is in a bastion of the main fort in Nawalgarh, where both Jaipur and Nawalgarh were painted c1850 on the domed ceiling. Other pictures show recognisable local or distant buildings, the Taj Mahal being popular.\n\nStylised plants or plant-like arabesques, architectural features and geometric patterns are common, chosen for subjects in panels, friezes dividing walls or in spandrels of arches.\n\nTowards the mid 20th century successful merchants committed themselves to a new urban existence, rarely visiting the homeland save for ritual or charity purposes. Investing in industry, some of these families have become amongst the richest in India. Rented out, locked or neglected, havelis and chhatris are suffering. Wells have been superseded by hand-pumps then by tapped water. Buildings collapse, are whitewashed or are demolished to make way for some new structure. Old paintings are replaced by inferior new work. There is currently no legislation to protect such buildings. Interest inspired by the publication of Wacziarg and Nath's book on the paintings in 1982 led to INTACH commissioning a documentation of the buildings; many of those surveyed in 1985-87 have since disappeared. Attempts are being made by some groups, such as the Morarka family of Nawalgarh, to create an interest in preserving some of the buildings.\n\nIn recent years, the Government has undertaken some efforts towards spreading awareness about this unique art heritage. Both the Jawahar Kala Kendra in Jaipur and the National Crafts Museum in Delhi have specially commissioned works of Shekhawati frescoes on their walls. Sustainable heritage tourism is being seen as one way of both ensuring the protection and conservation of this art. The hoteliers and heritage conservationists Francis Wacziarg and Aman Nath's \"Rajasthan: The Painted Walls of Shekhavati\" and Ilay Cooper's \"The Painted Towns of Shekhawati\" are important works on these murals.\n\nIn 2012, the Department of Posts issued a stamp commemorating the Shekhawati paintings.\n\n\n"}

It was inaugurated with the staging of the tragedy \"Matilde\" by Simon Falconio Pratoli. After hosting a season of \"opera seria\" in 1730, the Valle was limited through much of the latter half of the 18th century to staging prose dramas as well as a mix of intermezzos and comic operas, particularly those of Galuppi, Piccinni, Anfossi, Sacchini, Paisiello, Guglielmi, and Cimarosa. It was the only theatre in Rome in 1782, and after 1786, which offered both spring and autumn seasons of opera as well a season during Carnival.\n\nThroughout the early 19th century, the Valle was regularly staging \"opera buffa\" and \"opera semiseria\" as well as prose comedies and, increasingly after 1830, serious melodramas. A number of operas during this time were premiered at the Valle, including Rossini’s \"Demetrio e Polibio\" (1812), \"Torvaldo e Dorliska\" (1815), and \"La Cenerentola\" (1817); Mercadante’s \"Il geloso ravveduto\" (1820); Donizetti’s \"L'ajo nell'imbarazzo\" (1824), \"Olivo e Pasquale\" (1827), \"Il furioso all’isola di San Domingo\" (1833), and \"Torquato Tasso\" (1833); Pacini’s \"La gioventù di Enrico V\" (1820); and Luigi Ricci’s \"L’orfana di Ginevra\" (1829), \"Il sonnambulo\" (1829), and \"Chi dura vince\" (1834), as well as many lesser known works from local composers.\n\nBeginning from the middle of the 19th century, the Teatro Valle has staged only spoken drama. Pirandello's \"Six Characters in Search of an Author\" had its world premiere in the theatre in 1921.\n\nThe seating in the Teatro Valle initially consisted of five tiers of 27 boxes. It underwent renovation in by Mauro Fontana in 1765 and was restored again in 1791. The theatre was rebuilt in 1821 to the design of Valadier, completed by Salvi and in 1845 a façade designed by Gaspare Servi was added. Today, it contains four tiers of boxes and a gallery.\n\nThe \"Ente teatrale italiano\", a state organization to promote Italian theater which partially supported the Teatro Valle, was shut down in 2010 as part of the Italian government's budget cuts for the arts in general. In June 2011, amidst rumours that the theatre was to be privatised and would lose its artistic independence, the building was occupied by a group of protesters consisting of actors, musicians, directors, technicians, and creative staff. As of June 2012, the theatre remained occupied by the group.\n"}

Nevertheless, he developed his own lyrical manner using soft, subdued tones.\n\n\"The Lute Player\" depicts a young woman in a golden dress with a lute, turned away from the observer, concentrating her attention on the nineteen stringed instrument and listening intently to a note. She may be tuning her lute in anticipation of a concert, as shown by the assortment of recorders, a cornetto and violin, and the song books lying open on the table before her. The painting is rich in its renderings of fabrics. It can be taken as a genre scene or as a portrait, but since many of the paintings of its time included some allegorical message, it can also represent the allegory of hearing or a portrayal of Harmonia, the Greek goddess of harmony and concord.\n\n\"The Lute Player\" is influenced by Caravaggio's early genre scenes, especially Caravaggio's own c. 1600 painting of the same name in the Hermitage Museum. In turn, Gentileschi's painting was the inspiration for Giuseppe Crespi's c. 1700–1705 \"\". Christiansen & Mann note that Gentileschi returned to Caravaggio's early Giorgionesque work, exemplified by paintings such as the c. 1594–1596 \"\", as guidance for his departure from mainstream Caravaggism that \"The Lute Player\" represents.\n\n\n\n"}

The painting depicts three young ladies, from the Vickers family, in their estate in Bolsover Hill, Sheffield, England.\n\nThe Misses Vickers, painted in 1884 by John Singer Sargent, is a portrait of three sisters, Florence Evelyn Vickers, Mabel Frances Vickers, and Clara Mildred Vickers. The portrait was commissioned by their father, Colonel Thomas Vickers, a wealthy industrialist. Following its completion, \"The Misses Vickers\" was first exhibited at the Salon of 1885 alongside a portrait of Mrs. Albert Vickers, completed by Sargent in June 1884. Sargent later exhibited \"The Misses Vickers\" with \"Mrs. Albert Vickers\" and \"Portrait of Mrs. Robert Harrison\" at the Royal Academy in 1886. Despite Colonel Vickers being pleased with the portrait, art critics at the Salon of 1885 overlooked it. The general opinion was less than enthusiastic, but one anonymous critic from The Spectator felt that the portrait was “in its way probably the cleverest thing in the exhibition. It is the ne plus ultra of French painting, or rather, of the French method as learned by a foreigner.”\n\n\"The Misses Vickers\" tells a story through Sargent's use of delicate brushwork and stark contrasts. The three figures are all seated in the foreground, yet two are seated on a couch and one is slightly behind them, seated in a chair. The two sisters on the couch are busy looking through a book, seemingly oblivious to Sargent or the viewer, yet the third sister, though she is positioned with her back to the viewer, is looking directly out of the picture plane. Sargent's use of warm highlights allows the sisters to stand out against a dark background, and their positioning is balanced and natural. Looking at the figures, one can't help but feel that one has just walked through a door, into the parlor, and stumbled upon the exquisitely ordinary scene. By fixing the eyes of the third sister outward, Sargent allows the viewer to connect with her, and because the three subjects are seated rather than standing, one is allowed to gaze down upon them, rather than gazing up at them, as is often the case with twentieth-century portraits of aristocrats. These sisters appear common and average, in both grouping and dress. Their wealth is not what grabs the eye, it is simply an afterthought, after one sees their humility and intellect. Many paintings in the twentieth century feature women simply as things of beauty that are to be looked at, but Sargent gives a depth and individuality to each of these three sisters. Yes, they are beautiful, but they are also deep-thinking and intellectual beings. \n\nSargent was an admirer of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, an art movement founded by Dante Gabriel Rossetti in 1848. Rossetti's own portraits of women served as aesthetic inspiration to Sargent. It has been noted that grouping of the three sisters in The Misses Vickers is very similar to \"The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit\", a portrait painted by Sargent in 1882. There are also formal similarities to \"Hearts are Trumps\", a group portrait of the Misses Armstrong painted by Sir John Everett Millais in 1872.\n\nSargent was commissioned to paint the Vickers sisters just before his 1884 exhibition of \"Portrait of Madame X\", a painting which was met with controversy and negativity from critics and the general public, who felt that the painting was overly-sexual. Though Sargent left Paris soon after the negative critiques of his portrait of Madame Gautreau and feared that he would lose the business of those who had already commissioned him for portraits, Colonel Vickers did not withdraw his request. In July, Sargent travelled to the Vickers’ estate in Sheffield to begin the portrait. Following the competition of the portrait of his daughters, Colonel Vickers commissioned portraits of his wife and sons, and eventually Sargent was commissioned to paint the portraits of thirteen members of the extended Vickers family. In addition to being their portraitist, Sargent knew the Vickers family on a personal level, and became a regular guest at family dinners and parties.\n\nFollowing the wealthy, glamorous, and often-flashy clientele of Paris, Sargent viewed the commission from Colonel Vickers, a businessman and head of a well-respected family, as a regression from what his career had been. He described his subjects as “three ugly women” who “lived in a dingy hole,” though the disdain he seems to have felt for his subjects is not readily apparent in the portrait itself. Despite the obvious wealth of the three subjects, Sargent includes everyday objects, such as two cups of tea, a small pitcher of milk, and a piano, giving the painting a more casual tone. Sargent chooses to paint the sisters in fine day dresses with yards of material draping across their laps and spilling out of the sofa and chair they are seated upon, yet the painting is calm and doesn't feel overly -frivolous. The same highlights that Sargent uses to illuminate their faces also reflect off their satin dresses, and though the scene is quiet, still, and contemplative, Sargent includes one detail of implied movement in the form of a book. The two sisters seated on the couch are flipping through a book, and though Sargent has painted all other elements in this scene with clarity, the pages of the book are blurred. Because of the objects within the scene and the positioning of the sisters, the scene manages to be both still and active at the same time, and the three Vickers sisters appear humble, despite their wealth. Thus, \"The Misses Vickers\" is a painting of opposites.\n\n\"The Times\" of May 22, 1886 reviewed the painting as follows:\n\n"}

The book was so named because out of 193 species of monkeys and apes, only humans (\"Homo sapiens sapiens\") are not covered in hair. Desmond Morris, the author, who had been the curator of mammals at London Zoo, said his book was intended to popularise and demystify science.\n\nMorris said that \"Homo sapiens\" not only have the largest brains of all higher primates, but that sexual selection in human evolution has caused humans to have the highest ratio of penis size to body mass. Morris conjectured that human ear-lobes developed as an additional erogenous zone to facilitate the extended sexuality necessary in the evolution of human monogamous pair bonding. Morris further stated that the more rounded shape of human female breasts means they are mainly a sexual signalling device rather than simply for providing milk for infants. \n\nMorris framed many features of human behaviour in the context of evolution at a time when cultural explanations were more orthodox. For example, Morris wrote that the intense human pair bond evolved so that men who were out hunting could trust that their mates back home were not having sex with other men, and suggested the possibility that sparse body hair evolved because the \"nakedness\" helped intensify pair bonding by increasing tactile pleasure. Like many other writers in the late 1960s and 1970s, Morris warned against the \"population explosion\" and overcrowding that might cause terminal damage to heretofore relatively stable social structures that humans had evolved in the long course of their development.\n\nA 1973 film directed by Donald Driver, very loosely based on the book, was made starring Johnny Crawford and Victoria Principal. In 2006, an independent film was made, based loosely on the book, written and directed by Daniel Mellitz, starring Josh Wise, Chelse Swain, Sean Shanks, Amanda MacDonald, Tony LaThanh, Corbin Bernsen. Beyond their scripts being loosely based on his book, Morris was not involved in either movie in any way.\n\n\nCritical response\nIn February 1976, the book was removed from high school library shelves by the board of education of the Island Trees Union Free School District in New York. This case became the subject of a U.S. Supreme Court case in 1982.\n\nThe naked ape is mentioned in the Italian entry for the 2017 Eurovision Song Contest \"Occidentali's Karma\" by Francesco Gabbani, in which most of the lyrics contain philosophical references. A lyricist came up with using it in the song lyrics after reading \"The Naked Ape\" himself. Morris, \"fascinated by the culture, beauty and richness\" of the references to his theories, sent Gabbani a signed copy of the Italian translation of the book as a sign of gratitude and support for the latter.Terence McKenna referenced Morris and \"The Naked Ape\" in his lecture \"Culture is Your Operating System\".\n\n\nNotes\nReferences\n"}

The treaty, signed to combat illegal trade of cultural items, was signed 14 November 1970, and came under effect on 24 April 1972. As of September 2018, 137 states have ratified the treaty.\n\nBefore the 1970 UNESCO convention, the illegal trade of antique objects and cultural items was prevalent among the trade of drugs and weapons. Therefore, several sovereign states set about to preserve important historical and culturally significant objects. These actions were a prelude to UNESCO's wide-scale attempt on the manners of preserving cultural objects.\n\nThe conception of the treaty began in April 1964, when UNESCO appointed a Committee of Experts from thirty states in April 1964. In 1968, UNESCO adopted \"Resolution 3.334\", authorizing the creation of a committee to draft a convention. The UNESCO Director-General appointed a principal expert and four consultants to draft the text on the convention, for later review by each member state. Upon its revision, the text was sent to a Special Committee of Governmental Experts, which prepared a final draft around April 1970.\n\nThe convention was attended by 61 states, and then adopted at the 16th General Conference on 14 November 1970.\n\nUnder the 1970 Convention, \"cultural property\" is under protection. Cultural property includes anything of scientific, historical, artistic, and or religiously significant, as defined by Article I of the convention. However, every state can define its own \"cultural property\", as long as it is an item of importance and within the categories defined in Article I.\n\nThe Convention recommends the enforcement of the protection of cultural property in \"three main pillars\", each being \"preventive measures\", \"restitution provisions\", and \"international cooperation\". The first pillar, \"preventive measures\", states that those signed to the treaty are to enforce the security and safety of cultural property, such as taking inventory, exportation certifications, monitoring of trade, and imposition of penal sanctions. The second pillar, \"restitution provisions\", states that each sovereign state is to assist one another in the recuperation of stolen cultural property. The third pillar, \"international cooperation\", is an attempt by the convention to strengthen international ties between signatories, and to provide assistance and cooperation with one another.\n\nFinally, under the convention, any party may seek the recovery and assistance of another state for the recovery of stolen or illegally exported cultural property imported into another state party, albeit only after the enforcement of the Convention in both states. However, the import or export of any cultural property is not legitimized, and can still fall under the terms of the convention.\n\nUnder the Convention, several statutory bodies have been created to oversee the execution of the treaty's goals.\n\nThe Meeting of the States Parties to the 1970 Convention is the sovereign body of the convention. Made up of all the parties that are signed to the 1970 convention, this body organizes strategies and plans of action for the implementation of the convention. They met for the fourth time in May 2017.\n\nThe Subsidiary Committee of the Meeting of States Parties to the 1970 Convention is a statutory body of the 1970 Convention, made of 18 members from the states signed to the convention on 4-year terms, which are controlled by the Meeting of States Parties.\nIts main functions are to not only promote the convention, but to review and inform the Meeting of States Parties, and to identify key problems in the Convention. \n\nThe UNESCO Secretariat of the 1970 Convention assists the Meetings of States Parties by organizing meetings for the Meetings of States Parties and other statutory branches of the convention and assisting in the development of resources and materials regarding the convention.\n\nThe UNESCO Intergovernmental Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to its Countries of Origin or its Restitution in Case of Illicit Appropriation (ICPRCP), or UNESCO Intergovernmental Committee, was created to provide assistance in the recuperation of cultural property. Every two years, half of its 22 members are elected for 4 year terms. As an advisory body, this committee serves the direct assistance in the retrieval of property stolen via illicit trade. It also serves as a possible place for dispute resolution.\n\nThe Intergovermental Committee also manages the International Fund for the Return of Cultural Property to its Countries of Origin or its Restitution in Case of Illicit Appropriation.\n\nUnder UNESCO's request, UNIDROIT drafted the UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally exported Cultural Objects. It serves as a body of private law for the international art trade to assist the efforts of the 1970 convention, which it reinforces with legal rules. It seeks to end technical problems resulting from different laws in different states, and to contribute in the effort against illegal trade of cultural items.\n\nSeveral agencies and organizations have assisted the 1970 Convention, including:\n\n\nThe 1970 Convention consists of two images; a hand superimposed upon a vase. It is meant to represent the end (hand) of the illegal trade of cultural items (vase).\n\n\n"}
