Inspired by the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago, it was designed to demonstrate how far Nordic women had advanced in the areas of education, employment and art. The first of its kind in Europe, it was considered a great success.\n\nThe Chicago World's Fair in 1893 had impressed Danish visitors with its Woman's Building containing presentations of art and literature. Sophie Oxholm (1848–1935), who had visited the exhibition, was obviously impressed by the exhibition, especially the show of Danish needlework. On her return to Denmark, she immediately brought a number of influential women together with a view to arranging a Nordic women's exhibition in Copenhagen the following year. Despite initial enthusiasm, as a result of budgetary and management problems, it was announced in February 1894 that the exhibition would not be held until 1895.\n\nOxholm, who experienced difficulty in managing the arrangements, gave up her position as head of the coordinating committee in early 1895. She was replaced by Bertha Buch of the Women's Society but it was Emma Gad (1852–1921) who proved to be the most effective member. Appointed deputy chair, Gad managed to complete all the arrangements on time. These included selecting the site of the exhibition which was ultimately shared between the Industrial Association building (\"Industriforeningen\"), which had been built in connection with the 1872 Nordic Exhibition, and the premises of Den Frie Udstilling. It was therefore possible for the exhibition to open on 22 June 1895 in the presence of Queen Louise.\n\nIn addition to exhibits from Denmark, the exhibition contained areas specifically dedicated to the Danish provinces and overseas territories (Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland and Danish West Indies) as well as to Norway and Sweden. There are records of the 2,415 exhibits covering painting, curiosities (including items associated with celebrated women), arts and crafts, costumes, jewellery (including gold- and silverware), literature (manuscripts, journals and books) and appliances. There were also separate listings of exhibits relating to housekeeping, philanthropy, hygiene, education, household crafts (spinning and weaving, leather, wood, embroidery, silk painting, and whitework), music and art.\n\nFor the Den Frie Udstilling building, there was a separate inventory of 301 artworks, paintings and sculptures, listed by artist.\n\nThe two women who were instrumental in organizing the exhibition were Sophie Oxholm and, above all, Emma Gad.\n\nThe Women's Exhibition was a great success. Not only was it appreciated in Denmark and beyond, it made a substantial profit. Gad had hoped the money could be used for an independent \"Women's Building\" (\"Kvindernes Bygning\") with a meeting room, reading room, restaurant and accommodation for women from the provinces. Work did not begin on the building until 1929. It was completed in 1937.\n\nWorks by the following artists were included in the Women's Exhibition:\n\n"}

The film screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nDue to the film's portrayal of a lesbian relationship, and the contentiousness of LGBT rights in South Korea, as well as the initial ambiguous relationship of the two main characters, the film had to be financed largely by the Korean Film Council. Because of this, the budget was limited to ; Bae and Kim agreed to not be paid.\n\nFollowing a personal scandal, police academy instructor Lee Young-nam is transferred from Seoul to take office as chief of the police substation in a quiet seaside town in Yeosu. Young-nam keeps a low profile and tolerates the drunken excesses of the locals, but drinks heavily at home, decanting soju into water bottles.\n\nYoung-nam meets Sun Do-hee, a timid and withdrawn 14-year-old girl covered with cuts and bruises. Do-hee is bullied by classmates and beaten by both her drunk stepfather Yong-ha and drunk grandmother; her biological mother abandoned them. The locals keep quiet about Yong-ha's injustices as he is the town's main employer, an oyster farmer.\n\nAfter the body of Yong-ha's mother is found floating in the water, ruled an accidental death caused by drunk driving, Yong-ha attacks Do-hee again. Concerned for Do-hee's safety, Young-nam offers to let her stay with her during the summer vacation, despite scrutiny from the villagers. For the first time, Do-hee has someone who does not hit her and who calls her by her name instead of swearing at her. Do-hee bathes with Young-nam and imitates her, wearing her uniform and cutting her hair in the same style.\n\nYoung-nam is tracked to Yeosu by her ex-girlfriend, who asks her to move to Australia with her. They argue and kiss, and are seen by Yong-ha. When Young-nam discovers that he employs underpaid illegal immigrants, Yong-ha tells the police that Young-nam sexually abused Do-hee. Young-nam is taken into custody. She states she had no improper contact with Do-hee and that taking in an abused child was her duty; the investigator responds that this was inappropriate behavior for a gay woman. Do-hee tells the investigator that Young-nam sexually abused her, and Young-nam is imprisoned. Do-hee is returned to the care of her father and given a number to call if her father beats her again.\n\nAt her family home, Do-hee undresses, dials the number and hides the phone, then caresses her sleeping father. He wakes and begins shouting at her. She cries in protest, telling him \"it hurts\". The police break in and arrest the father. Do-hee tells the investigators that her father told her to lie that Young-nam abused her. Young-nam is released and receives an apology. She visits Do-hee and asks her if she made what happened to her father and grandmother happen on purpose, then leaves. As she is being driven out of town, she tells the officer to stop the car. She finds Do-hee and asks her to come with her.\n\nAt the film's official Cannes screening at the Theatre Debussy, the audience gave it a three-minute standing ovation and it received mostly positive reviews from the media. \"Screen Daily\" called it \"a resolutely left-field and refreshingly off-kilter drama [...] a deftly intriguing tale of alcoholism and abuse that starts off as a seemingly familiar domestic drama before spiralling off into something more unnerving and vaguely disturbing. It is driven by a strong cast and makes the most of it rural location that should be an idyllic but in fact its surface beauty covers up a series of rather dysfunctional people. The film is given heart and soul by a magnetic performance by the excellent Doona Bae.\"\n\n\"Variety\" wrote that the \"wrenching drama\" is a \"layered expose of violence and bigotry in provincial Korean society\" powered by \"mesmerizing\" performances by Bae Doona and Kim Sae-ron. It described Bae's portrayal as \"both towering and frail,\" while \"Kim is electrifying.\" \"Twitch Film\" praised it as \"Korean cinema at its finest,\" \"gripping from start to finish [...] with its fair share of high drama, but unlike most of its Korean compatriots, it never overplays its hand and treats its audience with respect,\" and \"so well-wrought that one can't help but be swept up in its artistry, which effortlessly plunges us into an intellectual reverie.\" \"The Korea Herald\" said it \"deftly blends mystery and thriller,\" \"does an impressive job of tackling modern Korean social issues, including alcoholism, homosexuality, small-town politics, migration and labor,\" and praised \"the three lead actors, especially Bae,\" who \"offer memorable performances as troubled, lonely and searching souls.\"\n\n\"The Hollywood Reporter\" was less impressed: \"While Jung's efforts to avoid sensationalism and employ multiple threads are very admirable, the result is a mild-mannered piece short of a sufficiently substantial exposition of its plethora of characters and the problem they face. All this leads to Bae giving an internalized performance dangerously close to blankness; fortunately, Kim is on hand with a turn that suitably brings to the screen the psychotic state of her battered character.\" \"Film Business Asia\" also singled out Kim as \"the standout performance in a generally impressive first feature by 34-year-old writer-director July Jung, that could have been even better with one more script revision and more animated playing by Bae. Despite that, it's still an involving drama with few dull moments, continually shifting the power balance between the three main protagonists. [...] All of this is a rich concoction that Jung generally brings off. But there are also annoying loose ends that weaken its dramatic impact, [such as] the backgrounds of the three leads are thinly drawn; and the final act has a slightly too manufactured feel. The film could easily lose 10 minutes to its benefit, by shortening or eliminating the repetitive scenes of the girl's beatings.\"\n\n"}

He is best known for his landscapes and scenes inspired by works of literature.\n\nHe was born in Valencia; his father was a watchmaker. Following his parent's wishes, he began studying architecture, but soon switched to painting and enrolled at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Carlos de Valencia. His time there was also short lived, as he soon moved to Rome and led a Bohemian life, becoming largely an autodidact. The rigors of surviving there prompted him to choose to return to Spain.\n\nIn 1862, he displayed his work for the first time at the National Exhibition of Fine Arts with a painting of the Pyrenees, which gained an honorable mention. After that, he became a regular exhibition participant.\n\nIn 1870, his friend Bernardo Ferrándiz Bádenes obtained a commission for him to decorate the ceiling of the Teatro Cervantes in Málaga. He was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Charles III in 1878 for his painting of Queen Isabella giving her jewelry to Columbus. The following year, he became a Professor at the \"Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Telmo\".\n\nHe made a second trip to Rome in 1882, this time on a government fellowship, and remained for two years. Upon his return, he won First Prize at the National Exhibition for his depiction of a scene from the \"Lovers of Teruel\". In 1893, as part of the Columbian Issue, his painting of Isabella was used on a $1 U.S. postage stamp.\n\nFive years later, he replaced Carlos de Haes in the chair of landscape painting at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. He became the Director there in 1901. In 1913, upon his retirement, he donated many of his works to the Academy of San Carlos and the Museu de Belles Arts de València.

{"id": "606818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=606818", "title": "Bardo Thodol", "text": "Bardo Thodol\n\nThe Bardo Thodol (, \"Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State\") is a text from a larger corpus of teachings, the \"Profound Dharma of Self-Liberation through the Intention of the Peaceful and Wrathful Ones\", revealed by Karma Lingpa (1326–1386). It is the best-known work of Nyingma literature, and is known in the West as the Tibetan Book of the Dead.\n\nThe Tibetan text describes, and is intended to guide one through, the experiences that the consciousness has after death, in the bardo, the interval between death and the next rebirth. The text also includes chapters on the signs of death and rituals to undertake when death is closing in or has taken place.\n\n\"Bar do thos grol\" () translates as:\n\n\nAccording to Tibetan tradition, the \"Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State\" was composed in the 8th century by Padmasambhava, written down by his primary student, Yeshe Tsogyal, buried in the Gampo hills in central Tibet and subsequently discovered by a Tibetan terton, Karma Lingpa, in the 14th century.\n\nThe Tibetan title is \"bar do thos grol\", \"Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State\". It consists of two comparatively long texts:\nWithin the texts themselves, the two combined are referred to as \"Liberation through Hearing in the Bardo\", \"Great Liberation through Hearing\", or just \"Liberation through Hearing\".\n\nIt is part of a larger terma cycle, \"Profound Dharma of Self-Liberation through the Intention of the Peaceful and Wrathful Ones\", (\"zab-chos zhi khro dgongs pa rang grol\", also known as \"kar-gling zhi-khro\", popularly known as \"Karma Lingpa's Peaceful and Wrathful Ones.\"\n\nThe \"Profound Dharma of Self-Liberation\" is known in several versions, containing varying numbers of sections and subsections, and arranged in different orders, ranging from around ten to thirty-eight titles. The individual texts cover a wide range of subjects, including meditation instructions, visualizations of deities, liturgies and prayers, lists of mantras, descriptions of the signs of death, indications of future rebirth, and texts such as the \"bar do thos grol\" that are concerned with the bardo-state.\n\nThe \"Bardo Thodol\" differentiates the intermediate state between lives into three bardos: \n\nThe \"Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State\" also mentions three other bardos:\n\nTogether these \"six bardos\" form a classification of states of consciousness into six broad types. Any state of consciousness can form a type of \"intermediate state\", intermediate between other states of consciousness. Indeed, one can consider any momentary state of consciousness a bardo, since it lies between our past and future existences; it provides us with the opportunity to experience reality, which is always present but obscured by the projections and confusions that are due to our previous unskillful actions.\n\nThe \"bar do thos grol\" is known in the west as \"The Tibetan Book of the Dead\", a title popularized by Walter Evans-Wentz's edition, but as such virtually unknown in Tibet. \"The Tibetan Book of the Dead\" was first published in 1927 by Oxford University Press. Dr. Walter Y. Evans-Wentz chose this title because of the parallels he found with the Egyptian Book of the Dead.\n\nAccording to John Myrdhin Reynolds, Evans-Wentz's edition of the \"Tibetan Book of the Dead\" introduced a number of misunderstandings about Dzogchen. In fact, Evans-Wentz' collected seven texts about visualization of the after-death experiences and he introduced this work collection as \"The Tibetan Book of Death.\" Evans-Wentz was well acquainted with Theosophy and used this framework to interpret the translation of \"The Tibetan Book of the Dead\", which was largely provided by two Tibetan lamas who spoke English, Lama Sumdhon Paul and Lama Lobzang Mingnur Dorje. Evans-Wentz was not familiar with Tibetan Buddhism, and his view of Tibetan Buddhism was \"fundamentally neither Tibetan nor Buddhist, but Theosophical and Vedantist.\" He introduced a terminology into the translation which was largely derived from Hinduism, as well as from his Theosophical beliefs. Contrary to the general belief spread in the West by Evans-Wentz, in Tibetan Buddhist practice the Tibetan Book of Dead is not read to the people who are passing away, but it is rather used during life by those who want to learn to visualize what will come after death.\n\nC. G. Jung’s psychological commentary first appeared in an English translation by R. F. C. Hull in the third revised and expanded Evans-Wentz edition of The Tibetan Book of the Dead. The commentary also appears in the Collected Works. Jung applied his extensive knowledge of eastern religion to craft a commentary specifically aimed at a western audience unfamiliar with eastern religious tradition in general and Tibetan Buddhism specifically. He does not attempt to directly correlate the content of the Bardo Thodol with rituals or dogma found in occidental religion, but rather highlights karmic phenomena described on the Bardo plane and shows how they parallel unconscious contents (both personal and collective) encountered in the west, particularly in the context of analytical psychology. Jung’s comments should be taken strictly within the realm of psychology, and not that of theology or metaphysics. Indeed, he warns repeatedly of the dangers for western man in the wholesale adoption of eastern religious traditions such as yoga.\n\n\n\"The Psychedelic Experience\", published in 1964, is a guide for LSD-trips, written by Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner and Richard Alpert, loosely based on Evan-Wentz's translation of the \"Tibetan Book of the Dead\". Aldous Huxley introduced the \"Tibetan Book of the Dead\" to Timothy Leary. According to Leary, Metzner and Alpert, the \"Tibetan Book of the Dead\" is \nThey construed the effect of LSD as a \"stripping away\" of ego-defenses, finding parallels between the stages of death and rebirth in the \"Tibetan Book of the Dead\", and the stages of psychological \"death\" and \"rebirth\" which Leary had identified during his research. \nAccording to Leary, Metzner and Albert it is:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The house had many changes and names until John A. McCaull, a Baltimore lawyer, and Charles E. Ford took charge of it. Considerable money was spent and when they reöpened the house on March 31, 1880, as the Bijou Opera-house, it looked like a modern and well-regulated theatre. In 1881 and 1882, Lillian Russell appeared in three different operettas.\n\nBut the house proved too small to be profitable, so after the performance of July 7, 1883 preparations for tearing it down were at once commenced: R. E. J. Miles and Gen. W. B. Barton leased the premises for five years from its owner, Edward F. James. They agreed to advance sufficient funds to erect a new house, which was designed by J. B. McElfatrick & Son and opened December 1, 1883 as the Bijou Theatre. The first production was \"Orpheus and Eurydice,\" an adaption by Max Freeman of Jacques Offenbach's \"Orfée aux enfers.\"\"\n\n\"Adonis\", starring Henry E. Dixey, played its record-breaking run of 603 performances at the Bijou beginning September 4, 1884. Another long run was \"The Music Master\", starring David Warfield, transferred from the Belasco Theatre on January 9, 1905, and playing 511 performances, for a total at the two theaters of 635, before closing September 29, 1906. The next big hit was \"A Gentleman from Mississippi\", starring Thomas A. Wise and Douglas Fairbanks, which opened September 29, 1908. From June 29 to August 7, 1909, it played at the Aerial Gardens atop the New Amsterdam Theatre, with new scenery and costumes, moving back to the Bijou August 9. After giving its 400th performance (counting the Aerial Gardens) on August 25, the play closed on September 18.\n\nThe Bijou was later used as a silent movie house. It was demolished in 1915 and replaced by the present high-rise office building, which opened in 1917.\n\n\nThe second Bijou Theatre was built by the Shubert family in 1917 at 209 W. 45th Street in New York City. It was one of three theaters that hosted the premiere season of the musical \"Fancy Free\"—but primarily it presented plays by many writers, including Sacha Guitry, John Galsworthy, A. A.

Mankiewicz, Leslie Howard, Anton Chekhov, Henrik Ibsen, Luigi Pirandello, Graham Greene, Eugene O'Neill, William Saroyan, and Seán O'Casey.\n\nIn 1950, as the Bijou, it hosted one film, \"Cyrano de Bergerac\", starring José Ferrer.\n\nIn 1951, it became a CBS radio studio, thenas the D.

The mosque and some other public buildings were constructed in 1465 upon the order of Jahan Shah, the ruler of Kara Koyunlu.\n\nThe mosque was severely damaged in an earthquake in 1780, leaving only the iwan (entrance hall). Reconstruction began in 1973 by Reza Memaran Benam under the supervision of Iranian Ministry of Culture. However, it is still incomplete.\n\nThe Blue mosque of Tabriz was built upon the order of Jahan Shah, the ruler of the Kara Koyunlu. His domain covered major parts of modern Iran, Azerbaijan, and Turkey. Jahan Shah's wife, Khatun Jan Begum (died 1469), estestablished the endowment (\"vaqf\") for the mosque's construction. However, just a few years later, Jahan Shah and his Kara Koyunlu were toppled by Uzun Hassan of the Ak Koyunlu, and Tabriz was taken. Jahan Shah's daughter, Saleha Khatun, was allowed to oversee the rest of the construction work by the new rulers. During the reign of Yaqub bin Uzun Hasan, \"the cupola of the mosque's mausoleum as well as its main parts were completed\". Sandra Aube adds: \"A few details from the mausoleum’s interior, such as alabaster pieces from the wall panels and the main prayer niche (\"meḥrāb\"), reveal that the mausoleum was never completely finished (Golombek and Wilber, p. 407; Aube, p. 248)\". \n\nThough the mausoleum was never completed, when the Safavids assumed control over Tabriz and made it their capital, the Blue Mosque itself served the new rulers as a mosque during the first half of the 16th century. In 1514, after the Safavids were defeated at the decisive Battle of Chaldiran, the Ottomans occupied and looted Tabriz, including the Blue Mosque. Aube notes that at least eight carpets were looted by the Turks and taken to Istanbul. Aube notes that even though it is not known whether the Turks attacked the structure itself during the capture and occupation of the Blue Mosque, several earthquakes did damage the building between the 16th and 18th centuries. It was especially severely damaged by the earthquake of 1780. However, in the 17th century, the Blue Mosque was already reportedly \"completely destroyed and abandoned\". In the 19th century, the local people of Tabriz looted the building's ruins. In the 20th century, during the Pahlavi era, the mosque was finally rebuilt. Reconstruction is performed by plans and supervision of Mohammad Reza Memaran Benam, a traditional architect from Tabriz, with authority of the Iranian Organization of Cultural Heritages.\n\nThe diverse Kufic, and Thuluth scripts, the arabesque patterns, and the choramatic compositions of these facades, were created by Nematollah-ben-Mohammad-ol-Bavab, the famous calligrapher. The walls inside and outside had been covered with mosaic tiles.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "770156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=770156", "title": "But I'm a Cheerleader", "text": "But I'm a Cheerleader\n\nBut I'm a Cheerleader is a 1999 American satirical romantic comedy film directed by Jamie Babbit and written by Brian Wayne Peterson. Natasha Lyonne stars as Megan Bloomfield, a high school cheerleader whose parents send her to a residential inpatient conversion therapy camp to cure her lesbianism. There Megan soon comes to embrace her sexual orientation, despite the therapy, and falls in love. The supporting cast includes Melanie Lynskey, Dante Basco, Eddie Cibrian, Clea DuVall, Cathy Moriarty, Katrina Phillips, RuPaul, Richard Moll, Mink Stole, Kip Pardue, Michelle Williams, and Bud Cort.\n\n\"But I'm a Cheerleader\" was Babbit's first feature film. It was inspired by an article about conversion therapy and her childhood familiarity with rehabilitation programs. She used the story of a young woman finding her sexual identity to explore the social construction of gender roles and heteronormativity. The costume and set design of the film highlighted these themes using artificial textures in intense blues and pinks.\n\nWhen it was initially rated as NC-17 by the MPAA, Babbit made cuts to allow it to be re-rated as R. When interviewed in the documentary film \"This Film Is Not Yet Rated\" Babbit criticized the MPAA for discriminating against films with gay content.\n\nMany critics did not like the film, comparing it unfavorably with the films of John Waters and criticizing the colorful production design. Although the lead actors were praised for their performances, some of the characters were described as stereotypical.\n\nSeventeen-year-old Megan (Natasha Lyonne) is a sunny high school senior who loves cheerleading and is dating a football player, Jared (Brandt Wille). She does not enjoy kissing Jared, however, and prefers looking at her fellow cheerleaders. Combined with Megan's interest in vegetarianism and Melissa Etheridge, her family and friends suspect that she is in fact a lesbian. With the help of ex-gay Mike (RuPaul), they surprise her with an intervention. Following this confrontation, Megan is sent to True Directions, a reparative therapy camp which uses a five-step program (similar to Alcoholics Anonymous' twelve-step program) to convert its campers to heterosexuality.\n\nAt True Directions, Megan meets the founder, strict disciplinarian Mary Brown (Cathy Moriarty), Mary's supposedly heterosexual son Rock (Eddie Cibrian), and a group of young people trying to \"cure\" themselves of their homosexuality. With the prompting of Mary and the other campers, Megan reluctantly agrees that she is a lesbian (step 1 of the five-step program). This fact, at odds with her traditional, religious upbringing, distresses her and she puts every effort into becoming heterosexual. Early on in her stay at True Directions, Megan discovers two of the boys, Dolph and Clayton (Dante Basco and Kip Pardue), making out. She panics and screams, leading to their discovery by Mike. Dolph is made to leave and Clayton is punished by being forced into isolation.\n\nThe True Directions program involves the campers admitting their homosexuality (step 1), rediscovering their gender identity by performing stereotypically gender-associated tasks (step 2), finding the root of their homosexuality through family therapy (step 3), demystifying the other sex (step 4), and simulating heterosexual intercourse (step 5). Over the course of the program, Megan becomes friends with another girl at the camp, Graham (Clea DuVall) who, though more comfortable being gay than Megan, was forced to the camp at the risk of otherwise being disowned by her family.\n\nThe True Directions kids are encouraged to rebel against Mary by two of her former students, ex-ex-gays Larry and Lloyd (Richard Moll and Wesley Mann), who take the campers to a local gay bar where Graham and Megan's relationship develops into a romance. When Mary discovers the trip, she makes them all picket Larry and Lloyd's house, carrying placards and shouting homophobic abuse. Megan and Graham sneak away one night to have sex and begin to fall in love. When Mary finds out, Megan, now at ease with her sexual identity, is unrepentant. She is made to leave True Directions and, now homeless, goes to stay with Larry and Lloyd. Graham, afraid to defy her father, remains at the camp. Megan and Dolph, who is also living with Larry and Lloyd, plan to win back Graham and Clayton.\n\nMegan and Dolph infiltrate the True Directions graduation ceremony where Dolph easily coaxes Clayton away. Megan entreats Graham to join them as well, but Graham nervously declines. Megan then performs a cheer for Graham and tells her that she loves her, finally winning Graham over. They drive off with Dolph and Clayton. The final scene of the film shows Megan's parents (Mink Stole and Bud Cort) attending a PFLAG meeting to come to terms with their daughter's homosexuality.\n\n\"But I'm a Cheerleader\" was Babbit's first feature film. She had previously directed two short films, \"Frog Crossing\" (1996) and \"Sleeping Beauties\" (1999), both of which were shown at the Sundance Film Festival. She went on to direct the 2005 thriller \"The Quiet\" and the 2007 comedy \"Itty Bitty Titty Committee\". Babbit and Sperling (as producer) secured financing from Michael Burns, then the vice president of Prudential Insurance (now Vice Chairman of Lions Gate Entertainment) after showing him the script at Sundance. According to Babbit, their one-sentence pitch was \"Two high-school girls fall in love at a reparative therapy camp.\" Burns gave them an initial budget of US$500,000 which was increased to US$1 million when the film went into production.\n\nBabbit, whose mother runs a halfway house called New Directions for young people with drug and alcohol problems, had wanted to make a comedy about rehabilitation and the 12-step program. After reading an article about a man who had returned from a reparative therapy camp hating himself, she decided to combine the two ideas. With girlfriend Andrea Sperling, she came up with the idea for a feature film about a cheerleader who attends a reparative therapy camp. They wanted the main character to be a cheerleader because it is \"... the pinnacle of the American dream, and the American dream of femininity.\" Babbit wanted the film to represent the lesbian experience from the femme perspective to contrast with several films of the time that represented the butch perspective (for example, \"Go Fish\" and \"The Watermelon Woman\"). She also wanted to satirize both the religious right and the gay community.\nNot feeling qualified to write the script herself, Babbit brought in screenwriter and recent graduate of USC School of Cinematic Arts Brian Wayne Peterson. Peterson had experience with reparative therapy while working at a prison clinic for sex offenders. He has said that he wanted to make a film that would not only entertain people, but also make people get angry and talk about the issues it raised.\n\nBabbit says that her influences for the look and feel of the film included John Waters, David LaChapelle, \"Edward Scissorhands\" and Barbie.\nShe wanted the production and costume design to reflect the themes of the story. There is a progression from the organic world of Megan's hometown, where the dominant colors are orange and brown, to the fake world of True Directions, dominated by intense blues and pinks (which are intended to show the artificiality of gender construction). According to Babbit, the germaphobic character of Mary Brown represents AIDS paranoia and her clean, ordered world is filled with plastic flowers, fake sky and PVC outfits. The external shots of the colorful house complete with a bright pink picket fence were filmed in Palmdale, California.\n\nBabbit recruited Clea DuVall, who had starred in her short film \"Sleeping Beauties\", to play the role of Graham Eaton. Babbit says that she was able to get a lot of the cast through DuVall, including Natasha Lyonne and Melanie Lynskey. Lyonne first saw the script in the back of DuVall's car and subsequently contacted her agent about it. She had seen and enjoyed Babbit's short \"Sleeping Beauties\" and was eager to work with the director. She was not the first choice for the role of Megan. An unnamed actress wanted to play the part but eventually turned it down because of religious beliefs; she did not want her family to see her face on the poster. Babbit briefly considered Rosario Dawson as Megan but her executive producer persuaded her that Dawson, who is Hispanic, would not be right for the All-American character.\n\nBabbit made a conscious effort to cast people of color for minor roles, in an effort to combat what she describes as \"racism at every level of making movies.\" From the beginning she intended the characters of Mike (played by RuPaul), Dolph (Dante Basco) and Andre (Douglas Spain) to be African American, Asian and Hispanic, respectively. She initially considered Arsenio Hall for the character of Mike but says that Hall was uncomfortable about playing a gay-themed role. As Mike, RuPaul makes a rare film appearance out of drag.\n\n\"But I'm a Cheerleader\" is not only about sexuality, but also gender and the social construction of gender roles. One of the ways in which Babbit highlighted what she called the artificiality of gender construction was by using intense blues and pinks in her production and costume design. Chris Holmlund in \"Contemporary American Independent Film\" notes this feature of the film and calls the costumes \"gender-tuned.\" Ted Gideonse in \"Out\" magazine wrote that the costumes and colors of the film show how false the goals of True Directions are.\n\nGender roles are further reinforced by the tasks the campers have to perform in \"Step 2: Rediscovering Your Gender Identity.\" Nikki Sullivan in \"A Critical Introduction to Queer Theory\" says that this rediscovery is shown to be difficult and unsuccessful rather than the natural discovery of their latent heterosexuality. Sullivan says that the film not only highlights the ways in which gender and sexuality are constructed but also takes the norms and truths about heteronormative society and renders them strange or \"queer.\" Holmlund says that Babbit makes the straight characters less normal and less likable than the gay ones. Sullivan says that this challenge of heteronormativity makes \"But I'm a Cheerleader\" an exemplification of queer theory.\n\nWhen originally submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America rating board, \"But I'm a Cheerleader\" received an NC-17 rating. In order to get a commercially viable R rating, Babbit removed a two-second shot of Graham's hand sweeping Megan's clothed body, a camera pan up Megan's body when she is masturbating, and a comment that Megan \"ate Graham out\" (slang for cunnilingus). Babbit was interviewed by Kirby Dick for his 2006 documentary film \"This Film Is Not Yet Rated\". A critique of the MPAA's rating system, it suggests that films with homosexual content are treated more stringently than those with only heterosexual content, and that scenes of female sexuality draw harsher criticism from the board than those of male sexuality. It compares this movie to \"American Pie\" (also released in 1999), which features a teenage boy masturbating and was given an R rating (though \"American Pie\" also originally received an NC-17 rating and also required cuts to its masturbation scene to reduce its rating to R). Babbit says that she felt discriminated against for making a gay film. The film was rated as M (for mature audiences) in Australia and in New Zealand, 14A in Canada, 12 in Germany and 15 in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe film premiered on September 12, 1999 at the Toronto International Film Festival and was shown in January 2000 at the Sundance Film Festival. It went on to play at several international film festivals including the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras festival and the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival. It first appeared in U.S. theaters on July 7, 2000, distributed by Lions Gate Entertainment. Fine Line Features had intended to distribute the film but dropped it two months before it was due to open following a dispute with the film's production company, Ignite Entertainment. It closed after 8 weeks, with its widest release having been 115 theaters.\n\nThe film was released on Region 1 DVD by Lions Gate on July 22, 2002 and by Universal Studios on October 3, 2002. Other than the theatrical trailer, it contains no extras. It was released on Region 2 DVD on June 2, 2003 by Prism Leisure. In addition to the trailer, it features an interview with Jamie Babbit and behind the scenes footage.\n\n\"But I'm a Cheerleader\" grossed $2,205,627 in the United States and $389,589 elsewhere, giving a total of $2,595,216 worldwide. In its opening weekend, showing at four theaters, it earned $60,410 which was 2.7% of its total gross. According to Box Office Mojo, it ranked at 174 for all films released in the US in 2000 and 74 for R-rated films released that year. , its all time box-office ranking for LGBT-related films is 73.\n\nThe film was a hit with festival audiences and received standing ovations at the San Francisco International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival. It has been described as a favorite with gay audiences and on the art house circuit.\n\nInitial mainstream critical response to \"But I'm a Cheerleader\" was mostly negative. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a score of 34% based on 47 reviews, and Metacritic gave it a score of 39% based on 30 reviews. The overall theme of reviews is that it is a heartfelt film with good intentions, but that it is flawed. Some reviewers found it funny and enjoyable with \"genuine laughs\", however. Roger Ebert rated it three stars (of four) and wrote, it \"is not a great, breakout comedy, but more the kind of movie that might eventually become a regular on the midnight cult circuit.\" Others found it obvious, leaden, and heavy handed.\n\nWriting for \"The New York Times\", Elvis Mitchell described the character of Megan as a sweet heroine and Lyonne and DuVall were praised for their performances. Mick LaSalle called Lyonne wonderful and said that she was well matched by DuVall. Marjorie Baumgarten said that they \"hit the right notes.\" Alexandra Mendenhall, writing for AfterEllen.com felt that the relationship between Graham and Megan, having great chemistry, does not get enough screen time. Mitchell called their love scenes \"tender.\"\nOther characters, particularly the males, were described as \"offputting\" and \"nothing but stereotypes.\"\n\nSeveral reviewers compared the film to those of director John Waters but felt that it fell short of the mark. Stephanie Zacharek called it a \"Waters knockoff\" while Ebert said that Waters might have been ruder and more polished. Babbit says that although Waters is one of her influences, she did not want her film to have the \"bite\" of his. She states that whereas John Waters does not like romantic comedies, she wanted to tell a conventionally romantic story. The production design, which was important to the overall look and feel of the film, drew mixed responses. LaSalle described it as clever and eyecatching and James Berardinelli called it a standout feature. Others found it to be gaudy, dated, cartoonish and ghastly.\n\nStephanie Zacharek, writing for Salon.com said that with regard to issues of sexual orientation and homophobia, Babbit is preaching to the converted. Cynthia Fuchs, for NitrateOnline.com, agreed, stating that \"no one who is phobic might recognize himself in the film\" and that \"the audience who might benefit most from watching it either won't see the film or won't see the point.\" David Edelstein said that the one sidedness of the film creates a lack of dramatic tension and calls it lazy counterpropaganda. In contrast, LaSalle said that \"the picture manages to make a heartfelt statement about the difficulties of growing up gay\" and Timothy Shary said that the film openly challenges homophobia and offers support to teenaged gay viewers. Chris Holmlund said that the film shows that queer identity is multi-faceted, using as an example the scene where the ex-ex-gays tell Megan that there is no one way to be a lesbian.\n\nReviews from the gay media were more positive, and the film has undergone a critical reassessment over time as it has been understood more to have been deliberately satirical and campy, drawing on John Waters' techniques. Feminist website Autostraddle declared the film to be #1 of 100 best lesbian movies of all time in 2015. AfterEllen.com (which covers the feminist \"lesbian/bi pop culture beat\") has called it \"one of the five best lesbian movies ever made.\" That site had originally called the movie's story predictable and the characters stereotypical in its initial 2007 review, with the reviewer saying the film was, overall, funny and enjoyable. \"Curve\" called the film an \"incredible comedy\" and said that Babbit has \"redefined lesbian film\" with this movie and her other work. Praise was not universal, however. Jan Stuart, writing for \"The Advocate\", said that although the film tries to subvert gay stereotypes, it is unsuccessful. She called it \"numbingly crude\" and said that the kitsch portrait of Middle America is out of touch with today's gay teenagers.\n\nThe film won the Audience Award and the Graine de Cinéphage Award at the 2000 Créteil International Women's Film Festival, an annual French festival which showcases the work of female directors. Also that year it was nominated by the Political Film Society of America for the PFS award in the categories of Human Rights and Exposé, but lost out to \"Remember the Titans\" and \"Before Night Falls\", respectively.\n\nPat Irwin composed the score for \"But I'm a Cheerleader\". The soundtrack has never been released on CD. Artists featured include indie acts Saint Etienne, Dressy Bessy and April March. RuPaul contributed one track, \"Party Train,\" which Eddie Cibrian's character, Rock, is shown dancing to.\n\n\nIn 2005 the New York Musical Theatre Festival featured a musical stage adaptation of \"But I'm a Cheerleader\" written by librettist and lyricist Bill Augustin and composer Andrew Abrams. With 18 original songs, it was directed by Daniel Goldstein and starred Chandra Lee Schwartz as Megan. It played during September 2005 at New York's Theatre at St. Clement's.\n\n\nNotes\n\nFootnotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

{"id": "271622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=271622", "title": "Conversations with God", "text": "Conversations with God\n\nConversations with God (CwG) is a sequence of books written by Neale Donald Walsch. It was written as a dialogue in which Walsch asks questions and God answers. The first book of the \"Conversations with God\" series, \"Conversations with God, Book 1: An Uncommon Dialogue\", was published in 1995 and became a publishing phenomenon, staying on \"The New York Times Best Sellers List\" for 137 weeks. The succeeding volumes in the nine book series also appeared prominently on the List.\n\nIn an interview with Larry King, Walsch described the inception of the books as follows: at a low period in his life, Walsch wrote an angry letter to God asking questions about why his life wasn't working. After writing down all of his questions, he heard a voice over his right shoulder say: \"Do you really want an answer to all these questions or are you just venting?\" Though when he turned around he saw no one there, Walsch felt answers to his questions filling his mind and decided to write them down. The ensuing dialogue became the \"Conversations with God\" books. When asked in a recent interview how does he ‘open up’ to God these days, Neale stated “I am reaching out to touch others with this information. When I reach out and touch others with this information I reconnect immediately with the divine presence.”\n\nContaining nearly 3,000 pages of material in total, the series presents a large number of ideas. The second and third books in the original trilogy deal with political and social issues.\n\nIn \"Friendship with God\", Walsch writes that God presents four concepts which are central to the entire dialogue:\n\n\nExistence is essentially non-dual in nature. At the highest level there is no separation between anything and there is only one of us; there is only God, and everything is God. The second statement, following from the first, means that we, in this seeming existence, lack nothing and if we choose to realize it, we have enough of whatever we think we need (or the means to create it) within us. The third statement combines the first two to conclude that God, being all there is and is thus always sufficient unto Itself, has no need of anything and therefore has no requirements of humanity. The final concept puts an end to our need to always be right. Given that we have and are everything, and there's nothing we \"have\" to do, there are an \"infinite\" number of ways to experience this, not just the \"one\" way we may have chosen so far.\n\nAccording to the books, God recommends many economic and social changes if people want to make a more functional, adaptable, and sustainable world, it recommends that more attention should focus on the environment. The conversations also speak of reincarnation and the existence of life on other planets.\n\nIn Walsch's first dialogue, God notes that \"knowing\" and \"experiencing\" oneself are different things. Before creation, there was only That-Which-Is, which cannot know or experience itself fully, without something it is not. It cannot know itself as love, since nothing exists but love. It cannot know itself as giving since nothing else exists to give to. It cannot experience itself in myriad ways because everything is one.\n\nThis present creation then, in Walsch's viewpoint, is established by and within God, so that sentience can exist which does not directly remember its true nature as God. Split into infinite forms, all life can live, experience, and recreate its nature as God, rather than just \"know\" itself as the creator in theory. It is essentially a game, entered into by agreement, to remember who and what we are and enjoy and create, knowing that ultimately there is no finish line that some will not reach, no understanding that is not without value, no act that does not add meaning to the future or for others. Walsch claims that God says that we have a common interest in keeping the game going, for there is nothing else to do except to experience our existence and then experience more of it, to uncover deeper layers of truth and understanding. There are no external rules, because all experience is subjective, and is chosen. But within this, there are ways that (it is stated and implied) people will gradually come to see their thoughts, words, actions are either working or they are not working. A thing is either functional or dysfunctional, not right or wrong. These rememberings take place over \"time\" and can take hundreds and thousands of lifetimes.\n\nBook 1 (page 4) argues that words are not the ultimate truth, rather words are symbols, and are open to interpretations. Thus the readers are advised to consult their own inner knowing or intuition to determine their own truth while reading the book, or any other book. Though the books bear the title \"Conversations with God\" and the author states in book 1 that he is \"taking dictation\" from God, the 'dialogue' is said to be between God and all people at all times. The question, according to Neale, is not to whom does God talk, but who listens. This is clarified by the statement that God can communicate with people in many ways (the next song you hear, the next sunset you experience, the next time you hear laughter, the next movie that really moves you), and not necessarily through words 'spoken' by God to a person. \"All these devices are mine. All these avenues are open to me. I will speak to you if you invite me.\" (CwG1, page 58). Jesus is said to have sought to lead by example, which is why he said, \"I am the way and the life, follow me\". Follow me meant that we should follow his example and become one with God - Jesus and other living things are/were not one with God presently (everything is happening right now with no space/time difference) - rather than become his followers. Jesus is supposed to have said, \"I and the Father (God) are one and you are my brethren\". This means that living things are all one (particles of the collective God) (Book 3, Chapter20, pgs. 329-330). Jesus is said to have said, \"without the father (God), I am nothing\". The father of all is pure thought which is the energy of life (Book 3, Chapter11, pg. 180). In Book 3 of \"Conversations with God\" (1998), by Neale Donald Walsch, it is mentioned that Mahavatar Babaji may at one time have resurrected himself from the dead, just like Lazarus, Jesus and other humans. When Neil asks God if reincarnation is a false doctrine, God replies that it is not. Neale then asks why some religions do not know the truth about something so basic. In response, God says that we must understand that humans have many fear based religions whose teachings surround the doctrine of a God who is to be worshipped and feared. It was through fear that the entire Earth society reformed itself from a matriarchy into a patriarchy. It was through fear that the holy priests got people to mend their wicked ways and heed the word of the Lord. It was through fear that the churches gained and controlled their membership. Churches even insisted that God will punish you if you did not go to church every Sunday, not going to church was declared a sin - and not just any church. One had to attend one particular church - if you went to a church of a different denomination that too was a sin. That was an attempt at control, pure and simple, using fear. The amazing thing is it worked. People will always believe in hell and in a God who would send them there as long as we believe that God is like man — ruthless, self-serving, unforgiving and vengeful. In the past, most people could not imagine a God who might rise above all of that so they accepted the teachings of many churches to fear the terrible vengeance of the Lord. It was as if people could not trust themselves to be good and act appropriately, on their own by their own built in reasons. So they had to create a religion that taught the doctrine of an angry, retributive God in order to keep themselves in line. The idea of reincarnation threw a monkey wrench into all of that. The church was proclaiming that you better be nice or else—and along came the reincarnationists saying you have another chance after this and another chance after that and still more chances, so don't worry. Do the best you can. Don't become so paralysed with fear that you can't budge. Promise yourself to do better and get on with it. Naturally, the early Church couldn't hear of such a thing that did two things. First, it denounced the doctrine of reincarnation as heretical, then it created the sacrament of confession. Confession could do for the Church goer what reincarnation promised. That is, give him another chance. There was a catch however - this absolution could not come directly from God, it had to flow through the church whose priests pronounced penances which had to be performed. These were usually prayers which were required of the sinner. So now you had two reasons to keep up church membership. The church found confession to be such a good drawing card that soon it declared to be a sin not to go to confession. Everybody had to do it at least once a year. If they didn't, God would have another reason to be angry. More and more rules - many of them arbitrary and capricious - began to be promulgated by the church, each rule having the power of God's eternal condemnation behind it, unless, of course, failure was confessed and then the person was forgiven by God and condemnation avoided. That lead to another problem. People figured out that this must mean they could do anything as long as they confessed it. The church was in a quandary. Fear had left the hearts of the people. Church attendance and membership dropped. People came to confess once a year, said their penances, were absolved of their sins and went on with their lives. There was no question about it. A way had to be found to strike fear into the heart again, so purgatory was invented. Purgatory was described as a place something like hell, but not eternal. This new doctrine declared that God would make you suffer for your sins even if you confessed them. Under the doctrine, a certain amount of suffering was decreed by God for each nonperfect soul, based on the number and type of sins committed. There were mortal sins and venial sins. Mortal sins would send you right to hell if not confessed before death. Once more, Church attendance shot up, collections were up, too and especially contributions—for the doctrine of purgatory could buy one's way out of the suffering. According to the church's teaching, one could receive a special indulgence but not directly from God - only from an official of the church. These special indulgences freed one from the suffering in purgatory which they had earned with their sins or at least part of it. These reprieves were granted to very few like those who made a huge contribution to the church. For a really huge sum, one could obtain a plenary indulgence. This meant no time in purgatory at all - it was a non-stop ticket straight to heaven. This special favor from God was available for even fewer. Royalty, perhaps and the super rich. The amount of money, jewels and land given to the church in exchange for these plenary indulgences was enormous. The exclusivity of this brought great frustration and resentment to the masses. The poorest peasant had no hope of gaining a bishop's indulgence and so the rank and file lost faith in the system with attendance threatening to drop once again. Then they brought in the novena candles. People could come to the church and light a novena candle for the poor souls in purgatory and by saying a novena (a series of prayers in a particular order that took some time to complete), they could reduce by many years the sentence of the dearly departed, extricating them from purgatory sooner than God would otherwise have allowed. They couldn't do anything for themselves but at least they could pray for mercy for the departed. Of course, it would be helpful if a coin or two were dropped through the slot for each candle lit. A lot of little candles were flickering behind a lot of red glass and a lot of pesos and pennies were being dropped into a lot of tin boxes in an attempt to get God to ease up on the suffering being inflicted on the souls in purgatory (Book 3, Chapter7, pgs. 126-130).\n\nIn the dialogue many philosophical ideas are presented that had already been advanced earlier by major Eastern and Western thinkers, but Walsch presents the information in language for modern readers and does not specifically cite any of these philosophers. In fact, Walsch claims that he had never known most of these ideas before his revelatory experiences. Since the beginning of the series, and especially in the latter volumes, Walsch and \"God\" acknowledge that most of the concepts presented are previously known to humanity, but are profound enough to warrant being explored repeatedly, and put into this cohesive unified form. Since humanity is still mired in strife and conflict, there is value in their restatement. Fundamental parts of Walsch's writings are also mirrored within other well known spiritual writings and traditions:\n\n\nThe following are the ten books in the \"Conversations With God\" Dialogue Books series. Each of these books is a claimed transcript of dialogue between two beings, Neale Donald Walsch and \"God\", with the exception of \"Communion with God\", which is written only by \"God\".\n\n\n\"Home With God\", we are told, is the final book in this series of two-way written communication {see HwG page 308, \"Our final conversation in public.\"}. In August 2016, however, Neale stumbled upon a \"new and unexpected dialogue\" continuing the original trilogy with a fourth installment released on March 27, 2017.\n\nThe first three books in the series are often called the CwG trilogy. In 2005, the trilogy was re-released as one combined 'Gift Edition' book. This edition contains the entire text of the first three books with 'God's words in blue ink and Neale's in black ink, and features a combined 3-in-1 index at the back.\n\n\n\nPlease see the Writings at Neale Donald Walsch.\n\nA \"Conversations with God\" movie shows the author's experience opened in theatres across the United States on October 27, 2006. Walsch is played by Henry Czerny in the film directed by Stephen Deutsch.\n\nConversations with God books 1 and 2, and Communion with God, narrated by Ed Asner. \nThe DVD version of the film was released on February 27, 2007.\n\n"}
{"id": "13258353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13258353", "title": "Cosmographia (Bernardus Silvestris)", "text": "Cosmographia (Bernardus Silvestris)\n\nCosmographia (\"Cosmography\"), also known as De mundi universitate (\"On the totality of the world\"), is a Latin philosophical allegory, dealing with the creation of the universe, by the twelfth-century author Bernardus Silvestris. In form, it is a \"prosimetrum\", in which passages of prose alternate with verse passages in various classical meters. The philosophical basis of the work is the Platonism of contemporary philosophers associated with the cathedral school of Chartres—one of whom, Thierry of Chartres, is the dedicatee of the work. According to a marginal note in one early manuscript, the \"Cosmographia\" was recited before Pope Eugene III when he was traveling in France (1147–48).\n\nThe work is divided into two parts: \"Megacosmus\", which describes the ordering of the physical universe, and \"Microcosmus\", which describes the creation of man.\n\n1 (verse): Natura (Nature) complains to Noys (Divine Providence; Greek ) that Hyle (Primordial Matter; Greek ), although held in check by Silva (the Latin equivalent of \"hyle\"), is chaotic and unformed and asks that Noys impose order and form on the confused matter.<br>\n2 (prose): Noys reveals her status as the daughter of God and asserts that the time is right for Natura's plea to be granted. She then separates out the four elements of fire, earth, water, and air from primordial matter. Seeing that the results are good, she begets the World Soul, or Endelechia, as a bride for Mundus (World). Their marriage is the source of life in the universe.<br>\n3 (verse): This long poem in elegiac couplets presents the results of the ordering of the universe. Ether, the stars and sky, the earth, and the sea have become distinguished, and the nine orders of angels attend on the God who exists outside the universe. There follows a catalogue of the stars and constellations, along with the planets and their natures. Then the earth and its creatures are described, with catalogues of mountains, beasts, rivers, plants (which are treated in particular detail), fish, and birds.<br>\n4 (prose): The relationships between the powers operating in the universe are analyzed. All things under the heavens form part of a cosmic cycle, controlled by Natura, which will never cease, since its maker and cause are eternal. Hyle is the basis, whom the rational plan of God and Noys has ordered in an everlasting system, although subject to time: \"For as Noys is forever pregnant of the divine will, she in turn informs Endelechia with the images she conceives of the eternal patterns, Endelechia impresses them upon Nature, and Nature imparts to Imarmene [Destiny; Greek ] what the well-being of the universe demands.\"\n\n1 (prose): Noys displays the created universe to Natura and points out its various features.<br>\n2 (verse): With the work of Noys, Silva has recovered her true beauty. Noys (still speaking to Natura) declares herself proud of the harmony she has brought to the universe.<br>\n3 (prose): Noys says that for the completion of the cosmic design, the creation of man is needed. For this it is necessary that Natura seek out Urania (the celestial principle) and Physis (the material principle). Natura sets forth and searches through various regions of the heavens. When she reaches the outermost limit of the heavens, she encounters the Genius whose responsibility it is to delineate the celestial forms on the individual objects of the universe. He greets Natura and points out Urania, whose brightness dazzles Natura.<br>\n4 (verse): Urania agrees to descend to Earth and collaborate in the creation of man. She will take with her the human soul, guiding it through all the heavens so that it may become acquainted with the laws of fate and learn the rules that govern its behavior.<br>\n5 (prose): To gain the sanction of the divine powers, Natura and Urania travel outside the cosmos, to the sanctuary of the supreme divinity, Tugaton (the Good; Greek ), whose favor they pray for. They then descend, one by one, through the planetary spheres.<br>\n6 (verse): Having reached the lower boundary of the sphere of the Moon, where the quintessence meets the terrestrial elements, Natura pauses to look about her.<br>\n7 (prose): Natura and Urania see thousands of spirits. Urania tells Natura that, in addition to the angels who dwell beyond the created universe and in the heavenly spheres, there are spirits below the Moon—some good, some evil.<br>\n8 (verse): Urania bids Natura to review the totality of the universe and note the principles of divine concord that it manifests.<br>\n9 (prose): Natura and Urania descend to Earth and reach a secluded \"locus amoenus\" (called Gramision or Granusion—the readings of the manuscripts are disputed). There they meet Physis, accompanied by her daughters Theorica (Contemplative Knowledge) and Practica (Active Knowledge), who is rapt in contemplation of created life in all its aspects. Suddenly, Noys appears.<br>\n10 (verse): Noys explains that Natura, Urania, and Physis can collaborate to complete the creation by fashioning a creature who participates in both the divine and earthly realms.<br>\n11 (prose): Noys assigns Urania, Physis, and Natura specific tasks in the creation of man, providing a model for each. Urania, using the Mirror of Providence, is to provide him with a soul derived from Endelechia; Physis, using the Book of Memory, is to provide him with a body; and Natura, using the Table of Destiny, is to unite the soul and the body.<br>\n12 (verse): Natura summons her two companions to begin the work. Physis, however, is somewhat angry, since she sees that matter is ill-suited for the fashioning of a being that requires intellect. Urania assists her by eliminating the evil taint from Silva and containing the matter within definite limits.<br>\n13 (prose): Physis—making use of the imperfect aspects of Silva that had (somewhat uncertainly) submitted to the will of God and had been left over from the rest of creation—fashions a body. The four humors are described, along with the tripartite division of the body into the head (seat of the brain and the sensory organs), the breast (seat of the heart) and the loins (seat of the liver).<br>\n14 (verse): The powers of the senses and the brain, heart, and liver are detailed. The organs of generation will prevent human life from wholly passing away and the universe from returning to chaos.\n\nThe ultimate source for much of Bernardus' allegory is the account of creation in Plato's \"Timaeus\", as transmitted in the incomplete Latin translation, with lengthy commentary, by Calcidius. This was the only work of Plato's that was widely known in western Europe during the Middle Ages, and it was central to the renewed interest in natural science among the philosophers associated with the school of Chartres:\n\nChartres … would long remain the fertile soil in which this conception [of man as microcosm] would grow, and this the more as the \"Timaeus\", itself constructed upon the parallelism between microcosm and macrocosm, became a central preoccupation of teaching at Chartres. This was the first age, the golden age, of Platonism as such in the West, an age which found in the \"Timaeus\" an entire physics, an anthropology, a metaphysics, and even a lofty spiritual teaching.\n\nFrom the \"Timaeus\" Bernardus and the Chartrian thinkers, such as Thierry of Chartres and William of Conches, adopted three fundamental assumptions: \"that the visible universe is a unified whole, a 'cosmos'; that it is the copy of an ideal exemplar; and that its creation was the expression of the goodness of its creator\". Thierry had written a \"Tractatus de sex dierum operibus\", in which he had essayed to elucidate the biblical account of creation \"iuxta physicas rationes tantum\" (\"purely in terms of physical causes\"); and this perhaps accounts for Bernardus' dedication of the \"Cosmographia\" to Thierry.\n\nAlong with the \"Timaeus\" and Calcidius' commentary, Bernardus' work also draws on Platonic themes diffused throughout a variety of works of late antiquity, such as Apuleius' philosophical treatises, Macrobius' commentary on Cicero's \"Dream of Scipio\", the Hermetic \"Asclepius\", the \"De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii\" of Martianus Capella, and Boethius' \"Consolation of Philosophy\". In addition to their Platonic elements, the latter two works would have provided models of the \"prosimetrum\" form; and Macrobius' commentary had authorized the use of allegorical (\"fabulosa\") methods in philosophers' treatment of certain subjects, since \"sciunt inimicam esse naturae apertam nudamque expositionem sui\" (\"they realize that a frank, open exposition of herself is distasteful to Nature\").\n\nThat the \"Cosmographia\" survives, in whole or in part, in about fifty manuscripts indicates that it enjoyed a good deal of popularity in the Middle Ages. Scholars have traced its influence on \"a wide variety of medieval and renaissance authors, including Hildegard of Bingen, Vincent of Beauvais, Dante, Chaucer, Nicholas of Cusa, and Boccaccio—whose annotated copy of the work we possess\". In particular, Bernardus' conceptions of Natura and Genius would be echoed and transformed in the works of Alain de Lille, in the \"Roman de la Rose\", in Chaucer's \"Parlement of Foules\", and in Gower's \"Confessio Amantis\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

There they founded several principalities: Pannonian Croatia in the north around the river Sava, and Dalmatian Croatia along the western and southern Adriatic coast. Together they were known as White Croatia, while to the east there were medieval principalities in southern Dalmatia which were at times collectively called Red Croatia.\n\nCroats have been developed to the stage of Iron Age, and they didn’t know how to enjoy the riches of Roman cities, so they inhabited not the city itself but its suburbs (like the river island on the delta of river Jadro next to city of Salona). Croats have assimilated Avars, accepted Christianity, and the ruling cast learned to speak and write Latin. Croats have accepted Christianity from Franks to the west and from Byzantium from the east. Most of the principalities have turned to Christianity in the 9th century except Pagania which was true to old Slav mythology until the 13th century.\nFirst Croatian ruler that was recognized by the pope was duke Branimir, who was called by pope John VIII \"dux Chroatorum\" in his letter in 879.\nFirst king of Kingdom of Croatia, Tomislav from the House of Trpimirović was crowned around year 925 as \"rex Chroatorum\" and he united Pannonian Principality and Littoral Croatian Duchy into respectable medieval country which peaked during the reign of Petar Krešimir IV (1058-1074).\n\nDuring the time of Croatian rulers the country was rarely ruled from one place and royal court would move from town to town in which there was a royal castle. The most important royal cities were Nin, Biograd na Moru and Knin. Other bigger cities were Zadar, Split, Krk, Osor, Trogir, Ston and Dubrovnik, in which big number of original Roman population resided that was eventually croaticized.\n\nAfter the death of last ruler from the dynasty of Trpimirović in 1091 most of Croatian nobility has accepted the Hungarian king Coloman as a king of unified kingdom of Croatian and Hungary, stated by the deal \"Pacta Conventa\" from year 1102. In Hungarian Kingdom, in Croatia all art already has all characteristics of Romanesque style.\n\nDuring 7th and 8th century in Croatia there is a trend of building smaller buildings from the material and decorative elements of ruined older Roman buildings. During the 9th century, parallel with the establishment of Croatian principalities, new architecture of pre-Romanesque characteristics emerged. It was based on numerous influences of which the Frankish and Byzantine were the strongest. Slowly these inherited influences were degrading in favour of original architectural forms.\nFrom this time, there are dozens of large ones and over a hundred small churches preserved across entire Croatian coastline and islands. They are all built out of roughly broken stones covered with thick layer of moulter inside and out, and with narrow decorative niches with arched top (like church of st. Peter in Priko near Omiš and St. Michael near Ston). Also, they often have stone vaults, apses and domes, as well as stone furniture (frames of doors and windows, perforated stone windows, and altar fences) columns, beams and portals. Instead of classical Roman forms where every part of the building was articulated and had its own recognizable form, new pre-Romanesque buildings have those parts united in unified mass. Therefore, the point where the wall turns to vault, or to drum of the dome is almost unnoticeable. Even though they were built roughly with unsophisticated materials they have excellent and often perfect understanding of architectural space.\nSmaller churches are called “churches of free shapes” as which the medieval architects wanted to explore all possibilities of shaping on the circular and rectangular base. Cube churches with dome are a bit simple (St. Pelegrin, Dugi otok), rectangular with elliptical base are a bit more complex (St. George, Ravanjska), as well as single nave churches with dome above middle section (St. Peter in Omiš) and cube based churches elongated with two apses (Church of St. Donatus on Krk) and the most complicated ones are those based on Greek cross with dome on the centre and large apse in eastern wing and two smaller apses in northern and southern wing (Church of Saint Cross in Nin).\n\nThe most original churches are churches based on a circle with multiple apses that are spread around in radial rhythm. Church of St. Three in Split has radial 6 apses, while Church in Ošlje (Ston) is the ony one with 8 apses. The biggest church with circular base is \"Church of St. Donatus\" in Zadar from the 9th century. Around its circular base that has a dome there is a ring nave with gallery and three apses on the east. From that time in central Europe there is only Charlemagne’s \"Palatine Chapel in Aachen\" that can be compared with its size and beauty.\n\nLarge churches often have one or three naves, like \"St. Saviour, Cetina\" from the 9th century which has rounded buttresses and a bell tower above the western portal (westwork).\n\nIn the 10th century Croatian queen Jelena of Zadar, the wife of king Mihajlo Krešimir II, built in Solin two churches: Church of St. Stephen of the Island which was used as a royal mausoleum, and Church of Our Lady of the Island, one of the biggest in Croatia which was used as crown basilica. Church of St. Stephen was built in Carolingian style with entrance hall above which was a gallery surrounded with two towers (westwork) from each sides of a narthex which led to tree nave church with two rows of pillars and a square apse at the end of central nave.\n\nIn the 11th century, next to older “Church on the Hill” in Solin, Crown church of St. Peter and Moses (better known as “Hollow church“) was built. The church was of unified Croatian pre-Romanesque forms and those Romanesque that appeared with the arrival of Benedictine monks in these parts. It has three naves, many thin niches inside and three apses of which middle is square and other are semicircular from inside and square outside. In this church the legate of Pope Gregory VII has crowned Croatian Dmitar Zvonimir.\n\nIn northern Croatia there are only few fragments of interlace found in Sisak, the capital of Ljudevit Posavski. When the bishopric was founded in Zagreb (1090), Croatian culture at the coast has already flourished for 300 years and Croatia was at the end of its independence.\n\nPre-Romanesque Croatian churches are also the most important historical sources of that time because on their beams and tympanums of altar fences, as well on some portals and ciboriums we found many names of Croatian kings, dukes and nobleman which are mentioned as patrons and builders of those churches. The oldest one is from church in Rižinice (Solin) which mentions Croatian duke Trpimir (\"PRO DVCE TREPIMERO\"), from around year 850, while on the inscription of duke Branimir from year 888 we have the oldest mention of Croats: \"CRVATORVM\". On the rest from 10th century we found the names of dukes Muncimir of Croatia, Držislav and Svetislav, all the way to king Zvonimir from the end of the 11th century.\nThat inscription of king Zvonimir is already made in Croatian language, written in Glagolitic script (Baška tablet).\n\nDouble literacy and two scripts have been noticed in several monuments as Plomin tablet (Istria) and Valun tablet (Cres, 11th century) where we have Latin language and script as well as Croatian translation in Glagolitic script. Nevertheless, soon the Latin script replaced the Glagolitic which was the only way that Croats would be accepted into still Romanized Medieval Europe. However, Croats will use their native language and script all the way to the 16th century, especially in Istria, Kvarner and on the Croatian coast.\nAltar fences and stone perforated windows were decorated with shallow interlace ornament which we call Croatian interlace. Motifs of this interlace are often of classical origin (waves, three string interlace, pentagrams, nets of rhomboids, etc.), but while in the Roman art it was used only as a frame, here they cover the entire surface. Sheer number, but also the quality of stonework, of these monuments tells us of rich masonry tradition of numerous masters and workshops on the east coast of Adriatic. Comparing to thousands of fragments found in Dalmatia, in the northern Croatia there are only two confirmed founds: one in Lobor and one in Ilok.\n\nSometimes the interlace is replaced with figures of Gospels (like on the altar fence of Holy Sunday Church in Zadar), but those figures are flatten and their character lines are reduced to graphic lines in outmost linear stylization. The same is the relief from Crown Hollow church of king Zvonimir in Solin with the figure of \"(Croatian) king\" on the throne with Frankish crown, beside him is a page, and on the ground is a bowing subject. This relief is from the 15th century a front part of a baptistery in Split Cathedral.\n\nIn church of St. Mary from the 11th century in Bishopric (Biskupija) near Knin the oldest figure of Holy Mary in Croatia was found.\n\nCroatian interlace was originally painted, usually every string would be coloured brightly yellow, red or blue. Since the wall paintings that are mentioned in several literal sources (like the portraits of Trpimirović dynasty in church of St. George in Putalj above Kaštel Sućurac) are not preserved, they are only type of pre-Romanesque Croatian painting.\nThe only preserved paintings are found in the church of St. Michael near Ston from the 11th century . They were ordered by Doclean ruler Mihailo Vojislav, and were a work of local artist who with rough form and primitive materials achieved strong and suggestive expression in portrayed characters. The figure of a king that holds a model of a church has the same crown as the king depicted in the relief in Split baptistery. His portrait is also remarkable, it shows bony person with high eyebrows and wrinkled forehead, while his long hair and beard are already partly gray.\n\nFortunately significant number of church codices were preserved. They were done on pergam with pre-Romanesque miniatures of high quality and technique. The oldest one is Split Breviary that was written and painted from the 8th to 11th centuries, based on famous Breviaries from pre-Carolingian era. In Zagreb there is a Liber psalmorum which was illuminated in Benedictine style by prior Majon for archbishop Paul of Split (c. 1015–1030). In Vatican there is a Breviary, also in monte-cassino Benedictine style (initials of intertwined leaves, interlace and animal heads) which originates from monastery of St. Nicola in Osor. The same style of illumination we can found in Breviars in Trogir, Šibenik and Dubrovnik but there are many that were recorded (like 47 books in only one church in monastery of St. Peter in Seka) but not preserved.\n\n\n"}

It was founded by the managing director of Stuart Advertising Agency, Marcus Brumwell with Misha Black and Milner Gray in 1943. It became well known for its work in relation to the Festival of Britain in 1951 and its influential corporate identity project for British Rail in 1965. In 2004, DRU merged with Scott Brownrigg architects.\n\nThe group officially formed in 1943 following discussions begun by Marcus Brumwell, and the poet and writer Herbert Read the previous year. An early set of notes proposed a \"service equipped to advise on all problems of design\", addressing the needs of \"the State, Municipal Authorities, Industry or Commerce.\" They anticipated a post-war demand for technical expertise and a need for \"the reconditioning and re-designing public utility services\" recommending \"contact... with the railway companies, motor coach lines and so on.\"\n\nHerbert Read became their first member of staff, sharing offices in Kingsway with Mass-Observation, another initiative that Brumwell supported under the umbrella of the Advertising Services Guild. Read was joined by Bernard Hollowood in 1944 and after an unsuccessful tour of factories in the Midlands they engaged the sculptor Naum Gabo to design a new car for Jowett. The contract was terminated by the company in 1945.\n\nBlack and Gray were initially committed to wartime roles within the Exhibitions Department for the Ministry of Information. Under their leadership, DRU made important postwar contributions to the Britain Can Make It exhibition (1946) and Festival of Britain (1951). At the invitation of the Council of Industrial Design (afterward Design Council), DRU designed the Quiz Machines that sought to gauge public taste at BCMI, as well as the highly didactic ‘What Industrial Design Means’ display (by Black, Bronek Katz, and R. Vaughan). This marked the beginning of a long association between the two bodies. For the Festival of Britain they were the architects for the Regatta Restaurant and designed a series of displays for the Dome of Discovery.\n\nKey DRU commissions included the 1954 Electricity Board Showrooms, by Black, Gibson, and H. Diamond, the BOAC engineering hall at London Airport (Heathrow) by Black, Kenneth Bayes, and BOAC staff from 1951 to 1955, and a number of interiors for the P&O Orient Line's new liner \"Oriana\" by Black and Bayes in 1959. Other companies for whom DRU worked included Ilford, Courage, Watney Combe & Reid Dunlop, London Transport, and British Railways. The 1968 City of Westminster street name signs by Misha Black (typography and implementation by Christopher Timings and Roger Bridgman) have become an integral part of London's streetscape.\n\nSince this time, DRU has worked for many high-profile companies, in interior design, graphic design and architecture. Projects of note include:\n\nTheir work is the subject of a Cubitt Artists touring exhibition and publication by Michelle Cotton.\n\n\n"}

His family emigrated to Puerto Rico while he was a child during the François Duvalier regime. Duval-Carrié studied at the Université de Montréal and McGill University in Canada before graduating with a Bachelor of Arts from Loyola College, Montréal in 1978. He later attended the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France, from 1988 to 1989. He resided in France for many years and currently lives in Miami, Florida. \"I didn't want to go back to Haiti because of the political turmoil there. I have two kids,\" he explains. Instead he resides among Miami's substantial Haitian immigrant population and maintains cultural ties to his homeland. His works have been exhibited in Europe and the Americas.\n\nDuval-Carrié's art reflects the culture and history of Haiti with references to the Vodou religion. His work is often overtly political, executed in attempts to embody his nation's spirit and its troubles with an attitude that is neither detached nor ironic. His 1979 work \"J.C. Duvalier en Folle de Marié\" (\"Jean-Claude Duvalier as Mad Bride\") is a criticism of the country's controversial leader. Later in \"Mardigras at Fort Dimanche\" Duval-Carrié juxtaposes Duvalier against a torture chamber, an army general, and other symbols of the repressive regime. New York University classified his output as magical realism for an event to accompany the book launch of \"Continental Shifts: The Art of Edouard Duval-Carrié\", which was published by the university's press. He operates in a variety of media: altarpieces, lacquered tiles, and reliquaries in addition to painting and sculpture. Installations have become more prevalent in his recent output.\n\nAs Duval-Carrié explained his artistic motivations for a Miami art gallery:\nI have tried to analyze the historical context of the genesis of that partial island nation [Haiti], looked at the strife and suffering that brought the then society of slaves and slave masters to the point of ebullition. I look closely at the savagery on both parts of the struggle, understanding and giving my total sympathy to the downtrodden, not realizing that patterns are easily learned and extremely resilient to alteration... I have scrutinized the successive generations of pathetic leaders and their sordid entourages... But that is politics and an artist should be well cautioned to keep at bay that kind of poetry, which should be resumed as that of futility. So a step further or a level deeper was reached when the fabulous world of spirits, old and new, true and false, real and imagined, made themselves felt at different planes of consciousness. They come under many names, all quite entrancing. “Loas”, “Espirits”, or “Mysteres” all conveying a sense of foreboding inspiring the nebulousness from whence they come.\n\nDuval-Carrié's work was exhibited at the \"Ouidah '92\" festival, which celebrated Vodun art from Benin and the African Diaspora in Ouidah, Benin in February 1993.\nDuval-Carrié received a South Florida Cultural Consortium Visual Art Fellowship in 1995 and a Southern Arts Federation Visual Art Fellowship in 1996. His work has been shown in solo exhibitions in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, France, Mexico, and in several states of the United States. Two of the artist's works are displayed as public commissions in Miami: a 1996 piece for the Jefferson Reaves Rehabilitative and Health Center and \"The Lady of Miami\" at One Miami Riverwalk.\n\nThe following museums contain works by Duval-Carrié in their collections.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18949797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18949797", "title": "File sharing", "text": "File sharing\n\nFile sharing is the practice of distributing or providing access to digital media, such as computer programs, multimedia (audio, images and video), documents or electronic books. File sharing may be achieved in a number of ways. Common methods of storage, transmission and dispersion include manual sharing utilizing removable media, centralized servers on computer networks, World Wide Web-based hyperlinked documents, and the use of distributed peer-to-peer networking.\n\nPeer-to-peer file sharing is based on the peer-to-peer (P2P) application architecture. Shared files on the computers of other users are indexed on directory servers. P2P technology was used by popular services like Napster and Limewire. The most popular protocol for P2P sharing is BitTorrent.\n\nCloud-based file syncing and sharing services implement automated file transfers by updating files from a dedicated sharing directory on each user's networked devices. Files placed in this folder also are typically accessible through a website and mobile app, and can be easily shared with other users for viewing or collaboration. Such services have become popular via consumer-oriented file hosting services such as Dropbox and Google Drive.\n\nrsync is a more traditional program released in 1996 which synchronizes files on a direct machine-to-machine basis.\n\nData synchronization in general can use other approaches to share files, such as distributed filesystems, version control, or mirrors.\n\nFiles were first exchanged on removable media. Computers were able to access remote files using filesystem mounting, bulletin board systems (1978), Usenet (1979), and FTP servers (1985). Internet Relay Chat (1988) and Hotline (1997) enabled users to communicate remotely through chat and to exchange files. The mp3 encoding, which was standardized in 1991 and substantially reduced the size of audio files, grew to widespread use in the late 1990s. In 1998, MP3.com and Audiogalaxy were established, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act was unanimously passed, and the first mp3 player devices were launched.\n\nIn June 1999, Napster was released as an unstructured centralized peer-to-peer system, requiring a central server for indexing and peer discovery. It is generally credited as being the first peer-to-peer file sharing system.\n\nGnutella, eDonkey2000, and Freenet were released in 2000, as MP3.com and Napster were facing litigation. Gnutella, released in March, was the first decentralized file sharing network. In the gnutella network, all connecting software was considered equal, and therefore the network had no central point of failure. In July, Freenet was released and became the first anonymity network. In September the eDonkey2000 client and server software was released.\n\nIn 2001, Kazaa and Poisoned for the Mac was released. Its FastTrack network was distributed, though unlike gnutella, it assigned more traffic to 'supernodes' to increase routing efficiency. The network was proprietary and encrypted, and the Kazaa team made substantial efforts to keep other clients such as Morpheus off of the FastTrack network.\n\nIn July 2001, Napster was sued by several recording companies and lost in A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.. In the case of Napster, it has been ruled that an online service provider could not use the \"transitory network transmission\" safe harbor in the DMCA if they had control of the network with a server.\n\nShortly after its loss in court, Napster was shut down to comply with a court order. This drove users to other P2P applications and file sharing continued its growth. The Audiogalaxy Satellite client grew in popularity, and the LimeWire client and BitTorrent protocol were released. Until its decline in 2004, Kazaa was the most popular file sharing program despite bundled malware and legal battles in the Netherlands, Australia, and the United States. In 2002, a Tokyo district court ruling shut down File Rogue, and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) filed a lawsuit that effectively shut down Audiogalaxy.\n\nFrom 2002 through 2003, a number of BitTorrent services were established, including Suprnova.org, isoHunt, TorrentSpy, and The Pirate Bay. In 2002, the RIAA was filing lawsuits against Kazaa users. As a result of such lawsuits, many universities added file sharing regulations in their school administrative codes (though some students managed to circumvent them during after school hours). With the shutdown of eDonkey in 2005, eMule became the dominant client of the eDonkey network. In 2006, police raids took down the Razorback2 eDonkey server and temporarily took down The Pirate Bay.\n\n“The File Sharing Act was launched by Chairman Towns in 2009, this act prohibited the use of applications that allowed individuals to share federal information amongst one another. On the other hand, only specific file sharing application were made available to federal computers” (United States.Congress.House). In 2009, the Pirate Bay trial ended in a guilty verdict for the primary founders of the tracker. The decision was appealed, leading to a second guilty verdict in November 2010. In October 2010, Limewire was forced to shut down following a court order in Arista Records LLC v. Lime Group LLC but the gnutella network remains active through open source clients like Frostwire and gtk-gnutella. Furthermore, multi-protocol file sharing software such as MLDonkey and Shareaza adapted in order to support all the major file sharing protocols, so users no longer had to install and configure multiple file sharing programs.\n\nOn January 19, 2012, the United States Department of Justice shut down the popular domain of Megaupload (established 2005). The file sharing site has claimed to have over 50,000,000 people a day. Kim Dotcom (formerly Kim Schmitz) was arrested with three associates in New Zealand on January 20, 2012 and is awaiting extradition. The case involving the downfall of the world's largest and most popular file sharing site was not well received, with hacker group Anonymous bringing down several sites associated with the take-down. In the following days, other file sharing sites began to cease services; Filesonic blocked public downloads on January 22, with Fileserve following suit on January 23.\n\nIn 2004 there were an estimated 70 million people participating in online file sharing. According to a CBS News poll in 2009, 58% of Americans who follow the file sharing issue, considered it acceptable \"if a person owns the music CD and shares it with a limited number of friends and acquaintances\"; with 18- to 29-year-olds this percentage reached as much as 70%.\n\nIn his survey of file-sharing culture, Caraway (2012) noted that 74.4% of participants believed musicians should accept file sharing as a means for promotion and distribution.\n\nAccording to David Glenn, writing in \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\", \"A majority of economic studies have concluded that file sharing hurts sales\". A literature review by Professor Peter Tschmuck found 22 independent studies on the effects of music file sharing. \"Of these 22 studies, 14 – roughly two-thirds – conclude that unauthorized downloads have a 'negative or even highly negative impact' on recorded music sales. Three of the studies found no significant impact while the remaining five found a positive impact.\"\n\nA study by economists Felix Oberholzer-Gee and Koleman Strumpf in 2004 concluded that music file sharing's effect on sales was \"statistically indistinguishable from zero\". This research was disputed by other economists, most notably Stan Liebowitz, who said Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf had made multiple assumptions about the music industry \"that are just not correct.\" In June 2010, \"Billboard\" reported that Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf had \"changed their minds\", now finding \"no more than 20% of the recent decline in sales is due to sharing\". However, citing Nielsen SoundScan as their source, the co-authors maintained that illegal downloading had not deterred people from being original. \"In many creative industries, monetary incentives play a reduced role in motivating authors to remain creative. Data on the supply of new works are consistent with the argument that file sharing did not discourage authors and publishers. Since the advent of file sharing, the production of music, books, and movies has increased sharply.\" Glenn Peoples of \"Billboard\" disputed the underlying data, saying \"SoundScan's number for new releases in any given year represents new commercial titles, not necessarily new creative works.\" The RIAA likewise responded that \"new releases\" and \"new creative works\" are two separate things. \"[T]his figure includes re-releases, new compilations of existing songs, and new digital-only versions of catalog albums. SoundScan has also steadily increased the number of retailers (especially non-traditional retailers) in their sample over the years, better capturing the number of new releases brought to market. What Oberholzer and Strumpf found was better ability to track new album releases, not greater incentive to create them.\"\n\nA 2006 study prepared by Birgitte Andersen and Marion Frenz, published by Industry Canada, was \"unable to discover any direct relationship between P2P file-sharing and CD purchases in Canada\". The results of this survey were similarly criticized by academics and a subsequent revaluation of the same data by Dr. George R. Barker of the Australian National University reached the opposite conclusion. \"In total, 75% of P2P downloaders responded that if P2P were not available they would have purchased either through paid sites only (9%), CDs only (17%) or through CDs and pay sites (49%). Only 25% of people say they would not have bought the music if it were not available on P2P for free.\" Barker thus concludes; \"This clearly suggests P2P network availability is reducing music demand of 75% of music downloaders which is quite contrary to Andersen and Frenz's much published claim.\"\n\nAccording to the 2017 paper \"Estimating displacement rates of copyrighted content in the EU\" by the European Commission, illegal usage increases game sales, stating \"The overall conclusion is that for games, illegal online transactions induce more legal transactions.\"\n\nA paper in journal \"\" found that file sharing decreased the chance of survival for low ranked albums on music charts and increased exposure to albums that were ranked high on the music charts, allowing popular and well known artists to remain on the music charts more often. This had a negative impact for new and less known artists while promoting the work of already popular artists and celebrities.\n\nA more recent study that examined pre-release file sharing of music albums, using BitTorrent software, also discovered positive impacts for \"established and popular artists but not newer and smaller artists.\" According to Robert G. Hammond of North Carolina State University, an album that leaked one month early would see a modest increase in sales. \"This increase in sales is small relative to other factors that have been found to affect album sales.\"\n\n\"File-sharing proponents commonly argue that file sharing democratizes music consumption by 'leveling the playing field' for new/small artists relative to established/popular artists, by allowing artists to have their work heard by a wider audience, lessening the advantage held by established/popular artists in terms of promotional and other support. My results suggest that the opposite is happening, which is consistent with evidence on file-sharing behavior.\"\n\n\"Billboard\" cautioned that this research looked only at the pre-release period and not continuous file sharing following a release date. \"The problem in believing piracy helps sales is deciding where to draw the line between legal and illegal ... Implicit in the study is the fact that both buyers and sellers are required in order for pre-release file sharing to have a positive impact on album sales. Without iTunes, Amazon and Best Buy, file-sharers would be just file sharers rather than purchasers. If you carry out the 'file sharing should be legal' argument to its logical conclusion, today's retailers will be tomorrow's file-sharing services that integrate with their respective cloud storage services.\"\n\nMany argue that file-sharing has forced the owners of entertainment content to make it more widely available legally through fee or advertising on demand on the internet. In a 2011 report by Sandvine showed that Netflix traffic had come to surpass that of Bittorrent.\n\nFile sharing raises copyright issues and has led to many lawsuits. In the United States, some of these lawsuits have even reached the Supreme Court. For example, in \"MGM v. Grokster\", the Supreme Court ruled that the creators of P2P networks can be held liable if their software is marketed as a tool for copyright infringement.\n\nOn the other hand, not all file sharing is illegal. Content in the public domain can be freely shared. Even works covered by copyright can be shared under certain circumstances. For example, some artists, publishers, and record labels grant the public a license for unlimited distribution of certain works, sometimes with conditions, and they advocate free content and file sharing as a promotional tool.\n\n\n"}

Heroyam slava!\"; translated as: \"Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the heroes!\") is a commonly used greeting and slogan in Ukraine. Since October 2018 \"Glory to Ukraine\" is an official greeting of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the Ukrainian National Police.\n\nThe phrase “\"Slava Ukrayini!\"” (Glory to Ukraine!) first appeared in different military formations during the Ukrainian War of Independence (from 1917 to 1921). It became part of the lexicon of Ukrainian nationalists in the 1920's.\n\nThe modern response \"Heroyam slava!\" (Glory to the heroes!) appeared in the 1930s among members of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) and Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) who started using this slogan, replacing all former responses with it as a mark of deep respect for all the men and women who had laid down their lives for their country. The partisans thus honoured the memory of all the brave soldiers and passed it on to future generations. The greeting \"Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the heroes!\" became an official slogan of Stepan Bandera's OUN-B in April 1941.\n\n“\"Slava Ukrayini! Heroyam slava!\"\" became very popular in the 1940s and 1950s when the OUN/UPA partisan movement fighting against the Polish and Soviet occupiers swept across most of western Ukraine. \"Glory to the heroes!\" was also used by the Kuban Cossacks dating back to at least 1944 with the return of the Cossack Rebel Army who fought with the UPA. In the Soviet Union the slogan “Slava Ukrayini!” was forbidden and discredited in a decades long propaganda campaign alongside the Ukrainian nationalists who used it. They were dubbed \"Nazi henchmen\".\n\nIn the late 1980's and early 1990's the slogan began to be heard at rallies and demonstrations. After Ukraine declared independence in 1991, the phrase \"Glory to Ukraine\" became a common patriotic slogan. In 1995, President of the United States Bill Clinton used the phrase in his speech in Kiev (together with \"God bless America\").\n\nThe phrase has undergone a resurgence in recent times, becoming a popular and prominent refrain during the 2014 Ukrainian revolution. In September 2014, after addressing a gathering of the United States Congress in Washington, D.C., Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko concluded his speech by uttering the phrase.\n\nIt is also commonly used in greeting to Ukraine from the world leaders.\n\nOn July 10, 2018, Ukrainian supporters flooded the Facebook page of football governing body FIFA with over 158,000 comments, most saying \"Glory to Ukraine\", after FIFA fined Croatia's assistant coach for a video in which he used the same slogan after Croatia's World Cup victory. Russia alleged that the chant has ultra-nationalist connotations, as it was popularized by World War II era groups, such as the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), who collaborated with the Nazis. The Football Federation of Ukraine said in a statement that \"\"Glory to Ukraine\" is a commonly used greeting in Ukraine ... (and) should not be interpreted as an act of aggression or provocation\".\n\nOn 9 August 2018 Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko announced that \"Glory to Ukraine\" will be the official greeting of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, replacing \"Hello Comrades\" (\"Вітаю товариші\", \"Vitayu tovaryshi\"). The greeting was used during the Kiev Independence Day Parade on 24 August 2018. The Ukrainian parliament approved the President's bill on this (in its first reading) on 6 September and on 4 October 2018. Parliament also made Glory to Ukraine the official greeting of the National Police of Ukraine.\n\nOn 7 September 2018, the Ukrainian national football team wore the phrase on their kits, during a UEFA Nations League match with the Czech Republic.\n\n"}

It is one of the most visited touristic highlights in the country. The museum receives around 500,000 tourists per year.\n\nThe museum displays a selection of pre-Columbian gold and other metal alloys, such as \"Tumbaga\", and contains the largest collection of gold artifacts in the world in its exhibition rooms on the second and third floors. Together with pottery, stone, shell, wood and textile objects, these items, made of a– to indigenous cultures – sacred metal, testify to the life and thought of the different societies which lived in present-day Colombia before the Spanish conquest of the Americas.\n\nIn 1934, the Bank of the Republic began helping to protect the archaeological patrimony of Colombia. The object known as Poporo Quimbaya was the first one in a collection. It has been on exhibition for 70 years. The Museum is today administered by Banrepcultural.\n\nThe museum houses the famous Muisca golden raft found in Pasca in 1969, that represents the ceremony of the new \"zipa\" (ruler) of Bacatá, the basis for the \"El Dorado\" myth. The heir to the chieftaincy assumed power with a great offering to the gods. In this representation he is seen standing at the centre of a raft, surrounded by the principal chieftains, all of them adorned with gold and feathers.\n\nAfter a decade of work, the museum was expanded and renovated in October 2008. With the renovation, the museum organized the permanent exhibition in five rooms with archaeological objects and an interactive room. It also added an auditorium, some temporary exhibitions rooms, a cafe, a restaurant, and a souvenir store.\n\nThe museum has a collection of 55,000 pieces, 6,000 of which are on display in their expanded building. There are bilingual descriptions of almost all exhibits. On the first floor houses the museum's main entrance, a shop, and a restaurant.\n\nExhibitions begin on the second floor. The main room is called \"People and Gold in pre-Hispanic Colombia\". In glass vitrines display goldsmiths' work from the different cultures which inhabited Colombia before the Spanish colonists arrived. The permanent exhibition is divided into different halls for every culture: Calima, Quimbaya, Muisca, Zenú, Tierradentro, San Agustín, Tolima, Tairona, and Urabá, and a special room called \"After Columbus\" (\"Después de Colón\").\n\nThe exposition continues on the third floor, with \"The Flying Chamanic\" and \"The Offering.\" The first shows the process of a shamanic ceremony with its different gold pieces, the second is divided into three parts: the \"Offering Room\", the \"Offering Boat\", and the \"Lake\".\n\nAt the end of the exposition, there is a \"Profunditation Room\" with artistic videos about the most important gold pieces of the museum.\n\n\n"}

The Parthians in particular were very keen in using such structures in their designs. The Sassanids inherited them and elevated their designs into full maturity.\n\nA gonbad is often double layered, and can have many shapes, such as semi-spherical, partial spherical, onion shaped, paraboloid, polygonal conical, and circular conical.\n\nIn pre-Islamic times, the gonbad was a sign of imperial grandeur for the king. In Islamic times, the tradition continued, and the interiors were made to simulate the celestial dome, reminding the Muslim of Man's place in the cosmos compared to God and creation.\n\nKümbet is the name given to Seljuq mausoleums. Kümbet are an important part of Seljuq architecture. In Turkey, Azerbaijan and Iran where the Turks set up states and ruled for centuries, there are a number of examples of such mausoleums. Particularly fashionable in the thirteenth century, these monuments, referred to in Turkish as \"kümbet\", are a continuation of the Turkish burial customs of Central Asia. These structures are either polygonal or cylindrical in shape arid are covered with a dome. The main body of the monument rests on a cubic base, the corners of which are bevelled. In the examples built before the 16th century, the dome is covered with a conical or pyramidal spire. Most of these monuments are two storied. Concealed inside the base, half of which is below ground level, is a crypt; the latter is covered by a vault and its floor is earth. The deceased was buried in the earth. The crypt had small loop-hole windows. Most kümbet in Turkey are found in the provinces of Kayseri, Erzurum, Konya, Ahlat and Bitlis\n\nThe Kümbet of Hudavend Hatun is located in Niğde city. It was built in 1312 and was commissioned by Hudavend Hatun, daughter of the Seljuk Sultan Kilij Arslan IV, and was restored by the General Directorate of Religious Endowments (Vakiflar Genel Mudurlugu) in 1962. The tomb is made of yellow cut stone and is covered by a dome topped with an eight-faceted pyramidal crown on the exterior. Total height is 15.5 meters. White marble was used in the lintels, the arches, the inscription plaques, and the cornice of the dome. The tomb is most known for its elaborate vegetal and zoomorphic carvings.\n\nThe Revolving Tomb is in the way to Talas in Kayseri, as it is called, does not revolve, but its cylindrical form makes it look as though it might. Built in 1276 as the final resting-place of Şah Cihan Hatun, an imperial princess, it is covered in high-relief arabesque decoration depicting animals and plants. The nearby Sirçali Kümbet is not quite as elaborate. The Çifte Kümbet (Double Tomb) (also in Kayseri), 5 km along on the way to Sivas, is yet another of these characteristic Seljuq royal tombs.\n\nAbout 2 km to the north of the Gevaş district on the shore of Lake Van there is an old graveyard that has been in use ever since the Seljuq period. One of the most impressive pre-Ottoman grave monuments is the Kümbet of Halime Hatun, which is in the same graveyard. This monument was recently repaired and changes made to the entrance to the crypt. It attracted the attention of a number of travellers who visited the area in the last century, prompting W. Bachmann to make a serious study of it. However, the fırst scientifıc study of this monument was carried out by Prof. Dr. Oktay Aslanapa.\n\nThis monument lies 1–2 km to the east of Erciş, at the junction of the Erciş–Van and Patnos–Van roads. It was repaired in the 1970s, when crumbling stones on the base and main body of the monument were replaced. Stone staircases leading to the crypt and to the upper floor were built at the same time. A wall was also built around the garden in which the monument lies.\n\nThis monument, which lies on level ground to the left of the Erciş–Patnos road above 5 km northwest of Erciş itself, has no special name. Abdürrahim Şerif Beygu, who visited the monument in 1931, stated that its east window part of the spire had crumbled away. Oktay Aslanapa confirms this information, stating that the upper part of the roof had collapsed and that the monument was in a very poor state. Repairs have been carried out which have halted its deterioration.\n\nGol Gumbaz (Kannada: ಗೋಲ ಗುಮ್ಮಟ) (Urdu: گول گمبد) is the mausoleum of Mohammed Adil Shah (1627–55) of the Adil Shahi dynasty of Indian sultans, who ruled the Sultanate of Bijapur from 1490 to 1686.\n\nThe tomb, located in the city of Bijapur, or Vijapur in Karnataka, southern India, was built in 1659 by the famous architect, Yaqut of Dabul. The structure consists of a massive square chamber measuring nearly 50 m (160 ft) on each side and covered by a huge dome 43.3 m (142 ft) in diameter making it among one of the largest dome structures in world. The dome is supported on giant squinches supported by groined pendentives while outside the building is supported by domed octagonal corner towers.\n\nThe Dome is the second largest one in the world which is unsupported by any pillars.\n\nThe acoustics of the enclosed place make it a whispering gallery where even the smallest sound is heard across the other side of the Gumbaz. At the periphery of the dome is a circular balcony where visitors can witness the astounding whispering gallery. Any whisper, clap or sound gets echoed around 7 times. Anything whispered from one corner of the gallery can be heard clearly on the diagonally opposite side. It is also said that the Sultan, Ibrahim Adil Shah and his Queen used to converse in the same manner. During his time, the musicians used to sing, seated in the whispering gallery so that the sound produced could reach every corner of the hall.\n\nOne can easily make out the restoration carried out on the structure by comparing the photographs. The surroundings have been converted into a splendid garden and the site is maintained by The Archaeological Survey of India.The Archaeological Survey of India.\n\nThe word \"gonbad\" was borrowed into Chinese as \"gongbei\", where it refers to Islamic tombs (originally, domed).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56310832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56310832", "title": "Goncourt Journal", "text": "Goncourt Journal\n\nThe Goncourt Journal was a diary written in collaboration by the brothers Edmond and Jules de Goncourt from 1850 up to Jules' death in 1870, and then by Edmond alone up to a few weeks before his own death in 1896. It forms an unrivalled and entirely candid chronicle of the literary and artistic Parisian world in which they lived, \"a world\", it has been said, \"of bitter rivalries and bitterer friendships, in which every gathering around a café table on the Grands Boulevards [was] a chance to raise one's status in the byzantine literary hierarchy\". Fear of lawsuits by the Goncourts' friends and their heirs prevented publication of anything but carefully chosen selections from the Journal for many years, but a complete edition of the original French text appeared in the 1950s in 22 volumes, and there have been several selective translations into English.\n\nThe Goncourt brothers formed a very close literary partnership. Not only were all of their novels, dramas and non-fiction works written in collaboration until Jules' death but, more surprisingly, so was their Journal. The Journal was produced by a process Edmond called \"dual dictation\", one brother dictating to the other and each revising the other's work. Their styles were so similar that it is impossible to tell which brother was writing any particular passage. For the most part they wrote the Journal late at night, without much consideration about literary style, and there are therefore few of the laboured mannerisms that characterize their novels. Edmond himself admitted that because the journal entries were \"hastily set down on paper and not always re-read, our syntax is sometimes happy-go-lucky and not all our words have passports\", and they particularly delighted in accurately recording the slanginess and vulgarity of ordinary speech. The collaboration came to an end with Jules' decline and early death from syphilis, recorded by his brother in excruciating detail. When that story drew to its close Edmond initially decided to abandon the Journal, but he took it up again in time to give a detailed description of life during the Franco-Prussian War, the siege of Paris, and the Commune. Some critics find that the Journal improved when Edmond resumed it without Jules.\n\nThe many accounts of conversations in the Journal were aided by Edmond's excellent memory, and, according to Flaubert, by Jules' habit of jotting notes on his shirt-cuff on the spot. Ludovic Halévy, who was present at many of these conversations, gave the brothers credit for extreme accuracy, and similarly the narrator of Proust's \"\" thought that Edmond de Goncourt \"knew how to listen, just as he knew how to see\"; but some among the Goncourts' contemporaries claimed that the brothers either consciously or unconsciously distorted the conversations they recorded. The painter Jacques Blanche, for example, said that \"nothing is less true than their journals\", though André Gide, who thoroughly enjoyed the Journal's accounts of conversations, retorted that that would make the Goncourts' achievement as original artists all the greater.\n\nThe Goncourt's Journal was started on the same day that they published their first novel, 2 December 1851, which was unluckily also the day that Louis-Napoleon launched his \"coup d' état\", leading to the imposition of martial law in Paris. In this turmoil the novel passed almost unnoticed. The Goncourts' disappointment over this failure was duly recorded in the Journal, thereby setting the dominant tone for the remaining 45 years. Poor sales, poor reviews, and the undeserved successes of their literary friends are recorded in meticulous detail. \"Oh, if one of Dostoyevsky's novels, whose black melancholy is regarded with such indulgent admiration, were signed with the name of Goncourt, what a slating it would get all along the line.\" Zola was one friend who came in for especially barbed comment, since the Goncourts felt that his subject matter and literary techniques had been borrowed from theirs. \"The critics may say what they like about Zola, they cannot prevent us, my brother and myself, from being the John-the-Baptists of modern neurosis.\" Some few friends did come in for sympathetic treatment, notably Princess Mathilde Bonaparte, Paul Gavarni, Théophile Gautier, Alphonse Daudet and, initially at least, Gustave Flaubert and Paul de Saint-Victor. The critic Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve regularly appeared in the Journal, as did the painter Edgar Degas and the sculptor Auguste Rodin. Appearances are also made by Heinrich Heine, Charles Baudelaire, Victor Hugo, Ernest Renan, Hippolyte Taine, Joris-Karl Huysmans, Guy de Maupassant, Alexandre Dumas \"père\" and \"fils\", Stéphane Mallarmé, Georg Brandes, Ivan Turgenev and Oscar Wilde. Not surprisingly, the often backbiting tone of the Journal led to strained relations with Edmond's surviving friends when they came to read his treatment of them in the published volumes. As late as the 1950s the Daudet family, concerned for the reputation of their ancestor Alphonse, were still trying to block publication of the complete Journal.\n\nA few carefully chosen selections from the Journal were published by the Goncourts in a now little-known book, \"Idées et Sensations\" (1866; new edition 1877). In 1886 Edmond published in \"Le Figaro\" some extracts from the Journal dating from the years before Jules' death, and the following year a more substantial selection of letters from the same years appeared in book form under the title \"Journal des Goncourt: Mémoires de la vie littéraire\". Eight more volumes were published at the rate of roughly one a year, some being first serialized in \"L'Écho de Paris\". The last volume appeared in May 1896, two months before Edmond's death.\n\n\"Le Figaro\" called the first volume a masterpiece of conceit. Worse, after three weeks only 2000 copies had been sold, provoking Edmond to say \"Really, for a result like that it is not worth risking duels\". \"Le Figaro\" continued its attacks, writing on the publication of Edmond's fourth volume \"He listens and thinks he can hear, he looks and thinks he can see…Of the literary élite of his age…the best of their kind, all that he has managed to give us most of the time is a grotesque and often repulsive picture\". The seventh volume called forth hostile articles in the \"Journal des débats\" and the \"Courrier français\", while \"Le Figaro\" reported that a Funeral Committee was being set up on Edmond's behalf. Excrement was sent to him through the post. \n\nOn the other hand Anatole France wrote that \"this perfectly private \njournal is at the same time perfectly literary\", and absolved the Goncourts of indiscretion because \"[t]hey neither heard nor saw except in art and for \nart\". To American critics the Goncourts' indiscretion naturally seemed less immediately alarming than to most of their French colleagues. The \"Atlantic Monthly\" thought that in fifty years time it would be \"the most fascinating and vivid history in existence of the literary and artistic life of Paris during the last half of [the 19th] century\", but that its portrait of the close partnership of the Goncourts themselves was of still greater interest. Henry James, writing in \"The Fortnightly Review\", thought that both the Journal and its authors would have been improved if they had not restricted their social life to a narrow coterie: \"The Journal…is mainly a record of resentment and suffering, and to this circumstance they attribute many causes; but we suspect that the real cause is for them too the inconvenience from which we suffer as readers – simply the want of space and air.\" \n\nAfter Edmond's death Proust paid the Journal the tribute of including a pastiche of it in his \"À la recherche du temps perdu\", and indeed the Journal's obsessive collecting of the most minute details of its authors' social life and rendering of them into literary art has been said to anticipate the supposed innovations of Proust. In 1940 Christopher Isherwood confided in his own journal that \"Here, gossip achieves the epigrammatic significance of poetry\". As late as 1962 one reviewer found it necessary to warn his more delicate readers about the scabrousness of much of the conversation recorded, and in 1971 the Goncourts' translators George J. Becker and Edith Philips wrote of the emotional detachment, even heartlessness, to be found everywhere in the journal except in those passages that depict Edmond's relationship with his brother and with Daudet. In more recent years Jacques Noiray called it \"a modern \"Comédie humaine\" of the republic of letters\", while according to another literary scholar, David Baguley, the Journal is \"an immense machine for transforming lived experience into documentary form\", to be used as raw material by the Goncourts when writing their novels. \n\nIn the 21st century the Journal's repute is as high as ever. The German satirist Harald Schmidt has called it \"the greatest gossip in world literature – it's sensational!\", and for the historian Graham Robb it is \"one of the longest, most absorbing, and most enlightening diaries in European literature\". The critic Adam Kirsch attributes the modern age's interest in late-19th century French literary life to the Goncourt Journal.\n\nBy Edmond's will, the manuscripts of the Journal were bequeathed to the Académie Goncourt, itself a creation of the same will, with instructions that they be strictly protected from public scrutiny for 20 years in the vaults of the \"Bibliothèque nationale de France\", after which they were to be made public either by allowing access to them or by publication in print. In the event, the Académie did neither of these things in 1916, fearing libel actions, though the public were finally allowed to see the manuscripts in 1925. In 1935-1936 the Académie did produce an \"édition définitive\", albeit a selective one, in nine volumes, and in 1945 they announced that a complete edition would appear the following year. This proved to be far too optimistic, the first editor, Robert Burnand, still having not brought the project to completion at his death in 1953. The editorship was taken over by Robert Ricatte, and it was finally published in 22 volumes between 1956 and 1959. A new multi-volume edition, the work of a large editorial team under the direction of Jean-Louis Cabanès, began to appear in 2005.\n\nNo complete translation of the Goncourt Journal into English has ever appeared, but there have been several selections. The first, \"Edmond and Jules de Goncourt: With Letters and Leaves from their Journals\", compiled and translated by Marie Belloc and Marie L. Shedlock, appeared in two volumes as early as 1895, before the nine volumes of Edmond de Goncourt's edition had yet been completed. This was followed by Julius West's \"The Journal of the Goncourts\" in 1908, and by Lewis Galantière's \"The Goncourt Journals 1851-1870\" in 1937. In 1962 Oxford University Press published Robert Baldick's much-praised \"Pages from the Goncourt Journal\", reprinted in 1984 by Penguin Books and in 2006 by New York Review Books. George J. Becker has also edited and translated two thematic selections: \"Paris Under Siege, 1870-1871\" (1969), and (in collaboration with Edith Philips) \"Paris and the Arts, 1851-1896\" (1971).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43846546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43846546", "title": "Graphotype", "text": "Graphotype\n\nGraphotype was a process of autographic engraving by which typographic printing blocks were produced.\n\nA block of chalk or some similar material is reduced to a level surface. On this surface, a design is drawn with a glutinous ink, the ink being sufficiently fluid to penetrate some little distance into the porous chalk. The ink having become dry, gentle friction is applied to the surface of the block so as gradually to rub away those parts of the chalk which are not indurated by the glutinous ink. The lines of the drawing being thus left in relief, a perfect model of the required printing block is obtained and this model is next hardened by immersion in a bath containing a solution of an alkaline silicate. After this, the block is dried and reproduced by the stereotype or the electrotype process.\n\nThis method of typographic engraving was brought to a practical form and patented in 1860 by an American wood engraver, Mr. de Witt Clinton Hitchcock. The first step in his process is to reduce French chalk or talc to an extremely fine state of division by repeated grindings, elutriations, and siftings. After this is complete, a layer of the material (over an eighth of an inch in thickness) is forced down upon and made to adhere to a thick zinc plate, the necessary pressure being obtained by means of an hydraulic press, the platen of which is faced with a polished steel plate, so as to communicate a good surface to the layer of compressed French chalk. The device is now drawn reversed on the prepared block with an ink consisting of a weak solution of glue colored by lamp black or some other pigment. In drawing on the prepared block, care must be taken not to damage the somewhat tender surface of the compressed chalk and the safest instrument with which to apply the glutinous ink is a fine sable brush, but an ordinary pen may be employed if the operation of drawing is performed with caution. A pad of silk velvet or a fitch brush may be used for rubbing the block so as to leave the lines in relief, and it is quite sufficient to continue the friction until a depth equal to the thickness of an ordinary playing card is produced, the spaces corresponding to any extended whites of the engraving being then cut out by means of a tool. A 10% solution of sodium silicate may be used for hardening the block and, when dry, nothing remains but to take a mould from it and to reproduce it in metal.\n"}

Holda, Holle, Huld, and Hulda may be cognate of the Scandinavian creature known as the \"huldra\". Jacob Grimm made an attempt to establish her as a Germanic goddess.\n\nFrom German \"huld\" (\"gracious, friendly, sympathetic, grateful\"), Middle High German \"hulde\", Old High German \"huldī\" (\"friendliness\"). Cognate with Danish and Swedish \"huld\" (\"fair, kindly, gracious\"), Icelandic \"hollur\" (\"faithful, dedicated, loyal\"), Middle English \"hold\", \"holde\", Old English \"hold\" (\"gracious, friendly, kind, favorable, true, faithful, loyal, devout, acceptable, pleasant\"), from Proto-Germanic \"hulþaz\" (\"favourable, gracious, loyal\"), from Proto-Indo-European \"*kel-\" (\"to tend, incline, bend, tip\").\n\nThe name \"Hludana\" is found in five Latin inscriptions: three from the lower Rhine (\"Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum\" XIII 8611, 8723, 8661), one from Münstereifel () and one from Beetgum, Frisia () all dating from 197 AD-235 AD. Many attempts have been made to interpret this name.\n\nFrau Holda's festival is in the middle of winter, the time when humans retreat indoors from the cold. It may be of significance that the Twelve Days of Christmas were originally the \"Zwölften\" (\"the Twelve\"), which like the same period in the Celtic calendar were an intercalary period during which the dead were thought to roam abroad.\n\nHolda's connection to the spirit world through the magic of spinning and weaving has associated her with witchcraft in Catholic German folklore. She was considered to ride with witches on distaffs, which closely resemble the brooms that witches are thought to ride. Likewise, Holda was often identified with Diana in old church documents. As early as the beginning of the eleventh century she appears to have been known as the leader of women and female nocturnal spirits, which \"in common parlance are called Hulden from Holda\". These women would leave their houses in spirit, going \"out through closed doors in the silence of the night, leaving their sleeping husbands behind\". They would travel vast distances through the sky, to great feasts, or to battles amongst the clouds.\n\nThe ninth century Canon Episcopi censures women who claim to have ridden with a \"crowd of demons.\" Burchard's later recension of the same text expands on this in a section titled De arte magica:\n\nHave you believed there is some female, whom the stupid vulgar call Holda [or, in some manuscripts, strigam Holdam, the witch Holda], who is able to do a certain thing, such that those deceived by the devil affirm themselves by necessity and by command to be required to do, that is, with a crowd of demons transformed into the likeness of women, on fixed nights to be required to ride upon certain beasts, and to themselves be numbered in their company? If you have performed participation in this unbelief, you are required to do penance for one year on designated fast-days.\n\nLater canonical and church documents make her synonymous with Diana, Herodias, Bertha, Richella and Abundia. Historian Carlo Ginzburg has identified similar beliefs existing throughout Europe for over a thousand years, whereby men and women were thought to leave their bodies in spirit and follow a goddess variously called Holda, Diana, Herodias, Signora Oriente, Richella, Arada and Perchta. He also identifies strong morphological similarities with the earlier goddesses Hecate/Artemis, Artio, the Matres of Engyon, the Matronae and Epona, as well as figures from fairy-tales, such as Cinderella.\n\nA 16th-century fable recorded by Erasmus Alberus speaks of \"an army of women\" with sickles in hand sent by Frau Hulda. Thomas Reinesius in the 17th century speaks of Werra of the Voigtland and her \"crowd of maenads.\"\n\nHolda figures in some pre-Christian Alpine traditions that have survived to modern times. During the Christmas period in the alpine regions of Germany, Austria and northern Switzerland, wild masked processions are still held in a number of towns, impersonating Holda, Perchta or related beings, and the wild hunt. Vivid visual descriptions of her may allude to a popular costumed portrayal, perhaps as part of a seasonal festival or holiday drama. In 1522, in \"The Exposition of the Epistles at Basel\", Martin Luther writes:\n\n\"Here cometh up Dame Hulde with the snout, to wit, nature, and goeth about to gainstay her God and give him the lie, hangeth her old ragfair about her, the straw-harness; then falls to work and scrapes it featly on her fiddle.\"\n\nGrimm based his theory of Holda on what he took to be the earliest references to her: an eleventh-century interpolation to the \"Canon Episcopi\" by Burchard of Worms, and pre-Christian Roman inscriptions to \"Hludana\" that he tentatively linked to the same divinity. There were early challenges to connecting this figure with a pagan goddess, since her earliest definite appearance links her with the Virgin Mary, commonly called \"Queen of Heaven\": an early-13th-century text listing superstitions states that \"In the night of Christ's Nativity they set the table for the Queen of Heaven, whom the people call Frau Holda, that she might help them\". Lotte Motz and Carlo Ginzburg both conclude that she is pre-Christian in origin, based on comparison with other remarkably similar figures and ritual observances spread throughout Europe.\n\nA pagan Holda received wide distribution in catalogs of superstitions and in sermons during the fifteenth century, and in the sixteenth, Martin Luther employed the image to personify the shortcomings of hostile Reason in theological contexts.\n\nThe most famous account of Holda was collected by the Brothers Grimm, the fairy tale \"Mother Hulda\" ().\n\n"}

She was praised as a great dramatic by her contemporaries.\n\nJeanette was born child of the writer and actor Per Adolf Granberg and was from 1849 and forwards active as a translator and a writer of plays for the theatre. She debuted with the play \"Filantropen\" in 1847 and several of her plays were performed in the 1850-51 season.\n\nAmong her more known plays were \"Läsarepresten\", a play in four acts, \"Fyra dagar af konung Gustaf III:s lefnad\", a historical play in four acts, and \"Tidningsskrifvaren\", a play in five acts, all of which were performed in the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm. She did not only write alone, but also together with her sister, Louise Granberg. Both siblings used male pseudonyms, Jeanette wrote under the name \"Georges Malméen\". She made great successes with her plays in 1855 and 1857. In \"Läsareprästen\"(The vicar), she criticized religious fanaticism in her story about a priest who takes power in a community before the monarch and the people drive him out and reform the society, and in \"Hos oss eller en motbild till Onkel Toms stuga\" (At our place or a likeness to Uncle Tom's cabin), she treats the subject of poverty and charity. She was well known to be the author of her plays, but her name was not usually on the posting for the play, as this was considered to be unsuitable for her gender.\n\nShe married the actor Edvard Stjernström, founder of the Swedish Theatre (Stockholm), in 1854, and died three years after. After her death, her husband married her sister; Louise Granberg, the sister of Jeanette, continued as a playwright and eventually became director of the Swedish Theatre. Jeanette Granberg was considered a great dramatic talent and expected to become one of the greatest within her profession, and her death before the age of 32 was seen as a great loss for her profession.\n\n\n"}

Bernstein, such as qmail, djbdns, daemontools, and ucspi-tcp. Bernstein held the copyright and distributed these works without license until 2007. From December 28, 2007 onwards, he started placing his software in the public domain with an explicit waiver statement.\n\nAdditionally, small scripts are frequently released without specifying a license. For example, the website Userscripts.org hosts more than 52,000 Greasemonkey user scripts, the majority of which have no specified license. Similarly, github reported in 2015 that 85% of the projects it hosts are unlicensed.\n\nOn his Software users' rights web page, Bernstein explains his belief that under the terms of copyright law itself software users are always allowed to modify software for their own personal use, regardless of license agreements. He says '\"If you think you need a license from the copyright holder, you've been bamboozled by Microsoft. As long as you're not distributing the software, you have nothing to worry about.\"\"\n\nHe also says that software users are allowed to back up, to compile, and to run the software that they possess.\n\nHe further says that \"since it's not copyright infringement for you to apply a patch, it's also not copyright infringement for someone to give you a patch,\" noting the case of \"Galoob v. Nintendo\" as precedent. Thus modified versions of license-free software can legally be distributed in source code form in whatever way that the original can, by distributing a patch alongside it.\n\nAdvocates of license-free software, such as Bernstein, argue that software licenses are harmful because they restrict the freedom to use software, and copyright law provides enough freedom without the need for licenses. Though having some restrictions, these licenses allow certain actions that are disallowed by copyright laws in some jurisdictions. If a license tries to restrict an action allowed by a copyright system, by Bernstein's argument those restrictions can be ignored. In fact, Bernstein's \"non-license\" of verbatim retransmission of source code is very similar in nature.\n\nSimilar positions on licenses are voiced by Free culture activist Nina Paley in 2010.\n\nIn 2013 Luis Villa argued similarly negative about the license usage of \"open source\", when the small number projects licensed on GitHub were noticed, identifying a \"Post Open Source movement against the (license) permission culture\".\n\n\n\n"}

She is the former head writer and executive producer of the CBS Daytime soap opera \"The Young and the Restless.\"\n\nBell is married to Bill Bell Jr., the eldest son of \"Y&R\" creators William J. Bell and Lee Phillip Bell. They have two children.\n\nBell began her writing career for \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" in 1988 under writer William J. Bell. There, she helped create the character Sally Spectra who was loosely based on her step-father who worked in the Los Angeles garment industry.\n\nBell later developed primetime shows for NBC and CBS.\n\nBell returned to \"The Young and the Restless\" in November 2007 and was named head writer in March 2008, and co-executive producer in September 2009. She was then elevated to Executive Producer of the series in December 2010.\n\nOn July 25, 2012, a source reported to \"Daytime Confidential\" that Bell's co-head Scott Hamner decided to quit \"Y&R\", and this was later confirmed by \"Soap Opera Digest\" saying that he would take a leave of absence. \"She [Maria Arena Bell] really didn't want me to leave, so I agreed to take a few months off,\" Hamner said. After the news broke, rumors began to circulate that Jill Farren Phelps was close to being named \"Y&R\"'s new executive producer.\n\nTwo days later, Sony Pictures Television reported via a press release that Phelps has been named executive producer and Josh Griffith, who was previously fired by Sony under Bell's tenure, as head writer. Sony thanked Bell for her work and wished her \"the best of luck and continued success\".<ref name=\"Bell Out, Phelps/Griffith In\"></ref>\nOnly hours later, Bell posted a statement on her Facebook page about being ousted, sharing that she was \"mystified\" over being let go by Sony. \"My ratings are strong... each week stronger than last year. The show is in a great place creatively. We are number one by the greatest margin in the show's history and have been consistently while I've been there. Under no one else's tenure as head writer exec producer have we won every demographic for so long. I am just shy of five years at the helm. It has been an amazing ride. So why am I leaving? There have been a lot of tears shed in the last few days... by me and by my loyal staff and by our iconic actors. I was not given a reason and in fact I have heard nothing from Sony or CBS. They sent me a message through my husband Bill, who had the terrible job of conveying that they'd gone around him and were letting me go,\" Bell wrote. Her statement caused angry words from fans, saying that Bell was in denial. An official reason was not given for Bell's departure, though many insiders have speculated that her departure was prompted by Sony's desire to have more \"creative control\" over the number one daytime soap opera and the controversial pairing of Sharon and Victor Newman (Sharon Case and Eric Braeden). Phelps and Griffith's first official episode aired on October 12, 2012, however, Bell was still credited onscreen as executive producer until October 22.\n\nBell was credited, along with former co-executive producer Paul Rauch, for rejuvenating \"The Young and the Restless\" after former head writer and executive producer Lynn Marie Latham was panned by critics for her detour from traditional storytelling and writing characters to suit her storylines. Bell had many successful storylines, including the return of Marge, Katherine Chancellor's look-alike, which resulted in the reveal that Katherine Chancellor was not, in fact, Jill Foster Abbott's mother.\n\nYet soon after, critics became disheartened by Bell's departure from character-driven stories in favor of plot-driven ones, like when Lauren Baldwin (Tracey E. Bregman) was kidnapped out of the blue by the never before seen or mentioned Sarah Smythe (also Bregman), sister of Lauren's long time nemesis Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown). To make matters worse, Sarah had undergone plastic surgery so as to have the same exact face as Lauren, which was a recycled plot twist from the Lynn Marie Latham era when Sheila had undergone plastic surgery to look exactly like Phyllis Newman (Michelle Stafford). This story along with others garnered her comparisons to the late James E. Reilly (\"Passions\" creator/head writer and former head writer of \"Days of Our Lives\") who was known for writing outlandish plots. Bell was criticized for writing numerous bland murder mysteries and killing off popular, long time characters, like Brad Carlton (Don Diamont), Colleen Carlton (Tammin Sursok) and Diane Jenkins (Maura West).\n\nAnother source of contention has been Bell's casting choices. Critics and fans were dissatisfied with the recasting of one of \"Y&R's\" most popular characters and a daytime sex symbol Malcolm Winters (formerly played by Shemar Moore) with former \"Family Matters\" actor Darius McCrary, as well as Eden Riegel's turn as Heather Stevens and Maura West as Diane Jenkins.\n\n\"The Young and the Restless\" writing team won the WGA Award for Best Daytime Serial in February 2010 and again in 2013 for work airing under Bell's tenure. In 2011, Bell, along with her writing team, won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series Writing Team. In December 2012 Bell was honored with the Women's Image Network Humanitarian Award for her contributions to arts and arts education.\n\n\"The Bold and the Beautiful\" (\"credited as Maria Arena\")\n\n\"The Young and the Restless\"\n\n"}
{"id": "34119966", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34119966", "title": "Orange Is the New Black", "text": "Orange Is the New Black\n\nOrange Is the New Black (sometimes abbreviated to OITNB) is an American comedy-drama web television series created by Jenji Kohan for Netflix. The series is based on Piper Kerman's memoir, \"\" (2010), about her experiences at FCI Danbury, a minimum-security federal prison. Produced by Tilted Productions in association with Lionsgate Television, \"Orange Is the New Black\" premiered on Netflix on July 11, 2013. In February 2016, the series was renewed for a fifth, sixth, and seventh season. The sixth season was released on July 27, 2018. On October 17, 2018, it was confirmed that the seventh season would be its last and would be released in 2019.\n\n\"Orange Is the New Black\" has become Netflix's most-watched original series. It has received critical acclaim and many accolades. For its first season, the series garnered 12 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, and Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series, winning three. A new Emmy rule in 2015 forced the series to change categories from comedy to drama. For its second season, the series received four Emmy nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series, and Uzo Aduba won for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series. \"Orange Is the New Black\" is the first series to score Emmy nominations in both comedy and drama categories. The series has also received six Golden Globe Award nominations, six Writers Guild of America Award nominations, a Producers Guild of America Award, an American Film Institute award, and a Peabody Award.\n\nThe series begins revolving around Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling), a woman in her thirties living in New York City who is sentenced to 15 months in Litchfield Penitentiary, a minimum-security women's federal prison in upstate New York. Chapman was convicted of transporting a suitcase full of drug money for her girlfriend Alex Vause (Laura Prepon), an international drug smuggler. The offense had occurred 10 years prior to the start of the series and in that time Piper had moved on to a quiet, law-abiding life among New York's upper middle class. Her sudden and unexpected indictment disrupts her relationships with her fiancé, family and friends. In prison, Chapman is reunited with Vause (who named Chapman in her trial, resulting in Chapman's arrest) and they re-examine their relationship. Simultaneously, Chapman, along with the other inmates, attempt to grapple with prison's numerous, inherent struggles. Episodes often feature flashbacks of significant events from various inmates' and prison guards' pasts. These flashbacks typically depict how an inmate came to be in prison or develop a character's backstory. The prison is initially operated by the \"Federal Department of Corrections\" (a fictional version of the Federal Bureau of Prisons), and was in a later season acquired by the Management & Correction Corporation (MCC), a private prison company.\n\nThe fifth season shows the prisoners revolting against the guards, wardens and the system after MCC's failed handling of an inmate's death at the hands of a guard in the fourth season. The inmate death had followed a peaceful protest and subsequent instigation of an inmate fight by another guard. Fueled by the conditions the inmates are forced to tolerate, as well as grudges against the prison guards, a three-day riot ensues, during which some inmates attempt to negotiate better living conditions and seek justice for the death of the inmate, while others pursue their own interests and entertainment, and a few seek no involvement in the riot. At the emergence of the riot, the guard who incited the fight in the prior season is critically shot by an inmate who took the gun the guard illegally brought into the prison. At the end of the season, SWAT raids the prison to end the riot and remove all inmates from the facility. During this raid, a correctional officer is fatally shot by a corrupt \"strike team\", which then conspires to blame the guard's death on inmates who hid in an underground bunker and had taken hostage of the guard. All inmates are transported to other prisons.\n\nThe consequences of the riot are shown in the sixth season. A number of the inmates, including Chapman and Vause, are transported to Litchfield Maximum Security. Most of these inmates are interrogated, and several of them charged and sentenced for their involvement in the riot. In max, new inmates are introduced, alliances are made, and a gang-like war emerges between two prison blocks, spearheaded by a longstanding feud between two sisters and a grudge harbored by them toward a former maximum-security inmate who returned. Inmates who arrived from the minimum security prison are either caught up or willingly participate in the war between prison blocks. The season portrays further corruption and guard brutality.\n\nThroughout the series, it is shown how various forms of corruption, funding cuts, privatization of prison, overcrowding, guard brutality and racial discrimination, among other issues, affect the prisoners' safety, health and well-being, the correctional officers, and the prison's basic ability to fulfill its fundamental responsibilities and ethical obligations as a corrections institution. One of the show's key conflicts involves the minimum-security prison's Director of Human Activities, Joe Caputo, whose efforts and aims as a warden constantly conflict with the corporate interests of MCC, which acquired the facility when it was about to be shut down.\n\nShow creator Jenji Kohan read Piper Kerman's memoir after a friend sent it to her. She then set up a meeting with Kerman to pitch her on a TV adaptation, which she notes she \"screwed up\" as she spent most of the time asking Kerman about her experiences she described in the book rather than selling her on the show. This appealed to Kerman as it let her know that she was a fan and she signed off on the adaptation. Kohan would later go on to describe the main character, Piper Chapman, as a \"trojan horse\" for the series, allowing it to focus on characters whose demographics would not normally be represented on TV.\n\nIn July 2011, it was revealed that Netflix was in negotiations with Lionsgate for a 13-episode TV adaptation of Kerman's memoirs with Kohan as creator. In November 2011, negotiations were finalized and the series had been greenlit. Kohan had initially wanted to cast Katie Holmes in the role of Piper Chapman, and met with the actress to discuss it, but Holmes had other commitments. Casting announcements began in August 2012 with Taylor Schilling, the first to be cast, as Piper Chapman, followed by Jason Biggs as Piper's fiancé Larry Bloom.\n\nLaura Prepon and Yael Stone were next to join the series, as Alex Vause and Lorna Morello, respectively. Abigail Savage, who plays Gina, and Alysia Reiner, who plays Fig, had auditioned for role of Alex Vause. Prepon initially auditioned for Piper Chapman, however Kohan felt she would not worry about her [in prison], noting a \"toughness and a presence to her that wasn’t right for the character.\" Kohan instead gave her the role of Alex. Stone had originally auditioned for the role of Nicky Nichols, but she was not considered \"tough enough\" for the character; she was asked to audition for Lorna Morello instead. Likability was important for Morello, whom casting director Jen Euston deemed \"a very helpful, nice, sweet Italian girl.\" Natasha Lyonne was to audition for Alex, but was asked to read for the character Nicky Nichols; \"[Kohan knew] she could do Nicky with her eyes closed. She was perfect,\" said Euston. Laverne Cox, a black transgender woman, was cast as Sophia Burset, a transgender character. \"The Advocate\" touted \"Orange Is the New Black\" as possibly the first women-in-prison narrative to cast a transgender woman for this type of role. Uzo Aduba read for the part of Janae Watson but was offered the character Suzanne \"Crazy Eyes\" Warren. Taryn Manning was offered the role of Tiffany \"Pennsatucky\" Doggett. \"This American Life\" host Ira Glass was offered a role as a public radio host, but he declined. The role instead went to Robert Stanton, who plays the fictional host Maury Kind.\n\nThe series is set in a fictional prison in Litchfield, New York, which is a real town in upstate New York, but it does not have a federal penitentiary. The series began filming in the old Rockland Children's Psychiatric Center in Rockland County, New York, on March 7, 2013. The title sequence features photos of real former female prisoners including Kerman herself.\n\nOn June 27, 2013, prior to the series' premiere, Netflix renewed the show for a second season consisting of 13 episodes. For the second season, Uzo Aduba, Taryn Manning, Danielle Brooks, and Natasha Lyonne were promoted to series regulars. Laura Prepon did not return as a series regular for a second season because of scheduling conflicts, but returned for season 3 as a regular. On May 5, 2014, the series was renewed for a third season, as revealed by actress Laura Prepon. For the third season, several actors were promoted to series regulars, including Selenis Leyva, Adrienne C. Moore, Dascha Polanco, Nick Sandow, Yael Stone, and Samira Wiley. Both Jason Biggs and Pablo Schreiber were confirmed as not returning for the third season, but Schreiber appeared in the 10th episode of the third season. The series was renewed for a fourth season on April 15, 2015, prior to its third-season release. For the fourth season, Jackie Cruz and Lea DeLaria were promoted to series regulars; with Elizabeth Rodriguez also being promoted by the season's sixth episode. On February 5, 2016, the series was renewed for a fifth, sixth and seventh season. In season six, Dale Soules, Laura Gómez, and Matt Peters were promoted to series regulars. On October 17, 2018, Netflix announced that the seventh season would be the series' last and would be released in 2019.\n\n\"Orange Is the New Black\" has received critical acclaim. It has been particularly praised for humanizing prisoners and for its depiction of race, sexuality, gender and body types.\n\nThe first season received positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Metacritic gave it a weighted average score of 79 out of 100 based on reviews from 32 critics, indicating favorable reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, season one has a 94% approval rating based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 8.24 out of 10 . The site's critical consensus is \"\"Orange Is the New Black\" is a sharp mix of black humor and dramatic heft, with interesting characters and an intriguing flashback structure.\"\n\nHank Stuever, television critic for \"The Washington Post\", gave \"Orange Is the New Black\" a perfect score. In his review of the series, he stated: \"In Jenji Kohan's magnificent and thoroughly engrossing new series, \"Orange Is the New Black\", prison is still the pits. But it is also filled with the entire range of human emotion and stories, all of which are brought vividly to life in a world where a stick of gum could ignite either a romance or a death threat.\" Maureen Ryan, of \"The Huffington Post\", wrote: \"\"Orange\" is one of the best new programs of the year, and the six episodes I've seen have left me hungry to see more.\"\n\nThe second season also received critical acclaim. Rotten Tomatoes gave a rating of 98%, with an average rating of 9.17 out of 10 based on 45 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: \"With a talented ensemble cast bringing life to a fresh round of serial drama, \"Orange Is the New Black's\" sophomore season lives up to its predecessor's standard for female-led television excellence.\" Metacritic gave the second season a score of 89 out of 100 based on 31 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim.\" David Wiegland of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" gave the season a positive review, calling the first six episodes \"not only as great as the first season, but arguably better.\"\n\nThe third season received critical acclaim.

The site's critical consensus reads: \"\"Orange is the New Black\" is back and better than ever, with a powerful fourth season full of compelling performances by the ensemble cast.\" James Poniewozik of \"The New York Times\" reviewed the fourth season as \"Do you measure the quality of a TV season as a beginning-to-end average or by how well it ends? By the first yardstick, Season 4 is ambitious but uneven; by the latter, it's the series' best.\"\n\nThe fifth season received \"generally favorable reviews\". On Metacritic, it has a score of 67 out of 100 based on 20 reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 73% rating with an average score of 7.19 out of 10 based on 41 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: \"\"Orange Is the New Black\"s fifth season offers up more of the sharp writing and dizzying tonal juggling acts that fans expect – albeit somewhat less successfully.\"\n\nThe sixth season received positive reviews from critics, with many critics noting its improvement over the previous season. On Metacritic, it has a score of 69 out of 100 based on 14 reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an 84% rating with an average score of 7.3 out of 10 based on 32 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Brutality and humor continue to mesh effectively in a season of \"Orange Is the New Black\" that stands as a marked improvement from its predecessor, even if some arcs are more inspired than others.\"\n\n\"Orange Is the New Black\" has received many accolades since its debut. The series has garnered 16 Emmy Award nominations and four wins. For its first season, it received 12 Emmy Award nominations, including Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, and Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series, winning three. Taylor Schilling received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Television Series – Drama. In 2013, the American Film Institute selected the series as one of the Top 10 Television Programs of the Year.\n\nA new Emmy rule in 2015, classifying half-hour shows as comedies and hour-long shows as dramas, forced the series to change categories from comedy to drama for its second season. That year, the series received four Emmy nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series, and Aduba won her second Emmy Award, for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series. \"Orange Is the New Black\" became the first series to receive Emmy nominations in both comedy and drama categories. For its second season, the series also received three Golden Globe Award nominations: Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy, Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy for Schilling, and Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film for Aduba. At the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards, the series won Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series and Aduba won Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series.\n\nFor its third season, \"Orange Is the New Black\" won Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series (Aduba). It received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy. The series has also received, among other accolades, six Writers Guild of America Award nominations, five Satellite Awards, four Critics' Choice Television Awards, a GLAAD Media Award, an American Cinema Editors Award, a Producers Guild of America Award, and a Peabody Award.\n\nThe series began airing on broadcast television in New Zealand on TV2 on August 19, 2013. It premiered in Australia on October 9, 2013, on Showcase. The second season began on Showcase on July 16, 2014, and the third season premiered on June 11, 2015. The first season began airing on broadcast television in the UK on Sony Channel from April 19, 2017.\n\nIn April 2017, it was reported that a cybercriminal had stolen the first ten episodes of the fifth season in a security breach of a post-production company. Netflix failed to respond to ransom demands, and the cybercriminal leaked the episodes online. Netflix confirmed the security breach and an ongoing investigation by federal law enforcement. \"Multichannel News\" reported that demand for the series significantly increased over the seven-day period following the leak of the episodes. It was also said that the leak would likely cause a decrease in demand for the fifth season when Netflix releases it in June.\n\n\"Orange Is the New Black\" generated more viewers and hours viewed in its first week than the other top Netflix original series \"House of Cards\" and \"Arrested Development\". In October 2013, Netflix stated that the show is a \"tremendous success\" for the streaming platform. \"It will end the year as our most watched original series ever and, as with each of our other previously launched originals, enjoys an audience comparable with successful shows on cable and broadcast TV.\" As reported in February 2016, \"Orange Is the New Black\" remains Netflix's most-watched original series. In 2016, a \"New York Times\" study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that \"Orange Is the New Black\" is one of the shows most watched in urban areas, and despite its \"minority-rich ensemble cast,\" the series \"appeals more to a white audience.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Established in 1996, the network consists of 53 festivals in the Ottawa region.\n\nIn the summer of 1994, four new festivals evolved with the objective of showcasing different cultures, arts, and entertainment to the local community. Distinct, yet sharing a common objective, these organizations, namely, Ottawa Bluesfest, CKCU Ottawa Folk Festival, Ottawa Chamber Music Festival, and Fete Caribe, saw a unique opportunity to exchange ideas and experiences and to lend support in each other’s development and growth.\n\nIn the fall of 1994, a meeting was called by the president of Ottawa Tourism Commission Authority (OTCA) in response to many public inquiries relating to these new festivals. The goal was to create a communication flow between the festivals and OTCA. During this meeting, there was a consensus that most of the festivals had many common interests and that there was a need to form some ongoing group that could not only coordinate tourism information, but also share ideas to improve their individual events.\nAfter many meetings and brainstorming sessions, the Ottawa Festival Network was formed with an initial board which included prominent personalities like Mark Monahan (Ottawa Bluesfest), Michel Gauthier (Canadian Tulip Festival), Gene Swimmer (Ottawa Folk Festival) and Christine Broughton (OTCA). It was from this initial group that the network flourished and eventually, was successful in liaising with several organizations, such as, Canadian Tourism Commission, City of Ottawa, and Human Resource Development Canada, to name a few.\nIn April, 1996 the Ottawa Festival Network became an incorporated entity with a group of diverse not-for-profit member festivals representing different cultures, arts, and entertainment.\nApril 2006 brought a landmark when the Ottawa Festival Network celebrated its 10th Anniversary with the “Launch of the Festival Season”. This event brought celebrated Ottawa’s multi-million dollar festival industry and the decade-long involvement of the Ottawa Festival Network in showcasing and promoting art, culture and entertainment in Canada’s National Capital Region. This event presented the unveiling of the new official name (Ottawa Festivals d’Ottawa), the logo, the 10th anniversary brochure, and the new and revised official Web site. The launch highlighted the growth of the festival industry over the past decade and how it has contributed to the local tourism and economy.\n\n2. http://www.ottawafestivals.ca/ottawa-411/\n\n3. http://www.ottawafestivals.ca/ottawa-411/other-things-to-do/\n\n"}

Active for five decades, much of his work was architectural in style.\n\nBorn in Paris in 1930, after high school Clayette attended the Académie Julian where he studied under Jules Cavaillès. On leaving the Académie he was recruited by Cassandre to work in his studio. Clayette's first known professional work was in the mid 1950s. From 1960 he explored a different artistic theme each year, exhibiting virtually continuously each year successively until the early 1990s at the Galerie Charpentier, the Galerie Roger Dulac, the Galerie Emmanuel David and the Galerie Proscenium. At the same time, he collaborated with the magazine \"Planète\" as a draftsman, and illustrated the covers or the text of books including the works of Shakespeare (including the series New Penguin Shakespeare), Goethe, Rimbaud, Kafka, etc. In the early 1960s dramatist Jean Anouilh introduced Clayette to the stage actor and director Jean Le Poulain as \"A painter of the waking dream\".\n\nFor \"Planète\" he illustrated the poems of Victor Hugo; he also illustrated the works of H. P. Lovecraft and Jorge Luis Borges in the Fantasy Realism style. However, like many artists who at one point in their career were associated with the movement such as Pierre-Yves Trémois, Clayette's pictorial production did not stop at the themes of Fantasy Realism. Although the unusual is a constant of his work, it draws its references in many artistic currents including Romanticism, Baroque, Symbolism, etc.\n\nClayette died in Colombes in France in 2005 aged 75.\n\n\n\nBy his own admission, Pierre Clayette was interested in scenography and theater design before even considering painting. The influence of Cassandre is evident in an artist who was one of the last representatives of the period between the 1920s and the late 1970s during which theater and opera directors often appeal to leading artists in the world of painting. As such, Clayette is part of a lineage that included, among others, André Derain, Balthus, Christian Berard, George Wakhevich, Cassandre and Andre Masson. Clayette entered the world of scenography in 1955 for a ballet by Daniel Wayenberg with Pierre Lacotte who entrusted him with his first set of sets. Clayette became famous among the great names of lyric and dramatic scenes, such as Maurice Béjart, Pierre Lacotte, Gabriel Dussurget, Maurice Escande and Jean Le Poulain, maintaining a long involvement with the latter until Poulain's death in 1988. Clayette's talent as a stage designer gave him the opportunity to express himself on the most prestigious stages, such as the Comédie-Française, the Palais Garnier and the International Festival of Lyric Art in Aix-en-Provence.\n\n\n\"The Treasure of the Dutch\" - sets by André François and Pierre Clayette (1969)\n\n\n\n\n"}

As is traditional in some English-speaking countries, when a child loses a tooth it is customary for him or her to place it under the pillow, so that Ratoncito Pérez will exchange it for a gift. The tradition is almost universal in Spanish cultures, but takes different forms in different areas. He is known as \"Ratoncito Pérez\" in Spanish speaking countries, with the exception of some regions of Mexico, Guatemala, Peru and Chile, where he is called \"el Ratón de los Dientes\" (The Tooth Mouse), and in Argentina, Venezuela, Uruguay and Colombia, he is known simply as \"El Ratón Pérez\".\n\nSimilarly in the Philippines, some Christian ethnic groups have the same allusion of a rat when they lose the teeth. However, unlike in the hispanic countries, the rat is not named.\n\nThe \"Ratoncito Pérez\" has been used in by Colgate marketing in Venezuela, stars in the 2006 Argentine movie El Ratón Pérez, and appeared in the tale of the Vain Little Mouse.\n\nA mouse named \"Ratón Pérez\" or \"ratonpérez\" or \"ratompérez\" first appeared in \"Cuentos, oraciones, adivinanzas y refranes populares\" (1877), by Fernán Caballero, the pen name of Cecilia Böhl de Faber y Larrea, in \"La hormiguita\" as her gentle and timid husband, as well as the husband of \"La Ratita Presumida\" (The Vain Little Mouse). This character would later inspire Luis Coloma, who would make him part of the Spanish traditional folklore by turning him into a sort of Tooth Fairy.\n\nIn 1894, Coloma was contracted to write a story for Alfonso XIII, who had just lost his tooth at the age of 8. Coloma's story follows \"Ratoncito Pérez\" who lived with his family in a box of cookies in Madrid, but frequently ran away from home through the pipes of the city, and into the bedrooms of children who had lost their teeth. The story details how Ratoncito Pérez cunningly misleads any cats in the vicinity who may be lurking, and includes his interaction with King Buby (Queen Maria Christina's nickname for Alfonso XIII).\n\nThe city council of Madrid paid tribute to Ratoncito Pérez with a commemorative plaque outside the warehouse where the mouse was said to have lived. The plaque reads: \"Here lived, in a box of cookies, Ratoncito Pérez, according to the story that the father Coloma wrote for the young King Alfonso XIII.\" Ratoncito Pérez thus became the first fictional character honored with a plaque by the Madrid City Council. Coloma's original manuscript, with his signature and a dedication to King Alfonso XIII, is now located in the vault of the Royal Palace Library.\n\nColoma's original story has been retold and adapted in various formats since it was published in the early 1900s. One such retelling was by Lady Moreton entitled \"Perez the Mouse\", which she published in 1915 and attributed to Coloma.\n\nIn 2006, the story was filmed under the title \"El Ratón Pérez\" (or \"Perez, the mouse of your dreams\"), directed by Juan Pablo Buscarini. The \"Ratoncito Pérez\" has been used in Colgate marketing in Venezuela, and the character appeared earlier in the tale of the Vain Little Mouse.\n\nOther adaptations include \"El ratoncito Pérez\" by Olga Lecaye (1999), \"La mágica historia del Ratoncito Pérez\" by Fidel del Castillo (1996), \"¡S.O.S., salvad al ratoncito Pérez!\" by Eduardo Galán (1995), and \"Ratoncito Pérez, en Vuelo de Cometas\" by Vicenta Fernández Martín (1999).\n\nRaton Perez makes an appearance in DreamWorks Animation's film \"Rise of the Guardians\", when one of the Tooth Fairy's mini fairies finds him at works and tackles him before the Tooth Fairy stops the fight\n\nHandy Manny episode \"Julieta's Tooth\" makes mention of \"Mr. Perez\" among other nicknames for the \"tooth Mouse\" to take her tooth after Manny retrieves it from the sink trap.\n\n\n\n"}

The script coordinator is responsible for producing each draft of the script and annotating it for ease of use for the production team.\n\nOn a television series the script coordinator is responsible for liaising between the writing and production departments. The writers deliver the first draft of a script to the script coordinator who prepares it for the production team and handles any clearance issues. Clearance refers to the need to check the script for potential legal problems and ensure that all names are cleared by the legal department. \n\nThe script coordinator must check the draft for proper formatting, spelling, punctuation and continuity before releasing the draft. Once a script has been released, other members of the production team offer notes to the writers necessitating revisions to the script. The process of how widely each draft is released (e.g. just to the writers, then to the writers and producers and then to the network) varies from show to show. \n\nWith each round of revisions the script coordinator must ensure that the changes are clearly marked, re-issue the script and again check the script for errors. Many script coordinators are also responsible for foreign language translations and compiling a show bible that tracks plot points and character introductions as a reference tool. \n\nA script coordinator is a distinct role from script supervisor. A script supervisor is responsible for on-set annotation of the script for editing purposes rather than pre-production coordination of the script to facilitate production.

The film follows a group of shopgirls working in Bunting and Hobbs, a London department store, during the Christmas shopping season. It was released in the U.S. under the title Shop Spoiled.\n\nThe Christmas holidays are approaching, and a group of shopgirls head to their jobs at Bunting and Hobbs, a busy London department store. Peggy French (Joan Rice) is upset at her shopman fiance, Leslie Randall (John Gregson), because he refuses to sell his vintage car, \"Bessie\", that takes up all of his time and money. Peggy notes that he went to a car club meeting the previous night instead of taking her on a date, that he spends on the car instead of saving so they can get married, and that he has not even bought her an engagement ring. As they head into their respective jobs in the furnishings and estates departments, they quarrel and Peggy breaks off their engagement. She also refuses to let Leslie take her to the staff Christmas party that night, and leads him to believe that she has been dating the kind but very proper personnel manager, Philip Stanton (Cyril Raymond). In reality, although Mr Stanton is charmed by Peggy, he is not interested in fraternizing with any of the shopgirls as that is improper for a manager and could cost him his job. \n\nLeslie attempts to win Peggy back, but his efforts get him reported by Peggy's supervisor Mr Preedy, who has been making romantic overtures to Peggy despite being a married man, and sees Leslie as unwelcome competition for her affections. Leslie also gets reported by his own supervisor after Leslie botches his assignment of showing a house to friends of the store owner, Mr Bunting, because he is distracted by trying to make up with Peggy. Mr Stanton, looking through Leslie's personnel file, sees a report he wrote about promotions and thinks he might transfer Leslie to a higher-paying position in the publicity department. Mr Stanton also gives Leslie's report to Mr Bunting, saying it contains new and useful ideas. Leslie later informs Mr Stanton that he took the ideas for the report out of a book written by Mr Bunting, causing Mr Stanton to worry that he himself will now be sacked for repeating Mr Bunting's own ideas back to him. \n\nAnother shopgirl, Yvonne Pascoe (Josephine Griffin), is worried and ill at work. She tells Peggy that she urgently needs to get in touch with her fiance, Michael Blayburn, who left his mother's home two months ago to look for a job so that he could marry Yvonne. Yvonne has not heard from Michael since he left, and when she tries to telephone his wealthy mother to find out his whereabouts, she is rebuffed. Peggy suggests Yvonne go visit Mrs Blayburn at her home during Yvonne's noontime break from the cosmetics counter. Yvonne does this, but Mrs Blayburn is cold to her and tells her Michael is tired of her and doesn't want to see her or hear from her. When Yvonne confesses she is pregnant with Michael's baby, Mrs Blayburn becomes angry, calls her a \"slut\" and orders her out of the house. Yvonne is late getting back to work and is reported by Moira, who is annoyed at having to work all alone at the busy cosmetics counter. Mr Stanton meets with Yvonne, learns she is pregnant, and tells her she will have to stop working, although she can have her job back after the baby is born and put up for adoption. He suggests Yvonne visit the welfare office in the meantime, since she has no other family to turn to. Yvonne returns to the cosmetics counter, where she pockets a prescription intended for a customer that contains strychnine and leaves the store. In her hurry to leave, she fails to take an urgent note that a young man left for her at the counter; the note falls on the floor and is trampled by shoppers.\n\nAt the staff Christmas party that night, Peggy tries to attach herself to Mr Stanton, interrupting his efforts to socialize with Mr Bunting's homely daughter. Leslie then appears and Mr Bunting calls him over and praises him on his fine report, putting Leslie on track for the well-paying publicity department job. Leslie pays Peggy back for her deception by telling Mr Bunting that he heard Peggy and Mr Stanton were engaged, causing Mr Bunting's daughter to burst into tears. After the party, Peggy learns that Leslie has sold his old car, thus proving that he cares more about her than the car. She happily reunites with him, only to find he has bought an even older car. \n\nMeanwhile, shopgirl Suzy (Vera Day), who dreams of being a film actress, is seduced after the party by her date, a chauffeur who has pretended to be a director and promised her a screen test. Alice, another shopgirl who could not get a date for the party, hires a paid male escort, only to have him tell her at the end of the evening he enjoyed going out with her and the date is free of charge. Eve Carter, a beautiful but mysterious model at the store, is shown to be secretly happily married to (and, it is implied, financially supporting) a wheelchair-bound man. She hides her marriage by taking off her wedding ring at work so she will not lose her job. \n\nYvonne does not attend the party, but wanders the dark streets of London contemplating suicide. At one point she orders tea from a stall and starts to take the strychnine pills, but is interrupted by the menacing sexual advances of a male customer at the stall. He chases her through the streets until she finally escapes into a church, where she collapses in tears, but decides not to kill herself. As she walks home past Bunting and Hobbs, she throws the pills into a waste bin. The next morning, the watchman (Sid James) finds the note that Yvonne never received, crumpled on the floor. It is from Michael, telling Yvonne that he has got a job, asking her to marry him and saying he will call her the next day.\n\nShopgirls:\nShopmen:\nCustomers: \nOthers: \nIn the mid-1950s, Adelphi Films productions were usually considered 'B' pictures that were booked by theatres only as support for main features, or at selected provincial locations. Founder Arthur Dent planned \"The Crowded Day\" as a high-quality big-budget feature in hopes of convincing theatres, particularly the Odeon Cinemas and ABC Cinemas, to book the film nationwide throughout the UK as a main feature ('A' picture). To that end, Adelphi subcontracted the popular stars John Gregson and Joan Rice from the Rank Organisation at significant expense, and invested in other aspects of the film.\n\nThe film was shot at Nettlefold Studios and on location in London. The Oxford Street department store Bourne & Hollingsworth (renamed \"Bunton and Hobbs\" for the film) was the setting for the exterior store shots, and also some interior shots as producer David Dent arranged one day's shooting at the store for free. The Tower House was used for exterior shots of Mrs Blayburn's mansion. The exterior and interior church scenes were filmed at St Stephen's Church, Westbourne Park.\n\nThe film's target audience was women. The storyline involving Yvonne, the unmarried, pregnant shopgirl who contemplates suicide, was considered risque for its time, causing the film to be advertised as \"not suitable for children\".\n\n\"The Crowded Day\" marked the first production in which Sid James and Vera Day both appeared. The two would appear together in many more film and television productions over the next decade.\n\nAccording to British Film Institute (BFI) fiction film curator Vic Pratt, critics were generally \"impressed\" with the film, especially with Guillermin's direction, although some \"smirked\" at the film's handling of the unwed pregnancy and suicide storyline. However, both Odeon and ABC refused to book it as a first feature due to conflicts with Arthur Dent. In November 1954 it was partially released at a small number of Odeons, but lacking a full circuit release, was unable to recoup its costs.\n\nIn February 2011, BFI Video released \"The Crowded Day\" on DVD and Blu-ray, along with the Guillermin-directed film \"Song of Paris\", as \"Adelphi Collection Vol. 3\".\n"}

Built in 1888 as a bank, later mayor Orange Phelps converted the property into a theater in 1911 and in 1925 converted it into a two-story Italianate building with a larger auditorium. Prior to renovation the theater was owned by the city of Hillsboro who purchased it from Act III Theatres. The theatre has been temporarily closed since mid-April 2017 in connection with a planned change of ownership. However, that sale fell through, and the theater and restaurant remain closed in August 2017. In late August, its owner told the \"Hillsboro Tribune\" that he had found a new buyer, but it is not known when the Venetian might reopen.\n\nIn 1888, banker John W. Shute built a two-story building on East Main Street as the new home for the First National Bank of Hillsboro. The structure featured a façade in the Italianate style of architecture, external cast iron ornamentation, and a roof line with a bracketed cornice. In 1911, the bank moved across Main Street and later mayor Orange Phelps purchased the building. Although Phelps did not have the money to buy the building, the bank loaned him the funds and he opened The Grand Theater, a 200-seat theater. The wide by long theater was expanded in 1915 to 500 seats and named the Liberty Theater.\n\nIn 1925, a fire destroyed the theater and Phelps rebuilt the structure and named the new theater The Venetian. The first motion picture with sound shown in Hillsboro was \"The Broadway Melody\" in 1929 at the theater. Beginning in 1935 Phelps held an annual free show for children at Christmas which continued into the 1990s. In 1956, a fire gutted the building, with Phelps rebuilding and opening the following year as the 800-plus seat Town Theater. After the fire Phelps had held double features at his Town Theater. In 1961, the theater hosted the premiere of the film \"Ring of Fire\", which had been filmed in Vernonia, Oregon. Phelps owned the theater along with several other theaters in Washington County into the 1970s. Tom Moyer Theaters purchased Phelps’ theaters in 1978 and in turn sold all of that theater chain’s screens to Act III Theatres in 1989. In 1996, Act III closed the theater and sold the building to the city for $1,500.\n\nAfter purchasing the property the city proposed several redevelopment ideas for the building, including selling it to the McMenamins brewpub chain for a theater and pub. In 2001, Hillsboro purchased the adjoining building (home to Music Village at the time) for $160,000 to add to the property to be used for any redevelopment of the theater. The city solicited ideas for the redevelopment of the building in early 2007. While under city ownership the space was briefly used as storage for the Hillsboro Farmers’ Market and faced possible demolition as estimates for the cost to renovate the structure continually increased.\nIn August 2007, the city sold the building to developer Denzil Scheller for $10 and gave him $750,000 to assist in the renovation of the deteriorating building. Scheller spent $2.5 million to renovate the space and bring the building up to modern fire, earthquake, and disability access codes. Of this $2.5 million, around $1.5 million came from his own funds, and the remainder came from city funds along with $250,000 from Metro in the conversion of the space into a theater, meeting space, restaurant, and live event venue. Work included gutting the building to rebuild the support structure, removing asbestos, and opening a wall into the adjacent Music Village building. Local architectural firm Partin and Hill Architects designed the renovations.\n\nScheller renamed the theater as The Venetian, returning to the former name, with the distinct yellow marquee of the Town Theater removed in September 2007. The re-opening of the theater is part of the city’s plan to create a regional arts center in the downtown core and attract more people after 5:00 p.m. when county and city offices close. On July 9, 2008, the new The Venetian Theatre and Bistro opened with the theater portion opening on July 11. In September 2008, Bag & Baggage Productions became the resident theater company at the theater and opened their new season with \"Steel Magnolias\". In October 2010, the renovation of the theater was awarded the Outstanding Achievement in Design award from the Oregon Main Street organization.\n\nIn early 2017, owner Denzil Scheller reported that he had reached a tentative agreement to sell the theater to a buyer who, for now, wished to remain anonymous. The theater would close at the end of the day on April 13, temporarily, while the sale was finalized, to reopen at an unknown date. The theater remained closed as of August 2017, and the \"Hillsboro Tribune\" reported that the planned sale earlier in the year had fallen through, with owner Scheller saying the buyer had \"disappeared\" without explanation just before completing the purchase. In late August, Scheller told the \"Tribune\" that he had found a new buyer, but without revealing any additional details.\n\nLocated in downtown Hillsboro on Main Street between Second and Third avenues, the theater is one block north of the Hillsboro Central MAX light rail station. The space includes a 370-seat theater, and a restaurant with an upstairs balcony. The balcony sits above Main Street and has roll-up windows. On the exterior are decorative terra cotta urns and red colored roof tiles on Main Street. Designed to encourage late night patronage of the downtown area, the theater is a centerpiece of revitalization efforts of that part of Hillsboro.\n\nThe current building is a multi-use facility that includes a theater and restaurant. The theater exhibits movies, presents live performances, is a live music venue, and can be used as meeting space. The casual dining restaurant features a European menu with items including pizza, soup, sandwiches, and hamburgers, all of which can be eaten in the theater.\n\n"}
