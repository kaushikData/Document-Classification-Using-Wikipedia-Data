{"id": "1538357", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1538357", "title": "Ahab the Arab", "text": "Ahab the Arab\n\n\"Ahab the Arab\" is a novelty song written and recorded by Ray Stevens in 1962. In the song, Arab is pronounced \"Ay-rab\" to rhyme with Ahab. The hero of the story is Clyde the camel and Stevens has made references to Clyde numerous times throughout his career.\n\nIt followed \"Jeremiah Peabody's Polyunsaturated Quick-Dissolving Fast-Acting Pleasant-Tasting Green and Purple Pills\", becoming his second top 40 hit. It reached number five on Billboard's Hot 100 and number nine on the Billboard R&B chart. It remains one of the best-selling records of Stevens' career. Stevens has recorded the song at least three times and there have also been edited versions.\n\nThe song portrays a \"sheik of the burning sands\" named Ahab. He is highly decorated with jewelry, and every night he hops on his camel named Clyde on his way to see Fatima, who is the best dancer in the Sultan's harem. Fatima is described with a modified quote from the 1909 hit, \"I've Got Rings On My Fingers\": \"with rings on her fingers and bells on her toes and a bone in her nose, ho ho\". During the ride, Ahab \"speaks\" (actually, produces ululations that parody the Arabic language) to Clyde. (A later version adds the advertising catch phrase \"Sold, American!\" to the end of one chant. This is perhaps due to a Kinky Friedman (famous for the song and album \"Sold American\") cover version which also added those lines). The phrase was also well known to Americans from the commercials for radio's popular \"The Jack Benny Program\", sponsored by Lucky Strike cigarettes. The program began and ended with two tobacco auctioneers rattling off prices in a rapid-fire similar to Stevens' delivery, ending with \"Sold American!\"\n\nWhen Ahab finds Fatima in her tent, she is ironically engaged in stereotypically Western behavior: \"eating on a raisin, and a grape, and an apricot, and a pomegranate, a bowl of chittlins, two bananas, three Hershey bars, and \nsipping on an RC Cola, and eating a Moon Pie, listenin' to her transistor, watchin' the Grand Ole Opry, and readin' \"Mad Magazine\" while she sung, 'Does your chewing gum lose\nits flavor?'\" Ahab woos Fatima with another mock Arabic chant, this time a quote from the song \"Let's Twist Again\" by Chubby Checker. Fatima (portrayed by Stevens in falsetto) responds to Ahab's advances with laughter and an (English) utterance that Ahab is \"crazy\".\n\nAhab loves Fatima, which apparently does not sit too well with the Sultan, whose appearance prompts an escape attempt, which does succeed, because Clyde was the fastest camel in the desert, and they \"lived happily ever after\" (the original single version was edited and does not mention the escape attempt at all, instead ending the song with Fatima saying, \"Crazy, baby!\").\n\nAlong with \"The Streak\", it was one of Stevens' biggest hits and contributed greatly to his popularity. It reached number 5 on the Billboard top 40 during July 1962.\n\nA later song by Stevens, a Christmas novelty number called \"Santa Claus Is Watching You\", features a \"cameo\" by Clyde. The intrepid camel is pressed into service in place of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (in different recordings of the song, the famous reindeer's reason for being absent alternates between \"He's at a stakeout at your house\" or being \"all stove up in the hospital\" after injuring himself during \"a twist contest\"). The song also repeats the \"Ahab the Arab\" schtick of reciting a random list of objects, in this case gifts for \"all the good little girls and boys.\"\n\nStevens has said that Clyde the camel was named after rhythm-and-blues singer Clyde McPhatter, formerly the lead singer of The Drifters. Clyde is arguably the most memorable character of the song, due to Stevens' exaggerated imitation of a camel's braying vocalization. Clyde has become something of a mascot for Stevens, and for several years in the late 1990s and early 2000s the artist released albums and video entertainment under the label Clyde Records (complete with camel-shaped logo). Clyde Records continues to be the outlet for a lot of contemporary material from Stevens.\n\nStevens' music publishing company was once named Ahab Music Inc. before he changed its name in 1977 to Ray Stevens Music. His publishing company is affiliated with BMI.\n\n"}

She is known for her biographical film roles, most notably her performance as Tina Turner in the biopic \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" (1993), for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress and won a corresponding Golden Globe Award. Bassett has additionally portrayed Betty Shabazz in both \"Malcolm X\" (1992) and \"Panther\" (1995), Katherine Jackson in \"\" (1992), Voletta Wallace in \"Notorious\" (2009), and Coretta Scott King in \"Betty & Coretta\" (2013). Her other roles include Amanda Waller in \"Green Lantern\" (2011), Lynne Jacobs in \"Olympus Has Fallen\" (2013) and \"London Has Fallen\" (2016), and Queen Ramonda in \"Black Panther\" (2018).\n\nBassett began her film career in the mid-1980s, after earning a bachelor of arts degree from Yale University and a master of fine arts degree from drama school. In the 1990s, she appeared in films nearly every year. The 2000s saw a succession of films starring Bassett, with her appearing in at least one film every year. Bassett's success has continued into the 2010s. Bassett earned nominations for her roles in films such as \"The Score\" (2001), \"Akeelah and the Bee\" (2006), \"Meet the Browns\" (2008) and \"Jumping the Broom\" (2011), and won awards for her performances in \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\" (1998) and \"Music of the Heart\" (1999), among others. Bassett's performance as Rosa Parks in the 2002 film \"The Rosa Parks Story\" was honored with her first Primetime Emmy Award nomination.\n\nIn 2013, Bassett had a recurring role on the FX horror anthology series \"\", earning her second Primetime Emmy Award nomination for her performance as Voodoo queen Marie Laveau. She returned for \"\", the series' fourth season, portraying a three-breasted woman named Desiree Dupree, for which she received another Emmy Award nomination. For the fifth season, \"Hotel\", she portrayed Ramona Royale, a famous movie star. Bassett returned to the series's sixth cycle, \"\", portraying an alcoholic actress named Monet Tumusiime, who plays struggling mother and former police officer Lee Harris in the \"My Roanoke Nightmare\" documentary, and she reprised her role as Marie Laveau in a guest role in the eighth season \"\". In 2018, Bassett began producing and starring in the Fox first responder drama series \"9-1-1\", playing LAPD patrol sergeant Athena Grant.\n\nBassett was born on August 16, 1958 in New York City, the daughter of Betty Jane (née Gilbert; 1935–2014) and Daniel Benjamin Bassett (1924–1981), and was raised in Harlem. Bassett's middle name was given to her in honor of her aunt Evelyn. The origin of the Bassett surname comes from her ancestor William Henry Bassett, who took the surname of his former oppressor. Ten months after Bassett was born, her mother became pregnant and had a second child, Bassett's sister D'nette. Bassett said the pregnancy \"only made things harder.\" Bassett's parents \"shipped\" her to stay with her father's sister Golden. While her aunt did not have any children of her own, she \"loved children, and she was good with them.\"\n\nAfter her parents' separation, she relocated from Winston-Salem, North Carolina to St. Petersburg, Florida, where she and her sister D'nette were raised by their social worker/civil servant mother. Bassett did not see her father again for several years, until she attended her grandmother's funeral. There, Bassett met his daughter from his first marriage, Jean, who at twelve years old, was several years older than Bassett. After graduating from Jordan Park Elementary School, she began being bused out of her neighborhood to attend Disston Middle School for seventh grade. The year she began attending was 1970, the first year busing was implemented to integrate public schools in St. Petersburg. After completing seventh grade, she was bused to Azalea Middle School for eighth and ninth grade. Bassett's mother became more involved in her daughter's grades and told her and her sister the pair were going to college.\n\nIn her younger years, Bassett was \"in love\" with the Jackson 5 and dreamed of marrying a member of the family group, stating it would probably be \"whoever had the cutest, roundest Afro at the time. In my imagination we would have children and live in a real house.\" As her interest in entertainment developed, Angela and her sister would often put on shows, reading poems or performing popular music for their family.\nAt Boca Ciega High School, Bassett was a cheerleader and a member of the Upward Bound college prep program, the debate team, student government, drama club and choir. A straight \"A\" and \"B\" student for the most part, Bassett got her first \"C,\" in physical education, and tried to get her mother to not feel disappointment in the grade. Bassett called the grade the \"average,\" leading her mother to say that she did not have \"average kids.\" As Bassett described, a \"sense of pride\" developed in her and she did not get another \"C\" until college. During high school, Bassett became the first African-American from Boca Ciega to be admitted to the National Honor Society. She participated in Upward Bound, an academic and cultural enrichment program for underprivileged students. Bassett says she and the other participants did not see themselves as underprivileged.\n\nBassett attended Yale University and received her B.A. degree in African-American studies in 1980. In 1983, she earned a Master of Fine Arts degree from the Yale School of Drama, despite opposition from her father's sister who warned her to not \"waste\" her \"Yale education on theater.\" She was the only member of Bassett's family to have gone to both college and graduate school. At Yale, Bassett met her future husband Courtney B. Vance, a 1986 graduate of the drama school. Bassett was also classmates with actor Charles S. Dutton.\n\nAfter graduation, Bassett worked as a receptionist for a beauty salon and as a photo researcher. Bassett soon looked for acting work in the New York theater. One of her first New York performances came in 1985 when she appeared in J. E. Franklin's \"Black Girl\" at Second Stage Theatre. She appeared in two August Wilson plays at the Yale Repertory Theatre under the direction of her long-time instructor Lloyd Richards. The Wilson plays featuring Bassett were \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom\" (1984) and \"Joe Turner's Come and Gone\" (1986). In 2006, she had the opportunity to work on the Wilson canon again, starring in \"Fences\" alongside longtime collaborator Laurence Fishburne at the Pasadena Playhouse in California.\n\nIn 2018, Basset was awarded an honorary doctoral degree in fine arts from her alma mater, Yale University.\n\nIn 1985, Bassett made her first television appearance as a prostitute in the TV movie \"Doubletake\". She made her film debut as a news reporter in \"F/X\" (1986), for which she was required to join the Screen Actors Guild (SAG). Bassett moved to Los Angeles in 1988 for more acting jobs and gained recognition in the films \"Boyz n the Hood\" (1991) and \"Malcolm X\" (1992). For her portrayal of Betty Shabazz, she earned an Image Award. Despite the award, the movie was not entirely given positive reception, being referred to by critics as failing to \"capture\" the rage of Malcolm X's autobiography. During production of \"Malcolm X\", Spike Lee showed Bassett a tape of the exact moment when Malcolm X was shot during his assassination, since they would be filming the scene. Bassett called the recording \"haunting\", but noted that after listening, she was \"able to grab hold of the pain and re-create the scene.\" Bassett felt it was important for her to get the assassination scene correct, and wondered how Betty \"found the strength to keep going, to raise her family, to educate, to sustain them.\" \"Malcolm X\" was released on November 18, 1992.\n\nIn 1992, Bassett played Katherine Jackson in \"\". Bassett's agents tried to discourage her from playing the role, given the negative reception that Michael Jackson had. She admitted to not caring about the negative view of members of the Jackson family at the time, citing her childhood fondness of the group as an example of her passion for the project and believed her \"instinct\" about the role had been correct once learning of the positive reviews the miniseries received after airing. Bassett had previously idolized the group growing up and said the Jackson family were positive influences on the African-American community for their successes. Bassett had previously worried that after her role as Betty Shabazz in \"Malcolm X\", she would not find another role \"as satisfying\". Bassett at the time of the film's release expressed her belief that her career would never receive such high-profile roles again. \"I think I have been incredibly blessed and it is probably just all downhill from here.\"\n\nLater that year, Bassett was cast as Tina Turner in \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" (1993). Bassett returned to Los Angeles after \"Malcolm X\" filming was completed, and got a call for an audition for a movie based on \"I, Tina\", Tina Turner's memoir. Bassett won a Golden Globe and earned an Academy Award nomination for her portrayal of Turner. She was the first African-American to win the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Bassett obtained the role after beating Halle Berry and Robin Givens, but only had a month to prepare before filming began. She met Tina Turner twice, and was given advice by the woman she would be portraying from wigs and outfits to dancing styles. Turner also did Bassett's make up, leading Bassett to call her \"supportive\" and her \"biggest fan.\" Bassett described to the \"Orlando Sentinel\" going to one of Turner's concerts and crying profusely. According to Bassett, upon realizing that she knew some of Turner's dance moves, she was \"almost a river of tears.\" Marc Bernardin of \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote that Bassett \"gave the performance of a lifetime\" portraying Turner in the biopic.\n\nBassett starred in three movies in 1995, which were released with varied reactions from critics: \"Vampire in Brooklyn\", \"Strange Days\", and \"Waiting to Exhale\" (where she worked with author Terry McMillan). In \"Strange Days\", Bassett played Lornette \"Mace\" Mason, a chauffeur and bodyguard. In \"Vampire in Brooklyn\", she played Rita Veder, a tortured cop with a dark secret. She was excited to work with Eddie Murphy in \"Vampire in Brooklyn\", as well as director Wes Craven. Bassett had previously worked with Craven on television shows. Bassett's character in \"Waiting to Exhale\", Bernadine Harris, was betrayed by her husband and in revenge she set fire to his entire wardrobe and vehicle, then sold what was left for one dollar. Bassett described the then-recently filmed party scene and her character in \"Waiting to Exhale\" to the \"Orlando Sentinel\". Bassett said, \"The thing is that my character is thinking about how her husband has left her. I have a cigarette in one hand, and I'm drinking. Basically, the four of us are sitting there talking about men and having some fun.\"\n\nIn 1997, she starred as the President's advisor in \"Contact\". Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" opinioned that Bassett was \"largely wasted as a Presidential assistant.\"\n\nIn 1998, Fatboy Slim sampled Bassett's voice from 1995's \"Strange Days\", specifically the line \"this is your life, right here, right now!\", for his hit single \"Right Here, Right Now\". Also in 1998, Bassett starred in \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\", once again collaborating with McMillan. She played Stella, a 40-year-old American professional woman who falls in love with a 20-year-old Jamaican man. She received praise for the performance, Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" calling Bassett's character \"the best thing in the movie\" and writing that Bassett \"portrays this high-strung superwoman with such intensity that she makes her almost believable.\"\n\nIn 1999, Bassett starred in \"Music of the Heart\", once again collaborating with horror icon Wes Craven. Matthew Eng wrote of her \"terrifically specific chemistry\" with Meryl Streep.\n\nIn 2000, Bassett turned down the lead role in \"Monster's Ball\" because of the script's sexual content; the role earned Halle Berry the Academy Award for Best Actress. The first film Bassett appeared in that year was \"Supernova\", where she played a medical officer. Her other two films released in 2000 were \"\" and \"Boesman and Lena\". Todd McCarthy of \"Variety\" wrote that in \"Boesman and Lena\" Bassett \"abandons her recently cultivated glamorous image to dig to the core of Lena’s fierce, probing, contentious, compassionate character.\" Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote Bassett captured all of her character's \"mercurial mood swings\" and both Bassett and her costar Danny Glover \"rise to the challenge of these larger-than-life roles, just as you would expect.\"\n\nShe appeared in the 2001 film \"The Score\". Her character was in a relationship with Robert De Niro's. She read the film's script and became interested. She was then telephoned by director Frank Oz, who told her Robert De Niro would \"like to meet with you\". Bassett met with De Niro and later realized the conversation was meant to break the ice before they started filming. In addition to \"The Score\", that year she also had a role in the television film \"Ruby's Bucket of Blood\". The following year, in 2002, Bassett acted in \"Sunshine State\" and \"The Rosa Parks Story\". In \"The Rosa Parks Story\", Bassett was cast as Rosa Parks. Laura Fries of \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote that Bassett \"takes her physical strength and turns it inward to portray Parks\" and expressed her belief that \"lesser hands\" would allow for misinterpretation or gross underplay of Parks' personality. In addition to positive reception of her role, Bassett was seen as the \"star\" of the film due to playing the lead and earned a nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie for her performance.\n\nIn 2003, she read from the WPA slave narratives in \"Unchained Memories\". In the 1930s, about 100,000 former slaves were still living during the Great Depression, of which 2,300 were interviewed part of the Federal Writers' Project. The transcripts of the Slave Narratives collection of the Library of Congress is a record of slavery, bondage and misery. That year she also appeared in the film \"Masked and Anonymous\", playing a mistress. Ann Hornaday noted her as among the \"endless parade of actors who show up even for the briefest of appearances\".\n\nIn 2004, she had roles in the films \"The Lazarus Child\" and \"Mr. 3000\". \"Mr. 3000\" was a comedy in which Bassett costarred with Bernie Mac. When asked if the film was much easier to act in than the more intense roles she had in the past, Bassett responded, \"This was much easier. This was a walk in the park. It was pretty easy compared to some of the roles Ive done that call for so much emotion or physicality.\" At the time of the film's release, she called both Bernie Mac and Laurence Fishburne, who she had worked with in the past, her \"favorites\" and said the pair were both \"highly professional and extraordinarily talented.\" The only film she appeared in during the following year was \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\" in an uncredited voice role.\nIn the 2006 film \"Akeelah and the Bee\", Bassett portrayed Tanya Anderson, the mother of the film's lead, Akeelah, played by Keke Palmer. Bassett said she loved the story, viewing the lead character as someone that \"could be anyone because each of us have had dreams and aspirations and wanting to be and needing to be supported and directed\", and described working with Palmer as being \"really wonderful.\" According to Bassett, the two bonded and that Palmer was as good an actress as any adult she had worked with. Bassett appeared in the television film \"Time Bomb\" the same year. Her role was seen as just an \"extended cameo\" by Brian Lowry of \"Variety\".\n\nBassett provided her voice for the 2007 film \"Meet the Robinsons\". When asked about her motives in taking on the role, Bassett said, \"For one, it was a character I had never played before, which is always important to me, to keep me sharp. But it was also the desire to be part of a well-written movie that has something really positive to say about families and about all the different ways there can be to make a family.\"\n\nShe appeared in the 2008 film \"Gospel Hill\". Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" wrote Bassett's \"fiery self-possession brings a spark of passion to her stick-figure character\". She next appeared in \"Of Boys and Men\", portraying Rieta Cole, the matriarch of a Chicago family who is killed in an accident in the beginning of the film and is seen through flashbacks for the remainder of the film. She and her costars Robert Townsend and Victoria Rowell were seen by Robert Gillard of \"LA Sentinel\" as doing wonderful jobs of \"capturing the emotions of a family stricken by grief.\" Bassett also had a role in Nothing But the Truth in 2008. Bassett joined the regular cast of \"ER\" for the show's final season (2008–2009). She portrayed Dr. Catherine Banfield, an exacting Chief of the ER who was also working to recover from the death of a son and to bring another child into her family. Bassett's husband Courtney Vance played her television husband on \"ER\" as Russell Banfield.\n\nIn the 2009 film \"Notorious\", Bassett portrayed Voletta Wallace, the mother of The Notorious B.I.G. To portray Wallace's Jamaican accent, Bassett conversed with her on and off the film set, and she practiced her accent using tapes that Wallace made. Bassett said she jumped at the chance to be part of the film after reading the script. She felt it did a \"wonderful job of bringing\" The Notorious B.I.G.'s \"life to the page.\" Bassett earned positive reviews for her performance in the film, noted as being one of the more experienced actors involved.\n\nIn 2010, Bassett lent her voice to portray First Lady Michelle Obama on an episode of \"The Simpsons\" titled \"Stealing First Base\". Bassett was seen as a \"terrific\" fill in for Obama. Bassett was also cast in the superhero film \"Green Lantern\", released in 2011, as notable DC Comics character Amanda Waller. Bassett said working on the film was \"a lot of fun\" and that she enjoyed being a part of it. Despite this, Bassett was taken \"out of her element\" with the arrangements made that accommodated the computer-generated effects. She called it her first time doing \"this kind of movie\" but expressed interest in seeing what her scenes looked like.\nIn 2010, \"Deadline Hollywood\" reported that Bassett would have a role in \"One Police Plaza\". In 2011, Bassett co-starred with Samuel L. Jackson in the play \"The Mountaintop\" a fictionalized depiction of the night before the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King (Jackson portrays MLK) while at the Lorraine Motel. The critically acclaimed play by Katori Hall originally debuted in London's West End in 2009 and went on to win the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play. The production opened on Broadway on October 13, 2011. In March 2011, it was reported that Bassett had signed up for a lead role in the ABC pilot \"Identity\".\n\nShe also appeared in the 2011 film \"Jumping the Broom\", playing the matriarch of a wealthy family. Bassett had a good feeling about the film from \"the start\", and believed her character had a \"real presence\" in the film and felt she was active in the plot. Bassett's and Loretta Devine's performances in the film were called \"in some ways too fierce for the room, offering nuances of hostility and hurt that the movie cannot really handle\" and contributing to the \"unevenness of the performances\" in the film. Bassett and Devine were noted as \"superb, distinguished actresses\" by Kirk Honeycutt of \"The Hollywood Reporter\", but were seen as having been \"asked to overdo every moment with permanent scowls and body language more suitable to \"Mortal Kombat\".\"\nDespite this, her performance was given some positive attention, with Elizabeth Weitzman of \"New York Daily News\" saying Bassett \"makes the movie hers\". The film was Bassett's second time working with Devine, as the pair had worked together previously in \"Waiting to Exhale\". Director Salim Akil said Bassett's presence quietly makes a big difference.\n\nBassett was featured in the 2012 film \"This Means War\", having been known to be attached to the film since two years prior. Tambay A. Obenson of IndieWire attributed Bassett's lack of appearances in promotional material to her having a small role and her demographic not being targeted by the film. Bassett also appeared as herself in \"I Ain't Scared Of You\".\n\nBassett portrayed Coretta Scott King in the television film \"Betty and Coretta\", which aired on February 2, 2013, continuing her trend of portraying real women. Bassett had previously played Shabazz in both \"Malcolm X\" and \"Panther\", but instead played Coretta Scott King opposite to Mary J. Blige, who played Shabazz. Bassett was surprised to learn after researching that Coretta initially refused Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"advances\" and called Mrs. King a \"modern day iconic heroine.\" While being asked about what drew her to play real-life women, Bassett answered \"The respect that I have for their lives—their stories, vulnerabilities, strength, and resolve.\" Bassett began filming her scenes during the latter part of the previous year. Mary J. Blige, when asked about what kind of experience it was to work with Bassett, said that she was \"one of Angela's biggest fans\" while calling her an \"amazing woman.\" The film received mix reviews, including negative reactions from Ilyasah Shabazz and Bernice King, the daughters of Betty Shabazz and Coretta Scott King.\n\nBassett recently appeared as Secret Service director Lynne Jacobs in the action thriller \"Olympus Has Fallen\", released in March 22, 2013. Bassett was reported to have a role in the film in June 2012, the month before filming began. In an interview with \"The Huffington Post\", Bassett noted that there had \"never been a female head of the Secret Service, much less a woman of color\". She called the decision to have a female African-American Secret Service director \"a bold casting choice\". Overall, Bassett viewed the film as authentic. Bassett described working with Morgan Freeman as wonderful, but she admitted to being intimidated by him. She was impressed with the preparation of director Antoine Fuqua, who she said \"was just preparation to the hilt\" and expressed her interest in working with him again. She appeared in the 2013 film \"Black Nativity\". She sang and it was seen as contributing to the film's \"blissful unreality\". She was asked by the film's director, Kasi Lemmons, if she could sing and Bassett admitted to lying to get the role. She joked to reporter Jennifer H. Cunningham, \"Yes, I can sing — you didn’t ask how well!\" Singing in a film was a new experience for Bassett, who had never had to sing before and had always lip-synced.\nIn 2013, Bassett appeared on FX TV show \"\" as Marie Laveau, a voodoo witch. Bassett praised the writers, calling them \"amazing\". Her agent approached Ryan Murphy about her having a role in the series and he told the agent that she was the person he had in mind for Marie Laveau. Bassett watched the previous seasons of the series before meeting with Murphy and found the writing \"wonderful\" and the characters \"so realized\". Bassett's performance earned her a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie. She returned to the show for its fourth season \"\", playing Desiree Dupree, a three-breasted woman. She received another nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie.\n\nIt was announced in May 2014 that Bassett would make her directorial debut with \"Whitney\", a TV film based on the life of Whitney Houston, who Bassett had worked with previously. Bassett had previously expressed interest in directing the year before. It was announced in early June 2014 that Yaya DaCosta would play Houston in the film. Houston's daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, insulted Bassett on Twitter for not casting her as her mother in the film, to which Bassett admitted in an interview that she had never thought about casting Brown. On June 11, 2014, Ruby Dee died from natural causes. Bassett had previously worked with her on \"Betty and Coretta\" and was reported to attend the Riverside Church memorial for Dee on September 20, 2014.\n\nIn the 2015 film \"Survivor\", Bassett portrayed United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maureen Crane. In a negative review of the film, Mark Kermode lamented Bassett \"appears from behind closed doors like a celebrity guest on \"Stars in Their Eyes\".\"\n\nBasset also voiced the character Six in the first person shooter game, \"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege\".\n\nIn March 2016, Bassett appeared in \"London Has Fallen\", reprising her role as Lynne Jacobs. Bassett noted it was \"the very first sequel I've ever done\" and that she had been excited at the prospect of another film after the initial success of \"Olympus Has Fallen\".\nIn June 2016, the Human Rights Campaign released a video in tribute to the victims of the 2016 Orlando gay nightclub shooting; in the video, Bassett and others told the stories of the people killed there. Bassett appeared in \"\". She also directed its sixth episode, which aired October 19, 2016. The episode marks the third time a woman has directed the show. Co-creator Ryan Murphy praised Bassett in an interview with E! News, saying he told her she would \"'do this big, big episode and you're going to knock it out of the park,' and she did. And I've seen it time and time again with these women that we brought into this directing world that they're just killing it, and they're working twice as hard because they know they have a lot to prove.\"\n\nIn March 2017, Bassett appeared in \"Ache\", an episode of the television series \"Underground\". Executive producer and director Anthony Hemingway said her character \"was written with Angela in mind\" and that the entire cast came to see Bassett the day she filmed her performance.\nIn May 2017, Bassett appeared in an episode of \"Master of None\", portraying major character Denise's mother Catherine. Lena Waithe wanted Bassett after being impressed by her previous work though was convinced she would turn down the role and said Bassett's inclusion influenced the series drastically with \"another layer\" of tension. The writers of the series also favored Bassett for the role after seeing her performance in \"The Jacksons: An American Dream\" and related her character's evolution in that feature to Catherine.\n\nIn January 2018, Bassett starred in the Fox first responder procedural drama \"9-1-1\", of which she is also a producer. In February 2018, Bassett starred in the acclaimed Marvel superhero film \"Black Panther\", as Dowager Queen Ramonda, mother of the titular character.\n\nBassett has been noted for portraying real life African-American women, as well as strong women. Bassett said in 2001 that she liked those roles and added: \"That's the image that I like to put out there, and those are the parts I'm attracted to. But not iron-fist kind of strong, just self-assured. I'm nice too.\" She has turned down roles which she viewed as demeaning to her image. \"This is a career about images. It's celluloid; they last for ever. I'm a black woman from America. My people were slaves in America, and even though we're free on paper and in law, I'm not going to allow you to enslave me on film, in celluloid, for all to see. And to cross the water, to countries where people will never meet people who look like me. So it becomes a bigger thing than me just becoming a movie star, and me just being on TV. So if you're going to show every black woman as 400lb or every black woman as the prostitute on the street ... But I have always maintained that [the roles] I cannot do because of the way I'm made up, or because of the way I think, I don't begrudge that there is someone else who has no issues with that.\"\n\nBassett married actor Courtney B. Vance in 1997. In the summer of 2005, they starred together in a production of \"His Girl Friday\" at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The couple's twins – son Slater Josiah Vance and daughter Bronwyn Golden Vance – carried by a surrogate, were born on January 27, 2006.\n\nBassett is a supporter of programs for the arts, especially for youth. She annually attends events for children with diabetes and those in foster homes. She is an active Ambassador of UNICEF for the United States. Bassett is a supporter of the Royal Theater Boys & Girls Club in her hometown of St. Petersburg, Florida.\n\nShe is represented by the Executive Speakers Bureau of Memphis.\n\nIn early 2007, Bassett donated $2,300 to the presidential campaign of Barack Obama. Bassett supported Obama in his reelection campaign. In June 2012, she made an appearance at the St. Petersburg office of his campaign and said the election was not one \"where we can sit on the sidelines\".\nBassett attended the second inauguration of Barack Obama on January 20, 2013. She endorsed Hillary Clinton for president during the United States presidential election, 2016, saying \"Bar none, Clinton would make a great president.\" Bassett also spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, introducing survivors of the previous year's Charleston church shooting, an incident about which she spoke during her remarks. After Clinton was defeated in the general election, Bassett tweeted, \"Only 1455 days until November 3, 2020. Rest up my country. #ProudOfHer\".\n\nBassett was initiated as an honorary member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority on July 13, 2013.\n\n"}

It is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London (Cat. 7943-1862, usually on display in room 8, case 16, in the \"Medieval and Renaissance\" gallery). \n\nThe cross is made of cedar wood and covered with plates of gold filigree work. The \"corpus\" or figure of Christ, was probably made in Winchester, and is in walrus ivory; the titulus and medallions are in cloisonné enamel, and apparently also English. The body of the reliquary, because of a technical \"trick\" in the gold filigree, is thought to be German, around the same date, probably from the area of Aachen and Essen. \n\nThe V&A says \"the cross is one of the rare surviving pieces which give substance to descriptions in contemporary documentary sources of the sumptuous church furnishings of pre-Conquest England. The enamels are unique in Anglo-Saxon art and may have been made by an English goldsmith familiar with German work. The wood core of the cross was perhaps regarded as a relic of the True Cross. It is most unlikely because of its size and weight, that it was made to be worn as a pectoral cross and more probable that the suspension loop allowed it to hang above an altar or shrine.\"\n\nThe body of the cross is of cedar wood, covered with sheets of gold, the back with repousse decoration now badly crumpled and flattened, the front decorated with filigree work, enamels and an ivory corpus of the figure of Christ. This is carved in walrus ivory. Haloed and crowned, the bearded Christ wears an elaborately pleated loin-cloth, knotted through the folded girdle. The head leans towards the right shoulder and the long hair falls in several plaits onto the shoulders. The figure is held in place by golden nails through the palms. The titulus above Christ and four medallions with emblems of the Evangelists are of cloisonné enamel. The back of the cross shows the Holy Lamb and the emblems of the Evangelists in repoussé or beaten work.\n\nThe height of the cross is 18.5 cm, the width 13.7 cm, the depth 2.6 cm, the weight 0.22 kg. The height of the figure is 12.2 cm, the width 10.9 cm.\n\nIn 1926, during cleaning work, a human finger, perhaps female, was found in a cavity underneath the corpus. A fragmentary and not totally legible inscription around the edge of the cross seems to list the relics of saints once contained in the cavity beneath the ivory figure of Christ.\n\nDespite Papal disapproval of the dismemberment of saints, a finger relic was by no means unusual in Anglo-Saxon England: King Athelstan bestowed one third of his extensive collection of relics to the monastery of St. Mary and St. Peter at Exeter in AD 932. The gift included a finger, purportedly that of Mary Magdalene.\n\nDavid Wilson points to the close similarity between the figure on the cross and that in a tinted drawing in the Ramsey Psalter, dated 980-1000.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15449517", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15449517", "title": "Asian-American theatre", "text": "Asian-American theatre\n\nAsian-American theatre is theatre written, directed or acted by Asian Americans. From initial efforts by four theatre companies in the 1960s, Asian-American theatre has grown to around forty groups today. Early productions often had Asian themes or settings, but today it is becoming more common to see Asian-Americans in roles that defy the stereotypes.\n\nAsian-American theatre emerged in the 1960s and the 1970s with the foundation of four theatre companies: East West Players in Los Angeles, Asian American Theatre Workshop (later renamed Asian American Theater Company) in San Francisco, Theatrical Ensemble of Asians (later renamed Northwest Asian American Theatre) in Seattle, and Pan Asian Repertory Theatre in New York City. The Northwest Asian American Theatre was one of the first in the Pacific Northwest. The four companies have provided the resources and opportunities to actors, writers, directors, designers, and producers to pursue and define \"Asian-American theatre\" for over five decades. By the end of the 1990s, the number of Asian-American theatre companies and performance groups grew to about forty. In addition, such companies helped integrate Asian-Americans into many popular theatre companies by normalizing Asian actors. Asian-American plays have appeared on Broadway and regional theatres and have received major awards both nationally and internationally. Asian-American actors have used Asian-American theatre companies as their artistic bases while pursuing careers in the mainstream theatre, film and television. Alternative forms of theatre and performance such as multimedia performance, solo performance and spoken word have also shaped Asian-American theatre. In the beginning, participants of Asian-American theatre were mostly of East Asian descent, but in the 1990s and the 21st century, more artists of South Asian and Southeast Asian and backgrounds have joined the community and have made Asian-American theatre one of the fastest growing and changing sectors in American theatre.\n\nEast West Players (EWP) was founded in 1965 by a group of actors who wanted to fight racism in the entertainment industry by creating non-stereotypical roles for Asian Americans. Led by the Japanese-American actor Mako, the actors at EWP first saw theatre as a venue to showcase their talent for television and film producers and directors, but by the early 1970s, the EWP began to actively sponsor original plays by Asian Americans. Frank Chin, who founded the Asian American Theatre Workshop, argued that Asian-American actors needed Asian-American playwrights to create believable roles and to end dependence on the mainstream acting industry. Theatrical Ensemble of Asians (TEA) began in 1974 on the campus of the University of Washington, and after the founding students graduated, moved into a theatre in the International District, renaming them selves the Asian Exclusion Act. The theatre group moved around several locations before finding a home at the Theatre Off Jackson. It was late renamed again as the Northwest Asian American Theatre (NWAAT). In addition to acting and playwriting, NWAAT emphasized community activism and became a cultural center for Asian Americans in Seattle; many of the plays they performed were directly targeted at expressing the painful history of discrimination Asian-Americans in America suffered after the Chinese Exclusion Act. Pan Asian Repertory Theatre (Pan Asian Rep), on the other hand, emerged as part of Off-Off-Broadway theatre in 1978. Founded by Tisa Chang, Pan Asian Rep became the representative Asian-American theatre company in New York City and introduced Asian-American plays to the East Coast audiences. In the 1980s and 1990s, Asian-American theatre companies were founded with more diverse purposes and styles. Companies such as Ma-Yi Theater Company (New York City) focus on producing new, original plays, as did the now-defunct Lodestone Theatre Ensemble (Los Angeles, 1999-2009). Others companies' agendas departed greatly from the original four: National Asian American Theatre Company (NAATCO) in New York City, for instance, stages canonized Western plays with all Asian cast and Mu Performing Arts in Minneapolis incorporates Asian theatrical styles to specifically cater to local audiences.\n\nAmerican theatre in the 1950s was dominated by popular Broadway shows that featured Asian characters and settings, and shows such as \"The King and I\" and \"Flower Drum Song\" provided employment to a number of \"Oriental\" actors. However, many roles were blatantly stereotypical and racist and many major roles were cast with white actors with facial makeup resembling an \"Oriental\". The popularity of Asian themes in Broadway shows did not continue through the 1960s, and \"Oriental\" actors found themselves unemployed in large numbers. While they were out of work, they observed white actors getting cast in Asian roles. \"Oriental\" actors began to protest this practice by creating activist organizations and creating work for themselves. The term \"Asian-American actor\" emerged in the late 1960s when the Asian American movement challenged the racist history of the label \"Oriental.\" By the 1970s, Asian-American actors were well organized in their fight for jobs and positive images for Asians. In New York, an activist group called Oriental Actors of America regularly protested openings of shows with white actors playing Asians. In Los Angeles, East West Players became the most visible venue for Asian-American actors to find acting employment and to participate in activism. The company's proximity to Hollywood attracted many ambitious and talented Asian-American actors to Los Angeles. By the mid-1990s, over 75% of all Asian-American actors had acted on the stage of EWP.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the controversy over the musical \"Miss Saigon\" surfaced when Asian-American actors protested the casting of the British actor Jonathan Pryce for the role of the half-Vietnamese Engineer in the Broadway production of the musical. The protest was led by many prominent Asian-American theatre artists, including actor BD Wong, the artistic director of Pan Asian Rep, Tisa Chang, and the playwright David Henry Hwang. Asian-American actors initially lost their fight when the musical opened on Broadway with Pryce, but in the long run, the controversy generated many positive aftereffects for Asian-American actors. The musical's ten-year run on Broadway employed an unprecedented number of Asian-American actors, and the role of the Engineer was subsequently cast with Asian-American actors.\n\nAsian Americans have won the fight for employment, and while some roles for them stereotype those of Asian descent, Asian Americans are increasingly winning roles that respect and tolerate Asian Americans from the majority of producers who are realizing the reality of racial bigotry and ignorance that brings hostility and degradation to those oppressed.\n\nBefore the 1960s, Asian-American plays were virtually non-existent, but various initiatives, including East West Players' playwriting contest, encouraged Asian-American writers to adapt their short stories and novels into plays and to write original plays. The first wave of Asian-American playwrights included Wakako Yamauchi, Momoko Iko, Edward Sakamoto, Hiroshi Kashiwagi, and Frank Chin. Common themes in plays by first wave writers were Asian-American history, generational conflict, cultural identity, cultural nationalism, and family history. In 1972, Frank Chin's \"The Chickencoop Chinaman\" became the first Asian-American play to be produced in New York City, and since then, Chin has become a major spokesperson for Asian-American playwriting. He founded the Asian American Theatre Workshop in San Francisco to promote original playwriting by Asian Americans. The most commercially successful Asian-American play was David Henry Hwang's play \"M. Butterfly\", which became the first Asian-American play to be produced on Broadway and won the Tony Award for Best Play in 1988. The success of \"M. Butterfly\" created a national interest in Asian-American plays, and regional theatre companies around the country began to produce plays by Hwang and other second wave Asian-American writers such as Philip Kan Gotanda and Velina Hasu Houston. Such interest also promoted the publication of first anthologies of Asian-American plays in the early 1990s. The mainstreaming of Asian-American plays increased with works by third wave writers such as Diana Son, Sung Rno, Han Ong, Chay Yew, Rick Shiomi, and Ralph Peña. These third wave writers felt that race and ethnicity were mere jumping off point in addressing multifaceted experiences of being an Asian American and wrote about any topic that interested them. All three waves of Asian American playwrights continue to produce works that define not only Asian-American theatre, but also American theatre and global theatre.\n\nOne of the pioneers of Asian-American alternative theatre is Ping Chong, a Chinese American multimedia artist who has created avant-garde theatre since the early 1970s. He has used visual effects, sound control, dance, mime, spectacle, and other methods based on the sensibilities of Cantonese opera. Another form of alternative theatre is solo performance. Often written, directed, and acted by one performer, solo performance has provided many Asian-American artists with the opportunity to voice their experiences. Solo performers, such as Dan Kwong, Denise Uyehara, Jude Narita, and Lane Nishikawa, have toured with their shows and have introduced Asian-American theatre to audiences in all parts of the country. Group performances have also toured, especially to colleges and universities. Often comedic, group performances, such as Slant Performance Group and the 18 Mighty Mountain Warriors, have been popular amongst college students, many of whom saw Asian-American performers onstage for the first time. Recently, spoken word groups have become the newest form of Asian-American theatre and performance.\n\nIn June 2006, \"Next Big Bang:\" The First Asian-American Theatre Conference was held in Los Angeles, spearheaded by East West Players. It was followed in June 2007 with the first ever National Asian American Theatre Festival, held in New York City. The two-week festival was co-organized by Pan Asian Rep, Ma-Yi Theater and NAATCO. From June 11 – June 24, work from more than 35 emerging and established artists and groups from across the nation was presented in over 13 venues around New York City's boroughs.\n\"Shaping Our Voice & Vision\": the 2nd National Asian American Theater Conference took place June 5–7, 2008, in Minneapolis, co-hosted by Mu Performing Arts and Pangea World Theater.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was originally two houses, which were joined in the 18th century. It formed part of Lorimer's Row, a group of buildings with an arcade at ground level, as distinct from the Rows in the centre of the city whose walkways are at the first floor level. From an early date, the south part of the building has been an inn, its first licence possibly dating from 1494. The separate cabin or chamber has been used for a number of functions; these include being a ticket office for stage coach operators in the 18th century and in the 20th century a soda fountain bar and a barber's shop. In the 19th century the southern part of the building was an inn while the northern part housed a shop. The inn closed in the 1930s. In 1948 the building was used as an antique shop but its condition deteriorated so much that it was threatened with demolition. In the 1950s the Chester Civic Trust campaigned for its survival, it was restored, and has since been used as a clothes shop and, more recently, as a restaurant.\n\nThe building is timber-framed on a sandstone plinth with brickwork added later which has subsequently been rendered and painted. The roofs are of grey slates. The two buildings comprising the whole have separate frames each with roofs leading to gables over the street. At ground level the southern part of the building has an arcade open to the street with a pier to the south and an octagonal column south of the centre.

Some shows had a peep show element to them, where a viewer could pay extra to peer through a hole and see a supposed artifact from the story.\n\nIn 16th-century Italy, prayers would often be sung in the presence of illuminated scrolls while secular society produced the \"\" or \"singing bench\" where a person would stand on a bench point to pictures with a stick.\n\nIn Spain up to the 19th century there were blind men with a young \"helper\" who would make a living by going from town to town where they would display illustrations and the blind man would recite/sing the story, often about truculent crimes, while his helper pointed at the illustration relevant at that point. These were called \"\" (blind man stories).\n\nThe singing bench migrated northward to Central and Northern Europe where it served as sensationalist quasi-news about murder, fires, death, affairs, sex scandals and the like. Performers of such controversial bench songs were seen as vagrants and troublemakers and were often arrested, exiled, or ostracised for their activities.\n\nIn Persia, (compare India's ) banner artists had the foresight to paint a handsome police officer in the corner as a fail-safe against the wrath of police harassment—the narrator would be relating the tale of a hero's exploits and when a cop would appear in the crowd the narrator would point to the cop on the banner and shower the character with flattery in the context of the story.\n\nIn Czechoslovakia banner shows were called \"\".

This is evident, for example, in awarded to some games in certain tournaments and also in the world of chess composition. There are many books published featuring chess problems or puzzles that emphasize its aesthetic aspect. One of the earliest is from the 9th century AD. Aesthetics in chess can be both a source of pleasure for humans and also instruction, as compositions or games featuring it typically illustrate original ideas or new instantiations of old ones. A good chess problem composer, however, is not necessarily a good player.\n\nFactors about a game or move sequence (also referred to as a \"combination\") that might cause it to be regarded as 'brilliant' by most players include, among other things: expediency, disguise, sacrifice, correctness, preparation, paradox, unity and originality.\n\n\nComposition conventions such as not having any checks or in the first (i.e. key) move, and the use of variations to illustrate a particular theme (e.g. zugzwang, pin), also play a role in the aesthetics of the game.\n\nConceptually, a 'common ground' of aesthetics between the domains of real (e.g. tournament) games and compositions can be established. These are beauty characteristics that apply approximately equally to both domains; examples include heuristic violations, economy and material sacrifice. This common ground is useful in computational models of aesthetics in the game because it helps in experiments comparing the beauty of compositions (on average, considered more beautiful) against the beauty of real games (on average, considered less beautiful). Some factors that pertain solely to real games (e.g. pressure under time control) or compositions (e.g. avoidance of castling moves) may be conflated with \"aesthetics\" in the game—and perhaps to some degree this is justifiable; however, they would lie outside the common ground described above.\n\n"}
{"id": "13022087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13022087", "title": "Coptic architecture", "text": "Coptic architecture\n\nCoptic architecture is the architecture of the Copts, who form the majority of Christians in Egypt.\n\nCoptic churches range from great cathedrals such as Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral to the smallest churches in rural villages. Many ancient monasteries like Monastery of Saint Anthony also exist. Ancient churches like the Hanging Church in Coptic Cairo carry important historical value to the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Copts in general.\n\nSome authorities trace the origins of Coptic architecture to Ancient Egyptian architecture, seeing a similarity between the plan of ancient Egyptian temples, progressing from an outer courtyard to a hidden inner sanctuary to that of Coptic churches, with an outer narthex or porch, and (in later buildings) a sanctuary hidden behind an iconostasis. Others see the earliest Coptic churches as progressing, like those of the Byzantine and Roman churches, from the Graeco-Roman basilica. The ruins of the cathedral at Hermopolis Magna (c.430–40) are the major survival of the single brief period when the Coptic Orthodox Church represented the official religion of the state in Egypt.\n\nThus, from its early beginnings Coptic architecture fused indigenous Egyptian building traditions and materials with Graeco-Roman and Christian Byzantine styles. The fertile styles of neighbouring Christian Syria had a greatly increased influence after the 6th century, including the use of stone tympani.\n\nOver a period of two thousand years, Coptic architecture incorporated native Egyptian, Graeco-Roman, Byzantine and Western European styles.\n\nAfter the Muslim conquest of Egypt, the influence of Coptic art and architecture on Egyptian Islamic architecture and the incorporation of some Coptic features in Islamic building in Egypt can be seen. This can be explained by the fact that the early Muslim rulers of Egypt, much like the Ptolemaic and Byzantine rulers before them, recruited native Egyptians to undertake the building labor. In later centuries, Coptic art and architecture also incorporated motifs inspired by Islamic styles. In particular, very early examples of the pointed arch appear in Coptic churches from the 4th century onwards, and this became a notable feature of Islamic architecture, and may have spread from there to European Gothic architecture, though this whole area remains controversial among architectural historians, with many now seeing the origins among the Assyrians, from whom it spread to Persia, where it joined the Islamic style.\n\nThe Coptic Church broke from the other Eastern Orthodox Churches in 451 AD. After that date, the Copts, then a great majority of the Egyptian population, were shunned and often persecuted by their Byzantine rulers until the conquest of Egypt by Islam, after which the slowly declining Coptic population was in a rather precarious position. Coptic architecture therefore lacked the lavish patronage of rulers and the Court, which was directly responsible for most of the important buildings of Byzantine and medieval Catholic architecture. Most buildings are small, conservative in design, and remain closer to vernacular styles. They also have a tendency to massive construction, which is partly a surviving Egyptian taste from the Pharaonic period, partly reflects the need to semi-fortify buildings, partly is an inevitable result of mudbrick construction of large structures, and is also partly to keep them cool in the Egyptian climate.\n\nWell before the break of 451, Egyptian Christianity had pioneered monasticism, with many communities being established in deliberately remote positions, especially in Southern Egypt. The relatively large number of buildings surviving from the early periods of monasticism, from about the 5th century onwards, are one of the most important groups of early Christian buildings to remain, and offer a useful corrective to the Court art of Ravenna or Constantinople. Many very early wall-paintings also survive. Even the ruins of monasteries in many places have survived in a good enough condition to impress the visitor and inform the art historian. Early Coptic architecture is therefore of great importance in the study of Early Christian architecture in general.\nDespite the break with the other churches, aspects of the development of the arrangement of Coptic churches have paralleled those in Orthodoxy, such as the emergence of a solid iconostasis to separate the sanctuary, and the West, such as the movement over the centuries of the place of baptism from the narthex or outer porch into the rear of the nave. However the existence of three altars in the sanctuary, sometimes in separate apses, is typically and distinctively Coptic. The altars themselves are always free-standing.\n\nEspecially between the Muslim conquest and the 19th century, the external facade of Coptic urban churches is usually plain and discreet, as is the roof-line. Equally the monasteries were often enclosed with high blank walls to defend them from desert raiders during the Middle Ages. However, internally the churches can be ornately decorated, although monumental sculpture of holy figures is avoided as in Orthodoxy.\nMany Coptic monasteries and churches scattered throughout Egypt are built of mudbrick on the basilica plan inherited from Graeco-Roman architectural styles. They usually have heavy walls and columns, architraves and barrel-vaulted roofs, and end in a tripartite apse, but many variant plans exist. Domes are small compared to Byzantine churches, and from the 10th-century naves are often roofed with domed cupolas. The dome raised on a circular supporting wall, which is so characteristic of later Byzantine architecture, is rarely used. Massive timber is often used across the nave, sometimes to support a flat roof, and sometimes to give structural strength to the walls. Inside the churches are richly decorated with frescoed murals and reliefs.\n\nThe screen known as the iconostasis separating the sanctuary from the main body of the church is one of the main features of any Coptic church. The Coptic iconostasis is usually less completely composed of icons than the Eastern Orthodox one, although there will always be several. It is very often an open-work screen, usually made of ebony and sometimes inlaid with ivory like that in Saint Mary Church (Harat Zewila). These may be in geometrical patterns comparable to the secular screens which are a feature of traditional Egyptian houses.\n\nThe iconostasis of Saint Mary Church in Harat Zewila in Old Cairo, rebuilt after 1321, shows the mixture of stylistic elements in Coptic architecture. The basic plan is that of the basilica, and recycled ancient columns are used. The older woodwork is Islamic in style, as are the Muqarnas in the pendentives, and a Gothic revival rood cross surmounts the iconostasis. This uses Islamic abstract motifs, which is also common. Some screens are pierced rather than solid.\n\nThere are many examples of Coptic iconostasis that predate the earliest surviving Eastern and Western counterparts.\n\nBetween the 7th and 12th centuries, many churches were built or modified with a distinctive Coptic feature, the \"khurus\", a space running across the whole width of the church separating the \"naos\" or nave from the sanctuary, rather as the choir does in Gothic architecture.\nEarly Coptic buildings contain elaborate and vigorous decorative carving on the capitals of columns, or friezes, some of which include interlace, confronted animals, and other motifs. These are also related to Coptic illuminated manuscripts and fabrics, and are often regarded as significant influences both on early Islamic art, like the Mshatta facade and on the Insular art of the British Isles (which appears to have been in contact with Coptic monasteries). From Insular art these motifs developed into European Romanesque art.\n\nThe architecture of many Coptic buildings remains poorly documented, as they become more at risk for abandonment, vandalism, and destruction. Time sensitive architectural and cultural research projects are awaiting initiation.\n\nExamples of significant Coptic architecture include:\n\nEuropean architectural styles began to influence Coptic churches in the eighteenth century. Examples of modern Coptic churches that have features of European churches are St. Mary (El Marashly) Church in Zamalek, Cairo designed by famous Coptic architect Ramses Wissa Wassef, other examples of modern Coptic architecture are the Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral, Cairo consecrated in 1968 and Archangel Michael's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral Aswan consecrated in 2006.\n\nThe coptic churches maintained the tradition of being built in the same shapes as older churches yet it is noticeable that modern Coptic churches are in general bigger than older ones.\n\nThe mark for the beginning of the revival of Coptic architecture was in the late eighteenth century by the building of the Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Azbakeya, Cairo, that became the seat of the Coptic Pope in 1800 A D.\n\nRegulations preventing building new churches, which were put by the Ottomans, were eased in the following years by the rulers of Egypt; allowing many churches to be rebuilt and new churches were also permitted after more than three hundred years of prevention.\n\nMany of the rebuilt churches carried the old features of the Coptic architecture with the addition of modern features.\n\n\n"}

Completed c 1472–80, it shows the Virgin Mary on her deathbed surrounded by the Twelve Apostles. The scene is borrowed from Jacobus de Voragine's thirteenth-century \"Legenda aurea\" which relates how the apostles were brought, at Mary's request, on clouds by angels to a house near Mount Zion to be with her in her final three days. On the third day Jesus appeared above her bed in a halo of light surrounded by angels to accept her soul at the point when his name was finally mentioned. Three days later he reappeared to accept her body.\n\n\"Death of the Virgin\" was almost certainly painted on commission and along with his \"\" and \"Portinari\" altarpieces is one of van der Goes most important works. It is likely one of his last paintings finished before he died. According to art historian Till-Holger Borchert, the panel \"belongs to the most impressive and artistically mature achievements of Early Netherlandish painting\". According to Lorne Campbell, the painting is van der Goes' \"most idiosyncratic masterpiece\".\n\nMary is shown lying in a blue robe with a white headdress on a timber bed with her head resting on a white pillow against a headboard. Her skin is thin and pallid, her hands clasped in prayer. She is surrounded by the twelve apostles who crowd around her bed. Peter is dressed in the white robes of a priest and holds a candle which in the then contemporary ritual will be handed to the dying woman. Above her Christ appears in a halo of light, holding his arms open to receive Mary's soul, while his palms are open to display the wounds sustained at Calvary. With this gesture, Christ identifies himself as both redeemer and conqueror of death.\n\n\"The Death\" marks a break in van der Goes style; line has become more important, setting is eliminated and the image lacks depth and is tightly contracted with only the bed, door and the body of the Virgin giving spatial indicators. It is renowned for not showing the apostles either in the traditional idealised manner nor as conventional figure types, but instead representing each as a unique individual, displaying their grief through a range of expressions and gestures, from sorrow and despair, to empathy and compassion. Because the artist has not used traditional representation it is difficult to identify each apostle.\nThe work is the best known and famous of one of a number of paintings after the death of Mary attributed to van der Goes or followers. Some art historians, including Friedrich Winkler (1964), believe he painted at least three versions, although it is generally accepted that preparatory sketches made for the Bruges work were later copied reproduced as paintings by late 15th century followers. Two similar paintings in the Berlin State Museums, the National Gallery, London, are attributed as \"after van der Goes\". They are usually thought to be later versions of a pen on paper drawing in the Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum, Brunswick, probably a copy of an original preparatory sketch by van der Goes. These works are similar to the Bruges paintings, but show the image in reverse. Infra-red photography shows that the composition was planned a highly detailed manner before the underdrawing was applied. Art historian Lorne Campbell writes, \"it is possible that the Brunswick drawing reflects one of his earliest ideas for the Bruges painting and that the Berlin, Prague and London pictures echo, however distantly, a later stage in his development of the Bruges composition.\nThe painting has been the subject of intense debate as to its date and meaning. Van der Goes spent the final years of his life submerged in depression. A number of art historians, including Max Friedländer, view the work as painted c. 1480 when the artist first began to display signs of mental suffering and thus view it as an expression of his illness. The artist's late life—he died in either 1482 or 1483—susceptibility to depression and insanity was discovered in 1863 in a chronicle by his contemporary Gaspar Ofhuys, who recorded a night in 1480 when van der Goes began to excitedly talk about how he was a doomed, lost soul and attempted to commit suicide and had to be forcibly held down.\n\nThis account greatly added to the painting's value in the eyes of late-19th-century painters. Vincent van Gogh mentions van der Goes three times in his letters, first in 1873 to his brother Theo, and on two more occasions when he wrote that he identified with the portrait of van der Goes in Emile Wauters's emotionally rendered 1872 painting \"Hugo van der Goes Undergoing Treatment at the Red Cloister\". Art historian Erwin Panofsky described van der Goes as \"the first artist to live up to a concept unknown to the Middle Ages but cherished by the European mind ever after, the concept of a genius both blessed and cursed with his diversity from ordinary human beings.\" Panofsky goes on to describe how the work's flatness represents an \"irrationality of space, light, colour, [the] expression of the artist's mental illness\".\n\nOther art historians, including Dirk de Vos and Susan Koslow, reject this thesis and argue that a wholly individualised conception of the scene would not have been acceptable to the painting's commissioners. In their view the pared down and contracted manner of the work is due to a desire to \"stress the solemnity of the event and its miraculous nature, van der Goes may have decided that material richness would be distracting and indecorous.\"\n\nVan der Goes was a highly progressive and original artist, but at the same time heavily influenced by both contemporary and predecessor artists. Inspiration for this work can be detected in Petrus Christus' c 1457–67 \"Death of the Virgin\" and by works attributed to the workshop of Rogier van der Weyden. The painting bears striking similarity to Martin Schongauer's c 1470–75 engraving of the same name, especially in its overall tone and mood, the depiction of Mary and the representation of the apostles seated to Mary's left. Yet there are significant differences; the bed in Schongauer's engraving is canopied and the distribution of the apostles is very different in the two works. The Schongauer is dated to at latest 1475, and it is a matter of significant and at times harsh and divisive critical debate as to which work came first (see above).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22022549", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22022549", "title": "Desilo", "text": "Desilo\n\nDesilo is a small valley in southern Bosnia and Herzegovina, located near the Neretva river and the Croatian border. Archaeological investigations in a small lake there in 2007 led to interesting finds of Illyrian boats. Desilo was in antiquity probably connected with the Neretva via Lake Hutovo Blato. References to the Neretva can be traced as far back as ancient times. In the era of ancient Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Neretva was known as \"Narenta\", \"Narona\" and \"Naro(n)\", and was home to the ancient Illyrian tribes of the Ardiaei and the Daorsi. The river Neretva provided them life, turning them into town builders, ship makers, seafarers and fishermen that were renowned in ancient times.\nIn the spring of 2007, \"Professor\" Snjezana Vasilj \"PhD\" of the University of Mostar excavated 2 Illyrian boats in Desilo, covered with stone-blocks and fragments of Roman wine amphorae. After intense excavations in the area of Hutovo Blato in the autumn of 2008, archaeologists from University of Oslo, Norway together with Dr. Vasilj found the very first traces of an Illyrian trading post from at least the 2nd-1st centuries BC.\nThe find is unique in a European perspective and the archaeologists have concluded that Desilo was an important trading post of great significance for contact between the Illyrians and the Romans.\nSurprisingly large finds have been made in a short period of time. The archaeologists have discovered the ruins of a settlement, the remains of a harbour that probably functioned as a trading post, as well as many sunken boats, covered with fragments of wine pitchers – so-called amphorae – from the 1st century B.C.\nThe archaeologist Adam Lindhagen, who has a PhD from the University of Lund and has specialised in Roman wine \"amphorae\", says that this is the most important find of all time from the Illyrian areas.\nThe boat finds had been speedily interpreted as proof that the Illyrians were pirates and that the ships had been sunk by the Romans. Although the pirate theory received considerable attention from the press in many parts of Europe, archaeologists Marina Prusac and Adam Lindhagen did not completely agree with this interpretation.\nAlthough there certainly were pirate activities along the Adriatic coast, they thought it rather odd that the pirates were so far inland and so near the important Roman colony of Narona. In their opinion Desilo might have been a trading centre.\nDesilo is located 32 kilometres from the coast on an alluvial plain by the Neretva river. The river is the only traffic artery along the entire Croatian coast that runs into the Bosnia and Herzegovina mountains. It is broad and free-flowing for the first 30 kilometres or so, after which its course becomes narrow.\nNear Desilo there are also ancient traffic arteries on land in the direction of both Narona, which was first a Greek trading post and then a Roman colony, and the Illyrian settlement of “Daorson” – the present-day Ošanići.\nDesilo is situated at the innermost point of a quiet bay where it was natural to transfer goods to smaller boats, so the place is perfect for an inner trading harbour. The presumed harbour represents a rare example of a meeting point in this impenetrable landscape.\n\nOver the past two thousand years the river has repeatedly changed its bed in the delta. The archaeologists found the remains of the Illyrian trading post under several metres of mud and ooze. It appears that parts of the wall that stuck up from the mud by the water’s edge may have functioned as one of the many quays at the trading post. The wall is 20 metres long and 60 centimetres wide, and is built as a polygonal structure.\nThe wall was solid and stable. The other side was not so well constructed and most likely functioned as a dam. There were a number of mooring holes placed at the same height on the wall, almost like a horizontal band.\nAnd as if this was not enough, the archaeologists from the University of Oslo also discovered that there were at least twice as many boats as those that had already been registered. The boats, which the Romans called Lembi, were well known for their fast manoeuvrability.\nThe many pieces of pottery found indicate that this was a major trading post. And last but not least: about a hundred metres from the harbour site they found an Illyrian settlement. Moreover, in collaboration with the land-owner and along with master's degree student Jo-Simon Frøshaug Stokke, the recently graduated archaeologists Lene Os Johannessen and Ole Christian Aslaksen discovered terrace formations in the mountainside.\nThis find can only be interpreted as indicating the presence of a settlement that presumably existed for several hundred years or even longer before the trade between the Illyrians and the Romans started.\nSome graves – older than the other finds – were previously discovered close to the settlement. A number of individual finds have also been made in the area: anchor parts, lance tips and fibula, and metal buckles for fastening clothes.\nThanks to the clay and the fresh water the objects are surprisingly well preserved. Salt water would have destroyed the wood.\n\nOn the lake bed, together with the boats, archaeologists from University of Mostar found hundreds of pieces of wine amphorae of type Lamboglia 2 and as many as 700 lids from these vessels.\nAs archaeologist Adam Lindhagen, who has a PhD from the University of Lund and has specialised in Roman wine amphorae points out, imports from the Roman colony Narona must therefore have been far more extensive than we previously thought.\nHe has analyzed the pottery to find out where the amphorae came from. He can now say that they were exclusively produced along the Dalmatian coast – from where wine was exported to the entire Roman Empire.\nIn exchange for wine the Romans may have bought salt, metal, leather and slaves. The price could have been similar to that in Gaul. According to Diodorus Siculus (100-44 B.C.), the Gauls were happy to swap a slave for a 25-litre amphora of wine.\nWhile Professor Vasilj was of the view that all the boats were sunk at the same time in a Roman campaign against Illyrian pirates, amphorae which are later in date than those from the boatwrecks have also been found in the lake, something which might contradict such an assumption.\n\nOne big question remains unsolved, and that is why none of the amphorae are whole. They are all in fragments.\nThe Norwegian archaeologists claim that it’s possible Illyrians made ritual offerings to the sea – a well-known phenomenon in Scandinavia during the Iron Age, but this is really a loose theory because it would be the first example ever heard of from the Illyrian area or whole region of eastern Adriatic. Indeed, archaeologists still don't know why the boats were sunk and the pitchers destroyed, but doctor Lindhagen from the University of Lund assume that it's absurd to think that the Romans sank almost a one thousand amphorae containing their own wine. Their explanations is that the amphorae may have been dumped when they’d been emptied. \nHowever, piles of horse teeth and bones, Illyrian weaponry like axes and spear tips and pottery have also been found in the water along the boats and amphorae, what gives \"Professor\" Snjezana Vasilj \"PhD\" and her colleagues from University of Mostar a strong arguments to stick to their \"Pirate theory\" and a Roman war campaign against Illyrian pirates, after all, in the Illyrian wars of 229 BC and 219 BC, Rome overran the Illyrian settlements in the Neretva river valley and suppressed the piracy that had made the Adriatic unsafe for commerce.\n\nThe original homeland of the Ardiaei is said to have been around modern Neretva river, in present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. They were called by Romans \"Vardiaei\".\nOnce an inland tribe, the Ardiaei eventually settled on the Adriatic coast. \nThe ancient geographer, Strabo, lists the Ardiaei as one of the three strongest tribes - the other two being the Autariatae and the Dardani. The whole of the mountainous country that stretches alongside Pannonia from the recess of the Adriatic as far as the Rhizonic Gulf and the land of the Ardiaei is Illyrian, falling as it does between the sea and the Pannonian tribes (Strabon, \"Geographika\", 7. 5. 3).\n\nIn ancient times this river was known as \"Narenta/Naro(n)/Narona\", and the connotation with the name of an Illyrian tribe Narensii seems obvious.\n\n\"Daors\" was the name of an Illyrian tribe. Another name of the tribe was Daversi.\n\nArchaeological research on the Illyrians was used politically as the culture-historical glue of the various groups in the former Yugoslavia. Today the focus is more on the differences between the Illyrian peoples.\nThe neutral term \"Illyrian\" was applied to all ethnic groups in the former Yugoslavia. The Illyrians have been described as warriors, and little focus has been placed on peaceful connections between the Illyrians and the Romans. So it's important to be able to reveal peaceful relations and to show that the Illyrians had come a long way in their cultural contact with other nations, at the same time as there were great differences between the Illyrian tribes. Discovery is therefore important for understanding cultural identities in the Balkans in ancient times.\n\n\n"}

Nearly fifty years later, investigators concluded that the light was a meteor and the creature was a barn owl perched in a tree, with shadows making it appear to be a large humanoid.\n\nAt 7:15 p.m. on September 12, 1952, two brothers, Edward and Fred May, and their friend Tommy Hyer said they saw a bright object cross the sky and land on the property of local farmer G. Bailey Fisher. The boys went to the home of Kathleen May, where they told their story. May, accompanied by the three boys, local children Neil Nunley and Ronnie Shaver, and West Virginia National Guardsman Eugene Lemon, went to the Fisher farm in an effort to locate whatever it was that the boys said they had seen. The group reached the top of a hill, where Nunley said they saw a pulsing red light. Lemon said he aimed a flashlight in that direction and momentarily saw a tall \"man-like figure with a round, red face surrounded by a pointed, hood-like shape\".\n\nDescriptions varied. In an article for \"Fate Magazine\" based on his tape-recorded interviews, UFO writer Gray Barker described the figure as approximately tall, with a round blood-red face, a large pointed \"hood-like shape\" around the face, eye-like shapes which emitted greenish-orange light, and a dark black or green body. Kathleen May described the figure as having \"small, claw-like hands\", clothing-like folds, and \"a head that resembled the ace of spades\". According to the story, when the figure made a hissing sound and \"glided toward the group\", Lemon screamed and dropped his flashlight, causing the group to run away.\nThe group said they had smelled a \"pungent mist\" and some later said they were nauseated. The local sheriff and a deputy had been investigating reports of a crashed aircraft in the area. They searched the site of the reported monster but \"saw, heard and smelled nothing\". According to Barker's account, the next day, A. Lee Stewart, Jr. of the \"Braxton Democrat\" claimed to discover \"skid marks\" in the field and an \"odd, gummy deposit\" which were subsequently attributed by UFO enthusiast groups as evidence of a \"saucer\" landing.\n\nAccording to former news editor Holt Byrne, \"newspaper stories were carried throughout the country, radio broadcasts were carried on large networks, and hundreds of phone calls were received from all parts of the country\". The national press services rated the story \"#11 for the year\". A minister from Brooklyn came to question the May family. A Pittsburgh paper sent a special reporter. UFO and Fortean writers like Gray Barker and Ivan T. Sanderson arrived to investigate.\n\nAfter investigating the case in 2000, Joe Nickell of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) concluded that the bright light in the sky reported by the witnesses on September 12 was most likely a meteor, that the pulsating red light was likely an aircraft navigation/hazard beacon, and that the creature described by witnesses closely resembled an owl. Nickell suggested that witnesses' perceptions were distorted by their heightened state of anxiety. Nickell's conclusions are shared by a number of other investigators, including those of the Air Force.\n\nThe night of the September 12 sighting, a meteor had been observed across three states—Maryland, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. According to Nickell, three flashing red aircraft beacons were also visible from the area of the sightings, which could account for descriptions of a pulsating red light and red tint on the face of the supposed monster.\n\nNickell concluded that the shape, movement, and sounds reported by witnesses were also consistent with the silhouette, flight pattern, and call of a startled barn owl perched on a tree limb, leading researchers to conclude that foliage beneath the owl may have created the illusion of the lower portions of the creature (described as being a pleated green skirt). Researchers also concluded that the witnesses' inability to agree on whether the creature had arms, combined with Kathleen May's report of it having \"small, claw-like hands\" which \"extended in front of it\"\", also matched the description of a barn owl with its talons gripping a tree branch.\n\nAccording to skeptic Ryan Haupt, even though local boy Max Lockard admitted he'd driven around the site \"hoping to see something\" in his Chevy truck, \"paranormal investigators concluded that the tracks, oily residue, and bits of a rubbery substance must have been left by the creature and not the truck\". Haupt explains nausea reported by some of the witnesses as symptoms \"consistent with hysteria and over-exertion\".\n\nLocal officials have erected a \"Welcome to Flatwoods / Home of the Green Monster\" sign on the route leading into the town.\n\nIn celebration of the legend, the Braxton County Convention and Visitor's Bureau built a series of five tall chairs in the shape of the monster to serve as landmarks and visitor attractions. The town of Flatwoods also houses a museum dedicated to the monster legend and offers promotional merchandise. The Bureau rewards visitors who photograph all five chairs with \"Free Braxie\" stickers as part of their ongoing promotion.\n\nThe monster legend is celebrated every year when the town of Flatwoods holds its annual festival called \"Flatwoods Days\". The three-day festival is a weekend of live music, and food and craft vendors.\n\n\n"}

This is opposed to a \"flipped image\", which means an image reversed across a horizontal axis. \"Flopping\" can be used to improve the subjective aesthetic appeal of the image in question.\n\nThere are two main uses in advertising, one practical, and one subjective. On a practical level, images of cars are often flopped to ensure cars look appropriate for left-hand-drive or right-hand-drive markets. This allows the results of a single production shoot to be used across markets, allowing a cost saving. On a subjective level, the direction in which a person is looking or a car appears to be travelling may be regarded as important. When placing a picture on a page of text, it is usual for depictions of people to face into the text, rather than off the page; thus, when compositing a page, a picture may be flopped so it may be placed either side of a column of text.\n\nCultural considerations come into play — a picture of a person eating with their left hand may be flopped for publication in a Muslim publication, due to the strong taboo against eating with the left hand in Muslim society. Similarly, Vincent van Gogh took the trouble to etch some of his originals in mirror-reversed form so that when printed, people in the image would appear, correctly, as right-handed.\n\nAn example of \"flopping\" is the use of Joseph Edward Southall's painting \"Fishermen and Boat\" as part of the art associated with Kate Bush's album Aerial. The picture is flopped, and the name \"AERIAL\" added to the boat.\n\nA common movie blooper is a flopped image, usually and erroneously called \"flipped images\". Flopped images are common because they can be used to correct continuity errors between shots and are hard to see without extensive examination, whereas flipped images are very obvious. Examples of these can be found on several movie blooper sites.\n\nOne of the most famous flopped images is this picture of Billy the Kid carrying a Model 1873 Winchester rifle and a pistol belt with the pistol on his left. This led people to believe he was left-handed, but it was later revealed to be a flopped image due to the cartridge loading gate on the rifle being on the wrong side.\n\n"}

Pekar and Budgett began working together in 1974; before \"American Splendor\", Budgett illustrated a couple of short Pekar stories (one of them in partnership with Dumm) in the underground comix anthologies \"Bizarre Sex\" and \"Flaming Baloney X\".\n\nFrom 1976 until 1988, Budgett illustrated stories in Pekar's autobiographical comics series, \"American Splendor\". Budgett was one of Pekar's most frequent early collaborators; most of his stories were inked by Dumm. Budgett drew a number of \"American Splendor\" covers as well, including issues #2, 3, 7, 8, 11, and 13. \n\nDuring the 1980s, Budgett and Dumm worked on stories in \"Dr. Wirtham's Comix & Stories\", an underground/alternative comics series published by Clifford Neal, as well as a number of other alternative and independent comic book series. In the early 1990s, Budgett and Dumm co-wrote and drew stories for Eternity Comics' \"Plan 9 From Outer Space: Thirty Years Later\" and their own erotic series \"Shooty Beagle\" and \"Woofers & Hooters\" (both with Eros Comix).\n\nBy the early 1990s, Budgett had \"de-emphasized cartooning\" and didn't work in the industry again until 2004, when (at the urging of Gary Dumm) he illustrated another Pekar story in the 2004 collection \"American Splendor: Our Movie Year\".

It sets out a history of moral philosophy and presents new ideas in ethics, which have been described as quasi-utilitarianism.\n\n\"How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time\" has forty chapters, which are grouped into six parts.\n\nFor ethical advice to be credible, the book says it cannot be perceived as arbitrary. The book cites The Dice Man – a man who makes choices based on dice rolls – as an example of advice-following which is arbitrary and so cannot be regarded as ethical.\n\nChapter three argues intuitions about what we should do can be more useful, but are undermined because our multiple intuitions often lead to contradictory advice (e.g. ‘help a stranger’ or ‘put family first’?). Philosophers have sought to eliminate these contradictions by locating right and wrong in a single part of the decision-making process: for example, in the actions we take (e.g. Kant), in our character (e.g. Aristotle, virtue ethics) or in the consequences of our actions (e.g. Utilitarianism).\n\nChapter four explains how ‘do whatever is best’ (utilitarianism) still dominates modern philosophical and economic thinking.\n\nChapter five cites seven faults with utilitarianism. These are that it can be self-defeating; that it considers only future events and ignores the past; that it places decision-making authority in questionable hands; that it doesn’t discriminate fairly between people; that it sacrifices individual concerns to the group interest; that it down-grades promises, fairness and truth-telling; and that it doesn’t offer any clear rules. The chapter also argues that the main argument for utilitarianism is invalid, and ‘empty’.\n\nPart II starts with a secular revision of Pascal’s Wager, arguing “What does it hurt to pursue value and virtue? If there is value, then we have everything to gain, but if there is none, then we haven’t lost anything.” Thus, it rationally makes sense for us to pursue something of value.\n\nIt says that “people ultimately derive their choices from what they want to do and what other people want to do” \n\nIt then presents four different arguments for deriving a basic principle from which right and wrong can be developed. These are an adaptation of utilitarianism; an adaptation of John Rawls' theory; an argument from evolutionary theory; and a 'Sherlock Holmes' approach.\n\nAll four arguments converge on empathy, obligation and the ‘Help Principle’, which the book argues are kernels of a viable ethical system. According to Audrey Tang, King's philosophy advocates: \"If spending one unit of your effort could help another person by two units, he detailed in his book, you should help.\"\n\nPart III defines the Help Principle more carefully, with a section on autonomy, and a critique of the golden rule.\n\nIt results in an approach to ethics which combines deontology, consequentialism and virtue ethics. This has been described as quasi-utilitarianism.\n\nPart IV attempts to distinguish white lies from bad lies. Contradicting Aristotle, who believed no general rule on lying was possible, 'For he who advocates lying can never be believed or trusted,' and St Augustine, who believed all lies were sinful, the book presents a definition of good lies, and argues why it is credible and superior.\n\nChapters 28 and 29 reconcile individual human rights with group interests. Both individual justice and social justice feature.\n\nPart V deals with situations when information is not certain, and other real world problems which are absent from much academic philosophy. These problems make effective altruism impractical and rare.\n\nChapter 34 argues that the notion of integrity can only make sense in ethics if it is applied to the consequences people allow to happen rather than to people themselves.\n\nPart VI claims a hybrid system can be internally-consistent and address several problems of the main schools of ethics.\n\nChapter 40 concludes it is impossible to make good decisions all the time because we can never know enough about the world, and the consequences of our actions. Hence, ethics can never emulate the scientific revolution by offering a simple set of rules for every situation, similar to those derived by Newton. This is because Newton’s own rules can never be applied perfectly, because we can never know how the world really is.\n\nIt was published on December 1, 2008. It became a bestseller within the category of philosophy books in 2013.\n\nThe book answers the Frege–Geach Problem, the Fact–Value Gap, and the Open Question Argument, although the given answers have been challenged.\n\nThe book has been used to reconcile utilitarian and rules-based ethics. \n\nHumanist psychologists have used the book to explain why only proven phenomena is needed to prove why morality exists, and what the parameters of morality should be. Theists have commented on the way the book grounds ethics without recourse to religion.\n\nThe book has been used in freshman philosophy classes, to teach teenagers, and in SATs.\n\n"}

When these men returned to England in 1805, they brought with them thousands of specimens and hundreds of sketches. Initially, they planned to publish a large-scale work, to be entitled \"Illustrationes florae Novae Hollandiae\", but this venture failed, and Brown decided to publish his scientific descriptions separately, in \"Transactions of the Linnean Society of London\", and later his own \"Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen\". Bauer then undertook to publish a lesser work himself, with Brown providing text limited to a brief preface and some captioning.\n\nUnusually, Bauer not only did all the illustrations, but also engraved the printing plates and hand-coloured the illustrations. It was exceedingly unusual for a single artist to perform all three roles; it is said that Bauer did the engraving himself because he could not find a good engraver, and previous works of his were disappointing because of incompetent engraving.\n\nThree issues of \"Illustrationes florae Novae Hollandiae\" were published, all in 1813. These three issues totalled fifteen plates, and a sixteenth was bound into some copies. Publication then ceased, probably because the venture was a financial failure. It is estimated that less than fifty copies of the work were sold, and some of these were uncoloured. It is therefore now an extremely rare book. In 1997, a copy was sold at Christie's for $57,000.\n\n"}
{"id": "1922922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922922", "title": "Imparja Television", "text": "Imparja Television\n\nImparja Television (IMP) is an Australian television station servicing remote eastern and central Australia, that began broadcasting on 2 January 1988. It is based in Alice Springs, where it has a studio and satellite uplink facility. Notably, it is controlled by Australian Aboriginals through ownership by Imparja Television Pty Ltd, and is widely regarded as a symbol of Aboriginal Australia. Most viewers receive Imparja via free to view satellite transmission, whilst a smaller proportion receive it via analogue terrestrial transmission.\n\n\"Imparja\" is an Arrernte word meaning footprints. The word is used to represent that Imparja Television aims to service Arrente people wherever they may live, from Mutitjulu to King's Canyon to Alice Springs to Tennant Creek and beyond. They describe their range as a footprint.\n\nIn 2008, Imparja Television was identified on-air and in print as Nine Imparja, following its dropping of Network Ten affiliation. In 2009, the station again identifies as simply \"Imparja\" and \"IMP\", although the Nine Network's nine dots seen in the logo still remain.\n\nThe then Australian Broadcasting Tribunal was asked by the Federal Minister for Communications in October 1984 to inquire into the allocation of commercial television licences for a number of remote areas. Licences were granted in 1985 to the Golden West Network, which broadcast to Western Australia, and QSTV in north-eastern Australia.\n\nIn 1986 hearings for the allocation of the licence began, and the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association (CAAMA), which began providing Central Australian radio programs in local languages in 1980, formed Imparja Television Pty Ltd as a company. Soon after, the Government of the Northern Territory announced support to underpin the viability of the Central Zone Remote Television Service (RCTS) by offering to purchase an estimated $2 million package of services from the successful applicant. The Government of South Australia undertook a similar promise, offering loans of $1 million to Imparja if they were successful. An extraordinary saga of political, legal and commercial intrigue then ensued during the protracted Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) hearing process, pitching Federal, State and Territory Governments against one another with loan promises being substantially watered down or withdrawn as it became apparent the CAAMA application may prevail. Windfall funding from the Australian Bicentennial Authority and the Aboriginal Development Commission ultimately underpinned the feasibility of the CAAMA bid and they were successfully allocated the licence. However subsequent Federal Administrative Tribunal court proceedings brought about by the unsuccessful applicant, Darwin based Territory Television Ltd., attempting to overturn the ABT's decision delayed construction commencement of the new service until May 1987.\n\nBy October 1987 the new station had begun to build rebroadcast sites and new studios and a main transmitter based in Alice Springs were completed. Imparja's first test program, \"Australia versus Sri Lanka Test Cricket\", was telecast on 2 January 1988 in Alice Springs. Two weeks later, on 15 January 1988, the station was officially inaugurated at Imparja Television's head office in Alice Springs by Minister for Communications Ralph Willis and Warren Snowdon, the Australian federal member of parliament for the Division of Lingiari in Northern Territory.\n\nImparja became the first Aboriginal member of the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations and the now-defunct Regional Television Association, both dominant organisations at the time.\n\nImparja was chaired by Freda Glynn for its first 10 years and, for a time, she was the only female chair of a television network in the world. Freda was one of the first three founders of CAAMA – the others being John Macumba and Philip Batty.\n\nImparja had an initial population reach of 62,000 people, which by 1993 had grown to 125,000. Imparja was available through retransmission sites at Ceduna, Coober Pedy, Leigh Creek and Woomera in South Australia, and Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, Katherine and Bathurst Island in the Northern Territory, as well as on the Optus Aurora satellite platform.\n\nImparja initially carried programming from all three major Australian commercial television networks, but following aggregation of market area with QSTV, it affiliated with the Nine Network and Network Ten. Imparja also screened some ABC Television and SBS Television indigenous programs, all in addition to original programs commissioned by the station.\n\nIn 1990, \"Imparja Local News\" was launched as a fifteen-minute insert of local news into the national bulletin. The station also covered the Northern Territory general election live from its Alice Springs studios. This followed the lead taken in 1989 when the station began to produce weather reports for parts of the Northern Territory, South Australia and New South Wales, presented by Lavinia Hampton.\n\nBy 1993, Imparja's viewing audience had doubled to approximately 125,000 Australians. This in turn led to the increased allocation of government funding in 1994 to produce \"Yamba's Playtime\", which was the station's first in-house televisual production. Yamba's Playtime features the station's official mascot, \"Yamba\". Also in 1994, the Imparja board of directors established the Imparja Business Development Sub Committee, to monitor and provide strategic recommendations for areas of growth for the company.\n\nIn 1995, Imparja received the Telstra Indigenous Business Award for Business of the Year. Also in 1995, Imparja's satellite transmission moved from the Aussat A-Class satellites to the Optus B1 satellite, and the station's licence was renewed.\n\nTwo new in-house productions were launched in 1996. The first being the \"BRACS Program\", which was almost fully produced by Aboriginal communities, and \"Corroboree Rock\", an Aboriginal music program.\n\nImparja's parent company, Imparja Pty Ltd, converted to a proprietary company in 1997, whilst in the late 1990s, Imparja moved to digital satellite technology on the Optus Aurora platform. This meant that Imparja's satellite transmission moved from the Optus B1 satellite to the Optus C1 satellite.\n\nBy 2001 the station's coverage area had grown to include over 430,000 people. Around this time 'Imparja Info Channel' ('Channel 31') was launched, providing additional programming, news, and community information to remote Aboriginal communities. The Aboriginal programming on this channel later became known as Indigenous Community Television (ICTV). In 2007, the whole channel was replaced by National Indigenous Television (NITV).\n\nImparja faced criticism by a number of community groups in 2004, following the station's decision to introduce advertising for alcohol for the first time. The network pledged to donate 30% of the total income received from alcohol advertising towards alcohol and substance abuse programs in communities.\n\nIn 2005, \"Imparja National News\", which primarily covered the news in Alice Springs in addition to other national and international news stories, was axed. The move was taken in anticipation of the Remote Eastern & Central Australia TV1 licence area being merged with that of Darwin. Regulations imposed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority relating to minimum levels of local news coverage led to 2006 reinstatement of \"Imparja National News\". The news service began broadcasting again from the middle of February 2006, with Ryan Liddle as presenter.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, it was widely expected that the Australian Communications and Media Authority would merge the \"Darwin\" and \"Remote Eastern and Central Australia\" commercial television licence areas. This would have most likely seen Imparja Television become a Network Ten affiliate in Darwin. However, this did not eventuate. Instead PBL Media and Southern Cross Broadcasting, the two existing Darwin Commercial licence holders were invited to bid individually or together. Their successful joint bid used a company called Darwin Digital Television.\n\nOn 3 February 2008, Imparja Television updated its logo removing the emblem, which had been present on the logo for two decades. The logo change coincided with Imparja dropping Network Ten affiliation, becoming a sole Nine Network affiliate, in addition to axing \"Imparja National News\", and also adding Nine Network's dots to its new logo.\n\nOn 19 May 2010, the ACMA (Australian Communications and Media Authority) approved a licence for a new remote area digital-only TV channel, a joint venture by Imparja Pty Ltd and Southern Cross Central. It was launched on 30 June 2010 as \"Ten Central (CDT)\". It had two feeds, Ten Central North (QLD/NT) and Ten Central South (NSW/SA/Vic/Tas).\n\nIn December 2010, Imparja Television began broadcasting on terrestrial digital TV and the new VAST satellite service. This expansion included the establishment of two feeds for these platforms, Imparja North (Qld/NT) and Imparja South (NSW/SA/Vic/Tas). As of 2010, their programming is exactly the same.\n\nImparja Pty Ltd also began to launch digital channels GO! and GEM.\n\nAs of the moment, Imparja continues to stream the HD feed of 9Gem, which was rebranded as a standard definition channel in Nine Network-only on 26 November 2015 in its metropolitan and Darwin stations, along with 9Life and the relaunch of 9HD. There are currently no plans at this stage for Imparja to launch an HD simulcast or introduce 9Life to its viewers. It will continue with its existing lineup of three broadcast channels.\n\nImparja Television is a sole Nine Network affiliate. The station previously broadcast both Nine and Ten programming, however it stopped broadcasting Network Ten programming on 3 February 2008. Imparja Television has also aired original programs produced by local Aboriginal community members, such as Bush Mechanics and the children's program \"Yamba's Playtime\". Imparja also airs programming relating to local Australian rules football and community sports, as well as news updates and religious \"thought for the day\" programs. Imparja Television also regularly broadcasts films created by the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association, which is a shareholder of its parent company.\n\nImparja's programming schedule is currently based on the Nine Network schedule for Brisbane (based on Eastern Standard Time). Prior to February 2008, scheduling was generally based on Central Standard Time, reflecting its Alice Springs-based heritage. As a result, programs are now broadcast half an hour earlier than they previously would have been under the previous arrangement.\n\nImparja does not currently produce its own evening regional news bulletin. In 2008, Imparja replaced \"Imparja National News\" – a 30-minute, weeknightly program combining local and national/international news – with local news updates, plus a 30-minute local news magazine program, \"Footprints\" (which later ceased production in 2009). The news updates were presented by Emma Groves from 2014 until July 2016. This brings Imparja's daily news service roughly into line with its competitor in the Remote Eastern and Central Australia licence area, Southern Cross Central (QQQ).\n\nThe 6:00 pm (AEST) time slot is filled by a simulcast of \"Nine News Queensland\". Imparja cites its geographic distribution, with a majority of the remote licence area's viewers now located in Queensland, as a \"key factor\" in selecting the Queensland bulletin. In 2009 Imparja began airing the Darwin edition of Nine News live at 6:30 pm (AEST) on weekdays, immediately following the Brisbane edition, in place of \"A Current Affair\" – thereby restoring a Northern Territory-based bulletin to the station.\n\nImparja airs most sports coverage from the Nine Network, including rugby league, cricket, golf and tennis. The station also broadcast motorsport and Australian rules football coverage until 2008.\n\nImparja Television broadcasts throughout most of the Northern Territory, and also to some remote parts of Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria, Tasmania and Norfolk Island. It is generally available by satellite on the VAST or Optus Aurora platforms, though in some locations it is broadcast terrestrially. Imparja Television has the largest geographic range of any commercial television network in Australia. Imparja is also received on the Spirit of Tasmania Bass Strait Ferries.\n\nImparja Television was previously available in New Zealand until March 2008 when the New Zealand government pressured the Australian government to remove the service from the satellite footprint that includes New Zealand.\n\nThe total population serviced by Imparja Television is over 700,000 people, boasting the largest footprint in the southern hemisphere.\n\nImparja is also available in Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea through the HiTRON subscription television service.\n\nImparja Television's first logo was developed from a painting produced by an Arrernte artist and traditional owner. The logo symbolised the MacDonnell Ranges, the Todd River and the Yeperenye caterpillar. An updated version designed by Bruce Dunlop Associates debuted on 30 January 2006, adding a blue sphere behind the emblem. When Imparja re-affiliated with Nine Network, the long-time emblem was replaced by the Nine Network dots.\n\n"}

Jeff Chandler, Charles Drake, Agnes Moorehead, Larry Gates, Virginia Grey, Gene Lockhart and Murray Hamilton co-star.\n\nMany aspects of Eagels' real life were omitted or largely fictionalized. Eagels' family later sued Columbia Pictures over the way Eagels was depicted in the film.\n\nJeanne Eagels is a Kansas City waitress. After losing a carnival's beauty contest, she asks carny owner Sal Satori for a job. Her dancing in a skimpy costume is accused of being obscene. Sal decides to join his brother in New York and invites Jeanne to join them in an amusement park at Coney Island.\n\nTaking acting lessons instead, the ambitious Jeanne becomes the understudy in a Broadway show and a star when she gets a chance to play the part. A once successful actress named Elsie Desmond wants to make a comeback in a new play, but Jeanne betrays her and takes the play for herself, willing to do anything to get ahead. Elsie denounces her in the theater before the first performance, then commits suicide. Sal is disgusted by Jeanne's behavior as well. She accepts a proposal from a ne'er-do-well named John Donahue, but both descend into alcoholism. Jeanne misses performances and causes fellow actors to lose out on paychecks.\n\nHer situation deteriorates further when she's required to pay alimony to John after a divorce. A new play fails because Jeanne, drunk and on pills, collapses on stage. The actors' guild suspends her for 18 months. Unable to work, she returns to Sal's amusement park and is offered a job dancing. Another performer sexually assaults her in a dressing room. Jeanne, her life in ruins, continues to spiral downward and hallucinate. While trying to make it to a stage one night, she collapses on the staircase and dies.\n\nThe film was long planned as a vehicle for Kim Novak. Jeff Chandler had just finished a long term exclusive contract with Universal and played the male lead.\n\nNovak's dress caught on fire during filming and Chandler had to put it out.\n\n\nSony Pictures Home Entertainment released \"Jeanne Eagels\" on August 3, 2010, as part of its \"Kim Novak Collection.\" The box set also includes the films \"Picnic\" (1956); \"Bell, Book and Candle\" (1958); \"Middle of the Night\" (1959); and \"Pal Joey\" (1957).\n\n\n"}

Born at Lille (a city in the County of Flanders, then under Habsburg rule), he was a priest and canon of St. Peter's Church, Leuven, where he died.\n\nHe wrote numerous books, several only published posthumously. He is best known for his \"De Picturis et Imaginibus Sacris, pro vero earum usu contra abusus\" (\"Treatise on Sacred Images\"). This was published in 1570, four years after the Iconoclastic Fury had swept through the Low Countries, and it defended the production and use of devotional images, but enforcing the restrictions of the Council of Trent, as he interpreted them, in a brutally polemical fashion, which was very influential. Five further, enlarged, editions of this appeared between 1594 and 1771, and a modern French translation was published in 1996. He was also lead editor of an edition of the works of Saint Augustine (Antwerp, Plantin Press, 1566–1577), and wrote a manuscript history of Louvain that was printed in two volumes in 1861, edited by P. F. X. de Ram.\n\nMolanus was born in Lille, in Walloon Flanders, in 1533, the son of Hendrik Vermeulen and Anna Peters. His father was from Holland and his mother from Brabant.\n\nHe matriculated at Louvain University on 27 February 1554, graduating in the Liberal Arts in 1558 and as Doctor of Theology in 1570. He became a canon of St. Peter's Church, Leuven, and a professor of Theology, serving both as dean of the Faculty of Theology and as rector of the university. In 1579 he was appointed president of King's College.\n\nMolanus died in Louvain on 18 September 1585, having made bequests in favour of the college over which he had presided.\n\nMolanus is today mainly remembered by art historians for being one of the first authorities to turn the Council of Trent's short and inexplicit decrees on sacred images (1563) into minutely detailed instructions for artists, which were then widely enforced in Catholic countries mostly. His views on the older, originally Byzantine, depiction of the Nativity of Jesus in art are typical:\nThe Virgin is shown pale with pains, the midwives prepare a small (narcotic) drought for the childbirth. Why this? Is it because the Virgin Mary would have held back from any pain of childbirth, when in fact she brought forth her divine son without pain? And what pertains to the midwives who are mentioned in the apocryphal Book of the Infancy? Jerome says: There was no midwife! No obtrusiveness of women intervened! She, the Virgin, was both mother and midwife! I saw in not a few places the picture of the blessed Virgin lying on a bed, depicting childbirth, and she was suffering pains from this birth, but that is not true. How stupid! Those artists ought to be laughed at who paint Mary in the very act of childbirth pains, accompanied with pain, midwife, bed, little knives (to cut the umbilical cord), with hot compresses, and many other appurtenances. . . . Rather, those pictures should be promoted which show the birth of Christ in which the Blessed Virgin Mary with arms folded and on bended knee before her little son, as though he was just now brought forth into the light.\nHe objected on similar grounds to the \"Death of the Virgin\", her swooning at the foot of the Cross, and her being shown supplicating Christ for mankind in \"Last Judgement\" scenes. She would, he said, in fact be sitting alongside Christ in stern judgement:\n\nMany painters show Mary and John the Baptist kneeling beside Our lord at the Last Judgment...But we may not think that at that day the Virgin Mary will kneel for us before the Judge, baring her breast to intercede for sinners. Nor may we think that John the Baptist will fall upon his knees to beg mercy for mankind in the way the painters show. Rather, the blessed Virgin and St. John shall sit beside the supreme Judge as assessors. The mercy which is extended now will have no place then. There will only be strict justice at that day.\n\nAlso condemned were Saint Christopher as a giant carrying Christ (and as the protector of travellers), Saint George and the Dragon, the Holy Kinship, the unicorn hunt in the Hortus Conclusus and many other depictions not verifiable from reliable sources – the \"Golden Legend\" was, he said, in fact of \"lead\".\n\nNudity, even of the infant Jesus, was to be avoided as much as possible, and drapes must cover the genitals where it could not be. Whilst condemning older depictions without a scriptural basis, he was not hesitant in creating new ones based on his own interpretation. Saint Joseph should not be shown as the old, semi-comical figure of the Middle Ages, but as young, vigorous and firmly in control of the Holy Family. Mary Magdalene should not be shown as an over-dressed prostitute, and generally dress should be simple. He opposed showing the Swooning Virgin Mary in scenes of \"Christ carrying the Cross\" or the Crucifixion itself.\n\n\n"}

From 1856 he went into practice with his father Charles, drawing details for houses.\n\nBy 1858 he had opened his own office in Edinburgh, later becoming architect to the Merchant Company of Edinburgh, involving work to the city's schools. He was the principal architect to the Royal Bank of Scotland from 1861 (succeeding David Rhind), designing bank branches for Dunfermline, Kilmarnock, Montrose, and many others. From 1862 he employed Thomas Ross as his assistant, making him a partner and establishing MacGibbon and Ross ten years later. \n\nIn 1865 MacGibbon married Jessie Vannan Rintoul, and acquired the estate of Laggan, Ballantrae, from his father. After 1867 they built a new house on the estate (Gurphur, since demolished), and also purchased a house in the Dean Village area of Edinburgh. Later, a larger house was built at Ashfield in Grange Loan. These properties had to be sold in the early 1880s following the crash of the City of Glasgow Bank, to avoid the bankruptcy of MacGibbon's cousins. \n\nIn 1880 he was elected president of the Edinburgh Architectural Association, and gave lectures on the architecture of Scottish castles and country houses. He had been making field visits and sketching for some years, building up a first-hand knowledge of the topic. It was these surveys and papers which formed the basis for the publication of \"The castellated and domestic architecture of Scotland\".\n\nWhile on holiday in July 1884, MacGibbon's son William was killed and his daughter Rachel permanently injured when a sandbank collapsed on them. Rachel's lungs were affected and the family were forced to move to the French Riviera to aid her recovery. he continued sketching, publishing \"The Architecture of the Riviera\" in 1888. Returning to Scotland, he continued his surveys for the continuing publication of \"The castellated and domestic architecture of Scotland\" and \"The ecclesiastical architecture of Scotland\". He began a parallel project on the continent with his son Alfred in the 1890s, although this never reached fruition. His workload brought on a heart condition which worsened over the next years. Although he published \"The Five Great Churches of Galloway\" in 1899, by that year he was too ill to attend the University of St Andrews to accept an honorary degree. \n\nIn later life he was living with his family at 23 Learmonth Terrace, whilst his office (with Ross) was at 65 Frederick Street in Edinburgh's New Town.\n\nHe died in 1902, survived by his wife and son, and three daughters. He is buried in the north-west section of the northern (19th century) extension to Dean Cemetery in western Edinburgh. His grave is both very small and somewhat damaged. It has been moved back to rest against the much larger grave of his wife Jessie.\n\nThomas Ross was the son of a farmer, also Thomas Ross, and Ann Murray. He was born at Wardheads, Errol, and attended local schools before going to Glasgow around 1855 to work as an assistant to architect Alexander Kirkland. He soon moved to the office of Charles Wilson, winning a measured drawing competition during his time there. He spent the proceeds on a study trip to Yorkshire, visiting Fountains Abbey among other sites.\n\nIn 1862 he began as an assistant to David MacGibbon in Edinburgh, and was made a partner in the firm of MacGibbon and Ross in 1872. Soon after this he married Mary MacLaren. Ross began sketching the architecture of Scotland along with his senior partner, contributing to the latter's public lectures, and culminating in the pair's major publications. After MacGibbon's removal to the continent, Ross managed the practice alone, and also continued to make sketching trips for their ongoing publications. The books brought in many commissions for restoration work, but many schemes were never realised, and business declined generally.\n\nAfter MacGibbon's death in 1902, his place was taken by his son Alfred. Ross himself was appointed as a founder commissioner of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland in 1908, and was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Edinburgh in 1910. He gave the Rhind lectures in 1899, on Scottish architecture. Fred MacGibbon was later appointed architect to the RCAHMS, but was diagnosed as diabetic and resigned in 1914, dissolving the practice. He died the following year.\n\nRoss continued alone until 1916, when he retired to his home in Saxe-Coburg Place, Edinburgh, occasionally undertaking small commissions. He was arrested in 1915 for sketching in a prohibited area, while studying Rossend Castle in Fife, and fined five shillings. In 1918 he was elected to the Royal Scottish Academy as Professor of Antiquities. \n\nHe died three years after his wife, at the age of 91, and was survived by his son James MacLaren Ross, also an architect, and two daughters. He is buried in Comely Bank Cemetery in north Edinburgh.\n\nThese surveys include history, descriptions, sketches and measured plans, of buildings throughout the country, every one visited in person. Their published works are still considered definitive today, comprising as they do a \"totally comprehensive survey of Scottish architecture prior to the Restoration.\"\n\n\n"}

The term was first used in 1987 by Patricia Hart to describe the works of Isabel Allende. More recent critical works on the subject feature such scholars as Ricci-James Adams or Kimberley Ann Wells. The term \"magical feminism\" refers to magical realism in a feminist discourse. Magical realism's basic assumption is the coexistence and effective merging of contradictory worldviews, the scientific and rational with the spiritual and magical. It grants equal ontological status to real figures and spirits, everyday occurrences and supernatural events. In its nature then is the subversion of monolithic cultural, social and political structures. It is a mode perfect for the writers who are \"in between\", especially the postcolonial ones.\n\nSeen from the post-colonial perspective the magic and supernatural elements serve to disrupt reality giving voice to the Other, the oppressed groups. In the case of magical feminism the role of The Other is assumed by the marginalized women. The strategies of defamiliarization, supernaturalization, grotesque, intertextuality, are used to undermine the fossilized schemata and oppressive mechanisms of patriarchal domination and to create a space in which an independent version of identity and history can be manifested.\n\nMagical feminism is popular among representatives of ethnic literature of the United States who operate in a hybrid culture and a hybrid language. They are for example Ana Castillo, Maria Helena Viramontes, Kathleen Alcalá, but also female authors from other parts of the world such as British writer Jeanette Winterson or Polish author Olga Tokarczuk.\n\nKimberley Ann Wells claims that the most important feature of this genre is the presence of a female magic user, most commonly a witch or a shamaness, metaphorically representing the female protest against the male-dominated world order and an act of independence.\n\n\n"}

He was a specialist in Early Netherlandish painting and the Northern Renaissance, who volunteered at the \"Kupferstichkabinett\" or prints collection of the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin in 1891 under Friedrich Lippmann. On Lippmann's recommendation, Wilhelm von Bode took him on as his assistant in 1896 for the paintings division. He was appointed deputy director under Bode in 1904 and became director himself from 1924 to 1932, working on his history \"From Van Eyck to Bruegel\" and the 14-volume (printed in 16, with supplements) survey \"Early Netherlandish Painting\". He also donated several works to the collection and worked in the art trade as an advisor, to Hermann Göring among others. He moved to Amsterdam in 1939. He attained the rank and title of geheimrat (privy councillor) under the German Empire.\n\nFriedländer's approach to art history was essentially that of a connoisseur. He gave priority to a critical reading based on sensitivity rather than on grand artistic and or aesthetic theories. He described it as follows: If the determination of the authorship of an individual work of art most certainly is not the ultimate and highest task of artistic erudition; even if it were no path to the goal: nevertheless, without a doubt, it is a school for the eye, since there is no formulation of a question which forces us to penetrate so deeply the essence of an individual work as that concerning the identity of the author. The individual work, rightly understood, teaches us what a comprehensive knowledge universal artistic activity is incapable of teaching us.\n\nDuring his lifetime he took high quality photographs of artwork wherever he travelled. His personal archive with approximately 15,000 photos and reproductions of 15th- and 16th-century paintings from the North and South Netherlands are often accompanied with notes including such things as the provenance, attribution, relative condition, and location of the paintings. The majority of his work has been transcribed and digitised in the RKDimages database of the Dutch National Institute of Art History (RKD) and forms an important open access archive for art historians.\n\n\n\n"}

Gossels was named a Copley Artist in 1996 by the prestigious Copley Society of Art. She is also co-editor of the first egalitarian Jewish prayer book, \"Vetaher Libenu\", published in 1980.\n\nBorn in Norwich, Connecticut, Gossels was raised in Putnam, Connecticut by her parents, Benjamin and Sadie Tuber. She received a Bachelor of Arts degree (magna cum laude) from Pembroke College (Brown University) and was elected into the Phi Beta Kappa Society. In 1958, she married C. Peter R. Gossels. They have three children: Lisa R. Gossels, who was honored by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences in 2001 which awarded her an Emmy for her film, \"The Children of Chabannes\"; Amy D. Gossels, a casting director, film producer and teacher; and Daniel J. Gossels, an investment banker.\n\nGossels worked at \"The Atlantic Monthly\" from 1956 to 1958. Gossels subsequently served as associate editor of \"Child Life Magazine\" from 1958 to 1960 and as a reporter and columnist for the \"Cochituate/Wayland/Weston Town Crier\" from 1962 to 1964.\n\nGossels began her artistic career as a painter, but over time found that her painting was becoming more and more sculptural. In 1986, Gossels and Brenda Zaltas exchanged ideas about designing outdoor sculptures from found metal, discovered that the metal shapes reminded them of menorahs and embarked on a new career. Although they worked separately, they shared a vision and often showed their work together in art exhibits and galleries.\n\nSince the late 1980s, Gossels has received national attention for her unique \"found metal\" sculptures, both religious and non-religious, which \"have been shown in museums, galleries and selected juried exhibitions\" across the U.S., including the Bronx Museum of the Arts, Yeshiva University Museum, the National Museum of American Jewish History in Philadelphia, Mizel Museum in Denver, and the Flagler Museum in Palm Beach.\n\nIn 1988, the In the Spirit Studio / Gallery in New York City featured her aluminum and brass menorah titled, \"Brave New World\". McCalls featured Gossels' \"Reflections\", a Chanukah lamp with bronze mirror back, in its December 1990 article, \"The Art of the Menorah.\"\n\nAt the General Assembly of the Council of Jewish Federations, Combined Jewish Philanthropies included a gift shop that displayed \"unique Jewish artworks from throughout the world,\" including Gossels' menorah works created from industrial metals.\n\nIn 1996 Gossels was named a \"Copley Artist\" by the Copley Society of Art, the oldest art association in America. In order to qualify for this honor, an artist must meet the demanding standards for membership in the society and must have his or her work accepted into five different juried shows produced by the society.\n\nGossels received her art training at the DeCordova Museum School in Lincoln, Massachusetts. She also took classes with Boston area artists Glenda Tall and George Dergalis.\n\nHer works are also represented in a growing number of private collections.\n\nIn addition to her sculpture, Gossels is a poet. According to an interview in the \"Wayland Town Crier\", designing sculptural pieces made her realize \"the connection between the written word and the visual piece.\"\n\nWhile serving as a member of the National Commission on Worship of the Jewish reform movement between 1976 and 1980 and as Vice President of Congregation Beth El of the Sudbury River Valley in Sudbury, Massachusetts, Gossels composed and edited (with Joan S. Kaye and her husband, C. Peter R. Gossels) the first egalitarian Jewish prayer book for the Sabbath and Festivals, \"Vetaher Libenu\", which was published in 1980. Among the many innovations contained in \"Vetaher Libenu\", Nancy Lee Gossels and Joan S. Kaye revised the traditional Hebrew translation of \"Barukh atah Adonai Eloheinu, melekh ha’olam,\" or \"Praised are You, Adonai our God, Ruler to the Universe,\" to \"Holy One of Blessing, Your Presence Fills Creation.\" This invocation is now used by many Reform congregations.\n\nThis siddur, which has sold more than 10,000 copies worldwide, contains many liturgical poems written by Gossels (including her well-known poem, \"Somewhere Out of Time\"), which have been widely republished, translated into German, anthologized and included in the \"Singing the Living Tradition,\" hymnal of the Unitarian Universalism Association.\n\nGossels' poetry has also been included in the anthologies, \"Sarah's Daughters Sing\", \"Esther erhebt ihre Stimme\", \"Kol HaNeshamah\", \"Celebrating the New Moon\", \"The Torah: A Woman's Commentary,\", \"Covenant of the Generations\", and \"Gates of Shabbat: A Guide for Observing Shabbat\".\n\nGossels served as the editor of \"Chadesh Yamenu\" (Renew Our Days), an egalitarian machzor for Rosh HaShanah, published in 1997 and \"Kanfay HaShachar\" (Wings of Dawn), a siddur for weekly morning worship published in 2003.\n\nIn 2011, Gossels co-edited \"Veha'er Eyneynu\" (Enlighten Our Eyes) with Michael Mirman, Harry Abadi and Sheila R. Deitchman.\n\nFrom 1976 to 1977, Gossels served as committee chair of the building committee for Congregation Beth El of the Sudbury River Valley. In this capacity, she oversaw the enlargement of the temple building.\n\nIn 2005, Gossels was honored by the Massachusetts Association of School Committees for her commitment to public education and her generosity of time, energy and support to enhance the educational opportunities of students at Wayland High School by creating and endowing the Gossels Fund for Academic Excellence and the Gossels Fund for Human Dignity.\n\nGossels served as a trustee of the Exploration School from 2001 to 2011, a summer enrichment program for approximately 3,000 students from Grade 4 through high school on the campuses of the St. Mark's School (Massachusetts), Wellesley College and Yale University.\n\nShe currently serves as a member of the board of directors of the Boston Jewish Film Festival and Temple Shir Tikva in Wayland, Massachusetts.\n\n"}

It stands in a block surrounded by Victoria Street, Crosshall Street, Whitechapel, and Peter Street. After it closed as a warehouse it was converted into a conservation centre for National Museums Liverpool in the 1990s. Initially its exhibition area was open to the public, but this closed in 2010. The centre is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building.\n\nThe warehouse was built as a depot for the storage of railway freight in 1872 for the Midland Railway. It was designed by the local architect Henry Sumners of Culshaw and Sumners. The building was extended along Peter Street in 1878 in a similar architectural style. Between 1995 and 1996 it was converted by another local architect, Ken Martin, into the Conservation Centre for National Museums Liverpool. In addition to its conservation work, the centre had an exhibition area open to the public to demonstrate the techniques of conservation, which attracted 60,000 visitors a year. In September 2005 the centre closed for refurbishment, and re-opened in June 2006 as the National Conservation Centre. Because of government cuts in funding, the visitor centre closed in 2010, but conservation work continues in the building.\n\nThe centre is constructed in red brick on a rusticated stone plinth, with stone dressings and bands, and some decoration in blue brick. The exterior of the building is expressed as three or four storeys, and around the top of the building is a cornice with modillions. The hipped roof is in slate. On each of the four sides are arched openings large enough to admit freight. The front on Crosshall Street is concave; it is in eight bays, each bay consisting of a tall blind arch containing windows, two of which also have arched entrances. On the Victoria Street front are carved spandrels containing shields and the names of stations of the Midland Railway. In 1921 Charles Reilly, Professor of Architecture at the University of Liverpool, was of the opinion that at the time it was \"one of the best buildings in the town\". On 14 March 1975, it was designated as a Grade II listed building.\n\n"}

{"id": "24520356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24520356", "title": "Officer and Laughing Girl", "text": "Officer and Laughing Girl\n\nOfficer and Laughing Girl, also known as Officer and a Laughing Girl, Officer With a Laughing Girl or De Soldaat en het Lachende Meisje, was painted by the Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer between 1655 and 1660. It was painted in oil on canvas, typical of most Dutch artists of the time, and is 50.5 by 46 cm. It now resides in The Frick Collection in New York.\n\n\"Officer and Laughing Girl\" includes many of the characteristics of Vermeer's style. The main subject is a woman in a yellow dress, light is coming from the left-hand side of the painting from an open window, and there is a large map on the wall. Each of these elements occur in some of his other paintings, although this painting differs slightly with the man also sitting at the table. Art historians, who have suggested conflicting interpretations of the work, believe that a painting by Gerard van Honthorst inspired the composition and that Vermeer used a camera obscura to create the perspective in this painting.\n\nThe main subject is the woman, and soft, direct light falls on her face. She resembles Vermeer's wife, Catharina Bolnes, who is believed to have posed for many of his paintings. With x-ray photographs, art historians can see that Vermeer had planned to paint the woman with a large white collar which would have hidden much of her yellow dress. Also, her cap was later extended to cover all of her hair, in order to draw attention to her face and expression. This yellow bodice with braiding has appeared in many of Vermeer's other portraits. It is called a schort and was usually worn as an everyday, common dress. The woman is also wearing a blue apron over her dress, but it is hidden in the shadows caused by the table. Blue aprons were common attire at that time because they hid stains well. Art historians have interpreted this to mean that the soldier surprised the girl with an impromptu visit during her morning chores. The woman is holding a wine glass, usually used for white wine. Because at that time, wine cost more than beer, it illustrates her wealth.\n\nThe man in the painting is a cavalier wearing a red coat and an expensive hat, showing his wealth and rank. His hat is wide- brimmed and made of beaver pelt, which was weather resistant and good for snowy and rainy conditions. The pelts for these hats were imported from the New World. This hat was probably from New Netherlands, which was then under the Dutch West India Company's control. The red in his uniform is associated with power and passion, bringing a passionate and emotional mood to the painting. His rank as an officer is identified by the black sash he wears. However, his presence in the immediate foreground is what the viewers notice first. His striking presence adds drama and mystery to the mood of the composition. This artistic device—in which an object is placed in the foreground to increase the depth of field of the overall painting—is called repoussoir. Caravaggio often used this technique and Vermeer probably learned it from a Caravaggist's painting.\n\nThe meaning of the interaction between the woman and the soldier is unknown. Many art historians believe that it only portrays a woman being innocently and honorably courted by this soldier. However, some have argued that her open hand and smile could be asking for payment before coitus.\n\n\"The Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer of Delft (1632-1675) holds a position of great honor among map historians. Several of his painting illustrate maps hanging on walls or globes standing on tables or cabinets. Vermeer painted these cartographical documents with such detail that it is often possible to identify the actual maps. Evidently, Vermeer was particularly attached to a Willem Blaeu - Balthasar Florisz van Berckenrode map of Holland and West Friesland, as he represented it as a wall decoration in three of his paintings... Though no longer extant, the map's existence is known from archival sources and second edition published by Willem Blaeu in 1621, titled \"Nova et Accurata Totius Hollandiae Westfriesiaeq. Topographia, Descriptore Balthazaro Florentio a Berke[n]rode Batavo\". Vermeer must have had a copy at his disposal (or the earlier one published by Van Berckenrode). Around 1658 he showed it as a wall decoration in his painting \"Officer and Laughing Girl\", which depicts a soldier in a large hat sitting with his back to viewer, talking with a smiling girl who holds a glass in her hand. Bright sunlight bathes the girl and the large map on the wall. Vermeer's gift for realism is evidenced by the fact that the wall map, mounted on linen and wooden rods, is identifiable as Blaeu's 1621 map of Holland and West Friesland. He captures all of its characteristic design, decoration, and geographic content.\"\n\nThe window and lighting is characteristic of Vermeer's interior paintings, most likely because it is modeled after the room he painted in. This window is extremely similar to the window in the \"Girl Reading a Letter\" and \"Open Window and the Milkmaid\". The glass in the window has many variations of color, showing Vermeer's precision in the details of this painting. Only bright light comes in from the window and no outside scene can be observed, as Vermeer never allows the viewer to see the outside world.\n\nArt historians believe that Vermeer used a device called a camera obscura to help him create the perspective in his painting. Instead of using a mathematical formula or a vanishing point, Vermeer probably used this mechanical device to show him what the relative size of the people should be. A camera obscura is similar to a camera as it projects an image seen through the aperture into a dark chamber. There is no historical evidence that Vermeer used such a device but the way he portrays perspective in many of his paintings, including \"Officer and Laughing Girl\", suggests that he did.\n\nThe older pigment analysis by W. Kuhn and also the more recent data collection revealed the use of the typical pigments of the Baroque period: ochres, lead-tin-yellow, natural ultramarine, and azurite.\n\n\n\n"}

It was established in 1884 and rebuilt in 1937, and extensively refurbished in 2004 by Sir Cameron Mackintosh, its current owner. The theatre should not be confused with the former Scala Theatre in London that was known as the \"Prince of Wales Royal Theatre\" or \"Prince of Wales's Theatre\" from 1865 until its demolition in 1903.\n\nThe first theatre on the site opened in January 1884 when C.J. Phipps built the Prince's Theatre for actor-manager Edgar Bruce. It was a traditional three-tier theatre, seating just over 1,000 people. The theatre was renamed the \"Prince of Wales Theatre\" in 1886 after the future Edward VII. Located between Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square, the theatre was favourably situated to attract theatregoers.\n\nThe first production in the theatre was an 1884 revival of W. S. Gilbert's \"The Palace of Truth\" starring Herbert Beerbohm Tree, preceded by a one-act comedy, \"In Honour Bound\". This was soon followed by a free adaptation of Ibsen's \"A Doll's House\", called \"Breaking a Butterfly\". In 1885, Lillie Langtry, reputedly the first \"society\" lady to become an actress, played in \"Princess George\" and \"The School for Scandal\". The first hit production at the theatre was the record-breaking comic opera, \"Dorothy\", starring Marie Tempest, which was so successful that its authors used the profits to build the Lyric Theatre, where it moved in 1888. The wordless mime play \"L'Enfant Prodigue\" premiered in 1891 which, together with \"A Pierrot's Life\" in 1897, brought respectability to mime troupes in Britain.\n\nGeorge Edwardes' musical play, \"In Town\", often considered the first English musical comedy, was presented at the theatre in 1892 and was followed by Edwardes' even more successful \"A Gaiety Girl\" in 1893. In 1895, Basil Hood's \"Gentleman Joe, the Hansom Cabby\" began a long run starring the low comedian, Arthur Roberts, in the title role. The theatre then began to present straight plays with Maeterlinck's \"Pelléas et Mélisande\" (1898, with incidental music by Fauré) and Wills's adaptation of Dickens' \"A Tale of Two Cities\" as \"The Only Way\" (1899, also starring Harvey). Charles Hawtrey starred in the successful \"A Message from Mars\" (1901). In 1900–01, Marie Tempest played the title roles in the play \"English Nell\" (based on Simon Dale's novel about Nell Gwynn), \"Peg Woffington\", a dramatisation of Charles Reade's novel, as well as Becky Sharp in a dramatisation of Thackeray's \"Vanity Fair\".\nThe theatre played more musical comedies beginning in 1903, including the Frank Curzon and Isabel Jay hits \"Miss Hook of Holland\" (1907, its matinee version, \"Little Miss Hook of Holland\" was performed by children for children), \"King of Cadonia\" (1908), and \"The Balkan Princess\" (1910), and later the World War I hits, \"Broadway Jones\" (1914), \"Carminetta\" (1917), and \"Yes, Uncle!\" (1917).\n\nThe theatre then hosted plays such as Avery Hopwood's farce \"Fair and Warmer\" (1918) and Ivor Novello's \"The Rat\" (1924, Novello's first play, in which he also starred), and revues including \"A to Z\" (1921), \"Co-Optimists\" (1923), and \"Charlot's Revue\" (1924). They starred Gertrude Lawrence, Jack Buchanan, Beatrice Lillie, Stanley Holloway, and Jessie Matthews. Ms Matthews also starred, along with Richard Hearne, in \"Wild Rose\", featuring the memorable Jerome Kern song \"Look for the Silver Lining\". These were followed by \"The Blue Train\" (1927), \"Alibi\" (1928, directed by Gerald du Maurier with Charles Laughton as Hercule Poirot), \"By Candlelight\" (1928), and \"Journey's End\" (1929). In 1930, Edith Evans became the manager at the theatre, presenting and starring in \"Delilah\", which was not a success. Beginning in 1932, the theatre presented a series of risqué \"Folies\"-style revues, including \"Voila! Les Dames\" (1935) and its last production, \"Encore les Dames\" (1937). These shows were so successful that they funded the rapid rebuilding of the theatre in 1937.\n\nAfter 50 years, the theatre's 800 seats were deemed insufficient for productions of the day, and it was demolished. On 17 June 1937, Gracie Fields sang to the workmen as she laid the foundation stone of the new Art Deco-decorated theatre, designed by Robert Cromie, and the theatre opened on 27 October that year. The new theatre's seating capacity was about 1,100, and it had a larger stage and improved facilities for both the artists and the public, including a large, stylish stalls bar (the bar itself was 14 metres long), complete with dance floor. The first productions at the new theatre were \"Les Folies de Paris et Londres\", starring George Robey, followed by \"Folies De Can-Can\" in 1938, a continuation of the old theatre's series of successful risqué revues, which ran continuously until 2 am every night. The musical comedy, \"Present Arms\", was offered in 1940, and in 1941 the theatre screened the UK premiere of Charlie Chaplin's \"The Great Dictator\". The film had been banned in many parts of Europe, and the theatre's owner, Alfred Esdaile, was fined for showing it.\n\nIn 1943, \"Strike a New Note\" was notable for Sid Field's London debut, and he returned to the theatre in \"Strike it Again\" (1944), and yet again in \"Piccadilly Hayride\" (1946, a revue that ran for 778 performances). In 1949, \"Harvey\", Mary Coyle Chase's comedy about an imaginary rabbit, was a success, as was \"Diamond Lil\" in 1948 starring Mae West. In the 1950s, the theatre hosted variety and revues, starring such famous performers as Norman Wisdom, Peter Sellers, Bob Hope, Gracie Fields, Benny Hill, Hughie Green, Frankie Howerd, and Morecambe and Wise. In 1959, Paul Osborn's \"The World of Susie Wong\" became the theatre's longest-running play to date with 832 performances. On 4 November 1963, The Beatles performed From Me to You, She Loves You, Till There Was You, and Twist and Shout at the Prince of Wales Theatre, during the Royal Variety Show in the presence of The Queen Mother.\n\nNeil Simon's play, \"Come Blow Your Horn\", starring Michael Crawford, played in 1962, followed by a season of Martha Graham's dance company, including the world première of her ballet \"Circe\". Next was a string of Broadway musicals, including \"Funny Girl\" in 1966 with Barbra Streisand, \"Sweet Charity\" (1967), and \"Promises, Promises\" (1969). \"The Threepenny Opera\" was revived in 1972. In 1976, Bernard Slade's \"Same Time, Next Year\" was a hit, as was \"I Love My Wife\" (1977), and \"Bedroom Farce\" (1978). In 1982, \"Underneath the Arches\" was a long-running hit. Andrew Lloyd Webber's \"Aspects of Love\" (1989) smashed all previous box-office records at the theatre, running for 1,325 performances. More recent productions are listed below.\n\nRefurbishment was carried out in 2004 to increase the seating capacity slightly to 1,160 seats and to modernise the theatre's facilities. New bars were added, the auditorium completely rebuilt, the backstage areas refurbished and the theatre's famous tower and exterior completely gutted and refurbished with new LED lighting and a crisp modern finish.\n\nThe theatre re-opened with ABBA's musical \"Mamma Mia!\" on 16 April 2004. On 18 August 2007, \"Mamma Mia!\" became the longest-running show ever at the Prince of Wales, overtaking the previous record held by \"Aspects of Love\" with 1,326 performances at the venue and counting. The production marked another landmark on Thursday 23 August 2007, celebrating its 3,500th performance since its 1999 world premiere at the Prince Edward Theatre in Old Compton Street, London. The production left the theatre on 1 September 2012 and transferred to the Novello Theatre on 6 September 2012.\n\nThe theatre was grade II listed by English Heritage in April 1999.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Played by Lisa Lewis, the character appeared for a period of six years between 1983 and 1989. Shirley became the programme's first regular black character.\n\nShirley Armitage was a machinist at Baldwin's Casuals. From 1988 to 1989, she lived with Curly Watts in the shop flat but left the area when they split up.\n\nShirley Armitage started work at denim factory Baldwin's Casuals in September 1983. Shirley came from a big family, with nine living in the same house. At the factory, Shirley was one of the youngest machinists and usually stayed quiet while the louder personalities, chiefly Vera Duckworth (Liz Dawn) and Ida Clough (Helene Palmer), led the gossip. She occasionally spoke up to back the girls against Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs), for example when she favoured a strike when Mike announced that some of the staffs' jobs would be at risk because of a new computer system at the factory in July 1984.\n\nIn 1985, Shirley chatted to Curly Watts (Kevin Kennedy) at a dance at the Community Centre and let him walk her home afterwards. Curly was shy about asking her out but they hit it off and Curly later chatted her up at Kevin (Michael Le Vell) and Sally Webster's (Sally Dynevor) flatwarming party in August 1987. They started seeing each other on a casual basis after that. By 1986, Shirley was getting sick of living in such a crowded home and decided to ask Alf Roberts (Bryan Mosley) if she could rent the shop flat as the Websters had moved into No.13. Alf asked for a reference but in the time it took her to get one from Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire), Curly also made enquiries about the flat and Alf agreed he could move in. When Shirley and Curly compared notes, they were puzzled as Curly hadn't been asked for a reference. Thinking Alf racist, Curly decided to refuse the flat but Shirley suggested they move in together. Curly agreed and Alf backed down when Emily threatened to tell people about his racism. The unexpected move marked a big change in Shirley's and Curly's lives, as well as their relationship, with Shirley becoming the first woman Curly had ever slept with. Their next obstacle was winning over each other's families, no easy task as despite the race issue, Shirley's parents disapproved of her living in sin. Eventually, Mrs Armitage was convinced that Curly loved Shirley but his parents never accepted Shirley. Mrs Armitage was accepting enough to let Shirley's younger sister, Lucy, stay with the couple for a few weeks in August.\n\nLater that year, Curly enrolled in a business studies course at college. Shirley wasn't convinced it would be a good move as that would make Shirley the sole earner while he studied but she admired his ability and caused a stir at work by showing them Curly's essay on Mike making the machinists work in terrible Victorian conditions. Mike insisted Curly give it to him, threatening to sack Shirley otherwise. Curly's new career was to split the couple up. In April 1989, Shirley threw a surprise party to celebrate their first anniversary but Curly promptly threw everyone out as he had an important exam the next day. Shirley realised that Curly was too serious for her and decided to move back in with her parents. Desperate to stop Shirley leaving, Curly broke down and proposed marriage, promising to change, but Shirley knew that the relationship had run its course and left.\n\nShirley left Baldwin's Casuals, a week after splitting up with Curly and moved to Gorton.\n"}

It was sometimes referred to as the Nobile Associazione. After the original theatre burned down in 1806, construction began on the present theatre soon after. The current theatre was designed by Luigi Canonica and it opened in 1808 under the name the Teatro della Concordia. Its name was changed again to the Teatro Ponchielli in 1907 after the famous native of Cremona, Amilcare Ponchielli. \n\nIn 1986 the theatre was purchased by the city of Cremona which renamed it once again as it is known today. The opening performance took place on 4 October and featured performances on the city-owned Stradivarius \"Il Cremonese\" and Guarneri \"del Gesu\" violins of 1715 and 1734 respectively.\n\nWith its original horseshoe-shaped auditorium, the theatre was remodeled in 1989 to create three box tiers and two galleries with a total of 1,249 seats.\n\n\nLynn, Karyl Charna, \"Italian Opera Houses & Festivals\", Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2005 \n\n"}
{"id": "20553720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20553720", "title": "Texture (visual arts)", "text": "Texture (visual arts)\n\nIn the visual arts, texture is the perceived surface quality of a work of art. It is an element of two-dimensional and three-dimensional designs and is distinguished by its perceived visual and physical properties. Use of \"texture\", along with other elements of design, can convey a variety of messages and emotions.\n\nThe physical texture (also known as \"actual texture\" or \"tactile texture\") are the patterns of variations upon a solid surface. This can include -but is not limited to- fur, wood grain, sand, smooth surface of canvas or metal, glass, and leather. \n\nPhysical texture differentiates itself from visual texture by having a \"physical quality\" that can be felt by touching the surface of the texture. Specific use of a texture can affect the smoothness that an artwork conveys. For instance, use of \"rough surfaces\" can be visually active, whilst \"smooth surfaces\" can be visually restful. The use of both can give a sense of personality to a design, or utilized to create emphasis, rhythm, contrast, etc.\n\nLight is an important factor for identifying the physical texture because it can affect how a surface is being viewed. Strong lights on a smooth surface can obscure the readability of a drawing or photograph, whilst they can create strong contrasts in a highly textural surface such as river rocks, sand, etc.\n\nVisual texture or implied texture is the illusion of having physical texture. Every material and every support surface has its own visual texture and needs to be taken into consideration before creating a composition. As such, materials such as canvas and watercolour paper are considerably rougher than, for example, photo-quality computer paper and may not be best suited to creating a flat, smooth texture. Photography, drawings and paintings use visual texture both to portray their own subject matter realistically and with interpretation. Texture in these media is generally created by the repetition of the shape and line.\n\nDecorative texture \"decorates a surface\". Texture is added to embellish the surface either that usually contains some uniformity. \n\nThis focuses more on the process of the visual creation; the marks of texture made also creates the shapes. These are often \"accidental\" forms that create texture.\n\nTexture created by special mechanical means. An example of this would be photography; the grains and/or screen pattern that is often found in printing creates texture on the surface. This is also exemplified by designs in typography and computer graphics. \n\nHypertexture can be defined as both the \"realistic simulated surface texture produced by adding small distortions across the surface of an object\" (as pioneered by Ken Perlin) and as an avenue for describing the fluid morphic nature of texture in the realm of cyber graphics and the tranversally responsive works created in the field of visual arts therein (as described by Lee Klein).\n\n\n"}
