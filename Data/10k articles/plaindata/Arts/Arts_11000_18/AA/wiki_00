{"id": "46457078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46457078", "title": "Annunciation (Memling)", "text": "Annunciation (Memling)\n\nThe Annunciation is an oil-on-oak panel painting attributed to the Early Netherlandish painter Hans Memling. Completed c. 1482, it was partially transferred to canvas in the 1920s and is today held in the Robert Lehman collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The panel shows the Virgin in a domestic interior, two attendant angels, the archangel Gabriel dressed in ecclesiastical robes, and a hovering dove representing the Holy Spirit. It expands upon the Annunciation wing of Rogier van der Weyden's c. 1455 \"Saint Columba altarpiece\". According to the art historian Maryan Ainsworth, the work is a \"startlingly original image, rich in connotations for the viewer or worshiper\". \n\nThe iconography focuses on the Virgin's purity. Her swoon foreshadows the Crucifixion of Jesus, and the panel emphasises her role as mother, bride and Queen of Heaven. The original frame survived until the 19th century and was inscribed with a date believed to be 1482; modern art historians suggested the number's final digit was a nine, which would give a date of 1489. In 1847 Gustav Friedrich Waagen described it as one of Memling's \"finest and most original works\". In 1902 it was exhibited in Bruges at the \"Exposition des primitifs flamands à Bruges\", after which it underwent cleaning and restoration. Philip Lehman bought it in 1920 from the Radziwiłł family who may have had it in their family since the 16th century; Antoni Radziwiłł discovered it on a family estate in the early 19th century. At that time it had been pierced through with an arrow and required restoration.\n\nThe Annunciation was a popular theme in late medieval European art, Mary acts as Theotokos, the God-bearer as affirmed in 431 at the Council of Ephesus; two decades later the Council of Chalcedon affirmed the doctrine of Incarnation – that Christ was of two natures (God and Man) – and her perpetual virginity was affirmed at the Lateran Council of 631. In Byzantine art, Annunciation scenes depict the Virgin enthroned and dressed in royal regalia. In later centuries she was shown in enclosed spaces: the temple, the church, the garden.\n\nIn Early Netherlandish art the Annunciation is typically set in contemporary domestic interiors, a motif and tradition established by Robert Campin, and followed by Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden. Neither Campin nor van Eyck went so far as to set the scene in a bedchamber, although the motif is found in van der Weyden's c. 1435 Louvre \"Annunciation\" and c. 1455 \"Saint Columba altarpiece\" in which the Virgin kneels by the nuptial bed, rendered in red made from costly pigments. Memling's depiction is nearly identical to van der Weyden's \"Columba Altarpiece\".\n\nThe archangel Gabriel appears before Mary to announce that she will bear the Son of God. He is shown standing in a three-quarter view wearing a small jeweled diadem and dressed in vestments. He has a richly embroidered red-and-gold brocade cope, edged with a pattern of gray seraphim and wheels, over a white alb and amice. He holds his staff of office in one hand, and raises the other towards the Virgin. He bends his knees, honoring and acknowledging her as Mother of Christ and Queen of Heaven, and his feet are bare and positioned slightly behind hers.\n\nThe Virgin is in a frontal view; directly behind her the red-curtained bed acts as a framing device, similar to the traditional canopy-of-honor or baldachin. Unlike Memling's predecessors whose Virgins are garbed in heavily jeweled and costly robes, the plain white shift she wears beneath a blue mantle is minimally jeweled at the hem and at the open neckline. A purple underdress peeks out at her neck and wrists, indicating her royal status. Mary seems neither surprised nor fearful at the announcement; according to Blum the scene is rendered with a great sense of naturalism and successfully depicts \"the transformation of Mary from girl to God-bearer.\" \n\nThe Virgin holds an innovative and unusual position. She seems to be either rising or swooning as if having lost her balance, a divergence from her conventional seated or kneeling pose. Blum believes \"one may search in vain in other Netherlandish Annunciation panels of the fifteenth century of a Virgin positioned as she is here\". Art historian Penny Jolly suggests the painting shows a birthing position, a motif van der Weyden experimented with in the \"Seven Sacraments Altarpiece\", where the Virgin's collapse results in a childbirth-like posture, and with the \"Descent from the Cross\", in which Mary Magdalen bends and crouches – similar to the position Memling's Magdalen assumes in his \"\". Flanking the Virgin, and holding her, are two attendant angels. The one to the left lifts the Virgin's robe while the other gazes at the viewer, \"soliciting our response\", according to Ainsworth. Both are small-statured, solemn, and according to Blum, in mood \"comparable to that of Gabriel.\" Other than the presence of the angels, Memling shows a typical upper-merchant-class 15th-century Flemish bedchamber.\n\nThe dove of the Holy Spirit hovers inside a rainbow-hued circle of light directly above the Virgin's head. Its placement and size is unusual for art of the period. It is unlike anything found in van der Weyden, and never repeated in Memling's work, but reminiscent of van Eyck's dove in the \"Ghent Altarpiece's\" Annunciation panel. Its shape is found in medallions hung above beds at that time, and thus seems in keeping with the domestic interior.\n\nMary's left hand rests on an open prayer-book, which she has propped open on a \"prie-dieu\", with the letter \"D\" visible – perhaps for \"Deus tecum\" (\"the Lord be with you\"), according to Ainsworth. Blum speculates the passage is from Isaiah 7:14, \"Behold a Virgin shall conceive and bear a son.\" A vase containing white lilies and a single blue iris is next to it on the floor.\n\nA curtain sack, commonly found on beds of the period, hangs in the central axis between Gabriel and the attendant angel. A sideboard beside the bed contains two types of candles and a flask of water standing in bright light falling from the window to the left. The floor is multi-colored tile-work, similar to van der Weyden's \"Columba altarpiece\"; Memling truncates the ceiling rafters in the mid-ground, at the end of the bed, with the floor extending into the foreground. Blum describes the effect as acting \"like an open stage for the holy figures\".\n\nThe iconography is not overly labored, and Memling avoids extraneous symbolism. Many elements emphasize Mary's role as the Mother of God; the chamber is furnished with simple everyday objects that indicate her purity. The vase of lilies and the items on the sideboard are objects 15th-century viewers would have associated with her. White lilies were often used to signify her purity, while irises or sword lilies were used as metaphors for her suffering. Memling emphasizes symbols associated with her womb and virginity, and \"introduces two additional angelic priests, and floods the room with natural light, thereby rearranging the anecdotal to emphasize the doctrinal meaning.\" Charles Sterling describes the work as \"one of the finest examples of Memling's ability to take a pictorial convention inherited from his predecessors and infuse it with a heightened sense of emotion and narrative complexity.\"\n\nFrom the 9th century Light became associated with Mary and the Incarnation. Millard Meiss notes that, from the 12th century a common way to convey the conception was to compare light passing through glass to the passage of the Holy Spirit through the body of the Virgin. St. Bernard likened it to sunshine explaining in this passage: \"Just as the brilliance of the sun fills and penetrates a glass window without damaging it, and pierces its solid form with imperceptible subtlety, neither hurting when entering nor destroying when emerging; thus the word of God, the splendor of the Father, entered the virgin chamber and then came forth from the closed womb.\" \n\nThree objects on the bedside cabinet represent the Virgin's purity: the water flask, the candleholder, and the ropewick light. The light passing through the glass of the womb-shaped flask symbolizes her flesh, pierced by divine light, its clear and undisturbed water represents her purity at the moment of conception, a device found also in the earlier paintings as a metaphor of the Virgin's sanctity. The flask shows a reflection of the window's crossbar as a cross, a symbol of the Crucifixion, another small detail in which Memling \"lays one translucent symbolic form upon another\".\n\nLight represented by candles was then often used to symbolise the Virgin and Christ; both Campin and van Eyck placed hearths or candles in their annunciation scenes. The candleholder without a candle and the ropewick without flame symbolize the world before Christ's Nativity and the presence of his divine light, according to Ainsworth.\n\nThe challenge for painters of the Annunciation was how to visually represent the Incarnation, the Word made flesh, or \"Logos\". They often showed rays of light emanating from Gabriel or a nearby window entering Mary's body to depict the concept of Christ \"who inhabited and passed through her body\". The light rays might sometimes include an inscription, and were sometimes shown entering her ear, in the belief that it was thus the Word became flesh. \n\nMemling did not depict the light as distinct rays, nor had Dieric Bouts's Getty \"Annunciation\". Yet the room is bright, filled with sunlight, a \"fenestra incarnationis\", which would have been an adequate symbol for the contemporary viewer. By the mid-15th century the Virgin is found depicted in a room or chamber near an open window to permit the passage of light. Memling's room, with its window through which light streams, is a most \"decorous sign of Mary's chastity\", according to Blum. There are no word scrolls or banderoles to indicate the Virgin's acceptance, yet her consent is obvious through her pose, which seems, according to Sterling, both submissive and active.\n\nThe Virgin birth is indicated by the red bed and red womb-shaped curtain-sack. During the early-15th century hanging beds or curtain-sacks became symbols of the Incarnation, and \"served to affirm [Christ's] humanity\". Blum notes that at a time \"when artists did not hesitate to depict the breast of the Virgin, Memling did not shun her womb\". Christ's humanity was a source of fascination, and it was only in Netherlandish art that a solution was found for visualizing his embryonic state with curtain-sacks draped to suggest the shape of a womb. \n\nMary's body becomes the tabernacle holding the Host made flesh. She becomes an object of devotion, a \"monstrance containing the Host\". Her full belly and the presence of the dove indicate the moment of Incarnation has occurred. Viewers would have been reminded of the Crucifixion and Lamentation with the swoon, \"thus anticipating Christ's sacrifice for the salvation of mankind at the moment of his conception.\" According to theologians, Mary stood with dignity at the Crucifixion of Jesus, but in 15th-century art she is depicted swooning, according to Jolly, \"in agony at the sight of her dying son … assuming the pose of a mother in the throes of the pain of childbirth\". At the cross she felt the pain of his death; pain which at his birth she had not experienced.\n\nThe painting's domestic setting belies its liturgical meaning. The dove is a reminder of the Eucharist and Mass. Lotte Brand Philip observes how throughout the 15th century \"eucharistic vessels made in the form of doves and suspended over altars … were lowered at the moment of transubstantiation\"; here it suggests that in the same way the Holy Spirit gives life to the bread and wine, it gave life to the Virgin's womb. She carries the Body and Blood of Christ, and is attended by three priestly angels. Mary's function is to bear \"the Savior of the World\"; the angels' role is to \"support, present and protect her sacred being\". With the birth of Christ her \"miraculous womb passed its final test\" to become an object of veneration.\n\nMemling presents the Virgin as the Bride of Christ about to assume her role as Queen of Heaven, with attendant angels indicating her royal status. These kind of angels are usually shown hovering above the Virgin, holding her crown, and some German painters showed them hovering close in Annunciation scenes, but angels rarely approach or touch the Virgin. Only a single previous version of such attendant angels has been found: in the Boucicaut Master's early 15th-century illuminated manuscript version of the \"Visitation\", the pregnant Virgin's long mantle is held by attendant angels, about which Blum notes that \"her queenly appearance surely commemorates the moment when Mary is first addressed as Theotokos, the Mother of the Lord.\" Memling often depicted pairs of angels dressed in vestments attending the Virgin, but these two, dressed in simple amices and albs, were never repeated in his art. Their dual function is to \"present the eucharistic offering and proclaim the Virgin bride and queen\".\n\nThe \"Annunciation\" draws heavily on van der Weyden's 1430s Louvre \"Annunciation\", his c. 1455 \"Saint Columba altarpiece\", and the \"Clugny Annunciation\" (c. 1465–75), which is attributed to either van der Weyden or Memling. Memling almost certainly was apprenticed to van der Weyden in Brussels until setting up his own workshop in Bruges sometime after 1465. Memling's \"Annunciation\" is more innovative, with motifs such as the attendant angels that were absent in the earlier paintings. According to Till-Holger Borchert, not only was Memling familiar with van der Weyden's motifs and compositions, but he might have assisted with the underdrawing in van der Weyden's workshop. The shutters on the right are copied from the Louvre panel, the knotted curtain appears in the \"Columba\" triptych's \"Annunciation\". \n\nA sense of movement is conveyed throughout. The trailing edges of Gabriel's garment fall outside the pictorial space, indicating his arrival. The Virgin's \"serpentine\" pose, with attendant angels supporting her, adds to the sense of flow. Memling's use of color achieves a startling effect. The traditional rays of light are replaced with light color indicators; the white clothes rendered in \"icy\" blue, the angel to the right in yellow patches seems \"bleached by light\", the left-hand angel appears to be steeped in shadow, dressed in clothes of lavender and bearing deep green wings. The effect is iridescent, according to Blum, who writes, \"this shimmering surface gives [the figures] an unearthly quality, separating them from the more believable world of the bedchamber.\" The effect deviates from the pure naturalism and realism which typifies Early Netherlandish art, causing a \"startling\" juxtaposition, an effect that is \"unsteadying\" and contradictory.\n\nScholars have not established if the panel was meant to be a single devotional work, or part of a larger, and now broken up, polyptych. According to Ainsworth, its size and \"the sacramental nature of its subject would have been appropriate for a family chapel in a church or monastery for the chapel of a guild corporation.\" An intact, inscribed frame is unusual for a wing panel, indicating that it was probably intended as a single piece, but scholars are unsure because the slight left-to-right axis of the tiles tend to suggest it could have been the left-hand wing of a larger piece. There is no information about the panel's reverse, which has not survived.\n\nTechnical analysis shows extensive underdrawing, typical for Memling. They were completed in a dry medium except for the dove and the flask and candles on the sideboard. Revisions during the final painting included the enlargement of the Virgin's sleeves and the repositioning of Gabriel's staff. Incisions were made to indicate the floor tiles and the dove's position.\n\nThe only person to question Gustav Friedrich Waagen's 1847 attribution to Memling is W. H. J. Weale, who in 1903 declared Memling \"would never have dreamt of introducing into the representation of this mystery these two sentimental and affected angels.\"\n\nThe painting's known provenance begins in the 1830s when it was in the possession of the Radziwiłł family. According to art historian Sulpiz Boisserée, who saw the painting in 1832, Antoni Radziwiłł found the painting in an estate his father owned. Waagen speculated that may have belonged to Mikolai Radziwill (1549–1616) who might have inherited it from his brother Jerzy Radziwill, (1556–1600), who was a cardinal. The family kept it until 1920 when Princess Radziwill sold it to the Duveen Brothers in Paris. Philip Lehman bought it in October 1920; it is now held in the Robert Lehman collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York.\n\nGenerally the condition is good. Memling painted the work on two panels of about 28 cm each. The dated and inscribed frame, probably the original, was discarded in 1830. There have been three documented restorations. The painting had been pierced by an arrow when Anton Radziwill found it; he had it restored and the damage repaired. At that time the Virgin's mantle and the flesh tones sustained heavy overpainting. The original frame was discarded, but its inscription was inserted into the new frame. A description of the original frame suggests it carried a coat-of-arms, perhaps belonging to Jerzy Radziwill. The second restoration was after its exhibition in Bruges in 1902; and the third when Lehman had it restored and transferred to canvas sometime after 1928. The painting survived the transfer without significant damage. A late-19th century photograph shows wood on all four sides of the painted surface, which suggests the edges may have been extended during the transfer. Areas that suffered paint loss and overpainting are Gabriel's cope and the vase holding the flowers.\n\nWhen Boisserée saw the painting he recorded the inscription's date as 1480. The last digit of the inscription was faded and difficult to read and had become illegible by 1899. Waagen suggested the date could have been 1482, and art historian Dirk de Vos suggested 1489.\nMemling's style does not lend itself well to assigning dates, making a determination difficult. According to Stirling, an earlier date is easily accepted, especially because of stylistic similarities to Memling's 1479 \"St John Altarpiece\", whereas Ainsworth leans toward the later date as more in keeping with the mature style of the late 1480s.\n\n"}

His debut film, Raja Harishchandra, which was the first Marathi cinema, was the first Indian movie in 1913, and is now known as India's first full-length feature. He made 95 feature-length films and 27 short films in his career, spanning 19 years, until 1937, including his most noted works: \"Mohini Bhasmasur\" (1913), \"Satyavan Savitri\" (1914), \"Lanka Dahan\" (1917), \"Shri Krishna Janma\" (1918) and \"Kaliya Mardan\" (1919).\nThe Dadasaheb Phalke Award, for lifetime contribution to cinema, was instituted in his honour by the Government of India in 1969. The award is one of the most prestigious awards in Indian cinema and is the highest official recognition for film personalities in our country. A postage stamp bearing his likeness was released by India Post to honour him in 1971. An honorary award from the \"Dadasaheb Phalke Academy Mumbai\" was introduced in the year 2001, for lifetime achievement in Indian cinema.\n\nDhundiraj Phalke was born on 30 April 1870 at Trimbak, Maharashtra (then Bombay Presidency) into a Marathi-speaking Chitpavan Brahmin family. His father, Govind Sadashiv alias Dajishastri, was a Sanskrit scholar and worked as a priest conducting religious ceremonies and his mother, Dwarkabai, was a housewife. The couple had seven children, three sons and four daughters. Shivrampant, the eldest, was twelve years elder than Phalke and worked in Baroda. He briefly worked as the \"Dewan\" (Chief Administrator) of the princely state of Jawhar and died in 1921, at the age of 63. Phalke's second brother, Raghunathrao, also worked as priest and died at a young age of 21. Dajishastri taught Phalke to conduct religious rituals like yajna and dispensing of medicines. When he was appointed as a professor of Sanskrit in the Wilson College, Mumbai, the family shifted its base to Mumbai (then Bombay). Phalke completed his primary education in Trimbakeshwar and matriculation was done in Mumbai.\n\nPhalke joined the Sir J. J. School of Art, Mumbai in 1885 and completed a one-year course in drawing. At the beginning of 1886, he accompanied his elder brother, Shivrampant, to Baroda where he got married to a girl from Marathe family. Later, he joined Faculty of Fine Arts at the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda and completed a course in Oil painting and Watercolor painting in 1890. He also achieved proficiency in architecture and modelling. In the same year, Phalke bought a film camera and started experimenting with photography, processing, and printing. He was awarded a gold medal for creating a model of an ideal theatre at the 1892 Industrial Exhibition of Ahmedabad. While his work was much appreciated, one of his fans presented him a \"costly\" camera, used for still photography. In 1891, Phalke did a six-months course to learn the techniques of preparing half-tone blocks, photo-lithio, and three-colour ceramic photography. Principal Gajjar of Kala Bhavan sent Phalke to Ratlam to learn three-colour blockmaking, photolitho transfers, colotype and darkroom printing techniques under the guidance of Babulal Varuvalkar.\n\nIn 1893, Gajjar allowed Phalke to use the photo studio and laboratory of Kala Bhavan where he started his work under the name of \"Shri Phalke's Engraving and Photo Printing\". Despite his proficiency in various skills, he did not have a stable family life and had difficulties in making a living. Thus, in 1895, he decided to become a professional photographer and relocated to Godhra for doing business. His business did not do well in Godhra and he lost his wife and a child in the 1900 plague epidemic in the city. Phalke returned to Baroda and started photography business. It did not run well because of the myth spread across the city that the camera sucks up the energy from a person's body which leads to their death. He faced similar resistance from the Prince of Baroda who refused to take photographs with the assumptions that it would shorten his life. Though, the Prince was later convinced by Phalke who went on to advocate the benefits of photography in his court, it did not help Phalke's business. He started the business of painting the stage curtains for the drama companies. This got him some basic training in drama production and fetched him a few minor roles in the plays.\n\nPhalke learned magic tricks from a German magician who was on a tour in Baroda that time. This helped him use trick photography in his filmmaking. At the end of 1901, Phalke began to hold the public performances of magic using professional name of Professor Kelpha with letters of his last name in reverse order. In 1902, Phalke remarried to Saraswati Karandikar, niece of proprietor of Kirloskar Natak Mandali. In 1903, he got a job as a photographer and draftsman at the Archaeological Survey of India. However, not satisfied with the job, Phalke resigned in 1906 and set up a printing press at Lonavla under the name of \"Phalke Engraving and Printing Works\" with R. G. Bhandarkar as a partner.\n\nThe press majorly worked for making photo-litho transfers for Ravi Verma Press, owned by painter Raja Ravi Varma. Later, it also started the work of halftone blockmaking and printing and tri-colour printing. With the growing business, the press was shifted to Dadar, Mumbai. Later in 1908, Purushottam Mavji replaced Bhandarkar as a partner and the press was renamed as \"Laxmi Art Printing Works\". Phalke went to Germany in 1909 to buy the necessary colour printing machinery. Though the printing business grew exponentially, the partners had increasing differences about the running of the press. Soon, Phalke decided to abandon the partnership, without availing any monetary benefits.\n\nAfter quitting \"Laxmi Art Printing Works\", Phalke received multiple offers from various financiers to start another printing press but he did not accept any offers. On 14 April 1911, Phalke with his elder son Bhalchandra went to see a film, \"Amazing Animals\", at the America India Picture Palace, Girgaon, Mumbai. Surprised at seeing animals on the screen, Bhalchandra informed his mother, Saraswatibai, about his experience earlier that day. None of the family members believed them, so Phalke took his family to see the film the next day. As it was Easter, the theatre screened a film about Jesus, \"The Life of Christ\" (1906) by the French director Alice Guy-Blaché instead. While watching Jesus on the screen, Phalke envisioned Hindu deities Rama and Krishna instead and decided to start in the business of \"moving pictures\".\n\nFor the next one year, Phalke started collecting various film related material like catalogues, books, and movie making equipment from Europe. He bought a small film camera and reels and started showing movies at night, by focusing candle light on a lens and projecting the pictures on the wall. He watched movies every evening for four to five hours and was deprived of sleep. This put strain on his eyes and he developed cataract in both eyes. He continued working against the advice of taking rest and lost his sight completely. Ophthalmologist Dr. Prabhakar treated Phalke with the aid of three or four pairs of spectacles which helped him restore the eye sight. Phalke wished to go to London to get technical knowledge of filmmaking but had difficulties getting finances for his trip. With the help of Yashwantrao Nadkarni and Abasaheb Chitnis, he secured a sum of ten thousands by mortgaging his insurance policies worth twelve thousands. On 1 February 1912, he boarded a ship for London.\n\nAt London, Phalke saw a nameboard of \"Bioscope Cine-Weekly\" near Piccadilly Circus. He was a subscriber of the weekly in India. He met its editor, Mr. Kepburn, and explained the purpose of his visit. Kepburn advised Phalke against the idea of filmmaking in India based on the unsuccessful attempts in England and suggested that the Indian climate might not be suitable as well. However, he was impressed with Phalke's dedication and introduced him to the film director, producer, and screenwriter Cecil Hepworth of Walton Studios. Hepworth allowed Phalke to visit all the departments of the studio and their workings along with the demonstration of filming. At the advice of Kepburn and Hepworth, he bought Williamson camera for fifty pounds and placed an order for Kodak raw film and a perforator. Phalke stayed in London for two weeks and returned to India on 1 April 1912. He founded \"Phalke Films\" on the same day.\n\nAfter coming back from London, Phalke started looking for a spacious place for shooting the films. Soon, the family shifted from Ismail Building, Charni Road to Mathura Bhavan Bungalow, Dadar. He constructed a small glass room at the compound of the bungalow and prepared a dark room and arrangements for processing the film. Imported filmmaking equipment reached Mumbai in May 1912 and Phalke set it up within four days with the help of sketch provided. He also taught his family to perforate and develop the film. To test the working of camera and projector, Phalke filmed the boys and girls in the surroundings to the satisfactory results. To demonstrate the filmmaking techniques and get financier for the feature film, Phalke decided to make a short film. He planted some peas in a pot and placed a camera in front of it. He shot one frame a day for over a month producing a film just over one minute, of the seed growing, sprouting, and changing into a climber. The short film titled \"Ankurachi Wadh\" (\"Growth of a Pea Plant\") and was showed selective individuals. Some of them, including Yashwantrao Nadkarni and Narayanrao Devhare, offered Phalke a loan.\n\nPhalke decided to make a film based on the legends of Harishchandra and wrote the script for it. He published advertisements in various newspapers like \"Induprakash\" calling for the cast and crew required for the film. As no women were available to play female leads, male actors performed the female roles. Dattatraya Damodar Dabke played the lead role of King Harishchandra and Anna Salunke as Queen Taramati. Phalke's elder son Bhalchandra was assigned the role, Rohitashva, son of Harishchandra and Taramati. He was in-charge of the scriptment, direction, production design, make-up, editing, and film processing and Trymbak B. Telang handled the camera. The filming was completed in six months and 27 days producing a film of 3,700 feet, about four reels.\n\nThe film premiered at the Olympia Theatre, Mumbai on 21 April 1913, and had its theatrical release on Saturday, 3 May 1913 at the Coronation Cinema, Girgaon, Mumbai. It was a commercial success and laid the foundation for the film industry in the country. The film is often considered the first full-length Indian feature film with its status debated with historians considering Dadasaheb Torne's silent film \"Shree Pundalik\", released on 18 May 1912, the maiden Indian film. The Government of India recognises \"Raja Harischandra\" as the first Indian feature film.\n\nPhalke formed a film company, Hindustan Films in partnership with five businessmen from Mumbai, in the hope that by having the financial aspect of his profession handled by experts in the field, he would be free to pursue the creative aspect. He set up a model studio and trained technicians and actors but, very soon, he ran into insurmountable problems with his partners. In 1920, Phalke resigned from Hindustan Films, made his first announcement of retirement from cinema, and he wrote \"Rangbhoomi\", an acclaimed play. Without him in charge, Hindustan Films ran into deep financial losses, and he was finally persuaded to return. However, Phalke felt constrained by the business and, after directing a few films for the company, he withdrew from it.\n\nThe times changed and Phalke fell victim to the emerging technology of sound film. Unable to cope with the talkies, the man who had fathered the Indian film industry became obsolete. His last silent film \"Setubandhan\" was released in 1932 and later released with dubbing. During 1936–1938, he produced his last film \"Gangavataran\" (1937) which was the only talking movie directed by Phalke, before retiring to Nashik, where he died on 16 February 1944.\n\n\nIn 2009, the Marathi film \"Harishchandrachi Factory\", which was directed by theatre veteran Paresh Mokashi and depicts Dadasaheb Phalke's struggle in making \"Raja Harishchandra\" in 1913. It was also selected as India's official entry to the Academy Awards in the Best Foreign Language Film category.\n\nOn 30 April 2018, Google honours the Indian producer for his 148th year of his birth. The Google Doodle was featured in Canada, India, Australia and New Zealand.\n\n"}
{"id": "11472513", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11472513", "title": "Dunvegan Cup", "text": "Dunvegan Cup\n\nThe Dunvegan Cup is a wooden ceremonial cup, decorated with silver plates, which dates to 1493. It was created at the request of Caitríona, wife of John Maguire, lord of Fermanagh. The cup is an heirloom of the Macleods of Dunvegan, and is held at their seat of Dunvegan Castle. There are several traditions attributed to the cup, describing how the Macleods obtained it. However, it is thought more likely that the cup passed into the possession of the clan sometime in the 16th or 17th centuries. The Macleod chiefs have several other notable heirlooms kept at Dunvegan Castle—such as the Fairy Flag and Sir Rory Mor's Horn (\"all three pictured right\").\n\nThe Dunvegan Cup is a wooden ceremonial cup, made of wood and elaborately decorated with silver. It is square shaped at the top and rounded at the bottom, and stands on four legs. Sir Walter Scott examined the cup and, in 1815 in \"The Lord of the Isles\", gave its measurements as: in height on the outside, in depth in the inside, the extreme breadth over the mouth. In around the 1850s, Alexander Nesbitt gave similar measurements, and added that it was at the broadest point of the cup, which is somewhat below the middle.\n\nThe cup is constructed mostly of wood. Scott thought it was possibly oak, and later Nesbitt considered it to be either yew or alder. The cup is covered with mountings of silver, wrought in filigree and decorated with niello and gilding. The mouth of the cup has a rim of solid silver-gilt, in depth. On the outside of the rim is an engraved inscription in black lettering in two lines. The spaces between the letters are hatched with fine lines, which intersect diagonally. The angels of the rim have strips ornamented with niello. The inside of the rim is plain by comparison; except for the letter \"I.H.S.\" repeated on all four sides. Each side of the cup has its own designs of triangles and circles. R.C. MacLeod considered these to be representations of the Trinity and Eternity. Ian Finlay described the circled, six-pointed stars as not unlike those on the outer-side of the Domnach Airgid, which is held in the National Museum of Ireland. Empty sockets on the outside of the cup are thought to have once held stones, or glass. Several somewhat smaller sockets hold beads of coral. The silver legs are in the form of human legs; and are ornamented with a twisted wire which runs down the front. The feet have shoes, which are covered in niello, the legs being gilt. Everywhere except the rim, the silver is very thin, and in consequence has suffered a great deal of damage over the years. The cup has been classified as a \"mether\", a communal drinking cup used at ceremonial events, as it is square-shaped at the top and rounded at the bottom.\n\nAccording to F.T. MacLeod, the first published accounts of the cup were made by Sir Walter Scott, and Sir Daniel Wilson in the early 19th centuries. F.T. MacLeod noted that it is singular that three earlier visitors to Dunvegan Castle—Samuel Johnson, James Boswell, and Thomas Pennant—made no mention of having seen the cup. Scott mentioned the cup within the explanatory note on the following lines, in \"The Lord of the Isles\".\n\nScott attempted to transcribe the Latin inscription on the silver rim of the cup. His early attempt at transcribing the inscription differs significantly from later attempts by others. Scott's transcription and translation is as follows.\n\nScott's rendering of the cup's inscription made him believe that it was a Hebridean drinking cup, dating from the year 993. Scott also declared that Macleod tradition had it that the cup had once belonged to \"Neil Ghlune-Dhu, or Black-knee. But who this Neil was, no one pretends to say\". In about 1851, Sir Daniel Wilson documented the cup in his \"The Archaeology and Prehistoric Annals of Scotland\", following along the same lines as Scott. Wilson made only a few minor edits to Scott's rendering of the Latin inscription, but at the time he had not seen the cup. After certain correspondence and the aid of William Forbes Skene, Wilson was able to examine the cup in person and later amended his analysis. His subsequent rendering of the inscription was vastly different from Scott's, and Wilson concluded that the cup was a product of Irish craftsmanship, rather than of Scottish origin. Wilson's new rendering of the inscription had the cup belonging to a \"Katharina nig Ryneill\"; and he considered that the John, son of the Maguire, who was mentioned in the transcription, was the same as the one mentioned in the Annals of the Four Masters in the year 1484. Wilson stated that this John died in 1511, and that his wife was unknown; but that a Catherine, who was the daughter of MacRannal, was married to a Maguire, and her death is mentioned in the year 1490.\n\nAt about the same time, Eugene O'Curry, of the Brehon Law Commission, examined the cup and transcribed the inscription. Alexander Nesbitt noted O'Curry's transcription and pointed out that the last part of the inscription was from the fifteenth verse of the 145th Psalm. O'Curry's rendering of the woman's name was \"Katherina ingen ui Neill\"—making her an O'Neill, rather than a MacRannal. Nesbitt noted that John Maguire is recorded several times in the Annals of the Four Masters; and that he became one of the chiefs of the Maguires in 1484. Nesbitt stated that John Maguire died in 1503; and that he could not find the Katharine O'Neill, within the annals.\n\nLater, Roderick Charles MacLeod transcribed the inscription; giving the woman's name as \"Katharina Nig Ry Neil\"—Katharina, daughter of King Neil. R.C. MacLeod declared that Macleod legend assigned the cup to Niall Glúndub, and that the cup might have passed down to her from him, or that the cup was attributed to him by his descendants. R.C. MacLeod later claimed that it was traditionally given that the wooden bowl dated from the 10th century, and that it was the property of Niall Glúndub, the 10th century Irish king of Cenél nEógain, R.C. MacLeod does not rule out the possibility of the ornamentation having been added to the cup at a later date; the silver work dates, at the earliest, from the 14th century and the dated inscription puts it at 1493.\n\nIn about 1913, Fred T. MacLeod stated that he could find no reference to the cup in the Dunvegan records. He continued, that Macleod tradition was that it came into the possession of the Macleods through the fairies, of which there are one or two legends.\n\nF.T. MacLeod stated that it is impossible to determine exactly when the cup passed into the hands of the Macleods of Dunvegan. However, he thought it likely that the cup entered into the possession of the clan in the 16th or 17th centuries. During this era several Macleod chiefs took part in warring in Ireland. He considered it likely that the cup may have been a prize of war, or a gift for services. Later, R.C. MacLeod stated that a Lady O'Neill claimed in 1925 letter, that an O'Neill tradition told how the cup passed into the hands of the Macleods. The tradition runs that one of their chiefs was a close friend of a Macleod chief. When this O'Neill chief visited his friend at Dunvegan he took with him the cup and gave it to Macleod as a present.\n\nHistorically, during the 1590s, a Macleod chief lent support to certain Irish forces rebelling against those supporting Elizabeth I in Ireland. In the summer of 1594, Dòmhnall Gorm Mòr MacDhòmhnaill (chief of the Macdonalds of Sleat) and Ruairidh Mòr MacLeòid (chief of the Macleods of Harris and Dunvegan) both sailed for Ulster at the head of 500 men each. Their force was intended to support Aodh Ruadh Ó Domhnaill who was besieging Enniskillen Castle. After landing at Loch Foyle, the Hebridean chieftains were entertained by Ó Domhnaill for three days and three nights. MacDhòmhnaill then returned to the Hebrides and left his men behind in Ireland, however, MacLeòid stayed and was present at the fall of Enniskillen Castle in October 1594. He was still in Ireland the next year at the head of 600 Hebrideans, alongside Ó Domhnaill at the siege of MacCostello's Castle, in County Mayo. In light of Ruairidh Mòr's participation in activities in Ireland at the end of the 16th century, R.C. MacLeod concluded that the cup passed into the hands of the Macleods through the O'Neill chieftain Shane Ó Neill; and that the two chieftains were the friends mentioned in the traditional tale related by Lady O'Neill in 1925.\n\nIn 1927, R.C. MacLeod gave two abridged versions of traditions said to be attributed to the Dunvegan Cup, although it was R.C. MacLeod's opinion that these traditions were un-historical. The traditions are supposed to relate events which took place during the tenure of Malcolm, the third chief of Clan Macleod, who lived about 1296–1370.\n\nThe second story also mentions the two brothers, but differs in all other details. It relates how the chief held a great banquet at Rowdell in Harris.\n\n"}
{"id": "23202016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23202016", "title": "Edward Bullough", "text": "Edward Bullough\n\nEdward Bullough (28 March 1880 – 17 September 1934) was an English aesthetician and scholar of modern languages, who worked at the University of Cambridge. He did experimental work on the perception of colours, and in his theoretical work introduced the concept of psychical distance: that which \"appears to lie between our own self and its affections\" in aesthetic experience. In languages, Bullough was a dedicated teacher who published little. He came to concentrate on Italian, and was elected to the Chair of Italian at Cambridge in 1933.\n\nEdward Bullough was born in Thun, Switzerland, on 28 March 1880, to John Bullough and Bertha Schmidlein. As a child he lived mostly in Germany, and was educated at Vitzthum Gymnasium, Dresden. At seventeen Bullough moved to England, and in 1899 matriculated from Trinity College in the University of Cambridge, where he studied Medieval and Modern Languages. He graduated BA (Class I) in 1902, MA in 1906, after which he taught French and German at Cambridge colleges and lectured in the university.\n\nAt this time Bullough became interested in aesthetics, and \"prepared himself to deal with [its] problems … by a study of physiology and general psychology\". In 1907 Bullough gave a course of lectures in aesthetics, the first such at Cambridge, privately printed as \"The Modern Conception of Aesthetics\". He repeated the course annually \"until shortly before his death\". Bullough conducted experimental work on the perception of colours in the Cambridge Psychological Laboratory, the basis for a series of three papers in the \"British Journal of Psychology\": \"The Apparent Heaviness of Colours\" (1907), \"The 'Perceptive Problem' in the Aesthetic Appreciation of Single Colours\" (1908), and \"The 'Perceptive Problem' in the Aesthetic Appreciation of Simple Colour-Combinations\" (1910). Bullough also had an interest in parapsychology, and was a member of the Society for Psychical Research.\n\nIn 1908 Bullough married Enrichetta Angelica Marchetti (daughter of the actor Eleonora Duse), with whom he would have a son and a daughter. He was elected to a Drosier Fellowship at Gonville and Caius College in 1912, and in the same year published his noted theoretical paper, Psychical Distance' as a Factor in Art and an Aesthetic Principle\". Psychical distance (Bullough capitalises the words) is that which, in certain situations, \"appears to lie between our own self and its affections, using the latter term in its broadest sense as anything which affects our being\". Artistic production and appreciation are two such situations.[Psychical Distance] has a \"negative\", inhibitory aspect—the cutting-out of the practical sides of things and of our practical attitude to them—and a \"positive\" side—the elaboration of the experience on the new basis created by the inhibitory action of Distance.\n\nThe relation between self and object remains a personal one (it is not like the impersonal relation in scientific observation, for example) and Bullough thinks that a \"concordance\" between them is necessary for aesthetic appreciation. However this must not be such that psychical distance is lost: Bullough imagines a jealous husband watching a performance of \"Othello\", who \"will probably do anything but appreciate the play\". This \"antinomy of Distance\" leads Bullough to say that what is desirable in art, \"both in appreciation and production\", is \"the utmost decrease of Distance without its disappearance\".\n\nIn the First World War, Bullough was recruited as a civilian in the summer of 1915 to the Admiralty's cryptoanalysis section, Room 40. He served for four years, finally as a Lieutenant of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. After the war he returned to Caius, where he had been re-elected to a fellowship in January 1915. He published in the \"British Journal of Psychology\" two more papers on aesthetic theory, \"The Relation of Aesthetics to Psychology\" (1919) and \"Mind and Medium in Art\" (1920), and a review of experimental work (1921). In 1920, he was appointed College Lecturer in modern languages and University Lecturer in German, and he edited the anthology \"Cambridge Readings in Italian Literature\".\n\nIn 1923 Bullough resigned his university post, wishing to concentrate instead on Italian. The same year, he joined the Roman Catholic Church as a Dominican Tertiary, and afterwards was active in the Cambridge University Catholic Association. In the following decade he published translations of Étienne Gilson, Karl Adam, and Achille Ratti (by then Pope Pius XI), and gave three papers on Dante at Catholic summer schools in Cambridge and Salzburg. A colleague believed that his work in Italian studies \"all went into his lectures and teaching\", rather than research for publication. He was appointed University Lecturer in Italian in 1926.\n\nBullough was elected to the Chair of Italian at Cambridge in March 1933. In his printed inaugural lecture, titled \"Italian Perspectives\", he claims that the Italian \"perspective\" is one of \"continuity of classical with medieval and modern times\", so that tradition is treated \"with the easy familiarity of a family possession\". He argues that because the European classical tradition is also, for the Italian, the native tradition, \"the 'national' inheritance of Italy lies at the same time embedded in the foundations of Europe\". In illustration, Bullough proposes Roman law, the Renaissance, and the Romantic movement as \"three contributions made by Italy to the patrimony of the civilised world\". He offers the contemporary fascist movement as a tentative fourth: a successor to the chair, Uberto Limentani, believed there was \"no doubt\" that Bullough sympathised with fascism.\n\nAfter a short illness resulting from an internal operation, Bullough died in a nursing home in Bath on 17 September 1934. He was buried at Woodchester Priory in Stroud. The philosopher Michael Oakeshott, a colleague at Caius, wrote Bullough's obituary for their college record.\n\nThe family home on Buckingham Road, Cambridge was offered to the Dominican Order by his widow and is now Cambridge Blackfriars.\n\nNote that Bullough's texts and translations of other authors are collected after the chronological presentation.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8021088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8021088", "title": "Environmental sculpture", "text": "Environmental sculpture\n\nEnvironmental sculpture is sculpture that creates or alters the environment for the viewer, as opposed to presenting itself figurally or monumentally before the viewer. A frequent trait of larger environmental sculptures is that one can actually enter or pass through the sculpture and be partially or completely surrounded by it. Also, in the same spirit, it may be designed to generate shadows or reflections, or to color the light in the surrounding area.\n\nJulia M. Bush emphasizes the nonfigurative aspect of such works: \"Environmental sculpture is never made to work at exactly human scale, but is sufficiently larger or smaller than scale to avoid confusion with the human image in the eyes of the viewer.\" Ukrainian-born American sculptor Louise Nevelson is a pioneer of environmental sculpture in this sense. Busch (p. 27) also places the sculptures of Jane Frank, as well as some works by Tony Smith and David Smith, in this category. Some environmental sculpture so encompasses the observer that it verges on architecture.\n\nGeorge Segal, Duane Hanson, Edward Kienholz, Robert Smithson, Christo, and Michael Heizer are well known practitioners of the genre, although Segal and Hanson's work is figural. Many figurative works of George Segal, for example, do qualify as environmental, in that—instead of being displayed on a pedestal as presentations to be gazed upon—they occupy and perturb the setting in which they are placed. A well known instance of this is the pair of Segal figures that sit on and stand next to one of the public benches in New York City's Sheridan Square; anyone can sit amongst them.\n\nA less known but more appropriate example is Athena Tacha's park \"Connections\" in downtown Philadelphia (between 18th St. and 19th St. two blocks north of Vine St.), created as a landscape art environment after her winning a competition in 1980 (where Segal was actually one of the finalists). It was the first park designed entirely by an artist \"sculpting the land\" with planted terraces, rock clusters and paths (completed in 1992).\n\nA second sense of the term \"environmental sculpture\", with a somewhat different emphasis, is sculpture \"created for\" a particular set of surroundings. Thus, contemporary sculptor Beth Galston writes: \"An environmental sculptor plans a piece from the very beginning in relationship to its surroundings. The site is a catalyst, becoming part of the creative process.\" This is quite different from a Nevelson sculpture, which can usually be moved from place to place, like a conventional sculpture, without losing its meaning and effectiveness.\n\nBy Galston's definition, an environmental sculpture is not merely site-specific art as many conventional, figurative, marble monuments were created for specific sites. Galston stresses that environmental sculpture entails the idea that the piece also functions to alter or permeate the existing environment or even to create a new environment in which the viewer is invited to participate: \"The finished sculpture and site become one integrated unit, working together to create a unified mood or atmosphere,\" she writes. Many of the large, site-specific, minimalist sculptures of Richard Serra also qualify as environmental sculpture, in both senses described here. Much of what is called \"land art\" or \"earth art\" could also be termed environmental sculpture under this definition. Andrew Rogers and Alan Sonfist (which see) are among notable current practitioners of land art.\n\nSince the mid-seventies, French artist Jean-Max Albert worked with trellis structures, deconstructing and re-arranging the elements of surrounding architecture or including the site into the sculpture with Sculptures Bachelard.\n\nSince 1983 German artist Eberhard Bosslet makes interventions on ruins, so-called \"Re/formations and side effects\"; he refers to the conditions of industrial and residential buildings by white painted lines or black painted color fields. In 1999 the artist Elena Paroucheva created her concept for pylons, integrating energy networks with sculptures.http://www.art-elena.com/\n\nThe term \"site-specific art\" is sometimes used interchangeably with \"environmental art\". Louise Nevelson, for instance is a pioneer American environmental artist with sources disagreeing on classifying her work as \"environmental sculpture\". The terms \"environment sculpture\", \"site-specific art\", and \"environmental art\" have not yet completely stabilized in their meanings.\n\nA reason for blurred definitions is that much of site-specific and environmental art was created from 1970 on for public spaces all over the United States, sponsored by federal (GSA and NEA) or state and city Percent for Art competitions, and many of the artists were women trying to succeed outside the established art-gallery world. Younger art historians will have to sort out the development of this marginalized \"movement\" and the importance of artists such as Olga Kisseleva, Patricia Johanson, Athena Tacha, Mary Miss, Alice Adams, Elyn Zimmerman, Merle Temkin and others who, from the early 1970s on, won and executed large outdoor public art commissions with new formal, kinesthetic and social underpinnings. Many of these artists were also ecologically conscious and created works that could offer a further definition of \"environmental sculpture\": art that is environmentally friendly and cares for the natural environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "17112496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17112496", "title": "Ephigenia of Ethiopia", "text": "Ephigenia of Ethiopia\n\nSaint Ephigenia of Ethiopia or Iphigenia of Ethiopia (; ; ; ), also called Iphigenia of Abyssinia (1st century), is a folk saint whose life is told in the \"Golden Legend\" as a virgin converted to Christianity and then consecrated to God by St. Matthew the Apostle, who was spreading the Gospel to the region of \"Ethiopia\", which in this case is understood to be located in the regions south of the Caspian Sea, either in one of the provinces of Mesopotamia (Assyria and Babylon), or in Ancient Armenia (Colchis).\n\nAccording to the legend, Ephigenia was the daughter of Ethiopian King Egippus. She was dedicated to God by Saint Matthew the Apostle, who veiled her.\n\nWhen Hirtacus succeeded the King, he promised the apostle half of his kingdom if he could persuade Ephigenia to marry him. Matthew thus invited the king to Mass the following Sunday where he explained that she was already espoused to the eternal King and thus could not be purloined by Hirtacus. The king thus sent a swordsman to kill Matthew who stood at the altar, making him a martyr.\n\nNot having managed to bend Ephigenia to his will, Hirtacus tried to destroy her home with fire. However, the apostle appeared and warded the flames from the house, turning them upon the royal palace. The king's son was seized by the devil and the king himself contracted leprosy, eventually killing himself.\n\nThe people thus chose Ephigenia's brother as their king, who reigned for seventy years, leaving his kingdom to his son who filled Egypt with Christian churches.\n\nSaint Ephigenia's feast day in the Roman Catholic Church, along with Saint Matthew's, is on September 21.\n\nThe oldest textual source of her \"Life\" seems to be the \"Legenda Aurea\" (\"Golden Legend\", also known as the \"Historia Longobardica\" or \"Flos Sanctorum\") of Italian chronicler Jacobus de Voragine, compiled around 1275 AD. This was an influential book on Renaissance spirituality and the understanding of sanctity which was read not only as a hagiography - a collection of lives of the saints - but as a \"vade mecum\", a manual of asceticism. This is the manner in which Ignatius of Loyola employed it and how Teresa of Ávila advised her spiritual sisters that it should be used.\n\nSaint Ephigenia is also listed in the hagiography of the Venetian Bishop Petrus de Natalibus (d. circa 1400), and appears in the 1586 edition of the \"Roman Martyrology\" of Cardinal Caesar Baronius, the first authoritative edition of the \"Roman Martyrology.\"\n\nThe Bollandists included an entry for Saint Iphigenia in their \"Acta Sanctorum\" for September 21. She is listed in a German language Bollandist-derived collection of saints of 1869. Professor Roberto Sánchez in his paper \" 'The Black Virgin: Santa Efigenia, Popular Religion, and the African Diaspora in Peru' \" notes the following about the Bollandist account:\n\n\"The Bollandists, whose work is to historicize and contextualize the lives of the saints, concede that there is some doubt as to whether St. Matthew even went to Ethiopia. They conclude however that the legend is consistent with other sources and apocryphal writings of the period. It is clear that the story of Santa Efígenia is written as a corollary to the keen interest in the martyrdom of St. Matthew. His martyrdom is a significant historical event that has been subject of different versions. In effect, the origins of Santa Efigenia are shrouded in myth, folklore, and a spirited ecclesiastical historical debate.\"\n\nThe Austrian Jesuit missionary and author Francis Xavier Weninger (D.D., S.J.) included the life of Saint Ephigenia in his \"Lives of the Saints\" (1876), inscribed within the life of Saint Matthew on September 21:\n\n\"...Incontestible writings prove that he preached the Gospel for twenty-three years, partly in Ethiopia, partly in other countries, at the same time founding almost innumerable Churches, and supplying them with priests and bishops, in order to preserve the faith he had taught... ...Iphigenia, the eldest daughter of the newly converted king of Ethiopia, had not only become a Christian, but also, with the knowledge and consent of the holy Apostle, had consecrated her virginity to the Almighty, after having frequently heard the Saint preach on the priceless value of purity, and exhort others to guard and preserve it. Her example was followed by many other virgins, who, choosing the princess as their superior, lived together and occupied their time in prayer and work...\"\n\nHer listing in the \"Roman Martyrology\" (1916 English edition) states the following:\n\n\"In Ethiopia, St. Iphigenia, virgin, who being baptized and consecrated to God by the blessed apostle Matthew, ended her holy life in peace.\"\n\nThe \"Book of Saints\" (1921) compiled by the Benedictine Monks of St Augustine's Abbey, Ramsgate has the following entry for Saint Iphigenia:\n\n\"A Virgin converted to Christianity and afterwards consecrated to God by St. Matthew the Evangelist, Apostle of Ethiopia. The extant Acts of St. Matthew are however so untrustworthy that no reliance can be placed on the particulars given therein of St Iphigenia and others of the first fruits of the Gospel in Ethiopia.\"\n\nThe Slaves of the Immaculate Heart of Mary also recount the life of Saint Iphigenia:\n\n\"Saint Matthew, the Publican, preached the gospel in Ethiopia. He is, as Bartholomew for Armenia, an Apostle of a Nation, because, not only did he make many converts (as did all the Twelve) but he converted the king of Ethiopia by the stupendous miracle of raising the king’s daughter from the dead. Her name was Iphigenia and she is listed as a saint in the Martyrology. After her resurrection from the dead, with Saint Matthew’s approval, she took a vow of virginity. This so enraged the next king, Hirtacus, who wanted to marry her, that he had Matthew slain at the altar while offering Mass. The year was 68. Saint Matthew’s feast day is September 21.\"\n\nSaint Ephigenia is also listed in \"Our Sunday Visitor's Encyclopedia of Saints\" (2014, 2nd edition):\n\n\"Iphigenia (d. first century). A virgin from Ethiopia who was converted by St. Matthew . No other reliable details about her are extant. Feast day: September 21.\"\n\nThe Anglican Catholic Church records the memory of Saint Ephigenia, contained within the \"Life\" of Saint Matthew, citing \"The Anglican Breviary\" (1955):\n\n\"Although many parts of Christendom have delighted to claim this Apostle as the founder of their Churches, the usual tradition is that he went into the regions south of the Caspian Sea, (which same are in this instance called Ethiopia) where he preached the Gospel and confirmed the same by many wondrous deeds. The greatest of these is told on this wise: that he raised to life the king's daughter, Iphigenia, whereby the royal family was converted to Christ; that after the king died Hirtacus his successor demanded Iphigenia to wife; and that she (who through Matthew's teaching had vowed herself to God) rejected Hirtacus in pursuance of her vow; for which reason Matthew was by royal order put to death whilst celebrating the holy Mysteries, whereby he fulfilled his apostleship in martyrdom.\"\n\nSignificantly, the \"Life\" of Saint Matthew the Apostle in traditional Orthodox Synaxaria does not directly mention Saint Ephigenia by name, although the Synaxaria do record Saint Matthew's travels to \"Ethiopia\", that he enlightened the area, and was martyred there. The Orthodox Synaxarion according to the tradition of Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos (c. 1320), states that after being cruelly treated by the Parthians and Medes, St. Matthew then went to spread the Gospel to a certain city called \"Mirmena / Myrmena\", supposedly in Ethiopia, described as a land that was inhabited by tribes of cannibals:\n\n\"After departing from Jerusalem, the holy Apostle Matthew preached the glad tidings of the Gospel in many lands. Proclaiming the good news of Christ, he passed through Macedonia, Syria, Persia, Parthia and Media, establishing Churches there and in other places...He travelled all about Ethiopia, which had fallen to him by lot, and enlightened it with the light of the knowledge of the Gospel. Finally, guided by the Holy Spirit, he arrived in the land of the cannibals, who were a dark-skinned and savage people. There he entered a city known as Mirmena and, having converted several souls to Christ, he appointed Platon, his fellow traveller, to be their bishop, and built a little church...The wife and son of Fulvian, the price of that city, were possessed by demons...The apostle rebuked the unclean spirits and expelled them; and those who were healed fell down before the apostle and meekly followed after him...\"\n\nBe that as it may, a certain \"Saint Iphigenia the Virgin-Martyr\" is yet referenced in the Greek Orthodox calendar for November 16 (being the same feast day as Saint Matthew the Apostle in the Orthodox Church). She is inscribed in a single modern hagiographic source, namely the \"Small Euchologion or Agiasmatarion\" published by the in 1956, without any other information provided therein. The source is most likely a \"local\" Greek account, which refers to this Saint Iphigenia as \"Saint Iphigenia the Virgin-Martyr of Pontus\", maytyred in 68 AD at the age of 15. This local account makes her a young virgin-martyr and places her in Pontus, which is apparently at odds with the account in the \"Golden Legend,\" which places her in \"Ethiopia\", includes Saint Matthew in the story and makes Ephigenia an abbess.\n\nTherefore there are two possibilities: 1) either the details of her current \"Life\" are a confused conflation of these two different traditions, if indeed she was a single individual; or otherwise, 2) it is possible that there were two distinct Saints named \"Iphigenia\", both dating from the first century: one from Pontus who was martyred in 68 AD aged 15, based on the local Greek account; and a different one from \"Ethiopia\" (i.e. \"Asiatic Ethiopia\"), based on the medieval account in the \"Golden Legend\".\n\nThe \"Prologue from Ohrid\" compiled by Nikolai Velimirovic (1928) does not include St. Ephigenia, either on her own or within the life of Saint Matthew.\n\nThe Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America does include St. Ephigenia of Ethiopia on its calendar of Saints, along with her traditional Latin biography, \"commemorated on November 16 (also on September 21)\". Similarly, Saints Mary and Martha Monastery in Wagener, South Carolina (OCA), does list St. Iphigenia, Princess of Ethiopia on the Western date of September 21, although the Orthodox Church in America's (OCA) online \"Synaxarion\" does not mention St. Iphigenia in its recollection of the Life of St. Matthew the Evangelist, including his period in Ethiopia.\n\nSaint Ephigenia of Ethiopia does not appear to be listed in either the Coptic Synaxarium or in the Ethiopian Synaxarium, either on her own, or within the life of Saint Matthew.\n\nThe Carmelites of Cádiz, Andalusia, had a devotion to Santa Ifigênia. In Cádiz, African blacks organized their own religious association, the \"Confradia de Nuestra Senora de le Salud, San Bello y Santa Ifigênia\", formed in El Puerto de Santa María in 1575. From Cádiz, her devotion spread to Portugal and from there to Brazil.\n\nThe Brazilian-born priest José Pereira de Santana devoted a definitive, two-volume work to Elesbaan and Ephigenia, published respectively in 1735 and 1738 at Lisbon. He considered them the two pillars of African sanctity and refashioned them as saints of his own Carmelite order. Elesbaan represented the triumph of Christianity over Judaism in the person of Dunaan, while Ephigenia stood for the early, voluntary acceptance of the Gospel in Africa.\n\nA \"Venerable Brotherhood of Saint Elesbão and Saint Efigênia\" was founded in Rio de Janeiro on May 7, 1740, by free black slaves from Cape Verde, Coast of the Mine, São Tomé Island, and Mozambique. The cult of those two Saints is believed to have been brought by the slaves themselves. Black brotherhoods in Roman Catholic societies in the New World relied upon a few black patron saints, including Santa Efigenia, Santo (d. 1549), and Sao Benedito (d. 1589).\n\nSaint Iphigenia was also honored in joyous religious festivals and processions. According to Brazilian sociologist and anthropologist Gilberto Freyre, writing in 1922, \"the festival of Saint Ephigenia, a sort of black Madonna, was enjoyed to the utmost by the colored folks, whose \"consciousness of kind\" was ably aroused by the priests.\"\n\nOn November 20, 1995 Brazilians observed the 300th anniversary of the death of Zumbi of Palmers, the last ruler of Palmares, regarded as one of the first freedom fighters of the Americas. In Belo Horizonte a procession of \"congados\" () took place on the evening of November 23, 1996, honoring Nossa Senhora do Rosario, Saint Benedict the Moor, and Saint Iphigenia with processions of precision marching, singing, dancing and the use of percussion instruments. The combined reverence for the Catholic saints and the performance of African ritual elements are evidence of the co-existence of Catholic religious traditions and the preservation of an African cultural memory in Minas Gerais.\n\nThe diaspora of Santa Efígenia from Ethiopia to the Americas was part of the dispersal of African popular religious expressions that connected Africa, Europe, and the Americas.\n\nA late twentieth century movement to gain national recognition of Afro-Peruvian cultural contributions in Cañete Province focused on Santa Efigenia, which included a statue and an eighteenth century wall-sized baroque painting of her by Peruvian artist Cristóbal Lozano. These artistic representations located in a private chapel on the hacienda La Quebrada in San Luis de Cañete were presented as legitimate artifacts of Santa Efigenia’s status as a folk or popular saint central to their construction of an Afro-Peruvian black identity and culture of devotion.\n\nOn August 20, 1994 Sabino Cañas, an Afro-Peruvian community leader, organized a small group of followers from the surrounding villages of Cañete and Chincha to establish the Santa Efigenia Association, and named her as Patroness of National Black Art, even as they struggled to craft a coherent historical narrative of Santa Efigenia’s origins. According to the Association’s popular history, Santa Efígenia has been at the hacienda of La Quebrada since approximately 1741.\n\nAn annual celebration of Santa Efígenia is held on September 21 each year, with processions made in homage to Santa Ifigenia in the district of San Luis de Canete. The Association produces a program flyer that introduces a brief history of the patron saint and focuses on her diffusion and popularity in Brazil, Cuba, and Peru. The festival has grown in popularity as the Afro-Peruvian community of artists, musicians, writers, sports figures, and admirers have converged on Cañete each September in growing numbers.\n\nIn honor of Saint Ephigenia, a virgin-martyr of 1794 had taken her name. A professed religious of the Order of St. Benedict that was martyred during the French Revolution in 1794 was known as \"Sister Iphigénie of Saint Matthew\". Her name was Blessed Marie-Gabrielle-Françoise-Suzanne de Gaillard de Lavaldène (1761–1794), also known as \"Francesca Maria Susanna\", \"Sister Iphigénie of Saint Matthew\" or \"Ifigenia di San Matteo de Gaillard de la Valdène\", and she was one of the Martyrs of Orange who was guillotined on 7 July 1794 in Orange, Vaucluse, France. She was beatified 10 May 1925 by Pope Pius XI and she is commemorated on July 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His father Karl, also a painter, was his teacher. The family moved to Venice when Karl became Professor at the Academy of Venice. He often painted scenes in Venice, but also portraits and religious paintings.\n\nAmong his works are \"La forma nuziale in sacrestia\"; \"La tombola in Campielo a Venezia\"; \"Una scena di burattini in un educanciatu\"; and \"La Ninetta\".

{"id": "30535691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30535691", "title": "Fan Ho", "text": "Fan Ho\n\nFan Ho (; 8 October 1931 – 19 June 2016) was a celebrated Chinese photographer, film director, and actor. From 1956, he won over 280 awards from international exhibitions and competitions worldwide for his photography.\n\nFan Ho was born in Shanghai in 1931, and emigrated with his family to Hong Kong in 1949. At the outbreak of war in 1941, Ho's parents were stranded in Macau for several years and Ho was left in the care of a family servant. Ho began photographing at a very young age with a Brownie which his father had left at home, and later with a Rolleiflex twin-lens reflex camera his father gave him at the age of 14. Largely self-taught, his photos display a fascination with urban life, explored alleys, slums, markets and streets. Much of his work consists of candid photographs of the street vendors and children only a few years younger than himself. He developed his images in the family bathtub and soon had built up a significant body of work, chronicling Hong Kong in the 1950s and 1960s as it was becoming a major metropolitan centre. Ho would use the same Rolleiflex K4A throughout his career.\n\nUpon seeing Ho's work for the first time in 2006, gallery owner Laurence Miller commented that \"[they] felt like direct descendants of the Bauhaus, yet they were made in Hong Kong. They were abstract and humanistic at the same time.\"\n\nHo was a Fellow of the Photographic Society of America, the Royal Photographic Society and the Royal Society of Arts in England, and an Honorary Member of the Photographic Societies of Singapore, Argentina, Brazil, Germany, France, Italy and Belgium. Ho was named one of the \"Top Ten Photographers of the World\" by the Photographic Society of America between 1958 and 1965.\n\n\"Approaching Shadow\" () was one of Ho's most famous works. He asked a cousin to pose by a wall at Queen's College in Causeway Bay and added a diagonal shadow in the darkroom to symbolize that \"her youth will fade away\" since \"everyone has the same destiny\". A print of \"Approaching Shadow\" sold for a record in 2015.\n\nHo was an accomplished and acclaimed Hong Kong film director and actor.\n\nHe joined Shaw Brothers in 1961 to develop his career in cinema. He started as a continuity assistant in the movie \"The Swallow\" (1961) and moved on to act in several movies for Shaw. Ho won praise for his performance as the Monk, Tripitaka, in the lavish Shaw Brothers adaption of \"Journey to the West\" four-picture cycle of films. Ho became disillusioned with Shaw's revenue-driven formula, and sought creative relief in photography and in other studios.\n\nDuring the early 1960s he also produced a pioneering series of independent short films, the first of which, \"Big City Little Man\" (大都市 小人物; 1963, 30 min), won the \"Honor Award Certificate\" from the Japan International Film Festival in 1964.\n\nHo left Shaw Brothers in 1969 to develop his career as a director, making over 20 films with various studios in Hong Kong and Taiwan. He has had three films in the \"Official Selection\" of the International Film Festivals of Cannes, Berlin and San Francisco; and five of his films have been selected in the \"Permanent Collection\" of the National Film Archives of Taiwan and Hong Kong. As well as his independent film work he is acclaimed for pioneering the erotic field (Category III films) in cinema, with such cult films as \"Adventure in Denmark\" (1973), \"The Girl with the Long Hair\" (1975) and the highly successful \"Temptation Summary\" (1990).\n\nAccording to Mark Pinsukanjana, director of Modernbook Gallery in San Francisco, CA, his debut feature, \"Lost\" (1969), was Ho's favourite. As Pinsukanjana says:\n\nIn \"Lost\", one will see the chaotic life of one man in Hong Kong. The film follows him and finds the beauty that surrounds him; he is lost because he never saw it. I think that one can say that this is similar to Fan Ho's photographs in the sense that Hong Kong is crowded, busy and chaotic to many, but for Fan Ho, he was able to convert [what he found] and find beauty.\"\n\nHe also served on the jury of the Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Festival and Hong Kong Film Award.\n\nHo's wife and children emigrated to San Jose, California in 1979 to pursue a university education and he followed in 1995 after retiring from cinema. Restless in retirement, Ho's health began to decline until his family suggested that he pursue photography again. Rather than using modern equipment and taking photographs locally in the San Francisco Bay Area, Ho went through his old negatives from Hong Kong and began showing his portfolio to local galleries.\n\nHe exhibited slides of his photographs, some of which were in the permanent collection at SFMOMA, at the 1998 New Asian Cinema Festival, which was screening his 1988 film \"Carnal Desire\" at the 4 Star Theater in San Francisco. A chance meeting with Mark Pinsukanjana in 1999 led to Ho being featured at Pinsukanjana's Modernbook Gallery in Palo Alto in 2000, his first solo exhibition since the 1960s, and in 2001, and Ho's films and photographs continued to be shown at festivals hosted at the 4 Star. Ho's daughter credits the first Palo Alto exhibition in 2000 with restoring Ho's confidence and happiness.\n\nModernbook went on to stage his vintage work at photoLA in January 2006, and upon seeing his photographs of Hong Kong, fellow gallery owner Laurence Miller was moved to acquire 26 prints and put on a solo exhibit for Ho in New York City later that year. Ho would go on to publish a new monograph, \"Hong Kong Yesterday\" in 2006 after receiving international attention for this early work. By compositing old negatives, Ho continued to produce new prints of scenes that have now vanished from modern Hong Kong. Many of the resulting composited prints were published for the first time in his final monograph \"A Hong Kong Memoir\" in 2014, following exhibits of the same title at Modernbook in summer 2011 and from December 2014 to January 2015.\n\nHe died in San Jose on 19 June 2016 of pneumonia at the age of 84. Posthumously, thirty-two photographs taken in 1950s Hong Kong as well as related objects, including his Rolleiflex camera and an early book, \"Thoughts on Street Photography\", were exhibited at Sotheby's Hong Kong gallery in the last half of June 2017. A new monograph, \"Portrait of Hong Kong\", was published in June 2017 to coincide with the exhibition.\n\n\"Portrait of Hong Kong\" 《舊香港人的舊》 contains 153 new street photographs which were selected from 500 negatives chosen by Ho before he died in 2016. After his death, the surviving family members spent about a year completing the project, together with support from Sarah Greene (Blue Lotus Consultancy) and WE Press (香港人出版). 20 quotable excerpts from Ho's earliest book, \"Thoughts on Street Photography\" 《街頭攝影叢談》, were included. These 153 photographs provide not only glimpses of Hong Kong in the 1950s and 1960s but also recall the indomitable spirit of the people at the time This body of realistic street photographs were never highly recognized during 1950s and 1960s, despite being Ho's favorites, as quoted in Ho’s reply to Sarah Greene during one of her visits to Ho in early 2016. The quote appeared in the afterword of his latest monograph: \n\nHo's family also established a website to celebrate his life and work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "324863", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=324863", "title": "Formalism (philosophy)", "text": "Formalism (philosophy)\n\nThe term formalism describes an emphasis on form over content or meaning in the arts, literature, or philosophy. A practitioner of formalism is called a formalist. A formalist, with respect to some discipline, holds that there is no transcendent meaning to that discipline other than the literal content created by a practitioner. For example, formalists within mathematics claim that mathematics is no more than the symbols written down by the mathematician, which is based on logic and a few elementary rules alone. This is as opposed to non-formalists, within that field, who hold that there are some things inherently true, and are not, necessarily, dependent on the symbols within mathematics so much as a greater truth. Formalists within a discipline are completely concerned with \"the rules of the game,\" as there is no other external truth that can be achieved beyond those given rules. In this sense, formalism lends itself well to disciplines based upon axiomatic systems.\n\nFormalism in religion means an emphasis on ritual and observance over their meanings. Within Christianity, the term legalism is a derogatory term that is loosely synonymous to religious formalism.\n\nFormalism is a school of thought in law and jurisprudence which assumes that the law is a system of rules that can determine the outcome of any case, without reference to external norms. For example, formalism animates the commonly heard criticism that \"judges should apply the law, not make it.\" To formalism's rival, legal realism, this criticism is incoherent, because legal realism assumes that, at least in difficult cases, all applications of the law will require that a judge refer to external (i.e. non-legal) sources, such as the judge's conception of justice, or commercial norms.\n\nIn general in the study of the arts and literature, \"formalism\" refers to the style of criticism that focuses on artistic or literary techniques in themselves, in separation from the work's social and historical context. \n\nGenerally speaking, formalism is the concept which everything necessary in a work of art is contained within it. The context for the work, including the reason for its creation, the historical background, and the life of the artist, is not considered to be significant. Examples of formalist aestheticians are Clive Bell, Jerome Stolnitz, and Edward Bullough.\n\nIn contemporary discussions of literary theory, the school of criticism of I. A. Richards and his followers, traditionally the New Criticism, has sometimes been labelled 'formalist'. The formalist approach, in this sense, is a continuation of aspects of classical rhetoric. \n\nRussian formalism was a twentieth century school, based in Eastern Europe, with roots in linguistic studies and also theorising on fairy tales, in which content is taken as secondary since the tale 'is' the form, the princess 'is' the fairy-tale princess.\n\nIn modern poetry, \"Formalist poets\" may be considered as the opposite of writers of free verse. These are only labels, and rarely sum up matters satisfactorily. 'Formalism' in poetry represents an attachment to poetry that recognises and uses schemes of rhyme and rhythm to create poetic effects and to innovate. To distinguish it from archaic poetry the term 'neo-formalist' is sometimes used.\n\nSee for example:\n\nIn film studies, formalism is a trait in filmmaking, which overtly uses the language of film, such as editing, shot composition, camera movement, set design, etc., so as to emphasise graphical (as opposed to diegetic) qualities of the image. Strict formalism, condemned by realist film theorists such as André Bazin, has declined substantially in popular usage since the 1950s, though some more postmodern filmmakers reference it to suggest the artificiality of the film experience. \n\nExamples of formalist films may include Resnais's \"Last Year at Marienbad\" and Parajanov's \"The Color of Pomegranates\".\n\nFormalism can be applied to a set of notations and rules for manipulating them which yield results in agreement with experiment or other techniques of calculation. These rules and notations may or may not have a corresponding mathematical semantics. In the case no mathematical semantics exists, the calculations are often said to be \"purely formal\". See for example scientific formalism.\n\nIn the foundations of mathematics, formalism is associated with a certain rigorous mathematical method: see formal system. In common usage, \"a\" formalism means the out-turn of the effort towards formalisation of a given limited area. In other words, matters can be formally discussed once captured in a formal system, or commonly enough within something \"formalisable\" with claims to be one. Complete formalisation is in the domain of computer science.\n\nFormalism also more precisely refers to a certain school in the philosophy of mathematics, stressing axiomatic proofs through theorems, specifically associated with David Hilbert. In the philosophy of mathematics, therefore, a formalist is a person who belongs to the school of formalism, which is a certain mathematical-philosophical doctrine descending from Hilbert.\n\nIn economic anthropology, formalism is the theoretical perspective that the principles of neoclassical economics can be applied to our understanding of all human societies.\n\n"}

You and Me\n\nFree to Be… You and Me was a children's entertainment project, conceived, created and executive-produced by actress and author Marlo Thomas. Produced in collaboration with the Ms. Foundation for Women, it was a record album and illustrated book first released in November 1972 featuring songs and stories sung or told by celebrities of the day (credited as \"Marlo Thomas and Friends\") including Alan Alda, Rosey Grier, Cicely Tyson, Carol Channing, Michael Jackson, Roberta Flack, Shirley Jones, Jack Cassidy, and Diana Ross. An ABC special, also created by Marlo Thomas, using poetry, songs, and sketches followed two years later in March 1974. The basic concept was to encourage post-1960s gender neutrality, saluting values such as individuality, tolerance, and comfort with one's identity. A major thematic message is that anyone—whether a boy or a girl—can achieve anything.\n\nThe original idea to create the album began with Marlo Thomas, who wanted to teach her then-young niece Dionne about life, in particular that it is acceptable to refute or reject the gender stereotypes expressed in children's books of the period. In an Emmy Legends interview Thomas explains:\n\nI told my sister Terre \"it would take Dionne 30 years to get over it (stories featuring traditional gender roles) the same as it took all of us. We need to find her some different books to read\" and she said \"You go and find 'em.\" \n\nWell there weren't any. And not only weren't there any, I was in the bookstore one day looking around and found this one (picture book - I'm Glad I'm a Boy! I'm Glad I'm a Girl! by Whitney Darrow, Jr.) that showed a pilot on one page and a stewardess on a facing page (with a caption) that said \"Boys are pilots, girls are stewardesses.\" Well I nearly had a heart attack right there in the bookstore. \n\nSo I said \"I'll make a record for Dionne. I'll ask everybody to donate their talents and it'll be fun.\" Larry Uttal at Bell Records told me, this kind of record might sell 15,000 copies tops. Well it went Gold right away, went Platinum within two years and went Diamond in under ten years. EVERYBODY was amazed it had touched such a nerve. It's still in the top 100 albums of all time over 40 years later.\n\nProduced by Carole Hart, with music produced by Stephen J. Lawrence and Bruce Hart, with stories and poems directed by Alan Alda, the title has never been out of print.\n\nProceeds went to the Ms. Foundation for Women. The album was originally released on Bell Records in 1972 and since 1975 has been available on Arista Records cassettes and CDs. \n\nWell-known songs include \"It's All Right to Cry,\" sung by football hero Rosey Grier; the title track by the New Seekers; \"Helping,\" a Shel Silverstein poem performed by Tom Smothers; \"Sisters and Brothers\" by the Voices of East Harlem; and \"When We Grow Up\" performed by Diana Ross on the album and by Roberta Flack and a teenage Michael Jackson on the special.\n\nOther sketches, some of them animated in the television special, include \"Atalanta,\" co-narrated by Thomas and Alda, a retelling of the ancient Greek legend of Atalanta; \"Boy Meets Girl\" with Thomas and Mel Brooks providing the voices for puppets, designed, performed and manipulated by Wayland Flowers, resembling human babies, who use cultural gender stereotypes to try to discover which is a boy and which a girl; \"William's Doll\", based on Charlotte Zolotow's picture book about a boy whose family resists his requests for a doll until his grandmother explains that William wishes to practice being a good father; and \"Dudley Pippin\" with Robert Morse and Billy De Wolfe, based on stories by Phil Ressner.\n\nA number of pieces from the record did not make the special, most for lack of time, although \"Housework\" was left off due to the somewhat condescending tone it lent to its' description of domestic workers.\n\nMarlo Thomas says in the Emmy Legends 40th anniversary interview:\n\nThe children pictured on the original LP jacket were schoolmates of Abigail, Robin, and David Pogrebin, children of Letty Cottin Pogrebin, then editor of \"Ms.\" Most of the children attended Corlears School.\n\n\"Marlo Thomas and Friends\" followed \"Free to Be... You and Me\" with a 1988 sequel, \"Free to Be... a Family\", the first primetime variety show created and produced in both the United States and the Soviet Union.\n\nIn her 2010 memoir, \"Growing Up Laughing\", Marlo Thomas reflected on the astonishing impact the Free to Be projects had on the culture. \n\nThe show won an Emmy and a Peabody, the book became number one on the \"New York Times\" best-seller list and the record went gold. We were floored by the impact it all had. My little message for Dionne had gone straight to the hearts of moms and dads and aunties and uncles and, most of all, teachers, who embraced it as a way to teach the kids in their lives a new way of thinking about themselves.\n\nThe television special, produced by Marlo Thomas and Free to Be Productions, in association with Teru Murakami-Fred Wolf Films, Inc. and cosponsored by the Ms. Foundation, first aired March 11, 1974, on ABC. It earned an 18.6 rating/27 share and went on to win an Emmy. Sixteen-mm prints of the special were also struck, and some schoolchildren from the 1970s and 1980s remember seeing the television special, or the filmstrip based on the special, in their school during that period.\n\nThe special appeared occasionally on HBO in the 1980s. It was released on VHS through Vestron Video subsidiary Children's Video Library in 1983. It was also seen on the cable channel TV Land, yet has not been aired on any network since.\n\nA Region 1 DVD of the television special was released in November 2001, and in 2010, a newly remastered version was released featuring a number of new extras including a deleted scene showcasing Dustin Hoffman.\n\nSome material here is left out of the TV special and vice versa while other material appears only in the accompanying hardcover book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent performances than those included in the film – and not included on the original LP/CD\n\nIn March 2014, The Paley Center for Media hosted an event commemorating the 40th anniversary of \"Free to Be\", co-moderated by Marlo Thomas and Gloria Steinem, which included many of the participants in the original project.\n\nTo commemorate the 40th anniversary of the original project, a book called \"When We Were Free to Be: Looking Back at a Children's Classic and the Difference It Made\" was published.\n\n\"Free to Be\" faced backlash from some conservative religious leaders, including Evangelical author and psychologist James Dobson. Kyle Smith from the \"New York Post\" claimed the project emasculated men. \"The Daily Beast\" issued a rebuttal.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13166330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13166330", "title": "French furniture", "text": "French furniture\n\nFrench furniture comprises both the most sophisticated furniture made in Paris for king and court, aristocrats and rich upper bourgeoisie, on the one hand, and French provincial furniture made in the provincial cities and towns many of which, like Lyon and Liège, retained cultural identities distinct from the metropolis. There was also a conservative artisanal rural tradition of French country furniture which remained unbroken until the advent of the railroads in the mid-nineteenth century.\n\nFurniture made in provincial centers such as Blois and Orléans in the Loire valley, and at Lyon or Liège (Not part of France politically but within its cultural orbit), followed at some distance the design innovations that were initiated in the luxury trades of Paris, often with a time lag that could amount to decades.\n\nFeatures typically associated with French Provincial furniture include cabriole legs, and simple scalloped carving. Dining chairs often have a wheat pattern carving reflecting the country surroundings of the maker. The ladder back chair with a woven rush seat is the typical French Provincial dining chair. Finishes vary though common to all colours is the accumulation of polish or grime in the carving over time resulting in an aged patina and emphasis on the carving regardless of whether the furniture is painted or stained.\n\nIn the metropolitan culture of France, \"French furniture\", connoting Parisian furniture, embodies one of the mainstreams of design in the decorative arts of Europe, extending its influence from Spain to Sweden and Russia, from the late seventeenth century to the last craft traditions in workshops like Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann, which came to an end only with the Second World War. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, French furniture of the classic period 1660-1815, has been collected as passionately by non-French \"amateurs\", with the English in the historical lead, and has set record prices consistently, since the Hamilton Palace sale of 1882, with the result that it is represented in many national museums.\n\nIn Paris, an unbroken tradition of apprenticeship, already fully formed when the design center for luxury furnishings shifted from Antwerp to Paris in the 1630s, was slowly disrupted by the Industrial Revolution after the mid-nineteenth century. Perhaps the last of the Parisian \"ébénistes\" working from a traditional atelier was Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann (1879-1933).\n\nThe grand tradition of French royal furniture received its impetus from the establishment of the \"Manufacture royale des Gobelins\" under the organisation of the arts in the service of Louis XIV of France that was controlled and directed by his minister of finance, Colbert. Favoured craftsmen would be eligible for premises in the galleries of the Palais du Louvre, a practice that had been initiated on a small scale under Henri IV. At the Gobelins, much more than tapestry was made for the furnishing of the royal palaces and the occasional ambassadorial gift: the celebrated silver furnishings for the \"Galerie des Glaces\" at Versailles was produced by silversmiths working to designs by Charles Le Brun at the Gobelins.\n\nIn Paris, the furniture trade was divided among craft guilds with jealous regard for infringements. \"Menuisiers\" were solely occupied with carved furnishings, which included beds and all seat furniture, as they were for the carved \"boiseries\" of the interiors they were destined to occupy. Carvers and gilders worked directly for them. \"Ébénistes\", who drew their name from the ebony that they worked into cabinets that were carved in shallow relief and incorporated veneers of tortoiseshell and ivory, a specialty of Paris furniture in the mid-seventeenth century, retained their control over all carcase furniture that was intended to be veneered, often with elaborate marquetry. The bronze mounts that decorated these high-style case-pieces, from the 1660s to the abolition of guilds in the French Revolution, was furnished, and even carried to the ébéniste's workshop by separate guilds of foundrymen.\nFrench furniture of the Ancien Régime, often characterised by dealers and collectors by reign-names, as \"Louis Quinze furniture\", etc., can be seen as representative, even formative, manifestations of broader European styles: French Gothic furniture, of which so little has survived; French Renaissance furniture of the sixteenth century; Early Baroque furniture associated with Louis XIII, comparable to what was produced at Antwerp; sculptural and tectonic High Baroque furniture associated with Louis XIV; Rococo furniture, associated with the Régence and the reign of Louis XV; and Neoclassical furniture, associated with Louis XVI.\n\nFrench furniture of the Revolution and the First French Empire is imbued with a more severe, self-consciously archaeological phase of Neoclassicism, which began to lose its grip on styles in the 1830s, with Gothic and Rococo revivals, leading to the eclecticism of the French Second Empire. Art Nouveau provided one form of reaction to the battle of the historicist styles, and Modernism marked a more rigorous break with the past. Art Deco offered a decorative version of Modernism.\n\nSince the Second World War, the manufacture of furniture in France, devolved from the prominence of the capital itself, has been part of the increasingly international world of industrial design.\n\nFor a selection of outstanding Parisian ebénistes: see Ébéniste.\n\n\n\n"}

The festival is organised and presented by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).\n\ni Light Marina Bay was first held in 2010 and the festival was officiated by Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean on 15 October 2010. Following its success, a second edition was held in 2012 and a third edition was held in 2014. The 2016 festival, themed \"In Praise of Shadows\" (named after an essay by Junichiro Tanizaki), takes place from 4 to 27 March. The event now takes place annually.\n\nThe ‘i’ in the name alludes to the festival’s innovative content, the intelligent use of lighting as well as its international line-up of creative talent. It is also an invitation to everyone to get involved in this free outdoor celebration of creativity in a new community space.\n\nThe fifth edition of Asia’s leading sustainable light art festival, held from 3 to 26 March 2017, promises an experience not to be missed with the introduction of three complementary festival hubs, as well as community partners coming on board to champion the festival’s sustainability cause in different ways.\n\nThis year, artists from nine countries, including Singapore, are presenting sustainable light art installations anchored on the theme ‘Light & Nature’. Created with environmentally-friendly materials or energy-saving lighting, the installations highlight the importance of sustainability and reinforce Marina Bay’s position as a sustainable precinct.\n\nThe fourth edition of i Light Marina Bay, held from 4 to 27 March 2016, featured 25 innovative and environmentally sustainable light art installations by creative talents from around the world, including Japan, Latvia, Malaysia, Norway, United Kingdom and the USA. Beyond its spectacular showcase of visual art and urban space, the festival also offers a dynamic line-up of events and programmes over four weekends.\n\nThe 2016 theme, “In Praise of Shadows”, challenges the obsession that brighter is better and seeks to reframe perceptions of light and sustainability. The festival invites artists and visitors to re-imagine and reconsider sustainability issues in a new light, and to contemplate upon larger issues of light, beauty and the city in relation to the bigger community.\n\nThe curatorial direction was driven by Randy Chan, Principal Architect at Zarch Collaboratives, Singapore and Khairuddin Hori, Deputy Director of Artistic Programming at the Palais de Tokyo, Paris.\n\n\nA packed line-up of events takes place throughout the festival period - F&B offerings from PasarBella Goes to Town, Harry's and Häagen-Dazs pop-up stores and food trucks; live music from Sing Jazz as well as local up and coming artistes; bazaars by TGIF Bazaars and Megafash; arts related seminars, yoga and lifestyle events, family and community activities, and more.\n\nA one-for-one exchange campaign of used incandescent bulbs for energy efficient LED light bulbs was run at i Light Marina Bay 2016. In addition, in collaboration with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) – the installations at i Light Marina Bay will be turned off from 8:30pm to 9:30pm on 19 March 2016 as a pledge of commitment to Earth Hour.\n\nThe \"Switch Off, Turn Up\" Campaign held since the inception of i Light Marina Bay garnered a greater response from buildings around Marina Bay and beyond, with key developments involved including Marina Bay Sands and Marina Bay Financial Centres.\n\nThe third edition of i Light Marina Bay, themed Light+HeART, returned to Marina Bay from 7 March to 30 March 2014.\n\nIn line with the theme, the festival showcased 28 innovative and environmentally sustainable light installations from around the world, transforming the Marina Bay waterfront into a magical space of light and color for the public to celebrate both public spaces and creativity. To promote an environmentally-responsible behavior for a sustainable future, participating artists have incorporated the use of recyclable materials and adopted energy-efficient lighting in the creation of their stunning light art installations.\n\nThe theme Light+HeART seeks to convey the message that “in the heart of the sustainability matters, is the matter of the heart”. Through this edition, the festival hopes to create unique, happy and heart-felt installations to delight the audience while driving home the sustainability message. This edition also saw a greater number of collaborations with the community and schools to form some of the art installations such as The Wishing! Tree and #WEHEARTLIGHT.\n\ni Light Marina Bay 2014 attracted a total of 685,000 local and international visitors over the course of the three-week period.\n\nThe festival was curated by ONG&ONG’s:\n\nWhile art and sustainability take centre stage, i Light Marina Bay 2014 also featured a full array of complementary events and activities, such as free guided tours, educational talks and seminars, sporting activities, bazaars and culinary treats, to create a dazzling, diverse and more enriching experience for all.\n\nA key objective of i Light Marina Bay was to advocate environmentally-responsible behaviour for a sustainable future, and to promote Marina Bay as a culturally vibrant and sustainable urban waterfront precinct. From encouraging artists to use recyclable materials as well as adopt energy-efficient lighting technology in the creation of their light art installations, to working with event and programme partners to more effectively manage resources and minimise waste, sustainability was promoted through all aspects of the festival.\n\ni Light Marina Bay once again conducted the “Switch Off, Turn Up” Campaign, where stakeholders around Marina Bay were invited to switch off non-essential lighting and turn up air conditioning temperatures whenever possible during the festival period. The energy saving campaign was designed to offset the energy used by the light art installations and associated power use in Asia’s only sustainable light art festival which ran from 7 to 30 March.\n\n52 buildings committed in this third edition to put in place measures to save energy during the festival period. Key developments involved include Marina Bay Sands, Marina Bay Financial Centre, and One Fullerton. Their participation signified their commitment to play a part in working towards a more sustainable future together. The campaign in 2014 achieved energy savings of 268,890 kWh.\n\nThe second edition of the light festival, Light Meets Asia, returned in 2012 and ran from 9 March 2012 to 1 April 2012.\n\nIn line with the theme, the festival showcased 31 innovative and environmentally sustainable light installations by multidisciplinary artists, with strong focus on works from Asian artists. 11 of the works were by Singaporeans and 12 were from regional artists.\n\nThis year’s festival attracted a total of 565,000 local and international visitors over the three-week period.\n\nThe theme for i Light Marina Bay 2012 was Lights Meet Asia. The list of installations featured a strong representation from new, emerging and well-known light art artists from countries across Asia including China, Philippines, Japan and Singapore.\n\nThe festival is curated by:\n\nA series of fringe activities was arranged throughout the duration of the festival. These included free guided tours, performances, workshops and competitions.\n\nFringe activities comprised activities such as a weekly weekend Night carnival, with booths selling food and drinks as well as eco-friendly merchandise. The highlight of the Night Carnival was a light painting activity – which involved moving hand-held lights through the air to spell words or sketch symbols that was then captured by using long exposure on a camera.\n\nThere were also roving performances of Samba, Rata and Reggae beats by Junk Jam, LED light twirlers, towering LED stilt walkers as well as synchronised kite flying. A photography competition and Low Light Photography Workshop was also held. The festival also included an i Light Symposium where curators, artists and lighting designers had the opportunity to exchange ideas on light culture and architecture.\n\nA key objective of i Light Marina Bay was to advocate environmentally-responsible behaviour for a sustainable future, and to promote Marina Bay as a culturally vibrant and sustainable urban waterfront precinct. From encouraging artists to use recyclable materials as well as adopt energy-efficient lighting technology in the creation of their light art installations, to working with event and programme partners to more effectively manage resources and minimise waste, sustainability was promoted through all aspects of the festival.\n\nIn 2012, the initiative successfully extended its reach well beyond the Marina Bay precinct, with buildings across the island pledging their support. The campaign saved more than 200,000 kWh, four times the energy saved in 2010. This equates to 100 tonnes of CO2 equivalent, enough to generate electricity for 762 4-bedroom HDB flats for three-weeks.\n\n47 properties that participated 2012’s Switch Off, Turn Up campaign, up from 16 properties in 2010:\n\nThe inaugural edition of the festival was first held from 15 October to 7 November in 2010 and was originally part of Marina Bay Invitations 2010, a series of events planned to promote Marina Bay as a vibrant venue and a destination for a brand new live-work-play experience.\n\nIt showcased about 25 dynamic light art installations and sculptures as well as interactive and performance-based art displays by 14 artists from Singapore and 20 international artists. The artworks were arranged in a line around the Marina Bay waterfront promenade to form a Light Walk.\n\nThe key highlight of the Light Walk was an installation that consisted of 29 large and beautiful light artworks of My Public Garden by French light art group, TILT, depicting a whimsical, fantasy garden which adorned The Promontory@Marina Bay.\n\nThe inaugural festival was a success and was attended by more than 433,000 visitors over the three-week duration, of which approximately 71,031 were international visitors.\n\nCurated along the theme \"People, Place and Time\", it served as the regional platform for the exchange of ideas and technology, artistic expression and public engagement through light art works with intelligent light usage and sustainable use of energy.\n\nThe festival is curated by:\n\nFringe activities are the i Light Marina Bay Walking Tours, Smart Light Symposium: Light Art – the making of a movement, Guerilla Light Student Workshop, a photography competition and Passion Fun Around the Bay.\n\n\nArtists that participated in i Light Marina Bay 2012’s light show were selected for the use of energy-efficient LED lights and/or the incorporation of sustainable, recycle and/or re-usable materials into their light artworks. Some of these artworks leveraged on alternative sources of energy such as solar, kinetic or wind in order to generate energy for the light installations.\n\nProfessional sustainability consultants were also engaged to work with the event partners, artists, contractors and suppliers to ensure that suitable sustainable practices are incorporated to reduce energy use. Through the use of energy-efficient lighting and alternative sustainable energy sources, the total energy usage for all the installations in the 2012 i Light Marina Bay festival was less than 7,000 kWh.\n\nThe festival also participated in Earth Hour on 31 March 2012 and all 31 featured artworks were switched off for an hour.\n\nThe Switch Off, Turn Up campaign – an energy efficiency initiative – was first held in 2010 in line with the i Light Marina Bay 2010 festival. This campaign called for participating properties to make a conscious effort to switch off all non-essential indoor/outdoor lighting and office equipment and turn up air-conditioning temperatures to 24 to 25 °C.\n"}

It is a loose adaptation of William Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\".\n\nThe film ranked number 48 on \"Entertainment Weekly\"'s list of the \"50 Best High School Movies\".\n\nTerri Griffith is an aspiring teenage journalist in Phoenix who feels that her teachers don't take her articles seriously because of her good looks. After failing to get her dream job as a newspaper intern, she comes to the conclusion that it is because she is a girl.\n\nWith her parents out of town on a two-week Caribbean vacation, Terri decides to remedy the situation. Enrolling at a rival high school, she enlists the help of her little brother, Buddy, and her best friend Denise to disguise herself as a boy.

After helping him through an image makeover and encouraging him to start talking to girls, Terri starts to fall for him.\n\nAfter many episodes in and out of school, including fending off a group of bullies led by bodybuilder Greg Tolan, dealing with her real college boyfriend Kevin and being set up on a blind date with a potential new girlfriend named Sandy, Terri manages to be accepted as \"one of the guys\".

To prove otherwise, Terri opens her shirt and reveals her breasts to Rick. Although she admits to loving him, Rick rejects her, prompting a desperate Terri to kiss him in front of everyone. To placate the awestruck students, Rick derisively announces that Terri \"has tits\" before leaving the prom and Terri behind.\n\nHeartbroken and humiliated, Terri retreats to her room and writes a long article on what it is like to be a girl in boy's clothing, detailing all of her experiences, both good and bad.\n\nTerri returns to her own school.

Nevertheless, she still finds herself yearning for Rick, who has not spoken to her since the prom. One day during the summer, Rick suddenly turns up after reading her article. Realizing their true feelings for each other, they reconcile and make plans for another date. They decide to go for a drive in Terri's car, but before Buddy can join them, an attractive blonde on a motorcycle rides up and beckons to him with a smile.

Beginning with the third generation, the names were mainly created by starting with the second \"kanji\" of the teacher’s name, and adding another one to it (e.g. Toyokuni and his student Kunisada). However, in some cases during this stage the first kanji of the teacher's name was still used for the creation of name (e.g. Toyokuni and Toyoshige). Another, rare, variant was the use of the second \"kanji\" of the teacher’s name as the second kanji of the pupil’s name (e.g. Toyohiro and Naohiro).\n\nOccasionally the same art-name would be re-used by different, un-related artists at different times (e.g. Kunichika or Kunihisa). Equally possible was the use of homonymic names – ones which sound the same, but are written with different \"kanji\" (e.g. Hiromasa (広昌) and Hiromasa (広政)). \n\nAfter an event which left a teacher’s name unused, such as their death, retreat from artistic life, or a change in the art-name they used, the former name was often given to a preferred student. Therefore, some names continued to be used, with numbering to distinguish the various holders (e.g. Kuniteru I, II and III). Sometimes these numbers were used by the artists themselves, and sometimes they have been added much later, by people studying the field. \n\nAn especially confusing case is the sequence of holders of the name \"Toyokuni\". After Toyokuni I's death, the name initially was taken over by his student and adoptive son Toyoshige I. It was not used again until Kunisada I started using it in 1844. Kunisada I actually styled himself 'Toyokuni II', ignoring the fact that Toyoshige had already been the second user of the name; he is now uniformly known as 'Toyokuni III', however. His prior art-name, Kunisada, he gave to his son-in-law and adoptive son Kunimasa III, who became now Kunisada II from 1850 onwards. After Kunisada I's death, from about 1870 onwards Kunisada II called himself Toyokuni III (although we now label him Toyokuni IV – the numbering clash caused by Kunisada I's adoption of the name \"Toyokuni II\" continued to cause confusion), and he handed over the name Kunisada to Kunimasa IV (who thus became Kunisada III). The latter never used the name Toyokuni (although it sometimes alleged that he did so). The literature now indicates the following consecutive holders of these names (with the names they used given in sequence for each one, and using modern numbering for the users of the name \"Toyokuni\"): \n\n\nSome names used by Utagawa-school artists were also used by artists from other schools (e.g. Toyonobu, Shigenobu, Kunihiro e.a.), so the art-name alone is not sufficient for identification; the school name has to be added for an exact designation.\n\nFounder: Utagawa Toyoharu I (歌川 豊春; 1735–1814) \n\nThe left column contains the names of Toyoharu I's students; below and to the right are the names of their students. This pattern is repeated in turn, for their students. For example, Toyohiro in the first column is the teacher of the artists Hirochika through Toyokuma in the second column, and Hiroshige I in the second column is the teacher of the artists Hirokage through Shigeyoshi in the third column; etc.\n\nIf known, lifetime dates are given; if those are not known, the period of artistic activity is given. No data will indicate that the names are listed in literature but no datable artwork has yet been found.\n\nThe list also includes the names of several female artists; their names are specially marked. In general they were daughters who were taught to draw by their fathers, and were occasionally allowed to design cartouche images for their fathers' works, which they then signed with her own names. \n\nThis list is not totally complete: artists of the fifth generation are only partially listed, and artists of the sixth generation are omitted entirely. \n\nAbout half of the listed names cannot be found in Western literature; the list originates from a Japanese Internet-based project, the \"Ukiyo-e-shi sōran\" (浮世絵師総覧, 'Comprehensive Bibliography of Ukiyo-e Artists').\n\n"}

She also directed an adaptation of Jim Thompson's \"The Kill-Off\" featuring an ensemble cast that included Cathy Haase and the film debut of Jorja Fox.\n\nGreenwald’s first feature film, \"Home Remedy\" (1987), from her original screenplay, premiered at the Munich Film Festival before screening at the London and Torino Film Festivals, and opening at the prestigious Film Forum in New York.\n\nThe next film she directed was \"The Kill-Off\" (1990), which she adapted from Jim Thompson’s noir novel of the same name. Acquired by Channel 4 in Britain, and released theatrically by Palace Filmed Entertainment, the film also appeared at film festivals around the world, including: Sundance (in Dramatic Competition), Munich (opening night, American Independent section), London, Florence, Deauville, Toronto and Edinburgh, before winning the Best Director Award at the Torino Film Festival before its release in the US. The film is listed in the BFI (British Film Institute) Screen Guides as one of the 100 best American Independent Films. It established Greenwald’s as a significant independent filmmaking voice.\n\nGreenwald went on to write and direct her groundbreaking Western, \"The Ballad of Little Jo\" (1993), which was released worldwide by Fine Line Features and Polygram Filmed Entertainment. Star Suzy Amis was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award while co-star David Chung won the award for Best Supporting Actor. A great deal has been written about the film by scholars of the Western who consider \"The Ballad of Little Jo\" a landmark revisionist film within the genre. The film is also one of the primary subjects of Modleski’s \"Old Wives Tales and Other Women’s Stories\", which explores “the phenomenon of female authors and performers who ‘cross-dress’ - women, that is, who are moving into male genres and staking out territory declared off-limits by men and by many feminists.”\n\nSubsequently, Greenwald wrote and directed \"Songcatcher\" (2000). An unconventional, naturalistic musical, the film premiered in Dramatic Competition at the Sundance Film Festival, where it garnered a Special Jury Award for Ensemble Performance. The film received the first Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Feature Film Prize, Deauville Film Festival Audience Award, two Independent Spirit Award nominations (for actors Emmy Rossum and Pat Carroll) and a GLAAD Award nomination.\n\nGreenwald’s most recent film, \"Sophie and the Rising Sun\" (2016), is based on the novel by Augusta Trobaugh. She adapted, produced and directed the film, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival 2016, Salt Lake City Gala World Premiere.\n\nThroughout her career, Greenwald has shifted back and forth between directing feature films and directing television. Her numerous TV movies include \"What Makes a Family\", starring Brooke Shields, Whoopi Goldberg, and Cherry Jones. It was produced by Barbara Streisand and Whoopi Goldberg, with Academy Award winning producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron. The Lifetime Television Channel movie went on to win a prestigious GLAAD Award for Outstanding Television Movie and a Humanitas Award. Other TV movies include \"Get A Clue\", starring Lindsay Lohan, \"Tempted\" starring Virginia Madsen, \"Comfort and Joy\"\",\" Lifetime Television’s Christmas standard, and \"Good Morning, Killer,\" starring Catherine Bell, based on April Smith’s Ana Grey novel.\n\nRecent television episodic work includes Episode 15, Season 3, of \"Madam Secretary\", titled “Break in Democracy,” which aired on March 12, 2017 on CBS in the US, and was banned in the Philippines for its controversial depiction of a fictional Filipino President. Her episode of \"Nashville\" will air during the show’s fifth season on CMT in 2017.\n\nEarlier forays in directing for episodic television expanded Greenwald’s work to include children’s television. For Nickelodeon she directed several episodes of \"The Adventures of Pete and Pete\", created the look of the show \"The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo\", for which she directed six episodes over two seasons. She also directed the non-air pilot for a show that evolved into \"Backyardigans\" and an episode of \"Wildfire\" for ABC Family (now Freeform).\n\nGreenwald was formerly married to composer-musician David Mansfield, who scored many of her films (1994-2017). They have two daughters, Maisie (born 1997) and Lulu (born 2000).\n\nHer siblings include author Alison Leslie Gold, poet Ted Greenwal and garden designer Nancy Greenwald.\n\nGreenwald has taught film directing and screenwriting at Sarah Lawrence College, Columbia University Graduate School of the Arts, and NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts.\n\n\"Sophie and the Rising Sun\" (2017): Sundance Film Festival Salt Lake City Gala Film, Charleston Film Festival, Stockholm Film Festival, Munich Film Festival, Santa Fe Film Festival (Best Director Award), São Paulo Film Festival, among others.

{"id": "50922806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50922806", "title": "Matal v. Tam", "text": "Matal v. Tam\n\nMatal v. Tam, 582 U.S. ___ (2017) (previously known as Lee v. Tam), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court affirmed unanimously the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that the provisions of the Lanham Act's prohibiting the registration of trademarks that may \"disparage\" persons, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols with the United States Patent and Trademark Office violated the First Amendment.\n\nBefore the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington D.C., the case was titled \"In Re Tam\". This case was heard on appeal after Simon Tam applied for a trademark registration on the mark \"The Slants\" for his band from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) and was denied. The PTO interpreted the likely meaning of \"The Slants\" as a term to refer to people of Asian descent, despite claims from the band that the actual meaning referred to their perspective and that they were repurposing the term from an offensive slur. The PTO used anecdotal sources like Urban Dictionary to support their claims, while ignoring survey data, linguistics experts, and legal declarations from Asian American community leaders. The opinion was heard en banc by the Federal Circuit and the majority, which was written by Circuit Judge Moore, determined that the Disparaging Provision () of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional and found that Simon Tam was entitled to trademark registration. Tam was represented by John C. Connell of Archer & Greiner and Ron Coleman and Joel MacMull, now of Mandelbaum Salsburg.\n\nThe United States government petitioned the United States Supreme Court for writ of certiorari, which was granted in September 2016. In addition to this case, there was another case before the Fourth Circuit, \"Pro-Football, Inc. v. Blackhorse\", 112 F. Supp. 3d 439 (E.D. Va. 2015) to decide the same issue of whether or not the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional. Despite an attempt by Pro Football to merge the two cases, the Supreme Court refused to grant the motion. \n\nSection 2(a)'s ban on the federal registration of \"immoral\" or \"scandalous\" marks originated in the trademark legislation of the Lanham Act. A disparaging mark is a mark which \"dishonors by comparison with what is inferior, slights, deprecates, degrades, or affects or injures by unjust comparison.\"\n\nSimon Tam is the founder and bassist for the Asian-American dance-rock band The Slants. Tam named his band The Slants to \"reclaim\" and \"take ownership\" of Asian stereotypes. On March 5, 2010, Tam filed his first application to register THE SLANTS. After several appeals, the application was eventually abandoned. On November 14, 2011, Tam filed his second application (App. No. 85/472,044) seeking to register the mark THE SLANTS for \"Entertainment in the nature of live performances by a musical band,\" based on his use of the mark since 2006. The examiner refused to register Tam's mark, finding it likely disparaging to \"persons of Asian descent\" under § 2(a). The examiner found that the mark likely referred to people of Asian descent in a disparaging way, explaining that the term \"slants\" had \"a long history of being used to deride and mock a physical feature\" of people of Asian descent. The examiner found that a substantial composite of persons of Asian descent might find the term offensive precisely because it was being used by an Asian American band, saying: “Here, the evidence is uncontested that applicant is a founding member of a band that is self described as being composed of members of Asian descent...Thus, the association of the term SLANTS with those of Asian descent is evidenced by how the applicant uses the work - as the name of an all Asian-American band.”\n\nDue to this determination, Tam decided to appeal before the Federal Circuit.\n\nNo trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others shall be refused registration on the principal register on account of its nature unless it—<br><br>(a) Consists of or comprises immoral, deceptive, or scandalous matter; or matter which may disparage or falsely suggest a connection with persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into contempt, or disrepute; or a geographical indication which, when used on or in connection with wines or spirits, identifies a place other than the origin of the goods and is first used on or in connection with wines or spirits by the applicant on or after one year after the date on which the WTO Agreement (as defined in section 3501(9) of title 19) enters into force with respect to the United States.\n\nViewpoint discrimination occurs when the government is not only banning certain content or topics, but certain ideas. The test for viewpoint discrimination is “[o]ther things being equal, viewpoint discrimination occurs when government allows one message while prohibiting the messages of those who can reasonably be expected to respond.” Additionally, viewpoint discrimination involves intent to discourage one viewpoint and advance another. The general concern being that the government will try to eradicate, not just content from the marketplace, but certain viewpoints—whether positive or negative. If something rises to the level of viewpoint-based discrimination, it is deemed to be unconstitutional.\n\nIn \"Reed v. Town of Gilbert\", the court said that, “Government regulation of speech is content based if a law applies to particular speech because of the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed.” The Court further determined that, “This commonsense meaning of the phrase ‘content based’ requires a court to consider whether a regulation of speech ‘on its face’ draws distinctions based on the message a speaker conveys.” For that reason, content-based discrimination is presumptively invalid and if something is found to be discriminating on the basis of content, it must survive strict scrutiny.\n\nAccording to Nat’l Assoc. of Mfrs. v. Taylor: “[t]o satisfy strict scrutiny, the government must establish three elements: (1) \"the interests the government proffers in support\" of the statute must be \"properly characterized as 'compelling'\"; (2) the statute must \"effectively advance [] those interests\"; and (3) the statute must be \"narrowly tailored to advance the compelling interests asserted.\"\n\nFor \"Central Hudson\" to apply, the court would have to determine that the statute at issue deals with commercial speech. From \"Central Hudson\", the Supreme Court developed a four-part test to determine whether a statute should pass muster. The test looks to see: (1) Whether the expression is protected by the First Amendment—for it to fall here, it must concern lawful activity and not be misleading; (2) whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial; (3) whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted; and (4) whether the regulation is no more extensive than necessary to serve that interest—there must be a “reasonable fit” between the government's ends and the means of achieving those ends.\n\nIn order for something to be classified as government speech, the court looks at four factors: (1) the central purpose of the program in which the speech in question occurs; (2) the degree of editorial control exercised by the government or private entities over the content of the speech; (3) the identity of the literal speaker; and (4) whether the government or the private entity bears the ultimate responsibility for the content of the speech.\n\nThe central issue before the Federal Circuit was to determine whether or not the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional and should therefore be voided. Under the case name \"In Re Tam\", 808 F.3d 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2015), Circuit Judge Moore decided that the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional for various reasons and that Tam should be granted trademark protection on THE SLANTS.\n\nThe court determined that the Lanham Act was viewpoint-based discriminatory because whenever the government chooses to deny trademark protection to a mark, it is doing so because of the message the mark conveys. The government tried to defend their position before the Federal Circuit by saying that they should be able to deny protection to the most \"vile\" racial epithets and images; however, the Federal Circuit said that \"When the government discriminates against speech because it disapproves of the message conveyed by the speech, it discriminates on the basis of viewpoint.\" The Federal Circuit bolstered their stance that it is viewpoint discriminatory because the PTO refused to register \"The Slants\"; however, the PTO has registered marks such as \"Celebrasians\" and \"Asian Efficiency\". The Federal Circuit found the only difference between marks such as \"The Slants\" versus \"Celebrasians\" and \"Asian Efficiency\" is the messages conveyed. The Slants could be seen as being derogatory towards those of Asian descent versus positive. Since the court determined that the disparaging provision is viewpoint discriminatory, then it is immediately unconstitutional.\n\nIn the alternative, the Federal Circuit determined that the disparaging provision is content-based discriminatory, in addition to viewpoint-discriminatory. Additionally, the Federal Circuit came to the determination that even though trademarks inherently deal more with commercial speech versus expressive speech, that when the government cancels a mark under the disparaging provision, it is affecting more of the expressive aspects of speech and not the commerciality of it. Therefore, the Federal Circuit found that if the disparaging provision is not found to be viewpoint discriminatory (in light of a higher court potentially overturning parts of this case) that it must be content-based discriminatory and must survive strict scrutiny unless an exception applied.\n\nThe government raised the argument that the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act should be reviewed under intermediate scrutiny by way of the \"Central Hudson\" test, because the inherent nature of trademarks are commercial. However, the Federal Circuit determined that when the PTO chooses to cancel trademarks under the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act, it is usually because of their expressive components and not their commercial components. The Federal Circuit went on to say that commercial speech mixed with expressive speech should be treated as expressive under deciding whether to apply strict or intermediate scrutiny. Therefore, the Federal Circuit decided that strict scrutiny should be applied.\n\nIn the Federal Circuit's effort to show the unconstitutionality of the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act, they chose to analyze the provision under the \"Central Hudson\" intermediate scrutiny. The part of the \"Central Hudson\" test that the Federal Circuit failed the Lanham Act on was the \"legitimate Interest\" element (See above).\n\nFor this element, the government raised three arguments for why they had a legitimate interest:\n\nThe Federal Circuit determined that none of the arguments raised by the government created a legitimate enough interest to pass the \"Central Hudson\" test. Since it does not pass the \"Central Hudson\" test, the Federal Circuit determined that it would also not pass strict scrutiny, since strict scrutiny requires a statute to rise to a higher standard.\n\nThe Government raised the argument that the Lanham Act should be classified as a Government Subsidy and therefore exempt from the strict scrutiny requirement. The Federal Circuit ultimately determined that no taxpayer dollars are used in registering trademarks, that it is completely user-funded in their application fees; therefore, the Federal Circuit determined that this does not fall under the government subsidy exception to strict scrutiny.\n\nThe Government also raised the argument that the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is government speech and should therefore fall outside of the purview of the first amendment. The government argues this because of the ability to place the \"®\" or \"TM\" on the registered mark. The government found this argument to be without merit. The Federal Circuit said that the only message the government conveys when a mark is registered with the PTO is that \"a mark is registered.\" The court cited many reasons for their determination, but, most prominently, was a policy consideration. The Court was concerned that if they allowed this argument to win the day, then it would also affect other areas of law, such as Copyright and Patent law. The general concern being that the government could then control what they would and would not grant protections to and would therefore affect the types of speech expressed; this would have the effect of abridging free speech, which is a violation of the first amendment.\n\nIn addition to agreeing with Circuit Judge Moore's opinion, Judge O'Malley added that she believes the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional under the vagueness doctrine too.\n\nCircuit Judge Dyk generally agrees with the opinion of the majority in that the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional; however, in his view, the majority err in going \"beyond the facts of this case and holding the statute facially unconstitutional as applied to purely commercial speech.\" Judge Dyk also believed that many trademarks lack expressive characteristics that would merit First Amendment protection and therefore the analysis should be under the \"Central Hudson\" test and not strict scrutiny.\n\nJudge Lourie disagreed with the majority in many ways outlined below:\n\nJudge Reyna disagreed with the majority in the sense that trademark are exclusively commercial speech and should therefore be analyzed under the \"Central Hudson\" test and intermediate scrutiny. From here, Judge Reyna determined that the government does have a legitimate interest in promoting the orderly flow of commerce and therefore, should pass intermediate scrutiny. Judge Reyna stated that when you balance the legitimate interest of the disparaging provision versus how narrowly tailored the statute is, that it makes sense that the Lanham Act should survive scrutiny.\n\nThe United States Patent and Trademark Office appealed the decision to the United States Supreme Court, presenting the following question in its petition for certiorari: \"whether the disparagement provision in 15 U.S.C. 1052(a) is facially invalid under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment\"? The Supreme Court agreed to grant certiorari in September 2016. Oral arguments were heard on January 18, 2017. \n\nOn June 19, 2017 the Supreme Court delivered judgment in favor of Tam, voting unanimously to affirm the lower court. The majority opinion stated \"The disparagement clause violates the First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause. Contrary to the Government’s contention, trademarks are private, not government speech.\"\n\nThis decision is another ruling that strikes down 'Hate Speech' laws that violate the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause. Justice Samuel Alito writes in this unanimous decision:Speech that demeans on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, age, disability, or any other similar ground is hateful; but the proudest boast of our free speech jurisprudence is that we protect the freedom to express “the thought that we hate.” \"United States \"v. \"Schwimmer\", 279 U. S. 644, 655 (1929) (Holmes, J., dissenting).Justice Neil Gorsuch was not yet a member of the court during the oral argument, so he did not participate in the decision.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17462544", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17462544", "title": "Melun Diptych", "text": "Melun Diptych\n\nThe Melun Diptych is a two-panel oil painting by the French court painter Jean Fouquet (1425–1480) created around 1452. The name of the diptych came from its original home in the Collegiate Church of Notre-Dame in Melun. The left panel depicts Etienne Chevalier with his patron saint St. Stephen and the right panel depicts the Virgin and Christ child surrounded by cherubim. Each wooden panel measures about 93 by 85 centimeters and the two would have been hinged together at the center. The two pieces, originally a diptych, are now separated. The left panel now resides in the Staatliche Museen in Berlin and the right panel is now located at the Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp, Belgium. A self-portrait medallion is also associated with the two panels. Measuring 6 centimeters in diameter, it would have adorned the frame, and consists of copper, enamel, and gold. The medallion is now located in the Louvre in Paris, France.\n\n \n\nOn the left Étienne Chevalier, the treasurer to King Charles VII of France, kneels in a red robe with in his hand in a position of prayer. The king liked to have non-aristocrats such as Chevalier about him because he thought them more reliable than nobles. On his right is Chevalier's patron saint, St. Stephen, in a dark deacon's robes with gold trim. His right arm is draped across Chevalier's shoulder while his left hand holds a book and a jagged rock, his representational attribute as he was stoned to death. Both men gaze off to the right as if they were looking at the Virgin and child on the other panel. The wall behind the treasurer and his patron saint is inlaid with marble panels and has elaborate white and gold moldings. The tiled floor's neutral colors create a stark contrast with the saturated colors of the men's robes. Identifying Chevalier is an engraving on the wall behind him that says \"IER ESTIEN\". This lettering has been used to link the painting to Fouquet since he never signed any of his work. It is very similar to lettering used in several miniatures which are attributed to him.\n\nSeated on an elaborate gold throne, the Madonna and the Christ child are depicted in the right panel. The Madonna wears a blue dress, white mantle and a jewel-encrusted crown. On her lap sits the child, who makes a pointing gesture to the left with His left hand at the patron and the saint. The two are surrounded by blue and red cherubim, which greatly contrast with the pale skin of the Virgin and child. Although the figures are modeled realistically, the mood is otherworldly, described by historian Roger Fry as a dreamlike state of sentimentalism. The Madonna is depicted here as the Queen of Heaven and is meant to reveal her as between the veil of heaven and earth. She is both human and otherworldly. The unnatural colors have been attributed to represent the heraldic colors of the king, being red, white, and blue.\n\nThe original frame was covered in blue velvet with silver and gold embroidery, antique love knots, and pearls. It also included a self-portrait medallion of Jean Fouquet. Fouquet is shown frontally, his gold image is engraved into the black enamel background and framed by his name. It is believed that he invented this technique. The original position of the diptych high above the tomb would have made it difficult to see the tiny medallion and since the pieces have since been separated, its exact position on the frame is unclear. The medallion was Fouquet's way of signing the diptych. It is traditionally recognized as the oldest self-signed self-portrait and is Fouquet's only signed work.\n\nMuch information about Fouquet's life is obscure. The artist was born in 1420 in Tours, France. He traveled to Rome in 1446 for two years as part of a French delegation. Fouquet was employed by Charles VII and Louis XI and was called \"peintre du roi\" meaning painter to the king. He was called upon to create portraits, manuscript illuminations, altarpieces, ephemeral decorations, and sculptural designs. He is believed to have traveled to Florence and Venice where he studied the work of contemporary Italian masters. This influence can be seen in the Melun Diptych as it has been suggested that the background of the left panel is an Italian courtyard in empirical perspective, not unlike Jacopo Bellini's method. In contrast to the Madonna and child panel, which lacks perspective completely, the background behind Chevalier and St. Stephen extends deep into space in a truly Italian style. The figures are also clear and modeled realistically in the Italian style as opposed to his native French. In the case of the right panel, the figures are so smooth they appear to be polished. This effect enhances the otherworldly aspects of this panel, in contrast to the very realistic rendering of the left panel. Etienne Chevalier commissioned the Melun Diptych to hang over his wife's tomb. Chevalier had a close relationship with Fouquet and was his main patron during his time as treasurer to the king. The diptych was hung above Catharine Bude's tomb. This has caused controversy over whether a third panel is now lost. Some scholars believe it may have formed part of a triptych of which the third panel would have depicted Chevalier's wife since it was meant to be hung above her tomb. This could have tied the two different existing panels into a more cohesive piece. Others believe this is not the case. A report from Denys Godefroy who saw the piece in its original context in 1660, and is therefore the most reputable source available today, does not describe a third panel.\n\nUntil 1775, the diptych remained in the church of Notre Dame in Melun. In need of funds for restoration, the cathedral chapter decided to sell the panels. The right panel was purchased by the mayor of Antwerp and has remained in the city since 1840. The left panel was purchased by Clemens Brentano, a German poet, and joined his collection in 1896. The halves have been reunited twice since their separation, the first time in 1904 when France borrowed the panels from Berlin for an exhibition of French primitives and the second time in 2017, for the Jean Fouquet exhibition at Gemäldegalerie in Berlin.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6482537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6482537", "title": "Newington Butts Theatre", "text": "Newington Butts Theatre\n\nThe Newington Butts Theatre was one of the earliest Elizabethan theatres, possibly predating even The Theatre of 1576 and the Curtain Theatre, which are usually regarded as the first dedicated playhouses in London. William Ingram believes it was probably the first of the three to begin construction, and may have been the first completed.\n\nThe Mayor and Corporation of London banned plays in 1572 as a measure against the plague, and in 1575 they formally expelled all players from the city. This prompted the construction of playhouses outside the jurisdiction of London, in the liberties of Halliwell (in Shoreditch) and later the Clink, and at Newington near the established entertainment district of St. George's Fields. The Newington theatre was located not on Newington Butts but on the east side of Walworth Road near the junction with New Kent Road. The playhouse stood less than an acre of land in Lurklane, occupying of frontage on what became Walworth Road and bounded to the south by a drainage ditch (or \"sewer\" in the language of the time). Ingram uses Commissions of Sewers records of 1576–1578 to deduce that the actor Jerome Savage lived adjacent to the sewer and thus the playhouse was in the northern part of the plot. The Reliance Building used to occupy the site; it is now under the southern roundabout of the Elephant and Castle junction.\n\nLurklane was out of leased in 1566 from the Dean and Chapter of Canterbury Cathedral by Richard Hick(e)s. Hicks was a grocer and member of the royal retinue, sometimes described as a \"yeoman of the guard\". Hicks sublet Lurklane to Jerome Savage on or about Lady Day (25 March) 1576, some three weeks before the lease was signed for The Theatre in Shoreditch. However, soon after the 1576 lease was signed, Hicks and his son-in-law Peter Hunningborne tried to rescind it. They failed to do so through the courts, but used trickery to make Savage default on his rent on Lady Day 1577. Savage appears to have stayed on the premises, and in turn sought the protection of the law as Hunningborne sought to move into Savage's residence. Hunningborne described Savage as \"a verrie lewed fealowe\" who \"liveth by noe other trade than playinge of staige plaies and Interlevdes\". However the sewer assessments indicate that Savage remained on the premises, so the lawsuit may have been withdrawn or settled out of court.\n\nWickham \"et al\" interpret these documents to mean that Hicks constructed a 'house or tenement' that someone (presumably the actor Savage) converted into a playhouse. It was clearly established by Lady Day 1577 and like the Theatre may have been in use before the winter of 1576/77, or even in 1575. Savage may have built the theatre under the patronage of the Earl of Warwick whose company of actors first performed at court on 14 February 1575. Warwick had been appointed to the Privy Council in the autumn of 1573, and the more powerful privy councillors – the earls of Sussex, Lincoln, Arundel and his younger brother Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester – were all patrons of playing companies.\n\nWarwick's company appears to have flourished for around five years, before ill-health forced him to retire to his home in Herfordshire. On 13 May 1580 the Privy Council wrote to the Surrey justices about an unknown company playing at Newington Butts despite a ban on theatre. It is known that John and Lawrence Dutton led members of Warwick's company to reform as the Earl of Oxford's players by April 1580, and Ingram speculates that it was they who were playing at their old home. Oxford was sent to the Tower of London in 1581, banished from court until 1 June 1583 and went off to war in Flanders in 1585. John Dutton left for the newly formed Queen's Men in 1583 but Oxford's Men survived the loss of their leader, being recorded in each year 1584–1587 and leaving traces of activity thereafter.\n\nA sewer record of 26 February 1591 refers to Hunningborne and the playhouse. By that time it seems to have been in decline, as more theatres sprung up closer to London. Some time in the early 1590s (and definitely before September 1593) Lord Strange's Men played three days there, but the undated Privy Council document comments on the inconvenience of its location and \"of longe tyme plaies haue not there bene vsed on working daies\". Plague closed down London's theatres for most of the period between 22 June 1592 and 14 May 1594. The impresario Philip Henslowe took the opportunity to remodel his Rose Theatre, but for some reason the Privy Council kept it closed from 16 May to 15 June 1594.\n\nAccordingly Henslowe promoted a series of plays at Newington Butts from 3–13 June 1594 with the Admiral's Men and Lord Chamberlain's Men, the two companies that had emerged from Lord Strange's men during the layoff. The nature of Henslowe's relationship with Newington Butts is uncertain, Vickers among others has suggested Henslowe owned it by this time but Wickham \"et al\" speculate that the poor profits he recorded for the season were in part due to the cost of renting the theatre. The ownership theory might be bolstered by Winifred Frazer's suggestion that the enigmatic abbreviation 'ne' used by Henslowe in his records of certain plays, conventionally taken to mean a new play, applies to a performance at Newington.\n\nThis season of plays in June 1594 is well documented, as Henslowe kept assiduous records in his \"Diary\". These include some of the earliest known performances of familiar names such as \"Hamlet\", \"Titus Andronicus\" and \"The Taming of a Shrew\" but in each case the exact relationship between the 1594 plays and those we know as Shakespeare's is uncertain and controversial among scholars. Rutter regards the \"Titus\" put on by Henslowe at the Rose in January 1594 as \"almost certainly Shakespeare's\", but it is very early for the \"Hamlet\" of the Second Quarto and First Folio, which is ascribed to around 1600. This and other evidence has led to the theory that the 1600 text is based on an earlier play, the so-called \"Ur-Hamlet\", which was written by either Thomas Kyd, Shakespeare, or someone else. This performance is the first one on record of Ur-Hamlet, although it appears to have existed since at least 1589.\n\nOn 6 July 1594 the Dean and Chapter let the playhouse site to Paul Buck, on condition that he convert the playhouse to other uses and that no more plays were performed after Michaelmas (29 September). Buck seems to have complied – there is no mention of the playhouse in the renewal of his lease on 5 April 1595, and on 5 October 1599 the Sewer Commission refers to \"the houses where the old playe house did stand att Newington\". The theatrical links lingered after the theatre was gone; a bad pun is referred to as a \"Newington conceit\" in a play of 1612 and the playwright Thomas Middleton died there and was buried at Newington Butts church on 4 July 1627.\n"}

Salavuo (2006) has examined the recent popularization of informal engagement with music technology in online social networks, which may embody a form of informal community music education. The potential of online music education to create positive change in terms of professional development has been noted by various scholars (Hebert, 2008; Sherbon & Kish, 2005); However, concerns have also been raised regarding the absence of a sufficient research base concerning the effectiveness of online music education (Hebert, 2007; Webster, 2007).

The competition was relaunched under the name PBS Kids Go! Writers Contest in 2009 as a continuation from its predecessor called Reading Rainbow Young Writers and Illustrators Contest which was started in 1995.\n\nIn 1995, the first competition was launched by the creators of Reading Rainbow children television program. The annual competition had been sponsored to compliment the Reading Rainbow program to inspire children to have a lifelong love of reading. The competition encouraged, challenged and rewarded children to write and illustrate their own picture books. The entries were submitted to the local stations for local judging. The winners at local level would then be submitted for national-level judging.\n\nAfter a few years, the number of entries that were submitted nationally had been increased to almost 40,000. The number of participants continued to increase at the peak in 2007 with more than 50,000 entries.\n\nThe future of the competition became questionable starting in 2006 when the funding for the Reading Rainbow program started to dry up. There was a new funding agreement but no new program had been produced since April 2006 when the commitment for funding of 52 new episodes did not pan out. The program was on a rerun since then by another funding source. This funding issue caused the creators to cancel the national-level competition in 2006. However, the local competitions organized by local public broadcasting stations continued. As the participants of the competition continued to grow into 2007 even without any new episode of Reading Rainbow, the WNED-TV station in Buffalo, New York which was a co-creator of the program took ownership to administrate the national-level judging. The national-level competition resumed in 2007. The Reading Rainbow rerun had finally come to an end on August 28, 2009. At that time, the level of participation in the competition was still high with 90 participating stations. With a strong call for expansion of the competition despite the cancellation of the program, the PBS headquarters arranged to have the winning entries to continue to be accessible online as they had been until December 2009.\n\nIn November 2009, PBS secured its partnership with WNED-TV to launch the competition in the same format as in prior years but with the new name as \"PBS Kids Go! Writers Contest\". They also launched a new website for the competition to update information and archive winning stories. In 2014, one year after the discontinuation of PBS Kids Go!, PBS changed the name of the Writers Contest to the \"PBS Kids Writers Contest\".\n\nChildren who are in grades K through 3 within the viewing areas of participate local stations can submit their entries to their local stations. Stories can be fact or fiction, and prose or poetry but each story must be done by single author. Stories with the illustrations done by kindergarten and first grade have word count of 50-200 words, and 100-350 words for grades 2 and 3. Each local PBS station handles local judging separately by grade levels. The first place winners from each station are sent to the national contest later in the year.\n\nWilliam Charbonneau,\nHafsa Rehmatullah,\nAlvina Singh,\nMusa Rashid,\nAli Rafi\n\n"}

{"id": "7670949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7670949", "title": "Popular print", "text": "Popular print\n\nPopular prints is a term for printed images of generally low artistic quality which were sold cheaply in Europe and later the New World from the 15th to 18th centuries, often with text as well as images. They were some of the earliest examples of mass media. After about 1800, the types and quantity of images greatly increased, but other terms are usually used to categorise them.\n\nFrom about 1400, there began a \"visual revolution that inundated Europe with images during the fifteenth century\" (Field) as the woodcut technique was applied to paper, which was now manufactured in Christian Europe, instead of being imported from Islamic Spain. In the 15th century, the great majority of these images were religious, if playing cards are excluded. They were sold at churches, fairs and places of pilgrimage. Most were coloured, usually crudely, by hand or later by stencil. One political cartoon relating to events in 1468-70 has survived in several different versions (many from years later). Old master print is a term that at this period includes popular prints, but later is restricted to more expensive and purely artistic prints. \n\nAlthough early information as to prices is almost non-existent, it is clear from a number of sources that small woodcuts were affordable by at least the urban working-class, and much of the peasant class as well.\n\nDuring the middle of the century, the quality of the images became typically very low, but there was an improvement towards the end, partly because it was necessary to keep pace with the quality of images in engravings. Engravings were always much more expensive to create, as they needed greater skill to create the plate, which would last for far fewer impressions than a woodcut. They did not come into the popular prints category until the 19th century, when different techniques made them much cheaper.\n\nBroadsheets, also known as broadsides, were a common format. They were usually single sheets of paper of various sizes, typically sold by street-vendors. Another format was the chapbook, usually a single sheet cut or folded to make a small pamphlet or book. In Spain there were \"pliego\"s, in Portugal the \"papel volante\", and in other countries other names. These covered a great variety of material, including pictures, popular history, political comment or satire, news, almanacs (from c. 1470), poems and songs. They could be very influential politically, and were often subsidized by political factions for propaganda purposes. See Broadside (music) for their musical use. The Reformation hugely increased the market for satirical and polemical prints in all counties affected. In France the Wars of Religion, and in England the English Civil War and the political convulsions after the Restoration all produced huge quantities of propaganda and polemic, in images as well as text.\n\nDespite being often issued in large numbers, their survival rate was extremely low, and they are now very rare, with most having not survived at all. This has been demonstrated by analysis of the records of the London Stationers Company from 1550 onwards; some blocks were in print for over a century with no copies now surviving. They were very commonly pasted to the walls of rooms. Paper was still sufficiently expensive that all available spare pieces tended to be used in the toilet. One of the biggest surviving collections with 439 prints is Wickiana at the Zentralbibliothek Zürich.\n\nNewspapers began in the early 17th century, as an upmarket and expensive form of broadsheet (still a term for a large-format newspaper). The first in English came in 1620. During this century books also became much cheaper, and began to replace some types of popular print. These trends continued during the next century, and although most of the traditional types of popular print lived on until the 19th century or beyond, they were by then part of a much wider print culture, and the term is generally not used of them. One type of publication continuing into the 20th century is the Brazilian \"cordel literature\" (\"string literature\" - it is hung on strings by the sellers) that continue to use woodcuts, and is part of a continuous tradition going back to the Portuguese \"papel volante\" of the 17th century. Lubok prints in Russia were another local variant.\n\nPolitical caricature prints for sale as single sheets are found as early as the 15th century, but reached the peak of their popularity in much of Europe in the 18th and early 19th century, before the form migrated into newspapers and magazines. Above all they were popular in England, where a high degree of freedom of the press meant that dedicated print-shops, often also acting as the publishers, could openly sell and display scathing images of the Royal Family and government politicians, a business that had to remain \"under the counter\" in much of Europe.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48613036", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48613036", "title": "Portuguese Romanesque architecture", "text": "Portuguese Romanesque architecture\n\nThe Romanesque style of architecture was introduced in Portugal between the end of the 11th and the beginning of the 12th century. In general, Portuguese cathedrals have a heavy, fortress-like appearance, with crenellations and few decorative elements apart from portals and windows. Portuguese Romanesque cathedrals were later extensively modified, among others the Old Cathedral of Coimbra, although it only had some minor changes.\n\nChronological and geographical distribution of Romanesque buildings in Portugal are intimately connected with the territorial organization emerging from the Reconquista, being the fundamental reason for the differences between a locally influenced artistical phenomenon in the North of the country and a more \"international\" kind in buildings like Coimbra and Lisbon Cathedrals. Romanesque architecture first developed in Minho and Douro regions (with Braga Cathedral being its reference) spreading later southwards to Coimbra. It is in the rural areas of the northwest and center regions that Romanesque buildings are more concentrated, being more dense in the margins of rivers Douro and Mondego.\n\nIt was in areas that had been recently added to Portuguese territory, thus more open to foreign influence, places where royal and ecclesiastical sponsorship were stronger, where French monastical communities settled in and foreign artists produced their works (like Coimbra and Lisbon), that we find the most artistically complete forms of Romanesque. As it expanded it became more local, mixing with earlier regional construction techniques and solutions.\n\nRomanesque building construction activity gained pace after 1095, when Count Henry took possession of the County of Portugal. Count Henry came with noblemen and Benedictine monks from the Abbey of Cluny, which was headed by Henry's brother, Hugh. The Benedictines and other religious orders ended up giving great impulse to Romanesque architecture in Portugal during the whole 12th century.\nExamples of those rural monastical and parish churches, most of them built in the 9th and 10th centuries with late High Middle Ages artistical features and before the expansion of Romanesque architecture, are the Monastery of Rates, one of the best iconographical buildings of this style in Portugal, the churches of Paço de Sousa Monastery, Santa Maria de Airães and the Monastery of São Pedro de Ferreira, among others.\n\nTheir communities first followed the Benedictine rule but were later deeply influenced by the monastical reforms in the 11th century, mainly the Cluniac, reflected in the adoption of newly Romanesque architectural features, creating some very regional and rich decorative and architectural solutions.\n\nMozarabic art refers not only to the artistic style of Mozarabs (from musta'rab meaning \"Arabized\"), Iberian Christians living in Al-Andalus who adopted some Arab customs without converting to Islam, preserving their religion and some ecclesiastical and judicial autonomy, but also to those same communities that migrated north to the Christian Kingdoms, bringing with them an architectural phenomenon in which Christian and Islamic artistic elements were fused together.\n\nAlthough Mozarabic communities maintained for the practice of their religious rites some of the Visigothic churches predating the Islamic occupation, the extent of this Visigothic artistical heritage is hard to pinpoint, as most monuments from the previous period have been lost. Nevertheless, those buildings that did survive seem to hold on tenaciously to traditions of Visigothic architecture with few, if any, Islamic features. All this includes them in the ample concept of Pre-Romanesque architecture. Besides this possible Visigothic connection, Mozarabic architecture in Portugal also came in contact with Asturian art, identified with the artistic creations that were being produced during the 9th century specifically in the territories that comprised the Kingdom of Asturias. However this artistic activity, in general (and architecture specifically) was not limited to this area or this century, it encompassed the whole northern peninsula and continued during the next century.\n\nThe most exceptional example of Mozarabic architecture in Portugal is the Church of São Pedro de Lourosa, near Coimbra. There is no doubt that this rural church was founded sometime around 912 AD (950 by the Era of Caesar, corresponds to 912 by Christian Era) according to an authentic inscription found in one of the transept arms. Despite a number of Asturian references to the church's engravings, the influences of the architectural models favoured by the Mozarabs are clearly visible in the modulation of the masonry and mainly in the decorative elements of the cornices (use of the Alfiz) and the design of horseshoe arches, typical of Mozarabic style. Its basilican type structure comprises a small transept separating the chancel from the main body of the building (called a Narthex), and a row of three surmounted arches supported by columns separating the central nave from the side aisles. During restoration works carried out in the mid-20th century, various architectural features were found that would have belonged to an earlier Visigothic church.\n\nOther examples of Mozarabic monuments in Portuguese territory are the Chapel of São Pedro de Balsemão in Lamego, the Cathedral of Idanha-a-Velha, with a more Visigothic influence but still used by the Mozarabic community of the region, the Church of São Gião, near Nazaré, and the unique apse of the old monastery of Castro de Avelãs (Bragança), that presents not only a Mozarabic flavour but also a deep fusion with Asturian-Leonese architectural features. Most scholars had identified its construction from the late 12th and early 13th centuries, although new archeological findings have challenged that date and put its origin back in the 11th century.\n\nIn Portugal, the Romanesque architecture comes in late 11th century within a wider phenomenon of European cultural and religious spreading to the Iberian Peninsula, influenced by the Cluniac monastical reforms and the arrival of the Orders of Cluny (after 1086), Cister (or Citeaux) (1144), St. Augustine (after 1131) and the Military-Religious Orders of the Knights Hospitaller (1121) and the Knights Templar (1126). The Romanesque architecture, through its prestige, relates with the rise and assertion of Portuguese independence.\n\nDeveloping itself later than witnessed in the rest of Europe, in Portugal it only gained real significance after the second quarter of the 12th century, although previous buildings of the same style already existed. Various factors contribute to this aspect, mainly the unstable environment experienced in the Iberian Peninsula at the time due to the Reconquista and the consequent political reorganisation of peninsular geography. In fact, one of the most significant aspects of Romanesque architecture in the Peninsula, but particularly in Portugal, is the noticeable connotation that we find between its spreading and land organisation and occupation. The arrival in Portugal of the religious orders mentioned above must be understood in the general context of the Reconquista. In fact, those monastical institutions received immense privileges from the Portuguese monarchs and nobility, contributing to the security of the territory, but above all, to its social organization. This Reconquista took place from North to South, resulting in the same spread of Romanesque architecture with a decreasing density to the South. Almost no Romanesque artifacts survive in Southern Portugal.\n\nThe first Romanesque churches in the North were simple constructions, consisting of a nave with a timber roof and a rectangular apse. Examples can be found at the Igreja de São Cristóvão de Rio Mau, at the Igreja de Santa Eulália do Mosteiro de Arnoso and at the Church of Fontarcada (with already a semicircular apse at the east end).\n\nExpansion of the Romanesque style coincided with the reign of D.Afonso Henriques (1139–1185), a monarch with Burgundian background being the son of Count Henry and great grandson of Robert II, King of France. During his reign Lisbon, Coimbra, Porto and Viseu Cathedrals were built and also the Augustinian Monastery of Santa Cruz, projected to be a royal pantheon. The construction began in 1131 and by 1150 the nave and its apses were already finished. Its structural shape and decorative features were a novelty in Portugal, showing that its architect was either probably French or came in contact with French Romanesque architecture from Burgundy like Tournus, Cluny, Paray-le-Monial or Romainmôtier.\n\nBeing a predominantly religious architecture, Portuguese Romanesque style was deeply related with ecclesiastical rural church parishes and monastic monasteries founded or rebuilt in the 12th and 13th centuries, with bishops, by royal mandate, their biggest sponsors.\n\nThe Cathedral of Braga was rebuilt in the 1070s by Bishop Pedro and consecrated in 1089, although only the apse was finished at the time. He wished to create a pilgrimage church, with a three aisled nave, an ambulatory and a large transept.\nWorks increased during the tenure of D.Paio Mendes as archbishop (1118–37), after King D.Afonso Henriques granted a foral chart to the city as well as generous donations for its construction. It was then resumed and lasted until the middle of the 13th century. The original 12th-century building was built in the Burgundian Romanesque style of the monastery church of Cluny and influenced many other churches and monasteries in Portugal in that period. In later times the cathedral was greatly modified, so that today it is a mix of Romanesque, Gothic, Manueline and Baroque styles.\n\nThe original Romanesque Western façade of the Cathedral has been totally suppressed, except for some archivolts and capitals of the main portal, heavily decorated with animal and human sculptured reliefs. The figures on one archivolt, with hens, foxes and a minstrel, may be telling a moralistic song like the ones from Roman de Renart, of French tradition.\n\nInside it has three aisles covered by a wooden roof, a transept and five Eastern chapels in the apse. On the north wall outside of the cathedral there is the small Chapel of São Geraldo, in memory of Geraldo of Moissac, Archbishop of Braga (1096–1108), of early Romanesque design, that may be a remnant of the late 11th-century building. This chapel was left outside of the final cathedral, perhaps due to a change of design in the 12th century. The nave is essentially Romanesque thanks to a \"purifying\" reform in the 20th century that suppressed most later additions, although some original capitals of the columns have been lost. D.Afonso, son of King D.João I, is buried in a 15th-century tomb made of bronze, which can be seen in the nave of the Cathedral.\n\nSeveral chapels were built adjacent to the cathedral in the Middle Ages. The Chapel of Kings (Capela dos Reis) was built around 1374 in the place where Count Henrique and Countess Teresa were buried. Their tombs were replaced in the early 16th century by new ones, with recumbent figures.\n\nThe Porto Cathedral, located in the historical centre of the city of Porto, is one of the city's oldest monuments and one of the most important Romanesque monuments in the country.\nThere is evidence that the city has been a bishopric seat since the Suevi domination in the 5th-6th centuries. The current building was built according to tradition around 1110 under the patronage of Bishop Hugo (1112-1136), but apparently the church is likely to have been built in the mid-12th century, after 1147, because the \"De Expugnatione Lyxbonensi\" appears to describe a small church that appears to match the old pre-Romanesque cathedral built in the 9th-10th centuries. As such, the building was likely built later, as the artistic evidence, that links the Romanesque of this church to the area of La Rochelle, supports. The church was only completed in 1557, when the Manueline lantern tower was installed.\n\nThe cathedral is flanked by two square towers, each supported with two buttresses and crowned with a cupola. The façade lacks decoration and is rather architecturally heterogeneous. It shows a Baroque porch and a beautiful Gothic wheel window under a crenellated arch, giving the impression of a fortified church.\nThe Romanesque nave is rather narrow and is covered by barrel vaulting. It is flanked by two aisles with a lower vault. The stone roof of the central aisle is supported by flying buttresses, making the building one of the first in Portugal to use this architectonic feature.\n\nThis original building has suffered some alterations (minored by the archaizing restorations of the Estado Novo between 1927 and 1945) but the general aspect of the building has remained a mix of Romanesque and Gothic.\n\nAlso to be referenced the elegant Gothic cloister, built between the 14th and the 15th centuries during the reign of King D.João I, who married English Princess Philippa of Lancaster in this cathedral in 1387.\n\nViseu Cathedral started being built in the 12th century and is the most important historical monument of the city. It is currently a mix of architectural styles, specially from the Manueline, Renaissance and Mannerist periods.\n\nThe current cathedral building started being erected in the mid-12th century, but little remains from this early Romanesque building except for some architectural details. The church was greatly enlarged in the following centuries of the Middle Ages, assuming its present configuration as a three-aisled building with three Eastern chapels. Some Gothic chapels in the cloisters also date from this period.\n\nBuilt has a three-aisled nave, transept and three Eastern chapels. The main façade is flanked by two towers. The outer, lateral walls of the church have a heavy, menacing appearance, typical of Portuguese medieval cathedrals, being partially decorated with merlons.\nThe South (clock) tower is still of medieval origin, while the North tower had to be rebuilt in the 17th century after a storm. The storm also destroyed the Manueline façade, which was rebuilt around 1635. The three-storey façade resembles a Mannerist altarpiece and is decorated with niches harbouring statues of the Four Evangelists, as well as the Holy Mary and Saint Theotonius.\n\nThe Old Cathedral of Coimbra (Portuguese: Sé Velha de Coimbra) was built some time after the Battle of Ourique in 1139. The project of this Romanesque cathedral is attributed to Master Robert, a, possibly, French architect who was directing the building of Lisbon Cathedral at that time and visited Coimbra regularly. The works were supervised by Master Bernard, possibly also French, who was succeeded by Master Soeiro, an architect active in other churches around the Diocese of Porto.\n\nFrom the outside, Coimbra's old cathedral looks like a fortress, with its high, crenellated walls harbouring few, narrow windows. This menacing appearance is explained by the belligerent times in which it was built. There is a tower-like structure in the middle of the western façade with a portal and a similar-looking upper window. Both portal and window are heavily decorated with Romanesque motifs of Mozarabic and Pre-Romanesque influences. The façade is reinforced by thick buttresses at the corners that compensate for the angle of the terrain (the cathedral was built on the slope of a hill).\nThe interior of the cathedral has a nave with two aisles, a small transept, and an eastern apse with three chapels. The nave is covered by barrel vaulting and the lateral aisles by groin vaults. The nave has an upper storey, a spacious triforium (arched gallery), that could accommodate more mass attendants in the tribunes if needed. All columns of the interior have decorated capitals, mainly with vegetable motifs, but also with animals and geometric patterns. The windows of the lantern-tower and the big window in the west facade are the main sources of natural light of the cathedral.\n\nThe cloister, built during the reign of Afonso II (early 13th century), is a work of the transition between Romanesque and Gothic. Each of the Gothic pointed arches that face the courtyard encompass two twin round arches in Romanesque style.\n\nThe Patriarchal Cathedral of St. Mary Major (Portuguese: Santa Maria Maior de Lisboa or Sé de Lisboa) or simply Lisbon Cathedral is the oldest church in the city and the see of Archdiocese of Lisbon.\n\nThis first building was completed between 1147 and the first decades of the 13th century in Late Romanesque style. At that time the relics of St. Vincent of Saragossa, patron saint of Lisbon, were brought to the cathedral from Southern Portugal. This cathedral follows a Latin cross plan with three aisles, a transept and a main chapel surrounded by a Gothic ambulatory. The church is connected with a cloister on the Eastern side. The main façade of the cathedral looks like a fortress, with two towers flanking the entrance and crenellations over the walls. This menacing appearance, also seen in other Portuguese cathedrals of the time, is a relic from the Reconquista period, when the cathedral could be used as a base to attack the enemy during a siege.\n\nFrom its first building period from 1147 until the first decades of the 13th century, Lisbon cathedral has preserved the West façade with a rose window (rebuilt from fragments in the 20th century), the main portal, the North lateral portal and the nave of the cathedral. The portals have interesting sculptured capitals with Romanesque motifs.\nThe nave is covered by barrel vaulting and has an upper, arched gallery (triforium). Light gets in through the rose windows of the West façade and transept, the narrow windows of the lateral aisles of the nave as well as the windows of the lantern tower of the transept. The general plan of the cathedral is very similar to that of the Cathedral of Coimbra, which dates from the same period. One of the chapels of the ambulatory has an interesting Romanesque iron gate.\n\nOriginally a 12th-century Templar stronghold, when the order was dissolved in the 14th century the Portuguese branch was turned into the Knights of the Order of Christ, that later supported Portugal's maritime discoveries of the 15th century. The Convent and Castle complex in Tomar is a historic and cultural monument which was listed in the list of UNESCO World Heritage list in 1983.\n\nThe convent was founded by the Order of Poor Knights of the Temple (or Templar Knights) in 1160. Its construction continued until the final part of the 12th century with the construction of the Charola (oratory), in one of the angles of the castle, completed by the Grand Master Gualdim Pais sometime around 1180.\n\nThe Romanesque round church (charola, rotunda) was built in the second half of the 12th century by the Knights Templar, as a 16-side polygonal structure, with strong buttresses, round windows and a bell-tower. Inside, the round church has a central, octagonal structure, connected by arches to a surrounding gallery (ambulatory). The general shape of the church is modelled after similar round structures in Jerusalem: the Mosque of Omar and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.\n\nThe capitals of the columns are still Romanesque (end of the 12th century) and depict vegetal and animal motifs, as well as a Daniel in the Lions' Den scene. The style of the capitals shows the influence of artists working on the Cathedral of Coimbra, which was being built at the same time as the round church.\n\nThe interior of the round church is magnificently decorated with late Gothic/Manueline sculptures and paintings, added during a renovation sponsored by King Manuel I starting in 1499. The pillars of the central octagon and the walls of the ambulatory have polychrome statues of saints and angels under exuberant Gothic canopies, while the walls and ceilings of the ambulatory are painted with Gothic patterns and panels depicting the life of Christ. The paintings are attributed to the workshop of the court painter of Manuel I, the Portuguese Jorge Afonso, while the sculptured decoration is attributed to Flemish sculptor Olivier of Gand and the Spaniard Hernán Muñoz. A magnificent panel depicting the martyrdom of Saint Sebastian, by Portuguese painter Gregório Lopes, was painted for the Round Church and now hangs in the National Museum of Ancient Art in Lisbon.\n\nAs previously stated, Romanesque architecture style reached Portugal by the end of the 11th century by the hand of Cluniac, Cistercian and Augustinian orders, bringing with them the monastical reforms that were already underway in their countries of origin. Their influence and importance on the spreading of this new art form can be asserted by the large number of churches and monasteries, one of the kind of Romanesque buildings that survived until our days.\n\nThe introduction of this new style coincides with the advance of the Reconquista to the south and the development of recent Portuguese independence and its territorial changes, reflecting this war paradigm and the need for defense profoundly engraved in the specific kind of Romanesque art we can find in Portugal: thick and menacing crenelated walls, towers, use of battlements, merlons, narrow slits and decorative austerity, like the church of Travanca Monastery with its heavy tower, the Monastery of Cete, the Church of Airães, São Martinho de Mouros, Paço de Sousa Monastery and the Monastery of Rates, one of the most artistically diverse. Almost every religious building has a fortress-like design because in the absence of castles, churches were always considered the best fortresses.\n\nTherefore, it is not surprising that monastical buildings comprise most of the Romanesque kind, specially in the northern areas of Entre-Douro-e-Minho, Tâmega and Sousa valleys and along the Douro river margins. With a significant rural population dispersed within these regions and organized in villages or concelhos we also find a significant number of parish churches, like São Gens de Boelhe, São Vicente de Sousa, São Pedro de Ferreira or Santa Maria de Cárquere Being very simple and small constructions, it is astonishing how each of them have such an iconographic variety of decorative features, being another unique \"indigenous\" characteristic of Portuguese Romanesque.\n\nPortuguese Romanesque churches have a longitudinal structure, following the basilical plan common throughout Europe: three aisles, transept and apse with two apsidoles, either semi-circular or square shaped, or just with one single aisle and apse. With semi-circular apse and apsidoles we have the churches of Ganfei, Rates, Pombeiro, São Tiago of Coimbra and Castro de Avelãs. The churches of São Cristóvão de Rio Mau and Santa Eulália de Arnoso, among others, present a square-shape apse and apsidoles.\n\nMost Romanesque monasteries, parish churches and abbey churches in Portugal are aisless halls with a projecting apse at the chancel end, or sometimes, a projecting rectangular chancel with a chancel arch that might be decorated with mouldings. More ambitious churches have aisles separated from the nave by arcades. The apse is lower or at the same height of the nave. Monasteries are usually larger with 3 aisles supported by decorated columns and piers. The walls are of massive thickness with few and comparatively small openings and almost entirely made out of granite stones.\n\nArcades can occur in storeys or stages. While the arcade of a cloister is typically of a single stage, the arcade that divides the nave and aisles in a church is typically of two stages, with a third stage of window openings known as the clerestory rising above them. Arcading on a large scale generally fulfils a structural purpose, but it is also used, generally on a smaller scale, as a decorative feature, both internally and externally where it is frequently \"blind arcading\" with only a wall or a narrow passage behind it.\n\nThe arches used in Portuguese Romanesque buildings follow the basic European model and are nearly always semicircular, for openings such as doors and windows, for vaults and for arcades. Wide doorways are usually surmounted by a semi-circular arch, except where a door with a lintel is set into a large arched recess and surmounted by a semi-circular lunette with decorative carving. These doors sometimes have a carved central jamb.\nNarrow doors and small windows might be surmounted by a solid stone lintel. Larger openings are nearly always arched. A characteristic feature of Portuguese Romanesque architecture, both ecclesiastic and domestic, is the pairing of two arcade openings, separated by a pillar or colonette and often set within a larger arch. There were some number of buildings in which pointed arches have been used extensively, apparently for stylistic reasons and it is believed that in these cases there is a direct influence of Mozarabic and/or Islamic architecture. At other late Romanesque churches the pointed arch was introduced as a structural device in ribbed vaulting. Its increasing application was fundamental to the development of Gothic architecture.\n\nAlthough basically rectangular, piers can often be of highly complex form, with half-segments of large hollow-core columns on the inner surface supporting the arch, or a clustered group of smaller shafts leading into the mouldings of the arch.\nPiers that occur at the intersection of two large arches, such as those under the crossing of the nave and transept, are commonly cruciform in shape, each arch having its own supporting rectangular pier at right angles to the other.\nColumns, colonnettes and attached shafts are also used structurally and for decoration. Arcades of columns cut from single pieces are also common in structures that do not bear massive weights of masonry, such as cloisters, where they are sometimes paired.\n\nThe majority of buildings have wooden roofs, generally of a simple truss, tie beam or king post form. In the case of trussed rafter roofs, they are sometimes lined with wooden ceilings in three sections like those that survive at the monasteries of Rates or Paço de Sousa. Some others are completely barrel vaulted or a mix between wooden roofs and a vaulted apse. In later stages rib vaulting started to be used as an experiment in main altar roofs.\n\nRomanesque churches generally have a single portal centrally placed on the west front, the focus of decoration for the facade of the building, and both the largest and the smallest, had lateral entrances that were commonly used by worshippers. Doorways have a character form, with the jambs having a series of receding planes, into each of which is set a circular shaft, all surmounted by a continuous abacus.\n\nThe semi-circular arch which rises from the abacus has the same serried planes and circular mouldings as the jambs. The arch consists typically of four planes containing three shafts, but there may be as many as twelve shafts, symbolic of the apostles.\n\nThe opening of the portal may be arched, or may be set with a lintel supporting a tympanum, generally carved. A carved tympanum generally constitutes the major sculptural work of a Romanesque church. The subject of the carving on a major portal may be Christ in Majesty or the Last Judgement. Lateral doors may include other subjects such as the Birth of Christ. The portal may be protected by a porch, from simple open porches to more elaborate structures. The religious context of the art at the time was well noticeable in the churches carvings, both inside the church as outside. They showed several episodes of the life of saints and various myths and biblical stories. Those that were sculptured specially in the tympanums, capitals and collonettes of the portals can be divided into two major themes:\n\nThe foliate Corinthian style provided the inspiration for many Romanesque capitals, and the accuracy with which they were carved depended very much on the availability of original models, being some much closer to the Classical than others.\n\nThe Corinthian capital is essentially round at the bottom where it sits on a circular column and square at the top, where it supports the wall or arch. This form of capital was maintained in the general proportions and outline of the Romanesque capital. This was achieved most simply by cutting a rectangular cube and taking the four lower corners off at an angle so that the block was square at the top, but octagonal at the bottom. This shape lent itself to a wide variety of superficial treatments, sometimes foliate in imitation of the source, but often figurative, without forgetting that the kind of stone used for construction of Romanesque churches in Portugal was mostly granite which made the carving of intricate and sharp details much harder.\n\nIt is however in the figurative capitals that the greatest originality is shown. While some are dependent on manuscripts illustrations of Biblical scenes and depictions of beasts and monsters, others are lively scenes of the legends of local saints, all of those with a deep religious meaning and pedagogical objective of teaching the faithful ones about virtues and sins guiding them through the right path.\n\nAnother important aspect of the iconography represented in capitals throughout the Portuguese Romanesque buildings are the scenes of daily life or mundane events such as musicians playing instruments, acrobats performing stunts, people dancing. Also, scenes representing the several economical activities of that period like peasants planting crops, farm animals (cows, sheep, goats, horses, etc.), as well as the social medieval hierarchy displaying knights, bishops and peasants each performing specific tasks according to their social positions.\n\nIn Romanesque architecture a corbel is a structural piece of stone jutting from a wall to carry a superincumbent weight, a type of bracket. The technique of corbelling, where rows of corbels deeply keyed inside a wall support a projecting wall or parapet, has been used since Neolithic times. A modillion is an ornate bracket, a corbel, underneath a cornice and supporting it, more elaborate than dentils (literally translated as small teeth), they were carved classically under a Corinthian or a Composite cornice, but may support any type of eaves cornice.\n\nCorbels in Portuguese Romanesque buildings often have an elaborately carved appearance with stylised heads of humans, animals and imaginary \"beasts\", or a wide range of motifs, sometimes end with a point apparently growing into the wall, or forming a knot, and often are supported by angels and other figures. In later periods the carved foliage and other ornaments used on corbels resembled those used in the capitals of columns.\n\nAnother particular feature of Romanesque buildings are corbel tables, a projecting moulded string course supported by a range of corbels. Sometimes these corbels carry a small arcade under the string course, the arches of which are pointed and trefoiled. As a rule corbel tables carries the gutter, but the arcaded corbel table was also used as a decoration to subdivide the storeys and break up the wall surface. In some buildings corbels will form a moulding, and above a plain piece of projecting wall forming a parapet.\n\nOne of the most striking features of a Romanesque church is its apse or \"east-end\", a recess covered with a hemispherical vault or semi-dome, also known as an Exedra, applied to a semi-circular or polygonal termination to the choir or aisles of a church at the liturgical east end (where the altar is), regardless of the shape of the roof, which may be flat, sloping, domed, or hemispherical. Apses and apsidoles can be either semi-circular, with or without a high chancel surrounded by an ambulatory, or a square end from which an apse is projected. Apsidoles can be also be found whenever the main altar is surrounded by lateral chapels.\n\nChurches in Portugal have long since followed the Pre-Romanesque kind of simple square-shaped apses typical of Visigothic and Mozarabic periods where east ends reflected the common structural plan of single-aisled churches as the main altar is separated from the nave by a transept or is just the extension of it. This style continued to be popular through the Romanesque and well into Gothic period. Fully Romanesque semi-circular apses started being more widespread in the regions between Douro and Minho in the second quarter of the 12th century (1125-1150), coming from the center region of Coimbra that was more open to foreign novelties as stated above. This kind of so-called \"French style\" semi-circular apses and apsidoles became more frequent not only in single nave churches, on which case there are no apsidoles, but particularly in three-aisled churches and monasteries built in the second half of the 12th century and during the 13th century.\n\nA cloister (from Latin claustrum, \"enclosure\") is a covered walk, open gallery, or open arcade running along the walls of buildings and forming a square or garth. The attachment of a cloister to a cathedral or church, commonly against a warm southern flank, usually indicates that it is (or once was) part of a monastic foundation, forming a continuous and solid architectural barrier that effectively separates the world of the monks from that of the serfs and workmen, whose lives and works went on outside and around the cloister.\n\nAlthough much of the cloisters in Portuguese churches and cathedrals have been extensively remodelled in later centuries, original Romanesque ones still survived, some almost completely preserved, others in various states of ruin. In contrast to their French counterparts, they often have suffered less modern intervention, and as a result, their current state is more likely to reflect their original arrangement and to preserve more fully the character of the visual imagery found there. Most arcades and masonry walls of the cloister carries simple wooden shed roofs as barrel or groin vaulted ceilings weren't common or likely didn't survived into our days. When ribbed vaults were introduced, the columns were articulated by multiple applied shafts, with smaller arcades in the openings to the garth.\n\nCloisters provided special accommodation for the activities that took place within it: stone benches were used for reading, books were sometimes stored in cupboards or armoires built into the walls. In addition, the cloister often contained a fountain or well, where the monks could wash and draw water to drink. The single, double, and even triple and quadruple capitals of 12th-century cloisters' columns were carved with foliate forms derived from the Classical period, such as vine scrolls and acanthus leaves, real and imaginary animals in combat or in heraldic positions, secular images such as musicians, entertainers, hunters, saints' lives and biblical events. Piers bore narrative scenes or relief figures of apostles or saints.\n\nThe Cistercian Romanesque architecture reflected the austerity and sobriety characteristic of that monastical Order in their quest for a mistic and spiritual goal preached by their leader and mentor Saint Bernard of Clairvaux.\nIn Portugal, besides a Cistercian Gothic-featured architecture (in which the Alcobaça Monastery is a universal symbol), there is a previous Romanesque style expressed by the Abbeys of Tarouca (construction started in 1144, the year of Cistercian monks arrival in Portugal), Salzedas (started in 1152) and Fiães (started in 1163).\n\nIn the architecture of Cistercian churches the transept is usually quite wide and the lateral aisles are covered with groined vaults that help to sustain the longitudinal central nave. There is a clear preference for square-shaped apses, more simple and economical to build. The columns and piers supporting pointed-arched arcades (already a proto-Gothic feature), have big strong capitals and stand on rectangular blocks on the ground floor. Although Tarouca Abbey was clearly inspired in the Burgundian abbeys of Clairvaux and Fontenay and Salzedas still have some similarities with Fontfroide, their authentic and magnificent Cistercian architectural features are mixed with local Portuguese decorative motifs.\n\nSome of smaller churches were also influenced by Cistercian Romanesque, like the vault of São Martinho de Mouros that shows the influx of Tarouca's abbey central nave vault and the exterior capitals in the main altar of Armamar church are significantly influenced by the outlayer of Salzedas abbey.\n\nThe Domus Municipalis (Latin: municipal house) is a Romanesque building in the northeastern municipality of Bragança. Its exact function, name and construction date have been the onset of much debate and controversy, even after many researches during the 20th century: first it was believed it could have been the city's Municipal house (Portuguese: \"Casa da Câmara\"), place of public meetings and a symbol of people's local government through their representatives, but more recent findings have presented basis for a theory that it could have served as cistern, but there are still doubts if that was its primary function.\n\nThis singular (and enigmatic) building of Romanesque civic architecture also presents challenges in its dating construction. An initial thesis stated that by its design and decorative features it could have been built as early as the 10th or 11th century, but a closer look actually tells us that was, most likely, built in the first half of the 13th century. Also, a deeper research showed that the existing building might be the result of two different dating constructions, with an older cistern on its lower floor and a meeting room built on top, using the already existing structure. Doubts about its real function arouse from a document of 1501 in which the author (according to the published writings of the Abbot of Baçal (1865-1947)) referred to the local record of Martim Anes (1185-1254) who spoke of the construction of the Domus upper level during his lifetime. In this account he stated that it was used as a meeting place for the \"good men\" of the municipality.\n\nThere is another document from 1503 referring to the building as both a \"Sala da Água\" (English: Water-room) and a place where the town representatives gathered to discuss and sign contracts, therefore, it should not be surprising if this supposed double-function turns out to be correct. Its construction date also becomes more clear in face of this facts, art-historian Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida noted that by its medallions, the diamond-shaped openings and the layout of windows we can date the upper level by the end of the 13th century or beginning of the 14th century, in which its already archaic Romanesque architectural style can be explained with the need of a compromise with the pre-existent cistern.\n\nLocated near the Castle's courtyard alongside the Church of Santa Maria, the structure is based on a multi-level irregular pentagon, constructed of rounded granite blocks and held together by mortar, with a barrel vaulted wooden roof supported by three arches and covered by tiles. Its floor-plan is slightly steeped and a natural water fountain was found in the Northwest corner at a low depth.\n\nIn sharp contrast to the reality throughout most of Europe, there are still some examples of Portuguese Romanesque civil architecture that survived to our days, specially the fortified noble residences or Domus Fortis (in Portuguese:\"Casa-Torre\"). Most are no longer more than single towers that stand out from more modern constructions carried out in the house that surrounds them, and many were remodelled in later Gothic and Renaissance styles, but their Romanesque features are still very much visible. These noble fortified manors were built within, or in the periphery, of feudal lands (Coutos or Honras), among agricultural fertile valleys. We can also find them in neighbouring areas of forests or mountain ranges where nobility could control new farm lands outside more occupied regions in which the purchase of new lands and titles was more difficult.\n\nAmong those we have the manors and towers of Vilar (Penafiel), Pousada (Guimarães), Dornelas in Braga, Oriz (Vila Verde), Lourosa do Campo (Arouca) and Quintela (Vila Real). In northern Portugal there were two kinds of fortified houses during the Middle Ages: the Manor house and the Domus Fortis. The manor house, associated with high and middle nobility, doesn't follow an architectural frame but are rather a cluster of different autonomous buildings, as opposite with the \"Domus Fortis\" that follows a specific kind of fortified structure which was originated by the last quarter of the 11th century becoming extensively widespread by the late 12th century and through the 13th and 14th centuries. This kind of model was adopted by the smaller ranks of nobility in search of social ascension in a way of displaying to local communities their newly acquired power.\n\nThe Domus Fortis is composed by several divisions:\n\n- The most important being the Tower, of square plan (round ones were rare in Portugal), fortifying the house and offering protection to their owners and respective servants in case of need. It was built with four levels, each corresponding to a single division. Just like a keep tower in castles, the main gate was accessed by the first floor rather than the ground floor. This ground floor was the reception and living room, as the upper floors were destined for private chambers.\n\n- A \"domus fortis\" also had a separate building coupled with or close to the tower, with rectangular plan and two floors. Those were usually the servants area and accommodations.\n\n- In some cases is reported the existence of a private chapel like in Vasconcelos Tower-house. Also other individual structures, like kitchens, were built close to water springs or small streams. No remains are left from these buildings although their existence if fully documented.\n\nMost of tower-houses were built in northern and central regions of Portugal that belonged to feudal areas. Some were progressively restored in later centuries reflecting more modern Renaissance and Baroque styles: like Aguiã, Refoios, Gomariz, Castro, Faralães and Barbosa Tower-Houses. In other cases their towers were separated from the main building like Silva, Quintela, Oriz and Penegate Towers, among others.\n\nConstruction activity of bridges during the Middle Ages is directly related to the need of restoring the old Roman road system that was already obsolete, in order to develop new connections and boost trading. Since the end of the 11th century that need was so urgent that building bridges and restoring the paveways were activities that started to be considered as pious. São Gonçalo of Amarante and São Lourenço Mendes, sponsors of the construction of Amarante and Cavês bridges, respectively, were called saints by popular acclamation, such as Saint Benizet of Avignon (France) or Sán Domingos da Calçada (La Rioja (Spain)), showing how much this phenomenon of bridge and road construction were considered extremely important elsewhere in Europe.\n\nIn the will of monarchs, noblemen and clergymen there are many references to donations for building bridges, King D.Afonso Henriques (1109-1185) himself contributed to the construction of Coimbra, Ave and Piares (Douro river) bridges.\nThe stonemasons of the Romanesque period were more careful about the structural design and maintenance of bridges than their previous Roman counterparts, and looked for more solid grounds to build them, and because of that, according to Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida, medieval bridges resisted better against the danger of floodings and the test of time.\n\nRomanesque bridges present large arches whose height had to be balanced with the use of abutments at each end by transferring the weight of the bridge and its loads partially into a horizontal thrust restrained by the abutments at either side. Bridge builders also improved on the Roman structures by using narrower piers, thinner arch barrels and lower span-rise ratios.\nExamples of these are the bridges of Lagoncinha (12th century), over the Ave River, with six arches, Prado bridge over the Cávado River (11th century), with nine arches and Cavês bridge over the Tâmega River (13th century).\n\nBridge building deeply shaped the Portuguese medieval landscape. Among the Romanesque civil architecture and by the economical and technical means used for their construction, the building of bridges had the most impact in everyday life, benefiting communication between people.\n\nIn Portugal, castles are directly related with military needs and the state of continuous warfare characterised by the Reconquista. Populations living closer of the border between Christians and Muslims were under threat of constant raids and the advance of either sides in pursue of territorial conquest. The region more precociously fortified was the area south of the Douro river, where in the 10th century almost all the population centers had their castle. The majority of these defensive positions, the rural castles, were of very simple structure and took advantage of natural conditions such as high places with granite outcrops, that made access difficult. During the next three centuries (10th to 13th centuries) we witness a boom of castles due to the ever-growing necessity to provide a territorial passive defense.\n\nThe strength of a Romanesque castle sits in the thickness and height of its walls in order to resist sieges. The Allure or round-path (Portuguese: Adarve) was intertwinned with towers in order to break continuous cloths of wall and in the 12th century other outer sets of walls were built next to castles themselves to shelter populations and cattle as attested in the Castle of Castro Laboreiro.\n\nThe Romanesque castle testifies to the triumph of rural nobility and is also the symbol of a territory's safety. During this period it consisted of a wall with allures, battlements and a central tower: the Keep, symbol of feudal power, and the biggest innovation to the fortress. This element has its origins in the domus fortis, the strengthened noble residence.\n\nBetween the North and the South of Portugal, particularly in the regions defined by the margins of the Mondego and Tejo Rivers, there are notable differences in military structures. In the North castles have a more basic structure and are very tied to fortifications typified in pre-Romanesque era. Going southwards castles display more advanced techniques in the field of military architecture. The strategic area was then concentrated on the border with the Moors where the Military Orders would play a key role. In the North we can find the castles of Lanhoso, Castro Laboreiro, Lindoso, Melgaço, Arnoia, Pena de Aguiar, Trancoso, Vilar Maior, and the most outstanding Guimarães Castle. This fortress, documented since around 950 AD, had undergone restoration works during the reign of D.Afonso Henriques and later changes in its layout in the Gothic period.\n\nBuilt under the tenure of Gualdim Pais as Master of the Knights Templar (1157-1195), the castles of Pombal (c.1156), Tomar (1160), Monsanto (1165), Penas Roias (1166), Almourol (1171) and Longroiva (1174) demonstrate the importance of the Templars in the development of Portuguese military architecture during the second half of the 12th century. The first document stating the Knights Templar presence in Portugal dates back to 1128, when Queen D.Teresa donated them the castle of Soure. Its keep, built on the north side of the fortress, retains a distinctive feature: the Alambor, a reinforced base for the tower using a stone-slanted ramp. This solution gives it greater strength and makes an assault on its walls harder to accomplish. This feature can also be seen in the Keep of Pombal Castle.\n\nAt Tomar Castle, headquarters of the Order in Portugal, the alambor was built along the outer walls of the fortification. With origins in the military architecture developed by the Crusaders in the Holy Land, this constructive technique was used in the castle of Saône and the Krak des Chevaliers, both located in Syria, where Gualdim Pais was stationed between 1151 and 1156. It owns to the Templar Order some of the most innovative solutions that the Portuguese military architecture met throughout the 12th century.\n\nThe arrival of the Cistercians in Portugal after 1142 coincided with the first steps on the development of the new Gothic artistical style in France. Those initial Gothic features (pointed arch, taller and slimmer columns, groin and rib vaults, flying buttresses and more windows), although still with much Romanesque flavour, were implemented in Cistercian abbeys as they matched the exact kind of austere and ascetic teachings preached by their leader and mentor Saint Bernard of Clairvaux.\n\nThus, in Portugal, the strong presence and popularity of Romanesque until later centuries meant that this decorative and architectural Cistercian model was the perfect basis for the slow change into Gothic style, without never completely cutting off with the previous Romanesque. Instead, these two styles merged in Portuguese architecture like nowhere else in Europe within a specific kind called Mendicant Gothic, typical of monastic buildings. Alcobaça, one of the biggest Cistercian abbeys in the world, is the first fully Gothic building in Portugal, but it still has a heavy and austere exterior appearance, only balanced by its tall and massive rib vaulted central nave and aisles. Churches like Santa Maria dos Olivais in Tomar, or São João de Alporão in Santarém are perfect examples of this Mendicant transitional period between the Romanesque and the definitive settle of Gothic style, which would only be a reality by the 14th and 15th centuries.\n\nÉvora Cathedral is another example of Romanesque/Gothic transition, combining both in a single monument. Built between 1186 and 1204 (but only fully completed by 1250) with a clear Romanesque outlook, it was again enlarged circa 1280-1340, this time in early Gothic style. The cathedral received several valuable additions through time, such as the cloisters (Gothic period - 14th century), or its zimborium (dome), built in the late 13th century and another addition already showing the new Gothic features.\n\nRomanesque never truly ceased to be expressed in various ways both decorative and structural until as late as the 16th century, thus most historians name it as Resistance Romanesque, referring to a specific kind of buildings that present a very marked statement of this period even if mixed with later artistical styles (Gothic, Manueline, Renaissance). Some examples of those are the Churches of Caminha, (built in the late 15th century), Torre de Moncorvo (built in the early 16th century), and the Cathedral of Viana do Castelo (also from the 15th century).\n\n<gallery mode=packed caption=\"Romanesque/Gothic-transition buildings\" heights=\"220px\">\nFile:CaminhaMatrizChurch2.jpg|Church of Caminha (15th/16th centuries).

The two have gone on to create several award-winning films under Solaris Pictures' banner, focusing on LGBT issues and HIV/AIDS.\n\nSolaris Pictures is perhaps the only Indian film production company that has consistently been making bold and path-breaking films on issues such as homosexuality and gay rights, films that engage the audience and initiate dialogues on issues dealing with health and sexuality, human rights, and the gay and transgender communities.\n\nPrevious productions include: The Pink Mirror, which has won two Best Film awards, and was screened at over 72 festivals; Yours Emotionally! which was played at several international festivals and 68 Pages, which won the Silver Remi award at the 2008 WorldFest Houston. These films have made visible Indian queer characters and issues to a global audience, through a unique style that combines Bollywood melodrama with international avant-garde film techniques.\n\nSolaris Pictures is the Associate Producer of Project Bolo - an Indian LGBT Oral History Project that interviews 20 Indian LGBT persons in Mumbai, Pune, Lucknow and New Delhi.\n\nSolaris Pictures believes in pushing the envelope - both as producer and as distributor, and in partnering with grassroots NGOs and community-based organizations in India, and international collaborators from around the world. It produces films that go beyond mere entertainment, to emotionally engage the audience and initiate dialogues about underserved issues like health and sexuality, human rights, gay and transgender issues.\n\nThe company has also collaborated in producing more than 100 hours of television content for serials like Rishtey, Gubbare, Kagaar and has produced advertising for companies like Life Insurance Corporation of India, H & R Johnson, Godrej, Rupa, Zee TV. Thei social awareness films and spots for the National Institute for Hearing Handicapped, Cancer Patients Aid Association and Cama & Albless Hospital have been telecast on both DD National and Mumbai Doordarshan.\n\nSolaris Pictures is one of the principal organizers of Kashish Mumbai Queer Film Festival that was first held in April 2010 in Mumbai at PVR Cinemas and Alliance Francaise and then in 2011 and 2012 at Cinemax Versova and Alliance Francaise\n\nSolaris Pictures has also organized Flashpoint Human Rights Film Festival in Mumbai and New Delhi in 2010/2011 and 2011/2012.\n\nDrama/ 90 mins / India / 2007 / Hindi with English subtitles\nDirected and Written by Sridhar Rangayan\nProducer: The Humsafar Trust \nAssociate Producer : Solaris Pictures\n\nComing from a country like India that is still in denial, where being HIV+ is still a curse, 68 Pages rips open the underbelly of its society to reveal how it stigmatizes and shuns those who are HIV+ or even those who just want to be what they are. Through 68 Pages of a counselors diary, we see the stories of Paayal, a sex worker; Nishit, an ID user; Kiran, a gay man and Umrao, a transsexual bar dancer - their stories of pain and fear, humiliation and rejection - not only by the society, but even by their loved ones. While these stories expose the shallowness of the system, it also offers hope and healing by trying to bring about a better understanding of their fight to live with dignity. The film is a tribute to the human spirit of optimism and survival. { Source: imdb} \n\nDrama/Gay / HD / 86 mins / UK-India / 2006\nDirected and Written by Sridhar Rangayan\nProducer: Wise Thoughts (UK)\nAssociate Producer: Solaris Pictures (India)\n\nTwo Brits, Ravi and Paul travel to India where they meet Murthy and Anna an older gay couple that have managed to form a partnership and live together for over 20 years.

It's a clash of the east and west. The drag queens, who are expert in the art of seduction with their wit, innuendo and cunning or the young teenager who is saucy, slutty and sly? Underneath the campy humorous exterior, the film is an exploration of the Indian gay landscape and understanding of the deep, humanly tender bondings that exist between drag queens in India who form unique, non-patriarchal families. Using the Bollywood soap idiom of song, dance and drama and for the first time in the Indian drag queens' very own language, Hindi, the film also explores other veiled issues related to the Indian gay community: the lurking threat of HIV/AIDS. {Source: imdb} \n\nSolaris Pictures' films and television projects have won several awards, both Indian and international.\n(for film “Gulabi Aaina)\n\n"}

Most stations receive contestable Government funding from Te Māngai Pāho to operate on behalf of affiliated iwi (tribes) or hapu (sub-tribes). Under their funding agreement, the stations must produce programmes in the local Māori language and actively promote local Māori culture.\n\nMost stations combine an English language urban contemporary playlist during breakfast and drive shows with full service broadcasting and Māori language programmes at other times of the day. They have their own local shows, personalities and breakfast programmes, and broadcast through both terrestrial frequencies and online streams. There are regular segments updating people about local events, and teaching people Māori language and tikanga (customs). The stations also produce local news shows, Māori music, educational programmes, comedies and dramas.\n\nThe network oversees the sharing of news bulletins, the pooling of resources and the production of network programmes. Manukau's Radio Waatea operates the network news service and produces network programmes. Its chief executive, Willie Jackson, also serves as association chairman. Programmes are shared and simulcast on a high-speed wide area network. Almost every Māori person in New Zealand lives within the range of an iwi radio frequency, but transmission issues have been reported in remote areas.\n\nThe first Māori language to be broadcast on the radio were songs. A programme of Māori history, stories and songs were broadcast around the country on Waitangi Day 1928, and a regular programme featuring correct pronunciation of Māori began the same year. Māori broadcasters were appointed: Lou Paul of Ngāti Whātua in Auckland, Kīngi Tāhiwi of Ngāti Raukawa in Wellington, Te Ari Pītama of Ngāi Tahu in Christchurch, and broadcasting pioneer Airini Grenell of Ngāi Tahu in Dunedin. The first programme entirely in the Māori language was a news bulletin about World War II and local Māori issues, presented by Wiremu Bill Parker in 1940. Other shows followed, including \"Nga pao me nga pakiwaitara a te Maori: song and story of the Maori\", based in Wellington, and \"Te reo o te Māori\", broadcast from Napier.\n\nLeo Fowler set up a Māori Programmes Section of the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation in 1964, and, alongside Bill Kerekere took a mobile broadcasting studio to important Māori events. The department produced the English language Māori affairs programme \"Te puna wai kōrero\" and helped increase airtime for Māori music and show bands, including the Patea Māori Club hit Poi E. Te Reo o Aotearoa, a Māori and Pacific unit of New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation's successor Radio New Zealand, was set up in 1978 to produce Māori and Pacific programmes.\n\nBy the 1970s state broadcasters broadcast less than 90 minutes of Māori language and Māori interest programming a week, and there were growing concerns about the decline in fluent Māori speakers. Victoria University of Wellington’s Te Reo Māori Society campaigned for Māori radio, helping to set up Te Reo o Poneke, the first Māori-owned radio operation, using airtime on Wellington student radio station Radio Active in 1983. Other part-time Māori radio stations were also set up by young volunteers: Ōtaki's Te Reo o Raukawa in 1985, and Mangamuka's Tautoko Radio and Ruatōria's Radio Ngāti Porou in 1987. The establishment of a Māori Radio Network was also discussed at a hui or gathering at Takapuwahia Marae in Porirua. Te Reo o Poneke gained a full-time license in 1987, becoming the pan-tribal Wellington radio station Te Upoko O Te Ika. The first bilingual school opened at Ruatoki in Urewera in 1978, and the Māori Language Commission was formed when Māori language became an official language in 1987. However, Māori culture continued to be underrepresented on New Zealand radio.\n\nTairawhiti Polytechnic head of Māori studies Joe Te Rito operated a part-time station, Te Toa Takitini, on the polytechnic's Gisborne campus in 1988 and 1989, in an effort to broadcast Rongomaiwahine-Ngāti Kahungunu's local elders and native speakers. A year later he relaunched it as full-time station Radio Kahungunu in Hastings, to increase grammatical and spoken Māori language fluency, and expose the language to homes where no one spoke it. Te Rito archived more than 2000 programme recordings, which he used to study and translate the tribe's distinctive dialect, teach courses on the local spoken and written language, and provide an international model for preserving dialects in other communities in Asia and the Pacific.\n\nThe Fourth Labour Government deregulated the radio industry during the 1980s, selling the rights to use radio frequencies to private companies. The Wellington Māori Language Board, Nga Kaiwhakapumau i te Reo, was supporting the self-funded Te Upoko O Te Ika, and claimed the Government's sell off of broadcasting spectrum amounted to theft. Alongside the New Zealand Māori Council jointly, it challenged the spectrum sell off and the lack of support for Māori broadcasting. In one case brought through the Waitangi Tribunal, a permanent commission set up to investigate breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi, they argued the treaty gave them sovereignty over the airwaves and broadcast spectrum. They sought a share of the proceeds from the sale of rights to spectrum frequencies, and frequencies for their own use. Other cases followed through the High Court and Court of Appeal, with one case reaching the Privy Council in London.\n\nThe Government addressed the claim by instructing Radio New Zealand and Television New Zealand to broadcast more Māori programmes, and funding the establishment of Māori-owned and Māori-controlled radio stations. Twenty one iwi radio stations were started between 1989 and 1994. These were initially funded by NZ on Air from 1990, with six percent of broadcasting fees allocated to Māori broadcasting. A call for Māori to have greater control of funding led to the establishment of a separate Te Mangai Paho funding agency in 1995, and this agency became funded through taxation. The establishment of these stations allowed the Government to justify the sale of Radio New Zealand's commercial Newstalk ZB and ZM stations to the privately owned Australian Radio Network partnership in 1996, after the sale was challenged in the High Court and Court of Appeal.\n\nSeveral iwi applied for Government funding to establish radio stations in areas with significant Māori populations, developing an iwi-based radio network. However, the new stations struggled to survive as budgets did not cover the costs, volunteer staff lost enthusiasm, staff training was inadequate, and funding was insufficient to create professional career paths for Māori radio announcers and managers. Three stations broadcast on AM frequencies, costing an extra $100,000 a year than FM frequencies, but received the same flat rate of funding. \nRadio Ngāti Porou station manager Ngahiwi Apanui set up a joint venture between iwi stations, the national advertising agency Māori Media Network, in 1994 to increase each station's sources of revenue. The Māori Communication Network was set up in 1997.\n\nMeanwhile, the first Māori language radio network, Aotearoa Radio or Irirrangi Radio, began in Auckland on 18 July 1988 on a short-term warrant, broadcasting on 1XO 603 AM. It gained a full-time warrant in 1989, extending to Tauranga on 1XV 603 AM, Wellington on 2XO 1323 AM and Christchurch on 3XQ 1323 AM. Radio and television producer Ray Waru was the chief executive. Teacher, lecturer and consultant Haare Williams served as the general manager. Aotearoa Radio operated alongside the iwi radio stations, and broadcast a range of programmes on Māori issues, and gave airtime to Māori women at a time when women and Māori were both underrepresented in radio. Tipene O'Regan, Beverly Adlam, Pauline Butt, Toby Curtis, Wiremui Ohia, Temuera Morrison, Dalvanius Prime, Moana Maniapoto-Jackson, Neil Gudsell, James Waerea, Libby Hakaraia, Trada Chadwick and Koro Wetere were involved in the Māori Radio Board during this period. The network closed in 1997.\n\nIn June 1998, the first Māori language radio serial began airing on iwi radio, and in July 1997 NZ On Air began distributing Māori music compilation CDs to English language radio stations to promote greater air time for Māori performers and Māori language music. Te Māngai Pāho also kept records of the percentage of Māori language in the programming of each iwi station, and talked with stations about increasing the use of Māori language.\n\nNgāti Whātua took a leading role in iwi radio during the 1990s and early 2000s through its subsidiary Mai Media. The iwi started urban contemporary station, Mai FM, in Auckland in July 1992, and New Zealand's first Māori language network, Ruia Mai Te Ratonga Irirangi o te Motu 1179AM, in April 1996. Through Ruia Mai it secured a contract with Te Māngai Pāho to provide Māori language news bulletins, which broadcast on 26 iwi radio stations. It also produced a range of current affairs, documentary and children's programmes. Some of these programmes were recognised in the New Zealand Radio Awards.\n\nMai FM was commercially successful and was expanded to other regions. It formed a broadcasting partnership with Ngai Tahu's Tahu FM in Christchurch between 1996 and 2001, and took over one of the frequencies of Te Arawa's Whanau FM in 1998. Ruia Mai, by contrast, reached a smaller audience of fluent Māori language speakers, and focused on programmes reflecting Ngāti Whatua and Māori culture. It was reliant on its news and current affairs contract with Te Māngai Pāho, and closed in 2004 when it lost the contract to bilingual radio station Radio Waatea. Ngāti Whatua retained the frequency, initially leasing it out to The Voice of Samoa before using it for AKE 1179AM.\n\nIn 2006, Te Māngai Pāho spent $2 million upgrading studios, equipment and technical capacity for each Iwi Radio Network station. Emare Rose Nikora, a leader of the Māori language revival movement, received a Queen's Service Medal for services to Māori for her role in setting up Tokoroa's Te Reo Irirangi o Ngati Raukawa Trust and Ruakawa FM. She was the station's co-founder, first Māori language newsreader, manager and board member.\n\nWhanganui's Awa FM relocated in 2012 and went through major restructuring in 2014, leaving it with just three staff members. Gisborne's Radio Ngāti Porou was investigated by Te Māngai Pāho in 2014, and in August its financial adviser resigned. In the Far North, the Tautoko FM building to the ground on 18 May 2015, cutting power to the small community of Mangamuka.\n\nIwi radio stations receive a share $11.7 million in Government funding each year, and can each be eligible for an annual Government grant of $350,000. They also source funding from sponsorship, advertising and leasing of studio space. Government-funded stations must broadcast at least eight hours of Māori language content between 6am and 12pm each day of the week. Station managers are also usually required to be proficient in the Māori language. Between 0.9% and 1.2% of each station's annual revenue is returned to the music industry through Recorded Music NZ, with each station treated differently for licensing purposes.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2018, the Iwi Radio Network received an extra $12 million to cover new operating costs and to assess the feasibility of expanding the network with new iwi stations, and $1.5 million towards archiving historic Māori language programmes. Māori Affairs Minister Pita Sharples said the extra funding would increase Māori language content and programme quality, and would ensure interviews with dead elders would be not be lost. The funding was specifically allocated to increasing community engagement with iwi stations, increasing Māori language hours and expanding the number of people the network reached. Network chairman Willie Jackson said many iwi stations were struggling, and welcomed and desperately needed the extra funding.\n\nA two-year Massey University survey of 30,000 people, published in 2003, indicated 50 percent of Māori in Iwi Radio Network broadcast areas listened to an iwi station. The results were consistent with those of similar surveys by individual stations, and countered the misconception that iwi stations reached small and specific audiences. According to the research, iwi stations were often associated with old music and interviews with elders, but many Māori listeners used it to stay in touch with their culture, family history, spirituality and community, and maintain their language skills. Further Auckland University of Technology research in 2009 suggested the potential audience of iwi radio stations would increase due to the growth of New Zealand's Māori and Pacific population.\n\nMāori language advocates have recognised radio broadcasting as having a small but significant role in bringing Māori language to New Zealand audiences for more than half a century, particularly since the establishment of radio stations under iwi control. Postcolonialists have also suggested the Iwi Radio Network is a form of decolonisation, a means of achieving decolonisation, and a way to assert cultural identity and challenge Pākeha cultural dominance. Massey University research in 2006 assessed five year qualitative and quantitative research, literature on the long term history of the Māori language, comparative studies between Māori and Irish radio, and Tūhoe's experiences setting up a radio station, and found the Iwi Radio Network had a positive impact on Māori language revitalisation. The stations have failed to counter a decline in the number of fluent Māori speakers in the 2010s, but continue to be part of the strategy to promote it.\n\nThe National Māori Radio Network has held its own annual awards since 2012. Te Upoko o te Ika was the inaugural winner of Station of the Year, Willie Jackson calling it a tribute to their work towards promoting the Māori language. Taranaki's Korimako FM won Station of the Year in 2013. Maniapoto FM in Te Kuiti, Moana Radio in Tauranga, Radio Ngāti Porou in Ruatoria, Te Korimako in New Plymouth and Te Hiku o te Ika in Kaitaia were finalists for Station for the Year in 2014.\n\nThe stations are also eligible for awards at the New Zealand Radio Awards. One award, for Iwi Station of the Year, recognises radio networks or individual stations which have performed outstandingly as a champion of Māori language and culture. The station is judged on the quality and effectiveness of its Māori language use, and its programmes, client relations, community involvements, news and current affairs, personality strength, promotions and marketing campaigns. Tumeke FM won Iwi Station of the Year in 2014. Ngati Porou won the award in 2013, but faced criticism about its management and financial oversight a few months later.\n\nThe iwi stations broadcast a range of programmes during the day, combining the use of conversational Māori with commercially viable English language programmes. Many weekend programmes cover special interests, use local Māori language dialects, or cater to local Pacific Island communities. For example, Tokoroa's Ruakawa FM follows a conventional radio schedule, with programmes like Daybreak with Roger Mahu, Rangatahi Days with Ngaitarangi Toma, and night show Rangatahi Vibes geared to younger audiences. The weekend line-up includes the Hakinakina Hard Saturday sports morning show with Josiah Teokotai, and Sunday night Te Taura Vaanaga show for the local Cook Island community.\n\nManawatu's Kia Ora FM broadcasts a specialist weekly science programme showcasing the research of Massey University researchers and postgraduate students. Musician, actor and commentator Moana Maniapoto has hosted several iwi radio programmes since 1990, including an evening programme on Radio Waatea. The Whanau Show music programme on Wellington's Te Upoko o te Ika on 6 June 1995, began touring the country in 1997, has been broadcast on nine iwi stations and is currently based at Gisborne's Turanga FM.\n\nMoana Radio's Tai Pari Tai Timu programme is simulcast across most of the Iwi Radio Network from midnight to 6.00am every day. The show's rotating hosts discuss news, views, issues and events from the Māori world in a free format. Retro phone requests are received after 4.00am.\n\nSome stations have their own overnight shows. For example, Cilla Gardiner's Country Music Show airs some nights on Tokoroa's Raukawa FM.\n\nRadio Waatea produces hourly bulletins for the Iwi Radio Network under a contract with Te Māngai Pāho. Its Waatea News website publishes national news articles and interviews, and bulletins for Te Hiku o Te Ika (Auckland and Northland), Tainui (Waikato), Te Korimako (Taranaki and Wanganui), Te Manuka Tutahi (Bay of Plenty), Turanganui A Kiwa (Gisborne and Hawke's Bay), and Te Upoko o Te Ika (Wellington and the South Island). A 2013 Queensland University of Technology cited the service as an example of journalistic practices being shaped by traditional indigenous values . Whitireia New Zealand runs a course preparing people to become Iwi Radio Network journalists.\n\nIwi stations broadcast live coverage of sports games, kapa haka competitions and other news events. Many Waitangi Tribunal hearings have been broadcast live on iwi radio stations, from the inquiry into the claims of Whanganui tribes in 2007 and 2008 to the inquiry into Ngā Puhi claims in 2015. During the 2011 Rugby World Cup the stations gained rights to simulcast live Māori language commentaries from the TV channel Te Reo. Turanga FM broadcasts live commentaries of Poverty Bay Rugby Football Union games on some weekend afternoons. The Māori Sports Awards are also broadcast live across the network each November.\n\nMost iwi stations are involved in locals events, news media and other iwi or pan-tribal activities. Tokoroa's Raukawa FM, for example, has been holding concerts since December 1990, sponsored the Tainui Games in Kawhia in January 1992, supported the Raukawa Education and Training Establishment in June 1992, and helped set up the first Raukawa newspaper, Te Paki o Raukawa Kia Ora News, in August 1992. Radio Kahungunu set a special broadcast during the 2008 Takitimu Festival, broadcasting a live simulcast of its station on 105.5 FM from the nearby Hawke's Bay Showgrounds. Many stations are service contractors and offer their studios for hire. Rotorua's Te Arawa FM, for example, operates as Te Arawa Communications and provides marketing, film and audio engineering services, and has recently started a very successful commercial station The Heat 99.1FM \n\nEach station has its own website, and most stations stream online. Many of the websites were designed by Māori web developers. For example, the websites of Radio Kahungunu, Tekorimako 94.5FM and Turanga FM were the work of Ngāti Porou designer Alex Walker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52198546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52198546", "title": "Tony Heaton", "text": "Tony Heaton\n\nAnthony James Heaton OBE (born 11 October 1954) is a British sculptor, disability rights activist and arts administrator, who was awarded an OBE in 2013 for services to the arts and the disability arts movement. He was CEO of the arts charity Shape until March 2017. In 2012, he won the competition to produce an installation celebrating Channel 4's involvement in the London 2012 Paralympic Games. This produced his 'Monument for the Unintended Performer'.\n\nHeaton was born in Preston, Lancashire, in 1954, the son of a coppersmith. When, at the age of 16, a motor bike accident left him with a spinal injury, he switched from a comprehensive school to a local arts college at Southport. From 1972, he was self-employed as artist, sign writer, disc jockey, record shop proprietor, progressive rock band member and mural painter. According to a Disability Arts Online profile, at this period \"Heaton gathered enormous expertise and self-reliance whilst appearing to drift aimlessly\". In 1986 he enrolled on a visual arts degree at Lancaster University whilst earning a living as a sign-painter.\n\nA contemporary of Andy Goldsworthy, Heaton experimented with environmental sculpture on sands at Morecambe Bay. Lancaster's head of sculpture, Paul Hatton, noted that the marks left by Heaton were immediately distinguishable from the footprints of his fellow students and urged him to develop work about this. Heaton states that, \"A chance comment about how the marks left in the sand by my feet and crutches made my tracks immediately identifiable became the catalyst for a whole series of works relating to disability and my interaction with the environment\". Heaton exhibited a plaster cast of his feet and stick imprints, his first piece of disability art.\n\nHeaton’s early sculptures often use what Disability Arts in London magazine described as \"the everyday impedimenta of disability: collecting cans, NHS wheelchairs, X-rays, Part M of the Building Regulations\". But his work contradicts the normal associations of such materials by turning them into \"profound and joyously witty statements about the nature of our oppression\".\n\nAn early piece, \"Springback\" (1990), is an assemblage including a spinal X-Ray juxtaposed above the shock absorber springs of a scrapped motorcycle, referring to the accident which caused his impairment and the metal strengthening spring placed inside his spine.\n\n'Shaken..not Stirred' (1991) consisted of a seven-feet high pyramid of 1,760 charity collecting cans, its ascending ranks of red plastic referring to the hierarchical nature of the charity system. The whole edifice was brought crashing to the ground when Heaton threw an artificial leg at it, suggesting that the hierarchical system could be destroyed by the collective power of disabled people. As his work has developed, it has embodied ideas about disability and impairment. For instance, \"Split\" (1995) is a woodcarving made from a piece of ash discarded by a wood turner as useless because it has a shake; a fault running through it. Heaton saw this as \"indicative of a society that sees only perfection and disregards all that is damaged or perceived as impaired\".\nThe 1994 sculpture, ‘Great Britain from a Wheelchair’ is a map of Britain made from two grey NHS wheelchairs. \"A delightful game, it forms a wonderful repudiation of the value judgement ('This is for some tragic bastard', in Heaton’s words) implicit in the wheelchairs.\" An image of this work was chosen by the National Disability Arts Collection and Archive as an example of work from the ‘golden age’ of disability arts. During the 2012 Paralympics Heaton was invited to redesign 'Great Britain From a Wheelchair' as lecterns for Lord Coe and Sir Phillip Craven during the opening and closing ceremonies.\n\nIn 2012, he was commissioned to produce ‘Monument to the Unintended Performer’, an installation for the Big 4 sculpture sited outside Channel Four’s offices. It brought together three elements in addition to the Big 4: the first based on the classical Greek sculpture Discobolus, the discus thrower, evoking the spirit of the Olympics; the second element, a circle, representing the wheel of the international symbol of access; and lastly, the introduction of gold, silver and bronze considers hierarchy. Heaton stated: \"I wanted to use the structure of the Big 4 as one of four elements that would fuse together to form a new cohesive piece - which would provoke thought and celebrate Channel 4's involvement and commitment to the Paralympics. The subtext is the assertion that disabled people are almost always the object of scrutiny and curiosity.\"\n\n'Gold Lamé', included in the 2014 exhibition Art of The Lived Experiment, is an invalid car covered in gold leaf. The title puns on the word \"lame\". Heaton states that the Invacar has been “transformed from prosthetic to sculpture, transmuted from spazz blue to gold, from Lame to Lamé”, mirroring his own life adjustments, where he says, \"I transmuted from biker to invalid\".\n\nFrom 1997 to 2007, Heaton was based in Dorset, as Director of the Holton Lee Trust which offers a mix of environmental, artistic and spiritual activities, with short stay residential facilities for Disabled people, in an SSSI comprising 350 acres of woodland, reed bed and heath land landscape adjacent to Poole Harbour.\n\nHeaton developed a 10-year strategic plan for the organisation: a contemporary arts and education programme based on a series of accessible buildings including a gallery and artists’ studios, which would enable a new programme of artistic work, a growth in residential capacity and a focus for disability arts. All the buildings would use local materials blending in with Holton Lee's natural surroundings.\n\nThe first of these, Faith House gallery, designed by Tony Fretton was hailed by Jonathan Glancey in the Guardian as ‘one of the most beautiful new buildings in Britain’.\n\nIn 2002, Heaton organised the DA21 Disability Arts Conference at Holton Lee. He also planned the inaugural conference to discuss the establishment of what would become the National Disability Arts Collection and Archive. The idea then envisaged was to create a purpose-built archive as part of the developing Holton Lee campus. This was abandoned after Heaton moved on. NDACA will now take the form of an interactive website and catalogue, after receiving funding of nearly £1 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund in 2015.\n\nIn 2007 Heaton became CEO of Shape Arts, the arts and disability charity founded by dancer Gina Levete. He brought to the organisation a new emphasis on disability arts and professional opportunities for artists.\n\nHe instituted the Adam Reynolds Memorial Bursary, which provides 3-month bursaries for disabled artists to undertake residencies at leading visual arts institutions. These have included the Victoria and Albert Museum, Camden Arts Centre, Spike Island, The Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art, the Bluecoat Gallery and New Art Gallery Walsall. The bursary is named after the late sculptor, with whom Heaton had a close friendship. Early winners were Caroline Cardus, Aaron Williamson, Sally Booth and Noëmi Lakmaier.\n\nHe also created the Shape Open, an annual open exhibition of artwork by disabled and non-disabled artists created in response to a disability-centred theme. The exhibition's patron is Yinka Shonibare, at whose Guest Projects space in Hackney, London the 2016 exhibition took place.\n\nHeaton has announced that he will stand down as CEO in 2017 and become Chair of the organisation.\n\nHeaton was awarded an OBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours, 2013, for services to the arts and the disability arts movement.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeaton was chosen by artist Tanya Raabe, in an interview with BBC Ouch, as one of her ideal dinner guests, along with Michael Caine, Frida Kahlo, her husband Diego Rivera, \"because he’s a womaniser and I think he’d get on marvellously with Tony Heaton’‘ and her best friend, Ann Young.\n\n"}

These trollz were based on the troll doll created in the 1960s.\n\nThe main characters in the series are collectively known as the \"Best Friends For Life\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpell Phones are devices based on a real life cellphones, but are adapted to provide functions for magic and spellbeads as well as provide the standard functions of a normal cellphone. \"Spell Calls\" are used to cast spells on other trollz across long distances. To initiate a Spell Call, the caller places a spell bead in the spell bead slot after inciting the incantation and then dialing the phone number of the intended recipient and hitting the cast button. The Spell Phone then transfers the spell through the phone line and when the recipient picks up the phone the spell is released through the receiver of the phone. It is a useful function that allows trollz to cast spells across long distances, but a lot of teenagers misuse the function and instead use it to play pranks.\n\n"}

Due to the song's popularity, the group renamed to \"Zangaléwa\" during its mainstream success. Zangaléwa pays tribute to African skirmishers (a.k.a. tirailleurs) during World War II. Most of the band members were in the Cameroonian Army themselves, and used the song in fund-raising efforts for Comic Relief.\n\nThe languages present in the song's lyrics (Douala, French, patois, and the pidgin English of some parts of West Africa) make clear that the song originates from the area of Cameroon but the circumstances surrounding the time of the song's origin are less clear. Some sources indicate that the lyrics are, at the very least, a lament from the point of view of a single soldier, but other aspects of the song, including the way it is frequently performed (see cultural context section), has led to conflicting claims that the song is a tribute to African soldiers of World War II or a criticism of Africans who collaborated with European colonial authorities.\n\nThe song is still used today almost everywhere in Africa by soldiers, policemen, boy scouts, sportsmen, and their supporters, usually during training or for rallying. It is particularly popular in Cameroon, where it is used as a marching song or rallying cry.\n\nThe song was popularized in Colombia under the name \"the Military\" by West African DJs based in Cartagena.\n\nIn the music video for the 1986 release and in other performances of the song, performers often dress in military uniforms, wearing pith helmets and stuffing their clothes in certain places with pillows to give the appearance of being well-off and associated with European colonial authorities. This appearance and the lyrics, according to some music historians, is a criticism of African military officers who were in league with whites and profited from the oppression of their own people during the era of European imperialist colonization.\n\nSome elements of the song incorporate Cameroonian slang and Cameroonian military jargon from World War II.\n\nAccording to Jean Paul Zé Bella, the lead singer of Golden Sounds, the chorus came \"from Cameroonian sharpshooters who had created a slang for better communication between them during the Second World War\"; the band initially recreated the fast pace of the military communication in their first arrangements of the song.\n\nThe song became internationally popular when the international pop star Shakira released a variant (as a tribute to African music) titled \"Waka Waka (This Time For Africa)\" in anticipation of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.\n\nBefore \"Waka Waka (This Time For Africa)\" was released in 2010, the song was sampled or covered by other artists, including:\n\n\n"}
